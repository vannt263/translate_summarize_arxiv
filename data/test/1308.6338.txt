    "the discovery of the @xmath0 gev scalar particle @xcite with the properties of the standard model higgs boson together with the so far negative results for searches of supersymmetry are pointing to a possibility of a very different model building paradigm based on a minimally extended standard model with manifest classical scale invariance . in this paper",
    "we will present the first , to the best of our knowledge , realisation of a slow - roll cosmological inflation mechanism in a classically scale - invariant bsm theory .",
    "the rational for advocating this ` heretical ' approach to model building based on classical scale invariance is as follows .",
    "first point in favour of ( approximate ) scale symmetry is a well - known ` experimental ' fact that there is just a single occurrence of a non - dynamical scale in the standard model ( sm )  the higgs mass - squared input parameter @xmath1  appearing in the sm higgs potential , @xmath2 by selecting a particular negative value for it , an expectation value @xmath3 for the higgs field , and the higgs mass @xmath4 are obtained , @xmath5 .",
    "classical scale invariance , broken by @xmath1 , is recovered by re - interpreting this scale in terms of a vacuum expectation value of a new scalar @xmath6 , coupled to the sm via the higgs portal interaction , @xmath7 @xmath8 the classical theory described by is scale - invariant , and insofar as the appropriate natural value for @xmath9 can be generated quantum mechanically , it will trigger the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "already 40 years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite coleman and weinberg discovered that a massless scalar field @xmath6 coupled to a gauge field dynamically generates a vacuum expectation value via dimensional transmutation of the logarithmically running coupling constants .",
    "the @xmath10 is non - vanishing , calculable in a weakly - coupled theory , and its value is naturally small ( i.e. exponentially suppressed ) relative to the uv cutoff of the theory , @xmath11 \\ , \\ll m_{\\sst uv}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the gauge coupling of @xmath6 . in the appendix we review the coleman - weinberg mechanism to recall some of the key expressions for the convenience of the reader .    in the sm@xmath13u(1)@xmath14 theory with the classical scalar potential ,",
    "the @xmath6-vev in then generates the higgs vev @xmath15 and the higgs mass @xmath16 , as dictated by , @xmath17 and one an set @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the u(1)@xmath14 theory coupled to the sm via the higgs portal with the scalar potential was first considered in @xcite .",
    "note that no input mass scales are allowed in the coleman - weinberg theory and , in the course of uv renormalisation , the subtraction scheme is chosen to set the _ renormalised masses _ at the origin of the field space to zero , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the quantum - corrected effective potential .",
    "does the masslessness condition amount to a fine - tuning ?    a theory with no input mass - scales is classically scale invariant  @xcite .",
    "the scale invariance is not exact , but neither it is broken by an arbitrary amount .",
    "the violation of scale invariance is controlled in quantum theory by the anomaly in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , or in other words , by the logarithmic running of dimensionless coupling constants and their dimensional transmutation scales which , in the weakly coupled perturbation theory , are much smaller than the uv cutoff .",
    "bardeen has argued in @xcite that in order to maintain anomalously broken scale invariance , one should select a regularisation scheme which does not explicitly break classical scale invariance ( so that it does not introduce positive powers of the uv cutoff scale into renormalised quantities ) .    in dimensional regularisation ,",
    "the equation is satisfied automatically .",
    "indeed , no power - like dependences on the cutoff scale appear in dimensional regularisation , and in theories like ours , which contain no explicit mass scales at the outset , no finite corrections to mass terms at the origin of the field space can appear either . in this regularisation which preserves classical scale invariance ,",
    "the theory as it stands is not fine - tuned , at least , not in the technical sense .",
    "if the higher theory above the planck scale breaks the classical scale invariance of its ir effective theory , through heavy degrees of freedom coupled to the standard model , then from the perspective of this microscopic theory , the masslessness condition does amount to a fine - tuning .",
    "but from the perspective of our sub - planckian theory used for particle physics computations , there is no fine - tuning , and no practical problems arise associated e.g. with cancellations between large scales , etc .",
    "furthermore , once the masslessness condition is enforced at one scale , it holds at all rg scales @xcite . to summarise , within dimensional regularisation , the renormalisation condition and , more generally , equations , @xmath23 are self - consistent , contain no fine - tuning in the theory at hand , and are independent of the rg - scale .    the phenomenology of the sm@xmath13u(1)@xmath14 model in the context of lhc , future colliders and low energy measurements was analysed recently in @xcite .",
    "the minimal model has only two remaining free parameters , the portal coupling , @xmath24 and the mass of the second scalar eigenstate @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 being the observed higgs mass ) .",
    "] , and it was shown that the model is perfectly viable .",
    "in particular , the presently available higgs data constrains the portal coupling to be @xmath27 on the part of the parameter space where the second scalar is in the region between @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 . for heavier @xmath25 ,",
    "the portal coupling is much less constrained experimentally , and has a theoretical upper limit of @xmath30 , see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail .",
    "other related studies of classically scale - invariant models can be found in  @xcite .",
    "as the resulting theory has to be valid up to a very large uv scale , the classical scale invariance provides a powerful principle for the bsm model building .",
    "no vastly different scales which is treated separately .",
    "] can co - exist in the theory : first , it is difficult to generate a large hierarchy of scales from the same @xmath31 .",
    "secondly , the large scales , if they do appear , would ultimately couple to the higgs and would destabilise it mass .",
    "the bsm theory is a minimal extension of the sm which should address all the sub - planckian shortcomings of the sm , such as the generation of matter - anti - matter asymmetry , inflation , dark matter , stabilisation of the sm higgs potential , without introducing scales higher than @xmath31 which itself is not much higher the electroweak scale .",

    "the @xmath32 model @xcite is an appealing extension of the sm as it automatically contains three generations of right - handed majorana neutrinos necessary ( needed to cancel the gauge anomaly of u(1)@xmath33 ) .",
    "the standard see - saw mechanism generates masses of visible neutrinos and facilitate neutrino oscillations . the cw field @xmath6 carries the @xmath32 charge 2 and its vev generates the majorana neutrino masses and the mass of the u(1)@xmath33 @xmath34 boson . in the classically conformal settings , these models were first considered in @xcite . as well - known , however , the standard thermal leptogenesis formalism  @xcite requires very heavy majorana neutrino masses of the order of @xmath35 gev , to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "such heavy neutrino masses go against the grain of our classically scale - invariant approach .    ref .",
    "@xcite used a different realisation of the leptogenesis mechanism proposed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite  the leptogenesis due to flavour oscillations of the right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the the classically - invariant sm@xmath13u(1)@xmath33 model can generate the observed matter - anti - matter asymmetry on a large portion of the model parameter space without introducing any additional mass scales and without requiring any resonant fine - tuning .",
    "the majorana masses are in the range between 200 mev and 500 gev ; they , together with and a heavier mass for the z boson , are generated by the cw vev @xmath31 .",
    "( 4 . ) _ vacuum stability : _ it is well - known that in the standard model the higgs quartic coupling becomes negative rendering the higgs effective potential unstable at above the scale @xmath36 gev .",
    "the next - to - next - to leading order analysis of the sm higgs effective potential carried out in @xcite found the best - fit value of the higgs self - coupling at the planck scale to be small but negative , @xmath37 with further refinements carried out in @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath38 and its beta function nearly vanish at the planck scale , but without new physics , the absolute stability of the standard model higgs potential is ruled out @xcite .    a minimal and robust way to repair the electroweak vacuum stability",
    "is provided by the higgs portal extension of the sm  and this is provided automatically in the classically scale - invariant theory .",
    "there are two effects helping to stabilise the vacuum : first is the fact that the portal coupling gives a positive contribution to the beta function of the higgs quartic coupling , @xmath39 .",
    "the second effect occurs due to a vev of the second scalar , @xmath40 , leading to mixing between @xmath6 and the higgs and resulting in a threshold correction lifting the sm higgs self - coupling @xcite . in the present context of classically scale - invariant sm",
    "@xmath13 u(1)@xmath14 theory , the vacuum stabilisation was addressed in recent papers refs .",
    "the values and ranges of the couplings needed to stabilise the higgs potential depend on the model specific rg - running .",
    "gauge group . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that for the values of the portal coupling @xmath41 and the non - abelian cw coupling @xmath42 , the vacuum stability is recovered ( here the second scalar is heavy , @xmath43 gev ) .",
    "more generally , in ref.@xcite the allowed regions on the entire parameter space @xmath44 consistent with the vacuum stability and perturbativity were determined for @xmath45 and for @xmath46 , we refer to their fig .  1 for more detail . vacuum stability in the sm @xmath13 u(1)@xmath47 theory was addressed in @xcite and @xcite following a more constrained than our approach , where the vanishing ( rather than just positivity ) of the higgs potential was requested at @xmath48 . ] the conclusion we draw from this work is that the vacuum stability up to the planck scale is effectively restored on large portions of the parameter space for classically conformally invariant extensions of the standard model .",
    "we also mention that adding an additional singlet to the theory coupled to the higgs via a portal will further enhance the stability of the potential .",
    "_ inflation _ and _ dark matter _ within the classically scale - invariant bsm formulation is the subject of the present paper . in the following section we will extend the higgs portal model by introducing a single real scalar field @xmath49 with a non - minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "an exponentially flat potential for the singlet will be generated , as required for a successful implementation of a slow - roll cosmological inflation , preserving the classical scale invariance of the model and without the need of perturbative unitarisation at sub - planckian scales .",
    "quite pleasingly , the singlet @xmath49 is protected by a @xmath50 symmetry and gives a viable candidate for dark matter .",
    "thus the roles of the inflation and of the scalar dark matter particle are unified and are straightforwardly incorporated in the context of the classically scale - invariant higgs - portal bsm model .",
    "in the standard big bang cosmology the cosmological inflation was proposed in  @xcite to solve the flatness , isotropy , homogeneity , horizon and relic problems .",
    "inflation is the leading theory of the early universe , confirmed by observations including the recent data from planck satellite @xcite which favour a simple inflationary scenario with only one slow rolling scalar field .",
    "slow - roll inflation occurs in many models constructed in the past , although , in general , the underlying microscopic particle physics of many inflation models is still unknown , as it involves energy scales far higher than can be probed at colliders .",
    "we will focus on the approach based on renormalisable qft lagrangians , which are then coupled to gravity , and in addition to the usual einstein - hilbert term also involve a non - minimal coupling of a scalar field to gravity . by taking the non - minimal coupling @xmath51 to be large ,",
    "a flat slow - roll potential is generated and inflation takes place , as originally discussed in @xcite .    an interesting extremely minimal proposal which bridges cosmology with the standard model particle physics is that the higgs itself could play the role of the inflaton @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath52 however introduces two sub - planckian scales in the theory , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the theory appears to violate unitarity , thus spoiling the self - consistency of the inflationary approach , which has lead to a considerable debate in the literature as to whether such models make sense quantum mechanically  @xcite . from now and for the rest of this section",
    "we will be using the reduced planck mass @xmath55 gev and will refer to it simply as @xmath56 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the higgs inflation model can be unitarised by introducing ( or integrating in ) a new scalar with the mass @xmath57 participating in the inflation .",
    "this allowed the authors of @xcite to raise the unitarity bound up to the planck scale , well above the inflationary scale @xmath58 .",
    "this approach however is incompatible with the requirement of classical scale invariance of the theory which we want to maintain .",
    "the mass @xmath59 of the new scalar field , which interacts with the higgs , is a non - dynamical input scale . upon integrating out this massive degree of freedom",
    "the higgs mass is destabilised and requires fine - tuning .",
    "we take an alternative approach to inflation which is based on a classically _ massless _ and vev - less real scalar field @xmath60 .",
    "our inflaton is neither the higgs itself as in ref .",
    "@xcite , nor the heavy scalar as in ref .",
    "our approach is also different from the singlet - assisted higgs portal inflation of refs .",
    "@xcite where the inflaton was a combination of the higgs and the singlet with a non - vanishing vev ( for earlier and related work see also @xcite and references therein ) . with the inflaton ( or more precisely the non - minimally coupled to gravity scalar ) being a single - component field , we will be able to avoid problems with violations of unitarily at intermediate scales in pure gravity and kinetic sectors , along the same lines as in @xcite .",
    "we start from the classical scalar potential of the sm coupled to the cw sector which we rewrite as @xmath61 here the new @xmath6-self - coupling @xmath62 is defined in terms of the original parameters of via a shift @xmath63 .",
    "we now extend this model by adding a single degree of freedom , a one - component real scalar field @xmath49 .",
    "it is a gauge singlet which is coupled to the @xmath64 theory only via the scalar portal interactions with the higgs and @xmath6 , @xmath65 equations - describe the general renormalisable gauge - invariant scalar potential for the three massless scalars , @xmath66 as required by the classical scale invariance of the theory .",
    "the coupling constants in the potential are taken to be all positive ( or at least non - negative ) , thus the potential is stable and the positivity of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ensure that no vev is generated for the singlet @xmath49 .",
    "instead the cw vev @xmath31 generates the mass terms for the singlet , @xmath69 in the vacuum @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "we now proceed to couple our theory to gravity . to achieve the slow - roll inflation we need to introduce large non - minimal couplings to gravity of at least some of the scalars@xcite . as noted earlier , the central point of our approach is to non - minimally couple _ only _ the singlet @xmath60 , such that the lagrangian takes the form , @xmath73 the term @xmath74 is the non - minimal coupling of the singlet @xmath60 to gravity , with @xmath75 being the scalar curvature .",
    "it will follow that for successful inflation the value of the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath76 should be relatively large , @xmath77 . for this reason , we will treat @xmath76 ( and @xmath78 ) as large parameters @xmath79 . in this sense , @xmath60 is distinguished from the two other scalars , @xmath80 and @xmath6 , which in our case have either vanishing or small loop - induced non - minimal gravitational couplings ( @xmath81 and",
    "thus are neglected in without loss of generality ) .",
    "@xmath82 gev denotes the reduced planck mass ; in the lagrangian @xmath56 appears only in the einstein - hilbert term and does not couple directly to non - gravitational degrees of freedom .",

    "can be recast in terms of the vev of the dilation of the spontaneously broken local scale invariance . in dimensional",

    "_ of contains the scalar potential and , plus radiative corrections , plus kinetic terms for gauge and fermion fields and yukawa interactions .",
    "an immediate question arises concerning the non - minimal coupling of the singlet @xmath60 to gravity , @xmath84 in : will the appearance of the relatively large coupling @xmath85 render the theory ill - defined at an intermediate scale @xmath86 which is below the high scale @xmath56 ?",
    "if one expands around the flat space , @xmath87 , the non - minimal coupling generates the dimension-5 @xmath88 interaction .",
    "this interaction generates contributions to e.g. the @xmath89 scattering processes mediated by the graviton exchange .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when summed over @xmath60 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 channels , the leading order in @xmath76 contributions to this process cancel , and the first non - vanishing effects are suppressed by the high scale ( planck mass @xmath56 ) ; thus the theory in this sector appears to be safe up to the gravity scale @xmath56 , and as such is well - behaved at the intermediate scale @xmath86 . for the cancellation to occur it is however essential that there is only a single scalar non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "so , the theory coupled to gravity as defined by its lagrangian in the jordan frame appears to be safe up to the high uv scale @xmath56 and the appearance of the relatively large non - minimal coupling @xmath76 does not immediately invalidate the theory at lower intermediate scales .",
    "we will return to this point in what follows .",
    "we now perform a metric transformation to the einstein frame where the non - minimal scalar to gravity interaction is removed , @xmath92 so that the lagrangian becomes , @xmath93 as expected , the non - minimal interaction of @xmath60 with the scalar curvature @xmath75 has disappeared .",
    "the price for this is the non - canonical normalisation of the kinetic term for @xmath60 .",

    "of course this is the einstein frame reflection of the same phenomenon we have already considered in the jordan frame ( see the paragraph above ) .",
    "for the same reason , in the class of models considered here , where the non - minimal coupling to gravity involves a _",
    "real scalar , the appearance of this scale in the kinetic term is harmless .",
    "it turns out that the contribution to @xmath89 scattering of the 4-point vertex is vanishing when the external states are put on - shell @xcite .",
    "this is true at tree - level and continues to hold to arbitrary loop order .",
    "the underlying reason for why the theory continues to be well - behaved at the intermediate scale ( at least in the scalar - kinetic sector and in the scalar - gravity sector ) is the existence of the field redefinition in the einstein frame which will render the kinetic term canonical .",
    "we will now proceed along these lines .    to bring the kinetic term for our singlet field @xmath60 into the canonical form we perform the field redefinition @xmath98 following @xcite and define the singlet field @xmath99 via @xmath100 so that @xmath101 the kinetic term for the singlet in is now brought to the canonical form , @xmath102 we note that as pointed out in @xcite , this field redefinition is possible and works only for the case of a _ single _ real scalar field coupled non - minimally to gravity  which is the case we are considering .",

    "it is important to note that if the new physics was required to be included at the scales below the uv cutoff @xmath56 , this would have destroyed the classical scale invariance of our model and induced large threshold contributions to the masses of the higgs and the cw scalar , reintroducing the fine - tinning problem into the sm .",
    "for this reason the elegant construction of ref .",
    "@xcite which integrates in a massive linear sigma - model field at the scale @xmath142 to restore the perturbative unitarity of the higgs inflation model does not work in our classically scale - invariant case .",
    "finally , we would like to briefly comment on the role of loop - induced quantum corrections to the effective potential .",
    "as explained in the introduction , our calculational approach is based on the use of dimensional regularisation where no power - like divergencies can appear . at the 1-loop level",
    "we have the coleman - weinberg corrected potential , @xmath156 which entails the derivatives of the exponentially slowly varying potential in the background of a large @xmath107-field .",
    "higher loop orders will involve higher derivatives of the flat potential enhanced by only a logarithmic dependence on the uv - cutoff . as a result",
    ", it is quite likely that quantum corrections computed in the dimensional regularisation scheme in the background perturbation theory around a large @xmath107-field will be small and not affect the picture of inflation at the leading order , see also @xcite for a more comprehensive discussion of this point .",
    "singlet scalar dark matter ( dm ) models @xcite are the simplest possible uv - complete models of dark matter containing a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp )  in this case a scalar interacting with the higgs via the portal interaction .    in the classically scale - invariant sm@xmath13u(1)@xmath14 theory with the real singlet @xmath49 and the scalar potential , the stability of the singlet is protected by a @xmath50 symmetry , @xmath157 giving a natural dark matter candidate .",
    "indeed , the @xmath50 symmetry of the potential is an automatic consequence of the renormalisability ( dimension 4 ) , scale - invariance and gauge invariance ( which does not allow odd powers of @xmath80 and @xmath6 ) of the theory .    as shown in the previous section , at large field values , @xmath158 , the singlet ( or more precisely its log in ) plays the role of the inflaton field which during the inflation slowly rolls in an exponentially flat potential . in this regime , the inflaton gives large masses to the sm fields and otherwise decouples from the rest of the theory .",
    "after inflation is completed , the singlet enters the regime @xmath159 where it is canonically normalised , its potential is no longer flat and given by , and the large masses of the sm fields are no longer there .",
    "the singlet now assumes the role of the dark matter in the classically scale - invariant theory .",
    "there are only two phenomenologically relevant parameters of this singlet dark matter model , the coupling @xmath67 of the dark matter particle to the sm higgs , and the induced mass of the singlet , @xmath160 in eq .   which gives the dark matter mass .",
    "expressed in terms of these two parameters , the dm phenomenology of this classically scale - invariant model is the same as that of the usual singlet scalar dm model .",
    "papers @xcite contain the recent comprehensive studies of the singlet scalar dm , see also references therein . here",

    "furthermore , the singlet field responsible for inflation also gives a viable scalar dark matter candidate in our model .",
    "when discussing cosmological inflation in section 2 , our classically scale invariant quantum field theory was coupled to a gravitational background with an explicit dependence on the reduced planck scale @xmath56 . how does this fit with classical scale invariance of the non - gravitational theory ?",
    "the planck scale @xmath56 , as it appears in our effective lagrangians and does not cause problems to the effective field theory . at the scale @xmath56 and above , the theory coupled to gravity of course becomes non - renormalisable , but @xmath56 is above the uv cutoff scale of our theory and gravity is treated as an external background .",
    "one can continue using dimensional regularisation in the curved background for all qft processes .",
    "the interesting for us phenomena , such as the cosmological inflation , happen at large values of the singlet field set by the intermediate scale @xmath172 , at this scale the theory is robust , the scalar inflaton @xmath99 is exponentially decoupled from the sm degrees of freedom ( in the relevant for inflation regime of large field values ) and there are no heavy degrees of freedom coupled to the sm sector present in the theory .    still it is desirable to not have an explicit scale @xmath56 present in the theory which is supposed to become classically scale - less when gravity decouples .",
    "one can do this and embed the classical scale - invariance of the theory in the ir into the scale invariance as a fundamental symmetry of nature - including gravity - with the planck scale being set by the vev of the dilaton .",
    "we stress first that this is not a necessary requirement , the classical scale invariance of the ir theory can in principle exist even if the uv - complete theory is not scale - invariant .",
    "secondly , as we will explain below , the classical scale invariance of the effective qft does not automatically follow from the ( broken ) scale invariance of the gravitational theory .",
    "it has to be seen as an additional constraint .    to proceed , we impose the scale - invariance on the full theory including gravity and assume that this is a _ local _ symmetry which is non - linearly realised ",

    "@xcite and also @xcite and references to earlier work therein for other related approaches which assume or utilise full quantum scale invariance of the underlying theory .",
    "thus our original lagrangian can be written in a manifestly locally scale - invariant ( weyl - invariant ) form if we retrofit the planck scale in terms of the dilaton vev , @xmath173 and introduce the kinetic term for the dilaton ( see section iii of @xcite for a review of a general construction ) , @xmath174 where the dots indicate omitted kinetic terms of other fields , and @xmath22 is the scalar potential which must scale as the 4th power of the scalars , which our potential does ( see the discussion above ) .",

    "note that the dilaton kinetic term in has the ` wrong ' sign , but this is not a problem @xcite , since the dilaton is not a physical degree of freedom - it can be gauged away .",
    "( this also means that there are no additional massless or light degrees of freedom arising from the dilaton , thus no complications for the sm . ) in the unitary gauge we have @xmath177    the dilaton spontaneously breaks local scale invariance of the gravitational theory at the scale @xmath56 , and gives the mass gap @xmath178 to heavy gravitational states . in order to maintain the classical scale invariance of the sm theory",
    ", the graviton should not couple to any of the sm states in the potential @xmath22 in .",
    "this should be seen as an additional requirement ( rather than an automatic consequence ) to the local scale invariance of the microscopic theory .",

    "one treats the metric tensor @xmath182 as a @xmath183 matrix , and in the einstein frame , it introduces the dependence on the dilaton .",
    "the result is that in our theory with spontaneously broken ( or non - linearly realised scale - invariance ) , the every appearance of the rg scale @xmath179 in the effective potential is now substituted by , see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath184 which now transforms under scale - transformations .",
