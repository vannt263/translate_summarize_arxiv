    "quantum theory stipulates a lower bound on the product of the uncertainties of in a pair of non - commuting observables such as the position and momentum , the phase and particle number , etc . in the context of the position - momentum uncertainty relation @xmath0 , there are states which satisfy @xmath1 .",

    "of all the mus , the coherent states @xmath2@xcite , = ( -)_n=0^n , defined for every complex number @xmath3 , are very special as their phase space distributions ( p- and wigner - distributions ) are well - defined probability densities@xcite .",

    "it is possible to make the atom - field coupling to be time - dependent and its form can be tailored to generate arbitrary superpositions@xcite .",
    "another route to realize the type of the intensity - dependent coupling is to consider situations in which the rotating - wave approximation is not suitable and the resulting hamiltonian is equivalent to including an intensity - dependent interaction of the form @xmath55 , which approximates the operator @xmath56 when @xmath57@xcite , wherein the expectation value @xmath58 is in the state @xmath59 .",
