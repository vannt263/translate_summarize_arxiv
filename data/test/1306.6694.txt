    "the study of the equation of state ( eos ) , transport properties , and mixing rules of hydrogen ( h ) and helium ( he ) under extreme condition of high pressure and temperature is not only of fundamental interest but also of essential practical applications for astrophysics @xcite .",
    "for instance , giant planets such as jupiter and saturn require accurate eos as the basic input into the respective interior models in order to solve hydrostatic equation and investigate the solubility of the rocky core @xcite . on the other side , the evolution of stars and the design of thermal protection system is assisted by high precision transport coefficients of h - he mixtures at high pressure @xcite . in addition ,",
    "the viscosity and mutual diffusion coefficients are also important input properties for hydrodynamic simulations in modelling the stability of the hot spot - fuel interfaces and the degree of fuel contamination in inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite .    since direct experimental access such as shock wave experiments",
    "is limited in the mbar regime @xcite , the states deep in the interior of jupiter ( @xmath2 mbar ) and saturn ( @xmath3 mbar ) @xcite can not be duplicated in the laboratory . as a consequence ,",
    "theoretical modelling provides most of the insight into the internal structure of giant planets .",
    "the eos of h - he mixtures have been treated by a linear mixing ( lm ) of the individual eos via fluid perturbation theory @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite . recently , several attempts have been made to calculate eos of h - he mixtures by means of quantum molecular dynamic ( qmd ) simulations .",
    "@xcite applied local density approximation of density functional theory ( lda - dft ) calculations for solid h - he mixtures , implying demixing for jupiter and saturn at 15000 k for a he fraction of @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite , lorenzen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and militzer @xcite performed qmd simulations by using generalized gradient expansion ( gga ) instead of the lda in order to evaluate the accuracy of the lm approximation and study the demixing of h - he at mbar pressures .",
    "@xcite introduced car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) simulations to calculate the excess gibbs free energy of mixing at a lower temperature compared to that set in the work of lorenzen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and militzer @xcite .    considering the transport properties , qmd @xcite and orbital - free molecular dynamics ( ofmd ) @xcite simulations",
    "have been introduced to study hydrogen and its isotropic deuterium ( d ) and tritium ( t ) .",
    "self - diffusion coefficients in the pure h system and mutual diffusion for d - t mixtures were determined for temperatures @xmath51 to 10 ev and equivalent h mass densities 0.1 to 8.0 g / cm@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "qmd and ofmd simulations of self - diffusion , mutual diffusion , and viscosity have recently been performed on heavier elements ( fe , au , be ) @xcite and on mixtures of li and h @xcite .",
    "the present work selects h - he mixture as a representative system and examines some of the standard mixing rules with respect to the eos and transport properties ( viscosity , self and mutual diffusion coefficients ) in the warm dense regime that covers standard extreme condition as reached in the interiors of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the thermophysical properties of the full mixture and the individual species have been derived from qmd simulations , where the electrons are quantum mechanically treated through finite - temperature ( ft ) dft and ions move classically . in the next section , we present the formalism for qmd and for determining the static and transport properties .",
    "then , eos , viscosity , and diffusion coefficients for h - he mixtures are presented , and the qmd results are compared with the results from reduced models and qmd based linear mixing models . finally , concluding remarks are given .",
    "in this section , a brief description of the fundamental formalism employed to investigate h - he mixtures is introduced .",
    "the basic quantum mechanical density functional theory forms the basis of our simulations .",
    "the implementation of schemes in determining diffusion and viscosity is discussed . mixing rules that combine pure species quantities to form composite properties",
    "is also presented .",
    "qmd simulations have been performed for h - he mixtures by using vienna _",
    "ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . in these simulations , the electrons are treated fully quantum mechanically by employing a plane - wave ft - dft description , where the electronic states follow the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the ions move classically according to the forces from the electron density and the ion - ion repulsion .",
    "simulations have been performed in the nvt ( canonical ) ensemble where the number of particles @xmath7 and the volume are fixed .",
    "the system was assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the electron and ion temperatures being equal ( @xmath8 ) . in these calculations ,",
    "the electronic temperature has been kept constant according to fermi - dirac distribution , and ion temperature is controlled by noe thermostat @xcite .    at each step during md simulations , a set of electronic state functions [ @xmath9 for each * k*-point",
    "are determined within kohn - sham construction by @xmath10 with @xmath11 in which the four terms respectively represent the kinetic contribution , the electron - ion interaction , the hartree contribution and the exchange - correlation term . the electronic density is obtained by @xmath12 then by applying the velocity verlet algorithm , based on the force from interactions between ions and electrons , a new set of positions and velocities are obtained for ions .",
    "all simulations are performed with 256 atoms and 128 atoms for pure species of h and he , and as for the case of the h - he mixture , a total number of 245 atoms ( 234 h atoms and 11 he atoms ) for a mixing ratio @xmath13 ( corresponding to the h - he immiscibility region determined in the work of morales _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) has been adopted , where a cubic cell of length @xmath14 ( volume @xmath15 ) is periodically repeated .",

    "the convergence of the thermodynamic quantities plays an important role in the accuracy of qmd simulations . in the present work ,",
    "a plane - wave cutoff energy of 1200 ev is employed in all simulations so that the pressure is converged within 2% .",
    "we have also checked out the convergence with respect to a systematic enlargement of the * k*-point set in the representation of the brillouin zone . in the molecular dynamic simulations ,",
    "only the @xmath16 point of brillouin zone is included .",
    "the dynamic simulation is lasted 20000 steps with time steps of 0.2 @xmath17 0.7 fs according to different densities and temperatures . for each pressure and temperature ,",
    "the system is equilibrated within 0.5 @xmath17 1 ps .",
    "the eos data are obtained by averaging over the final 1 @xmath17 3 ps molecular dynamic simulations .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath18 can either be calculated from the trajectory by the mean - square displacement @xmath19 or by the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the position and @xmath22 is the velocity of the @xmath23th nucleus . only in the long - time limit , these two formulas of @xmath18 are formally equivalent .",
    "sufficient lengths of the trajectories have been generated to secure contributions from the velocity autocorrelation function to the integral is zero , and the mean mean - square displacement away from the origin consistently fits to a straight line .",
    "the diffusion coefficient obtained from these two approaches lie within 1 % accuracy of each other .",
    "here , we report the results from velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "we have also computed the mutual - diffusion coefficient @xmath24 from the autocorrelation function @xmath25 with @xmath26 where the concentration and particle number of species @xmath27 are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and the total number of particles in the simulation box @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 is the thermodynamic factor related to the second derivation of the gibbs free energy with respect to concentrations @xcite . in the present simulations ,",
    "@xmath31 value has been adopted equal to unity since studies with leonard - jones and other model potentials have shown that for dissimilar constituents the @xmath31-factor departs from unity by about 10% @xcite .",
    "the viscosity @xmath32 has been computed from the autocorrelation function of the off - diagonal component of the stress tensor @xcite @xmath33 the results are averaged from the five independent off - diagonal components of the stress tensor @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "different from the self - diffusion coefficient , which involves single - particle correlations and attains significant statistical improvement from averaging over the particles , the viscosity depends on the entire system and thus needs very long trajectories so as to gain statistical accuracy . to shorten the length of the trajectory , we use empirical fits @xcite to the integrals of the autocorrelation functions .",
    "thus , extrapolation of the fits to @xmath39 can more effectively determine the basic dynamical properties .",
    "both of the @xmath18 and @xmath40 have been fit to the functional in the form of @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are free parameters .",
    "reasonable approximation to the viscosity can be produced from the finite time fitting procedure , which also serves to damp the long - time fluctuations .",
    "the fractional statistical error in calculating a correlation function @xmath44 for molecular - dynamics trajectories @xcite can be given by @xmath45 where @xmath43 is the correlation time of the function , and @xmath46 is the length of the trajectory .",

    ", we examine two representative mixing rules .",
    "the first , termed density - matching rule ( mrd ) with the inspiration of a two - species ideal gas .",
    "the second , termed pressure - matching rule ( mrp ) , which follows from two interacting immiscible fluids .    in the mrd",
    ", the volume of the individual species is set equal to that of the mixture ( @xmath48 ) , and qmd simulations are performed for h at a density of @xmath49 and he at @xmath50 at a temperature @xmath51 .",
    "then , pressure predicted by mrd is determined by simply adding the individual pressures from the pure species h and he simulations .",
    "other transport coefficients , such as mutual diffusion and viscosity , follow the same prescription and are summarized as @xmath52 the superscript is used to denote values predicted from mrd .",
    "the derived pressure based on density mixing rule generally follows from the ideal noninteracting h and he gas in a volume @xmath53 .",
    "the mrp has a more complicated construction compared to mrd .",
    "mrp can be characterized as the following prescription : @xmath54 in this case , we have performed a series of qmd simulations on the individual species h and he , where the volumes change under a constraint @xmath55 until the individual pressures equal to each other @xmath56 .",
    "the total pressure becomes the predicted value .",
    "here , we use the excess or electronic pressure @xmath57 to evaluate this mrp mixing rule .",
    "composite properties such as mutual diffusion and viscosity are evaluated by combining the individual species results via volume fractions @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we also derive properties of the mixture from a slightly more complex mixing rule @xcite , as so - called binary ionic mixture ( bim ) : @xmath59 with @xmath60 the predicted mutual - diffusion coefficient or the viscosity .",
    "the subscript @xmath61 denotes the mixture and @xmath23 the pure species .",
    "in this section , the wealth of information derived from qmd calculations are mainly presented through figures , and the general trends of the eos as well as transport coefficients are concentrated in the text .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to explore not only to get insight into the interior physical properties of giant gas planets but also to examine a series of mixing rules for hydrogen and helium .",
    "additionally , one can consider the influence of helium on the eos and transport coefficients of mixing .",
    "high precision eos data of hydrogen and helium are essential for understanding the evolution of jupiter and target implosion in icf .",
    "experimentally , the eos of hydrogen and helium in the fluid regime have been studied through gas gun @xcite , chemical explosive @xcite , magnetic driven plate flyer @xcite , and high power laser @xcite . since these experiments were limited by the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy , the explored density of warm dense matter",
    "were limited within @xmath62 times of the initial density .",
    "recently , a new technique combined diamond anvil cell ( dac ) and high intensity laser pulse has successfully been proved to provide visible ways to generate shock huguniot data of hydrogen over a significantly broader density - temperature regime than previous experiments @xcite",
    ". however , the density therein was still restricted within 1 g / cm@xmath1 .        in our simulations , wide range eos for h",
    ", he , and h - he mixtures have been determined according to qmd method .",
    "the eos can be divided into two parts that is , contributions from the noninteracting motion of ions ( @xmath63 ) and the electronic term ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 where @xmath64 is calculated directly through dft . in fig .",

    ", we do not find any signs indicating a liquid - liquid phase transition ( @xmath66 ) or plasma phase transition ( @xmath67 ) , which are characterized by molecular dissociation and ionization of electrons , respectively . with considering the mixing of he into h ,",
    "the electronic pressure is effectively reduced , as has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_eos1 ] ( b ) .",
    "mrd accounts for contribution from noninteracting h and he subsystems in the volume of the mixtures . in mrd ,",
    "the pressure contributed from noninteracting ions is the same as that of the mixture , but the electronic pressure is much lower due to the low electronic density in the pure species simulations .",
    "it is indicated that the electronic pressure is underestimated by mrd model at about 8% @xmath17 9% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_eos2 ] ) . for mrp model",
    ", we have firstly performed a series of pure species simulations at a wider density ( temperature ) regime compared to h - he mixtures .",

    "[ fig_eos2 ] .",
    "it is indicated that the mrp model agrees better with direct qmd simulations ( accuracy within 3% ) , the difference mainly come from the ionic interactions between h and he species after mixing .       and 8 g / cm@xmath1 , respectively .",

    "qmd simulations have been performed within the framework of ft - dft to benchmark the dynamic properties of h , he , and h - he mixture in the wdm regime .",
    "illustrations for the self - diffusion coefficients and viscosity ( for h and he at densities of 2.0 g / cm@xmath1 and 8.0 g / cm@xmath1 , respectively ) at a temperature 12000 k , as well as their fits are shown in fig . [ fig_dandeta ] .",
    "the trajectory of the present simulations lasts 4.0 @xmath17 14.0 ps , and correlation times between 1.0 and 15.0 fs . as a consequence ,",
    "the computational error for the viscosity lies within 10% .",
    "after accounting for the fitting error and extrapolation to infinite time , a total uncertainty of @xmath17 20% can be estimated .",
    "the uncertainty in the self - diffusion coefficients is smaller than 1% , due to the additional @xmath70 advantage given by particle average .    .",
    "for helium , the density is 8 g / cm@xmath1 .",
    "the electron number density for pure species ( h and he ) is @xmath71/m@xmath1 .",
    "]    dynamic properties of wdm are generally governed by two dimensionless quantities , namely , ionic coupling ( @xmath16 ) and electronic degenerate ( @xmath72 ) parameter .",
    "the former one is defined by the ratio of the potential to kinetic energy @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the ionic charge , and @xmath75 the ion - sphere radius ( @xmath76 is the number density ) . the latter one @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is fermi temperature .",
    "it has been reported that dynamic properties such as diffusion coefficients and viscosity can be represented purely in terms of ionic coupling parameter @xmath16 according to molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulations based on one component plasma ( ocp ) model @xcite , where ions move classically in a neutralizing background of electrons .",

    "based on classical molecular dynamic simulations , bastea @xcite has fitted the viscosity into the following form @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "since ocp model is restricted to a fully ionized plasma , we use @xmath74=1.0 ( or 2.0 ) for hydrogen ( or helium ) to compute the self - diffusion coefficient and viscosity . in fig .",

    "we would like to stress that in some mixture studies based on average atom models , the properties of pure species are derived from perturbed - atom models , where boundary conditions are introduced from the surrounding medium by treating a single atom within a cell . in the present work ,",
    "the dynamic properties of different mixing rules originate from qmd calculations of the individual species . despite divorced of the h -",
    "he interactions , the pure species calculations still contain complex intra - atomic interactions based on large samples of atoms .",

    "in summary , we have performed systematic qmd simulations of h , he , and h - he mixture in the warm dense regime for electron number density ranging from @xmath0/m@xmath1 and for temperatures from 4000 to 20000 k. the present study concentrated on thermophysical properties such as the eos , diffusion coefficient , and viscosity , which are of crucial interest in astrophysics and icf .",
    "various mixing rules have been introduced to predict dynamical properties from qmd simulations of the pure species and compare with direct calculations on the fully interacting mixture .",
    "we have shown that mrd and mrp rules produce pressures within about 10 % of the h - he mixture , however , the mutual diffusion coefficients are as different as 75 % and it is 50 % for the viscosity .",

    "<S> thermophysical properties of hydrogen , helium , and hydrogen - helium mixtures have been investigated in the warm dense matter regime at electron number densities ranging from @xmath0/m@xmath1 and temperatures from 4000 to 20000 k via quantum molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the dynamical properties such as the equation of states , diffusion coefficients , and viscosity . mixing rules ( density matching , pressure matching , and binary ionic mixing rules ) </S>",
    "<S> have been validated by checking composite properties of pure species against that of the fully interacting mixture derived from qmd simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these mixing rules reproduce pressures within 10% accuracy , while it is 75 % and 50 % for the diffusion and viscosity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> binary ionic mixing rule moves the results into better agreement . </S>",
    "<S> predictions from one component plasma model are also provided and discussed . </S>"
