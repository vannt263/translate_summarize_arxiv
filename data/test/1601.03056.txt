    "it could be that quasar clustering strongly declines with luminosity at high redshift , meaning that current samples only trace the most strongly clustered sources .",
    "but , faint quasars do not appear to cluster significantly more weakly than bright quasars at @xmath9 @xcite or below ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if quasar clustering is highly luminosity - dependent at @xmath10 , then quasars ( as a population ) would have to alter rapidly over 10% of the hubble time , then change more quiescently over the final 80% of cosmic history .",
    "further , most models invoke a narrow range of halo mass for a wide range of quasar luminosity in order to reproduce the quasar luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the discussion in appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , quasars at high redshift could simply trace the growth of their parent dark matter halos while they are actively accreting .",
    "such a scenario essentially represents the maximal possible increase in clustering amplitude with redshift ; under scenarios other than this `` maximal growth '' model the correlation length of quasars should eventually diminish at high redshift .",
    "13 of @xcite illustrates this point  quasar clustering should decrease at @xmath11 for scenarios in which quasars are efficiently quenched .",
    "observations of quasar clustering at @xmath11 are currently limited to relatively small samples of highly luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "improving this situation is a significant challenge , given that it requires expensive spectroscopic campaigns targeting faint candidates at low sky density ( @xmath121  deg@xmath13 ) .",
    "one promising avenue is the study of pairs of quasars that are separated by both a small angle on the plane of the sky and by a small velocity window in redshift space .",
    "such pairs , often called `` binary quasars '' in the literature , are sufficiently rare to confirm with dedicated spectroscopic follow - up , but have a very strong clustering strength .",

    "the mmt spectra of the two objects are highly similar to the level of the @xmath81 and resolution available .",
    "we obtain a small redshift difference from fitting the emission line in the mmt spectra ; gaussian fits with the iraf _ splot _ command return @xmath82 and @xmath83 , a difference of @xmath84kms@xmath35 .",
    "however , the line is weakly detected in the qso - b  spectrum and the uncertainty on the line centroid is @xmath85kms@xmath35 , thus this difference is not significant .",
    "the ly@xmath86 lines are detected at high @xmath81 in both spectra and the line profiles in the wings are nearly identical ( fig .",

    "as it is difficult to conclusively state the velocity offset between the two spectra , in the rest of this work we adopt the difference obtained from the fits , @xmath88 .",

    "qso - b  has a clear absorption feature just blueward of ly@xmath86 at @xmath127286  while qso - a  has a transmission peak at @xmath127170 ; both of these features are significantly weaker in the opposite spectrum ( figure  [ fig : lyacompare ] ) . also , the emission from qso - a  is greater than that from qso - b .",
    "another consideration is that a configuration that produces a large separation ( 21 ) image pair of a @xmath0 quasar is highly unlikely ; only three large - separation lensed quasar systems are known in the entire sdss @xcite .",
    "large separations can arise from group- or cluster - scale lens masses .",
    "for this configuration , the peak in the expected lens redshift distribution is at @xmath89 and the probability of a source quasar at @xmath0 with an image separation @xmath90  is extremely small @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cfhtls imaging is sufficiently deep that a group - scale overdensity at @xmath91 should be immediately apparent in the optical imaging , but as figure  [ fig : colorim ] shows , there are no galaxies detected between qso - a  and qso - b , and no obvious overdensity of galaxies in the vicinity .    in conclusion ,",
    "the mismatched seds of the two objects and the lack of any obvious foreground mass to generate a wide separation lens configuration strongly argue against the lens hypothesis for this pair of objects .",

    "although cfhtls j0221 - 0342  is drawn from a deeper survey ( @xmath28 ) and thus requires extrapolation from the @xcite results , it is worth noting that both quasars have @xmath102 and are thus within the range of the stripe 82 measurement .",

    "we have discovered a pair of quasars with apparently identical redshifts of @xmath101 and a separation of 21  on the sky .",
    "a number of factors argue against the pair being gravitationally lensed images of a single source quasar .",
    "these include differences in spectral profiles and sed shapes , and the fact that no deflector is present between the two quasars in relatively deep optical imaging . assuming the quasar pair is a binary , the small projected separation ( 135 kpc proper ) and lack of a clear redshift offset implies their physical separation is quite small , within a factor of @xmath169 of the virial radius of a typical quasar - hosting dark matter halo at high redshift ( @xmath170 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this single detection of a binary at @xmath0 favors models where quasars are strongly clustered at high redshift , at least on small scales .",
    "the clustering of quasars is sensitive not only to the triggering mechanism(s ) , but also feedback effects that terminate black hole growth .",
    "globally , the quasar population experiences a `` downsizing '' trend at @xmath171 , as activity shifts to lower mass and lower luminosity systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is often thought to be due to feedback , as the most massive systems form early but rapidly shut down after their quasar phase , freezing their black hole mass while the host halos continue to grow . at high",
    "redshift the picture is murkier , with few constraints on the black hole mass and eddington ratio distributions .",
    "this is demonstrated by @xcite , who compare three disparate models for the continued growth of black holes at high redshift after their luminous quasar phase .",
    "if feedback is efficient at high redshift , the correlation length should decrease strongly with increasing redshift .",
    "if feedback is inefficient such that the black holes grow continuously until @xmath172 , the correlation length flattens out at high redshift .",
    "if quasars grow at the same rate as their host halos at @xmath173 ( the `` maximal '' growth model ) , the correlation length rises sharply , implying that quasars at @xmath0 are more strongly clustered by a factor of a few compared to the measurements at @xmath9 .    while repeating the caveat that we have only measured small - scale clustering from a single , high - luminosity binary at @xmath0 ,",
    "this observation is most consistent with a large correlation length , favoring the models in which feedback is highly inefficient .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that the eddington ratios of @xmath174 quasars are near unity across a range of luminosities , suggesting that fainter quasars are not in a `` decaying '' phase of black hole growth .",
    "it is surprising to have found two highly luminous quasars  presumably powered by @xmath175 black holes and situated in massive dark matter halos  in such close proximity at this redshift .",
    "previous searches have relied on wide - area surveys such as the sdss , whereas we surveyed only @xmath176%  of the sky and yet discovered a @xmath0 binary quasar _ bright enough to have been selected from sdss imaging_. whether this was simply a chance find will await a more comprehensive search for quasar pairs at @xmath177 .",
    "measurements of high - redshift quasar clustering on large scales are crucial to discriminating between feedback models and better understanding the early growth of the most massive black holes in the universe .",
    "such measurements are just possible today with wide - area , medium - depth fields such as sdss stripe 82 and the cfhtls , and ongoing surveys such as the des , the desi imaging surveys ( decals , bass , and mzls ) , and kids also provide the requisite combination of depth and area . obtaining a fully three - dimensional clustering measurement demands a considerable investment in spectroscopic follow - up given the low sky density ; however , if quasars do cluster strongly at high redshift ( as implied by our observations ) , a dense survey over a relatively small area could produce a statistically meaningful result .",
