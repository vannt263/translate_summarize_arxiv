    "kempe s universality theorem @xcite is one of the great theorems of theoretical mechanism science ( `` beautiful '' @xcite , `` surprising '' @xcite , `` incredible theoretical significance '' @xcite , `` shocking '' @xcite ) .",
    "it states that any bounded portion of a planar algebraic curve can be traced out by one joint of a planar linkage with revolute joints .",
    "discovered only shortly after the invention of the first straight line linkages , kempe s theorem must have been a true surprise to his contemporary kinematicians . throughout the 20th centry",
    ", it was considered a milestone result .",
    "kempe s constructive proof can be used to actually compute a linkage that draws a planar algebraic curve .",
    "however , it was clear from the beginning that this construction is of no practical relevance .",
    "it requires an excessive number of links and joints , even for curves of low degree .",
    "nowadays , an asymptotic bound of @xmath3 for the number of links necessary to draw an algebraic curve of degree @xmath0 in an ambient space of dimension @xmath4 is known @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , drawing an ellipse with a kempe linkage already requires hundreds of links @xcite",
    ". a wealth of more practical examples for algebraic curve generation can be found in the monograph @xcite . however , the constructions there are rather specific to certain classes of curves and , more importantly , use mechanical constraints different from rigid links and revolute joints .",
    "kempe s theorem talks about algebraic curves and it is natural to ask for simplifications in case of rational curves . this was done recently in @xcite where the authors constructed scissor - like linkages to draw rational planar curves .",
    "their construction is based on the factorization of certain polynomials over a non - commutative ring that describe the motion of one of the links .",
    "the upper bounds on the number of links and joints for curves of degree @xmath0 reduce dramatically to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . in this article",
    ", we extend the ideas of @xcite to rational space curves .",
    "our aim is to provide a construction that works for all rational space curves and , at the same time , to reduce the number of links and joints as far as possible . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce several new ideas that also improve the planar case .",
    "we use rational motions of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements for the link that draws the given space curve .",
    "this acknowledges the importance of circularity .",
    "if the rational space curve is entirely circular , the motion degree is particularly low @xcite and factorization of the motion polynomial is straightforward , without the need for prior degree elevation . in the non - circular case ,",
    "a degree elevation is necessary but in contrast to @xcite , we only preserve one relevant trajectory , not the complete rational motion .",
    "this allows to keep the degree lower and saves links and joints .",
    "if the curve is of degree @xmath0 and circularity @xmath1 , the bounds for links and joints are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "another advantage of our spatial approach concerns a certain defect in kempe s original construction that later was even considered a flaw ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.2 ) .",
    "kempe used parallelogram and anti - parallelogram linkages as basic building blocks of his linkages .",
    "it is well known that the configuration curves of these linkages consists of two irreducible algebraic components that intersect at flat folded positions .",
    "that is , the linkage may switch between parallelogram and anti - parallelogram mode , thus entering unwanted components of the configuration curve .",
    "the effect is that kempe s linkages draw more than the originally intended curve . at the cost of introducing additional links and joints ,",
    "this defect can be overcome by the `` bracing constructions '' of @xcite .",
    "the approach of @xcite uses anti - parallelograms and is therefore subject to the same defect and its resolution .",
    "the basic building blocks of our approach are bennett linkages whose configuration curve has only one irreducible component .",
    "thus , no additional links and joints are needed to prevent the linkage from switching modes .",
    "we also capture this in the phrase `` the configuration curve is free of spurious components '' .",
    "this article uses several results from other , recently published , papers .",
    "whenever we use such a result we give a concise summary and references .",
    "moreover , we provide algorithmic descriptions so that a reader of this paper will be able to construct linkages for drawing an arbitrary rational space curve .",
    "we continue this article with a formulation of the main theorem and an overview of its proof in . in",
    "we provide a concise introduction to dual quaternions and motion polynomials .",
    "the proof of our main theorem is done in .",
    "it is subdivided into several steps : construction of a minimal motion to the given rational curve , factorization of this motion , and subsequent linkage construction by means of `` bennett flips '' . in",
    "we present several examples to illustrate important points of our construction .",
    "our main result in this paper is a statement about linkages and bounded rational curves in three - space .",
    "a rational curve is a curve admitting a parametric equation of the shape @xmath9 with polynomials @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 .",
    "it is no restriction to assume that this parametric equation is _ reduced , _ that is , @xmath12 because we may always divide by a common factor .",
    "the _ circularity _ of a reduced parametric equation is @xmath13 .",
    "it counts the number of intersection points with the absolute conic of euclidean geometry , is a positive integer and invariant with respect to rational re - parameterizations and similarity transformations . finally , the rational curve is called _ bounded , _ if @xmath14 has no real zeros and @xmath15 .",
    "note that in this sense bounded segments of unbounded rational curves are bounded rational curves .",
    "a linkage in our context consists of a set of lines in space , called the _ joints _ , and links ( rigid bodies which could have different shapes ) that connect two or more axes .",
    "whenever two links are connected by a joint , their relative position is constrained to a rotation about their common joint .",
    "more precisely , the relative position is determined by the rotation angle about this joint with respect to a given reference configuration .",
    "the set of all tuples of possible rotation angles is called the linkage s _ configuration space . _",
    "if it is of dimension one , we call it a _ configuration curve _ and say the linkage has _ one degree of freedom .",
    "_ if this is the case , we designate one link as fixed and another as moving and call them _ fixed _ and _ moving frame , _ respectively .",
    "we view the relative displacements of the moving frame with respect to the fixed frame as a curve in @xmath16 .",
    "the _ orbit _ or _ trajectory _ of a point attached to the moving frame is the locus of all positions in space when the point is subject to all possible displacements in this curve .",
    "a linkage is called _ spherical , _ if all axes are concurrent and _ planar _ if they are parallel .",
    "the trajectories of spherical linkages are spherical curves and the trajectories of planar linkage are curves in parallel planes . for a more formal definition of ( at least planar ) linkages",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate some of these concept at hand of a bennett linkage @xcite which will play a crucial role in our linkage construction in .",
    "a bennett linkage is a spatial four - bar linkage with one degree of freedom .",
    "its four axes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the perpendiculars to two incoming edges in the vertices of a spatial parallelogram , that is , a spatial quadrilateral with equal opposite edge lengths .",
    "displays an abstract representation and a 3d model of a bennett linkage .",
    "the joint axes @xmath17 and @xmath20 are in the fixed frame while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in the moving frame .",
    "two things about bennett linkages are important to us :    * bennett linkage constitute the only type of spatial four - bar linkages with one degree of freedom and * their configuration curve consists of only one component .",
    "img / bennett ( 14,45)@xmath17 ( 16,19)@xmath18 ( 38,3)@xmath19 ( 49,36)@xmath20 ( 58,45)@xmath17 ( 61,19)@xmath18 ( 85,3)@xmath19 ( 94,36)@xmath20    here is our main result :    [ th:1 ] for every bounded rational curve of degree @xmath0 and circularity @xmath1 in three space , there exists a spatial revolute linkage with one degree of freedom with at most @xmath7 links and @xmath8 joints such that the trajectory of one point attached to the moving frame is precisely the given rational curve .    before we embark on a proof of this theorem ( which will consume large parts of this paper ) , we would like to make a few remarks :    * the theorem talks about _ bounded _ rational curves .",
    "this is necessary because all trajectories of a linkage with only revolute joints are bounded .",
    "it is , however , admissible that the rational curve parameterizes a bounded portion of an unbounded curve , for example a line segment .",
    "* boundedness also implies that @xmath0 is even and @xmath1 is an integer so that our bounds on the number of links and joints are integers as well . *",
    "the linkage of is not unique .",
    "in fact , uncountably many linkages exist .",
    "even planar or spherical curves may be drawn by spatial linkages .",
    "* however , our approach is capable of producing planar linkages for planar curves ( ) .",
    "thus , improves the bound of @xmath21 links and @xmath22 joints given by @xcite even for non - circular ( @xmath23 ) planar rational curves .",
    "* our approach can also produce spherical linkages for spherical curves . for them",
    ", the number of links and joints reduces to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ( ) . *",
    "the linkages can be constructed in such a way , that their configuration curve is free of spurious components .",
    "this is however not the case if the linkage is required to be planar or spherical .",
    "our proof of is constructive and can be translated into algorithms , mostly based on polynomial algebra over the dual quaternions .",
    "our presentation pays attention to these algorithmic approach and gives ample information for actual implementation .",
    "the proof consists of several steps .",
    "we begin by constructing a rational motion such that one point has the given rational curve as trajectory . in order to keep small the number of links and joints , it is advantageous to require a minimal motion degree in the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements . in @xcite",
    ", we proved that these properties determine a unique rational motion which may be computed in rather straightforward manner by .",
    "this rational motion is parameterized by a certain polynomial with dual quaternion coefficients which we call a `` motion polynomial '' .",
    "general motion polynomials can be written , in several ways , as products of linear motion polynomials @xcite .",
    "these factorizations correspond to the decomposition of the rational motion into products of rotations .",
    "the axes are determined by the linear motion polynomials and the rotation angles are linked by a common parameter . on these open chains of revolute joints we base our linkage construction . unfortunately , there are motion polynomials that do not allow factorizations .",
    "even worse , the motion polynomials of minimal degree with prescribed trajectory typically fall into this category .",
    "therefore , we have to artificially raise their degree in such a way that factorizations exist .",
    "this can be done by multiplying them with real polynomials as in @xcite .",
    "this does not change the underlying motion and may be advantageous in certain applied situations .",
    "however , the bounds in are only obtained by a refinement of this procedure .",
    "we right - multiplying the motion polynomial with a certain quaternion polynomial .",
    "this changes the motion but not the trajectory in question .",
    "a curious side - effect of this approach is that it may turn a planar or spherical motion into a spatial motion .    having constructed a factorizable motion polynomial to the prescribed trajectory , we have to construct a linkage . in general , it is possible to combine the open chains obtained from different factorizations to form a linkage with one degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "we do , however , not pursue this approach because , it seems difficult to prove that the resulting linkage has _ always _",
    "( not just in general ) only a single degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , spurious motion components do exist @xcite .",
    "instead , we adapt the scissor - linkage construction of @xcite to the spatial case , replacing the anti - parallelograms of planar linkages by spatial bennett linkages .",
    "this automatically guarantees that the configuration space is of dimension one and has no spurious components .",
    "this section provides an introduction to dual quaternions and their relation to space kinematics . in particular",
    ", we introduce a homomorphism between a certain subgroup of dual quaternions into @xmath16 and the important concept of motion polynomials .",

    "the statement follows from the bounds of and the observation that spherical rational curves are of maximal circularity  @xmath432 .",
    "in this section we present several examples of linkages to given rational curves .",
    "they are meant to illustrate type and properties of the linkages we obtain , the degrees of freedom we have in our construction , and how to use them in the design of linkages .",

    "the joints are labeled by their corresponding rotation quaternions .",
    "the special geometry allows to realize the links connecting @xmath321 , @xmath342 , @xmath439 and @xmath313 , @xmath311 , @xmath439 , respectively , by straight line segments .",
    "the linkage has two flat positions where all joints are collinear .",

    "thus , the motion has four components and only one of them is relevant for drawing the cardioid . using @xmath440 , we obtain a different , less symmetric , linkage to draw the same curve ( , right ) . here , the triangles @xmath321 , @xmath439 , @xmath342 and @xmath313 , @xmath439 , @xmath311 act as links , that is , they are rigid throughout the motion .",

    "the linkage is quite similar to the linkage of but requires eight links and ten joints and it is similar to the example of @xcite which was constructed in a similar manner .",
