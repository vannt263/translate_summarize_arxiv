    "x  ray binary pulsars ( xrbs ) display a common signature in their x  ray spectra : the presence of a high - energy cutoff that makes their spectra rapidly drop above @xmath04050  kev .",
    "there are only few exceptions to this general behaviour , and   is one of them : indeed , this source displays one of the hardest x ",
    "ray spectra amongst xrbs , with no steepening up to 100  kev ( @xcite ) . in those cases",
    "in which cyclotron line features are observed , the cutoff energy @xmath4 seems to be related to the cyclotron line energy through a phenomenological relation found by makishima & mihara ( 1992 ) : @xmath5 . because  is related to the neutron star magnetic field strength @xmath6 in units of @xmath7  g by the relation @xmath8  g , where @xmath2 is the gravitational redshift , a measurement of @xmath4 can give an estimate of the neutron star magnetic field .",

    "  was discovered by the _",
    "copernicus _ satellite ( @xcite ) , and soon after its discovery a 38  s pulsation was detected by the a2 experiment aboard _",

    "the optical counterpart of   was first identified with the spectroscopic binary , but subsequent observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) produced positional error boxes that excluded this star as the optical counterpart that is , up today , still unknown . since 1991",
    "  has been monitored continuously by the batse experiment aboard _",
    "cgro_. this allowed the discovery of x  ray eclipses by the stellar companion and the determination of a 10.44  d orbital period ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to the source is not known , but a lower limit of 11  kpc has been determined by assuming that the neutron star is rotating at its equilibrium period . because of its low galactic latitude , the low energy ( @xmath102  kev ) spectrum of   is very absorbed , with n@xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "_ ginga _ observations of the source revealed the presence of a soft excess , below 3  kev , modeled with a 0.3  kev blackbody ( @xcite ) .",
    "the   x  ray spectrum also displays a fluorescence iron line at @xmath06.6  kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "  was observed by the narrow field instruments ( nfis ) aboard the italian - dutch x  ray satellite  ( @xcite ) from 1998 september 4 15:41:46 to september 5 07:20:35 ut .",
    "all the nfis performed nominally during the observation , namely the two imaging instruments lecs ( 0.110  kev ; @xcite ) and mecs ( 1.510  kev ; @xcite ) , and the two mechanically collimated instruments hpgspc ( 4180  kev ; @xcite ) and pds ( 15200  kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "data were collected in direct mode , providing information on time , energy , and position .",
    "good data were selected using default criteria .",
    "the net exposure times for the four nfis were 9.2 , 26 , 11.7 , and 10.8  ks for the lecs , mecs , hpgspc , and pds , respectively .",
    "these differences are due to the constraint that the lecs must operate in satellite night time , and rocking of the collimated nfis . for the imaging nfis data were extracted from @xmath13 circular regions centered on the source position .",
    "the background for the imaging nfis was estimated from standard background blank field measurements .",
    "because of its low galactic latitude , and therefore possible contamination by background sources , we also extracted spectra from two blank @xmath13 circular regions offset by @xmath14 with respect to the source . our result on the spectral analysis",
    "does not depend on which background was used : for example , the 67  kev mecs count rate in the offset backgrounds is less than 1% of the source count rate in the same band . for the non - imaging nfis",
    "the background was monitored by rocking the collimators off - source by @xmath15 for hpgspc ( one - side rocking ) , and @xmath16 for pds ( two - side rocking ) .",
    "the off - source fields were checked for the presence of contaminating sources : one of the pds background fields was found to show an excess count rate with respect to the other , a clear signature of contaminating sources , and therefore was not used for the estimation of the source background .    the contribution of the galactic ridge ( gr ) emission was estimated by using the results from _ rxte _ observations of the galactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the ratio between the gr and the source flux is always @xmath17 , therefore we exclude any contribution of the gr emission to our spectral data .    the spectra of each  nfi were first fit separately to derive the best model able to describe the broad band spectrum .",
    "we find that the lecs and mecs spectra can be described in terms of an absorbed power law plus a gaussian line in emission , while the pds spectrum clearly presents a deviation from a pure power law , with a steepening above @xmath020  kev .",
    "we therefore used a power law , modified at low energy by photoelectrical absorption and at high energy by a cutoff , to describe the broad band spectrum .",
    "variable normalizations among the nfis , found in agreement with those obtained from the fit to the crab spectrum , were introduced to take into account known calibration uncertainties .",
    "both an exponential cutoff ( ec ) and a high - energy cutoff ( hec ; @xcite ) yield a good fit , while a thermal bremsstrahlung did not fit our data .",
    "also the smoother fermi - dirac cutoff ( @xcite ) did not adequately describe the high energy tail .",
    "an f - test shows that the probability of chance improvement ( pci ) of the @xmath3 between the ec and hec models is 78% , therefore they are statistically equivalent . in table",
    "[ tab : best_fits ] we present the best - fit parameters for both the two models .",
    "concerning the low ( @xmath103  kev ) energy part of the spectrum , our data do not show any soft excess as observed by _ ginga _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the iron line equivalent width is @xmath18  ev , in agreement with the _ ginga _ result but lower than the _",
    "heao  1 _ measurement ( @xcite ) .",

    "we can see very well how the line is significant and very broad by using the ec model , and with much less significance with the hec model .",
    "because the line width is not well constrained by the fit , we also present in table  [ tab : best_fits ] the best - fit parameters obtained by fixing the crf width at 10  kev .    in order to check",
    "if the crf is real or an artifact due to an improper modeling of the continuum , we calculated the ratio between the hpgspc and pds count rate spectra with the crab pulsar count spectrum .",
    "this ratio has the advantage of minimizing calibration uncertainties . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crab_ratio ] , top panel , we can see that this ratio does not show any evident change of slope , as observed in other pulsars ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . by multiplying the crab ratio by the functional form of the crab spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crab_ratio ] , second panel ) , _ i.e. _ a power law of index 2.1 , and diving by the functional form of the continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crab_ratio ] , third and fourth panels ) , as obtained from our spectral fits , we are able to emphasize any deviations from the continuum . this _",
    "normalized crab ratio _ technique has been successfully used to pinpoint crfs in the spectra of other x  ray pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : crab_ratio ] shows a broad line , modeled with a gaussian line centered at @xmath40  kev and @xmath41  kev ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the narrow feature at @xmath060  kev present in the pds crab ratio has @xmath43  kev if modeled with a gaussian in 5370  kev ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this value is marginally comparable with the pds energy resolution of 8.6  kev ( fwhm ; @xcite ) at @xmath45  kev .",
    "the inclusion of this feature in the broad - band fit yields a @xmath46 of 618.19/567 .",
    "an f - test shows that the pci of the @xmath3 is 17.5% . for these reasons we do not consider it as a real feature",
    "the main result obtained from the  observation of   is the clear detection of a steepening of the spectrum above 20  kev , and that this drop occurs in two steps .",
    "indeed  observations of xrbs have shown that there are actually _ two _ changes of slope in the high ( e@xmath4710  kev ) energy part of their spectra : a first change of slope occurs in the @xmath01020  kev range , while a second steepening occurs for higher energies .",
    "this is partly expressed in the form of the high - energy cutoff ( @xcite ) , that has been used to empirically describe the two - step spectral drop in these sources . in the xrb vela x1 , for example",
    ", the first change of slope occurs at @xmath024  kev and it can be misinterpreted as a crf ( @xcite ) . for ",
    "we think we are observing the same phenomenon : the high energy part of the spectrum presents two changes of slope : if we model the continuum with only one steepening , then the fit requires the presence of a second one , that can be modeled with a crf . on the other hand ,",
    "if we model the continuum with a two - step change of slope ( the hec model ) then an additional crf is not required to describe the spectral drop .",
    "the fact that we observe a broad crf is due to the fact that the   spectrum is very hard , therefore the steepening is smooth . on the other hand , in the case of a softer spectrum , like in vela x1 ,",
    "the steepening is much more abrupt , and therefore the _ false _ crf is narrower .",
    "lacking a model of the continuum able to describe this behaviour , the only way to discriminate a real crf from an artifact due to an improper modeling of the continuum is through the crab ratio , which is model independent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crab_ratios_all ] we show the normalized crab ratios from pds data obtained for a sample of xrbs observed by .",
    "a comparison with fig .  [ fig : crab_ratio ] clearly shows that the   crab ratio does not pinpoint the crf as it does for all the other xrbs .",
    "the fact that  depends on the adopted continuum seems to rule against a _ real _ crf , but it is intriguing that the makishima & mihara relation is satisfied for the   crf .",
    "furthermore , the relation between  and its fwhm , clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crab_ratios_all ] where the crf width increases as  increases , and explained in terms of doppler broadening of the electrons responsible for the resonance ( @xcite ) is fulfilled if we assume for the crf width a value of 10  kev , which is the one obtained from the hec fit , and can be considered as a lower limit for the width . in this case",
    "the   surface magnetic field strength would be ( @xmath48  g. on the other hands , this relation would not be satisfied by the broader crf .",
    "pulse phase spectroscopy should be able to resolve this ambiguity .",
