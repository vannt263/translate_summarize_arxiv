    "synchronization is a phenomenon observed in many different contexts , ranging from epidemics spreading @xcite to neuro - sciences @xcite .",
    "the analysis of simple models pursued in the last two decades has clarified several aspects of synchronization ( for a comprehensive review on the subject see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    particularly interesting both from a theoretical and an applied point of view is synchronization of chaotic systems .",
    "this is a phenomenon known since many years  @xcite with important applications , e.g. , in secure communications of digital signals , laser dynamics etc .",
    "a simple but not trivial framework to study chaotic synchronization is represented by discrete - time dynamical systems . within this context",
    ", the essence of the phenomenon can be captured already by considering two coupled identical maps : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a chaotic map of the unit interval and @xmath5 the coupling constant . for coupling larger than a critical value @xmath0 a transition from a desynchronized state to a completely synchronized one along a chaotic orbit @xmath6",
    "is observed , i.e. @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling @xmath0 can be predicted within a linear analysis as the value of @xmath5 for which the transverse lyapunov exponent ( tle ) @xmath1 , ruling the instabilities transversal to the line @xmath9 , vanishes . for model ( [ eq:2map_1 ] )",
    "@xmath10 @xcite , and consequently @xmath11 being @xmath12 the lyapunov exponent ( le ) of the single ( uncoupled ) map .",
    "while in low dimensional systems the basic mechanisms ruling synchronization , in the absence of strong nonlinear effects , have been well established since long time  @xcite , the studies devoted to synchronization in extended systems are still limited to few specific examples  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "two main frameworks have been considered .",
    "on one hand , the investigation of mutual synchronization between two replicas of a spatially extended system has been pursued for systems coupled either via local interaction @xcite or via spatio - temporal noise @xcite . in both cases , when the amplitude of the coupling ( noise ) overcomes a certain threshold , synchronization is observed : after a transient , the two systems follow the same spatio - temporal chaotic ( stochastic ) orbit .    on the other hand , another commonly observed situation corresponds to self synchronization of elements belonging to the same system .",
    "this occurs for instance in large collections of coupled elements such as populations of neurons @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite or cardiac pacemaker cells @xcite . in these systems",
    "the interaction among the elements can range from nearest neighbors to globally coupled .",
    "therefore , a model able to encompass both these limiting cases is certainly of interest . a good candidate is represented by the following coupled map lattice with power - law interactions  @xcite @xmath13 which reduces to globally coupled maps ( gcm s ) @xcite for @xmath14 , and to standard coupled map lattices ( cml s ) with nearest neighbor coupling @xcite in the limit @xmath15 . in equation ( [ eq : cml ] ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the discrete temporal and spatial indexes , @xmath18 is the lattice size ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 the state variable , @xmath21 $ ] measures the strength of the coupling and @xmath22 its power - law decay .",
    "since the sum extends up to @xmath23 the model is well defined only for odd @xmath18-values , and @xmath24 is a normalization factor .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the synchronization between replicas of the same spatial system has been the subject of a more systematic study than self synchronization and is now rather well understood  @xcite .",
    "two different mechanisms of mutual synchronization have been identified according to the predominance of linear versus nonlinear effects .",
    "nonlinearly dominated transitions are observed when the local dynamics is ruled by a discontinuous ( e.g the bernoulli map ) or `` almost discontinuous '' maps ( e.g. maps possessing very high values of the first derivatives ) . in these cases a linear analysis is no more sufficient to fully characterize the transition , because the instabilities associated with finite amplitude perturbations may desynchronize the system . in both cases",
    "the transition to the synchronized state is typically of the second order .",
    "however , depending on the linear or non - linear nature of the prevailing mechanism two different universality classes characterize the transition itself . for continuous maps ( e.g. logistic maps ) critical exponents",
    "associated with the multiplicative noise ( mn ) universality class are usually found  @xcite , while for ( almost ) discontinuous maps the transition belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) class  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to clarify the effect of strong nonlinearities in the synchronization phenomenon , in particular in the case of self synchronization .    as a first point",
    ", we show that strong nonlinearities may induce nontrivial effects also in low dimensional systems such as two coupled maps . in particular",
    ", we find that even though the critical coupling @xmath0 can be always predicted within the linear framework , the transient dynamics preceding the synchronization can be strongly affected by finite scale instabilities . to properly characterize the latter we introduce a new indicator , the finite size transverse lyapunov exponent ( fstle ) , which generalizes the concept of finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle )  @xcite to the transverse dynamics .",
    "the fstle extends the definition of tle to finite perturbation and is therefore able to discern linearly from nonlinearly dominated transitions .",
    "depending on the behavior of the fstle at finite amplitudes two different class of maps are singled out maps characterized by a decreasing fstle at any finite scale , and _ class ii _ maps that present a peak in the fstle for some finite amplitude value .",
    "moreover , in the proximity of the transition the shape of the probability density function ( pdf ) , @xmath25 , of the synchronization times @xmath26 depends on the dynamics at finite scales and on the multifractal properties of the map . for class",
    "i maps two cases can be identified . for maps , such as the symmetric tent map and the logistic map at the crisis , which are characterized by the vanishing of fluctuations of the finite time le at long times",
    ", the pdf exhibits a fast falloff at large @xmath26 s .",
    "in particular , for the symmetrical tent map we provide an analytical expression for @xmath25 . for maps , such as the skew tent map , exhibiting _",
    "modulational intermittency _ @xcite ( which is related to the persistence of fluctuations of the finite time le also in the long time limit ) , @xmath25 becomes an inverse gaussian distribution @xcite originating by the diffusive motion of the ( logarithm of the ) perturbation in transverse space . for class",
    "ii maps the pdf s display an exponential tail at long times which , differently from the previous case , is due to nonlinear effects .    as far as spatially extended systems are concerned , anteneodo et al .",
    "@xcite have performed a linear stability analysis of model ( [ eq : cml ] ) obtaining analytically the critical coupling @xmath0 for the transition .",
    "this prediction works perfectly for class i maps , as found for the coupled logistic maps  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in the present paper , linear analysis may fail in class ii maps .",
    "in particular , for large system sizes ( @xmath27 ) an exponential divergence of the synchronization times with @xmath18 can be observed even for negative tle , as a result in the limit @xmath28 the transition takes place at a critical coupling @xmath29 .",
    "finite scale instabilities are the key elements for observing this _ nonlinear synchronization transition_. similarly to the case of diffusively coupled map lattices it is possible to link the synchronization transition of cml with power law coupling with non - equilibrium phase transitions . indeed as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite synchronization of replicas of cml with short range coupling belong either to the mn or to the dp universality classes . here",
    "we shall discuss the connection of self synchronization of model ( [ eq : cml ] ) with long range spreading processes  @xcite .",
    "the material is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec:2 ] is devoted to synchronization of two coupled maps . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] coupled maps with power law coupling are examined . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we briefly summarize the reported results .",
    "to analyze the synchronization of two coupled maps ( [ eq:2map_1 ] ) it is useful to introduce the following variables : @xmath30 in terms of which eq .",
    "( [ eq:2map_1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\ w^{t+1 } & = & \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon \\right )   \\left[f(u^t+w^t ) - f(u^t - w^t ) \\right ] \\label{eq : diff}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easily checked that the synchronized solution ( corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) is an admissible solution of ( [ eq : diff ] ) for any value of the coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the stability of such a solution can be studied by considering the linear dynamics of an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath34 of the synchronized state .",
    "this evolves according to the linearized equation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "clearly the stability of the state @xmath32 is controlled by the sign of the transverse ( or conditional ) lyapunov exponent @xmath37 where @xmath12 is the lyapunov exponent of the single map @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , by requiring @xmath38 one obtains the critical coupling @xmath0 ( [ eq : epsc ] ) above which the synchronized state is linearly stable .",
    "notice that for @xmath39 , @xmath1 coincides with the second lyapunov exponent @xmath40 of the coupled system ( [ eq:2map_1 ] ) .",
    "the synchronization transition has been mainly studied for continuous maps , here denoted as _ class i _ maps , in particular for the logistic map @xmath41 at the crisis @xcite and the skew tent map @xcite @xmath42 it should be noticed that inside this class of maps one has to distinguish between two situations according to the behavior of the fluctuations of the finite time lyapunov exponents in the long time limit .",
    "the vanishing of such fluctuations is observed for the symmetric tent map and the logistic one at the crisis , while their persistence characterizes the skew tent map that represents the generic case @xcite .",
    "recent studies however pointed out that discontinuous or `` almost '' discontinuous maps ( i.e. maps with @xmath43 in some point of the definition interval ) , here termed _ class ii _ maps , may give rise to non trivial interesting phenomena .",
    "for instance , the synchronization transition for two replicas of class ii cmls is not driven , as usual , by infinitesimal perturbations , but by the instability ( spreading ) of finite amplitude perturbations @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear synchronization is linked to the so - called _ stable chaos _",
    "@xcite : a phenomenon characterized by information propagation even in the absence of chaos  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we shall show in the following also the self synchronization of a single cml can be strongly affected by nonlinearities .",
    "starting from random initial conditions . from top : bernoulli map with @xmath44 , logistic map at the crisis and the skew tent map with @xmath45 .",
    "for all maps , the coupling has been chosen in order to ensure @xmath46 .",
    "the dashed straight lines display the @xmath47 decay . ]",
    "representative examples of class ii maps are the generalized bernoulli map @xmath48 that is discontinuous and its continuous version @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "as already mentioned , the peculiarity of such maps is that they are not only unstable with respect to infinitesimal perturbations but also to finite ones ( for ( [ eq : bsc ] ) this is true for sufficiently small @xmath53 values ) .",
    "the main differences between synchronization transitions ruled by linear mechanisms with respect to those driven by finite amplitude instabilities can be captured already by considering the evolution of @xmath54 .",
    "the typical behavior of this quantity for @xmath55 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : wt ] for the bernoulli , the logistic and the skew tent map . for the logistic map , apart from ( short time ) fluctuations due to the multiplier variations , an average linear decrease of @xmath56 with slope given by @xmath1 is observed . for the bernoulli map , despite the tle is negative and does not fluctuate in time , @xmath54 exhibits instantaneous jumps to @xmath57 values .",
    "these jumps , which are due to finite amplitude instabilities , are more probable for large @xmath54 amplitudes .",
    "completely analogous behaviors have been found for the map ( [ eq : bsc ] ) , where the multipliers do fluctuate .    as shown in fig.[fig : wt ] for the skew tent map with @xmath58 , @xmath59 displays an intermittent evolution during the transient preceding the synchronization , that is reflected in a diffusive motion of @xmath60 . as a consequence long transients",
    "are observed close to the transition .",
    "this phenomenon , known as _ modulational intermittency _",
    "@xcite is induced by fluctuations of the finite time tle that do not average out in the long time limit and as a consequence can be explained by linear analysis .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we mention that long synchronization transients have been reported also for nonlinearly coupled expanding maps  @xcite . in this model resurgences of @xmath54 during the transient are due to the presence of an invariant chaotic repelling set .",
    "we stress that for class ii maps the transient is absolutely non chaotic i.e. their transverse dynamics in tangent space is contracting at any time .      to quantitatively characterize the different _",
    "transverse_-space dynamics ( i.e. the evolution of @xmath61 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wt ] ) for maps of class i and ii , let us now introduce the finite size transverse lyapunov exponent .",

    "care should , of course , be taken to maintain @xmath71 within the interval of definition of the map . during the evolution",
    "we record the time , @xmath78 , needed for @xmath54 to pass for the first time from one threshold @xmath79 to the following one @xmath80 and also the value of @xmath81 at the moment of the passage .",

    "@xmath86 the fstle converges to @xmath1 .",

    "expects that the synchronization transition has to occur when @xmath239 .",

    "may invalidate the linear criterion to locate the critical coupling . in this case",
    "the transition occurs , due to nonlinear mechanisms , at a larger coupling value .",
    "the nonlinear transition is characterized by the emergence of transients diverging exponentially with the system size even above the linear critical coupling .",
    "the origin of this transition is closely related to the stable chaos phenomenon .",
    "the synchronization phenomena both in linearly and nonlinearly driven systems have been compared with models for long ranged contact processes .",
    "we found that , for linearly driven systems , the transition is continuous and the critical exponents are given by a mean field prediction . for",
    "nonlinearly driven systems , though the results are not conclusive , evidence of a discontinuous transition have been found .",
