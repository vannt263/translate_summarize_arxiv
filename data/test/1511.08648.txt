    "homo and heteroclinic bifurcations constitute the core of our understanding of complicated recurrent behaviour in dynamical systems .",
    "the history goes back to poincar in the late @xmath0 century , with major subsequent contributions by the schools of andronov , shilnikov , smale and palis .",
    "these schools have been founded on a combination of analytical and geometrical tools which developed a quite good understanding of the qualitative behaviour of those dynamics .",
    "differential equations modelling physical experiments frequently have parameters which appear in the differential equations , and it is known that qualitative changes may occur in the solution structure of these systems as the parameters vary .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of systems can be strongly influenced by special geometric or analytic invariant structures appearing in the equations ( _ e.g. _ divergence - free , preserving or reversing symmetries ) .",
    "one may ask which dynamical behaviour we would expect to see in the presence of a given invariant structure .",
    "generically , this is a hard question to answer , but some questions could be partially answered , by considering local and global bifurcations of low codimension .      a bykov cycle on a three - dimensional manifold is a heteroclinic cycle between two hyperbolic saddle - foci of different morse index , where one of the connections is transverse and the other is structurally unstable .",
    "there are two different possibilities for the geometry of the flow around the one - dimensional connection depending on the direction solutions turn around it .",
    "all literature about the michelson system @xcite considered that in the neighbourhoods of the two saddle - foci , trajectories wind in the same direction .",
    "an immediate question arises :    * what happens if trajectories wind with opposite directions near each node ?",
    "the first author and duarte proved in  @xcite that the set of @xmath1-divergence - free vector fields defined in a compact three - dimensional riemannian manifold without boundary , has a @xmath1-residual set such that any vector field inside it is anosov or else , the flow associated to it has dense elliptic solutions in the phase space .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , also in this context , the authors proved that if the vector field is not anosov , then it can be @xmath1-approximated by another divergence - free vector field exhibiting homoclinic tangencies .",
    "however , a conservative vector field whose flow has a persistent bykov cycle may lie outside these residual / dense subsets and the developed theory can not be applied for this degenerated class of systems . since bykov cycles can not be anosov ( due to the presence of equilibria ) , the dichotomies in @xcite suggest the following problem :    * could we perform a @xmath1-perturbation within the set of vector fields whose flow has a bykov cycle in such a way that the elliptic periodic solutions are dense and/or tangencies occur ?    in this paper , we partially answer the questions * ( q1)**(q2)*. we present a mechanism for the coexistence of hyperbolic and non - hyperbolic dynamics arising in a neighbourhood of a conservative bykov cycle where trajectories turn in opposite directions near the two saddle - foci - see figure [ conservativo2 ] . we show that in a @xmath1-open class of divergence - free vector fields , tangencies of the invariant manifolds of two hyperbolic saddle - foci densely occur .",
    "we prove that the global dynamics is persistently dominated by heteroclinic tangencies and by the existence of infinitely many elliptic points coexisting with hyperbolic dynamics arising from @xmath1transversality .",
    "tangencies are strongly connected with the cocoon bifurcations .",
    "we describe an extended version of these bifurcations which can be detected numerically with the _ time delay function",
    "_ introduced by lau @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "we also find the relations between these four dynamical phenomena : chirality , tangencies , generalized cocoon bifurcations and elliptic solutions . in the conservative setting ,",
    "cocoon bifurcations are connected with unfoldings of a hopf - zero singularity , which has been shown to occur in climatological models with seasonal forcing",

    "the set @xmath3 is the open set ( with the induced topology ) in which theorem [ main1 ] is valid .",
    ", height=113 ]      we recall some important results about heteroclinic tangencies for general and conservative systems .",
    "the systematic study of bifurcations of tangencies was started by gavrilov and shilnikov @xcite in the seventies , for the case of two - dimensional dissipative diffeomorphisms .",
    "the authors established that diffeomorphisms with homoclinic tangencies might separate systems with regular and chaotic dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ they belong to the boundary of morse - smale systems and the transition through this boundary corresponds to an @xmath4explosion .    the theorem on the cascade of periodic sinks / sources near a tangency plays an important role ",
    "see newhouse @xcite : in the dissipative case , for any one parameter family that unfolds generically a quadratic homoclinic tangency , there exists a sequence of intervals of values of the parameter such that the corresponding diffeomorphism has sinks / sources .",
    "one of the fundamental results in homoclinic bifurcations was established in newhouse @xcite : the existence of regions of the space of two - dimensional diffeomorphisms where tangencies are dense .",
    "these regions are called _ newhouse regions _ ; the result has been generalized for the multidimensional case by gonchenko @xcite .",
    "dynamics of systems within these regions is complex and rich and , as claimed in @xcite , it is impossible to give the complete description of bifurcations of such systems .",
    "the majority of these results was obtained for the broader case of general systems without any restriction on the preservation of some invariant structure .",
    "they can not be directly applied to volume - preserving and/or reversible systems because they require special considerations .",
    "nevertheless , the main geometric and analytical arguments can be also used for systems with additional structures , having special care . in this direction , important results on the birth of elliptic periodic points in area - preserving maps under bifurcations of tangencies were obtained in @xcite .",
    "see also the paper by lamb and stenkin @xcite about _ mixed dynamics .",
    "_    bifurcations of single - round periodic solutions were studied in @xcite for two - dimensional symplectic maps close to a map having a quadratic homoclinic tangency .",

    "more precisely , in the present paper we have considered divergence - free vector fields whose flows have bykov cycles , we have found heteroclinic tangencies leading to the description of elliptic periodic solutions for the first return map to a cross section defined near the tangency . within a codimension 1 set in @xmath73 ,",
    "tangencies between the invariant manifolds of the two saddle - foci densely occur .    the proof of the existence of elliptic solutions near the horseshoes does not run along the same lines of gonchenko and shilnikov @xcite , in which the authors used renormalisation to the hnon map .",
    "along the proof of our results , we use the topological notion of chirality , making our findings different from those of @xcite .",
    "we asked for the @xmath1 volume - preserving connecting lemma @xcite to perform local perturbations .",
    "similar heteroclinic bifurcations have been considered in @xcite , where generic flat perturbations do not preserve the cycle .",
    "the non - wandering dynamics near the bykov cycle is dominated by hyperbolic horseshoes , conjugate to a full shift over a finite alphabet , that accumulate on the cycle .",
    "hyperbolic behaviour can not be separated from the ellitic behaviour by isotopies .",
    "our underlying hypothesis on the maintenance of the bykov cycle is inspired in the @xmath76-reversible case , with @xmath416 , where the mantainance holds _ per se_.",
    "preserving the bykov cycle is the most important consequence from the anti - symmetry ; this is why we decided to reach general results without the reversibility hypothesis .",
    "the divergence - free character is crucial because it guarantees the stability of elliptic periodic solutions in our three - dimensional context . in",
    "higher dimensional case , the divergence freeness is no longer sufficient and we should consider hamiltonian vector fields in order to get the stability of elliptic periodic solutions .    in the present paper",
    ", we are able to prove the existence of heteroclinic tangencies between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "our findings are richer that those of @xcite in the sense that we can explicitly give the manifolds for which we observe tangency .",
    "note that the works @xcite proved the existence of a @xmath1-dense / residual set inside which tangencies and elliptic solutions occur via a mechanism developed by mora and romero @xcite to create open sets having a dense set of maps with tangencies nearby .",
    "different chirality of the nodes is a new topological concept and has never been studied in the conservative setting .",
    "this topological property has profound effects on the dynamics near the bykov cycle . of course",
    ", in agreement with kaloshin s theorem on the prevalence of kupka - smale systems , these tangencies can not occur for a full lebesgue measure on @xmath2 .",
    "the density of tangencies near the cycle is markedly different from the results about the michelson system proved in @xcite where the tangencies ( near the bykov cycle ) are rare . if @xmath77 , the @xmath76-reversibility prevents different chirality of the nodes .",
    "the context of the proof of theorem [ main1 ] is different from that described in knobloch _",
    "et al _ @xcite using spirals , a work that has been motivated by the michelson system . instead of restricting the flow to the wall of the cylinder ( as we do in theorem [ main1 ] ) ,",
    "their conclusions , like bykov s @xcite , are supported by the study of spirals intersections . in (",
    "* lemmas 6.6 and 6.7 ) it is shown that two logarithmic spirals with a common centre can have at most two tangencies , assuming an irrational ratio of the real part of the complex eigenvalues ",
    "see figure [ spirals](a ) .",
    "although these spirals are only the leading order terms of the bifurcation equations , the density of tangencies can not occur near the cycle , as shown in @xcite . without breaking the fragile connection , assuming the same chirality of the nodes , tangencies may occur but not near the cycle .",
    "bykov implicitly assumed that the chiralities of two nodes are different in formulas ( 3.4),(3.5 ) of @xcite .",
    "indeed , observe the same sign of the exponent of @xmath417 in the formulas that represent the evolution of the angular component of the spirals : @xmath418 where @xmath419 represents the angular coordinates in @xmath162 and @xmath166 and the nonreal eignevalues are given by @xmath420 , @xmath421 . the same happens in formula ( 3.1 ) of bykov @xcite .",
    "after taking logarithms of both sides , from equality ( 3.3 ) on , bykov neglects the assumption about the chiralities of the nodes , assuming that they are different . therefore , in the cross sections , the spirals corresponding to the two - dimensional invariant manifolds of the saddle - foci are oriented in the same way .",
    "this explains the orientation of the spirals of figure 2 of @xcite in contrast to those depicted in figure 11 of @xcite .",
    "these spirals are revived in figure [ spirals ] .",
    "bykov never comments on the chiralities of the nodes , assuming implicitly that they are different .     and",
    "@xmath422 have : case ( a ) : an infinite number of transversal intersections and at most two tangential intersections in total @xcite .",
    "case ( b ) : an infinite number of transversal intersections and , for small perturbations which do not break the fragile connection , an infinite tangential intersections.,height=170 ]      the cocoon bifurcation is a set of rich bifurcation phenomena numerically observed by lau @xcite in the michelson system .",
    "the authors in kokubu _",
    "et al _ @xcite proved the existence of the cocoon bifurcations for the michelson system , which arise as the travelling wave equation of the kuramoto - sivashinky equation and also as a part of the limit family of the unfolding of the three - dimensional nilpotent singularity of codimension 3  see @xcite .",
    "numerical results show that , when a given parameter varies , the system exhibits an infinite sequence of heteroclinic bifurcations due to the tangency of the two - dimensional invariant manifolds of saddle - foci .",
    "each bifurcation creates new transverse heteroclinic connections . in @xcite ,",
    "these bifurcations have been studied from a general point of view ; they have been explained as a consequence of an organizing center called the _",
    "cusp transverse heteroclinic chain_. fixing the fragile connection , the cocoon bifurcations play the same role as the newhouse bifurcations ( generic unfoldings for the homoclinic tangency ) in the dissipative category .",
    "thick cantor sets appear near the tangency , which are @xmath8-persistent , @xmath423 . in the present paper , we prove the existence of cocoon bifurcations within a degenerate set of divergence - free vector fields characterized by different chirality of the nodes .",
    "in contrast to the findings of @xcite , in which the authors could break the cycle , our perturbations have been performed without breaking the fragile connection .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , the reversibility is used to get saddle - nodes with both stable and unstable sets of dimension 1 and the volume - preserving character plays no role .",
    "we may use our results to illustrate the expected behaviour of the simple bifurcations of symmetric periodic solutions , namely saddle - node and period doubling via the creation and annihilation of horseshoes in a similar phenomenon to that described in @xcite .",
    "although we deal with a degenerate class of vector fields , our results hold for any generic unfolding of the cycle .",
    "the greatest difficulty arises when we want to preserve the bykov cycle , a property that emerge in @xmath76-reversible systems with @xmath416 . in a broader way",
    ", our results hold for any kind of cycles having a one - dimensional solution connecting two saddle - foci .",
    "in fact , following the approach in @xcite , it should be possible to show that vector fields containing bykov cycles are always @xmath1-close to another with a tangency ( and even a cocconing cascade of tangencies ) , without making any assumption on the chirality .",
    "nevertheless , there is no guarantee that the cycle is preserved .    although a degenerate class of systems satisfy * ( h1)(h5 ) * , the present work may be seen as the description of a simple and general mechanism to create non - hyperbolic behaviour in a robust fashion near a singular cycle .",
    "since the existence of cycles involving equilibria is not a generic phenomenon , they may exist outside the residual sets given by the classical dichotomies for divergence - free vector fields @xcite .",
    "several questions remain to be solved for this kind of cycles , in particular about the existence and sign of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the lebesgue measure of the points that remain for all time in the neighbourhood of the cycle is an interesting point to be considered . in the spirit of @xcite ,",
    "conservativeness - breaking is a another direction that should be investigated .",
    "a first attempt to understand this phenomenon may be found in dumortier _",
    "et al _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .",
    "the present article should be seen as a starting point for further related studies ; the ergodic characterization of the dynamics near these cycles ( even in the dissipative case ) is still far for being completely understood .",
