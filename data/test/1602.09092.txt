    "in this paper we develop a globally convergent numerical method for a 1-d inverse medium problem in the frequency domain .",
    "the performance of this method is tested on both computationally simulated and experimental data .",
    "propagation of electromagnetic waves is used in experiments . a theorem about the global convergence of our method",
    "is proved .",
    "another name for inverse medium problems is coefficient inverse problems ( cips ) .",
    "we model the process as a 1-d cip due to some specifics of our data collection procedure , see subsection 6.2 .",
    "this paper is the first one in which the globally convergent method of @xcite is extended to the case of the frequency domain .",
    "indeed , the original version of that method works with the laplace transform of the time dependent data .",
    "both the 3-d and the 1-d versions of the method of @xcite were verified on experimental data , see @xcite for the 3-d case and karch , ksnf1,ksnf2 for the 1-d case .",
    "the experimental data here are the same ones as in @xcite .    compared with the previous publications @xcite , two additional difficulties occurring here",
    "are : ( 1 ) we now work with complex valued functions instead of real valued ones and , therefore ( 2 ) it is not immediately clear how to deal with the imaginary part of the logarithm of the complex valued solution of the forward problem . on the other hand , we use that logarithm in our numerical procedure . besides",
    ", the previous numerical scheme of @xcite is significantly modified here .",
    "we call a numerical method for a cip _ globally convergent _ if there is a rigorous guarantee that this method reaches at least one point in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the correct solution without any advanced knowledge about this neighborhood .",
    "it is well known that the topic of the global convergence for cips is a highly challenging one .",
    "thus , similarly with the above cited publications , we prove the global convergence of our method within the framework of a certain approximation . this is why the term approximate global convergence `` was used in above cited references ( global convergence '' in short ) .",
    "that approximation is used only on the first iterative step of our algorithm and it is not used in follow up iterations .",
    "besides , this approximation is a quite natural one , since it amounts to taking into account only the first term of a certain asymptotic behavior and truncating the rest .",
    "the global convergence property is verified numerically here on both computationally simulated and experimental data .",
    "cips are both highly nonlinear and ill - posed .",
    "these two factors cause the non - convexity of conventional tikhonov functionals for these problems .",
    "it is well known that typically those functionals have multiple local minima and ravines , see , e.g. numerical examples of multiple local minima in scales and on figure 5.3 of @xcite .",
    "figure 5.4 of @xcite demonstrates an example of a ravine .",
    "hence , there is no guarantee of the convergence of an optimization method to the correct solution , unless the starting point of iterations is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of that solution .",
    "however , it is often unclear in practical scenarios how to reach that neighborhood .    in our inverse algorithm we solve a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations of the second order on the interval @xmath0 .",
    "the peculiarity here is that we have overdetermined boundary conditions for these equations : we have the solution and its first derivative at @xmath1 and we have the first derivative of the solution at @xmath2 .",
    "our attempts to use only boundary conditions at @xmath1 did not lead to good reconstruction results .",
    "the same observation is in place in remark 5.1 on page 13 of ksnf1 .",
    "thus , similarly with @xcite , we use here the quasi - reversibility method ( qrm ) .",
    "the qrm is well suitable to solve pdes with the overdetermined boundary data . to analyze the convergence rate of the qrm",
    ", we use a carleman estimate .",
    "the qrm was first introduced by lattes and lions @xcite .",
    "however , they have not established convergence rates . these rates were first established in @xcite , where it was shown that carleman estimates are the key tool for that goal .",
    "a survey of applications of carleman estimates to qrm can be found in @xcite .",
    "chapter 6 of @xcite describes the use of the qrm for numerical solutions of cips .",
    "we also mention an active work with the qrm of bourgeois and dard , see , e.g. @xcite for some samples of their publications .",
    "our experimental data are given in the time domain . to obtain the data in the frequency domain",
    ", we apply the fourier transform .",
    "previously the same data were treated in works @xcite of this group . in that case",
    "the laplace transform was applied .",
    "next , the 1-d version of the globally convergent method of @xcite was used .",
    "indeed , the original version of this method works with the laplace transform of the time dependent data .",
    "a similar 1-d inverse problem in the frequency domain was solved numerically in @xcite by a different method .",
    "the experimental data of this publication were collected by the forward looking radar which was built in the us army research laboratory @xcite .",
    "the data were collected in the field ( as opposed to a laboratory ) .",
    "thus , clutter was present at the measurement site .",
    "this certainly adds some additional difficulties to the imaging problem .",
    "the goal of this radar is to detect and identify shallow explosives , such as , e.g. improvised explosive devices and antipersonnel land mines .",
    "those explosives can be located either on the ground surface or a few centimeters below this surface .",
    "this radar provides only a single time dependent curve for a target .",
    "therefore , to solve a cip , we have no choice but to model the 3-d process by a 1-d wave - like pde .",
    "we model targets as inclusions whose dielectric constants are different from the background .    in terms of working with experimental data ,",
    "the goal in this paper is not to image locations of targets , since this is impossible via solving a cip with our data , see subsection 6.2 for details .",
    "in fact , our goal is to image maximal values of dielectric constants of targets .",
    "our targets are 3-d objects , while we use a 1-d model : since we measure only one time resolved curve for a target .",
    "nevertheless , we show below that our calculated dielectric constants are well within tabulated limits @xcite .    of course , an estimate of the dielectric constant is insufficient for the discrimination of explosives from the clutter . on the other hand ,",
    "the radar community mostly relies on the intensity of the radar image .",
    "therefore , we hope that the additional information about values of dielectric constants of targets might lead in the future to designs of algorithms which would better discriminate between explosives and clutter .    in the 3-d case the globally convergent method of @xcite works with the data generated either by a single location of the source or by a single direction of the incident plane wave .",
    "the second globally convergent method for this type of measurements was developed and tested numerically in @xcite .",
    "we also refer to another globally convergent methods for a cips , which is based on the multidimensional version of the gelfand - levitan method .",
    "this version was first developed by kabanikhin kab1 and later by kabanikhin and shishlenin @xcite . unlike bk1,bk2,tbkf1,tbkf2 , the technique of @xcite works with multiple directions of incident plane waves .",
    "in @xcite the performance of the method of @xcite was compared numerically with the performance of the krein equation @xcite for the same experimental data as ones used here .",
    "the krein equation krein is close to the gelfand - levitan equation @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the performance of the krein equation is inferior to the performance of the method of @xcite for these experimental data .",
    "this is because the solution of the krein equation is much more sensitive to the choice of the calibration factor than the solution obtained by the technique of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is necessary to apply that factor to those experimental data to make the range of values of the resulting data comparable with the range of values of computationally simulated data .",
    "in section 2 we pose forward and inverse problems and analyze some of their features . in section 3",
    "we study a 1-d version of the qrm . in section 4",
    "we present our globally convergent method .",
    "in section 5 we prove the global convergence of our method .",
    "in section 6 we present our numerical results for both computationally simulated and experimental data .",
    "it was shown numerically in @xcite that the component of the electric field , which is incident upon a medium , dominates two other components .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the propagation of that component is well governed by a wave - like pde .",
    "furthermore , this finding was confirmed by imaging from experimental data , see chapter 5 of @xcite and tbkf1,tbkf2 .",
    "thus , just as in @xcite , we use a 1-d wave - like pde to model the collection of our experimental data of electromagnetic waves propagation .      let @xmath3 be two positive numbers .",

    "the reason why we have not used a 3-d model , as in , e.g. earlier works of this group on experimental data bk1,tbkf1,tbkf2 , is that we had only one time resolved experimental curve for each of our five targets .",

    "the proof of the convergence of the qrm is based on a carleman estimate .",
    "a significant modification of our technique , as compared with @xcite , is due to two factors .",

    "results of table 1 are close to those obtained in @xcite .",
