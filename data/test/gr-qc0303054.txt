    "it will not be long before the current set of interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo and tama achieve sensitivities at which detections are expected to be possible with a reasonable event rate .",
    "the ground - based interferometric detectors are now starting full - blown  science runs \" and the plans for more sensitive second and even third generation detectors are in the drawing boards .",
    "even lisa , the space - based observatory , seems to be a possibility in a reasonably near future .",
    "this work tries to help in setting the stage for realistic calculations of what now seems to be a very likely occurrence in active galactic nuclei : the capture of compact stellar - sized objects by the supermassive black holes lurking in the center of most galaxies .",
    "this type of events will generate gravitational waves within lisa s planned sensitivity band .",
    "since the captured objects are small compared to the capturing black hole , they can be treated in a first approximation by black hole perturbation theory .",
    "but one thorny problem still remains that has stalled progress in this area .",
    "we can model the waves coming from many kinds of stationary particle orbits around the black hole , but real orbits will not be stationary .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves will back - react on the object making the orbit decay in time .",
    "one of the challenges in this area is to find workable prescriptions for these radiation reaction forces that can be used in numerical simulations that can produce accurate waveforms and energy fluxes for observers at large distances from the hole to be used as templates for the interferometric detectors .",
    "the prescriptions that have been worked out so far involve calculating quite complex integrals along the past light cone of the particle @xcite .",
    "since almost all perturbative treatments of particles around rotating holes are done in the frequency domain , applying these radiation reaction schemes has proved challenging .",
    "frequency domain computations become computationally expensive when one is dealing with realistic non - circular orbits .",
    "we try here to work out a simple case of equatorial circular particle orbits around a rapidly rotating black hole to show how to treat this problem perturbatively in the time domain .",
    "we hope this might help to open the door to the use of the proposed fully relativistic radiation reaction schemes in the calculation of the more complex but interesting problem of modeling the orbital decay and gravitational radiation emission of particles in more general elliptic and/or inclined orbits . up to now",
    ", almost all treatments have been based on the separability of the equation in the frequency domain and calculate the energy and waveforms for the first few @xmath0 multipoles of the spheroidal harmonics expansion once the radial part has been dealt with .    using the frequency domain approach , quite a few detailed simulations of the gravitational waves emitted by a particle in a bound orbit around a black hole have been carried out in recent years .",
    "the first results for radiation emitted by a particle in orbit around a schwarzschild black hole were carried out by detweiler , who pioneered these techniques @xcite . in a series of six papers , poisson and",
    "various collaborators studied in detail the gravitational wave emission to infinity and into the horizon of a particle in circular orbit around a non - rotating hole @xcite .",
    "other groups have been doing extensive work on post - newtonian expansions for various types of particle orbits around kerr holes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "work has been done on eccentric orbits around schwarszchild @xcite , circular orbits slightly inclined away from the equatorial plane of kerr holes @xcite , and particles with spin orbiting kerr holes on equatorial circular orbits @xcite .",

    "we will perform the numerical evolution with the latest version of a code originally developed by laguna and collaborators @xcite to evolve the teukolsky equation in the time domain from a generic initial data slice .",

    "we impose boundary conditions at the edges of the polar computational domain , i.e. at the black hole horizon , at the rotation axis and at the far end of the radial grid .",

    "we impose usual outgoing boundary conditions . since the wave equation has a potential , errors due to reflection from this boundary bounce back into the computational domain .",
    "we deal with this by making the computational domain in the radial direction large enough that any numerical reflections will not make it back to the point where we compute the waveforms and energy flux in the time allotted for the simulation . at the axis of rotation of the black hole",
    "one imposes either the condition @xmath21 or @xmath22 depending on the parity of the field specified by the azimuthal integer @xmath23 .",
    "the initial data we take for the fields is zero . since we are considering the teukolsky equation with a source we are therefore violating the constraints of general relativity on the initial data",
    "this would correspond to the particle `` appearing suddenly '' and therefore generates an artificial burst of radiation . to get more realistic initial data slices",
    ", one could try constructing initial data sets that correctly satisfy the hamiltonian and momentum constraints with prescriptions like that of bowen and york @xcite in the limit in which one black hole is very small , for instance , or modifications of particle limit data sets such as those of lousto and price @xcite .",
    "these prescriptions specify the @xmath24 sets for use in standard adm evolutions . to convert these quantities to the set @xmath25 needed for the teukolsky evolution , one can use the formulae developed in reference @xcite .",
    "we plan to explore the extent of the benefits that this more accurate intial data specification may bring to enhance the orbital simulations in the particle limit case future work .",
    "the next step is to construct the source term for a general geodesic trajectory of the particle moving in the background kerr geometry . to include the effect of radiation reaction one treats it as a slight deviation of the background geodesic orbital motion .    in the time domain teukolsky equation",
    "the main source term is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 + ( \\delta^ * - \\tau^ * + \\beta^ * + 3 \\alpha + 4 \\pi ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times [ ( \\delta + 2 \\gamma + 2 \\mu^*)t_{nm^ * } - ( \\delta^ * - \\tau^ * + 2 \\beta^ * + 2 \\alpha ) t_{nn}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    all the differential operators and newman  penrose coefficients , as well as the choice of kinnersley tetrad vectors follow the notation of @xcite . by choosing their values in boyer - lindquist coordinates and expanding everything we can end up with an explicit but quite complicated form of the source term that is amenable for numerical calculations@xcite .",

    "we treat this by using the approximation in which we substitute the delta function by a very narrow gaussian function ( whose width is only of a few gridpoints ) : @xmath32    one must show that this substitution is adequate by showing convergence of the obtained waveform as @xmath33 , and one must take special care in normalizing the mass correctly as the particle moves in the background kerr spacetime so that integration over the whole gaussian density profile gives a constant mass throughout the whole trajectory and to satisfy @xmath34 .",
    "this translates in that the gaussian must approximately integrates to one on the spatial manifold . to achieve this with the correct three - metric of the background black hole spacetime ,",
    "we normalize the mass - density of the particle by the factor , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the 3-metric of flat space and @xmath37 is the 3-metric of a slice of constant boyer - lindquist time of the kerr spacetime .",
    "we then normalize the particle mass as it moves thru the space by multiplying the quantity @xmath38 in the source term expression by this factor @xmath39 .",
    "we handle the dirac deltas in the radial and angular direction through the gaussian approximation , whereas the @xmath40 function we handled analytically .",
    "the normalizations presented are common in the sph literature @xcite .",
    "we now want to calculate the energy flux emitted in the form of gravitational waves from the binary that an orbiting observatory such as lisa would be able to detect . in this paper",
    "we focus on calculating fluxes from circular equatorial orbits without the effects of radiation reaction mainly to test the viability of this approach and to show stability , convergence , and agreement with previous results of high accuracy frequency domain calculations@xcite . in the next section",
    "we will explain the advantages of working in the time domain for future calculations of eccentric and inclined particle orbits .",

[ cfigure ]    we made standard convergence tests by assuming that the numerical values included errors that decrease as a power of the grid spacing @xmath42 .",
    "specifically we assume that the value of the teukolsky function @xmath43 at any point in the computational domain goes like @xmath44 grids typically used in this work are @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , if we run at various resolutions ( l : 2000x20 , m : 4000x40 , h : 8000x80 ) we can get a quantity @xmath49 that measures the order of convergence _ a _ of the code .",
    "this is defined as , @xmath50 and results for it are depicted in figure 1 where we see second order convergence of the evolution code .",
    "we also verified that the results are independent of the gaussian width @xmath51 for both the radial and angular gaussian distributions used to approximate the location of the particle in the discrete spatial grid ( see figure 5 ) .    since equatorial orbits have been treated with great precision in the frequency domain method , it is important to show that our method gives comparable results if one looks at quantities like the average gravitational energy flux at large distances from the horizon .",
    "finn and thorne @xcite published a comprehensive work that tabulates and includes all previous results for high - precision gravitational wave flux and wave amplitudes coming from many kinds of representative compact objects in equatorial circular orbits around massive central black holes . in table",

    "we have shown that it is possible to integrate the teukolsky equation in the time domain for the problem of a particle orbiting around a black hole with the particle was represented as a gaussian and obtain results reasonably close to those of the frequency - domain calculations .",
    "the time domain approach is expected to become more useful for the case of more complicated orbits .",

    "finn results need to be further investigated to define well a `` window of reliability '' for the results of the code .",
    "another element to be incorporated is to take into account the radiation flux falling into the black hole , since this will also influence trajectories corrected by radiation - reaction .",
