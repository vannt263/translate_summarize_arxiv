    "while the extremely low oxygen abundance of ddo68 makes it an interesting system , its other physical characteristics make it a critical testbed for our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "specifically , ddo68 is an outlier on the mass - metallicity ( m - z ) relationship @xcite ; it is overly massive compared to the other known systems with comparable metallicity .",
    "the hi mass of ddo68 is four times larger than that of izw18 @xcite and 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of leop @xcite .",
    "the deviation of ddo68 from the m - z relation is so pronounced that it has been excluded from recent works attempting to calibrate this relationship at the lowest abundances @xcite .",
    "[ figcap1 ]    the presence of an extremely metal - poor ism in a massive dwarf galaxy poses a serious obstacle for models of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "one possible origin for these enigmatic properties is the infall of pristine gas .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the infall of primordial gas may produce lower metallicities and lower effective chemical yields .",
    "based on multiple lines of evidence , this scenario may be at work in ddo68 . as the archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) image in figure  [ figcap1](a ) shows , the stellar morphology of ddo68 is severely disturbed ; an elongated stream of stars extends southward over an arcminute ( @xmath153.7 kpc ) from the main stellar body .",
    "this stream is especially prominent in the galex images shown in figure  [ figcap2 ] .",
    "the continuum - subtracted hst h@xmath16 image shown in figure  [ figcap1](b ) reveals widespread massive star formation ( sf ) in ddo68 .",
    "curiously , most of this nebular emission is concentrated in four sf complexes in the north of the galaxy , and in one complex in the stellar stream to the south ; each of these hii regions is co - spatial with high column density hi gas ( n@xmath2 @xmath15 2@xmath410@xmath17 @xmath18 , or @xmath19@xmath2 @xmath15 16 m@xmath1pc@xmath20 ) that is significantly displaced from the center of the main stellar component of ddo68 . in agreement with the previous studies of the hi morphology and dynamics of ddo68 by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we find that the hi morphology of ddo68 is significantly disturbed . further , we have discovered a previously unknown , gas - bearing companion system that is connected to ddo68 by a bridge of low surface brightness hi gas . taken together ,",
    "these lines of evidence suggest that ddo68 is undergoing an interaction or accretion event ; this may support the infall hypothesis .",

    "this improved fitting method delivers superior baseline fits compared to a more simplistic low - order polynomial fit to line - free spectral regions .",
    "calibrated spectra were exported to aips for imaging .",
    "all spectra were combined into a single database and imaged using the sdgrd task with a spherical bessel function @xcite ; the final , smoothed velocity resolution was 15.46 kms@xmath8ch@xmath8 .",

    "most recently , @xcite use the same hst data as analyzed here to derive a distance of 12.3@xmath130.3 mpc ; they also interpret the color - magnitude diagram and stellar population distributions as evidence for an ongoing merger , and identify an interacting companion galaxy ( `` ddo68b '' ) that makes up the bulk of the stellar stellar stream seen in the hst and galex images .",
    "in figure  [ figcap2 ] we present the hi surface density image and the intensity weighted hi velocity field of the ddo68 system .",
    "the hi morphology of ddo68 is significantly disturbed : the hi surface density contours are compressed on the eastern side of the galaxy , but are diffuse and filamentary to the south and west .",

    ". however , significant irregularities in the disk are apparent ( note the kinks in the isovelocity contours in the velocity range 490 - 520 kms@xmath8 ) .",
    "we thus only estimate the bulk kinematics via tilted ring analysis , and defer a full mass decomposition until a later work . using the gipsy task rotcur , we derived a representative rotation curve with the following dynamical parameters : v@xmath12 @xmath3 505.5 kms@xmath8 , major axis position angle ( measured counterclockwise from north toward the receding side of the disk ) @xmath3 19.6 , inclination @xmath23 @xmath3 65.2 .",
