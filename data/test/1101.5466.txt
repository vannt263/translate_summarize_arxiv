    "recently , several groups have addressed the effects which a circularly polarized electromagnetic field ( cpef)@xcite , spin - orbit interaction ( soi)@xcite in suspended graphene or the sub - lattice symmetry breaking ( ssb ) by an underlying polar substrate@xcite in epitaxial graphene may have on the energy band structure of a graphene sheet . in all cases",
    ", a gap is opened between the valence and conduction bands as well as between the intra - band and inter - band electron - hole excitation continuum of the otherwise semi - metal dirac system@xcite . as a matter of fact , the interplay between the single - particle excitations in the long wavelength limit results in dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction which produces an undamped plasmon mode that appears in the gap separating the two types of electron - hole modes forming a continuum . by this",
    "we mean that a self - sustained collective plasma mode is not supported by exciting _ either _ the intra - band or inter - band single - particle modes only . furthermore , although the dirac electrons near the @xmath2-points now acquire a non - zero effective mass , one still can not produce a long wavelength plasmon mode as in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by intra - band excitations for intrinsic graphene .",
    "plasmon excitations in semi - metallic graphene were studied extensively theoretically in single and multilayer graphene .",
    "however , their experimental observations are limited so far to either inelastic scattering of highly energetic particles ( faster than @xmath3 ) or indirect observation through plasmoritons ( a quasiparticle formed by resonant coupling of renormalized hole states with the plasmons ) .",
    "plasmons in graphene gapped by soi or by a polar substrate have been investigated by wang and chakraborty@xcite as well as pyatkovskiy@xcite . because the soi is small ( @xmath4 mev ) , its effect on dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction requires either high resolution spectroscopy or low electron density in the conduction band to be observed .",
    "the effect of soi on the plasmon excitations in a 2deg were also studied by several authors@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gap between the valence and conduction bands near the fermi level when circularly polarized light is applied to graphene could be manipulated , unlike the intrinsic gap due to soi , depending on the intensity and frequency of the light . for a co@xmath5 laser with a 70 w output power and wavelength of 10 @xmath6 ,",
    "the energy gap is about 100 mev , compared with 0.08 mev induced by soi@xcite .",
    "the exact gap opening mechanism in epitaxial graphene is still under debate@xcite .",
    "the problem is rather technical and arises from the fact that the graphene sample sits on top of a buffer layer which provides an additional mid gap level , thus obscuring the exact energy dispersion curve and requires numerical _ ab initio _ calculations@xcite .",
    "this ambiguity stimulated discussion regarding the symmetry breaking gap@xcite versus the effects due to electron - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "this also not only indicates the importance of theoretical investigation of plasmon in gapped graphene , but also an alternative means of providing the gap . since soi is too weak to observe its effect , dressing of the dirac electrons with cpef",
    "is seems to be an alternative worthy of further investigation .",
    "the value of this dynamic energy gap is comparable with that induced by a polar substrate , but contrary to the latter , it is highly adjustable . as a matter of fact , those two gap - opening mechanisms may even work conjunctively .",
    "in that case , the circular polarization of the electromagnetic field may no longer be required provided that it is tuned to be in resonance with the ssb gap .",
    "a possible experiment to measure the plasmon frequencies in single and double layer graphene could employ electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels)@xcite , as shown schematically in fig.[fig:0 ] .",
    "essentially , this would be a pump - probe , with the electron beam being the probe effected by the polarized light whose role is to open the gap .",
    "the raman shift of the scattered electrons provides both particle - hole and plasmon excitation frequencies , which are usually characterized by their spectral weight , a quantity that depends on the transferred energy @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model hamiltonian for dressed dirac electrons by a cpef as well as corresponding energy eigenvalues and wave - functions .",
    "these results are then used for calculating the polarization function and plasmon dispersion relation in the rpa .",
    "our numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "iii but , for convenience , we briefly summarize the highlights of our calculations . for a single graphene layer , in the presence of cpef , we calculate analytically the real and imaginary parts of the noninteracting polarization function , whose imaginary part provides the particle - hole spectral weight . as a piecewise continuous function , it is expressed in terms of region functions which provide a convenient way for determining the landau damping of the plasmon excitations . by increasing the intensity of cpef ,",
    "the dirac electrons become more dressed by photons , providing them with a larger and larger effective mass .",
    "regions in @xmath9 space , which are non - existent for conventional dirac electrons , emerge thereby making the plasmon behavior to resemble that of conventional 2deg .",
    "however , the resemblance is limited , and we show there is no complete crossover to 2deg behavior . the behavior of the plasmons is definitely determined by the presence of the dirac cone @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fermi velocity .",
    "this indicates that although the dressed electron plasma is massive , it still has dirac origin .",
    "we also investigate graphene double layers subjected to a cpef with two plasmon branches given as resonances of the real part of the inverse dielectric function .",
    "two cases are investigated : the symmetric configuration when both layers are gapped and the asymmetric case when the gap is induced on one of the layers .",
    "the latter case may be obtained by compensating cpef with the ssb on the given layer .",
    "the main derived effect on the acoustic plasmon branch is that this mode shows a gain for the symmetric case , but a loss for the asymmetric case .",
    "this applies for a sufficiently intense laser field , over a restricted range of frequency and wavelength@xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we offer some remarks concerning experimental observation of the plasma excitations .",
    "let us consider several graphene layers separated by distance @xmath12 .",
    "one of the layers may be epitaxially grown on a sic substrate .",
    "the structure is optically pumped by an idealized single mode cpef characterized by an associated energy @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average number of photons in the optical field .",
    "it is assumed to be a function of the external pump intensity .",
    "we also take it that all graphene layers are in the node of the optical field and we can neglect retardation effects .",
    "this is valid provided that @xmath15 .",
    "the objective is to find the plasmon dispersion branches @xmath16 for double layer graphene .",
    "those are given by the poles of the inverse dielectric function .",
    "a single layer may be described by the same formalism by setting the inter - layer distance to infinity . by setting the origin",
    "@xmath17 at one of the layers , we may follow the procedure presented in ref.@xcite to obtain the inverse dielectric function as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the dirac delta function and polarization matrix is    @xmath20    it is expressed in terms of the generalized dielectric function    @xmath21+\\left [ \\left ( 1 - e^{-2qd } \\right)v_c(q)\\pi^{(0)}_{11 } \\pi^{(0)}_{22 }   \\right ] \\right \\ } \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the average background dielectric constant .",
    "the plasmon resonances correspond to the poles of the inverse dielectric function which are given by the solutions of @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , the plasmon frequency incorporates its a relaxation rate so that @xmath26 . also , @xmath27 is the noninteracting polarization function for the @xmath28 graphene layer .",
    "the inter - layer polarization function @xmath29 is not included in our formalism due to negligible interlayer tunneling .",
    "the key ingredient of the above equations is the polarization function .",
    "this requires specifics from the model given by the hamiltonian at the two inequivalent @xmath30 points in the graphene dispersion : @xmath31 here , the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian is described by the interaction third term governed by the amplitude of the electric filed @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the quantization volume of the cpef .",
    "the energy of an electron in rotational motion induced by the field is denoted as @xmath34 and assumed to be much smaller than the energy of the optical filed itself , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the second term in [ eq : jamescumminshamiltonian ] takes account of the breaking of the inversion symmetry between @xmath36 and @xmath37 sub - lattices .",
    "also , @xmath38 stands for the difference in on - site energies for the sub - lattices .",
    "it may be induced if the graphene is grown epitaxially on a substrate , and may acquire values as large as @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , see , for instance , zhou et al.@xcite and references therein . on the smaller scale ( @xmath41 ) the symmetry breaking term accounts for spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the dirac part of the hamiltonian is given by [ eq : dirachamiltonian ] , with @xmath42 standing for @xmath30 points correspondingly .",
    "the operators involved in the above hamiltonian are acting in the joined electro / photon space via the following relations :    @xmath43    with @xmath44 denoting the dirac pseudo - spin basis .",
    "the jaynes - cummings part can be readily diagonalized by switching to the dressed electron basis    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and the detuning between the microcavity and the symmetry breaking induced gap is denoted by @xmath47 . in the new basis , the hamiltonian [ eq : hamiltonian ] within the small dressing regime @xmath48 assumes the following form    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the energy gap between valence and conduction bands .",
    "the gap governs the nature of dressed dirac electrons metal - insulator transition@xcite .",
    "one may obtain the solution of the above equation in a straightforward way , giving    @xmath51    it is now a simple matter to show that conventional dirac fermions correspond to the off - resonance limit of the dressed states .",
    "given the dressed states , the noninteracting polarization assumes the lindhard form    @xmath52    the two terms in [ eq : netpolarization ] stand for the inter- and intra - band polarizations , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath6 is the chemical potential whose zero value is in the middle of the gap ( @xmath0 ) . in calculating the polarization",
    ", we assumed that for chosen @xmath14 , each point on the dispersion curve @xmath53 might be occupied by no more than one electron .",
    "this assumption is valid for small energy gap .",
    "otherwise , the quasi - equilibrium density matrix acquires non vanishing off - diagonal elements thus substantially complicating the statistical properties of the dressed states .",
    "the noninteracting polarization [ eq : netpolarization ] in gaped graphene has already been calculated on both the real and imaginary frequency axes@xcite which essentially yield the same result .",
    "since it plays a crucial role in this paper , we give its full form along the real frequency axis as    @xmath54\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    here , the following notations for the region functions have been introduced :    @xmath55    and the regions are shown in fig .  [ fig:6 ] and are defined as    @xmath56    for the purposes of optical spectroscopy , it is advisable to study the long wavelength limit by expanding the polarization function in [ eq : polarization ] in powers of @xmath57 . for small @xmath58 ,",
    "the undamped plasmons exist in the spectral regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 . by expanding the polarization up to the fourth order in @xmath57 ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath61   + o(\\frac{q^4}{\\omega^4 } ) ; & 1_>,5_>,4 _ < ;",
    "\\\\   -\\frac{16 \\hbar \\mu \\omega^3}{v^2_f q^2 } -",

    "the dominant excitations are of the particle - hole type , due to nonzero imaginary part of the polarization . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "the plasmon frequency for a single graphene layer in the vacuum is obtained by solving for the zeros of @xmath66 in [ eq : determinantsingle ] , along with @xmath67 given by [ eq : polarizationoversimplified ] and @xmath68 set to zero , yielding    @xmath69    where we introduced the plasmon region function    @xmath70    in the above expression we used @xmath71 it is also straightforward to show that the region function disappears in the region @xmath72 , thus supporting landau damped plasmons in the region @xmath73 only .",
    "we also note that for conventional graphene and the 2deg , the plasmon region function [ eq : plasmonregionfunction ] is replaced by constants @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .    for the symmetric double layer configuration , one obtains two undamped and two landau damped plasmon branches",
    "whose frequencies in the long wavelength limit obey    @xmath76    where @xmath42 stands for the bonding / anti - bonding plasmon modes , when the polarizations in the two layers work together / against each other in producing the charge density oscillations .",
    "two independent parameters are @xmath77 and @xmath0 . that is",
    "the interplay between the inter - layer distance and the plasmon region function determines the plasmon branches . in the limit of large inter - layer separation , @xmath78 ,",
    "both branches are reduced to [ eq : plasmonregionfunction ] .",
    "conventionally@xcite , those regimes are referred to as intermediate and weak coupling limits .",
    "we avoid using these terms so as not to confuse with the light - matter coupling . on the other hand , for small inter - layer separations , @xmath79",
    ", we have    @xmath80    due to linear dependence of the undamped plasmon frequency on the wave vector @xmath57 , the anti - bonding mode is often referred to as acoustical branch .",
    "the other undamped plasmon branch has larger frequency and is named the optical branch .",
    "to the leading order in @xmath57 , this branch is independent of inter - layer separation and is completely determined by the plasmon region function .",
    "it is always higher in frequency than the acoustical branch and usually ( but not always ) experiences landau damping in the long wavelength limit .    the asymmetric case is also easily obtained in the long wavelength limit , i.e. ,    @xmath81    where we have introduced the short hand notation @xmath82 , with @xmath83 denoting the gap induced on the first ( second ) graphene layer . in the small inter - layer separation limit ,",
    "these eigenfrequencies become    @xmath84    when one moves away from the long wavelength limit , @xmath85 from [ eq : determinantsingle ] in conjunction with become nonlinear , with no closed - form analytic solutions . consequently ,",
    "numerical simulations are needed .",
    "our numerical results are the subject of the next section .",
    "in our numerical calculations , we scaled energies in units of the chemical potential @xmath6 and the wave number in units of the fermi wave number @xmath86 .",
    "the frequency of the electromagnetic field along with its intensity determines the energy gap @xmath0 between the valence and conduction bands .",
    "consequently , this is the only parameter we use to specify the role played by the external laser pump field .",
    "all our calculations for the collective plasma excitations were carried out at @xmath87 .",
    "we begin this section by considering the plasmon dispersion for conventional dirac electrons in graphene obtained by solving @xmath88 with the use of [ eq : determinantsingle ] .",
    "our results are presented in [ fig:1](a.1 ) and are superimposed onto the particle - hole modes by plotting @xmath89 .",
    "this is done in order to identify the regions where there is landau damping .",
    "clearly , the zeros of [ eq : determinantsingle ] yield both damped and undamped plasmon excitations . in order to isolate the undamped modes ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the plasmon spectral weight @xmath90 , where @xmath91 . the plasmon relaxation rate is determined self - consistently , starting with the phenomenological rate whose value hereafter is chosen as @xmath92 . if not for the finite relaxation rate , the plasmon spectral weight is nonzero only in the particle - hole regions@xcite .",
    "below , we show that this condition applies only for the single layer configuration .",
    "the concept is demonstrated in [ fig:1](b.1 ) .",
    "the naturally damped plasmon branch in the @xmath59 triangular region becomes strongly landau damped once it enters the particle - hole mode region @xmath93 .    by dressing dirac electrons with circularly polarized photons ,",
    "they acquire an effective mass and a gap @xmath0 is opened between the valence and conduction bands .",
    "the gap is determined by the intensity and frequency of the laser field .",
    "the presence of @xmath0 in turn induces a gap in the particle - hole mode region for @xmath94 .",
    "the particle - hole free region @xmath60 widens with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "its contribution to the plasmon region function also grows , as indicated by the second term in [ eq : plasmonregionfunction ] .",
    "meanwhile , the dirac contribution of the plasmon region function is decreased through the first term in the same equation .",
    "schematically , the opening of the plasmon window by the electron dressing is shown in [ fig:6 ] .",
    "there is one more region in the particle - hole continuum which gets opened by the energy gap @xmath0 , namely region @xmath95 .",
    "we give it special attention since this region provides the main difference between dressed dirac electrons and conventional graphene . in the latter case ,",
    "this region simply merges with @xmath60 , since the @xmath1 line has no physical meaning .",
    "however , in gapped graphene , this region is very special due to the possible natural plasmon gain existing in it .",
    "indeed , according to [ eq : polarization ] , the polarization acquires an imaginary part provided analytical continuation @xmath96 from the real axis into the lower complex half - plane @xmath97 .",
    "the imaginary part of the polarization becomes a weighted delta function , centered at the plasma frequency @xmath98 .    in the region",
    "@xmath60 the plasmon weight is the conventional positive one given by @xmath99 , with @xmath100 .",
    "this behaviour can be seen on the lower insets of [ fig:1 ] ( a.3 ) .",
    "however , when the plasmon branch enters the region @xmath101 the plasmon weight may flip its sign @xmath102 , since @xmath103 as indicated on the upper inset of [ fig:1](a.3 ) .",
    "interestingly enough the change in sign of the plasmon weight requires the plasmon branch to cross @xmath1 line . on one hand",
    ", the gapeless graphene does not show the crossover from the plasmon loss to the gain since the above condition is never satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is to increase energy gap ( @xmath104 ) so that the plasmon branch is completely forced into the @xmath95 region , then the plasmons also show only the loss and the positive plasmon weight @xmath105 . for even larger energy gap ,",
    "the plasmons are forced into region @xmath73 and become fully landau damped .",
    "the plasmon dispersion for a single layer of gapped graphene is presented in [ fig:1](a.2 ) , ( a.3 ) .",
    "numerical results shown in [ fig:1](b.2 ) , ( b.3 ) demonstrate the predominant plasmon gain for short wavelengths . in the long wave length limit the plasmon branches are always well behaved .",
    "therefore , at this level of theory , it is impossible to say if the anomalous plasmon behaviors has some physical meaning or being just an indicator of rpa failure at larger @xmath57 .",
    "turning now to the double layer configuration , we present in [ fig:2 ] through [ fig:5 ] the plasmon dispersion and damping for the symmetric and asymmetric cases . in these plots , the panels",
    "( a.1 , a.2 , a.3 , a.4 ) correspond to zero energy gap for chosen inter - layer separation . in the presence of an energy gap",
    ", we note that one of the plasmon modes ( the acoustic branch @xmath106 ) may be forced into region @xmath95 for values of @xmath107 as small as one ( see [ fig:2,fig:3](b.1 , c.1 ) ) . as far as the symmetric configuration is concerned",
    ", this mode demonstrates _ gain _ , while the asymmetric case shows losses in that region as may be deduced from its spectral weight in [ fig:4,fig:5 ] ( b.1 , c.1 ) .",
    "for the symmetric double layer , there are two landau damped plasmon modes in the region @xmath73 .",
    "one of them runs just along @xmath108 interface . while the other starts along @xmath109 interface and then eventually merges with the first branch at short wavelength , as demonstrated in [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the frequencies of these plasmon branches are almost independent of the inter - layer separation @xmath12 .",
    "the asymmetric configuration in effect causes one of these damped modes to become purely acoustic with frequency @xmath110 over a wide range of wave vector @xmath57 , as shown in [ fig:3 ] .",
    "let us now confine our attention to the plasmon branches whose frequencies in the long wavelength limit coincide with those of the bonding ( @xmath111 ) and antibonding ( @xmath106 ) modes . for large inter - layer distance satisfying @xmath112 , in the absence of an energy gap , @xmath113 ,",
    "these modes converge onto the line @xmath114 . by increasing the gap for the symmetric double layer ,",
    "there emerge landau damped plasmon branches in regions @xmath115 from the bonding mode , as shown in [ fig:2](b , c ) .",
    "the remaining part of the @xmath111 branch is almost independent of @xmath12 .",
    "this part of the excitation branch mimics the single layer plasmon subjected to @xmath0 ( symmetric configuration , [ fig:2](b.4 , c.4 ) ) or gap independent ( asymmetric case , [ fig:3 ] ( b.4,c.4 ) ) .",
    "the latter case is of special interest since it obeys the conventional plasmon dispersion law for graphene while seemingly progressing into the gap within the particle - hole mode region .",
    "however , its spectral weight as seen in [ fig:5 ] demonstrates strong landau - like damping once it enters region @xmath116 .    by bringing the layers close to each other",
    ", @xmath106 becomes acoustic like ( see [ eq : dlacoustical ] ) , and , for small inter - layer distance , may be mostly accommodated by region @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath111 mode is similar to that for the single layer .",
    "that is , @xmath117 for the symmetrical case [ eq : dlacoustical ] , and is gap independent in the asymmetrical case with @xmath118 .",
    "theoretical results reported here were carefully presented to stimulate experimental verification for both the single and double layer configuration .",
