    "low resolution measurements made during the 1970s and early 1980s showed circular polarization ( cp ) to be only a very small fraction of the integrated synchrotron emission from extra - galactic radio jets . in reviewing high accuracy measurements from this era , found no reliable measurements of cp greater than @xmath1% and considered @xmath2% to be strongly polarized .",
    "computational jet models by showed that _ local _ levels of circular polarization could exceed @xmath1% and that cp was strongest deep in the jet near the optically thick core where @xmath3 .",
    "jones also found that faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization was the dominant process for producing cp in his simulated jets . in",
    "the concluding remarks to his 1988 paper , jones emphasized the importance of high resolution studies of cp using the national radio astronomy observatory s planned very long baseline array ( vlba ) .    in principle ,",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) studies of circular polarization allow us to see where circular polarization arises in a jet , thereby allowing us to find its local fractional level , measure its spectrum , and combine this data with local values for the linear polarization , faraday rotation , and optical depth .",
    "our initial detections of circular polarization with the vlba were in the radio galaxy , 3c84 , and the high powered quasar , 3c279 @xcite . in the case of 3c279",
    "we were able to measure a number of the constraints listed above and concluded the cp resulted from the faraday conversion process , implying a low cutoff in the particle energy distribution ( @xmath4 ) and therefore suggesting a predominantly @xmath5 plasma for the jet on kinetic luminosity grounds @xcite .",
    "recent radiative transfer simulations by and ( see also their contributions to these proceedings ) , suggest that our derived cutoff in the particle energy distribution may not be a strict upper limit , relaxing the need for an @xmath5 plasma .",
    "ultimately , our ability to extract physical insights about the nature of jets from cp observations depends on our ability to determine the dominant mechanism for circular polarization production . in",
    ", we reviewed a number of mechanisms for producing net circular polarization in radio jets and discussed some of the difficulties in interpreting circular polarization observations .",
    "on theoretical grounds , e.g. , the faraday conversion process should dominate any contribution from the intrinsic cp of synchrotron radiation ; however , only in the case of 3c279 @xcite is there supporting observational evidence that faraday conversion is indeed the dominant process . the spectral evidence from other objects",
    "presents a confusing picture which could be consistent with either intrinsic cp or faraday conversion @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in finding a clear observational signature of faraday conversion ( or of intrinsic cp for that matter ) may be due in part to the confusion from other parts of the jet in these integrated measurements ; however , even in the case of the intra - day variable source pks 1519@xmath0273 @xcite , where interstellar scintillation gives an effective resolution of tens of micro - arcseconds , the observed spectrum does not clearly reveal the mechanism . a significant confounding factor , both in these intra - day variable observations and in our high resolution vlba observations , is the likely coincidence of a circularly polarized signal with the inhomogeneous radio core .",
    "as discussed in , depending on the assumptions one wishes to make , an inhomogeneous radio core can have a wide range of spectral index values for circular polarization , irrespective of production mechanism .    in this article",
    "we discuss the study of circular polarization in jets using vlbi . in section [",
    "s : review ] we briefly review some key results and issues from our earlier works . in section [ s : new ] we present new , multi - frequency vlba images on two quasars : pks 0607@xmath0157 and 3c345 , and we evaluate the extent to which our interpretation of these results is confounded by the inhomogeneous cores in which the circular polarization is detected . finally , we conclude by discussing goals and prospects for future circular polarization studies with the vlba .",
    "our circular polarization observations for the jet of 3c279 ( discussed above ) were part of a multi - epoch vlba monitoring campaign to study rapid changes in total intensity and polarization of the most highly active blazars .",
    "the program spanned 6 epochs during 1996 with observations at approximately 2 month intervals .",
    "five of these epochs were suitable for circular polarization detection at 15 ghz , and these epochs were re - analyzed to search for circular polarization , yielding our results on 3c279 as well as multi - epoch detections on 3c84 , pks 0528@xmath6134 , and 3c273 .",
    "all of these results , as well as a detailed discussion of our techniques were presented in .    from this study",
    ", we learned that _",
    "local _ levels of circular polarization could be quite strong in the jets , and we detected fractional cp ranging from @xmath7% . in the case of 3c273 , the appearance of cp in the jet core coincided with the appearance of small amounts of linear polarization ( @xmath8% ) and a change in opacity in the core from very opaque to more optically thin as a new jet component began to emerge . in our final epoch , the circular polarization spanned the core region of 3c273 but appeared most strongly associated with the newly emerging component .",
    "interestingly , the sign of the circular polarization remained consistent in each source across all of our epochs ; three of these sources were undergoing strong core outbursts at this time which varied their total intensity and linear polarization . to us , this suggested a magnetic field structure , responsible for setting the sign of the circular polarization , which is persistent on a timescales at least as long as an individual outburst event .",
    "in we presented results of 5 ghz vlba circular polarization observations of 40 sources .",
    "of these sources , we detected circular polarization in 11 objects at levels of @xmath9% local fractional circular polarization .",
    "our results were very similar to the integrated measurements of who studied a different sample of objects at 5 ghz with the australian compact telescope array ( atca ) .",
    "other than a strong tendency for levels of linear polarization to exceed circular , both studies found apparently no relation between observed linear and circular polarization in either the integrated @xcite or parsec - scale core @xcite measurements .",
    "one might naturally expect a correlation between linear and circular polarization as both intrinsic circular polarization and faraday conversion require high degrees of field order to produce net cp .",
    "faraday conversion , in particular , is expected to have a strong relationship with linear polarization as it is the linear polarization that is converted to circular @xcite .",
    "of course , it is possible to destroy any correlation between linear and circular polarization through either some kind of faraday depolarization or by simply having the circular polarization produced in a region much smaller than even our vlbi beam",
    ".      found that , despite reasonably large fractional variability in circularly polarized flux , changes in sign of the cp for a particular source were rare . over their @xmath10 year observing window , only 2 out of 14 variable cp detected sources showed clear changes in the sign of their circular polarization .",
    "as described above , our vlba results presented in also show sign consistency over a shorter observing window when three of our four detected objects were undergoing large internal changes resulting from developing outbursts . in",
    ", we investigated this issue further by comparing all recently reported cp measurements to those made @xmath11 years ago .",
    "we found that 5 out of 6 sources that were detected both today and in the past had the same sign of circular polarization .",
    "while the statistics were only suggestive , we postulated the existence of a long timescale , persistent magnetic field structure , perhaps tied to the black hole / accretion disk system , which sets the sign of circular polarization in a particular source @xcite .",
    "results presented at this meeting have cast some doubt on this idea of long timescale cp sign consistency as a general property of circularly polarized sources ( e.g. h. aller , these proceedings ) .",
    "two of three of our recently reduced vlba results also show opposite signs of cp from those detected historically ( homan and wardle , in prep ) . upon reflection , we believe there are serious flaws in our comparison of cp signs from recent results to the historical record as compiled by and .",
    "frequency of observation is often different between the historical and recent results . in the case of 3c84 ,",
    "a predominantly positive sign for the circular polarization at 15 ghz did not match the historically detected negative cp at 5 ghz and below ; however , our recent vlba results on 3c84 ( in prep ) show , in addition to positive cp at 15 ghz and 22 ghz , clear evidence for predominantly negative cp at 5 ghz .",
    "an additional concern is the use of what are often single epoch detections to infer the `` preferred sign '' of cp today for comparison to historical measurements .",
    "perhaps the best evidence for long term sign consistency in cp is for sgr a * where used archive observations to show that the circular polarization maintained the same sign over 18 years    given that stochastic effects may play a significant role in cp production in at least some sources , the best approach may be long term , frequent monitoring campaigns to establish the extent to which individual sources have a preferred sign of cp and on what timescale this preferred sign persists .",
    "this issue touches upon the connection between the bh / accretion disk system and the magnetic field structures observed in jets .",
    "ultimately we would like to know if the bh / accretion disk imprints a signature in the circular polarization we observe from jets .",
    "if such a signature exists , does it change with jet radius ( perhaps indicating a reduction in magnetic flux or a change in pitch angle in any helical field ) or even with time ( perhaps indicating a fundamental change in the bh / accretion disk system ) ?",
    "here we present dual - frequency , vlba full polarization images of the quasars pks 0607@xmath0157 ( @xmath12 ) and 3c345 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these sources were observed as part of a small survey for circular polarization of 11 powerful agn at 8 and 15 ghz with the vlba ( homan and wardle , in preparation ) .",
    "the sources were observed on january 3 , 1998 .",
    "figure 1 displays a total intensity image of the milli - arcsecond jet of pks 0607@xmath0157 at 8 ghz ( top frame ) and full polarization images of the core region at 8 ghz ( middle frame ) and 15 ghz ( bottom frame ) .",
    "the full polarization images of the core region shows three distinct features in total intensity and linear polarization : ( 1 ) the radio core , ( 2 ) a closely separated feature @xmath14 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) from the core at a position angle of @xmath15 degrees , and ( 3 ) a well separated feature at @xmath16 mas at a position angle of @xmath17 degrees .    for the purposes of this discussion",
    ", we will focus only on the core and its relation to the closely separated jet feature at @xmath18 mas .",
    "preliminary model - fitting shows the core to be optically thick with an inverted spectral index of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the core has fractional linear polarization at the @xmath21% level with no significant difference between 8 and 15 ghz .",
    "the polarization angle ; however , does show significant rotation , @xmath22 degrees . assuming simple @xmath23 faraday rotation is the cause , we calculate a de - rotated position angle of @xmath24 degrees which suggests a longitudinal magnetic field order pointing within 8 degrees of the closely spaced jet feature at @xmath18 mas .",
    "note that this rotation appears spatially associated with the core , as we find no detectable rotation in the polarization vectors of the @xmath18 mas component : @xmath25 degrees .",
    "we find the circular polarization to be associated with the optically thick radio core . at 8 ghz",
    "the core has @xmath26% circular polarization , and at 15 ghz we measure @xmath27% .",
    "we also observed the source a year earlier at 5 ghz , where we found @xmath28% circular polarization on the core @xcite ; however , here we focus on our simultaneous measurements at 8 and 15 ghz .",
    "unfortunately , given the much weaker nature of the optically thin ( @xmath29 ) feature at @xmath18 mas , we can not place useful constraints on its fractional circular polarization .",
    "it is unlikely that the very strong cp we observe at 8 ghz is intrinsic to the emitted synchrotron radiation .",
    "we consider a simple model with longitudinal field order along the jet axis and an additional random component of magnetic field ( which may be shocked but not strongly enough to overcome the net longitudinal field order ) . in this model ,",
    "the longitudinal field is responsible for both the linear and circular polarization we observe , and we estimate that a very high fraction of the total field energy in the jet , @xmath30% , must be in the form of magnetic flux to explain the observed circular polarization by the intrinsic mechanism alone . assuming a conically expanding jet , the resulting square - law dependence of magnetic flux on radius makes it difficult to generate less circular polarization at 15 ghz than at 8 ghz via the intrinsic mechanism ; however , we note that the core is inhomogeneous and it is possible that the local jet conditions ( i.e. density , field strength ) at the 15 ghz optical surface do not follow a simple extrapolation from the 8 ghz core .",
    "faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization can reproduce the observed levels of circular polarization at both 8 and 15 ghz without any requirement for large quantities of magnetic flux in the jet . here",
    "we assume the faraday conversion is driven by a small amount of faraday rotation .",
    "indeed the very rotation we observe in the linear polarization of the core between 8 and 15 ghz , if interpreted as resulting from a small internal faraday depth , is of approximately the right amount ( and is the correct sign ) to drive the conversion process and produce the cp we observe .",
    "the smaller degree of rotation expected at 15 ghz also explains the reduced levels of cp measured at that frequency",
    ".    in this model , the low degree of observed linear polarization ( @xmath21% ) requires a high efficiency for the faraday conversion process to produce @xmath31% cp at 8 ghz .",
    "this requirement for a high efficiency in the faraday conversion process is paired with an apparently small amount of faraday rotation ( @xmath32 by 8 ghz ) .",
    "of course , having only two frequencies restricts our ability to robustly say that any internal faraday rotation is indeed small , but there are a number of lines of supporting evidence : ( 1 ) a low degree of apparent linear de - polarization ( @xmath33% linear polarization at 15 ghz and @xmath34% at 8 ghz ) , ( 2 ) the apparent alignment of the de - rotated magnetic field with the position angle of the first jet feature , and ( 3 ) the consistent prediction for the reduced degree of cp at 15 ghz .",
    "highly efficient faraday conversion demands a small @xmath35 , the low - energy cutoff in the particle power - law spectrum ; however a small value of @xmath35 produces a large amount of faraday rotation , which we argue is not observed .",
    "to suppress the faraday rotation , we need some combination of ( 1 ) many field reversals along the line of sight and/or ( 2 ) a significant population of @xmath5 pairs which produce no faraday rotation .    one alternative to this small faraday rotation depth model is the high rotation depth model of and , which can simultaneously depolarize the linear polarization and produce significant quantities of circular polarization .",
    "while we see no evidence for strong faraday rotation or depolarization between 8 and 15 ghz , the inhomogeneous nature of the core region may allow a fixed amount of depolarization with frequency and an apparently small degree of rotation between the frequencies .",
    "figure 2 displays a total intensity image of the milli - arcsecond jet of 3c345 at 8 ghz ( top frame ) and full polarization images of the core region at 8 ghz ( middle frame ) and 15 ghz ( bottom frame ) .",
    "we only detect circular polarization at 15 ghz , where we see the core component with @xmath36% cp .",
    "this core component also has a distinct linear polarization which is clearly visible at 15 ghz . at 8 ghz",
    ", this component must be quite optically thick as we do not see its contribution in either linear or circular polarization .    without multi - frequency constraints , it is difficult to analyze the circular polarization in detail ; however , we note that the lack of a detectable signal at the location of the 8 ghz optical surface indicates that local conditions in the jet are important to the production of circular polarization",
    ". one might be able to construct simple scaling laws to explain the disappearance of circular polarization at lower frequency , but pks 0607@xmath0157 , which we discuss above , shows the opposite trend .",
    "vlbi studies of circular polarization can provide local measures of both linear and circular polarization at multiple frequencies , which , in principle , allow detailed analysis of the emission mechanism and the physics constrained by it . in the case of 0607@xmath0157 ,",
    "our preliminary analysis favors faraday conversion driven by a small amount of faraday rotation ; however , we are unable to exclude at least two alternative models due , in part , to the inhomogeneous nature of the emission region .",
    "we also present new results on 3c345 which shows strong cp at 15 ghz and no detectable cp at 8 ghz . coupled with our results on pks 0607@xmath0157 , which has the reversed trend with distinctly stronger cp at 8 ghz , it seems clear that local conditions in the jet can have a strong effect on circular polarization and need to be taken into account when studying inhomogeneous objects with multi - frequency observations .",
    "future detailed vlbi studies of circular polarization would greatly benefit from expanded frequency coverage , particularly coverage within bands by using widely separated if channels",
    ". of key importance will be our ability to tie down not only the circular polarization spectrum but also the observed faraday rotation .",
    "such detailed studies require increased sensitivity and a reliable list of calibrator sources , so that an observer can obtain simultaneous , deep observations at each frequency .",
    "enhanced sensitivity and improved calibration will also increase our ability to detect ( or at least usefully limit ) circular polarization in optically thin jet features .",
