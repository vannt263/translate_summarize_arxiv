    "studies of electron - positron pair production in strong external fields are an important tool to reveal the structure of the qed vacuum .",
    "dynamical pair creation by two coulomb fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions has been analysed in great detail , both theoretically and experimentally ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a topical review ) . in recent years , due to the sustained progressing of laser technology , pair creation in strong laser fields is encountering a growing interest . in several theoretical papers pair production in the standing wave formed by two counterpropagating laser beams",
    "has been considered @xcite . in most cases a laser field strength of order or above the critical value @xmath0 v / cm is required in order to observe the process in experiment @xcite , which still is by four orders of magnitude larger than the highest laser field strengths achievable today @xcite .",
    "more promising in view of its experimental realization is pair production in the combination of a laser and a coulomb field . here",
    "one can exploit the possibility to let a nucleus or a highly charged ion collide at large value of the relativistic lorentz factor @xmath1 with the laser beam .",
    "then , in the nuclear rest frame , the laser s field strength @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 are enhanced by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "observable pair creation rates should result for @xmath5 or @xmath6 in this frame ( here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are planck s constant , light velocity and electron mass , respectively ) . with the help of the upcoming novel laser @xcite and accelerator @xcite facilities",
    "these conditions can be met .",
    "the large hadron collider , that is presently under construction at cern ( geneva , switzerland ) , will accelerate protons to an energy of 7 tev ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "when such protons are brought into collision with the strongest laser beams available today ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 ev ) , then the laser field strength in the proton s rest frame approaches or even exceeds the critical value . on the other hand , the x - ray free - electron laser ( xfel ) facilities",
    "presently being developed at desy ( hamburg , germany ) and slac ( stanford , usa ) are proposed to provide spatially coherent and highly brilliant beams of synchrotron radiation with single - photon energies of up to @xmath13 kev at maximum field strengths of @xmath14 @xcite . when combined with a moderately relativistic ion beam",
    ", the laser photon energy in the projectile frame can reach the electron s rest energy .",
    "we should mention that a few years ago nonlinear electron - positron pair creation in the collision of an ultrarelativistic electron beam ( @xmath15 ) and an intense optical laser pulse was observed at slac @xcite .",
    "in this situation , there are two channels for pair production : a direct channel , via laser - photon absorption in the coulomb field of the electron , and an indirect two - step channel ( so - called breit - wheeler process ) , where first a high - energy photon is generated by compton backscattering which afterwards creates the pair via absorption of laser photons @xcite . in the experiment",
    "the contribution of the indirect channel was shown to be dominant . in the present paper , however , the indirect production mechanism will not be addressed .",
    "it is of importance only in the case of a light projectile beam .",
    "in fact , when the incoming electrons were replaced by a beam of heavy particles ( e.g. , protons ) the indirect production channel would be strongly suppressed and direct nonlinear pair production ( by a virtual photon from the nuclear coulomb field ) could be investigated .",
    "the latter process is the subject of this paper .",
    "the first calculation of pair creation by a coulomb and a strong laser field is due to yakovlev @xcite .",
    "he treated the case of circular laser polarization and derived asymptotic formulae for the production rate in certain parameter regimes .",
    "particularly , the total cross sections in the perturbative regime ( @xmath16 , with the intensity parameter @xmath17 given in eq.([xi ] ) below ) as well as in the overcritical - field limit ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) were obtained .",
    "twenty years later , mittleman @xcite considered the process in a linearly polarized laser wave .",
    "his calculation of the leading term for the total cross section in the perturbative multiphoton regime ( @xmath16 and @xmath20 ) led him to the conclusion that , for the laser intensities and frequencies available at that time , this cross section was the smallest one on record . despite of this pessimistic result , another twenty years later the great headway in laser technology that was following the invention of chirped - pulse amplification @xcite triggered newly revived interest in the process .",
    "dietz and prbsting @xcite investigated the influence of a highly charged ion of charge @xmath21 within a nonperturbative numerical approach .",
    "however , to make their coupled - channel calculations feasible they treated the laser field in dipole approximation . while in the earlier work the nucleus was always assumed at rest , mller , voitkiv , and grn explored in detail the improved opportunities arising from laser - nucleus collisions . in the articles @xcite they performed numerical calculations for tunneling pair production by an ultrarelativistic nucleus colliding with a superintense near - infrared laser beam and for multiphoton pair creation by a moderately relativistic ion beam in combination with an intense x - ray laser wave .",
    "moreover , they considered the variant of bound - free pair production where the electron is created in a bound state of the projectile nucleus @xcite .",
    "free pair creation in the collision of a relativistic nucleus with an ultrastrong x - ray laser of circular polarization was also treated by avetissian , avetissian , mkrtchian , and sedrakian in ref.@xcite , where analytical formulae in the high - intensity limit and some numerical results on the energy spectrum of the created particles in the nonperturbative multiphoton regime ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are given .",
    "most of the treatments mentioned above fully account for the influence of the external laser field by using the volkov solutions to the dirac equation as basis states in a perturbative calculation of first order with respect to the nuclear coulomb field . within this framework , the fully differential pair creation rate can be expressed as a fourier series over the number of absorbed laser photons , the coefficients of which are essentially given by ordinary or generalized bessel functions for circular or linear laser polarization , respectively . because of the large photon numbers involved , taking this sum is one of the main obstacles in this kind of approach , in particular for a linearly polarized laser wave . as a consequence , it is difficult to get useable expressions for the total production rate .     pictorial equation in terms of feynman diagrams describing @xmath24 pair production in combined laser and coulomb fields . in our approach",
    ", the coulomb field is treated within the first order of perturbation theory , while the effect of the laser wave is nonperturbatively taken into account to all orders .",
    "this is expressed by the feynman graph on the left - hand side , where the double lines represent the exact lepton wave - functions in the laser field ( volkov states ) , while the dashed line stands for their interaction with the coulomb field .",
    "expanding the volkov states with respect to the lepton - laser coupling results in a perturbation series , some typical low - order terms of which are shown on the right - hand side .",
    "the wavy lines symbolize the laser photons and the arrows indicate whether the respective laser photon is emitted or absorbed during the process . the first diagram on the right - hand side ,",
    "e.g. , describes the leading order of pair production by the net - absorption of one laser photon ( with @xmath25 ) . for later reference",
    ", we note that the interference between the first and the fourth diagram leads to a @xmath26-correction to the probability for one - photon pair creation [ cf .",
    "eq.([delta ] ) below].,width=302 ]    in the present paper a different approach based on the optical theorem is used to calculate the total rate for pair creation in combined laser and coulomb fields .",
    "this approach employs the explicit form of the polarization operator of a photon in a laser field found by baier , milstein , and strakhovenko @xcite by means of an operator technique .",
    "an alternative form of this polarization operator was derived independently by becker and mitter @xcite by means of another method .",
    "both results are in agreement with each other .",
    "similar to refs.@xcite the interaction of the leptons with the laser field is taken into account to all orders while the effect of the coulomb field is treated in first order ( cf .",
    "1 ) . the main advantage of our method is the possibility to derive , independent of the laser s polarization state , in an analytical manner compact formulae for the total production rate that only involve low - dimensional integrals and no additional summations .",
    "based on these representations one can rather easily find all different kinds of asymptotics . in this way we will confirm and extend previous results for a circularly polarized laser wave and give for the first time corresponding expressions for elliptic laser polarization . as a main result , we show that there are essential differences between the general case of an elliptically polarized laser field and the special case of circular polarization . furthermore , because of its interest for near - future experiments , particular emphasis is placed on the nonlinear process of pair creation by the simultaneous absorption of two photons from the laser wave in a situation , where the energy of a single photon is not sufficient to produce a pair and where the contribution from higher photon orders is neglibly small .",
    "we note that , in general , contributions stemming from different net - numbers of absorbed laser photons can be distinguished via the momentum spectra of the produced particles .",
    "in addition , the strong - field regimes of pair production shall be examined .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe how the polarization operator is related to the process of pair creation , and how it can be used to calculate the total pair production rate in the superposition of a coulomb and a laser field .",
    "general formulae are given in terms of two - fold integrals for both circular and elliptic laser polarization .",
    "in the following section we apply these expressions to various parameter regions and determine the corresponding asymptotic behaviour of the pair production rate .",
    "special attention is paid to the nonlinear process of pair production by two - photon absorption in the limit of low laser intensity , for which in particular the behaviour close to the energetic threshold is investigated . moreover , the pair - creation cross - section in the high - frequency limit ( @xmath27 ) is analysed , where we calculate the next - to - leading order correction to one - photon pair production at low intensity and analyse the limiting case of high laser intensity .",
    "finally , we consider the overcritical - field regime as well as the quasiclassical limit of high intensity and low frequency , where the rate shows an exponential tunneling behaviour . we finish with a conclusion where the significance of our results in view of possible experimental investigations is discussed .",
    "the polarization operator @xmath28 describes the propagation of a photon of four - momentum @xmath29 in a background field ( e.g. , the qed vacuum ) , including self - energy corrections .",
    "it is related to the corresponding exact photon propagator @xmath30 via dyson s equation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the free photon propagator . in refs.@xcite",
    "the ( properly renormalized ) polarization operator was evaluated in the combined fields of the qed vacuum and a classical electromagnetic plane wave . the interaction with the vacuum",
    "was taken into account to first order in the fine - structure constant @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the electron charge , while the interaction with the plane - wave field was included to all orders . in the following",
    ", the shape of the electromagnetic wave will be taken as @xmath35 with @xmath36 and the dimensionless intensity parameters @xmath37 here and henceforth we use relativistic units with @xmath38 and write @xmath39 for the product of two four - vectors .",
    "the respective result on the polarization operator of a photon in a constant electric field instead of a plane electromagnetic wave can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "apart from its theoretical significance , the knowledge of the polarization operator allows for a number of applications .",
    "for example , the total probability for @xmath24 pair production by a photon of momentum @xmath40 in an external field ( e.g. , a plane laser wave ) is related to the imaginary part of the corresponding polarization operator via @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the photon s polarization four - vector . in fig.2",
    "we give an intuitive , pictorial explanation of this formula .",
    "lowest order ( in @xmath43 ) feynman graph for the polarization operator of a photon in an external laser field . in our case",
    "the photon is a virtual one stemming from a coulomb field ( outer dashed lines ) .",
    "the diagram can be viewed as describing the elastic forward scattering of the photon through an intermediate laser - dressed @xmath24 state ( double line ) . by performing ,",
    "as indicated , a cut along the central dashed line , it is seen that the graph represents the product of the amplitude for the production of a laser - dressed @xmath24 pair by the virtual photon and its complex conjugate , including a sum over all electron states .",
    "application of the optical theorem ( i.e. , the unitarity of the scattering matrix ) therefore relates the imaginary part of the polarization operator with the total probability for pair creation , as expressed by eqs.([ppph ] ) and ( [ w]).,width=94 ]      the calculation in ref.@xcite was performed for an arbitrary photon momentum @xmath29 , including the case @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the polarization operator found there not only applies to the combination `` photon + laser wave '' .",
    "instead , the photon may be replaced by any additional external field @xmath45 , e.g. a nuclear coulomb field .",
    "since a coulomb field can transfer momentum but not energy , here one has @xmath46 . to get , at a given value of @xmath47 , the differential probability ( per unit time ) for @xmath24 pair creation one has to replace the photon wave - function @xmath48 in eq.([ppph ] ) by the fourier transform of the coulomb field @xmath49 . here",
    ", @xmath50 denotes the nuclear charge number .",
    "the total production rate then is found by integration over all possible momenta : @xmath51 note that in eq.([w ] ) the additional factor of 1/2 compensates for the double - counting of the contributions from the momenta @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "for the case of a constant homogeneous electromagnetic field the relation ( [ w ] ) was used in ref.@xcite , where the probability for pair production was found within the quasiclassical approximation for the polarization operator .    according to the results of ref.@xcite , the required component of the polarization operator in eq.([w ] )",

    "this suppression has the same nature as in the case of @xmath24 pair production by a real photon in a laser field @xcite .",

    ", we will throughout assume an xfel pulse duration of @xmath194 fs .",
    "the xfel beam collides with a bunch of protons moving at @xmath195 , containing 10@xmath196 particles , and having a beam radius of 30 @xmath168 m . in the one - photon perturbative regime , assuming an xfel photon energy of @xmath197 kev , an intensity parameter of @xmath198 , and a beam radius of @xmath199 @xmath168 m , we find that @xmath200 pairs are produced per collision . for a given laser intensity ,",
    "the number of created particles is independent of the laser s polarization state . in the second regime of two - photon pair creation , employing a linearly polarized xfel beam is more favorable .",
    "supposing the collision parameters @xmath201 kev , @xmath202 , and @xmath199 @xmath168 m , the process proceeds far above threshold and one pair can be produced per shot . in the overcritical - field regime ,",
    "circular polarization of the xfel beam leads to higher production yields . in this regime ,",
    "a large @xmath17-value is necessary , which can be achieved by focusing the xfel beam @xcite . for @xmath203 , @xmath197 kev and @xmath204 nm",
    ", one pair can be produced per collision .",
    "here one has to take into account that the xfel pulse will interact only with a very small fraction of the proton bunch . for the assumed parameters ,",
    "the latter has a length of 10 cm and contains a particle density of 10@xmath205 @xmath206 .",
    "thus , we see that , in principle , experimental studies of the pair production process are possible by using an xfel and a relativistic proton beam . employing a non - focused xfel beam ( cf . the so - called design and available parameters in table 1 of ref.@xcite ) and an ultra - relativistic proton beam ,",
    "the perturbative regimes of pair creation can be realized , including nonlinear pair production via two - photon absorption .",
    "the realization of the strong - field regimes with @xmath18 will require focusing of the xfel beam ( cf . the goal parameters in table 1 of ref.@xcite ) . in this case",
    "the interaction volume , i.e. the region of beam overlap , is extremely small which substantially decreases the total production probability . as a result",
    ", the pair creation seems unrealistic in the tunneling regime but , at least in principle , feasible in the overcritical - field regime .    in summary , with the novel sources of spatially coherent x - rays along with the relativistic proton beams of desy , the results on pair production presented in this paper could be tested .",
