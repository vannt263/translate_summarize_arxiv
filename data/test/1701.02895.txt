    "according to gough et al @xcite , `` by using a dual - demodulator continuous time frequency modulation ( dd - ctfm ) system the demodulated signal can be made continuous , resulting in the complete elimination of the blind time and in a range resolution as good as two wavelengths of the mean frequency '' .",
    "however , in practice dd - ctfm technique does not offer significant improvement in range resolution . actually , the range resolution improvement is only 10 to 20 % depending on the blind time duration over a conventional ctfm technique .",
    "the range resolution of ctfm technique is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the speed of the wave and @xmath2 is the bandwidth of the signal @xcite .",
    "the reason for the limitation of dd - ctfm technique is the phase mismatch at the boundaries of the concatenated segments from the two channels in the difference frequency signal in each sweep cycle .",
    "the phase mismatch problem makes the claim of gough et al @xcite to be incorrect which states that `` we have managed to eliminate the blind time associated with conventional ctfm sonars , thus making the output truly continuous '' .",
    "this issue was not addressed in @xcite and is explained in this paper .",
    "the next section discusses the basic principle of dd - ctfm technique .",
    "section iii describes the issues in obtaining higher range resolution using dd - ctfm .",
    "the final section concludes this paper .",
    "the problem of blind time limits the observation time and hence the range resolution in ctfm @xcite . according to gough et al @xcite",
    ", dd - ctfm receiver processing eliminates the blind time and thereby increases the observation time leading to high resolution in frequency and hence range .",
    "as proposed in fig [ fig5.3 ] , the output of dd - ctfm processing should ideally consist of continuous sinusoids , whose frequencies are proportional to the range of the reflection interfaces . in the output of dd - ctfm processing , continuity of sinusoids across the sweep periods",
    "is achieved by extending the transmitted signal by a duration equal to the maximum blind time using a local oscillator in the second channel as shown in fig [ fig5.3 ] .",
    "the local oscillator generates a linear frequency in phase continuity with the transmitted signal with identical slope same as the transmitted signal .",
    "the frequency of the local oscillator increases from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the receiver has two channels , with the processing in channel 1 being the same as in ctfm technique @xcite . in channel 1 the received signal",
    "is multiplied with the transmitted signal and low pass filtered while in channel 2 , the received signal is multiplied with the signal from the local oscillator and low pass filtered . to obtain a continuous waveform , the outputs of both channels are added .",
    "now , the added low pass filtered signals from both the channels can be ideally expected to be continuous with no blind time .",
    "hence , one can ideally expect to obtain any desired frequency resolution , as the observation time can be extended to any duration .",
    "in doing careful analysis of the dd - ctfm technique , it is found that there is a problem of phase discontinuity in the output signal .",
    "the output signal of dd - ctfm processing should ideally contain a sinusoidal waveform without any phase discontinuity , corresponding to each echo .",
    "however , there will be phase discontinuity in the concatenated sinusoids from the two channels as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5.5 ] .     from bottom ) and actual waveform ( bottom).,width=585,height=332 ]    the time - frequency plot and difference frequency signal waveforms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5.5 ] .",
    "the upper part of fig . [ fig5.5 ] shows the time - frequency plots of the transmitted and received signals for a single target . the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig5.5 ] shows the incorrect jump frequency ( that does not contain the range information ) and correct difference frequency signals respectively .",
    "the correct difference frequency signal refers to the desired signal corresponding to the actual delay .",
    "the jump difference frequency signal is incorrect as it contains wrong information of the delay . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5.5 ] , the correct difference frequency signal is obtained from a segment of the total cycle duration only from channel 1 . in the remaining part of each cycle",
    "just after the frequency jumps in the transmitted signal , the difference frequency signal becomes incorrect in channel 1 .",
    "the duration for which we get the incorrect difference frequency signal is known as blind time and it depends on the target range .",
    "the blind time limits the total observation time of the correct frequency and hence limits the frequency resolution . to get the correct difference frequency signal during the blind time , a second channel with a local oscillator",
    "was proposed by gough et al @xcite .",
    "the desired added signal from both the channels is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5.5 ] by the second last waveform , which does not contain any phase discontinuity .",
    "however , the actual concatenated sinusoids shown by the bottom waveform contains the phase discontinuity , which limits the observation time and hence the range resolution .",
    "let the transmitted signal @xmath5 be a linear frequency modulated signal ( up - chirp ) represented as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the starting frequency of the lfm signal and @xmath8 is the sweep rate .",
    "let @xmath9 be the instantaneous phase of the transmitted signal given as : @xmath10 let the received signal @xmath11 be a delayed version of the transmitted signal given as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the time delay of the received signal .",
    "the instantaneous phase of @xmath11 be expressed as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the phase of @xmath11 at time @xmath16 .",
    "the transmitted and received signals are multiplied and low pass filtered in channel 1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5.3 ] . to get the ideally desired signal corresponding to a range cell during the blind time , a local oscillator is used . according to gough et al @xcite",
    "if the local oscillator is in phase continuity with the transmitted signal and with the same slope , we should get a continuous sinusoidal signal after the addition of the two channels .",
    "let the local oscillator signal which is in phase continuity with the transmitted signal be given as : @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the starting frequency of the local oscillator , that is equal to the final frequency of the transmitted chirp signal .",
    "the initial phase @xmath18 of the local oscillator is equal to the phase of the transmitted signal at the instant when the transmitted signal frequency reaches its final value .",
    "the initial phase @xmath18 is calculated using ( [ px ] ) as : @xmath19 let the phase of @xmath20 be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "it is given as : @xmath22 the phase of the low pass filtered signal at the output of channel 1 is calculated as : @xmath23 the phase of the low pass filtered signal at the output of channel 2 is calculated as : @xmath24    let the starting frequency @xmath7 , the final frequency @xmath3 and the duration @xmath25 of the chirp signal be taken as 100 hz , 200 hz and 300 ms respectively . let the delay @xmath13 in the received signal be 93 ms .",
    "the value of @xmath8 for this case is 333.3 hz / sec .",
    "the phase of the transmitted signal at @xmath26 ms using ( [ px ] ) is @xmath27 radians .",
    "the phase of the received signal at this instant using ( [ py ] ) is @xmath28 radians .",
    "so , the phase of the low pass filtered signal using ( [ pc1 ] ) at @xmath26 ms from channel 1 is @xmath29 radians . at @xmath26 ms , the transmitted signal will jump back to its starting frequency of 100 hz for the next cycle .",
    "now , the desired signal during the blind time is provided by channel 2 . using ( [ py ] ) and ( [ pl ] )",
    ", the phase of the received signal @xmath30 and local oscillator signal @xmath31 at @xmath26 ms are @xmath28 and @xmath27 radians respectively .",
    "so , using ( [ pc2 ] ) the starting phase of the low pass filtered signal from channel 2 is @xmath29 radians .",
    "thus , the phase of signals from the two channels is continuous without any discontinuity at @xmath26 ms .    at @xmath32 ms",
    ", the desired signal is obtained from channel 2 .",
    "the phase of the local oscillator @xmath31 and the received signal @xmath30 at @xmath32 ms using ( [ pl ] ) and ( [ px ] ) , are @xmath33 and @xmath27 radians respectively .",
    "so , the phase of the low pass filtered signal from channel 2 at the end of the first cycle using ( [ pc2 ] ) is @xmath34 radians .",
    "the desired signal just after @xmath32 ms is again obtained from channel 1 . at @xmath32 ms in the next cycle , the phase of the transmitted @xmath35 and the received signals @xmath30 using ( [ px ] ) and ( [ py ] ) , are @xmath36 and @xmath27 radians respectively .",
    "the starting phase of channel 1 in the second cycle using ( [ pc1 ] ) is @xmath37 radians that is very different from the previous phase of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the added difference frequency signal from the two channels contains a strong phase discontinuity after @xmath32 ms .",
    "thus , the observation duration of the sinusoidal signal corresponding to an echo is increased only by a duration equal to blind time , which is a fraction of total chirp duration .",
    "so , one can not increase the observation duration to any desired value as claimed in @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the phase of the two channels at various instants with a typical example explained above are summarized in table [ t5mdaa ] to demonstrate the phase discontinuity issue .",
    ".parameters for calculation of phase mismatch in dd - ctfm processing . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the simulation study the parameters starting frequency @xmath7 , final frequency @xmath3 and duration @xmath25 of the chirp signal are taken to be 100 hz , 200 hz and 300 ms respectively .",
    "the parameters starting frequency @xmath3 , final frequency @xmath4 and duration @xmath25 of the chirp signal generated using local oscillator are taken to be 200 hz , 240 hz and 120 ms respectively .",
    "the number of sweep cycles are taken to be 12 , so the output signal duration is 3.6 seconds .",
    "the maximum duration of blind time is assumed to be 120 ms .",
    "the initial phase of the transmitted chirp signal is taken as 0 .",
    "the initial phase of the local oscillator is taken to be same as the phase of the transmitted chirp signal at 300 ms .",
    "let the received signal consist of a delayed version of the transmitted signal .",
    "let the delay in the received signal be 96 ms .",
    "so , the dd - ctfm output frequency in this simulation should ideally be 32 hz .",
    "however , it is estimated as 31.01 hz as observed from fig .",
    "[ fig5.26 ] for this simulated case . due to phase discontinuities in every sweep of the chirp signal , the observation time",
    "is still limited just as in case of ctfm processing and hence there will be an error in the estimate of the correct difference frequency .",
    "thus , the range resolution improvement in dd - ctfm technique is only slightly better depending upon the blind time duration compared to @xmath38 of ctfm technique .",
    "this improvement is negligible compared to the claim made in @xcite which states that `` the output will be truly continuous resulting in the complete elimination of the blind time and in a range resolution as good as two wavelengths of the mean frequency '' .",
    "there is another issue of sidelobe artifacts in the dft magnitude of the dd - ctfm output signal .",
    "the artifacts are located at integer multiples of @xmath39 hz around the estimated frequency in the form of peaks at several bins in dft of the dd - ctfm output signal .",
    "for the simulation example , the side lobe artifacts exist at integer multiples of @xmath40 hz as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5.26 ] , from @xmath41 hz . the side lobe artifacts are only 2.3 times i.e. , 7.26 db down the main peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5.26 ] .",
    "thus , another weaker target echo with amplitude up to 7.26 db below the main echo magnitude , will not be detected .",
    "the issues in dd - ctfm technique proposed by gough et al @xcite are presented .",
