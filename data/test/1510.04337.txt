    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) such as molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) have layered structures , where the atoms within a tmd monolayer form a covalently bonded planar network , and the interaction between these layers is a weak , van der waals interaction.@xcite a monolayer of mos@xmath0  consists of a layer of molybdenum atoms sandwiched between two layers of sulfur atoms .",
    "monolayers can be exfoliated through micro - mechanical cleavage , similar to graphene or boron nitride.@xcite unlike graphene ( a metal ) , or boron nitride ( an insulator ) , mos@xmath0  is a semiconductor .",
    "moreover , whereas bulk mos@xmath0  has an indirect band gap ( 1.2 ev ) , monolayer mos@xmath0  has a direct band gap ( @xmath21.8 - 1.9 ev ) , and shows a strong optical absorption and luminescence.@xcite at present mos@xmath0 , and tmds in general , are vehemently pursued as promising materials for applications in electronics and optoelectronics.@xcite    contacting mos@xmath0  to metal electrodes proves to be a problem ; it tends to produce unexpectedly high interface resistances , indicative of a high schottky barrier at the interface.@xcite a high barrier could be caused by strong interface bonding creating interface states that pin the fermi level,@xcite or by weak bonding creating a potential step due to pauli repulsion at the interface.@xcite the nature of the interaction at the mos@xmath0/metal interface is far from trivial .",
    "on the one hand , one could argue that , as mos@xmath0  has no dangling bonds at its surface , its interaction with metal substrates should be weak and van - der - waals - like . on the other hand , many metal species form ( di)chalcogenide compounds,@xcite and when adsorbing mos@xmath0  onto a metal substrate , there could be a competition between the metal surface and the mo atoms for interacting with the sulfur atoms at the interface . in that case ,",
    "not only the mos@xmath0/metal bonding would be a much stronger chemical bonding , but also the structure and electronic structure of the mos@xmath0  adsorbate could be significantly perturbed .    in this paper",
    "we explore the adsorption of mos@xmath0  on a variety of metal substrates by means of first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , following up on work briefly reported in a short paper.@xcite previous dft studies have concentrated foremost on the schottky barrier formed at mos@xmath0/metal interfaces using the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite lda gives a reasonable description of the adsorption of graphene and _",

    "we choose a wide range of metal substrates : the ( 111 ) surfaces of al , ni , cu , pd , ag , pt and au , and the ( 0001 ) surfaces of mg , ti , and co , which are expected to have a wide range of interaction strength with the adsorbate .",
    "as the interface interaction can vary from weak ( physisorption ) to strong ( chemisorption ) , it is a priori not clear which dft functional describes such bonding .",
    "we test and compare results obtained with a van der waals functional , designed to describe weak , van der waals , interactions,@xcite to results obtained with gga and lda functionals , which are conventionally used to describe chemical bonding .",
    "we assess the importance of van der waals interactions for the interface interaction , and evaluate its effect on the structure and electronic structure of the mos@xmath0  adsorbant .",
    "we consider the situation where a mos@xmath0  layer is adsorbed as a whole on a metal substrate , making it more likely that the integrity of the mos@xmath0  layer is preserved in the adsorption process .",
    "if the mos@xmath0/metal interaction is not too strong , and the mos@xmath0  and metal surface lattices are not matched , the interface structure is likely to be incommensurable . in a supercell calculation one",
    "is forced to approximate such a structure by a commensurable one .",
    "previous calculations have used small supercells , where in some cases appreciable artificial strain is generated because of the mismatch between the mos@xmath0  and the metal surface lattices.@xcite we apply a strategy for choosing supercells such that the artificial strain is minimal , and test the influence of strain on the electronic properties of the interface .",

    "somewhat surprisingly , a significant density of interface states also forms if the interaction between mos@xmath0  and the metal substrate is relatively weak .",
    "for example , as discussed in the previous section , the interaction between mos@xmath0  and al(111 ) can be classified as physisorption , see fig .",
    "[ fig : physchem ] .",
    "nevertheless , states with energies inside the mos@xmath0  band gap are formed at the mos@xmath0/al(111 ) interface , as is immediately obvious when comparing the density of states of the interface with that of free - standing mos@xmath0 , see fig .",

    "this breaks the direct mos@xmath0/metal contact that is responsible for the formation of interface states . in the absence of interface states ,",

    "lda in general gives even higher work functions , so opt88-vdw - df gives work functions that are in between those of pbe and lda.@xcite note that the interface potential steps @xmath19 do not depend strongly on the functional . as the opt88-vdw - df functional also gives a larger electron affinity for mos@xmath0 , the schottky barrier @xmath26 according to eq .",

    "the result therefore is a mos@xmath0/ti(0001 ) interface that contains a substantial local strain , which explains why the binding energy is not very large , despite the bonding being chemisorption .",
    "the potential step @xmath19 at the mos@xmath0/ti(0001 ) interface is negative , in contrast to the potential step at the mos@xmath0/ag(111 ) interface for instance , which is positive , despite the fact that the work functions of ti and ag are very similar , see table  [ tab : deltav ] .",

    "this displacement results in an increase of the work function , i.e. , a negative @xmath19 .",
    "one expects that chemisorption also leads to a strong perturbation of the electronic structure of the adsorbate .",

    "[ fig : dos_ti ] .",
    "the height of the schottky barrier to the second layer is a sizable 0.54 ev .",

    "the gga / pbe density functional only captures a small part of the binding energy of mos@xmath0  on a metal substrate , as compared to the opt88-vdw - df van der waals density functional , which indicates the importance of van der waals interactions in the interface bonding . nevertheless , the equilibrium binding distances obtained with both functionals are generally very similar , and so are the interface potential steps and schottky barrier heights .",
    "exceptions are cases for which van der waals interactions essentially describe the whole bonding , where pbe fails completely .",
    "lda tends to overbind , leading to shorter binding distances and larger interface potential steps .",
    "the interface structure that results from adsorbing an mos@xmath0  layer on a metal surface will be incommensurable in most cases , as the two lattices have a mismatch .",
    "we investigate the effects of the artificial strain introduced by approximating the lattice using a commensurable supercell .",
    "we conclude that these effects are moderate provided the mos@xmath0  lattice parameter is kept at its optimized value , and the metal lattice is strained .",
    "large lattice mismatches should however be avoided , and straining the mos@xmath0  lattice can lead to very unphysical results.@xcite    of the metal substrates studied ti is the one on which mos@xmath0  is clearly chemisorbed .",
    "adsorption of mos@xmath0  on ti(0001 ) is accompanied by a clear structural deformation of the ti surface and of the mos@xmath0  overlayer , due to the formation of bonds between the surface ti atoms and the sulfur atoms at the interface .",
    "formation of these interface bonds significantly alters the electronic structure of the mos@xmath0  adsorbate .",
    "in particular , the interface states fill up the band gap of mos@xmath0 , which makes defining a schottky barrier for this layer meaningless . however , for a second , unperturbed , adsorbed mos@xmath0  layer a schottky barrier of 0.54 ev can be extracted .",

    "transport measurements on multilayer mos@xmath0  devices generally yield small numbers for the schottky barrier heights , i.e. 0.03 - 0.2 ev , for different metals,@xcite whereas photoemission , photoconduction , and scanning tunneling spectroscopy give higher values 0.2 - 0.9 ev.@xcite it has been suggested that the mos@xmath0  samples used in devices is quite defective and inhomogeneous , such that the position of the fermi level does not reflect an intrinsic property of mos@xmath0  or of the mos@xmath0/metal contact,@xcite which obstructs a comparison to calculated results .    our results for the 4d and 5d metals ag , au , pd , and",
    "pt agree qualitatively with those reported in previous calculations,@xcite provided the mos@xmath0  lattice is not stretched.@xcite quantitatively , the reported schottky barrier heights for these metals are @xmath122 ev larger than our results .",
    "these calculations were based upon the lda functional , which tends to overbind , and to overestimate the metal work functions.@xcite compressing the metal lattice , which is sometimes required to accommodate a lattice mismatch in a small supercell , does not help either , as that gives an even higher work function.@xcite the same is likely true for simple metals such as al and in.@xcite the strong interaction we find for ti is also found in lda calculations.@xcite in those calculations the lattice mismatch used was large , however , which can alter the interface interactions .",
    "the overall picture emerging from these calculations is that mos@xmath0  interacts strongly with the early transition metals , where it is clearly chemisorbed .",
    "the interaction with the late transition metals is much weaker , where the 3d metals interact stronger than the 4d and 5d metals .",
    "interacts rather weakly with the simple metals , but the interaction increases for very low work function metals . in all but the strongly chemisorbed case ,",
    "van der waals forces play an important role in the interface interactions .    in case",
    "the interface interaction is weak ( physisorption ) the interface potential step can be understood as resulting from pauli repulsion , which effectively decreases the substrate work function .",
    "the schottky barrier is then simply calculated from the modified work function .",
    "strong interaction ( chemisorption ) leads to the formation of bonds between the substrate metal atoms and the adsorbate sulfur atoms .",
    "it increases the substrate work function if the electronegativity of the adsorbate is higher than that of the metal .",
