    "predictions of standard model ( sm ) have so far been in agreement with results of numerous experiments .",
    "therefore , sm has been in use to explain many puzzles related to fundamental particles and their interactions .",
    "however , there have been a number of fundamental problems ( quark - lepton symmetry , family replication , hierarchy problems , charge quantization etc . )",
    "sm could not deal with .",
    "furthermore , masses and mixings of leptons and quarks are fixed by hand .",
    "these problems forced physicists to go beyond sm .",
    "extra dimensions , supersymmetry ( susy ) , compositeness and so on have been created for solving these problems and to explain the physics underlying them .    among these alternative models compositeness",
    "has explained the subjects of family replication and quark - lepton symmetry in the best manner according to the theory of compositeness quarks , leptons , gauge bosons need to be composite particles made up of more basic constituents .",
    "these basic constituents , in otherwords substructural particles , are named preons .",
    "it is assumed that preons are what compose quarks , leptons and gauge bosons .",
    "it s also supposed that preons interactions lead to development of many new types of particles such as leptoquarks , leptogluons , diquarks , dileptons and excited fermions .",
    "we will be interested in color octet leptons that in the framework of composite models with colored preons @xcite have the same status as the excited leptons .",
    "for instance , in the framework of fermion - scalar models , leptons would be a bound state of one fermionic preon and one scalar anti - preon @xmath6 ( both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are color triplets ) , then each sm lepton is thought to accompany with its own color octet partner @xcite .",
    "there are many papers about manifestations of excited leptons at high energy colliders whereas color octet leptons are discussed only in a few papers @xcite .",
    "resonant production of @xmath0 at future ep colliders have been analyzed in recent paper @xcite , where also current limits on leptogluon masses are briefly discussed .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath0 discovery at the lhec simultaneously will determine the compositeness scale .    in this paper",
    "we will consider indirect manifestation of color octet electrons at the next generation linear colliders : international linear collider ( ilc ) and compact linear collider ( clic ) . in section 2 , we present the interaction lagrangian of the leptogluons as well as signal cross - section for the process @xmath9 via t - channel @xmath0 exchange .",
    "the signal and background analysis performed at ilc and clic is given in section 3 .",
    "in the last section we give an interpretation of obtained results and concluding remarks .",
    "the interaction lagrangian of leptogluons with the corresponding lepton and gluon is given by @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is field strength tensor for gluon , index @xmath12 denotes the color , @xmath13 is gauge coupling , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the chirality factors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote left and right spinor components of lepton , @xmath18 is the anti - symmetric tensor and @xmath19 is the compositeness scale , which is taken to be equal to @xmath20 .",
    "the leptonic chiral invariance implies @xmath21@xmath22 . for numerical calculations we implement this lagrangian into the calchep program @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for the process @xmath9 via t - channel @xmath0 exchange at @xmath3 tev are presented in figure 1 .",
    "isr and beamstrahlung effects at ilc and clic are calculated with calchep program using parameters given in table i @xcite .",
    ".main parameters of ilc and clic . here",
    "n is the number of particles in bunch . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are rms beam sizes at interaction point ( ip ) , @xmath25 is the rms bunch length . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     up to now , we assumed the compositeness scale equal to the mass of color octet electron ( @xmath26 ) . in general case",
    "this scale can be decoupled from the mass of new particles .",
    "for this reason below we consider limits for the compositeness scale as a function of the color octet electron mass . in this analysis",
    "we use @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 for ilc , clic1 and clic2 , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to one year operation with nominal luminosities .    in figure 9 , 10 and 11 we plot reachable values of the compositeness scale as a function of @xmath20 for ilc , clic1 and clic2 , respectively .",
    "tev and @xmath31 @xmath30 . ]     tev and @xmath32 @xmath30 . ]     tev and @xmath33 @xmath30 . ]",
    "we show that , if @xmath26 ilc will give opportunity for indirect observation of octet electron upto @xmath34 @xmath35 gev during one ( three ) operation with nominal luminosity .",
    "corresponding values for clic1 are about @xmath36 gev lower .",
    "therefore , both ilc and clic1 will give opportunity to pass essentially the tevatron capacity for color octet electron ( @xmath0 ) search .",
    "clic2 will be sensitive to @xmath37 times higher mass values , namely , @xmath0 masses upto @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) gev could be observed during one ( three ) year operation with nominal luminosity .",
    "these values essentially exceed capacity of the lhc to observe color octet electron ( @xmath0 ) via pair production .",
    "if the compositeness scale and color octet electron mass are decoupled , observable values of @xmath19 at ilc and clic1 exceeds @xmath20 for @xmath40 gev ( at @xmath41 gev the ratio @xmath42 ) . at the clic2 @xmath19 exceeds mass for @xmath43 gev ( at @xmath44 gev observable @xmath19",
    "is @xmath45 gev ) .",
