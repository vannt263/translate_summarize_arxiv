    "edge localised modes ( elms ) are bursty , quasi - periodic expulsions of energy and particles from the plasma edge in the high - confinement state of toroidal magnetised plasmas @xcite .",
    "elms originate from the steep pressure gradient pedestal in the outer closed field line region of a tokamak .",
    "a substantial release of magnetic and potential energy , caused by a rapid rise of the rate of momentum transfer through the flux surfaces , leads to enhanced transport and loss of heat and particles into the open scrape - off layer ( sol ) field line region .",
    "the filamented peak heat fluxes during elms on the bounding divertor plates present serious restrictions on the performance of future fusion experiments like iter @xcite and necessitate the development of suitable control techniques @xcite .",
    "elms generically have been observed in all divertor tokamaks since the initial discovery of the high - confinement `` h - mode '' state in the early 1980s @xcite , while characteristics like frequency and intensity are found to vary widely depending on experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "stellarator experiments also are reported to show similar bursty quasi - periodic edge activity in the presence of edge transport barriers @xcite .",
    "indication that equilibrium drifts are part of the process has been found by experimental diagnosis of an asymmetry of the energy and particle fluxes on each of the divertor plates and evidence that this is sensitive to the directions of the toroidal current and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , edge localised mode events in tokamaks have been compared to solar flare eruptions @xcite , and , in the cataclysmic variability of observed radiation emanating from the plasma , they may seem to bear also some remote resemblance to the outbursts of pressure - driven dwarf novae @xcite , although the specific instability mechanisms behind these phenomena are clearly of a substantially different nature .",
    "on the other hand , the nature of elms has also not yet been completely clarified , in the sense that there is no first - principles based predictive theory available .",
    "a number of characteristically different variations of elms have been observed in experiments ( e.g. type i , ii or iii elms ) which may actually be caused by different instability mechanisms @xcite . ``",
    "type iii '' elm observations show a remarkable similarity to global bursts found in computations of drift - wave turbulence , where the turbulence generated flows and fluxes are closely tied to the self - consistent equilibrium evolution in the plasma edge @xcite .",
    "`` type i '' elms in the experiment specifically show stronger magnetic activity during the burst and are usually associated with the onset of a magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) ideal ballooning mode ( ibm ) instability when a threshold pressure gradient is reached in the steep edge pedestal of an h - mode plasma @xcite .",
    "the possible role of an additional current driven instability ( `` peeling - ballooning mode '' ) for `` type i '' elms has also received recent interest @xcite .",
    "the ideal ballooning instability with nonlinear phases or aftermath has provided a paradigm for recent and current study of the elm phenomenon theoretically . explosive mhd instability and associated critical phenomena",
    "have been advanced analytically @xcite .",
    "early braginskii fluid simulations were given in support of this @xcite .",
    "large , nonlinear mhd codes have been studying this in more detail , resolving several numerical problems and paying specific attention to the details of the magnetic geometry , with mixed results on the phenomenology of the instability beyond its linear phase @xcite .",
    "whether or not the ideal ballooning instability or its peeling / ballooning variant is actually responsible for elms occuring in experiments ( here noting the absence of a demonstrably well - resolved l - to - h mode transition in computations from first principles ) , the nonlinear phase of this `` ideal mhd blowout '' or `` ibm blowout '' phenomenon is of physical interest .",
    "the ability of the instability to destroy the edge pedestal layer is undisputed , and the term `` blowout '' is germane .",
    "typical physical parameters lead to a situation wherein the ideal mhd interchange growth rate is comparable to the parallel alfvn transit time , one and the same with the basic ideal ballooning criterion .",
    "this is fast with respect to mhd but not to microturbulence .",
    "provided they can simultaneously treat global mhd ( i.e. , the spectrum covers both global and ion gyroradius scales ) , edge - turbulence computations can also address the phenomenon and are even in a position to treat parts of it which fall outside the paradigm of the mhd model .",
    "here we present nonlinear gyrofluid computations of ibm blowout events localised to the edge / sol region of a tokamak plasma , resolved to below the ion gyroradius @xmath0 . as in the large mhd models",
    "the self - consistent evolution of the equilibrium is not only included but is also an integral part of the dependent variables .",
    "an electromagnetic 6-moment gyro - fluid model ( `` gemr '' ) for both electrons and ions is used , including an energy - conserving treatment of finite ion larmor radius effects and higher - moment terms which occur in the toroidal drift @xcite .",
    "the energetic consistency is a key feature since the reaction of parts of the system such as flows and currents which have low energy content can play a central role in the indirect nature of nonlinear dynamics by serving as transfer channels .",
    "although the gyrofluid model has a different formulation of nonlinear polarisation ( the generalisation of `` vorticity '' to a two - fluid setting ) than a fluid or mhd model , full correspondence in the regime of validity of the latter models has been shown @xcite . in this sense",
    "the model is a superset of global reduced mhd and electromagnetic microturbulence .",
    "the global dynamics is in the reduced mhd regime @xcite due to low absolute edge beta values ( @xmath1 ) but the small scales depend on treating the ion gyroradius to arbitrary order .",
    "the model does not assume instabilities to occur at any particular scale , but when they occur the resulting spread of the spectrum is found to reach @xmath0 within a few eddy turnover times of the onset of nonlinearity in every case computed .",
    "the work reported herein addressed the following points .",
    "the relationship of the mhd dynamics to the ideal threshold is much discussed but in the gyrofluid model several mechanisms of microinstability are also present .",
    "the threshold issue is obscured by the existence of ion temperature gradient ( itg ) drift instabilities at all beta values , with a smooth transition between them .",
    "nevertheless , varying character in the saturation phases is observed at different values .",
    "we also address the issue of possible `` rho - star '' dependence ( here the local rho - star is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is @xmath0 evaluated at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the scale length of the @xmath6 profile , both evaluated at the mid - pedestal location in minor radius ) which would indicate a role for diamagnetic drifts .",
    "the gradient is sufficiently steep that @xmath7 so that none of these effects can be ordered small .",
    "we examine the necessary resolution to obtain converged cases , which gives the spectral range actively involved in nonlinear saturation .",
    "the main instability at experimentally relevant beta is the ideal ballooning instability but the main saturation process is energy exchange with broadband electromagnetic drift wave / itg turbulence which the instability itself generates .",
    "due mostly to this , the results turn out to be outside of both the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) and collisional braginskii paradigms , on which most previous approaches have been based . on the other hand ,",
    "the gemr model still uses delta - f equations , so the actual profile phenomenology in the sol region is not well represented , and as in other work with gemr we concentrate on the properties of the nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "following sections give the details of the gemr model , a discussion of the physical difference between itg and mhd dynamics and their relative roles , the methods used to pre - set the axisymmetric equilibrium state so that the computations are done in the absence of axisymmetric oscillations whose decay times can be slower than the ibm rise time , the computations of the blowout phase itself , and the possibility and limitations of quantitative comparison to experiment .",
    "the gyrofluid model used herein is given in ref .",
    "it is based on the original derivations given in refs.@xcite , with corrections given as motivated by free energy conservation .",
    "an alternative derivation using the conservation laws of the underlying gyrokinetic model is given in ref.@xcite .",

    "the operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 and the nonlinear brackets are determined by the representation of the geometry that is used .    the magnetic geometry is a simplified representation of an axisymmetric magnetic field using field aligned hamada coordinates .",
    "the field representation is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the physical toroidal angle about the symmetry axis , @xmath90 is the magnetic flux function , and @xmath91 is given by the constraint of mhd equilibrium .",
    "without loss of generality one may define magnetic flux coordinates @xmath92 with the following properties , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the volume enclosed by the surface with flux @xmath90 , then @xmath95 and @xmath96 are two further flux functions found , and the subscript denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath97 .",

    "then @xmath106 is found @xmath107 where the angle brackets give the flux surface average defined as @xmath108 now , @xmath109 is also defined and the toroidal angle coordinate is given by @xmath110 which completes the prescription .    the field aligning is a one - to - one and onto coordinate transform from @xmath92 to @xmath111 given by @xmath112 where @xmath8 is a reference minor radius and @xmath113 is an arbitrary function of @xmath114 which is chosen to make the off diagonal perpendicular metric element @xmath115 vanish at a particular location .",
    "this is called the shifted metric procedure @xcite .",
    "the point is that at any position in @xmath116 where perpendicular drifts or @xmath86 is evaluated , the coordinate elements are rectangular , and the information contained in magnetic shear enters only in derivatives in the parallel coordinate .",
    "the magnetic field components now satisfy @xmath117 at all locations in space for any choice of @xmath113 .",
    "hence although the perpendicular coordinate elements are rectangular only for one particular location in @xmath116 the field aligning is exactly satisfied everywhere .",
    "the coordinate metric elements @xmath118 are found in the @xmath92 representation .",
    "then the grid locations @xmath119 are all given their own members of the family of these field aligned coordinates via @xmath120 then we have @xmath121 at @xmath119 .",

    "with @xmath79 the electrostatic potential this gives the exb advection term , for electrons for which flr corrections are neglected by taking @xmath127 . for ions",
    "this is generalised by the flr corrections as given above .    for local equations as those used here (",
    "nonlinearities kept only in advection and magnetic flutter ) the geometry model must be modified to retain free energy conservation by the equations .",
    "in particular , any function of @xmath114 such as a radially varying normalised parameter ( such as the temperature / charge ration @xmath39 ) multiplying any of the curvature terms will cause them to fail to conserve free energy .",
    "the compressibility is already split away from advection and placed into the curvature terms , so the brackets must retain the properties of incompressible advection .",
    "this means that the model for @xmath128 which is used must satisfy @xmath129 and to avoid any confusion the curvature terms are written with @xmath130 , which can be given any spatial dependence .",
    "correspondingly , the mhd version of the continuity equation ( neglecting diamagnetic fluxes ) has already been manipulated according to @xmath131 @xmath132 and then terms such as @xmath133 are neglected due to the ordering .",
    "the result is the same as the local continuity equation @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a normalising constant , if we identify the dependent variable @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",

    "nonlinear computations on ideal or peeling ballooning mode elm scenarios in tokamaks have previously been based on magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models @xcite , and the respective codes had largely been tailored towards mode structures expected by linear analysis .",
    "restriction to single - fluid mhd equations including two - fluid correction terms allows computations of large to mesoscale dynamics in realistically shaped 2d tokamak equilibria including x - point geometry crossing the separatrix , due to the lack of a need to use field - aligned coordinates .",
    "recent mhd simulations are able to reproduce spatio - temporal mode structures , divertor footprints and other characteristics with good agreement to experimental diagnostics , in particular for the growth and immediate blowout phase of the finger - like instability @xcite .",
    "however , as soon as the dynamics becomes nonlinear , the spectrum broadens to include scales normally associated with drift wave dynamics .",
    "this turbulence is basically of a drift - alfvn type with strong edge itg character ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the signatures of the various mode structure types ) , made more powerful than otherwise by the energetic access to the long - wavelength mhd component .",
    "the itg character results from the steeper logarithmic gradients in both temperature profiles , and the lack of involvement of ion temperature fluctuations in the parallel nonadiabatic response of the electrons . although edge turbulence of this type ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is strongly suppressed in the h - mode phase and is not initially involved in the instability phase , the experience of edge turbulence becomes relevant as these physical components become involved in all the nonlinear phases of the blowout .",
    "the saturation and aftermath of the blowout , which in an experiment carries a large part of the actual transport losses that lead to a degradation of the pedestal , should be expected to involve physics not contained in the mhd model .",
    "ion temperature gradient ( itg ) driven modes and ideal ballooning modes are both essentially caused by the gradient and curvature driven interchange instability and show similar character in their initial linear growth phases .",
    "instability is achieved above their respective critical gradients , determined by the ratio @xmath143 between density gradient to ion temperature gradient scale lengths for itg , and by the ideal mhd ballooning parameter @xmath144 for ibm , where @xmath145 is the magnetic shear parameter and @xmath146 is a critical threshold which depends on beta , collisionality , and toroidicity . the principal difference between these modes is the relative role of the parallel alfvn responses which tend towards enforcement of an adiabatic response in the electrons ( parallel force balance , with the electron pressure gradient ) .",
    "this is nonexistent in an mhd model and subdominant generally for an mhd instabililty .",
    "but it constrains the electrons if the @xmath147 parameter is below threshold , still allowing the itg instability because the adiabatic response does not involve the ions .",
    "the itg instability exists at all @xmath147 values , and furthermore for the edge situation the itg instability and mode structure transitions smoothly to a drift wave one in a nonlinear setting for @xmath148 .",
    "hence there is actually no finite threshold in values of @xmath149 or @xmath147 for the nonlinear edge situation .",
    "therefore , the existence of a threshold in the experiment is the same as the mechanism which maintains the h - mode , which is not yet well understood .",
    "it follows that a gyrofluid model computation of an elm scenario with enough resolution to allow for ion - gyroradius based dynamics has to face the lack of a simple linear threshold in the parameter space .",
    "the transition from initial ( micro-)instabilities to generic edge turbulence was studied in detail in ref .",
    "as the most unstable linear modes crystallise out of an initial random bath of small - amplitude perturbations , the linear growth rate rises and becomes steady .",
    "the maximum value of the instantaneous growth rate of total fluctuation free energy @xmath150 given by @xmath151 may be taken as the maximal linear growth rate .",
    "the curve of @xmath152 then falls very sharply to zero ( over about @xmath153 ) as saturation occurs .",
    "there is some structural adjustment over the next few @xmath154 as the spectrum fills out , and then the turbulence is fully developed .",
    "but over the adjustment phase the value of @xmath155 is well below its previous maximum .",
    "we will use the same diagnostic herein , except that the total ion exb heat flux @xmath156 averaged over the computational domain is used instead of @xmath150 because most of @xmath150 is represented by the self consistent profiles while @xmath156 is entirely due to fluctuations .",
    "visualisation of the tokamak elm burst : the edge region of a circular poloidal tokamak cross - section is shown on the left with computational perpendicular @xmath116-domains ( @xmath157 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 of @xmath158 total ) mapped onto the circle during the maximum growth phase ( @xmath159 in units of @xmath9 ) of an ideal ballooning mode . on the right , the outer midplane area ( @xmath160 with size @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) is magnified and the radial domain stretched by a factor of 2 for better visibility at times @xmath159 ( max . flux ) and @xmath163 ( turbulent aftermath).,width=188 ]    the ibm elm blowout scenario is similar to this , initially , except that the instability is not a microinstability .",
    "nevertheless , the scale differs by less than an order of magnitude : the toroidal mode numbers for linear itg instabilities are in the range of @xmath164 while the main ideal ballooning mode is near mode number @xmath165 , on the entire flux surface , for these typical @xmath166 values ( recall @xmath167 for @xmath168 , and the ratio @xmath169 is not far from unity in experimental cases ) .",
    "the itg mode numbers are determined by the ion gyroradius and the dimensionless scale ratio @xmath170 , while the mhd values are determined by the width of the pedestal .",
    "since @xmath5 is not larger than about @xmath171 in an h - mode pedestal , these scales are not disparate .",
    "due to the closeness of the native scales , the ibm instability very quickly transfers energy to the ion gyroradius scale , which is only about two or three steps away in a turbulence cascade which acts at a factor of two at each step .",
    "this brings the itg and drift alfvn physics into play , and in any nonlinear stages the latter involves stable shear alfvn component with substantial energy content .",
    "the moment of saturation is defined as the time at which the ion exb heat flux averaged over the computational domain is maximum ; we refer to this as the `` peak - flux '' time .",
    "the results shown below indicate that coincides with the establishment of the fully turbulent regime .",
    "representation of this phase requires resolution of all scales and inclusion of the appropriate drift wave physics in the model .",
    "how much resolution is actually needed depends on the strength of the blowout , which is situation dependent .",
    "we therefore include a resolution scan on the toroidal mode number spectrum .",
    "the result is that convergence is reached in the temporal phases just after peak flux only if the spectrum reaches down to @xmath172 .",
    "the self - consistent equilibrium coupling in our gyrofluid model only allows treatment of shifted circular @xmath173 geometry ( the difference to mhd codes is that the high - resolution flr - gyrofluid dynamics necessitates field - aligned coordinates ) .",
    "effects of flux surface shaping are postponed to later studies .",
    "our focus here is on basic physics issues regarding the ability of the model to capture mhd phenomena ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite concerning global alfvn oscillations with self consistent profiles ) , resolution , turbulent character , scalings and tests which are also accessible by @xmath173 geometry .",
    "in particular , the theory of explosive instability has been formulated for circular geometry @xcite and is therefore accessible by the present model .",
    "first - principles based local drift wave edge turbulence simulations are not able to obtain a realistic h - mode edge state with the known experimental characteristics : correct density and temperature pedestal profiles shapes or strength of flow shear are not obtained by self - consistent evolution by specifying core sources only , nor has a threshold transition character been found in any verified edge turbulence simulation @xcite . therefore some kind of `` modelling '' has to take place when the ibm instability ( as an h - mode phenomenon ) and its subsequent nonlinear evolution is simulated with a nonlinear gyrofluid turbulence code : although the realistic development of an edge transport barrier ( and thus a full elm cycle ) can not be directly obtained , one still may prescribe the h - mode pedestal profile before the onset of an elm , known from experimental data , as an initial state for the simulation . as a base case for the prescribed pedestal profiles",

    "then , the resolution is increased to the nominal values ( @xmath224 ) , and a random turbulent bath with relative amplitude @xmath225 is added to the background pedestal profiles inside the closed flux surface region .",
    "this procedure reduces transient alfvnic and geodesic acoustic ringing and prepares a reproducible initial state .",
    "however , the following sudden release of the nonlinearities also leads to transient oscillations . depending on parameters , these may still be present at the onset of the instabilities , and can obscure a clean view on the nonlinear growth rates , which will be relevant for the discussion below on diagnosing linear or explosive instability .    a schematic sketch of the equilibrium pedestal profiles , representing an idealised asdex upgrade h - mode scenario @xcite , is shown in fig .",

    "subsequent evolution involves turbulence in both the pedestal and sol regions as the original pedestal energy is dissipated .",
