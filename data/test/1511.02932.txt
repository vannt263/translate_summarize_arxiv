    "almost two decades ago , a @xmath1 expansion of the chiral lagrangian for baryons was proposed @xcite to analyze the low - energy dynamics of baryons interacting with pseudoscalar mesons in a combined expansion in chiral symmetry breaking and @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the number of color charges . since then , many static properties of baryons have been successfully studied , namely , flavor-@xmath2 baryon mass splittings @xcite , axial - vector couplings @xcite , magnetic moments @xcite , and more recently , vector couplings @xcite . on general grounds ,",
    "the theoretical expressions obtained in those analyses agree well with data , providing strong evidence that the combined chiral and @xmath1 expansions work well for baryons .",
    "a comprehensive study of the static properties of baryons has led to a better understanding of their fundamental structure .",
    "accounting for the finite size of baryons , which is a consequence of the confinement of quarks inside a finite spatial volume , still represents a challenge for hadron physics research .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is indeed a unique tool to probe the size of baryons ( and mesons , of course ) via scattering processes .",
    "the analysis of the electromagnetic scattering of particles with internal structure introduces the concept of electromagnetic form factors , which describe the spatial distribution of the charge and magnetization density in the baryons .    in particular",
    ", the study of the neutron intrinsic charge radius is a uniquely interesting task .",
    "although the neutron is electrically neutral , it is composed of charged quarks so it may have an internal charge distribution . in that case",
    ", the neutron will undergo electrostatic interactions with other charged particles such as electrons .",
    "experimentally , electron - neutron scattering has been so far the only reliable method of determining the value and sign of the intrinsic radius of the electric - charge distribution in the neutron .",
    "an extraction of this static property from electron - deuteron scattering is not very reliable because of difficulties implicit to the deuteron structure .",
    "indeed , the authors of ref .  @xcite suggest the value @xmath3 .",
    "the negative sign may be explained in different approaches .",
    "the simplest explanation is provided by the su(6 ) quark model which predicts a vanishing electric form factor and , hence , a vanishing mean - square charge radius @xcite .",
    "su(6 ) symmetry is broken by the spin - dependent quark interaction , which is responsible for the @xmath4-@xmath5 mass splitting ; the interaction would then pull the up - quark to the center of the neutron and push the down - quarks to the edge , which would result in a nonzero electric charge form factor and , consequently , into a negative mean - square charge radius @xcite . in another approach based on the quark model",
    ", it is assumed that there is a repulsion between quarks with parallel spins , so the quark orbits are slightly distorted .",
    "this results into a slightly negative surface and a slightly positive center because the down - quarks are a bit farther from the center than the up - quark so the charges will not cancel at each distance from the center @xcite .    over the years",
    ", the electromagnetic structure of baryons has been studied analytically within several frameworks .",
    "an important selection of such frameworks can be found in the quark model and its variants ( nonrelativistic , relativistic , chiral ) @xcite , the @xmath1 expansion @xcite , and chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to assess the success of the many calculations of corrections to the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "predictions that vary substantially from one another are obtained .",
    "lattice qcd , on the other hand , has made great inroads into the subject by evaluating from first principles the qcd contribution to the baryon charge @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations directly at the physical pion mass are becoming available , so eventually chiral extrapolations will not be needed and one source of systematic uncertainty will be eliminated .    in this paper , the formalism of the @xmath1 expansion combined with heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory will be used to compute the one - loop corrections to the dirac form factor . as a byproduct , the baryon charge radii will also be studied .",
    "the analysis builds on earlier works , particularly refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , where the magnetic moment and baryon axial and vector couplings , respectively , have been obtained .",
    "however , since the same approach used in these references will be followed here , much of the work has already been advanced .",
    "therefore , the su(3 ) breaking corrections to the dirac form factor will be given at the leading order of the breaking , which is order @xmath6 .",
    "this is not a drawback , though , because the analysis will be useful to envisage a more refined calculation to order @xmath7 , as it has already been dealt with , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the context of some variants of chiral perturbation theory ( relativistic , quenched , and covariant ) .",

    "in the limit of exact flavor su(3 ) symmetry , the hadronic weak vector and axial - vector currents belong to su(3 ) octets , so the form factors of different baryon semileptonic decays ( bsd ) are related by su(3 ) flavor symmetry and are given in terms of a few effective form factors and some well - known clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the weak currents and the electromagnetic current are members of the same su(3 ) octet , so all the vector form factors of bsd are related at @xmath42 to the electric charges and the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons .    at @xmath42 ,",
    "the baryon matrix elements for the vector current are given by the matrix elements of the associated charge or su(3 ) generator .",
    "the flavor octet baryon charge , @xmath45 , is spin-0 and a flavor octet , so it transforms as @xmath46 under su(2)@xmath47su(3 ) .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath45 between su(6 ) symmetric states yield the values of the leading vector form factor @xmath48 of bsd . the flavor index @xmath49 is simply set to @xmath50 and @xmath51 for strangeness - conserving and strangeness - changing weak decays , respectively .    on the other hand , su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in @xmath45 have been analyzed using the @xmath1 expansion @xcite and the combined chiral and @xmath1 expansions @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the computation was performed at one - loop level and the full result to order @xmath6 in the chiral expansion was achieved . some variants of chiral perturbation theory ( relativistic , covariant ) , with or without decuplet baryon degrees of freedom ,",
    "have been used to approach the problem to the next order , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "now , in order to tackle the dirac form factor in the combined chiral and @xmath1 expansion also to @xmath6 , the method proposed in ref .  @xcite will be followed .",
    "one might naively think that setting the flavor index @xmath49 of the one - loop correction @xmath52 to @xmath53 will work .",
    "however , the matter is not quite that simple .",
    "although in the large-@xmath0 limit the baryon vector couplings have the same kinematic properties as the electromagnetic form factors and can be written in terms of the same operators , some subtleties will arise .",
    "the operator giving rise to the dirac form factor is thus a scalar that does not change either the electric charge or the strangeness ; it connects states with the same @xmath54 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and even it can connect states with different @xmath55 , keeping the other quantum numbers unchanged . at @xmath42 , it must reduce to the baryon electric charge .",
    "thus , at zero recoil , the dirac form factor is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the charge matrix for the three light quarks @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",

    "similarly , @xmath65 will stand for @xmath66 so any operator of the form @xmath67 should be understood as @xmath68 .    at one - loop level , the dirac form factor will get corrections arising from the feynman graphs depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : oneloop ] .",
    "these graphs can be written as the product of a baryon operator times a flavor tensor that comprises the loop integrals , which in turn contain the full dependence on @xmath69 .",

    "will be saved by borrowing those operator structures that are applicable and adaptable to the present case ; the remaining ones will be analyzed accordingly .",
    "nevertheless , the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite will be the starting point .",
    "the individual contributions are described in the following section .",
    "the one - loop correction [ fig : oneloop](a ) for the dirac form factor can be written as @xmath72 where the axial vector current operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 are used at the meson - baryon vertices , @xmath75 is the spin projection operator for spin @xmath76 @xcite so the baryon propagator turns out to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 stands for the difference of the hyperfine mass splitting between the intermediate baryon with spin @xmath76 and the external baryon , specifically , @xmath79 in eq .",

    "the su(3 ) invariant couplings used are those obtained on an equal footing from the analyses of baryon magnetic moments @xcite and axial and vector couplings @xcite . as a result ,",
    "some patterns emerge : first , all @xmath129 corresponding to neutral baryons lie around zero , which is consistent with @xmath130 . in other words",
    ", such particles can emit virtual photons and possess a charge distribution , which would explain these nonvanishing charge radii .",
    "second , the @xmath129 of both octet and decuplet charged baryons reveal an apparent hierarchy and therefore they are concentrated in two well - defined narrow bands , the one for decuplet baryons lying higher than its counterpart for octet baryons .",
    "this is a reasonable result because one would expect that decuplet baryons be more extended in space than octet baryons .    at a glance ,",
    "the entries of table [ t : crpre ] indicate that the different contributions that make up @xmath129 are indeed as expected from the large-@xmath0 and chiral countings .",
    "loop contributions are as important as tree - level ones .",
    "in particular , for the neutron , there is a large cancellation between the @xmath131 and the one - loop terms so that @xmath132 gets most of its value from @xmath133 ( here @xmath133 corresponds , up to normalization factor , to the so - called foldy term defined for the nucleon ) .",
    "this term is also responsible , in the present approach , for a nonzero @xmath134 , which otherwise would vanish .",
    "the total values of @xmath129 for scenario ( b ) of table [ t : crpre ] can be compared with some other results presented in the literature .",
    "unfortunately , most papers are focused to either octet or decuplet baryons so it is quite hard to assess the success of the different calculations .",
    "there is a single paper @xcite that provides values of charge radii for both octet and decuplet baryons in the context of the constituent chiral quark model . by comparing the different values , the agreement observed is very good on general grounds , except for the fact that @xmath135 is roughly one third of the value reported here .",
    "this is worrisome , especially because a recent lattice simulation @xcite found @xmath136 for a pion mass or around @xmath137 , which is far from the prediction reported here .",
    "the numerical analysis was performed using the measured mean - square charge radii of @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . in scenario ( b ) , the first two values are well reproduced whereas the latter , within the experimental error , is fairly well reproduced .",
    "if this @xmath141 from lattice were also included as data in the fit , the @xmath142 would be too high to represent an output with a coherent physical content .",
    "systematic lower values of @xmath129 are also observed in recent theoretical works in the context of a manifest covariant effective field theory @xcite and a covariant bethe - salpeter approach @xcite .    within the combined approach , corrections from tree ,",
    "one - loop and counterterms are under reasonable control and are in accord with expectations from the quiral and @xmath1 countings .",
    "the predictions , however , are not the ultimate in the sense that more theoretical work is required to incorporate @xmath7 contributions .",
    "this represents a formidable task and will be attempted in the near future .",
    "adding this contribution , perhaps , could remedy the discrepancy observed in @xmath141 .",
    "of course , new or improved data will be also welcome in the near future .",
    "in this paper the dirac form factors and consequently the mean - square charge radii of baryons have been computed at one - loop level in a combined formalism in chiral and @xmath1 corrections to order @xmath6 in the usual chiral counting . the @xmath1 chiral effective lagrangian for the lowest - lying baryons was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and describes the interactions of the spin-@xmath143 baryon octet and the spin-@xmath144 baryon decuplet with the pion nonet .",
    "this formalism has been applied successfully to other baryon static properties , particularly magnetic moments @xcite and axial and vector couplings @xcite . for the dirac form factor ,",
    "much of the work already advanced in the latter reference could be borrowed and adapted to the present analysis .",
    "the dirac form factors were thus constructed at one - loop level plus tree - level contributions that play a crucial role in the analysis . by working to order @xmath6 in the chiral counting and practically at all orders in the @xmath1 expansion , it was possible to write the final expressions in terms of the su(3 ) invariant couplings @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 introduced in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these couplings , along with the anomalous magnetic moments , are the necessary inputs to find the charge radii unambiguously .",
    "two possible sets of couplings are used here .",
    "one set is dictated by su(6 ) symmetry and the other set , which has a better physical content , is obtained on the same footing as in the present paper @xcite .",
    "the former case , referred to as scenario ( a ) here , yielded a quite poor fit . as a result , the charge radii were also poorly determined .",
    "in contrast , the latter case , referred to as scenario ( b ) , yielded a good fit with very good predictions for charge radii .    in passing ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that several relations among dirac form factors and charge radii found in the literature are also nicely fulfilled with the results presented here .",
    "this provided an extra cross - check .",
    "the decuplet - octet mass difference has been taken into account , but neglected the su(3 ) splittings of the octet and decuplet baryons . the combined formalism to order @xmath6 represents a first step towards a more refined calculation where these splittings can be included to the next order , @xmath7 .",
    "this inclusion , however , requires a non - negligible effort .",
