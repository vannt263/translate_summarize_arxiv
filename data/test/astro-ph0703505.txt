    "the potential importance of the photon - photon pair production process , @xmath1 , in high energy astrophysics has been realized for over 40 years @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that owing to interactions with the 2.7 k cmb , the universe would be opaque to @xmath0-rays of energy above 100 tev at extragalactic distances @xcite .",
    "if one considers cosmological and redshift effects , it was further shown that photons from a @xmath0-ray source at a redshift @xmath2 would be significantly absorbed by pair production interactions with the cmb above an energy @xmath3 tev @xcite .    following the discovery by the _ egret _ team of the strongly flaring @xmath0-ray blazar 3c279 at redshift 0.54 @xcite , stecker , de jager and salamon @xcite proposed that one can use the predicted pair production absorption features in blazars to determine the intensity of the infrared portion of the ibl , provided that the intrinsic spectra of blazars extends to tev energies .",
    "it was later shown that the ibl produced by stars in galaxies at redshifts out to @xmath4 would make the universe opaque to photons above an energy of @xmath5 gev emitted by sources at a redshift of @xmath6 , again owing to pair production interactions @xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    "this approach was expanded by using recent data from the _ spitzer _ infrared observatory the _ hubble _ deep survey and _ galex _ to determine the photon density of the ibl from 0.03 ev to the lyman limit at 13.6 ev for redshifts out to 6 ( the `` archeo - ibl '' ) .",
    "the results , giving the ibl photon density as a function of redshift together with the opacity of the cmb as a function of redshift , were then used to calculate the opacity of the universe to @xmath0-rays for energies from 4 gev to 100 tev and for redshifts from @xmath7 to 5 .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in figure 1 .",
    "they are given for two evolution models , _ viz .",
    "_ , the `` baseline '' ( b ) model and the `` fast evolution '' ( fe ) model .",
    "these two models were chosen to bracket the plausible history of the star formation rates in galaxies which is the input which has the largest uncertainty in the calculation , particularly at the higher redshifts .",
    "the fe model is favored by recent _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "it also provides a better description of the deep _ spitzer _ number counts at 70 and 160@xmath8 m than the b model .",

    "galex _ uv observations _ vs. _ that obtained from the _ spitzer _ ir observations is that the effect of dust extinction followed by ir reradiation increases with redshift @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that tev @xmath0-ray observations of the blazars 1es1101 - 232 and h 2356 - 309 place an upper limit on the present ibl of @xmath9 nw m@xmath10sr@xmath11 in the wavelength range 12 @xmath8 m @xcite , based on the assumption that the intrinsic photon spectra of these sources in the energy range of observation can not have a spectral index which is flatter than 1.5 .",

    "@xcite predict that the universe will become opaque to @xmath0-rays for sources at the higher redshifts at somewhat lower @xmath0-ray energies than those given in ref .",
