    "the quantum beats are in phase , regardless of the path and speed of the atom .",
    "averaging trajectories with the same visibility does not change the final result .",
    "the visibility of the quantum beats is maximal and constant for a weak drive .",
    "increasing the drive strength brings a decrease in the visibility and an increased decay rate of the oscillations . given a photon detection at @xmath52 , the probability for detecting the very next photon still exhibits quantum beats ; however , uncorrelated photons contribute at longer delays .",
    "these , for example , might come from the repeated absorption and emission of @xmath136- and @xmath85-polarized photons , respectively ; such events reinitialize the quantum beat with altered phase ; higher drive strength increases their number and decreases the visibility .",
    "also , spontaneous emission into modes other than those of the cavity may cause decay from @xmath13 to the ground state without providing a heralding photon in the undriven cavity mode . following such an emission , the atom might be reexcited and returned to @xmath12 , now emitting a photon into the undriven cavity mode .",
    "this photon , not being preceded by a correlated `` start '' , further diminishes the visibility .",
    "when the driving is sufficiently weak , the number of uncorrelated detections approaches zero and maximum visibility is obtained .    to ensure that the decay of the quantum beats is due to the transit of the atom across the cavity rather than a strong drive , our model shows , for the parameters used , that the number of photons inside the cavity must be less than approximately four times the saturation photon number .",
    "we have also verified that so long as any detuning between the @xmath0 atomic transition ( or the drive ) and the cavity frequency is smaller than the cavity width , the frequency of the quantum beats is unaltered .",
    "furthermore , for a weak drive , unequal zeeman shifts in the ground and excited states ( @xmath137 ) do not significantly alter the quantum beat frequency ; it reflects the larmor frequency of the ground state .",
    "of more concern from an experimental point of view is the possible presence of birefringence in the cavity .",
    "this works as a direct coupling between its two orthogonally polarized modes .",
    "we model it by introducing such a coupling term in the system hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : hamiltoniano ] ) ] .",
    "the most important differences that this modeling shows are the disappearance of the antibunching around @xmath52 and a change of the quantum beat frequency from twice the larmor frequency to the larmor frequency itself .",
    "the frequency change occurs when the field generated by birefringence is approximately half the undriven field generated by the atom .",
    "a final important issue is the effect of two or more atoms in the cavity at a time .",
    "a thorough treatment is reserved for future work .",
    "we have , however , obtained some preliminary indications . restricting the atomic basis to @xmath129- atom symmetric states , we find , in the limit of weak driving and for the parameters used throughout this paper , that neither the frequency nor duration of the quantum beats depends on @xmath129 .",
    "this follows because the underlying beat mechanism is independent of @xmath129 .",
    "we have shown in this paper that a cavity qed system comprising two orthogonally polarized modes coupled to an atom with magnetic structure shows robust quantum beats at twice the larmor frequency of the atomic ground state .",
    "the beats are only visible through conditional measurement of the intensity of the undriven mode , _",
    "i.e. _ , as photon correlations .",
    "they allow for control and feedback of ground state superpositions created on the detection of a spontaneously emitted `` start '' photon .",
    "realistic experiments have been proposed which can be implemented in current realizations of cavity qed in the optical regime .",
    "they open a path to new quantum error correction protocols and also a new class of quantum feedback and control .",
