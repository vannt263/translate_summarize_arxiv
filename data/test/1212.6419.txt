    "the study of films of highly quantal fluids , such as helium , is motivated by the search for novel phases of matter in confinement and/or reduced dimensions .",
    "indeed , an experimentally controllable way of making quasi-2d interacting @xmath0he systems is to adsorb a thin film of @xmath0he on a substrate . on weakly attractive substrates , such as those of some alkali metals , @xmath0he forms superfluid films ( down to a monolayer @xcite thin ) whose thickness smoothly increases with chemical potential , with no evidence of layering.@xcite on the other hand , on stronger substrates adsorption occurs through the formation of successive , well - defined layers ( up to seven on graphite ) , with essentially no quantum - mechanical atomic exchanges taking place between the first few adjacent adlayers .",
    "the phase diagram on these substrates is richer , displaying a variety of phases , including crystalline ones , either commensurate or incommensurate with the underlying substrate .",
    "+ crowell and reppy  @xcite raised some time ago the possibility of a  supersolid \" phase,@xcite characterized by simultaneous density and superfluid long - range order , in the vicinity of a possible crystalline phase of the second helium adlayer , registered with the underlying graphite substrate .",
    "this contention has recently been reiterated .",
    "@xcite the most reliable , first - principle numerical studies of helium films on graphite have yielded no evidence of such a phase , as no registered crystal is observed in the second adlayer .",
    "@xcite + graphene ( a single sheet of graphite ) has also been theoretically considered as a possible substrate for helium adsorption , and the phase diagram of the adsorbate in the low temperature ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) limit has been computed by means of different numerical techniques.@xcite a single sheet of carbon atoms is somewhat less attractive than a graphite substrate .",
    "quantitatively , the atomic binding energy for the first @xmath0he adlayer is reduced by approximately 10% ( about 13.4 k ) compared to graphite .",
    "one might imagine that the energy offset could lead to different physical behavior , but first principle calculations suggest that a difference of that order of magnitude in the adsorption potential is likely to have little or no effect on the phase diagram of helium on graphite .",
    "@xcite thus , one may expect no qualititative differences in the phase diagram of @xmath0he adsorbed on graphene versus that on graphite .",
    "indeed , that is the conclusion at which most numerical studies carried out so far for this system have arrived , with an outstanding puzzle concerning a possible superfluid response in the first adsorbed layer , near and at commensurate filling , reported in refs . .",
    "+ we report in this article results of a theoretical study of the low temperature phase diagram of @xmath0he adsorbed on graphene , based on computer simulations .",
    "we consider here a system comprising at least twice as many @xmath0he atoms than in previous studies by others , the goal being that of attempting a reliable extrapolation of the physics of the system in the thermodynamic limit",
    ". the main findings of our study are largely in line with most previous works on graphene , but with no evidence of any `` supersolid '' phase , neither in the second nor in the first adsorbed layer . + the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : first , we briefly discuss the model of the system that is used , as well as the computational methodology ; then , we proceed with the illustration of the results , focusing on the first and second adlayers .",
    "we summarize our main results in the conclusions , where we also address issues that may be the subject of future work .",
    "in order to study numerically the physical properties of @xmath0he on a graphene sheet , we performed equilibrium , large - scale computer simulations of a model of the system of interest , using the continuous - space worm algorithm .",
    "@xcite graphene is modeled as an ideal , two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , with a carbon - carbon bond length @xmath5=1.42  .",
    "carbon atoms are treated as fixed particles in our simulation , an assumption justified by their relatively large mass , compared to that of the @xmath0he atoms .",
    "the system is enclosed in a three - dimensional cell , shaped as a parallelepiped ; the graphene sheet is aligned parallel to the @xmath6 plane ( at @xmath7=0 ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in all directions , but the box is sufficiently elongated in the @xmath7 direction to make the boundary condition immaterial .",
    "the ensuing , quantum - mechanical many - body hamiltonian is the following : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the @xmath0he atoms , @xmath10 is a pairwise potential describing the interaction between two helium atoms , whereas @xmath10 describes the interaction of each helium - carbon pair , with @xmath11 the position of a carbon atom .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath10 are assumed to depend only on the relative distance between two particles .",
    "the interaction between helium atoms @xmath10 is taken to be the accepted aziz pair potential , @xcite whereas for the carbon - helium potential @xmath12 a lennard - jones potential is used , with parameters @xmath13k and @xmath14 chosen following ref .  .",
    "the simulated systems comprise close to one thousand @xmath0he atoms . the largest honeycomb lattice simulated here",
    "has size 49.19  @xmath15 51.12   , and consists of 960 carbon atoms .",
    "all the simulations are performed in the grand canonical ensemble , at finite temperatures ranging from 0.5 k to 1.0 k. the results at the two different temperature differ very little , suggesting that they are essentially ground state estimates , at least as far as energetics and structures are concerned . finally , all the results presented here are independent of the initial atomic configuration utilized in the simulation .",
    "we start the discussion of our results with the first layer .",
    "fig.[fig : dens_mu_layer1 ] shows the computed average equilibrium @xmath0he coverage ( two - dimensional density ) as a function of chemical potential @xmath16 .    .winding number squared along @xmath17 and @xmath18 axis for @xmath19 @xmath0he atoms in the c1/3 phase . [",

    "[ picc7/16 ] . in some simulations",
    "a metastable liquid phase with a slightly higher value of the energy per atom was observed , which is typical for a first order transition .",
    "conceivably , such a phase might be seen in experiments.@xcite no evidence of a low - coverage thermodynamically stable superfluid ( which exists on a smooth , flat substrate@xcite ) is observed .",
    "+ the c1/3 crystal forms at a distance @xmath21 , with a full width at half maximum @xmath22 ( these numbers hold for the entire first layer ) , only slightly greater than that for graphite . the thermodynamic stability of the c1/3 phase is signaled by an extended plateau of the density as a function of @xmath16 , hinting at a large gap of about @xmath23 k in the spectrum and implying a zero superfluid response and zero compressibility .",
    "all of this is very similar to hardcore bosons on a lattice with long - range interactions and also to what is observed on graphite.@xcite however , ref .",
    "reports a very small ( less than 1% ) , but finite value of the superfluid fraction at @xmath24=0 , increasing to approximately 14% upon doping such phase with vacancies . assuming a kosterlitz - thouless scenario for the u(1 ) transition for the c1/3 phase , the transition temperature corresponding to the data of ref .",
    "corresponds to @xmath25mk . in tables  [ table:8x6 ] and table  [ table:8x8 ] we computed the superfluid properties of the c1/3 phase down to @xmath26mk for a system consisting of @xmath19 and @xmath27 @xmath0he atoms , respectively .",
    "we used @xmath28 times slices per inverse kelvin , except for the @xmath26mk case on the @xmath27 system where 160 slices per inverse kelvin were used because of limitations of computer memory .",
    "this led to a reduction of less than a percent on the kinetic energy .",
    "simulations were started with an initial superfluid . in tables  [ table:8x6 ] and  [ table:8x8 ] we see that all data are consistent with insulating behavior and a large gap of a few k in the c1/3 phase , which is consistent with the results of ref . .",
    "non - zero winding numbers are possible on our small system sizes ( ruling out ergodicity problems ) , but are a result of finite size effects and disappear exponentially with system size .",
    "in particular , at @xmath26mk a kosterlitz - thouless scenario would have predicted a strong superfluid response of the order of @xmath29 of the value reported in ref .",
    "( at @xmath30k ) .",
    "this is clearly not the case and we conclude that the diffusion monte carlo results of ref",
    ".   are irreproducible , prompting a critical and systematic analysis of the diffusion monte carlo methodology ( finite system size , influence of the trial wave function and finite population bias@xcite ) . with respect to the thermodynamic stability of commensurate phases doped with vacancies reported in refs .",
    ", the use of the grand - canonical ensemble employed here offers distinct advantages over other ensembles to find phase separation .    further increasing the chemical potential leads to the appearance of domain walls , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ picc7/16 ] , which first occur along one principal axis of the c1/3 phase .",
    "this phase is akin to striped phases , but with increasing chemical potential a proliferation of domain walls is observed , along more and more principal axes . in the thermodynamic limit , it has no superfluid response .",
    "this process stops when a commensurate crystalline phase labelled as c7/16 with a coverage of 0.0835  @xmath3 is formed , and which can be seen as every unit cell of the c1/3 phase being surrounded by domain walls .",
    "the c7/16 structure has a rhombic unit cell , with 7 @xmath0he atoms distributed over 16 absorption sites . for this commensurate structure , too",
    ", no finite superfluid signal is computed . fig .",
    "[ picc7/16 ] shows the @xmath0he density profile for the c7/16 phase observed in our large scale simulations .",
    "surprisingly , the helium atoms are in our case distributed more uniformly over the unit cell than in previous works .",
    "@xcite moreover , the structure is slightly rotated ( a comparison with the commensurate phases seen by others is shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] ) .",
    "we performed the simulation with a smaller system size ( the same as the one used in ref .  ) , and we also used as initial configuration one corresponding to the the density profile obtained in ref .  , but our monte carlo simulation still stabilized , after a sufficiently long time , to the same structure of higher symmetry inside the unit cell , shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the difference is not attributable to system size , nor is it a result of a specific choice of initial atomic configuration .",
    "+ the most likely reason for the difference between our and previous results is the modeling of the helium - carbon interaction . while we use here a two - body potential ( @xmath12 in eq .",
    "[ ham ] ) with fixed carbon positions , thereby retaining full rotational symmetry , previous studies made use of an external one - body potential obtained by summing anisotropic lennard - jones potentials proposed to fit helium scattering from graphite .",
    "the slightly different ways of accounting for corrugation may well be at the root of the lower symmetry structure found in previous studies , and this is supported by comparing the actual potentials felt at locations inside the unit cell , which differ between the two methods .",
    "+ on increasing @xmath16 even further , the c7/16 phase is replaced by an incommensurate , compressible solid phase , sketched in fig .  [ picc7/16 ] ( panel on the left in the bottom row ) .",
    "the density increases linearly with chemical potential until a density of 0.107(3 )  @xmath3 is reached where the first atoms in the second layer are found .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the one reported in ref .  , but lower than the one from gordillo _ et al .",
    "_ , namely 0.115  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is also lower than the corresponding one for a graphite substrate , either from theoretical calculations,@xcite namely 0.114  @xmath3 , or inferred from specific heat measurements,@xcite i.e. , 0.127  @xmath3 , something that can be attributed to the weaker substrate attraction .",
    "we now turn to the second layer . the first stable phase that we observe is a uniform liquid , which is superfluid at the temperature considered here ( fig .",
    "[ 2nd ] and fig .",
    "[ pic2nd ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium coverage is roughly 0.150 @xmath3 , consistent with the two - dimensional density of the superfluid being close to the equilibrium density of two - dimensional @xmath0he , _",
    "i.e. _ 0.043 @xmath3 .",
    "this superfluid phase has a relatively wide domain of existence , extending up to a layer density of @xmath31 @xmath3 . within the quoted statistical uncertainty ,",
    "this value is in agreement with that of ref . , and also consistent with that found on graphite,@xcite namely 0.076  @xmath3 .",
    "+ on raising the chemical potential , a first - order phase transition to an incommensurate crystal is observed , which persists up to atomic third layer promotion . the density profile of the incommensurate solid phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ pic2nd ] .",
    "its superfluid response is zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is qualitatively the same behavior observed for graphite ( see ref . ) .",
    "nowhere in the second layer are commensurate phases found , and in particular we find no evidence of any  supersolid \" phase . the arguments for the absence of the suggested c7/12 and c4/7 phases formulated in ref .   for graphite apply equally well for graphene .",
    "gordillo and boronat suggested that there could be a coexistence region between liquid and incommensurate phase.@xcite since the ( quantum ) transition between a liquid and solid where the substrate does not play a role has to be first order , such a region must be sought around @xmath32k in fig .",
    "we did not analyze this first order transition in more detail , since it was very narrow already in graphite .",
    "@xcite as a final remark , we note that the @xmath0he density between the layers is essentially zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , layers constitute distinct , effectively two - dimensional systems .",
    "we studied the phase diagram of the first and second layer of @xmath0he adsorbed on graphene . in the first layer",
    ", we find a very stable c1/3 phase , followed by a domain wall phase , a c7/16 phase and an incommensurate solid .",
    "this is the same as for graphite,@xcite and in line with previous studies.@xcite the only difference we observed consisted of the density distribution of the helium atoms inside the c7/16 unit cell , where we observed a small rotation ( and more symmetric ) distribution .",
    "we attribute this difference to the modeling of the carbon - helium interaction , which was done slightly differently than in previous studies : we used a fully rotationally symmetric two - body potential between carbon and helium atoms , and kept a ( classical ) hexagonal carbon lattice in the simulation , while previous studies used a one - body potential that could be isotropic or anisotropic .",
    "we neglected defects , disorder , and other lattice imperfections in the graphene .",
    "for the second layer , our results are also in line with the ones found on graphite  @xcite and previous studies showing a superfluid and an incommensurate solid at higher coverages .",
    "no commensurate structures are found , nor any supersolids .",
    "layer promotion occurs at a slightly lower chemical potential than for graphite , because of the slightly weaker helium - substrate potential .    in future work",
    ", we will study more realistic descriptions of graphene , which is not entirely flat but has intrinsic microscopic roughening .",
    "suspended graphene sheets under a transmission electron microscope were seen to have a surface normal varying by several degrees and the out of plane deformations reach 1 nm . @xcite this roughened structure is thought to suppress and stabilize thermal vibrations and to influence the behavior as an adsorbent .",
    "our setup can also be modified to study helium inside carbon nano - tubes : instead of using periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions on the graphene substrate , one could use periodic boundary conditions only in the @xmath17 direction .",
