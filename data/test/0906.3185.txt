    "a new class of massive x - ray binaries has been recognized in the last few years , mainly thanks to observations carried out with the _ integral _ satellite .",
    "they are transient x - ray sources associated to o or b supergiant stars and characterized by short outbursts . these _ supergiant fast x@xmath0ray transients _ ( sfxts ) [ @xcite ; @xcite ]",
    "are remarkably different from the classical high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) with supergiant companions , that are bright persistent sources , and also differ from the be transients for their optical companions and shorter outbursts .",
    "the outbursts of sfxts involve a high dynamic range , spanning 3 to 5 orders of magnitudes , from a quiescent luminosity of @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 up to the peak luminosity of @xmath3  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "the outbursts typically last a few days and are composed of many short flares with duration of a few hours . besides these bright outbursts",
    ", the sfxts can display a fainter flaring activity with luminosity @xmath4  erg  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sfxts properties ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) .",
    "@xcite , proposed that sfxts outbursts are due to the presence of an equatorial wind component , denser and slower than the spherically symmetric wind from the supergiant , and possibly inclined with respect to the orbital plane of the system .",
    "the enhanced accretion rate occurring when the neutron star crosses this wind component can explain sfxts showing periodic outbursts , such as igr  j11215@xmath05952 and also other sfxts , assuming different geometries for the outflowing equatorial wind .",
    "another possibility involves the gated mechanisms due to transitions across the centrifugal barrier @xcite.@xcite showed that a centrifugal or a magnetic barrier can explain the sfxts properties only if the supergiant wind is inhomogeneous , and the accreting neutron star has a strong magnetic field ( @xmath5  g ) and a long spin period ( @xmath6  s ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that the sfxts flares are produced by accretion of clumps of matter from the companion wind . in the framework of",
    "the clumpy wind model proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed that what distinguishes the sfxts from the persistent hmxbs with supergiant companions is their different orbital separation : in persistently bright sources the compact object orbits the companion at a small distance ( @xmath72 stellar radii ) where there is a high number density of clumps , while the transient emission in sfxts is produced by accretion of much rarer clumps present at larger distances . on the other hand",
    ", the monitoring with _ swift _ of a sample of four sfxts @xcite has demonstrated that these sources accrete matter also outside the bright outbursts , so any model should also account for this important observational property .",
    "the winds of o and b type stars are driven by the momentum transfer of the radiation field and @xcite showed that the dominant mechanism is the line scattering .",
    "the analytical formulation for line - driven winds has been developed by @xcite ( cak ) . in the cak theory",
    "the mass lost by the star is smoothly accelerated by the momentum transferred from the stellar continuum radiation , and forms a stationary and homogeneous wind .",
    "however , both observational evidence and theoretical considerations indicate that the stellar winds are variable and non homogeneous .",
    "changes in the uv line profiles , revealing wind variability , have been observed on time scales shorter than a day @xcite .",
    "the x - ray variability observed in 4u  1700@xmath0377 , vela  x@xmath01 and other hmxbs can be explained in terms of wind inhomogeneity [ @xcite ; @xcite ] and further indications for the presence of clumps come from x@xmath0ray spectroscopy .",
    "for example , the x@xmath0ray spectrum of vela  x@xmath01 during the eclipse phase shows recombination lines produced by a hot ionized gas and fluorescent k - shell lines produced by cool and dense gas of near - neutral ions @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed that the coexistence of highly ionized and near neutral ions can be explained with an inhomogeneous wind , where cool , dense clumps are embedded in a lower density , highly ionized medium .",
    "@xcite suggested that the wind acceleration is subject to a strong instability since small perturbations in the velocity or density distribution grow with time producing a variable and strongly structured wind .",
    "the first time - dependent hydrodynamical simulations of unstable line - driven winds were performed by @xcite and , more recently , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all these simulations show that the line - driven instability produces a highly structured wind , with reverse and forward shocks that compress the gas into clumps .",
    "moreover , the shock heating can generate a hot inter - clump medium into which the colder clumps are immersed @xcite .    based on these considerations",
    ", we study in this work the expected variability and x@xmath0ray luminosity properties of neutron stars accreting from a clumpy wind . in the next two sections",
    "we describe our clumpy wind model and the assumptions for the mass accretion . in section",
    "[ application of the clumpy wind model ] we study the dependence of the parameters introduced in the previous sections . in sections",
    "[ study of the hmxb vela x-1 ] , [ study of the sgxb 4u 1700 - 377 ] and [ study of the sfxt igr j11215 - 5952 ] we compare the x - ray light curves predicted with our model to the observations of three high mass x - ray binaries , showing that it is possible to reproduce well the observed flaring behaviors .",
    "in our model , where the dynamical problem has not been treated , we assume that a fraction of the stellar wind is in form of clumps with a power law mass distribution    @xmath8    in the mass range @xmath9 - @xmath10 .",
    "the rate of clumps produced by the supergiant is related to the total mass loss rate @xmath11 by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fraction of mass lost in clumps and @xmath14 is the average clump mass , which can be computed from equation ( [ npunto ] ) .",
    "clumps are driven radially outward by absorption of uv spectral lines @xcite . from spectroscopic observations of o stars ,",
    "@xcite suggest that clumps follow on average the same velocity law of a smooth stellar wind",
    ". we can then assume the following clump velocity profile without solving the dynamical problem : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the terminal wind velocity , @xmath17 is the radius of the supergiant , @xmath18 is a parameter which ensures that @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath20 is a constant in the range @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "assuming that the clumps are confined by the ram pressure of the ambient gas , their size can be derived by the balance pressure equation .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the average density of a clump is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density profile of the homogeneous ( inter - clump ) wind , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the inter - clump wind and the clump thermal velocity , respectively : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the temperatures of the inter - clump wind and of the clumps , respectively , and @xmath33 is the mean atomic weight .",
    "the constant @xmath34 accounts for the confining effect of the bow shock produced by the ram pressure around the clump @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is the relative velocity between the wind and the clump ( @xmath36 ) . adopting @xmath37  cm  s@xmath2 , @xmath38  k , @xmath39  k and @xmath40",
    ", we obtain : @xmath41 since the density radial profile @xmath25 of the homogeneous inter - clump wind ( obtained from the continuity equation @xmath42 ) is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a generic distance from the supergiant , from equations ( [ lucy_white ] ) , ( [ lucy_white_200 ] ) , ( [ legge_densita_vento_omogeneo ] ) , we obtain : @xmath45 where @xmath46 . @xcite",
    "analyzed the far - ultraviolet spectrum of o - type supergiants and found that clumping starts deep in the wind , just above the sonic point @xmath47 , at velocity @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 . in the cak model the sonic point is defined as the point where the wind velocity is equal to the sound speed ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 adopting typical parameters for o supergiants , from equation ( [ sonicpoint ] ) we obtain that the clumping phenomenon starts close to the photosphere ( @xmath51 ) . assuming spherical geometry for the clumps and that the mass of each clump is conserved , it is possible to obtain the expansion law of the clumps from equation ( [ legge_densita_clump ] ) , with @xmath52 : @xmath53^{1/3}\\ ] ] from equation ( [ legge_rcl_r ] ) we find that the clump size increases with the distance from the supergiant star .",
    "for the initial clump dimensions we tried two different distributions , a power law @xmath54 and a truncated gaussian function : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a free parameter .    for any given mass clump we derived the minimum and maximum values for the initial radii as follows .",
    "the minimum radius is that below which the clump is optically thick for the uv resonance lines . in this case gravity",
    "dominates over the radiative force causing the clump to fall back onto the supergiant .",
    "the momentum equation of a radiatively driven clump is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass of the supergiant , @xmath60 is the radiative acceleration due to the continuum opacity by electron scattering , @xmath61 is the radiative acceleration due to line scattering . while equation ( [ cak_equation ] )",
    "is an approximation that ignores the pressure gradient , the solution of the momentum equation differs only slightly from the accurate solution derived by @xcite ; another assumption is that the photosphere has been treated as a point source @xcite .",
    "the radiative acceleration due to electron scattering is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the opacity for electron scattering , and is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the thomson cross section , @xmath66 is the number density of electrons , @xmath67 is the density of the clump and @xmath68 is the luminosity of the ob supergiant .",
    "@xcite found @xmath69 . assuming a constant degree of ionization in the wind both @xmath63 and @xmath60 are constant .",
    "the radiative acceleration due to the line scattering is : @xmath70 where @xmath71  @xmath72  g@xmath2 , @xmath30 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are the force multiplier parameters , which are obtained with the calculation of the line radiative force @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 is the dimensionless optical depth parameter @xcite .",
    "according to the model of @xcite , we assume no velocity gradient inside the clump ( of size @xmath76 ) , then we utilize the dimensionless optical depth parameter for a static atmosphere @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is the geometrical dilution factor @xcite , given by : @xmath79\\ ] ] according to the equation ( [ legge_densita_clump ] ) , we find that the number density of electrons in each clump is given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 such that : @xmath82 from equation ( [ cak_equation ] ) we obtain that the minimum radius of the clump is given by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "approximating @xmath75 as @xmath85 and assuming the force multiplier parameters calculated by @xcite , with @xmath86  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath87 , we finally obtain the lower - limit for the clump radius : @xmath88 where : @xmath89 we found that for the interesting range of the clump masses , the drag force @xcite values are less than 3% of the forces resulting from equations ( [ radiative acceleration due to electron scattering ] ) and ( [ g_l ] ) .",
    "thus , in the determination of the minimum clump radius , we can neglect this contribution .",
    "the upper - limit to the clump radius is obtained from the definition of a clump as an over - density with respect to the inter - clump smooth wind :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the mass loss rate of the homogeneous wind component ( inter - clump ) . from equation ( [ rho_cl_max ] ) we obtain the upper - limit for the clump radius @xmath92 the lower and the upper limits for the clump radius ( equations [ r_cl_min ] and [ rho_cl_max ] ) depend on the supergiant parameter @xmath93 , @xmath68 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath20 , @xmath91 .",
    "thus supergiants of different spectral type have , for any given mass of the clump , different minimum and maximum values for the initial radii distribution . however ,",
    "these differences are smaller than a factor 10 for ob supergiants , and the intersection of the upper - limit and lower - limit functions ranges from @xmath94  g to @xmath95  g.",
    "the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion theory [ @xcite ; @xcite ] is usually applied to the hmxbs where a ob supergiant loses mass in the form of a fast stellar wind , ( terminal velocity , @xmath96  km  s@xmath2 ) , that is assumed to be homogeneous and spherically symmetric . only matter within a distance smaller than the _ accretion radius _ ( @xmath97 ) is accreted : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the neutron star mass and @xmath100 is the relative velocity between the neutron star and the wind .",
    "the fraction of stellar wind gravitationally captured by the neutron star is given by : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the density of the wind @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ summary hmxbs ] we have summarized the wind parameters obtained for the 3 sources .",
    "this table shows the typical differences in the mass - loss rate and terminal velocity expected from the cak theory , similar values for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and different values for @xmath105 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which seem to be proportional to the inverse of the effective temperature of the supergiant .",
    "moreover , we found that the values of @xmath11 that best reproduce the observed light curves of the 3 hmxbs studied , are in agreement with the hypothesis that the mass - loss rate derived by the h@xmath73 emission is overestimated by a factor 210 , in agreement with recent studies ( see section [ the effect of the mass - loss rate ] ) .",
    "we can exclude that the observed light curves of the three hmxbs studied can be reproduced with the same set of wind parameters .    in conclusion ,",
    "the different values of @xmath105 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 obtained for the 3 hmxbs studied in this paper reveal that , in the framework of our clumpy wind model , the properties of the clumps of these 3 x  ray binary systems are slightly different , independently of the orbital period .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the different spectral type of the 3 supergiants , which could eject structurally inhomogeneus winds with slightly different properties .",
    "we suggest as a possible cause of this behaviour that the values of @xmath105 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 could be related to the sonic radius where the clumps start @xcite , which depends on the supergiant properties ( equation [ sonicpoint ] ) .",
