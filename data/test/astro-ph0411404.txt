    "unlike the optical spectra of hot cspn , which are characterized by lines of hydrogen , helium and some light metals , the ultraviolet spectra are dominated by fe and ni lines ( schnberner & drilling 1985 ) .",
    "their observed strengths show large variations between different objects suggesting a possible spread in abundances .",
    "iron group lines are ideal temperature indicators ( fig.1 ) , which is important to set up a reliable temperature scale for the hottest cspn .",
    "effective temperatures of the hottest central stars are known with low accuracy only . as a temperature indicater one usually takes the relative strength of neutral and ionized helium lines in optical spectra , however , at very high temperatures",
    "neutral helium lines disappear .",
    "the sample of stars in our study includes seven very hot hydrogen - rich cspn .",
    "these are the same objects that are investigated by traulsen et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) to derive temperature and gravity by utilizing uv lines from light metals , namely c , n , and o. this sample covers the hottest phase of post - agb evolution ( @xmath0@xmath170000k ) and includes four objects , which have been observed with fuse _ and _ hst / stis .    the fuse spectra cover the range 9101180  with a resolution of about 0.1 .",
    "fig.2 displays a section of the available spectra .",
    "they are ordered by increasing effective temperature ( starting from ngc1360 with 97000k , up to ngc6853 with 126000k ) which becomes obvious in the shift of the iron ionisation balance .",
    "only lines of fevi and fevii are labeled in this figure , and the numbers next to the identification bars are the respective log__gf _ _ values .",
    "we also detect lines of c , n , o and of other elements of the iron group . as yet unidentified spectral lines are possibly absorptions of covi ( 1139.4 ) , nivi ( 1096.6 , 1121.9 , 1125.4 , 1141.9 , 1145.0 , 1148.9 ) and mnvi ( 1088.7 , 1128.5 ) .",
    "in addition to the fuse observations , fig.2 displays a model spectrum which is plotted over the spectrum of ngc1360 .",
    "the model has solar abundances , and includes , besides h and he , lines from fevi and fevii .",
    "temperature and gravity of the model ( @xmath0 @xmath2 95000 k and log__g _ _ @xmath2 5.50 ) are close to those derived from the cno analysis mentioned above .",
    "note the h@xmath3 contamination of the fuse spectra other than ngc1360 .",
    "the very broad troughs in lss1362 are h@xmath3 lines , and one can see the matching ( relatively weak ) absorption in ngc7293 .",
    "a large fraction of the absorption features in ngc6853 are from warm h@xmath3 , which will have to be deblended to obtain the photospheric spectrum .",
    "the spectra are analyzed using nlte metal line blanketed model atmospheres in order to determine @xmath0 , surface gravity , and chemical composition . for model calculations we use the tbingen nlte model atmosphere package tmap (",
    "werner & dreizler 1999 ) and the atomic data files of the iron group ions were prepared with the iron opacity interface `` ironic '' ( rauch & deetjen 2003 ) .",
    "the large number of iron lines calls for a statistical treatment of opacities .",
    "we include data from kurucz s ( 1991 ) line list .",
    "the final synthetic spectra contain only lines whose wavelength position is accurately known from laboratory measurements ( so - called pos tables of kurucz ) .",
    "so far , all models have solar abundances and include h and he , plus lines from fevi , and fevii .",
    "the possibility of using the fevi / fevii ionisation equilibrium as a temperature indicator can be seen by the disappearance of fevi lines and the increasing strength of fevii lines in the spectra of models with increasing effective temperature ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the decrease of the fevii line strengths in the hottest model is explained by a shift of the ionization balance from fevii to feviii .",
    "( all models have log__g _ _ = 7 . )",
    "our first calculations seem to confirm that the temperature of ngc1360 is indeed lower than previously thought .",
    "the study of cno lines arrived at a similar result .",
    "the iron abundance in ngc1360 is apparently close to solar .",
