    "as a conventional wisdom , one often employs the kondo mechanism to understand the hf behavior , in which the conduction electrons make bound states with the local f - orbital moments in a coherent fashion to result in fermionic quasiparticles integrating the local f - orbital moments with it . while it is still unclear how the single site kondo mechanism can be generalized to the periodic lattice system , at least the above line of thinking seems to provide the correct energy scale , i.e. the coherent energy scale of forming heavy renormalized fermionic quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "however , this phenomenological picture does nt explain many experimental observations of hf systems , such as , strong temperature dependence of specific heat @xmath0 and bulk susceptibility @xmath1 below the coherent temperature @xmath2 , the coexistence of the magnetism ( often antiferromagnetism ( afm ) ) and the heavy quasiparticle in some compounds , and superconductivity in some other compounds .",
    "those compounds which displays both hf properties as well as the magnetism ( either magnetic fluctuations or the magnetic long range order(lro ) ) are conveniently called `` magnetic hf '' by experimentalists .",
    "then again the common wisdom for this class of hf systems is the competition between the kondo coupling between the local f - orbitals and the conduction electrons and the rkky interaction among the local f - orbitals themselves @xcite .",
    "and at qualitative level the result of this competition is that the ground state should be either pure hf state ( all local moment is completely compensated by conduction electrons ) or pure magnetic state ( no compensation of the local moment ) depending on which energy scale is larger .",
    "however the experimental situation is that these magnetic hf compounds not only show the coexistence of the local moment and the heavy quasiparticle but also almost always the size of the local moment is much smaller than its ionic limit value .",
    "therefore , it is clear that a minimum requirement to understand experimental observations is that the true ground state wave function for the magnetic hf compounds should simultaneously possess both the heavy quasiparticle and local moment characters .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a variational wave function for the ground state of the magnetic hf systems , in which the local f - orbital wave function exists in the mixed states ( a linear combination of the full local moment state and the fully compensated state ) , and we call it `` mixed moment state '' after the `` mixed valence state''@xcite . in the following sections ,",
    "we show how this mixed moment state can be realized in the kondo lattice model using the large - n scheme .",
    "this part is rather qualitative based on account of the energetics of the competition between different couplings .",
    "once this mixed moment state is phenomenologically accepted , then this ground state properties can immediately provide explanations for the most puzzling questions of magnetic hf compounds : small uncompensated local moment , the coexistence of the afm and pm domains ( the pm domain can be even a superconducting phase ) , and as the most interesting possibility , the local quantum criticality coinciding with the magnetic criticality and its relation with the fermi surface ( fs ) fluctuations , etc .",
    "we start with the kondo lattice hamiltonian ( klh ) .    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the conduction electron creation and annihilation operators and @xmath5 are the local f - orbital operators , and the spin operators are the large n generalization of su(2 ) spin @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the f - orbital and conduction electron spins , respectively .",
    "the above hamiltonian is the usual kondo lattice hamiltonian extended with the large n spin degeneracy ( @xmath8 ) and the f - orbital occupancy is constrained with @xmath9 @xcite representing the large on - site coulomb interaction between the localized f - orbitals at the same site .",
    "finally the rkky interaction term between the f - orbitals is added @xcite .",
    "the above hamiltonian has been studied by numerous authors using various techniques@xcite . without the rkky term ,",
    "the various approximation ( mainly the approximation treating the constraint @xmath10 ) provides a solution of heavy renormalized coherent band(s ) to explain the hf phenomena . when the rkky term is added as in eq.(1 )",
    "not only any approximate solution becomes more complicated but more importantly the question of the correctness of treating the constraint becomes crucial because the fate of the competition / interplay between the kondo and the rkky interactions is largely unknown to determine the true ground state .",
    "there are a few studies of the two impurity version of this model @xcite .",
    "all these studies indicate that there is a critical ratio of interactions ( @xmath11 ) from which the ground state flows away toward either a magnetically correlated state or the kondo singlet state . while we learn from these studies that there is an interesting competition between the kondo and rkky interactions , a naive extension of this picture to the lattice system is not warranted .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , motivated by experimental observations , we construct a new variational wave function for the ground state of the above hamiltonian .",
    "we start with the f - orbital wave function as follows .",
    "@xmath12    the above expression is designed to indicate that the f - orbital state in the ground state can be a superposition of two qualitatively different states ; one is the itinerant state ( @xmath13 ) which makes a coherent singlet state with the conduction electrons via renormalized hybridization through kondo coupling @xcite and the other is the full local moment state ( @xmath14 ) which remains intact from forming kondo singlet or heavy quasiparticle but couples only as a local magnetic moment with other electrons . with the above ansatz for the f - orbital state , we diagonalize the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) in large n approximation .",
    "the ground state should determine the value of @xmath15 to minimized the total energy of the hamiltonian .",
    "this wave function , if it is realized as a true ground state , displays the mixed moment state in a basically same manner as the mixed valence state @xcite , and the origin of these mixed states is the local coulomb interaction .",
    "assuming the variational ansatz of eq.(2 ) , the kondo coupling term in eq.(1 ) is decomposed into two parts depending on which component of f - orbital states is involved .",
    "@xmath16    in the above equation , we rewrite the kondo term coupled with the itinerant component of the f - orbital by the four fermionic expression often employed in the large - n treatment of kondo coupling @xcite . the second term represents the local moment part of the f - orbital state , which remains as a local moment and does not participate in forming the heavy quasiparticles .",
    "now the hamiltonian can be written as ,    @xmath17    @xmath18 part is well studied by many authors and in particular the large n technique is convenient to produce the heavy renormalized quasiparticle band(s ) .",
    "switching on the kondo coupling ( @xmath19 ) , the ground state of @xmath18 lowers its energy compared to @xmath20 state ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath22 part also should gain energy by developing a magnetic correlation , but the first term of @xmath22 , by coupling with the conduction electrons ( @xmath23 electrons ) , also increases the kinetic energy of the @xmath18 .",
    "first , we consider @xmath18 .",
    "the only difference from the previous studies is that the kondo coupling @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath24 and also the f - orbital occupancy constraint is modified as @xmath25 ( accordingly the fermi surface volume changes with @xmath15 ) . introducing the stratonovich - hubbard decoupling field @xmath26 , @xmath18 is diagonalized and the renormalized @xmath27 is fixed to satisfy the constraint @xmath25 .",
    "following read et al .",
    "( ref.[2 ] ) , the kondo energy gain @xmath28 is written as ,    @xmath29 -\\epsilon_f ( 1-\\alpha ) + \\frac{n } { j_{k } ( 1-\\alpha ) } \\phi_0 ^2\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the typical conduction band width and @xmath31 is the density of states ( dos ) of it .",
    "the self - consistent equations are as follows .",
    "@xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the above equations , we find the kondo energy gain per site is the following .",
    "@xmath33.\\ ] ]    the system gains the above energy by compensating a fraction @xmath34 of the local moments via kondo screening and the conduction band becomes a renormalized heavy band(s ) .",
    "now let us consider @xmath22 .",
    "the rkky term would gain the following energy per site with the maximum polarization @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36    the first term of @xmath22 ( eq.(6 ) ) now forces the afm coupling of the conduction electrons ( @xmath23 electrons ) with a staggered field @xmath37 or a staggered energy level @xmath38 . with this staggered energy level for @xmath23-electrons , the renormalized heavy band(s ) should further develop spin density wave ( sdw ) ordering and it will cost the kinetic energy increase as follows .    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the dos of the renormalized band at chemical potential and @xmath41 is the bogoliubov coefficient of @xmath42 component of the renormalized band operators which diagonalize eq.(5 ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the fermi velocity and @xmath44 is the sdw ordering vector @xcite . finally , the total energy gain of @xmath22 with both the local magnetic and sdw orderings is as follows .",
    "@xmath45    now collecting all the energy gain and loss , the total energy difference by the kondo and rkky couplings is written as    @xmath46 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + a^{(2 ) } \\alpha^2 + a^{(4 ) }   \\alpha^4 + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 , @xmath50 and since @xmath51 o(n ) they are all o(n@xmath52 ) .",
    "ellipsis indicates the higher order terms ( o(@xmath53 ) etc . )",
    "treating @xmath54 and @xmath55 as phenomenological parameters , in fig.(1 ) we show the schematic total energy gain @xmath56 of eq.(15 ) for the three representative cases .",
    "there is always a local minimum with a finite value of @xmath15 ( due to @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , when this local minimum is not a global minimum as in fig.1.a , the ground state is a pure hf state ( @xmath57 , no magnetic hf ) with fully screened local f - moments .",
    "in contrast , when this local minimum with a finite @xmath15 becomes a global minimum as depicted in fig.1.b . , then the ground state is a `` mixed moment '' state .",
    "if a fine tuning occurs such as using pressure , magnetic fields , chemical substitution , etc .",
    ", then two minima can be degenerate with @xmath58 and @xmath57 as in fig.1.c . in this case , as the tuning parameter changes , the ground state goes through a first order transition accompanying with a jump of magnetization and fs volume .",
    "finally , the above discussions are mean field level and therefore a @xmath15 smaller than a critical value would not develop a true long range order ( lro ) of local moments due to fluctuations ; it means that the nonmagnetic phase near the magnetic phase boundary should have a small but finite @xmath15 value .",
    "in our mixed moment state , the ground state is a superposition of the unscreened full local moments and the kondo renormalized itinerant band(s ) .",
    "we first consider the consequence of this ground state for the measurement of the local moment by neutron diffraction ( nd ) experiment . at",
    "any given time , a fraction ( @xmath15 ) of u sites have a full local moment and a fraction ( @xmath60 ) of u sites are completely quenched by the conduction electrons .",
    "now the unquenched local moment is magnetically screened by the opposite sdw moment developed by the renormalized itinerant band .",
    "this incompletely screened magnetic moment is the effective local moment ( @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ) .",
    "now the nd should see the ensemble averaged size of the local moment , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "this value can be tiny ( @xmath64 for uru@xmath59si@xmath59 ) while @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not necessarily tiny .    a recent nmr experiment by k. matsuda et al .",
    "@xcite reports another puzzling data on magnetic moment . in this experiment",
    ", @xmath67si nmr spectra clearly shows that @xmath67si sites see both the afm ordered phase and the pm phase below the magnetic transition temperature @xmath68 and these authors interpret the data with a spatial inhomogeneous mixture of afm and pm domains . from the estimated volume fraction of afm domain , it is concluded that the actual size of local moment is at least @xmath69/u , an order of magnitude larger than the estimation from the neutron bragg peak intensity@xcite . in our picture , the coexistence of afm and pm is not of a static inhomogeneous domain structure , but at any given time the @xmath67si nuclei should see a fraction ( @xmath15 ) of @xmath65 and a fraction ( @xmath60 ) of zero moment from u sites . from this experiment",
    "we can read the size of sdw moment by @xmath70 and @xmath71 . combining nd and nmr data , @xmath64 = ( @xmath72 )",
    ", @xmath73 is estimated for uru@xmath59si@xmath59 for ambient pressure .",
    "also the observation of a distribution of local effective fields at @xmath67si sites from @xmath67si nmr by o.o .",
    "bernal et al .",
    "@xcite is a natural consequence of the local moment fluctuations of nearby u sites between zero and a finite value .    a strong pressure dependence of the local moment size from nd by h. amitsuka et al .",
    "@xcite ( from @xmath74 to @xmath75 ) and much slower increase of the magnetic ordering temperature ( @xmath76 ) is not inconsistent with our model : the measured local moment size is ( u full local moment @xmath77 sdw moment ) @xmath78 and in zeroth approximation @xmath76 is @xmath79 ( eq.(6 ) ) assuming the rkky coupling @xmath80 constant @xcite .",
    "applying pressure should change @xmath15 ( increasing in uru@xmath59si@xmath59 ) and @xmath81 increases , but the increase of the effective local moment size should be a more complicate function of @xmath15 .",
    "in the mixed moment state , the total carrier density in the renormalized itinerant band is given as @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the original conduction electron density ) .",
    "therefore , the fs volume changes by how much of the f - electrons participates to form the coherent heavy quasiparticle band(s ) through the kondo coupling . as a result",
    "the fluctuations of the local moment weight @xmath15 is intimately coupled to the fluctuations of fs and any phase transition of one part should trigger a transition of the other part .",
    "one consequence is an enhanced specific heat jump @xmath84 at the second order transition as commonly observed in many magnetic hf compounds . in general , the specific heat jump at the second order transition temperature can be expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath85    the first case ( @xmath86 ) can be applied to uru@xmath59si@xmath59 , which is well known for its extremely tiny local moment ( @xmath64 ) from nd but displaying a huge jump ( @xmath87 mol ) at the magnetic transition @xmath88 to obtain some quantitative scales , first note that @xmath89 indicates the rkky coupling should be large enough to justify the relatively high transition temperature with a small averaged local moment value ( @xmath90 ) , and it also means that @xmath19 is not a small value @xcite and indeed the experimental @xmath91 . thus the average internal fields induced by the local moment ordering is given by @xmath92 ( the first term in eq.(6 ) ) , which is not so tiny value despite the acclaimed small effective local moment .",
    "then the itinerant renormalized band develops a sdw ordering over a part of fs simultaneously at @xmath93 and it can provide the major contribution to the specific heat jump ( in the mean field theory @xmath94 ) . the second case ( eq.(17 ) )",
    "is for the sc transition ( for example , cecoin@xmath95@xcite ) .",
    "the deformation of fs due to the sc should trigger a concomitant change in @xmath15 .",
    "many magnetic hf compounds exhibit non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behaviors in resistivity , specific heat , neutron scattering , susceptibility etc @xcite . often these behaviors coincide with the magnetic quantum transition ( mostly afm transition ) . however , theoretically any quantum critical fluctuations , which is spatially correlated , is not sufficient to explain the nfl behaviors .",
    "therefore , what is naturally required is a `` local quantum criticality '' not only for nfl hf compounds but perhaps also for the high temperature superconducting materials .",
    "there are a few theoretical proposals@xcite of local quantum criticality in the strongly correlated electron system with different ideas .",
    "our `` mixed moment '' ground state can provide a natural mechanism for the local quantum criticality , in particular , for nfl hf compounds .",
    "the first term of eq.(6 ) provides a coupling between the conduction electrons ( @xmath96 ) and local spins ( @xmath97 ) , and the local spins develop its own dynamics through the rkky interaction , which can go through the magnetic quantum criticality by tuning external parameters .",
    "this is a two component spin - fermion model recently proposed to study the superconductivity of cemin@xmath95@xcite . now in addition to the spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations , if the moment weight fluctuations @xmath98 is allowed in higher order corrections , this fluctuations absorbs any value of momentum exchange just like impurities as far as the typical energy of this fluctuations is much higher than the typical low energy scale of the spin fluctuations @xmath99 .",
    "then all conduction electrons around fs can be scattered off each other by a critical magnetic fluctuations with a help of the local moment weight fluctuations .",
    "this process is depicted diagramatically in fig.2 .",
    "therefore , in this picture _ the spatially correlated magnetic quantum criticality becomes a local quantum criticality with a help of the local moment weight fluctuations . _",
    "to summarize , we propose a new variational wave function for the magnetic hf which represents a mixed moment ground state .",
    "we use a mean field analysis in large n limit of the klh added with rkky interaction and show that this is indeed a generic ground state for a certain ratio of the couplings of kondo and rkky .",
    "then we show that this mixed moment ground state can immediately provide natural explanations for the most puzzling observations in magnetic hf compounds ( uru@xmath59si@xmath59 , upt@xmath100 , cemin@xmath95 , cecu@xmath101au@xmath102 , etc . ) such as a tiny ordered magnetic moment , large specific heat jump , a coexistence of afm and pm phases , a distribution of internal fields , and most interestingly the local quantum criticality coinciding with the spatial magnetic criticality .",
