    "there are many astrophysical systems on which the physics of neutrinos in a magnetic field plays an important role .",
    "let us recall that proto - neutron stars typically possess very strong magnetic fields .",
    "large magnetic fields @xmath3 g have been associated with the surface of supernovas @xcite and neutron stars @xcite , and fields perhaps as large as @xmath4 g with magnetars @xcite .",
    "even larger fields could exist in the star s interior .",
    "it is presumed from the scalar virial theorem @xcite that the interior field in neutron stars could be as high as @xmath5 g. a magnetic field as this ( @xmath6 g ) in the interior of a compact star will be larger in two orders than the chemical potential characterizing its quark matter density .    unveiling",
    "the interconnection between the star magnetic field and its particle current flows could shed new light to the question of the star evolution .",
    "for example , it is well known that neutrinos drive supernova dynamics from beginning to end .",
    "neutrino emission and interactions play a crucial role in core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "their eventual emission from the proto - neutron star contains nearly all the energy released in the star explosion .",
    "neutrino luminosity , emissivity and the specific heat of the densest parts of the star are governed by charged and neutral current interactions involving matter at high densities and in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "thus , a total understanding of the star cooling mechanism in a strongly magnetized medium is crucial for astrophysics .    on the other hand , the explanation of large - scale magnetic fields observed in a number of galaxies , and in clusters of galaxies @xcite seems to require the existence of seed fields of primordial origin @xcite . according to several mechanisms @xcite ,",
    "strong primordial fields @xmath7 g could be generated at the electroweak transition .",
    "even larger fields have been associated with superconducting magnetic strings , which would generate fields @xmath8 g in their vicinity if created after inflation @xcite .    were primordial magnetic fields present in the early universe , they would have had non - trivial consequences for particle - physics cosmology .",
    "for instance , as it is well known , oscillations between neutrino flavors may change the relative abundance of neutrino species and may thereby affect primordial nucleosynthesis ( for a recent review on neutrinos in cosmology see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if a strong magnetic field ( @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the w - boson and electron masses respectively ) modifies the neutrino energy spectrum of different flavors in different ways , a primordial magnetic field can consequently influence the oscillation process in the primeval plasma @xcite .",
    "the propagation of neutrinos in magnetized media has been previously investigated by several authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "weak - field calculations were done for magnetized vacuum in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and at @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the electric chemical potential ) in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the @xmath13 case , as long as @xmath15 , both the field- and temperature - dependent leading contributions to the neutrino energy resulted of @xmath16-order @xcite-@xcite . in the charged plasma @xcite , the field - dependent terms were much larger , @xmath17 , but they vanished in the ( @xmath18)-limit .",
    "the weak - field results of papers @xcite-@xcite led to think that the magnetic - field effects could be significant in astrophysics , because of the field- and @xmath19-dependent terms of order @xmath20 , but were irrelevant ( @xmath21-order ) in the early universe due to its charge - symmetric character ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence , it has been assumed that in cosmology the main contribution to neutrino energy was the purely thermal term of order @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , as we will show below , a strong magnetic field ( @xmath24 ) gives rise to a new contribution to the neutrino energy that is linear in the field , independent of the chemical potential , and that is of the same order ( @xmath20 ) as the largest terms found in the weak - field charged - medium case .",
    "this new result can turn magnetic - field effects relevant for cosmology .    in recent papers @xcite , @xcite",
    ", we investigated the effects of a strong magnetic field on neutrinos in magnetized vacuum ( i.e. with @xmath25 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "there , to facilitate the calculations in the strong - field limit , we extended the ritus ep - eigenfunction method of diagonalization of the green functions of spin-1/2 charged particle in electromagnetic field @xcite-@xcite , to the case of spin-1 charged particles @xcite .",
    "this formulation , which is particularly advantageous for strong - field calculations , provides an alternative method to the schwinger approach to address qft problems in electromagnetic backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the use of the ritus method resulted very convenient to study the neutrino - self - energy in magnetized media , since it allowed to diagonalize in momentum space both the electron and the w - boson green s functions in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "ritus formalism has also been recently applied to investigate non - perturbative qft in electromagnetic backgrounds @xcite .    from the above considerations it is clear that strong magnetic fields can play a significant role in a variety of astrophysical systems , and possibly also in the early universe . for these applications ,",
    "the analysis has to be carried out in the presence of a medium .",
    "thus , in the present paper we extend the results obtained in papers @xcite and @xcite to include finite temperature and density , performing a detailed study of the effects of a strong magnetic field on neutrino propagation in neutral and charged media , and discussing possible applications to astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "we stress that in calculating the neutrino self - energy in a magnetized medium , we should consider , as usual , its vacuum and statistical parts . in this case",
    "the vacuum part depends on the magnetic field , and for strong fields it can make important contributions even at high temperatures @xmath26 .",
    "the reason is that the vacuum and statistical terms have different analytical behaviors , due to the lack of the statistic ultraviolet cutoff in the vacuum part .",
    "this fact gives rise to a field - dependent vacuum contribution ( @xmath20-order ) which is larger than the thermal one ( @xmath16-order ) , into the self - energy .",
    "therefore , as shown in this paper , a strong magnetic field can become more relevant than temperature for neutrino propagation in neutral media .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ selfen - gen - struc ] we consider the radiative correction to the neutrino dispersion relation in the presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "we introduce the general covariant structure of the neutrino self - energy in the presence of an external field , and find the dispersion relation as a function of the coefficients of each independent term in the covariant structure .",
    "the general form of the found dispersion relation goes beyond any given approximation and medium characteristic and serves as a guidance for particular applications .",

    "the operator @xmath29 is a lorentz scalar that can be formed in the spinorial space taking the contractions between the characteristic vectors and tensors of the system with all the independent elements of the dirac ring .",
    "explicit chirality reduces it to @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the chiral projector operators , and @xmath32 is a lorentz vector that can be spanned as a superposition of four basic vectors that can be formed from the characteristic tensors of the problem . in a magnetized medium , besides the neutrino four - momentum @xmath33 , we have to consider the magnetic - field strength tensor @xmath34 , to form the covariant structures @xmath35 in ( [ 3 ] ) we introduced the notations @xmath36 , and @xmath37 @xmath38 . in the covariant representation the magnetic field can be expressed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the vector four - velocity of the center of mass of the magnetized medium .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field , and hence of the dimensionless magnetic field tensor @xmath41 and its dual @xmath42 , allows the covariant separation in ( [ 3 ] ) between longitudinal and transverse momentum terms that appears naturally in magnetic backgrounds @xmath43 coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are lorentz scalars that depend on the parameters of the theory and the approximation used . notice that finite temperature and/or density would not introduce any new term into eq .",

    "let us consider the one - loop corrections to the neutrino self - energy in the presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "to leading order in the fermi coupling constant the main field - dependent contribution to the self - energy comes from the bubble diagram ( fig.i - a ) with internal lines of virtual charged leptons and w - bosons , and from the tadpole diagram ( fig.i - b ) with virtual loop of charged leptons .    in a neutral medium",
    "only the bubble diagram contributes , while in a charged medium both diagrams should be considered .",
    "however , only the bubble distinguishes between neutrino flavors , since the flavor of the internal charged lepton is directly associated to the flavor of the propagating neutrino ( i.e. the one appearing in the external legs ) . for the tadpole , because the internal boson is the neutral z - boson , the charged leptons corresponding to different families are linked to the same neutrino flavor .",
    "therefore , in regards to magnetic field effects on neutrino oscillations , the bubble contribution is the essential one .",

    "another difference between ( [ 68 ] ) and ( [ 71 ] ) , is that in the last dispersion relation the rest energy @xmath243 does not depend on the magnetic field .",

    "this property is crucial for a possible explanation of the peculiar high pulsar velocities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the anisotropic term that modifies the kinetic energy in the strong - field approximation , the neutrino energy - momentum relation is invariant under the change of @xmath246 by @xmath247 .    substituting ( [ 68 ] ) into ( [ 61 ] ) we obtain that the neutrino / anti - neutrino index of refraction in the charged medium is given by @xmath248 the result ( [ 73 ] ) implies that the index of refraction depends on the neutrino direction of motion relative to the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , neutrinos and antineutrinos have different index of refractions and therefore different phase velocities even if they move in the same direction . for neutrinos , if @xmath249 ( i.e. if there is a larger number of electrons than positrons ) the index of refraction for @xmath250 is smaller than one , so their phase velocities will be smaller than light velocity .",
    "thus , in the charged medium with strong magnetic field , neutrinos behave as massive particles .",
    "this is in agreement with the behavior they have in a dense medium , even in the absence of magnetic field @xcite . on the other hand , for anti - neutrinos the index of refraction ( the one with the positive sign in front of @xmath237 in ( [ 73 ] ) ) can be larger than one .",
    "for instance , for anti - neutrinos moving opposite to the field - line directions the index of refraction is @xmath251    thus , antineutrinos will have phase velocities larger than @xmath46 and depending on the magnetic field strength and electron density . in this regard",
    "we should mention that particles with zero rest mass can even have group velocities that exceed @xmath46 in anomalously dispersive media @xcite .",

    "the strength of the primordial magnetic field in the neutrino decoupling era can be estimated from the constraints derived from the successful nucleosynthesis prediction of primordial @xmath384 abundance @xcite@xmath385 as well as on the neutrino mass and oscillation limits @xcite .",
    "these constraints , together with the energy equipartition principle , lead to the relations @xmath386 with @xmath387 being the muon mass .",
    "then , it is reasonable to assume that between the qcd phase transition epoch and the end of nucleosynthesis a primordial magnetic field in the above range could have been present @xcite .    unlike the stellar material ,",
    "whose density can be of order one , we know that the early universe was almost charge symmetric , with a particle - antiparticle asymmetry of only @xmath388 . therefore , when considering possible consequences of our results for the early universe , we should restrict the discussion to the neutral case ( @xmath13 ) .    for the neutral case",
    ", it is known that at weak field all the corrections in the neutrino energy density , whether they depend on the field and/or temperature , are second order in the fermi coupling constant @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , therefore negligible small .",
    "nevertheless , it can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ 63])-([64 ] ) that if sufficiently strong magnetic fields were present in the primeval plasma , they would yield corrections to the energy density that are linear in the fermi coupling constant .",
    "moreover , as shown in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] , the strong - field approximation that led to these corrections is reliable even for magnetic fields in a more realistic range ( i.e. as those satisfying condition ( [ 105 ] ) ) .",
    "notice that a field satisfying ( [ 105 ] ) would be effectively strong with respect to the electron - neutrino , but weak for the remaining neutrino flavors .",
    "if such a field existed during the decoupling era , it could significantly affect the @xmath389 and @xmath390 resonant oscillations @xcite , as the field would differently modify the energy of @xmath391 compared to those of @xmath392 , @xmath393 and @xmath394 the interesting new thing here is that despite these oscillations would take place in an essentially neutral medium , because of the strong field they will be as significant as those produced by the msw mechanism @xcite in a dense medium .",
    "a peculiarity of the strong - field effects on the neutrino energy density is to give rise to anisotropic resonant oscillations .",
    "that is , the oscillation probability depends on the direction of the neutrino propagation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "another interesting question related to primordial magnetic fields is whether they influenced neutrino propagation prior to the electroweak phase transition , since some of the mechanisms of primordial magnetic field generation allow their existence at very early epochs @xcite , @xcite . before the electroweak transition",
    "a primordial magnetic field could only exist in the form of a u(1 ) hypermagnetic field @xcite .",
    "any non - abelian `` magnetic '' field would decay at high temperatures because it would acquire a non - perturbative infrared magnetic mass  @xmath395 .",
    "the implications of primordial hypermagnetic fields in neutrino propagation before the electroweak phase transition have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the strong - field effects led to a large anisotropy in the leptons energies .",
    "the anisotropy was due to the degeneracy in the energy , which in the leading order does not depend on the transverse momentum component .",
    "it is in contrast with the magnetic field case , which takes place after the electroweak phase transition , where , although an anisotropy in the neutrino energy is also present , no degeneracy occurs ( see eqs .",
    "[ 63])-([64 ] ) ) .",
    "this different behavior is a direct consequence , on one hand , of the nonzero neutrino hypercharge and hence of the minimally coupling of these particles to the hypermagnetic field ; and on the other , of their electrical neutrality , which implies that they can interact with a magnetic field through radiative corrections only .",
    "we underline that the anisotropy in the energy spectrum of neutrinos in background fields could provide an independent way to verify the existence of primordial magnetic fields , since a field - induced anisotropy would be reflected as an imprint in a yet undetected and elusive cosmic background of neutrinos produced during the decoupling era .    for astrophysical applications we should turn our attention to the star interiors characterized by high densities of charged particles under strong magnetic fields . as shown in sec",
    ".  [ index - ref ] , in the charged medium case the strong - field approximation gives rise to a modification of the kinetic part of the neutrino energy ( first term in eq.([68 ] ) ) , that is not present in leading order at weak field ( eq .  ( [ 71 ] ) ) @xcite . due to this new term",
    "the largest field - dependent contribution to the neutrino kinetic energy comes from neutrinos propagating perpendicularly to the field .",
    "it is worth noticing that the anisotropic term associated with the effective magnetic moment in the dispersion relations ( [ 68 ] ) and ( [ 71 ] ) changes sign when neutrinos reverse their direction of motion . on the other hand , the kinetic energy term in ( [ 68 ] ) remains unchanged when the neutrinos moves in opposite direction , even though it depends on the direction of propagation of the neutrinos with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "as known @xcite , the anisotropy associated to the magnetic - moment contribution to the neutrino energy can be relevant for a possible explanation of the peculiar high pulsar velocities .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the combined effects of the two different anisotropies to understand whether they could affect the dynamics of proto - neutron stars .",
    "another possible ground of applications of our results is supernova neutrinos .",
    "core collapse supernovae are dominated by neutrinos and their transport properties .",
    "in addition , the observation of neutrinos from supernova , which is essential to confirm the basic picture of supernova explosion , can be affected by neutrino oscillations . as we have pointed out in this paper , neutrino transport and oscillations can be both modified by the presence of a strong magnetic field",
    ". magnetic fields as strong as @xmath396 to @xmath397 g could exist in the first seconds of neutrino emission inside the supernova core @xcite .",
    "thus , the electron - neutrino energy spectrum found in this paper , within the strong - field limit for the charged medium , should be considered for any study of neutrino oscillations under those conditions .",
    "in this paper we carried out a thorough study of the propagation of neutrinos in strongly magnetized neutral and charged media .",
    "we started from the most general structure of the neutrino self - energy in a magnetic field , expressing it as the sum of four independent covariant terms with coefficients that are functions of the physical variables of the theory and whose values depend on the approximation considered .",
    "general expressions of the four coefficients at one - loop approximation were given in eqs .",
    "( [ 25]-[28 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients were then calculated in the strong - field limit using the lll aproximation for the electrons .",
    "the lll was assumed to be valid in the parameter range @xmath329 , @xmath381 @xmath382 . to justify it",
    "one should keep in mind that under these conditions most electrons would not have enough energy to overcome the gap between the landau levels .",
    "hence , they will be mainly confined to their lower levels and the leading contribution would come from the lll .",
    "this assumption was also corroborated for the above parameters range by numerical calculations summing in all landau levels .",
    "the dispersion relation of the neutrinos was written as a function of the four coefficients of the self - energy structures , allowing in this way to straightforwardly obtain the neutrino s energy in the strong - field limit for each physical case .    in concordance with results previously obtained in charged media at weak fields @xcite,@xcite , in the strong - field case an energy term associated with the interaction between the magnetic field and the effective magnetic moment",
    "was also found at leading order in @xmath398 .",
    "this interaction energy disappears in the neutral medium , since in a charged - symmetric plasma the contribution to the effective magnetic moment coming from electrons and positrons cancels out .",
    "a main outcome of our investigation was to show that in strongly magnetized systems a term of different nature emerges in both charged and neutral media .",
    "the new term , which is linear in the magnetic field and of first order in @xmath398 , enters as a correction to the neutrino kinetic energy in the presence of a strong - magnetic field .",
    "this correction is present even in a strongly magnetized vacuum , since it is related to the vacuum part ( @xmath170 @xmath13 ) of the neutrino self - energy at @xmath399 .",
    "a characteristic of the field - dependent corrections to the neutrino energy is that they produce an anisotropic index of refraction , since neutrinos moving along different directions have different field - dependent dispersion relations .",
    "we should underline that while the magnetic moment interaction term produces a maximum field effect for neutrinos propagating along the field lines , the field correction to the kinetic energy does not contribute to those propagation modes , but on the contrary , the maximum kinetic - energy effect takes place for neutrinos propagating perpendicularly to the field direction .",
    "we stress that the anisotropy does not differentiate between neutrinos and antineutrinos",
    ".    the charged medium results reported in the current work can be of interest for the astrophysics of neutrinos in stars with large magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , our finding for the neutral medium can have applications in cosmology , if the existence of high primordial magnetic fields is finally confirmed .",
    "contrary to some authors belief @xcite,@xcite that , regardless of the field intensity , the neutrino dispersion relation in the early universe is well approximated by the dispersion relation in the zero field medium , our results indicate that strong , and even weakly strong , magnetic fields can give rise to a contribution to the neutrino energy that is several orders larger than the pure thermal contribution .    the field - dependent correction to the neutrino energy in a neutral medium with strong magnetic field can have an impact in neutrino flavor - oscillations in the primeval plasma @xcite and therefore affect primordial nucleosynthesis . hence",
    ", this new effect could be important to establish possible limits to the strength of the primordial magnetic field .",
