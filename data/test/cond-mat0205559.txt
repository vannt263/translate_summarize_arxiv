    "the mechanism by which a large class of proteins folds spontaneously into a unique globular shape @xcite has remained elusive .",
    "significant new insight was gained over the last few years from the studies of minimal protein models .",
    "for instance , energy landscape theory and funnel concept @xcite proved to be powerful tools for description of the general characteristics of folding not only in minimalistic protein models but also for real proteins @xcite .",
    "however , many questions on the details of the folding process remain to be solved .",
    "for instance , folding of proteins involves one or more transitions between different thermodynamic states .",
    "the role of these transitions in the folding process is an active area of research .",
    "an important example for these transitions is the formation of secondary structure elements . for the case of @xmath0-helices",
    "it is long known that there is a sharp transition towards a random coil state when the temperature is increased .",
    "the characteristics of this so - called helix - coil transition have been studied extensively @xcite , most recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , we research the relation between helix - coil transition and folding .    for this purpose , we have studied an artificial peptide , ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 , in a detailed representation where the interactions between all atoms are taken into account .",
    "multicanonical simulations @xcite with large statistics are used to evaluate the free energy landscape of our peptide at different temperatures .",
    "the encountered transitions are further investigated by partition zeros analysis which allows to characterize `` phase transitions '' in small systems @xcite .",
    "quantities such as the energy , specific heat , helicity and susceptibility were calculated as function of temperature .",
    "we have neglected in the simulations the interaction of our artifical peptide with the surrounding solvent .",
    "while this is certainly a crude approximation , it allows us not only to relate our results to our previous studies on helix - coil transition in poly - alanine that also relied on gas - phase simulations @xcite , but also to study the extend to that secondary structure formation and folding are determined by intrinsic properties of the peptide .",
    "our data suggest that the peptide in gas - phase folds in a two - step process : in a first step two @xmath0-helices are formed in what amounts to a first order transition .",
    "afterwards these helices re - arrange themselves into a u - like structure .",
    "the second step has the characteristics of a second order transition .",
    "our investigation of ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 is based on a detailed , all - atom representation of that peptide .",
    "the interaction between the atoms is described by a standard force field , ecepp/2,@xcite ( as implemented in the program package smmp @xcite ) and is given by : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 ( in  ) is the distance between the atoms @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the @xmath8-th torsion angle .",
    "the peptide bond angles were set to their common value @xmath9 .",
    "we do not include explicitly the interaction of the peptide with the solvent into our simulations and set the dielectric constant @xmath10 equal to 2 . since the charges at peptide termini are known to reduce helix content @xcite , we removed them by taking a neutral nh@xmath11 group at the n - terminus and a neutral cooh group at the c - terminus .",
    "simulation of detailed protein models where the interaction between all atoms are taken into account are extremely difficult .",
    "this is because the various competing interactions within the molecule lead to an energy landscape characterized by a multitude of local minima separated by high energy barriers .",
    "hence , in the low - temperature region , canonical monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations will tend to get trapped in one of these minima and the simulation will not thermalize within the available cpu time .",
    "one example of the new and sophisticated algorithms @xcite that allow to overcome this difficulty are _ generalized - ensemble _ techniques @xcite , and it is one of these techniques , multicanonical sampling @xcite , that we used for our investigations .    in the multicanonical algorithm @xcite conformations with energy @xmath12",
    "are assigned a weight @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the density of states .",
    "a simulation with this weight will lead to a uniform distribution of energy : @xmath15 this is because the simulation generates a 1d random walk in the energy space , allowing itself to escape from any local minimum .",
    "since a large range of energies are sampled , one can use the reweighting techniques @xcite to calculate thermodynamic quantities over a wide range of temperatures @xmath16 by @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for configurations .",
    "note that unlike in the case of canonical simulations the weights @xmath19 are not a priori known .",
    "instead estimators for these weights have to be determined by an iterative procedure @xcite .",
    "in our case we needed 500,000 sweeps for the weight factor calculations .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities were then estimated from one production run of @xmath20 monte carlo sweeps which followed 10,000 sweeps for thermalization .",
    "our simulations were started from completely random initial conformations ( hot start ) and one monte carlo sweep updates every torsion angle of the peptide once . at the end of every 10th sweep we stored the ecepp/2 energies",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 of the conformation , the corresponding number @xmath23 of helical residues and end - to - end distance @xmath24 . here , we follow previous work @xcite and consider a residue as helical if its backbone angle @xmath25 are within the range @xmath26 .    using the results of our generalized - ensemble simulation , we explored for various temperatures the free energies @xmath27 here",
    ", @xmath28 is the probability to find a peptide conformation with values @xmath29 , @xmath24 ( at temperature @xmath16 ) .",
    "we chose the normalization so that the lowest value of @xmath30 is set to zero for each temperature .",
    "we finally used that the multicanonical algorithm allows us to calculate estimates for the spectral density : @xmath31 we can therefore construct the corresponding partition function for our all - atom model of ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 from these estimates by @xmath32 with @xmath33 the inverse temperature , @xmath34 .",
    "the complex solutions of the partition function determine the critical behavior of the model and were also studied by us .",
    "our peptide , ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 , is build up out of two chains of each 10 alanine residues connected by 5 glycine residues . in previous work @xcite we could show that polyalanine has a pronounced transition between a disordered coil phase and an ordered state in which the polymer forms an @xmath0-helix .",
    "for this reason , we expect formation of @xmath0-helices in our peptide , and the average number of helical residues @xmath35 is therefore one of the quantities that we have measured .",
    "@xmath35 is displayed in fig .  1 as a function of temperature , and we observe in this plot two temperature regions . at high temperature , few residues are found with backbone dihedral angles @xmath25 typical for an @xmath0-helix . on the other hand , at low temperatures we observe helix - formation , and",
    "almost all of the alanine residues are part of an @xmath0-helix , i.e. have backbone dihedral angles @xmath25 in the range ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the transition between the two temperature regions is sharp indicating the existence of a helix - coil transition .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath37 can be determined from the corresponding peak in the susceptibility @xmath38 which is ploted in the inset of fig .  1 , and we find the transition temperature @xmath39 k.    in previous work @xcite we could show that in polyalanine the formation of @xmath0-helices is related to a gain in potential energy . for this reason , we display in fig .",
    "2 the average total ecepp/2 energy @xmath40 and the thermodynamic averages of partial energies @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 of ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 as a function of temperature .",
    "as expected , we observe around our transition temperature @xmath37 a sharp decrease in the potential energy @xmath40 that is due to a corresponding decrease in the coulomb energy @xmath41 , lennard - jones energy @xmath42 and hydrogen - bond energy @xmath43 .",
    "the change in @xmath40 with temperature can be described by the specific heat @xmath45 which we display in fig .",
    "a pronounced change in energy with temperature corresponds to a peak in the specific heat .",
    "as one can see from fig .  3 ,",
    "we observe indeed a pronounced peak in the specific heat at a temperature @xmath46 k that is consistent with @xmath47 k , the temperature where the peak in the susceptibility is located .",
    "combining both values we obtain as our final estimate for the helix - coil transition temperature @xmath48 .",
    "however , we find in fig .  3 also",
    "a second , smaller peak in the specific heat at the lower temperature @xmath49 k indicating yet another transition .",
    "the sharp decrease in potential energy corresponding to this second peak is clearly visible in fig .  2 for the total energy @xmath40 , however , not for all of the partial energies . only the lennard - jones term @xmath42 exhibits also a signal for the second transition at @xmath50 .",
    "this energy term depends strongly on the overall size of the molecule and the change in this quantity indicates a transition between extended and compact structures .",
    "hence , we conjecture that the second peak in specific heat at the lower temperature @xmath50 is related to a transition between extended and compact structures .",
    "a possible measure for such a change is the average end - to - end distance @xmath51 .",
    "we define here @xmath52 as the distance between n of ala@xmath53 and o of ala@xmath54 , and plot this quantity in fig .  4 .",
    "we observe that this quantity decreases with decreasing temperature . below the helix - coil transition @xmath37",
    "the decrease slows down and the curve becomes almost flat at a value of @xmath55   indicating that there is little further change in the compactness of the molecule .",
    "however , at temperature @xmath50 the end - to - end distance decreases again sharply towards a new value @xmath56  . hence , @xmath50 marks the folding of the molecule into a defined compact structure with the two terminal ends of the peptide close together .",
    "the transition between extended and a more compact structure can also be seen when we display the free energy landscape of our peptide as a function of helicity @xmath23 and end - to - end distance @xmath24 .",
    "at the temperature @xmath57 k ( which is essentially the helix - coil transition temperature @xmath58 k ) the free energy landscape ( displayed in fig .",
    "5a ) is flat over a large range of values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath59 contour line surrounds a region where the helicity can take values between @xmath60 and the end - to - end distance values between @xmath61 , allowing the system to move freely between extended and compact configurations , and between helical and coil configurations . on the other hand , at the second and lower temperature @xmath62 k ( which is essentially the folding transition temperature @xmath49 k ) the free energy grows rapidly with decreasing helicity @xmath23 favoring configuration in a small strip with @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the plot of the free energy landscape in fig .",
    "5b is limited to values @xmath64 of the helicity . here",
    ", two regions of minimal free energy can be seen ( marked by the 3 @xmath65 contour lines ) .",
    "the first minima is found at values of @xmath24 between 5 and 10    and @xmath66 characterising compact structures . a second region with slightly lower free energy ( see the 1 @xmath65 contour line )",
    "is found at much larger values of @xmath24 between 35 and 40   and @xmath67 indicating a long stretched @xmath0-helix .",
    "both local free energy minima are separated by free energy barriers of @xmath68 @xmath65 that can be overcome by thermal fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "configurations with helicity @xmath69 are suppressed by free energy differences of more than 30 @xmath65 .",
    "examples for the structures corresponding to the two free energy minima are plotted in fig .",
    "6 . the first one , displayed in fig .",
    "6a is the configuration with lowest energy ever found in our multicanonical simulation of 8,000,000 sweeps and corresponds to the region in the free - energy landscape at values of @xmath24 between 5 and 10 and @xmath66 .",
    "this conformation ( ` a ' ) consists out of two helixes ( made up out of the alanine residues ) connected by a turn ( build out of the flexible glycine residues ) towards a u - turn - like structure that is consistent with the small value of the end - to - end distance @xmath24 observed in fig .  4 for temperatures below @xmath50 .",
    "for reference we show in fig .",
    "6b also the configuration ( ` b ' ) where all 25 residues are part of an @xmath0-helix and which corresponds to the second local free - energy minimum in fig .",
    "5b at values of @xmath24 between 35 and 40   and @xmath67 .",
    "the dihedral angles of both configurations are listed in table 1 .",
    "7 displays the frequency of both configurations as a function of temperature . for @xmath70",
    "neither configuration ` a ' nor ` b ' are observed .",
    "below that temperature both structures appear with similar probability as long as the temperature is higher than @xmath50 . at @xmath71",
    "the probability to find the maximal helical structure ` b ' is with @xmath72 % highest and decreases after that with decreasing temperature . on the other hand",
    ", the frequency for the u - turn structure ` a ' continues to grow with decreasing temperature .",
    "this different behavior is due to the energy differences between both structures .",
    "the minimal energy conformation ` a ' has with @xmath73 kcal / mol a @xmath74 kcal / mol lower potential energy than the extended helix conformation ` b ' ( @xmath75 kcal / mol ) .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the lennard - jones terms : @xmath76",
    "kcal / mol for ` a ' vs. @xmath77 kcal / mol for ` b ' . the gain in @xmath78 is in part compensated by the hydrogen - bonding terms : @xmath79 kcal / mol for ` a ' vs. @xmath80 kcal / mol for ` b ' .",
    "coulomb and torsion energies differed little between the two configurations : @xmath81",
    "kcal / mol and @xmath82 kcal / mol for conformation ` a ' vs. @xmath83 kcal / mol and @xmath84 kcal / mol for conformation ` b ' .",
    "it is an interesting question whether our two observed transitions ( occuring in a finite and small system ) can be related to phase transitions which in a strict sense are defined only for macroscopic ( that is very large ) systems . in order to study this question",
    "we have calculated the complex zeros @xmath85 of the partition function @xmath86 of our molecule . in the case of a temperature driven phase transition",
    ", we expect that the complex zeros @xmath87 ( or at least the ones close to the real axis ) condense for large enough system size on a single line . as the system size increases",
    ", those zeros will move towards the positive real @xmath33-axis and the corresponding value is for large system size the inverse of the physical critical temperature @xmath88 .",
    "crucial information on phase transitions can be obtained from the way in which the first zero approaches the real @xmath33-axis .",
    "however , such an analysis depends on the extrapolation towards the infinite large system and does not allow characterization of the situation in small systems such as ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 .",
    "one possible extension of the above ideas to `` phase transitions '' in biological molecules and other small systems is the classification scheme by borrmann _",
    "_ @xcite . in this approach one",
    "computes the discrete line density of zeros as an average of the inverse distances between neighboring zeros , @xmath89 and approximates @xmath90 by a simple power law @xmath91 .",
    "taking the first four complex zeros , one obtains @xmath92 with a second parameter @xmath93 , related to the crossing angle of this line with the real axis , @xmath94/(\\tau_2 - \\tau_1)\\ , , \\label{gamma}\\ ] ] and following the classification scheme by grossmann and rosenhauer @xcite , phase transitions can now be classified according to the values of these two parameters : for @xmath95 and @xmath96 one has a phase transition of first order , it is of second order if @xmath97 and arbitrary @xmath93 , and for @xmath98 and arbitrary @xmath93 one has a higher order transition .",
    "we have evaluated the usefulness of this approach both for spin systems and polyalanine chains @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 are also listed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 , we find two lines of complex zeros .",
    "the corresponding first four zeros for each characteristic line are listed in table 2 .",
    "our error estimate is based on the jackknife method @xcite with 16 bins .",
    "these lines lead to two critical temperatures @xmath99 k and @xmath100 k ( estimated from the real part of @xmath33 ) that agree with the corresponding values @xmath101 k and @xmath102 k found by us above with different methods .    using these zeros",
    "we have calculated the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath93 that characterize in the borrmann _",
    "et al . _ approach phase transitions in small systems .",
    "for the first transition , at @xmath57 k , we find @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the errors reflect large fluctuations in the values of the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath93 that do not allow us to determine whether the helix - coil transition is a weak first order or a strong second order phase transition .",
    "this problem was also observed in our earlier work on polyalanine @xcite where we were also not able to establish clearly the order of the helix - coil transition .",
    "however , our results illustrate the strength of this transition that also leads to the pronounced peak in the specific heat observed in fig .",
    "3 , and suggest a nucleation mechanism for @xmath0-helix formation .",
    "our data are more decisive in the case of the second transition , at @xmath105 k , which marks the collapse and folding of the peptide . here",
    "we find @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "these values indicate a second - order transition which is consistent with what one would expect for a transition between extended and compact structures and imply that collapse and folding of the ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 is connected with long range correlations between the residues .",
    "our above analysis of the thermodynamics of our peptide suggests that ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 folds in a 2 step process .",
    "the first step is the formation of @xmath0-helices and can be characterized by a helix - coil transition temperature @xmath108 k. the formation of @xmath0-helices then restricts the possible configuration space .",
    "energetically most favorable is the folding of two @xmath0-helices ( made out of the alanine residues ) into a hairpin .",
    "this second step can be characterized by a lower folding temperature @xmath109 k. note that this folding temperature is in the biological relevant temperature regime while helix - formation can also happen at much higher temperatures .",
    "the above described two step folding of our artificial peptide is reminiscent of the well known framework @xcite and collision - diffusion model @xcite of folding which also propose that local elements of native local secondary structure form independently of tertiary structure .",
    "these elements diffuse until they collide and coalesce to give a tertiary structure . in our case ,",
    "the temperature region of @xmath110 k is the one where the thermal energy of the molecule does not allow coalescing of the helix - fragments that therefore form and decay .",
    "some stabilization happens when these fragments try to form one extended helix , however , the inherent flexibility of the glycine residues , connecting the two alanine chains , and the gain in lennard - jones energy lead instead at temperatures below @xmath50 to a u - turn - like bundle of two ( antiparallel ) @xmath0-helices connected by a turn of glycine residues as the most stable structure .",
    "note that this picture is consistent with energy landscape theory and funnel concept @xcite .",
    "5b depicts the appearance of a folding funnel at @xmath62 k towards our `` native structure '' ` a ' . the competing structure ` b ' , that at this temperature has a slightly higher ( @xmath111 ) free energy ( see the 1 @xmath65 contour line for structure ` a ' that is missing for conformer ` b ' ) , acts as a local trap .",
    "however , the free energy barriers of @xmath112 can be overcome at this temperature by thermal fluctuations .",
    "below that temperature the relative weight of structure ` b ' decreases ( see fig.7 ) and its free energy difference to ` a ' increases : the energy landscape becomes even more funnel like ( data not shown ) .",
    "the energy landscape of fig .",
    "5b allows for a multitude of folding pathways that all , however , follow the above described two - step process .",
    "an interesting question is how general the above obtained results are .",
    "a direct comparison with experimental data is difficult since solvent effects were neglected in the simulation of ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 and most experiments study solvated peptides .",
    "an exception are the techniques developed by jarrold and collaborators for examination of gas - phase conformations of proteins and peptides @xcite .",
    "an experimental study of ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 using these techniques is now planed .",
    "the authors are not aware of experimental results for the solvated peptide . in order to compare our work with experiments of other short helical peptides",
    "@xcite , we therefore started now simulations of ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 where the solvation effects are approximated by a solvent accessible surface term @xcite .",
    "this will allows us also to test the dependency of our results on the solvation model . simulating another , slightly more complicated , artifical peptide , ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1",
    "that presumably will fold in a three - helix bundle , will allow in addition a direct comparison with recent experimental work by myers and oas @xcite where the relation between helix - formation and folding was studied for the 58-residue b domain of protein a.",
    "in summary , we have performed multicanonical simulations with high statistics of a simple artificial peptide , the 25 residue ala@xmath1-gly@xmath2-ala@xmath1 .",
    "we found that this peptide folds into a specific structure that is determined solely by the intrinsic properties of the molecule ( since solvent interactions are absent in our simulations . in gas - phase ,",
    "the peptide exhibits two characteristic transitions . at @xmath48 k",
    "we observed a helix - coil transition that is either a weak first order transition or a strong second order transition .",
    "our results indicate that there is a second transition at @xmath49 k , the folding transition , that is second order - like .",
    "these results suggest that folding of this peptide in gas - phase is a two - step process . in a first step ,",
    "the alanine residues form independently helical segments which then afterwards in a second step assemble to a u - turn like structure of two antiparallel @xmath0-helices connected by a turn . by using an implicit solvent model in our simulations",
    "we started now to investigate whether the final structure or this two - step process changes in the present of water .",
