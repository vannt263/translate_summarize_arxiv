    "dry granular materials exhibit a large range of dynamical behaviours ( for a general review see @xcite ) .",
    "an assembly of non - cohesive macroscopic particles confined in a box can be considered as a solid , but will start flowing when submitted to a large enough shear stress .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism can be very different , depending on the shearing rate imposed and the resulting density of the material .",
    "upon rapid shearing or shaking , a fluidized state is reached in which the stress is transfered from the boundaries to the bulk through binary collisions .",
    "this dynamics is well understood under the scope of the so - called kinetic theory @xcite . in many practical situations",
    "however , gravity maintains a high density in the material so that the stress is mainly transfered by rubbing friction between particles in persistent contact . in this regime ,",
    "all relative motion between particles tend to be confined to very narrow regions of the material , making a continuous approach inadequate . within these so - called shear band , each particle",
    "is submitted to large forces which rapidly fluctuate as the packing environment and the associated force network evolve .",
    "the flow is driven by collective and jerky moves of large sets of particles , hold together by transient force chains .",
    "although this regime is relevant to soil mechanics and geology ( earthquakes and pyroclastic flows for example@xcite ) and important in industrial applications ( granular transport in hoppers and pipes ) , a satisfactory description is to date lacking for such fully developed dense flows@xcite .",
    "a strong experimental effort has however been seen recently to probe the grain - scale dynamics within these shear bands , which now provides a good test for physical models : two series of experiments have been performed independently on 2-d and 3-d couette cells .",
    "a collection of particles is confined between a fixed outer cylinder and a rotating inner one . in the 2-d experiment ,",
    "the system consists of one monolayer of disc - like particles squeezed between 2 horizontal plates . in this geometry ,",
    "a shear band is always present at the vicinity of the rotating inner cylinder . by different techniques ,",
    "the authors were able to precisely measure the decay of the average particle velocity from the inner moving wall to the immobile region towards the outer cylinder@xcite .",
    "surprisingly enough , the two results were found to be significantly different : in 2-d the velocity @xmath0 decayed with the distance @xmath1 to the inner wall according to an exponential law , whereas in 3-d , the velocity profile was well fitted by a gaussian centered on the surface of the wall .",
    "these results showed to be robust for polydisperse or highly irregularly shaped particles .",
    "for round and monodisperse grains however , a layering effect and a strong slippage between adjacent layers were observed which result in more complicated profiles .    in this note",
    "we will focus on the gaussian / exponential behaviours as the spatial dimension changes . because a gaussian form can not be derived from a local differential equation ( for example see @xcite )",
    ", the 3-d velocity profile suggests that a purely local model would fail to describe it .",
    "here we introduce non - local effects by postulating a correlation length in the particles displacements which depends on their position within the shear band .",
    "this approach comes to modeling the flow as a succession of transient fractures allowing the coherent motion of clusters of various sizes .",
    "this hypothesis alone allows us to produce an average velocity profile consistent with what was observed in both 2- and 3-d .",
    "finally , we will show that the probability distribution and the force spectrum derived from this model are in good agreement with experimental results found in the literature .",
    "we consider a plane shear geometry : a wall is moving at a constant speed @xmath2 along a half - space of granular material .",
    "the flow velocity is assumed to vanish far from the moving wall ( see figure [ schema ] ) .",
    "we impose a no slip condition at the wall so that @xmath3 ( this boundary condition mimics a classical experimental realization where the first layer of particles is glued onto the moving wall ) . in our scheme , the motion of each particle can be decomposed into successive steps of typical length @xmath4 occurring at velocity @xmath5 . between two steps",
    ", the particle remains immobile .",
    "one grain can thus either be at rest or move together with the wall .",
    "the interface between moving and static particles defines a failure surface for the pack .",
    "we define @xmath6 as the stationary probability of a failure surface to be present , per unit of time and length ( in units of particle diameter ) along the @xmath7-axis , at a distance @xmath1 from the moving wall ( as in ref @xcite ) .",
    "although a reduction in granular density by roughly @xmath8 - the so - called reynolds dilatancy - is known to accompany shear flow , we will first consider a uniform density .",
    "both two and three dimensional geometries will be addressed ; @xmath9 will denote in the following the space dimension .",
    "a fracture will either be a line in 2-d , or a plane in 3-d .",
    "= 14truecm    we first consider the dynamics of the first freely moving layer in the region @xmath10 . as the wall moves by a distance @xmath4 in a time @xmath11",
    ", a particle located in this layer is either dragged by the wall producing a failure further away , or stays immobile so that a crack develops at exactly @xmath12 . assuming a coulomb - type slip condition , the probability of the latter depends on the ratio of the normal and shear stress to which is submitted the particle during the time period @xmath13 .",
    "based on this mechanical consideration , and by analogy with thermally activated processes , pouliquen & al@xcite have proposed an expression for the probability @xmath14 of slippage between @xmath15 particles from @xmath15 consecutive layers in a granular material slowly flowing down a pipe . in their picture",
    ", the spatial stress fluctuation induced by the randomness of the packing structure plays the role of a temperature , allowing them to apply classical rate processes theory@xcite . in the quasi - static regime",
    "we address here , the average shear and normal stress are uniform in the material since each layer is constantly in mechanical equilibrium . in the limit of uniform density , it is therefore natural to assume a uniform value for @xmath14 .",
    "although , the derivation of the slippage rate not only requires the knowledge of the static probability @xmath14 . a typical fluctuation time - scale , related to the flow itself also needs to be introduced . this time - scale corresponds to the relaxation time of the stress network around the chosen particle . for a particle in the first layer ,",
    "the only relevant time - scale is @xmath13 which is the time needed for a shear strain of @xmath16 to be established .",
    "we can now write down the rate of slippage at the wall @xmath17 as :    @xmath18    @xmath19 is a constant introduced for normalization .",
    "it should be noted that we implicitly suppose a clear separation between the successive hopping events or equivalently that @xmath20 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath6 away from the wall is based on a self - similar argument .",
    "we postulate that , for a yielding event to occur at a distance @xmath1 from the wall , the crack must extend radially over a length of the order @xmath1 .",
    "hence the shearing of the material at a distance @xmath1 from the wall requires the coherent motion of a solid cluster of size @xmath1 in all directions .",
    "this cluster is dragged by the wall over a distance @xmath4 as one solid object , in the same way as was the single particle from the first layer ( see figure [ schema ] ) .",
    "this self - similar description of the cluster size is introduced to account for the perturbation of the force network in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "chain forces , which are responsible for the rigidity of the dense pack , are screened by the proximity of a solid boundary .",
    "independent motion of particles are thus only allowed in the vicinity of the wall whereas the bulk behaves as a solid body .",
    "we note that an identical scaling have been successfully postulated in ( at least ) 2 very different contexts to describe the effect of a wall on dynamical structures . to estimate the prandtl mixing layer in turbulent flows near a wall , the characteristic length of the vortices are assumed to increase like the distance to the boundary layer .",
    "the derivation of polymer dynamics near a wall in the semi - dilute regime also assumes that the ` blob ' size ( the dynamical coherence length of the monomers ) grows like the distance to the wall@xcite .",
    "as the width of the shear band in granular flows is always of the order of @xmath21 bead diameters , regardless of the bead size , the bead diameter appears to be the only relevant length - scale in this problem .",
    "a linear increase of the coherence length with the distance to the wall is therefore the only reasonable choice may have to be used for a different geometry .",
    "for example , the stationary dense granular flow along an inclined plane seems to exhibit a characteristic length @xmath22 depending on the inclination and roughness of the inclined plane@xcite .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the coherence length in this case for a further study . ] .",
    "for simplicity we will take exactly @xmath1 as the coherence length in the following .",
    "given this general picture , the scaling analysis follows : we define @xmath23 as the number of particles involved in a crack developing at a distance @xmath1 : @xmath24    the probability for this set of particles to become simultaneously unstable is @xmath25 , whereas the time - scale @xmath26 of the stress fluctuations experienced by the cluster of size @xmath1 reads : @xmath27    the scaling for @xmath26 was made consistent with the criterion used for the first layer : @xmath26 corresponds to a shear strain of 1 for the cluster of size @xmath1 .",
    "two different time - scales are thus involved in the dynamics of these blocks : a rapid one , @xmath13 associated with the release of the stress when a yielding occurs ; a slower one , @xmath26 which characterizes the stress fluctuations experienced by the particles at a distance @xmath1 from the wall",
    ".    finally , a particle located at @xmath28 has @xmath29 possible locations along the crack and the expression for @xmath6 eventually reads :    @xmath30    when yielding occurs at a distance @xmath1 from the wall , every particle below @xmath28 moves over a distance @xmath4 whereas no motion occurs above @xmath28 .",
    "such an event represents a discontinuity in the instantaneous velocity profile ( the velocity is @xmath2 below the crack and @xmath31 above during a time @xmath13 ) .",
    "the constitutive differential equation for the stationary mean velocity profile @xmath32 thus reads :    @xmath33    with the boundary conditions @xmath3 and @xmath34 ..    for @xmath35 , we obtain : @xmath36    which by integration gives an exponential velocity profile @xmath37 :    @xmath38    for @xmath39 , it gives : @xmath40    so that the velocity profile @xmath41 is gaussian :    @xmath42    the function @xmath6 then reads respectively in two and three dimensions :    @xmath43    although a few hypothesis have been used to derive these results , one should note that the major assumption is that the persistence length of the fractures increases linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "this argument alone produces the main behaviour of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the rescaling of the stress fluctuation time - scale @xmath26 only controls the pre - factor of the exponential and gaussian velocity profiles .",
    "a correction could also arise from a spatial dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , the shear induced density profile neglected in the present approach might affect the uniformity of the average shear and normal stress per particle within the shear band .",
    "considering that @xmath14 is a decreasing function of the density , this correction may increase the velocity decay and narrow the shear band .",
    "this may explain deviations from the gaussian and exponential profiles observed in experiments with rounded and monodisperse particles where the largest density gradients are present .",
    "however , an exact solution of ( [ eqdif ] ) for a general @xmath14 is highly non - trivial and should be investigated in a further work .",
    "in addition to the velocity profiles , the knowledge of the function @xmath6 gives appropriate information for computing other properties of the flow such as the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the forces acting on the wall as well as the power spectrum of this signal .",
    "these two quantities have been experimentally studied in both two and three dimensional granular shear flows@xcite . in the latter experiment ,",
    "the normal force on the bottom of a shear cell was monitored using a force transducer which could accommodate a large number ( from 4 to 100 ) of particles .",
    "the resulting measurement corresponded to the integrated value of many individual contact forces .",
    "the measured force signal f(t ) appeared as a series of narrow peaks of various heights . to compare these results with the present model",
    ", we suppose that each peak is the signature of a failure in the structure of the sheared pack . assuming that the slippage of one grain releases a given force , the motion of a cluster of size @xmath1 produces a peak of intensity @xmath44 proportional to @xmath29 , or equivalently :    @xmath45    these peaks last for a time @xmath13 and are uncorrelated in time . > from here , we can derive the form of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath46 by identifying @xmath47 with @xmath48 in @xmath6 :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the mean force of the distribution .",
    "surprisingly enough , these pdf s are the same for 2- and 3-d .",
    "both agree with experimental observations at large forces@xcite .",
    "the behaviour at low forces is not probed by experiments although it may have more complicated features .",
    "one may note that eq .",
    "( [ densite ] ) is formally identical to what has been observed for large forces on individual particles in a compressed static array@xcite .",
    "but this static distribution would narrow upon spatial averaging .",
    "by contrast , the width of the force distribution in the present description is insensitive to the integration area in agreement with experimental observations . in the continuously sheared regime ,",
    "the wide force distribution arises from the coherence in the force release induced by the sudden motion of large clusters , and not from the purely static force distribution on individual particles .",
    "the power spectrum of the force fluctuations can also be obtained in this description as follows : the power signal is decomposed into a stochastic succession of peaks of height @xmath51 and width @xmath13 .",
    "the period @xmath52 between two successive pulses of amplitude @xmath51 is simply the inverse of the rate @xmath6 . for a given @xmath1 , and",
    "therefore a given @xmath44 , the signal is the so - called telegraph noise , for which the power spectrum @xmath53 reads@xcite :    @xmath54 @xmath55    therefore , since failures at different distances from the wall are uncorrelated , the power spectrum @xmath56 for the overall signal is given by the sum :    @xmath57    @xmath56 exhibits qualitatively the same behaviour for 2 and 3 dimensions , dominated by lorentzian - like functions ( see figure ( [ spectrum ] ) ) . for frequencies much larger than @xmath58 , the power spectrum behaves like @xmath59 as observed in experiments@xcite ; this is a direct consequence of the stochastic description of the process . on the other hand ,",
    "the expression ( [ power ] ) displays a well - defined non - zero limit as @xmath60 . by comparison , the power spectra measured in @xcite exhibit a continuous , although small increase as @xmath60 .",
    "= 14 truecm",
    "we have proposed a stochastic description of slowly sheared granular material that can capture the main characteristics of the flow : the average velocity profiles and force fluctuations in 2 and 3 spatial dimensions .",
    "we want to underline the relatively good agreement with experimental data with regards to the small number of ingredients introduced .",
    "in particular , we ignored the existence of granular density variations along the direction normal to the flow which may induce significant corrections . the crucial assumption of this model lies in the self - similar structure of moving clusters that rapidly form and disappear as the material flows . this assumption has been qualitatively suggested by the mere observation of 3-d couette flows watched from below through a transparent bottom plate where the jerky and multi - scale dynamics is clearly visible .",
    "we hope that this tentative description will motivate further quantitative investigations to probe the nature of space and time correlations in the motion of neighboring particles in such systems .    here",
    "we have focused on recent experimental data in order to test this self - similar model but we think that this simple description of dense granular dynamics as a super - imposition of coherent moves can be extended to many more geometries and processes than just plane shear .",
    "the issue is to correctly prescribe the coherence length mapping @xmath61 , and describe the probability @xmath6 for each realization . in particular",
    ", we anticipate that the existence of multiple relaxation times recently demonstrated in granular compaction experiments could be associated with rearrangements over different length - scales during the relaxation of the packing structure . to that extent , this model may offer a clue to understand the numerous features that granular material share with glassy liquids below the glass transition ( aging , slow relaxation , jamming ) .    it is a pleasure to thank d. mueth , h. jaeger , s. nagel , t. witten and l. kadanoff for many interesting and stimulating discussions .",
