    "the first ever exact solution of einstein s field equation for a compact object in static equilibrium was obtained by schwarzschild in 1916 .",
    "the static isotropic and anisotropic exact solutions describing stellar - type configurations have continuously attracted the interest of physicists herrera et al .",
    "tolman @xcite has proposed an easy way to solve einstein s field equations by introducing an additional equation necessary to give a determinate problem in the form of some ad hoc relation between the components of metric tensor . according to this methodology ,",
    "tolman @xcite has obtained eight solutions of the field equations , and his important approach still continues in obtaining the exact interior solutions of the gravitational field equations for fluid spheres .",
    "buchdahl @xcite proposed a famous bound on the mass radius ratio of relativistic fluid spheres is @xmath0 , which is an important contribution in order to study the stability of the fluid spheres .",
    "also ivanov @xcite has given the upper bound of the red shift for realistic anisotropic star models which can not be exceed the values @xmath1 provided the tangential pressure satisfies a strong energy condition @xmath2 and when the tangential pressure satisfies the dominated energy condition @xmath3 .",
    "buchdahl @xcite has also obtained a non - singular exact solution by choosing a particular choice of the mean density inside the star .",
    "the theoretical investigations of realistic fluid models indicate that stellar matter may be anisotropic at least in certain density ranges @xmath4 gm/@xmath5 ( ruderman @xcite and canuto @xcite ) and radial pressure may not be equal to the tangential pressure of stellar structure .",
    "the existence of a solid core due to presence of the anisotropy in the pressure was thought of by type-3a super - fluid ( kippenhahm and weigert @xcite ) , different form of phase transitions ( sokolov @xcite ) or by others physical phenomena . on the scale of galaxies , binney and tremaine",
    "@xcite have considered anisotropies in spherical galaxies , from a purely newtonian point of view .",
    "the mixture of two gases ( e.g. ionized hydrogen and electrons or monatomic hydrogen ) can be described formally as an anisotropic fluid ( letelier @xcite and bayin @xcite).the importance of equations of state for relativistic anisotropic fluid spheres have been investigated by generalizing the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to include the effects of anisotropy ( bowers and liang @xcite ) .",
    "their study shows that anisotropy may have non - negligible effects on parameters such as maximum equilibrium mass and surface red - shift . the relativistic anisotropic neutron star models at high densities by means of several simple assumptions showed that there is no limiting mass of neutron stars for arbitrary large anisotropy which is studied by heintzmann and hillebrandt @xcite .",
    "however maximum mass of a neutron star still lies beyond 3 - 4 @xmath6 .",
    "also the solutions for an anisotropic fluid sphere with uniform density and variable density are studied by maharaj and maartens @xcite and gokhroo and mehra @xcite , respectively .",
    "most the astronomical objects have variable density . therefore , interior solutions of anisotropic fluid spheres with variable density are more realistic physically .",
    "many workers have obtained different exact solutions for isotropic and anisotropic fluid spheres in different contexts ( delgaty and lake @xcite , dev and gleiser @xcite , komathiraj and maharaj @xcite , thirukkanesh and ragel @xcite , sunzu et al.@xcite , harko and mak @xcite , mak and harko @xcite , chaisi and maharaj @xcite , maurya and gupta @xcite , feroze and siddiqui @xcite , pant et al .",
