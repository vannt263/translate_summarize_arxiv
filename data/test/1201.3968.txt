    "as is well known , the standard model , with an elementary higgs doublet field , suffers from the problem of quadratic divergences when radiative corrections , due to the loops of fermions , the top quark in particular , to the mass of the higgs boson is calculated .",
    "this problem is often referred to as the hierarchy problem , as we require an artificial fine tuning between the induced radiative mass , which is of the order of the cut - off scale , e.g. , @xmath9 , and the counterterm to produce a mass of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "this tempts us to speculate that the higgs boson may in fact be composite .",
    "the simplest implementation of this idea is top - quark condensation @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that this compositeness by itself is not sufficient to remove the problem of quadratic divergences , and fine tuning is still required in the simpler approaches to top - quark condensation .",
    "the problem of divergences can only be artificial , because the same loop corrections , applied to the mass of the goldstone bosons , produce a similar quadratic divergence , whereas the goldstone theorem guarantees that spontaneous symmetry breaking results in massless goldstone bosons .",
    "this suggests that these quadratic divergences are an artifact , and will vanish if the condition of current conservation is implemented properly .",
    "for example , the approach of chesterman , king and ross @xcite uses the vanishing of the mass of the goldstone boson as a consistency check , and is able to obtain sensible values for the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "a more direct investigation into this point regarding current conservation was made by gribov in ref .",
    "@xcite , and his results are in quantitative agreement with ref .  @xcite . in that paper , he implemented the symmetry condition , somewhat by force , by requiring that the goldstone - boson self - energy vanishes in the soft limit .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is then obtained by subtracting off the goldstone - boson self - energy , leading to the following pagels  stokar - type equation for the mass of the higgs boson : @xmath10 this gives the mass @xmath11  gev for the higgs boson using the top - quark mass @xmath12  gev and @xmath13 as input .",
    "gribov s cut - off @xmath14 is given by the u(1)@xmath3 landau pole , @xmath15  gev , but the results are relatively insensitive to the value of the cut - off scale .",
    "this value of @xmath0 is not far from the recent lhc results @xcite which suggest @xmath16  gev .",
    "it is worth noting here that eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_gribov_higgs_mass ] ) is general and is independent of the physics that causes the cut - off .",
    "our questions are the following .",
    "first , what may be the justification for this procedure , in particular the mechanism for the cancellation of the divergences ? second , whether there may be correction terms due to the loops of goldstone and higgs bosons in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_gribov_higgs_mass ] ) .    concerning the first question , we shall show in this paper that the quadratic divergences are proportional to the tadpole and therefore vanish when the vacuum is stable .",
    "although this statement must be independent of the basis , it is most easily verified by defining the goldstone bosons as the divergence of the weak current so that derivative couplings do not arise .",
    "our analysis is quite general in the sense that no new interactions are introduced up to the uv cut - off scale .",
    "this procedure has the well - known phenomenological disadvantage that the mass @xmath5 of the @xmath17 boson is predicted to be too low for fixed @xmath6 or , equivalently , @xmath6 is predicted to be too large for fixed @xmath5 .",
    "this is partially alleviated by taking large @xmath14 such as , as in gribov s scenario , the u(1)@xmath3 landau pole .",
    "even this is not sufficient and , as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , more uv contribution is required , which may be , one would naturally guess , due to strong dynamics at near and above the cut - off .",
    "the methods of our analysis are analogous to those in ref .",
    "@xcite that are worked out in the context of anti - ferromagnetism .",
    "the second of the questions above is also addressed within this framework , and we find that the correction to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_gribov_higgs_mass ] ) is large and negative .    as an explanation of our framework ,",
    "we implement current conservation by requiring the vanishing of the ward ",
    "takahashi identities .",
    "this fixes the bosonic three - point and four - point couplings .",
    "in other words , the shape of the higgs potential is fixed by current conservation , and this turns out to be of the same form as that of the standard model .",
    "we then implement the vacuum - stability condition , namely that the higgs @xmath18 one - point function , or the tadpole , vanishes .",
    "note that the cancellation of the tadpole , which is imposed as the cancellation among the top - quark , goldstone - boson and higgs - boson loops , is by itself an independent condition on the symmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "this yields @xmath19 which implies @xmath4  gev in the u(1)@xmath3 scenario , if we only include the qcd part of the running .",
    "this is very close to the lhc value , but this remarkable success should not be taken too seriously , because this condition will be affected by the renormalization , due to the u(1)@xmath3 interaction , of the top - quark mass at near the landau pole .    it should be noted that this extra condition on the higgs mass , in principle , completely fixes the symmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "that is , all three masses , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 , are fixed for given values of the cut - off scale and gauge couplings .",
    "this provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem and , indeed , we obtain a large hierarchy that is comparable with the actual hierarchy between the uv and ewsb scales .",
    "the form of the uv theory does not affect our analysis at the present level of approximation , so long as the symmetry is spontaneously broken by a uv condensate which exists only at high energies .",
    "this requires a supercritically strong uv interaction , and a natural candidate is gribov s u(1)@xmath3 scenario .",
    "we discuss the physics of this scenario .",
    "tadpole cancellation in bosonic self - energy was , in part , discussed by gribov himself in the context of chiral symmetry breaking in ref .",
    "however , he imposes tadpole cancellation there by introducing a boson  boson  quark  quark term ( e.g. , eqn .  ( 132 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to cancel the anomalous term in the ward ",
    "takahashi identity associated with compton scattering .",
    "one problem in doing so is that this will lead to the necessity of introducing an infinite number of @xmath20-boson  quark  quark couplings .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the context of anti - ferromagnetism , we proposed a more economical mechanism which also seems to us to be more natural . here ,",
    "only the three - point and four - point couplings among the goldstone and higgs bosons are needed , and these couplings are fixed by symmetry conditions such as the ward  takahashi identities .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the couplings are consistent with the standard - model - like quartic higgs potential . in the low - energy effective theory ,",
    "the phenomenology is identical to that of the standard model , at least insofar as the couplings to the bosons and the top quark are concerned . as for the other fermionic yukawa couplings ,",
    "it is natural to assume that they are as given by the standard model though , strictly speaking , other possibilities can not be ruled out .",

    "the dashed line stands for one of the three goldstone bosons @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",

    "<S> we show that quadratic divergences in top - quark condensation are cancelled when the tadpoles cancel . </S>",
    "<S> this latter cancellation is naturally implemented as the cancellation among the top - quark , goldstone and higgs contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the bosonic correction terms to gribov s mass formula for the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> these reduce the prediction for @xmath0 from @xmath1  gev to @xmath2  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the tadpole cancellation condition by itself is an independent condition on the mass of the higgs boson which , in gribov s u(1)@xmath3 scenario , yields @xmath4  gev with large theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we are able to obtain all three masses , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 , in @xmath7  mev to @xmath8  tev energy range as a function of the cut - off scale and the gauge couplings only . </S>"
