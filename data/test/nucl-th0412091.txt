    "in making theories of nuclear binding energies (  mass formulas \" ) , there are invariably parameters that are determined by fitting the experimental data .",
    "if the fitting parameters are not defined properly , they may be underconstrained by the data , causing problems in making the fit .",
    "this is the situation for the skyrme parameterization of the self - consistent mean - field theory ( scmf ) of binding energies , also called density - functional theory . while methods for dealing with underconstrained parameters are well known , to our knowledge there has not been a critical analysis of the skyrme parameterization .",
    "we shall show here that the sensitive degrees of freedom in the skyrme energy functional are very similar to those of the liquid drop model , except for the spin - orbit interaction . when the parameter space is restricted to those degrees of freedom ,",
    "linear methods can be applied to make a considerable reduction in the effort required for a search .",
    "we show how this works in the next section , refitting various parameterizations from the literature .",
    "a second way to reduce the effort in evaluating theories is to use a more economical norm for the fit .",
    "usually one makes a least - squares fit to the binding energies , i.e. using as a norm the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . ) average of the residual difference @xmath0 between theory and experiment , @xmath1 this requires calculating all nuclei .",
    "an alternative is the the chebyshev norm , used in making a _",
    "minimax fit_. it allows one to screen theories and their improvements taking only the information on a small set of nuclei , the  worst cases \" of the baseline theory . by calling attention to these cases",
    ", it could also be helpful to experimentalists choosing which nuclei to study , and to theorists searching for missing ingredients in the baseline theory .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the minimax method @xcite , but it only rarely used in physics @xcite .",
    "we describe the method in sect .",
    "iii below , applying it to the liquid drop model as a simple exercise and then to scmf .",
    "we also mention that another norm somewhat between the least squares and the c - norm has been proposed for fitting nuclear binding energies @xcite .    in our discussion below , the bethe - weizscker semiempirical mass formula will provide a convenient calibration point on the theory . for reference",
    ", the formula is given by @xcite [ ld ] b = a_v a - a_s a^2/3 - a_c z^2a^1/3 - a_a ( n - z)^2 4 a + , where @xmath2 is the ( positive ) binding energy of the nucleus @xmath3 .",
    "the skyrme energy functional in its present form @xcite has 10 linear parameters and one nonlinear parameter , the exponent @xmath4 of the density - dependent interaction .",
    "we shall only fit the linear coefficients , holding @xmath4 fixed . in practice , the spin - orbit interaction is often assumed to have a specific isospin structure .",
    "this reduces the number of linear parameters to nine .",
    "pairing is an indispensable ingredient in the theory but is outside the scope of the skyrme energy functional .",
    "we include pairing following the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite , using a lipkin - nogami treatment of bcs pairing with a surface - enhanced zero - range pairing interaction .",
    "the fits are only done on even - even nuclei , so the dependence of the fit on the binding energies would be very much reduced anyway .",
    "we represent skyrme energy functional as in ref .",
    "@xcite with interaction energy density given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter and @xmath7 is a function of the one - body densities .",
    "the specific forms of the @xmath7 needed for time - reversal invariant densities are given in table i.    [ skyrme - def ]    .skyrme energy functional in the @xmath8-parameterization .",
    "the label @xmath9 is expanded into a integer @xmath10 and an isospin label @xmath11 .",
    "the isoscalar and isovector densities are @xmath12 and other densities are the same as defined in ref . @xcite . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "fitting nuclear binding energies with theories based on quantum many - body theory is a challenging task , partly due to the large data set that needs to be computed .",
    "we believe that work in developing such theories can be reduced by using the chebyshev norm as we have illustrated . to encourage this effort , our computer program that carries out the minimax fits is available on the web @xcite .",
    "an issue still remains of which set of critical nuclei is best for testing new theoretical ideas .",
    "unfortunately , each skyrme parameterization points to a different set .",
    "we believe that there are clusters of nuclei that come out close to the c - norm limit , and that it should nt be so significant which set is used , as long as all the nuclei of some critical set are included . for definiteness , we propose using the sly4 set of five nuclei , since it has a variety of types with a clear example of a doubly magic nucleus .    for either the r.m.s . or the c - norm , the results of our refitting answers a basic question about the accuracy of scmf as applied to nuclear binding energies .",
    "namely , how does the quality of scmf fits including single - particle quantum mechanics compare with the liquid drop model which has no quantum mechanics at all ? comparing on the even - even nuclei in the 2003 mass table , we found that the scmf can double the accuracy for the r.m.s .",
    "norm and do somewhat better for the c - norm .",
    "the nominal number of skyrme parameters is more than twice the number of liquid drop parameters , but in fact all but about four could have been chosen from other considerations .",
    "it is of course reassuring that the scmf is a more predictive theory , and now the challenge is find good ways to extend it .",
