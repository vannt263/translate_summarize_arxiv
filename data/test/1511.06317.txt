    "diffractive scattering through strong interactions without any large momentum transfer has historically been described in terms of the exchange of a pomeron , a virtual hadron - like object with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the regge approach  @xcite of the pre - qcd era provides a working phenomenology to describe such processes in a hadron basis since no parton structure is resolved .",
    "the idea @xcite to introduce a hard scale in a diffractive process opened the possibility to examine these processes at the level of quarks and gluons in the modern framework of qcd .",
    "the discovery of such _ diffractive hard scattering _ was made by the ua8 experiment @xcite by observing high-@xmath3 jets in single diffractive events in @xmath4 collisions at cern .",
    "many other hard processes in diffractive events have been observed later on , for a review see e.g.@xcite .",
    "of special importance are the measurements of diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) at the electron - proton collider hera @xcite , where the well understood point - like electromagnetic interaction probes the parton structure in the diffractive reaction mechanism .",
    "this has resulted in theoretical descriptions of data based on essentially two different approaches , one being pomeron exchange in regge phenomenology and the other colour screening via soft gluon exchange in qcd .",
    "the pomeron approach starts with the initial proton state fluctuating in a soft non - perturbative process into a proton and a pomeron .",
    "the latter is assumed to have a partonic structure which is probed by the momentum transfer @xmath5 of the deep inelastic photon exchange to produce the hadronic final state , well separated in rapidity from the final state proton carrying most of the longitudinal momentum of the beam proton .",
    "hera data on ddis can then be described @xcite as a product of an effective pomeron flux factor from regge phenomenology and deep inelastic scattering on the pomeron having parametrised parton density functions ( pdf ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may parametrise diffractive structure functions without an explicit pomeron flux but instead being conditionally dependent on the momentum of the final proton .    however , this approach is not universal in the sense that such parametrisations do not reproduce diffractive hard scattering data in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "for example , such pomeron pdfs overestimate substantially the cross - sections for diffractive hard scattering processes , such as production of jets or @xmath6 , at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "this has called for introducing a gap survival suppression factor @xmath7 , which can be given a qualitative theoretical motivation but which is difficult to calculate quantitatively .",
    "the colour exchange approach starts instead with the hard scattering process and then adds softer gluon exchanges to achieve the effective colour singlet exchange in diffractive processes .",
    "thus , the underlying hard process is assumed to be the same as in the corresponding non - diffractive process and its momenta naturally not affected by other exchanges at much lower momentum transfer scales .",
    "however , the formation of confining colour fields may well be affected by the softer gluon exchanges and thereby the hadronisation process such that a different distribution of the final state hadrons emerges .",
    "for example , when different colour singlet string - fields emerge separated in rapidity they will hadronise into two hadron systems separated by a rapidity gap with no hadrons .",
    "a simple , but phenomenologically rather successful model of this kind is the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model  @xcite added to the lepto @xcite and pythia @xcite monte - carlo event generators . a large variety of diffractive data",
    "could then be reproduced with essentially the same value of a single new parameter , introduced to give the probability for exchange a soft colour octet gluon between any pair of partons .",
    "this colour exchange alter the formation of the colour string - fields and hence the application of the conventional lund string hadronisation model results in a different topology of the hadronic final state .",
    "the model gives an essentially correct description of diffractive dis @xmath8 scattering at hera @xcite as well as diffractive events at the tevatron having jets or quarkonia @xcite or gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been applied for predictions , e.g. of diffractive higgs production in double gap processes at lhc @xcite .",
    "the gap survival factor @xmath7 often used in other kinds of models , is not necessary here since the full event simulation accounts for such effects resulting in correct rates for the investigated diffractive processes in @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions .",
    "other models of a similar nature , with different forms of colour exchange , have been developed .",
    "the gal model @xcite for example considers soft colour exchanges between strings with a probability that favours minimization of the strings area in energy - momentum coordinates .",
    "a recent development of such colour string reconnection models makes a more elaborate account for @xmath11 colour statistics @xcite .",
    "a theoretical qcd basis for basic colour exchanges has been proposed in @xcite and , in a more elaborated form , in @xcite .",
    "the basic hard scattering process is treated by conventional perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "its large momentum scale implies that it occurs on a small space - time scale compared to the bound state proton and is thus embedded in the proton .",
    "therefore , the emerging hard - scattered partons propagate through the proton s colour field and may interact with it .",
    "the amplitude for such multiple gluon exchanges is calculated in the eikonal approximation to all orders in perturbation theory resulting in an analytic expression for such a colour screening effect .",
    "the theoretical approach @xcite used here to resum multigluon exchange has similarities with the one in @xcite giving a similar eikonal factor @xmath12 in the amplitude , but there are also differences as will be discussed below .",
    "it is this amplitude that we here develop into a probabilistic model . we implement it for two different monte carlo event generators : lepto for general deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering including first order qcd matrix elements and parton showers based on conventional @xmath13 evolution from the dglap equations @xcite , and as well for cascade @xcite specialised on small-@xmath0 electron - proton scattering based on the off - shell @xmath14 first order matrix element and @xmath2 factorisation with ccfm evolution @xcite and unintegrated gluon density of the proton .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dynamic - rescattering ] we describe the basic process with the colour screening . section [ sec : ddis - via - dcs ] discusses the resulting cross - section for diffractive deep inelastic scattering and its monte carlo implementation .",

    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 plus dglap evolution this phase space is in part taken into account , but the dglap evolution does not resum potentially large @xmath108 .",
    "another aspect of the uneven splitting is that one of the quarks will be very forward in pseudorapidity in the lab frame when @xmath28 is close to the divergence . in this case",
    ", the quark can have a large enough forward momentum @xmath109 to populate the gap region and the event therefore does not contribute to the diffractive cross section as defined in terms of a lrg in spite of having a leading proton .",
    "the divergent behaviour is unphysical and is usually avoided with a cutoff .",
    "still , an inclusion of higher order effects may be important for the cross section and also for the inner structure within the @xmath25 system .",
    "in particular , the energy of the @xmath22 system may be shared by additional gluons and therefore significantly reduce the rapidity range of the final @xmath25-system and therefore can have an influence on the lrg observable .     in comparison with the h1 data @xcite .",

    "the dynamic colour screening model describes the probability of a colour screened interaction , but the additional soft exchanges do not change the kinematics of final state partons .",
    "we know on the other hand that our description in terms of matrix elements plus showering does not cover the full phase space .",
    "especially , the lack of additional gluon radiation from the quark propagator in the matrix element @xmath112 could be the reason why this @xmath22-system extends up to too high rapidity and can hadronize into the gap region .",
    "we therefore keep the gap size @xmath153 as in the data , but shift its starting value from 3.3 in data to 4 .",
    "this modification is irrelevant for our result at @xmath154 , but noticeable at @xmath155 where it causes at most a correction of @xmath156 at small @xmath110 and small @xmath5 , but becomes important at @xmath157 .",
    "we expect @xmath150 to be sensitive to higher order corrections especially close to the soft divergence @xmath94 where partons from the matrix element cause activity in the lrg region .",

    ", the fraction of gluons in the lrg depends more strongly on @xmath34 and weaker on @xmath5 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that gluons arise from the parton shower in contrast to the quarks which are defined by the matrix element .    at the leading order of our computation",
    ", we note that the result is only mildly sensitive to the cuts employed to regulate the @xmath94 divergence .",
    "also , a comparison with massive matrix elements at leading order suggests that typical quark masses lead effectively to the same cuts on the energy sharing variable @xmath28 as used in our results . on the other hand , higher order corrections",
    "could significantly alter the internal event structure , especially in the region of the phase space where it is likely to have a large step @xmath28 between @xmath0 and @xmath103 .",
    "there , an additional final state gluon could modify the extension of the @xmath25 system in rapidity . an improved parton evolution based on ccfm with additional splittings @xmath159 and @xmath160",
    "could therefore in principle improve the description further because the diffractive process at a low scale could be described with a qed matrix element and low @xmath0 resummed parton evolution .",
    "similarly , @xmath150 is also sensitive to the distribution of the transverse momenta and energy splitting in the parton shower .",
    "we have developed the probability for dynamic colour screening in dis in a way that can be used in monte carlo event generators and applied it with cascade and lepto .",
    "the resulting model predicts the diffractive dis cross section based on perturbative qcd matrix elements and standard inclusive parton densities in both collinear and @xmath2-factorisation approaches .",
    "this facilitates practical applications of previously obtained theoretical derivations of the amplitude for colour screening through semi - soft multiple gluon exchanges calculated in the eikonal approximation to all orders in perturbative qcd .",
    "the basic formalism gives a theoretical understanding why the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model has been phenomenologically successful , but goes beyond that model by leading to a colour screening probability that depends on the dynamics of the perturbative qcd parton dynamics .",
    "this dynamical screening probability exhibits a saturated behaviour at small transverse momenta of the emerging parton system as well as colour transparency at large transverse momentum .",
    "the monte carlo model has only two , physically motivated parameters .",
    "their values are obtained by fitting the hera diffractive cross section and found to be of the expected magnitude .",
    "the model successfully describes the data over a large kinematic range , significantly better than with a constant screening probability .",
    "interestingly , a fit of a free - form probability function results in the same shape as in our model , and hence gives support for our account of the basic qcd dynamics of relevance .",
    "it is noteworthy that we have not introduced any diffractive parton distribution functions to describe soft dynamics through unknown functions fitted to data .",
    "this explicitly demonstrates that diffractive and inclusive scattering can be described by the same basic qcd processes when explicit account is taken of color degrees of freedom in gluon exchanges at scales below normal cut - offs of @xmath161 gev of hard , perturbative qcd processes and @xmath162 of the hadronisation phase transition .    in some kinematic regions",
    "there are two very different scales present , namely the invariant mass of the diffractive system @xmath131 and the photon virtuality @xmath5 .",
    "this calls for a resummation of large logarithms @xmath163 , or equivalently @xmath164 . to address this issue ,",
    "we take the cross section in the @xmath2-factorisation approach from off - shell matrix elements and unintegrated gluon densities together with the ccfm evolution which provides a resummation of leading logarithms in @xmath165 .",
    "we show that this significantly improves the description of the diffractive hera data at @xmath166 corresponding to @xmath97 .",
    "nevertheless , there are residual deviations in the region where both @xmath110 and @xmath5 are at their lowest values .",
    "this may be attributed to the extreme region of very small @xmath110 when the quark propagator connected to the virtual photon have a significant phase space available for gluon radiation , which is not accounted for ; neither in the leading order matrix element for @xmath167 nor in the ccfm evolution that does not include the @xmath160 splitting .",
    "the dglap evolution does include this and also shows a slightly better result in this case , but is still not sufficient since here the effects of large @xmath168 is not included .    to conclude and connect to the discussion in the introduction",
    ", our study has shown that the phenomenon of diffractive deep inelastic scattering can be described using a basic qcd - framework .",
    "the hard subprocess is treated in the same way as for non - diffractive events but a colour screening process occurs as a result of multiple gluon exchanges that are resummed to all orders .",
    "significant deviations from data occur in a special kinematic region , where potentially large logarithmic corrections are not yet fully included in available evolution equations for gluon radiation .",
    "still , the overall results show that gluonic colour screening in qcd is a viable approach to understand diffraction .        j.  r.  forshaw and d.  a.  ross , cambridge lect",
