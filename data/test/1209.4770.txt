    ", the temperature appears only in two ways .",
    "first , since the mean energy level only appears in the combination @xmath203 , the temperature provides the energy scale on which variation of the mean level energy changes the pumped charge ( spin ) .",
    "second , the absolute value of the pumped charge and pumped spin are proportional to @xmath204 . therefore , all plots are normalized accordingly .",
    "the dependences of the pumped charge ( spin ) on the other parameters are not affected by temperature .",
    "the tunnel coupling of the two dot orbitals to the left and the right lead is defined by four real tunnel - matrix elements , @xmath0 .",
    "if the tunnel - matrix elements are equal for the coupling to the left and right lead , @xmath205 , then , for symmetry reasons , there will be no pumping transport via variation of the quantum dot s levels . to achieve pumping",
    ", the left - right symmetry needs to be broken by changing either the magnitude or the sign of one the tunnel couplings .",
    "we find it convenient to parametrize the tunnel - matrix elements by angles @xmath206 , which have been introduced in the previous section ( see eq . ) .",
    "the tunnel - matrix elements then are given by the relations @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "for @xmath209 both orbital levels are coupled symmetrically to lead @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath210 , and for @xmath211 the orbitals are coupled antisymmetrically , @xmath212 . the necessary condition to get a finite pumped charge ( spin )",
    "is @xmath213 , since @xmath214 ( even for @xmath215 ) leads automatically to an effective one parameter pumping without any finite pumped charge ( spin ) in the adiabatic limit .      motivated by the previous discussion , we first focus on a tunnel - coupling configuration with @xmath216 but @xmath213 , where the pumped charge and pumped spin are , in general , finite .",

    "for no coulomb interaction , the maximum value is located at @xmath228 ( relative to the chemical potential @xmath1 of the leads ) . in the limit of strong coulomb interaction ,",
    "the extrema positions are shifted to values of @xmath217 , whose order of magnitude is given by the temperature .",
    "the @xmath218-position of the maximum pumped charge ( spin ) depends on the tunnel coupling to the leads and the so - coupling strength .",
    "increasing @xmath145 also increases the maximum s position with respect to @xmath218 .",
    "furthermore , the pumped charge is in general larger for no coulomb interaction  apart from special tunnel - coupling configurations discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "that is not surprising since the coulomb interaction  reduces the possible transport channels through the dot by suppressing occupations of the dot with more than one electron .",
    "both limits @xmath40 and @xmath41 show different symmetries with respect to @xmath229 . in the limit @xmath40 , the pumped charge ( spin )",
    "is exactly antisymmetric in @xmath218 .",
    "the antisymmetry with respect to @xmath230 originates from the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the antisymmetry in @xmath218 alone , on the other hand , is a non - trivial result and only valid for the lowest order contribution in @xmath36 . in the limit of strong coulomb interaction",
    ", the symmetry in @xmath218 differs from the @xmath40 limit .",
    "the exchange field @xmath231 , which interacts with the isospin , leads to a contribution of the pumped charge ( spin ) that is not antisymmetric in @xmath218 .",

    "the pumped spin , on the other hand , is still approximately antisymmetric in @xmath218 .",
    "furthermore , without @xmath231 , the pumped charge ( spin ) is usually smaller for @xmath41 , compared to @xmath40 , because of the reduced number of transport channels through the dot , but the exchange field can enhance the pumped charge .",
    "there are sets of parameters where the charge transport is even larger for finite coulomb interaction  than for @xmath40 .    for tunnel coupling @xmath233 ,",
    "the symmetric part of the exchange - field contribution is less important . the pumped charge , in this case ,",
    "is not dominated by a symmetric behavior as we observed for coupling @xmath232 .",
    "it is , rather , a shift of the point of zero pumped charge to a finite value of @xmath218 similar to the pumped spin .    comparing the exchange - field contribution for configurations @xmath232 and @xmath233 , the contribution to the pumped spin reaches its maximum where the contribution to the pumped charge vanishes , and it is approximately half of its absolute maximum value where the contribution to the pumped charge has its maximum . for large values of exchange - field contribution , near its maximum",
    ", the pumped charge has a dominant symmetric contribution while the exchange - field contribution to the pumped spin is , in general , too small to generate a peak at @xmath240 .",
    "pure spin pumping is achieved whenever the pumped charge vanishes but the pumped spin remains finite . to find such points",
    "it is helpful that the pumped charge and pumped spin behave differently in the presence of coulomb interaction , as discussed in the previous section , and that the pumped charge is more sensitive to symmetry in the tunnel - matrix elements than the pumped spin .",
    "this defines the two strategies to obtain pure spin pumping : to tune either the orbital energy levels of the dot or the tunnel - matrix elements .      for fixed tunnel couplings ,",
    "we try to tune the orbital energies such that the pumped charge vanishes but the pumped spin remains finite . as discussed above , this is easily possible for strong coulomb interaction , because in this case , the value of @xmath218 at which the pumped charge changes its sign is shifted away from @xmath240 due to the exchange field @xmath191 . in absence of coulomb interaction  ( and to lowest order in the tunnel coupling strength ) , this does , in general , not work apart from special coupling configurations , where the pumped charge vanishes independently of the orbital energies , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the reason is that both the pumped charge and the pumped spin are , to lowest order in @xmath36 , exactly antisymmetric in @xmath218 , i.e. , the pumped charge and spin vanish simultaneously .",
    "the comparison between the two limits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : de ] .",
    "the points of pure spin pumping are indicated by the vertical dotted lines .",
    "another interesting feature of the finite difference between the zero - points for the pumped charge and the pumped spin is the possibility to change the sign of the pumped spin , while charge is pumped in the same direction .",
    "there are cases in which pure spin current is not only possible for special , fine - tuned orbital energies but for _ all _ values of @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] , which shows the maximum absolute value of the pumped charge ( spin ) in the @xmath241 parameter space , as a function of the coupling parameters @xmath206 for @xmath234 and for both limits @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the plots can be periodically continued .",
    "the dotted lines represent coupling configurations where the pumped charge and the pumped spin are zero .    along the middle dotted line ,",
    "@xmath242 , pumped charge and pumped spin vanish due to left - right symmetry as mentioned previously . here , the tunnel - matrix elements are equal for the coupling to the left and the right lead , @xmath205 .",
    "the dotted zero - lines @xmath243 for zero pumped charge ( spin ) only exist for lowest order in @xmath36 ; higher - order corrections would lead , in general , to a finite pumped charge ( spin ) .",
    "the latter conclusion can be drawn by comparing with calculations for @xmath40 which are exact in @xmath36 , e.g. , by means of a scattering matrix approach,@xcite and it is self - evident that even finite coulomb interaction  does not change that significantly . along these lines",
    "the tunnel - matrix elements are given by @xmath244 .",
    "in any case , these dotted lines do no mark good candidates for pure spin pumping since , there , charge and spin behave similar .    the situation differs along the dashed lines .",

    "we find ( to lowest order in @xmath36 ) pure spin pumping for both vanishing and strong coulomb interaction .",
    "this generalizes the result found in ref .   for the @xmath40 limit to the limit of strong coulomb interaction .",

    ". it also decreases with increasing @xmath218 . in both cases ,",
    "the pumping is suppressed since the difference of the eigenenergies of the dot hamiltonian becomes large .",
    "in general , the coulomb interaction  reduces the amount of pumped charge and pumped spin . for small values of @xmath145",
    "compared to @xmath36 , however , the coulomb interaction  has the opposite effect on the pumped charge . in this regime , the coulomb interaction  increases the pumped charge compared to the limit of @xmath40 .",
    "the latter is an effect of the exchange field : without the exchange field , the pumped charge would be reduced due to the coulomb interaction . increasing @xmath145 decreases the influence of the exchange field , i.e. , for large @xmath145 the coulomb interaction  again reduces the pumped charge .",
    "for the pumped spin , the situation differs : the exchange field reduces the pumped spin even further .",
    "the pumped spin , in contrast to the pumped charge , vanishes for @xmath255 .",
    "therefore , there is an optimal value of @xmath145 that maximizes the pumped spin ( see fig .",
