    "the stochastic alpha , beta , rho ( sabr ) model introduced by hagan , kumar , lesniewski and woodward in  @xcite is now a key ingredient  and has become an industry standard  on interest rates markets  @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the pair of coupled stochastic differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two correlated brownian motions on a filtered probability space @xmath6 .",
    "its popularity arose from a tractable asymptotic expansion of the implied volatility ( derived in  @xcite ) , and from its ability to capture the observed volatility smile ; calibration therefore being made easier using the aforementioned expansion . in today",
    "s low interest rate and high volatility environment , the implied volatility obtained by this very expansion can however yield a negative density function for the price process  @xmath7 in  , therefore exhibiting arbitrage .",
    "this problem of negative density in low interest - rate environments has been directly addressed by hagan et .",
    "al  @xcite , balland and tran  @xcite , and andreasen and huge  @xcite , who proposed modifications of the original sabr model . there exist several refinements to the asymptotic formula itself : in  @xcite obj fine tunes the leading order , and paulot  @xcite provides a second - order term . in certain parameter regimes the exact density has been derived for the absolutely continuous part ( on  @xmath8 ) of the distribution of  @xmath7 : in the uncorrelated case @xmath9 , formulae were obtained in  @xcite by applying time - change techniques .",
    "the correlated case is much harder , and approximations have been derived using projection methods in  @xcite , and using geometric tools in  @xcite . barring computational costs ,",
    "availability of the distribution of the sabr process is equivalent to computing any european prices .",
    "this however calls for a computation , not only on the continuous part of the distribution ( on @xmath10 ) , but also of its singular part at the origin . absorbing boundary conditions at the origin",
    "ensure ensure that the forward rate process  @xmath7 is a true martingale , and the singular part can hence accumulate mass , depending on the starting value of the process , the parameter configuration and the time horizon .",
    "the original asymptotic formula typically loses accuracy for long - dated derivatives , when the cev exponent  @xmath11 is close to zero , or when the volatility of volatility  @xmath12 is large .",
    "the parameter  @xmath11 governs the dynamics of the smile , and small values thereof are usually chosen when the asymptotic formula fails , namely on markets where the forward rate is close to zero and for long - dated options  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it comes as no surprise that the orginal formula  which is an asymptotic expansion for small values of  @xmath13breaks down for large maturities , but it is well known that the reasons for the inconsistencies of the sabr formula are subtler than that .",
    "what we highlight here is that the mass at zero can be held accountable for the irregularities in this case as well . while standard numerical methods proved reliable",
    "when the process remains strictly positive , computing the probability mass of the sabr model at the origin is a more delicate issue . due to the singularity at the origin , usual regularity assumptions ensuring stability of numerical techniques (",
    "finite differences or monte carlo ) are violated at this point , and a rigorous error analysis for these methods is not ( yet ) available . in addition , producing reference values becomes computationally intensive for short time scales .",
    "since much of the popularity of the sabr model is due to the tractability of its asymptotic formula , one should aim at preserving it while taking into account the mass at zero .",
    "the parameter sets @xmath9 or @xmath14 are the most tractable , and in fact ( as observed in  @xcite ) the only ones where certain advantageous regularity properties of the sabr process can be expected .",
    "we therefore concentrate here on the singular part of the distribution for these regimes , that is , we study the probability @xmath15 and provide tractable formulae and asymptotic approximations .",
    "the relevance of these parameter configurations is emphasized by recent results  @xcite , which suggest a so - called ` mixture ' sabr ( a combination of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 cases ) approach to handle negative interest rates in an arbitrage - free way . from a modelling perspective , one may question the relevance of an absorbing boundary condition at zero in a financial context , where negative rates can actually occur .",
    "in fact , from a stochastic analysis perspective , when @xmath14 there is no need to impose such a boundary condition .",
    "remarkably however , as pointed out in  @xcite , even in market conditions where interest rates become negative , the historical evolution of interest rates suggests that their dynamics follow processes whose probability distribution exhibit a singularity at the origin , which makes the computation of the mass at zero rates relevant for these market scenarios as well .",
    "a further application is a direct approximation of the left wing of the implied volatility smile . in order to understand the small - strike behaviour of the sabr smile",
    "it is essential to determine the probability mass at the origin : asymptotic approximations of the implied volatility are available , not only for small and large maturities , but also for extreme strikes .",
    "roger lee s celebrated moment formula  @xcite  subsequently refined by benaim and friz  @xcite and gulisashvili  @xcite  relates the behaviour of the implied volatility  @xmath16 for small strike  @xmath17 and maturity  @xmath18 to the behaviour of the price process  @xmath7 around the origin . de marco , hillairet and jacquier  @xcite , and",
    "later gulisashvili  @xcite , showed that when the underlying distribution has an atom at zero , the small - strike behaviour of the implied volatility is solely determined by this mass , irrespective of the distribution of the process on @xmath8 .",
    "we shall numerically confirm this in the ( uncorrelated ) sabr model , using approximations of the probability mass , in agreement with  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : masszero ]",
    "we derive explicit formulae for the mass at zero @xmath15 in the sabr model for finite time as well as for large times in the uncorrelated case . under this assumption , it is possible to decompose the distribution into a cev component and an independent stochastic time change .",
    "such time change techniques have been applied to the sabr model in the uncorrelated case in  @xcite to determine the exact distribution of the absolutely continuous part of the distribution on @xmath8 . therefore , our formulae complement these by providing the singular part of the distribution ( see  @xcite for more details about time change techniques in stochastic volatility models ) . in section  [ ss : smalltime ] and",
    "section  [ section : largetimeuncor ] , we derive asymptotic expansions for the density of time - changed brownian motion  inspired by the works of borodin and salminen  @xcite , gerhold  @xcite and matsumoto and yor  @xcite  which we use to derive the behaviour of the atom at the origin for short and large times .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : impliedvolatility ] , we use these results to determine the left wing ( small strikes ) of the sabr implied volatility . using the formulae provided in  @xcite , we highlight the fact that some of the widely used expansions exhibit arbitrage in the left wing , and propose a way to regularise them in this arbitrageable region .",

    ", the resulting process  @xmath27 satisfies the cev stochastic differential equation @xmath28 starting from @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a deterministic time - dependent volatility coefficient , and represents , for fixed  @xmath31 , a realisation of the paths of  @xmath26 .",

    "should one consider the origin to be reflecting , the transition density would then become norm preserving , and no mass at the origin would be present . however , it is easy to see that there is an arbitrage opportunity if the origin is reflecting .",
    "formula   carries over to the case @xmath48 when the origin is assumed to be absorbing , which we shall always consider from now on .",
    "this is of course in line with  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the main challenge is to provide a short - time asymptotic formula for the density of the time change process , for which standard expansion techniques are not applicable .",
    "the additive functional arising from the density of an integral over the exponential of brownian motion often appears in the pricing of asian options and is of interest on its own .",

    "* section 4.6 ) .",
    "these numerical issues are discussed in  @xcite , and gerhold  @xcite used saddlepoint methods to provide short - time estimates . because of the time change and the complexity of the kummer function ( in the integrand ) , small - time asymptotics of the mass at zero can not be estimated directly .",
    "instead , we use an inverse laplace transform approach , inspired by  @xcite , to provide small - time asymptotic estimates for the density of the time change . from   and  , we introduce the notation @xmath60 , and we shall alternate between the two notations without ambiguity in order to simplify some of the formulations below .    for @xmath61 , the function  @xmath55 has the form @xmath62 , for some @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
