    "recently @xcite a semiempirical shell model mass equation ( ssme ) based on proton magic number z = 126 @xcite was shown to have a high predictive power in the interior of major shell regions beyond lead n @xmath1 and with 126 @xmath2 n @xmath2 184 .",

    "we first address the smoothness of the predictions and their overall agreement with @xmath3 systematics .",
    "then we test the agreement of the equation with the data observed in several recent fusion - evaporation she experiments where the produced nuclei are identified by their decay ties to known daughter isotopes .",
    "finally we address the interpretation problem in some recent hot fusion experiments where the observed decay chains do not connect the parent to a known daughter , and several reaction channels are in principle possible .",

    "the trend of isotopic lines between n = n@xmath6 and n = n@xmath6 + 2 is positive , and the vertical distance between isotopic lines with z = z@xmath6 and z = z@xmath6 + 2 for n @xmath9 n@xmath6 is larger than for other z values .",

    "in hot fusion - evaporation she experiments , when the compound nucleus ( cn ) is produced at a sufficiently high excitation energy ( e@xmath18 ) , there are often several conceivable open emission channels for forming the parent , which would lead to different observable @xmath0-decay chains .",
    "when the @xmath0-decay chain starting from the evr parent nucleus does not connect to a known daughter isotope , comparing different predictions to the observed data might facilitate the choice between different conceivable interpretations .",

    "four conceivable evr parents in addition to the assigned parent @xmath21116 are considered in table i. their corresponding formation channels , the estimated values of their excitation energies ( e@xmath27 ) in tables i and ii are obtained from the kinematics of the reactions assuming that the evaporated neutrons have zero kinetic energy and the evaporated charged particles ( @xmath26 and @xmath0 ) have a kinetic energy which is equal to their potential energy at the top of the coulomb barrier .",
    "higher kinetic energies of the evaporated particles would reduce the estimates given in the tables .",

    "for the @xmath29 formation channel assigned by the authors the estimated e@xmath27 value of the parent nucleus @xmath30 is too low ( less than 2 mev ) to have a reasonable production cross section . moreover , the 758 kev @xmath16 value of the predicted @xmath3 values is too large . on the other hand ,",
    "for the @xmath31 channel leading to the evr parent @xmath32 the corresponding estimated e@xmath27 value and the value of @xmath16 are @xmath214 mev and 466 kev which are reasonable .",
    "this might lend support to a scenario based on the @xmath31 ( and possibly also @xmath25 ) channel .",
    "the last two members of the @xmath0-decay chains seen in this experiment agree with the two - members @xmath0-decay chains observed before in a z = 114 experiment @xcite .",
    "if they are the same , a formation of the present z = 116 parent by @xmath31 ( or @xmath25 ) emission would imply the same formation channel for the z = 114 evr parent in ref .",

    "an observed three - members @xmath0-decay chain is considered a good candidate for originating from the parent @xmath34114 and its sequential decay down to @xmath17hs ( z = 108 ) .      for the @xmath25 formation channel assigned by the authors , leading to the evr parent @xmath35 , the respective estimated e@xmath27 value and the @xmath16 value are @xmath29 mev and 905 kev .",
