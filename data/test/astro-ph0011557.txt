    "clusters of galaxies are critical cosmological probes for two fundamental reasons .",
    "first , galaxy clusters are the most massive virialised objects in the universe and reside in the tail of the mass distribution function . thus the distribution , density and properties of clusters are very sensitive to the mean mass density of the universe .",
    "for example , in a low @xmath0 universe , the evolution of the mass function terminates at early epochs , thus `` freezing '' the number of massive systems .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath1 , were the mass function continues to evolve up to the present epoch ( see press & schtecter 1974 ; ps ) . unlike other cluster methods of measuring @xmath0 ( mass - to  light ratios , baryon fractions _ etc _ ) ,",
    "this technique provides a global measure of @xmath0 and is relatively insensitive to @xmath2 ( see romer et al .",
    "2000 ) . for a more complete description of ps and this effect ,",
    "the reader is referred to viana & liddle ( 1999 ) , reichart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) & borgani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and references therein .",
    "many authors have used this technique with a preponderance of the evidence for a low @xmath0 , but the observed scatter between the various measurements is large .",
    "for example , we have seen @xmath3 ( bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath4 ( eke et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath5 ( henry 1997 ) , @xmath6 ( viana & liddle 1999 ) , @xmath7 ( sadat et al .",
    "1998 ) , and @xmath8 ( reichart et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this scatter could be the combination of several effects including small sample sizes , errors in the survey selection functions as well as the necessity to compare local samples of clusters to more distant samples in any effort to see an evolutionary signal .",
    "secondly , each cluster represents a sample of galaxies that has formed at roughly the same time under roughly the same initial conditions .",
    "thus , each cluster is a laboratory for understanding how galaxies form , evolve and interact with their environment .",
    "such phenomena are usually known as the _ morphology - density relation _ and/or the _ butcher  oemler effect_. there are many proposed models to explain these phenomena including ram  pressure stripping , pressure  induced star formation , temperature  inhibited star formation , galaxy harassment , shocks from cluster merger events _ etc .",
    "_ as yet , we do not have a definitive answer but observations of clusters - as a function of the cluster properties - will help to dis  entangle these different possible mechanisms .",
    "it is clear that we need larger , more objective , cluster catalogs to help obtain high precision measurements of @xmath0 as well as determine the physical mechanism(s ) behind galaxy evolution in clusters ( see kron 1993 for a discussion of the role selection effects could play in the butcher  oemler effect ) . to significantly move beyond previous work , any new sample of clusters should possess the following key attributes : _",
    "i ) _ contain many thousands of clusters ; _ ii ) _ possess a well understood selection function ; _ iii ) _ probe a broad range in redshift and mass , and _",
    "iv ) _ possess physically meaningful cluster parameters .",
    "there are several cluster projects under - way that satisfy these criteria ( see , for example , collins et al . 2000 ; romer et al . 2000 ; gladder & yee 2000 ; ebeling et al . 2000 ) including the sdss ",
    "rass cluster ( src ) survey which we discuss below .",
    "the src is a new sample of clusters constructed through the unique union of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; see york et al .",
    "2000 & castander et al .",
    "2000 ) and the rosat all  sky survey ( rass ; see voges et al .",
    "2000 ) . using state  of  the  art cluster  finding methodologies , we plan to construct a sample of @xmath9 clusters and groups that will span a large dynamic range in both redshift and mass as well as possessing a well  understood selection function .",
    "moreover , we will endeavor to measure physically meaningful parameters for these clusters like x  ray and optical luminosities , lensing masses , velocity dispersions _ etc .",
    "_ finally , the src also represents a critical first step in the construction of the `` virtual observatory '' ( vo ) ; for the first time , we plan to perform a joint optical  x - ray cluster selection using these existing , multi  dimensional , data archives .    ) at @xmath10 .",
    "the brightest member of this cluster is @xmath11 and is just below the main sdss spectroscopic galaxy target limit .",
    "however , this galaxy has the correct colors and magnitude to be included in the sdss bright red galaxy ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) sample .",
    "the signal  to  noise of the individual galaxies in this image is reasonably high ( @xmath12 ) thus allowing us to study their characteristics .",
    "[ sharc ] ]    to illustrate the power of combining the sdss and rass , we have constructed a preliminary src catalog which was constructed simply from the cross  correlation of the rass source lists ( both bright and faint source catalogs from voges et al .",
    "2000 ) with a preliminary sdss cluster sample constructed by annis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using the maxbcg algorithm .",
    "we discuss our new method of finding clusters in the sdss  rass in section [ method ]    in figure [ sharc ] , we show an example of a high redshift cluster detected in this preliminary catalog , while in figure [ lf ] , we show a very preliminary determination of the src x  ray cluster luminosity function ( xclf ) ( 21 clusters above @xmath13 in the redshift range @xmath14 ) . here",
    "we have used runs 752 & 756 ( @xmath15 ) and 94 & 125 ( @xmath16 ) from the sdss data ( see york et al",
    ". 2000 ) which we have naively assumed to be complete to a flux limit of @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "this assumption is valid for our luminous clusters but breaks down for lower luminous clusters and undoubtedly accounts for the `` low '' data points in our xclf at @xmath19 .",
    "we have also conservatively cut the catalog at @xmath20 and removed suspicious match ",
    "ups by hand ( see sheldon et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the src does have candidate @xmath21 clusters which will require spectroscopic confirmation ( annis et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we present this data to illustrate the power of the src for detecting real clusters to high redshift ; the combination of these two , large area , catalogs ( sdss and rass ) allows us to push to fainter fluxes ( and thus higher redshift ) than one would be able with either survey on its own . finally , the xclf presented here is fully consistent with other measurements and adds new information regarding the existence of a `` deficit '' of high redshift , high luminosity clusters which has been debated by many authors ( _ e.g. _ reichart et al .",
    "1999 ; nichol et al .",
    "1999 ; gioia et al .",
    "this is because the src covers a large area of sky ( @xmath22 at present ) which is vital for detecting massive , x  ray bright clusters at high redshift ( see ebeling et al .",
    "2000 ) .    ; stars ) .",
    "the shaded region is the local ( @xmath23 ) x - ray luminosity function , plus @xmath24 errors , as measured by de grandi et al ( 1999 ) and ebeling et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the circles are the sharc ( @xmath25 burke et al .",
    "1997 ; nichol et al .",
    "poisson errors are shown .",
    "[ lf ] , height=288 ]",
    "over the last few years , there has been significant progress in the development of new cluster  finding algorithms primarily driven by the quality and quantity of new data as well as the increased availability of fast computing .",
    "these new methods include the matched  filter algorithm ( postman et al .",
    "1996 , kawasaki et al 1998 , kepner et al 1999 , bramel et al . 2000 ) , the wavelet  filter ( slezak et al 1990 ) , the `` photometric redshift '' method ( kodama et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the `` density  morphology '' relationship ( ostrander et al . 1998 ) or the e / s0 ridge  line ( gladders & yee 2000 ) .",
    "here we outline a new algorithm we have developed which exploits the quality and quantity of data available to us . for instance , the sdss will provide accurate , calibrated magnitudes in 5 filters ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) as well as accurate star - galaxy separation , galaxy shapes , photometric redshifts and estimates of the galaxy type .",
    "these increased number of observables allow us to refine our definition of a cluster to be an overdensity of galaxies in both space ( on the sky and in redshift ) and rest  frame color .",
    "furthermore , we can require that the cluster members be early  type galaxies and that the cluster , as a whole , is coincident with extended hard x - ray emission .",
    "the motivation for this definition of a cluster is the growing body of evidence that the cores of clusters are dominated by ellipticals of the same colors suggesting they are coeval ( see gladders & yee 2000 ) , and possess a hot , intracluster medium ( see holden et al .",
    "2000 ) . via this definition",
    ", we can radically increase the signal  to  noise of clusters in this multi  dimensional space thus effectively removing projection effects and x  ray mis  identifications which presently plague optical and x  ray cluster surveys respectively .",
    "we have nicknamed this algorithm `` c4 '' for 4color clustering .",
    "we note that this definition may bias us against certain types of clusters _",
    "e.g. _ young systems where the x  ray gas may be more diffuse ( thus a lower emissivity ) and/or have a bluer , less homogeneous , galaxy population .",
    "however , over the redshift range probed by sdss & rass ( @xmath28 ) , most clusters are expected to be well evolved since they have formation epochs of @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , we will need to quantify our exact selection function regardless of the algorithm used ( see section [ bias ] ) .",
    "we present here a brief overview of the c4 algorithm and then present specific details about parts of the algorithm below .",
    "we start by considering galaxy @xmath30 which is any detected galaxy with a known or photometric redshift .",
    "the fundamental question the c4 cluster - finding algorithm poses is : _ is there an overdensity of cluster - like galaxies about galaxy @xmath30 ? _ our solution for answering this question is rather simple .",
    "first , we count @xmath31 , the number of galaxies in a multi  dimensional aperture around galaxy @xmath30 .",
    "the aperture ( discussed in detail in section [ aperture ] ) is defined in angular , redshift and color space .",
    "second , for each test galaxy @xmath30 , we measure a field distribution , @xmath32 , which is constructed via monte carlo realisations of placing the same size aperture as the test galaxy on thousands of randomly chosen galaxies in regions of similar extinction and seeing as @xmath30 .",
    "third , if galaxy @xmath30 is in a clustered region , then @xmath31 will lie in the tail of the distribution and we can measure a probability , @xmath33 , that galaxy @xmath30 is a member of this field distribution @xmath32 .",
    "we then have to decide what acceptable cut - off in @xmath33 differentiates between cluster galaxies and field galaxies ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "note that c4 does not find clusters but detects cluster  like galaxies .",
    "it is based on a well - defined description of the field , which is easily measured from a large - volume survey such as the sdss .",
    "those galaxies that have a low probability of being a field galaxy are then considered to be cluster members .",
    "finally , we use these cluster  like galaxies to locate the positions of the actual clusters in the data .",
    "values for the 183 galaxies within the aperture of src galaxy rxj0254 ( figure [ sharc ] ) .",
    "inserted is a blow  up of small @xmath34values which illustrates the strong peak near zero _",
    "i.e. _ probability in 6dimensional space that these galaxies were drawn from the field distribution .",
    "this illustrates the strength of clustering one can obtain since 6dimensional space is mostly empty and thus finding any grouping of galaxies on the sky with the same redshift & color is enough to make it highly unlikely that they are drawn from a random field population .",
    "[ fdr1 ] , height=288 ]      a critical part of computing @xmath31  the galaxy count in multi ",
    "dimensions around our test galaxy  is the choice of the size and shape of the counting aperture _",
    "i.e. _ we are using a kernel to smooth the data .",
    "we note here that we focus on defining the width of this kernel or aperture , rather than the shape , since it is well  known in the statistical literature that the choice of bandwidth of a kernel is more important when optimally smoothing data than the exact shape of that kernel .    to discuss this further , suppose that @xmath35 are independent observations from a probability density function @xmath36 .",
    "a common estimator is the kernel estimator defined by @xmath37 the function @xmath38 is called the kernel and is usually assumed to satisfy @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 . for example , the gaussian kernel is @xmath42 .",
    "the number @xmath43 is the bandwidth and controls the amount of smoothing .",
    "one can see from numerical experimentation that the choice of @xmath38 has very little effect on the estimator @xmath44 but the choice of @xmath43 has a drastic effect .",
    "this can also be proved mathematically .",
    "for example , consider the integrated means squared error ( imse ) defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the average or expectation value .",
    "one can derive an analytic expression for imse and from this expression one sees that @xmath38 has little effect on imse but @xmath43 has a drastic effect .",
    "details are given in _ density estimation for statistics and data analysis _ by silverman ( 1986 ) .",
    "in fact , one can show that the optimal kernel , which minimizes imse , is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this is called the epanechnikov kernel .",
    "but the efficiency of other kernels ( the ratio of the imses ) is typically near 1 .",
    "for example , the gaussian kernel has an efficiency of 0.95 compared to an epanechnikov kernel .",
    "in contrast , the effect of @xmath43 is dramatic , so ; how does one find the optimal bandwidth ?",
    "this is clearly difficult and in statistics , it is usually achieved using `` cross - validation '' where one estimates the @xmath49 and finds @xmath43 to minimize this function ( see silverman 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , we simply use a top  hat kernel in the c4 algorithm and use the known observables of the galaxy @xmath30 ( redshift and colors ) , as well as known physical relationships , to define the aperture size or bandwidth .",
    "we start by defining an input mass scale to search for clusters .",
    "this allows us to calculate @xmath50 which is converted to an angular aperture ( @xmath51 ) as function of cosmology . in this conversion ,",
    "we use either the known or photometric redshift ( see connolly et al .",
    "next we define a redshift aperture , @xmath52 , which is based on the expected radial velocity dispersion for a cluster with @xmath50 ( determined analytically ) .",
    "this is also convolved with the error on the observed or photometric @xmath53 .",
    "finally , we use a 4-dimensional color - aperture , @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , where the width of this aperture is simply the measured errors on the sdss photometric magnitudes for galaxy @xmath30 .    once we have defined our aperture , we then simply count the number of neighboring galaxies within this 6dimensional aperture .",
    "we note that all the sdss galaxies will possess errors on the redshift ( photometric and spectroscopic ) and colors , so instead of counting each galaxy as a single delta ",
    "function in our count @xmath31 , we can treat each galaxy as an error ellipsoids in 6dimensional space and compute the amount of overlap between these ellipsoids and the aperture .",
    "this is non - trivial and therefore , we will monte carlo the effect by computing many @xmath31 around each test galaxy @xmath30 perturbing in each case the surrounding galaxies by their observed errors . this will result in a distribution of @xmath31 for each galaxy , @xmath56 .",
    "the counting queries we have outlined above are computationally intensive and thus , to make this problem tractable , we will exploit the emerging algorithmic technology of multi  resolutional kd  trees ( see connolly et al .",
    "2000 ) which can scale as @xmath57 , instead of @xmath58 , for range searches like those discussed herein .",
    "we defer discussion of these computational issues to a forthcoming paper .",
    "having measured @xmath31 , we now need to build the field distribution , @xmath32 .",
    "recall , we want to use the same size aperture as that of galaxy @xmath30 . in order to determine @xmath32 , we will count galaxies around a random distribution of galaxies that lie in regions of similar extinction and seeing to that of galaxy @xmath30 .",
    "as above , these field counts can be corrected for observational errors and thus @xmath32 will be the sum of many count distributions around each randomly selected field galaxy",
    ".     area from sdss photometric data runs 752 & 756 ( rerun 1 ) .",
    "we show all galaxies regardless of redshift , color or magnitude .",
    "( top right ) this is the result of running the c4 algorithm on this data using a 5% fdr threshold .",
    "we rejected 4% of the galaxies on the left as being field  like galaxies .",
    "( bottom ) same area taken from the rass hard photon data ( each dot is at least one photon ) .",
    "the large cluster seen in the field is abell 1882 ( richness class 3 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the axes are ra and dec [ chris ] ]      once we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 for each test galaxy @xmath30 , we can compute the probability , or @xmath34value , that this test galaxy was drawn from the field .",
    "this is achieved by fitting a poisson distribution to the lower end of the @xmath32 distribution ( which must be the field population ) and comparing @xmath31 to that fitted distribution , see figure [ fdr1 ] .    in this process",
    ", we can make two types of errors : ( 1 ) falsely identifying a real field galaxy as cluster - like ( false rejection ) ; ( 2 ) falsely identfiying a real cluster galaxy as field like ( false non - rejection ) .",
    "the next critical decision is to determine the @xmath34-cutoff below which a galaxy is rejected as being field  like .",
    "this threshold could be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for instance , for each test we could apply a @xmath60 confidence requirement and reject any galaxy with @xmath61 .",
    "however , after @xmath62 tests , we would expect to have made as many as 50000 mistakes through false rejections .",
    "this is far too many mistakes which could be reduced by applying a higher confidence requirement _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath63 .",
    "this leads to the traditional approach of permitting _ no _ false rejections with 95% confidence through lowering the @xmath34-cutoff to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of test galaxies .",
    "this is known as the bonferoni method where each individual test is very conservative to allow for _ no _ false rejections .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that a lot of cluster  like galaxies would be mis - classified as field  like ( _ i.e. _ false non - rejections ) since we have enforced a very strict limit on the number of field  like galaxies that are allowed to be mis  classified as cluster  like galaxies .",
    "this is an extreme case where one sacrifices errors in one direction for the control of mis  classification errors in the opposite direction .",
    "if there were no cluster  like galaxies in our test sample of galaxies , then the bonferoni method would be correct , however @xmath66% of all galaxies live in cluster & group environments , so if we using this method we would loose significant sensitivity to detecting these galaxies .    instead of either of the above two thresholding techniques",
    ", we use the newly devised _ false discovery rate _",
    "( fdr ; abramovich et al .",
    "fdr is a new , more adaptive approach which , in the limit of all the galaxies in the test sample being field  like , would be equivalent to the bonferoni method .",
    "however , fdr becomes less conservative , and makes fewer errors in the other direction , as we diverge from this idealized case . in practical terms",
    ", fdr allows us to define in advance a desired false detection rate _",
    "i.e. _ up  front only @xmath67 of the rejected galaxies are in error based on our null hypothesis .",
    "moreover , the fdr procedure is simple :    1 .   for each test galaxy , calculate a @xmath34-value based on the null hypothesis that it is a field galaxy .",
    "sort these according to increasing @xmath34-value .",
    "3 .   rank the @xmath34-values as a function of @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath70 galaxy s @xmath34-value out of @xmath71 total test galaxies .",
    "draw a line with slope ( @xmath72 ) and intercept 0 .",
    "5 .   from the right , determine the _ first crossing _ of the line with the ranked @xmath34-values .",
    "anything with a @xmath34-value smaller than the crossing @xmath34-value is rejected .",
    "7 .   for our cluster  finding algorithm , these rejected galaxies are our cluster  like galaxies , with at most @xmath67 errors based on our null field galaxy hypothesis .",
    "the beauty of fdr is that _ ( a ) _ it is simple , _ ( b ) _ it possesses a rigorous statistical proof , and _",
    "( c ) _ it works for highly correlated data ( in this case the slope becomes @xmath73 ) . in summary , fdr is a new tool in statistics which has the potential to significantly enhance astronomical analyses ; this is the first application of this new statistic in astronomy and demonstrates the power of our `` computational astrostatistics '' collaboration .",
    "other possible applications could be determining the sky threshold values in source detection , point  source extraction in cmb analyses _ etc .",
    "_ we will explore these application in a forthcoming paper .      in figure [ chris ]",
    ", we show the results of running our c4 algorithm , with fdr , on the sdss commissioning photometric data ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the next task is to `` cluster '' these cluster  like galaxies into a sample of unique clusters of galaxies . to do this ,",
    "we employ the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm which is a mixture model of gaussians designed to be highly adaptive and multi  resolutional in nature .",
    "moreover , it is naturally multi  dimensional thus allowing us to feed it three galaxy spatial coordinates ( angular position and redshift ) as well as three x  ray dimensions ( hard photon energy and angular position ) . the rational for jointly clustering the x ",
    "ray and optical data is to drastically increase the signal  to  noise of distant and poor clusters by suppressing projection effects and x  ray mis  identifications .",
    "the details of mixture  model clustering and the em algorithm can be found in connolly et al .",
    "in addition , to using em we plan to investigate adaptive kernel density estimators .",
    "we note here that during the clustering process additional information can be used to `` mark '' or `` up  weight '' galaxies .",
    "for example , sdss data can be used to determine if a galaxy is elliptical  like based on the imaging morphology ( likelihood fits to each galaxy for both a da vaucouleurs and exponential profile ) , photometric spectral classification information of connolly & szalay ( 1999 ) as well as spectral classifications where available ( see castander et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "the most direct method of quantifying the selection function of our sdss cluster catalog is via monte carlo simulations ( see bramel et al .",
    "2000 ; kim et al.2000 ) .",
    "these simulations can then be converted to an effective area , or volume , of the survey as a function of the input cluster parameters ( redshift , luminosity _ etc _ ) .",
    "in addition to simulations , we can obtain information about the selection function of the various sdss cluster catalogs ( annis et al .",
    "2000 ; kim et al .",
    "2000 ) by cross - correlating them against each other and the low redshift sdss galaxy redshift survey .",
    "these different sdss cluster catalogs use different cluster selection criteria since they are explore different science issues and are therefore , complementary .    in summary , we have outline here our new c4 cluster  finding algorithm that exploits the quality and quantity of the multi  dimensional survey data now becoming available",
    ". it also exploits new techniques and algorithms coming out of computer science and statistics .",
    "we plan to jointly `` cluster '' optical and x  ray data to help improve the signal  to  noise of distant and/or poor clusters / groups of galaxies .",
