    "this analysis corroborates the above result that the rm contribution is negligible for sightlines beyond 60 kpc .",
    "we can therefore try and repeat the ks - test including the two sightlines with closer foreground galaxies without mgii absorption ( x symbols ) , and also the four sightlines with two mgii systems ( open squares ) , assuming that only galaxies with @xmath37 50 kpc contribute rm .",

    "we predicted a wavelength @xmath46 dependent effect , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the intrinsic polarisation . since according to fig .",
    "[ fig : obsrm_vs_d ] the observed rm dispersion increases for smaller impact parameter , we expect the degree of polarization to follow a similar pattern .    in order to test the depolarization potentially suffered by our sources",
    ", we use the ratio @xmath2 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the degrees of polarization at 21 and 1.5 cm , from @xcite and @xcite , and from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "since in general the short and long wavelength emission originate from different components of the radio source ( i.e. the compact core and the radio lobes ) , the above ratio is not a `` measure '' of depolarization .",
    "however , due to the wavelength dependence of the depolarization effect , statistically the ratio @xmath2 will be lower the stronger the depolarizing effect along the line of sight .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp_vs_d ] we plot the ratio @xmath2 versus the impact parameters d to the galaxies .",
    "solid / open circles indicate if the quasar redshift is @xmath51 or @xmath52 . due to",
    "the low number of quasar fields for which both @xmath2 and d are available , this plot also includes two sightlines with multiple absorbers , shown as solid squares . for one of them ( pks 1143 - 245 ) one galaxy is at 21 kpc and the other at 84 kpc , so it is likely that only the closer one is contributing .",
    "for the other ( 4c-02.55 ) both galaxies are close in , at 10.6 kpc and 11.8 kpc from the sightline , respectively , so both are likely contributing to the observed rm .    a clear trend is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp_vs_d ] in the left hand panel , whereby the lower the impact parameter , the lower the value of @xmath2 .",
    "a kendall s @xmath53 test shows that for the overall sample , @xmath2 and d are correlated with @xmath54 and a chance probability of @xmath55 . knowing that quasars with @xmath56 are intrinsically more depolarized than those above this redshift @xcite we split the sample according to this redshift .",
    "this effectively separates out two objects with low @xmath2 values at high impact parameters .",
    "repeating now the test for the @xmath57 sample shows that @xmath2 and d are strongly correlated with @xmath58 and a chance probability of only 1.7 @xmath59 . for comparison ,",

    ", a faraday screen can be modeled as a collection of cells of size @xmath61 , the magnetic field coherence length .",
    "the ( rest frame ) rm dispersion of the cells on a faraday screen of depth @xmath62 is then written as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the rm of a single cell .",
    "we can now relate @xmath44 to the ( rest - frame ) rm dispersion characterizing sightlines through a galactic faraday screen , @xmath65 , by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of surface cells covering the inhomogeneous screen and @xmath45 its covering factor . using the value of @xmath65 estimated at the end of last section , we see that the decrease in @xmath2 towards lower impact parameters can be explained by the observed increase in @xmath0 alone ( figure [ fig : obsrm_vs_d ] ) for @xmath68 a few . in general , however , the coherence scale of the rm , i.e. n , and @xmath69 might also change as a function of @xmath70 .    , as a function of the intervening galaxies impact parameter .",

    "the simultaneous increase towards small impact parameters of the rm dispersion on the one hand , and depolarizing effects as probed by @xmath2 , on the other , is consistent with and coroborates previous results  @xcite suggesting the presence of significant magnetic fields in and around galaxies at distances of several tens of kpc , acting as inhomogeneous faraday screens  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the observed rm can be attributed to magnetic fields either in the disk or in the halo of the intervening galaxies .",
    "the rm associated with the disk magnetic field can be probed using a simple axissymmetric spiral magnetic field model and a distribution of free electrons , @xmath74 , both with radial scalelength and vertical exponential scaleheight of 30kpc and 1.8kpc , respectively  @xcite , and with normalizations , @xmath75 g , @xmath76 , at the galactic center . a simple monte - carlo model for the rm from a sample of galaxies at random orientation along the line of sight",
    ", then shows that a pure disk magnetic field is not able to account for the observed @xmath77 vs d reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsrm_vs_d ] , unless the normalizations or the vertical / radial scales are made unrealistically large .",
    "this implies that , while the disk magnetic field may contribute to the observed rm , other components are most likely present .",
    "it is now established that galactic winds appear in galaxies with star formation rates at low @xcite , intermediate @xcite and high redshifts @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that mgii absorption in foreground edge - on galaxies at @xmath78 shows a strong azimuthal dependence within 50 kpc , indicating the presence of bipolar outflows around the disk rotation axis .",
    "@xcite shows that most mgii quasar absorption systems also lie within @xmath79 of the minor axis and at @xmath80 .    since our mgii systems show statistically the same properties , the sightlines in our sample will pass through regions above the poles ( this will be soon tested with hst imaging of most of the quasar fields in our sample ) .",
    "further magnetized outflows , although at significantly smaller distances of a few kpc , have also been detected in local galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the high rm values in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsrm_vs_d ] are associated with magnetized outflows .",
    "can we get meaningful column densities of free electron @xmath81 in the outflows ? to calculate @xmath81 we use a simple wind model based on the work of  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the outflow rate is proportional to the sfr , @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , for a biconical geometry and constant outflow velocity @xmath83 , @xmath84 with @xmath85 the gas column density measured at impact parameter d from a sightline transverse to the outflow , @xmath86 the opening angle and @xmath3 the mean atomic weight  @xcite . for a fully ionized gas , we can then estimate the free electron column density as , @xmath87 which is essentially the same as the obtained estimate in @xcite for typical mgii systems , based on hi measurements and an estimate of the ionization correction .",
    "this shows that the column density at large d can be substantial in outflows of normal galaxies . using eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmarm ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : rmrelation ] we then infer a magnetic field strength @xmath88 where we have set the number of independent rm cells to @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the projected linear size of the source at @xmath22 and have assumed that the scale of the rm fluctuation , @xmath91 , is the same along the sightline and in the plane of the sky . this value of @xmath92 is higher than the @xmath93 g obtained in @xcite because here we consider that the rm screens are inhomogeneous .",
    "this simple analysis shows that magnetized winds can account for the observed @xmath77 at large impact parameter reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsrm_vs_d ] .",
    "this requires a magnetic field strength @xmath92 of several tens of @xmath3 g , which is considerably larger than the few @xmath3 g fields observed in large scale outflows in nearby galaxies , e.g. ngc5775 @xcite , ngc4666 @xcite .",
    "however , fields of such strength are required in high redshift galaxies by the lack of evolution in the fir - radio correlation  @xcite . in fact",
    ", the radio emitting electrons would otherwise mostly radiate their energy through inverse compton scattering on the cmb and/or starlight , both significantly higher at @xmath94 due to cosmological expansion and a @xmath95 higher sfr , respectively .",
    "since this is not observed , the total magnetic field must have been larger by @xmath96\\sim 4 $ ] .",
    "if this was the case for both large and small scale fields , then values of order of a few tens of @xmath3 g are found for @xmath94 galaxies , if our reference low - z field is the galactic one at several @xmath3 g .",
    "the existence of magnetized outflows in normal galaxies has important implications for @xmath4-@xmath5 models of galactic dynamos .",
    "galactic dynamos are thought to be responsible for the origin of large scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , their efficiency can be severely limited by conservation of magnetic helicity once the small scale magnetic field reaches equipartition with the small scale kinetic energy of interstellar gas  @xcite .",
    "however , galactic winds can transport magnetic helicity away from the plane of the galaxy and restore the efficiency of @xmath4-@xmath5 dynamos , as proposed by  @xcite .",
    "assuming again coexistence of large and small scale fields , our observations support the occurrence of this process and could represent a first observational link between galactic dynamos and magnetized winds at intermediate redshifts .    understanding the nature of magnetic fields in and around intermediate redshift galaxies deserves further work .",
