    "mesoscopic electronic applications typically rely on phenomena which show best when the electrons in small wires are cooled to very low temperatures , ideally to the range of 10 mk . in this regime",
    "the crystal lattice is very weakly coupled to the electron system , and electron cooling via the lattice becomes difficult .",
    "an alternative approach is then to directly cool the electrons .",
    "this can be achieved by placing superconducting ( s ) contacts via insulating ( i ) barriers to the normal - metal ( n ) or superconducting ( s@xmath0 ) wire whose electrons are to be cooled @xcite . by applying a voltage over such sinis / sis@xmath0is coolers",
    ", it has been shown that one can cool electrons well below 100 mk with these structures@xcite , even when the lattice remains at a few hundred mk , or to enhance the superconductivity in the middle s@xmath0 island @xcite .",
    "optimally , such cooling should take the electron temperature to a few mk , a limit which is hardly reached in mesoscopic systems via other known means .    with this type of nonequilibrium cooling , the concept of the electron temperature is not always well defined @xcite , but one has to rather describe the full electron energy distribution function @xcite . in this case cooling corresponds to the sharpening of this distribution function , essentially removing the high - energy excitations .",
    "one of the features limiting the performance of such sinis coolers is the fact that the poor heat conductivity of the superconductors makes them inefficient reservoirs @xcite .",
    "an additional pair of normal - metal electrodes attached to superconducting electrodes of a sinis cooler can improve the relaxation and enhance the cooling characteristics of the device @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the effects of extra n electrodes of this type attached to a generic sinis structure .",
    "the superconducting pieces are now assumed small enough so that they can be driven out of equilibrium by applying a bias voltage between the two normal electrodes .",
    "it is this arrangement of a nisin@xmath0isin multiple heterostructure which is the subject of the present study .",
    "its novel feature as compared to the traditional sinis structure with bulk s electrodes is that nonequilibrium is now induced in all inner islands of the structure , which , in turn , strongly enhances nonequilibrium effects both in the central n and in the adjacent s islands .",
    "the resulting distributions in each island can be inspected by transverse probe tunnel junctions@xcite .",
    "the microscopic nonequilibrium theory of double - barrier sinis junctions is based on time - dependent keldysh green function formalism ( see ref .   and references therein ) . in the present paper",
    "we extend the theory such that nonequilibrium distributions in superconducting islands are also allowed .",
    "the major modification is that the chemical potentials of the two superconducting islands can not be chosen zero simultaneously since these islands have different potentials determined by the bias voltage .",
    "this is equivalent to a time dependence of the order parameters imposed by different time - dependent order - parameter phases . we restrict ourselves to a tunneling hamiltonian approximation which effectively makes the problem spatially independent within each superconducting or normal island",
    "the system we study is shown in fig .",

    "in addition , one has to assume that the intrinsic normal - state resistance @xmath4 of each island is much smaller than any of the tunnel resistances @xmath5 to satisfy the condition that the potential variation inside each region is smaller than its drop across the tunnel barrier .    .",

    "this suggests that the cooling performance of an nisinisin structure can not be improved essentially by an extra tunnel junction as compared to that of a simple sinis structure .",
    "however , the presence of the quasiparticle traps helps to practically realize the superconducting reservoirs by thermalizing them quickly to an object with a high thermal conductance .",
