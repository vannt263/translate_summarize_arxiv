    "the study of antiprotonic atoms and low energy scattering serves a triple purpose :    \\(a ) _ to check some properties of _",
    "@xmath0 _ nucleon interactions _",
    "\\(b ) _ to learn about the structure of the nuclear surface _",
    "\\(c ) _ to find some exotic phenomena as @xmath0 - nucleus quasi - bound states_.    ( a ) . in practice",
    "this possibility is limited to two simple systems : nucleon and deuterium , nevertheless we argue below that heavier atoms also offer some advantages if there exists a subthreshold @xmath1 resonance .",
    "several methods have been used for this purpose , each of them gives information in regions roughly 1 - 4 fm beyond the half - density radius .",
    "one method studies the x - ray cascade and extracts the atomic level shifts and widths . until now",
    ", the information obtained in this way has been limited to at most one level shift @xmath2 and two level widths @xmath3 for a given atom @xcite .",
    "the recent cern experiment @xcite detects more transitions , improves the precision , resolves the fine structure and allows for several shifts and widths per atom . in some deformed nuclei",
    ", this knowledge may be further extended by e2 excitations .",
    "other methods to test the nuclear surface with antiprotons detect the products of @xmath0 annihilation by the nucleus .",
    "the first experiment of this type detected charged mesons and in this way could approximately discriminate the captures on protons from captures on neutrons @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent cern experiments detect residual nuclei of very low nuclear excitation @xcite .",
    "radiochemistry allows to find `` cold '' nuclei of only one nucleon lost in @xmath4 and @xmath5 annihilations .",
    "in this way one can study the ratio of @xmath6 densities .",
    "the surface nature of the nuclear capture processes arises from the high orbital quantum numbers of the annihilating @xmath0 and consequently the radiochemical method selects the most peripheral proton or neutron orbits . on average",
    "there are five mesons emitted in the annihilation and to leave the final nucleus cold they must all avoid collision with it .",
    "this can be achieved only if the annihilation takes place at the extreme nuclear surface around a region 2.5 fm beyond the half density radius .",
    "the advantage of the x - ray studies is that the atomic states in question are known . in the annihilation - product studies this is",
    "not the case , and additional knowledge of capture states and final - state interactions is necessary .",
    "these two types of atomic experiments complement each other .",
    "atomic antiprotons scatter on surface localized nucleons in an almost quasi - free way . however , in the c.m .",
    "system of @xmath7 pairs the energy momentum relation is not the free one .",
    "the energy is determined by the nucleon and antiproton binding @xmath8 , while momenta are described by corresponding wave functions .",
    "thus one needs to extrapolate the scattering amplitudes off the energy shell .",
    "this may generate tremendous effects in cases of quasi - bound states or resonances in the @xmath7 system .",
    "the on shell scattering amplitude at low energies may be parameterized in terms of scattering lengths @xmath9 and scattering volumes @xmath10 as @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 is the c.m .",
    "momentum related to the energy e. many spin and isospin states contribute to the scattering and the detailed structure is uncertain and model dependent .",
    "hence , for the few - body and nuclear physics of antiprotons it is convenient to parameterize the data in terms of an averaged effective complex length @xmath13 defined as    @xmath14    the average is to be performed over atomic and nuclear wave functions . those generate distributions of the total and c.m momenta of the pair .",
    "the total momentum determines recoil energy of the pair with respect to the rest of the nucleus @xmath15 .",
    "the relative momentum determines the strength of p - wave interactions .",
    "the latter are generated by the derivatives @xmath16 over relative @xmath7 coordinates .",
    "such effective scattering lengths have been commonly used to parameterize the optical potential @xmath17 early atomic experiments determined @xmath13 close to @xmath18 fm @xcite .",
    "the depth of this potential well is @xmath19 mev but it has to be stressed that formula ( [ i2 ] ) refers only to the nuclear surface . the extrapolation to densities exceeding some 15@xmath20 of the central density is not justified .    in principle @xmath13",
    "is a function of energy as it depends on the nucleon binding energies .",
    "for example in the simplest nuclei p , d , @xmath21he and @xmath22he the nucleon separation energies are roughly : 0,2,7 and 21 mev respectively .",
    "in addition the recoil energies amount to several mev .",
    "thus , @xmath0 atoms built with these nuclei may test the @xmath7 scattering amplitudes below the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "typical @xmath23 energies involved in equation ( [ i1 ] ) are 0 , -9,-15 and -30 mev .",
    "this region covers most of the energy range required in heavy @xmath0 atoms .",
    "now we attempt an extraction of the length parameters @xmath13 from the recent atomic @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and scattering @xcite experiments .",
    "the next task is to disentangle relation ( [ i1 ] ) to obtain more fundamental scattering parameters @xmath24 at and below the threshold .",
    "the results are collected in table 1 .",
    ".the @xmath7 scattering parameters extracted from few body systems , @xmath25 in [ fm ] , @xmath10 in [ fm@xmath21 ] sources refer to atomic or scattering experiments ( a , s ) and calculations ( c ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "nuclear physics predicts the neutron / proton density ratios to increase at large distances .",
    "this happens predominantly as a result of the coulomb barrier , subject to differences in the separation energies and centrifugal barriers .",
    "such a behaviour is borne out by the three complementary measurements : the lower level width , the upper level width and the single nucleon capture .",
    "these test more and more extreme surface regions . consistency of the two experiments is indicated in the upper five lines , several additional cases exist in the data .",
    "the errors attributed to the atomic values are statistical only .",
    "in addition there exists sizable uncertainty due to the calculation of @xmath27 .",
    "these make a smooth behaviour of the @xmath28 ratios to be an additional , strong constraint on the nuclear densities and the structure of optical potentials .",
    "the two lowest lines of table 2 indicate a strong disagreement between the two experiments . again",
    "the interesting point is that these results are characterized by low proton separation energies of 7.35 mev in @xmath29cd and 7.54 mev in @xmath30sn . in the upper sector of the table",
    "the proton separation energies are close to or larger then 10 mev .",
    "several new results suggest an interesting physics likely to happen in the antiproton interactions on loosely bound protons .",
    "these are : anomalies in the relative neutron / proton single nucleon capture ratios , attractive lower shifts in @xmath29cd , @xmath30sn , the enhancement of @xmath5 absorption for negative but close to threshold energies and the difference between scattering volumes obtained from the protonium and from the deuteronium .",
    "all these , indicate that a particular role in the interaction may be played by the @xmath31 wave .",
    "this state , of vacuum quantum numbers , is characterised by very strong tensor forces generated by the pion exchange .",
    "if the annihilation in the spin triplet states is weak these forces generate a fairly narrow resonance just above the threshold and a quasi - bound state well below it . to understand the effects discussed here both these states seem to be required .",
    "however , there exists a difficulty in this interpretation and in the related experimental search .",
    "such a resonant state has a large radius of 1 - 2 fm .",
    "it can not be built in nuclear systems .",
    "one has to search for it in very low density situations .",
    "those are met , for instance , in the single nucleon @xmath5 captures or in the antiprotonic hydrogen . in the latter case , the effect of @xmath31 state is seen in the fine structure of the 2p states @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a large scattering volume in this state has been confirmed in this way .",
    "unfortunately the latter is almost independent of the annihilation models . to understand the @xmath31 resonance better , a few mev step below the threshold is required .",
    "this may be realised in terms of nuclear experiments .",
    "the relation to other recently found , resonant - like phenomena is not transparent as yet .",
    "the dip found in the @xmath32 annihilation just below the @xmath5 threshold @xcite , might be attributed to the @xmath33 wave .",
    "this effect is at least consistent with the trend of the s wave absorption found in deuteronium and protonium .",
    "another recent finding of a destructive interference in the @xmath34 scattering just above the threshold @xcite may be attributed to an effect of the @xmath35 wave .",
    "an extrapolation of this effect to the subthreshold region is uncertain , at this moment .    to elucidate these questions",
    ", new experiments would be useful : the elastic @xmath36 scattering at few mev energies , resolution of the ls splitting in upper atomic levels and studies of hadronic atoms built on nuclei with very loosely bound nucleons .",
