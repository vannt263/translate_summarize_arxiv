    "hybrid systems ( hs ) are heterogeneous dynamic systems whose behaviour is determined by interacting continuous - variable and discrete - event dynamics , and they arise from the use of finite - state logic to govern continuous physical processes or from topological and networks constraints interacting with continuous control @xcite . it is worth mentioning that , among them , we focuses on two kinds of hs in this work : switching and reset control systems .",
    "switching systems , a class of hs consisting of several subsystems and a switching rule indicating the active subsystem at each instant of time , have been the subject of interest for the past decades , for their wide application areas . likewise ,",
    "reset control systems are standard control systems endowed with a reset mechanism , i.e. , a strategy that resets to zero the controller state ( or part of it ) when some condition holds .",
    "the hybrid behaviour comes from the instantaneous jump due to resets of whole or part of system states @xcite .",
    "many real dynamic systems are better characterized using a fractional - order dynamic model based on differentiation and integration of non - integer - order .",
    "the concept of fractional calculus has tremendous potential to change the way we see , model , and control the nature around us .",
    "denying fractional derivatives is like saying that zero , fractional , or irrational numbers do not exist . from the control engineering point of view , improving and developing the control is the major concern ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    recently , the wide applicability of both hs and systems with fractional - order dynamics has inspired a great deal of research and interest in both fields .",
    "unfortunately , in general there are many difficulties in mixing different mathematical domains .",
    "the case of combining the theories of such systems is no exception .",
    "given this motivation , this paper arises from the idea of coupling two different distinct branches of research , fractional calculus and hs , into a synergistic way , which is believed to give additional flexibility and help the system designer , taking advantage of the potentialities of both worlds . to this respect ,",
    "a mathematical framework of fractional - order hybrid systems ( fhs ) , including modeling , stability analysis , control and simulation , is required to be developed .",
    "accordingly , part ii of these two companion papers deals with fractional - order hybrid control . in particular",
    ", two types of such techniques are reviewed , robust control of switching systems and different reset control strategies , and analysed using the theory developed for fhs in part i @xcite .",
    "experimental and simulated examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies .",
    "the remainder of part ii of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  [ robust ] and [ adrsc ] deal with robust control for switching systems and fractional - order reset control , respectively , as particular cases of fractional - order hybrid control systems .",
    "some simulation and experimental applications are given in each section .",
    "concluding remarks are included in section  [ conch2 ] .",
    "this section addresses the main issues involved in a frequency - domain design method for switching systems for both integer- or fractional - order controllers , taking into account specifications regarding performance and robustness and ensuring the stability of the controlled system .",
    "the velocity control of a vehicle given two design specifications is shown as an example of application .",
    "the full description of this control technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "a scheme of the strategy is shown in fig .",
    "[ robustpi ] for a general system with subsystems @xmath0 , with @xmath1 subsystems .",
    "specifications related to phase margin , gain crossover frequency and output disturbance rejection are going to be considered in this design method .",
    "indeed , other kinds of specifications can be met , depending on the particular requirements of the application .",
    "it should be noticed that , apart from these design specifications , which can change with the application , the stability conditions have to be also fulfilled .",
    "actually , if the number of subsystems which constitutes the system to be controlled is @xmath2 , there are @xmath3 stability conditions to be fulfilled .",
    "therefore , denoting the number of specifications as @xmath4 , a controller with @xmath5 parameters is required in order to fulfil all given specifications and the stability conditions .",
    "consider @xmath6 as the subsystem with the worst conditions for each specification and assume that the phase margin and gain crossover frequency of such a subsystem are denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . also consider that @xmath9 , @xmath1 , are the characteristic polynomials of each closed - loop subsystem and @xmath10 is the controller to be tuned .",
    "thus , the design problem can be formulated as follows :    1 .",
    "frequency domain specifications : 1 .",
    "phase margin : @xmath11 2 .",
    "gain crossover frequency : @xmath12 3 .",
    "output disturbance rejection : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the desired value of the sensitivity function @xmath15 for frequencies less than @xmath16 .",
    "stability conditions : @xmath17    it is important to remark that ( [ spe1])-([spe3 ] ) refer to the worst conditions concerning phase margin , crossover frequency and sensitivity for a subsystem @xmath6 among all subsystems .",
    "the same can be done for any other specification , such as , high frequency noise rejection , steady - state error cancellation , etc .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite for more tuning specifications ) .",
    "the set of conditions ( [ rl ] ) ensures the quadratic stability of the switching system . in the case of the fractional - order systems or time delayed systems , an approximation of fractional - order derivative or delay",
    "can be used to apply these specifications .    as an example , in the case of @xmath18 , a list of types of switching systems and their possible controllers is given in table  [ multip ] any other type of controller can be tuned using the same idea . as can be stated",
    ", the use of fractional - order controllers may have the advantage of allowing more specifications or subsystems to be fulfilled or controlled , respectively , and , consequently , more robust performances to be attained .",
    ".type of switching system and possible controllers when @xmath18 [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) , scaledwidth=40.0% ]     for second - order system ( [ sysimp]),scaledwidth=40.0% ]    ) , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    reset control for a velocity servomotor    this example is to compare fractional- and integer - order reset strategies for the velocity control of a servomotor by _",
    "( see its description in @xcite ) , whose dynamic model is given by : @xmath19 refer to @xcite for more details of this application example .",
    "three base controllers , of integer- and fractional - order , i.e. , a pi , a pid and a fractional - order pi ( fpi ) , were tuned considering the following specifications related to phase margin @xmath20 and gain crossover frequency @xmath21 : @xmath22 at @xmath23 rad / s ( see their parameters in table  [ tabres ] ) . unfortunately",
    ", these base controllers can make the controlled system fast but very underdamped , so reset controllers are required to reduce overshoot and increase phase margin ( e.g. refer to @xcite ) .",
    "thus , replacing traditional integrators in the base controllers by ci or fci , the following reset controllers were also obtained : a proportional ci ( pci ) , a proportional clegg integro - differentiator ( pcid ) and a fpci .",
    "it should be remarked that up to three design specifications can be fulfilled with the fpci there exists one more degree of freedom due to its order @xmath24 .",
    "since only two specifications have to be fulfilled , the performance of the system was analyzed for different values of @xmath24 for the fpci i.e .",
    ", @xmath25 with steps of @xmath26 , causing the following features on the system response : the higher the value of @xmath24 , the faster response and , on the contrary , the lower the value of @xmath24 , the less chance of limit cycle occurrence . taking into account both issues , an intermediate value of @xmath24 was chosen for the fpci for this application : @xmath27 .",
    "[ c]l|c|c|c|c & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath24 + pi & 1.6 & 18.5 & - & - + pid & 1.528 & 23.16 & 0.152 & - + fpi & 0.067 & 13.4 & - & 0.75 +    the results obtained applying the base controllers are shown in fig .",
    "[ pracservo1 ] , where solid , dotted and dash - dotted lines refer to pi , pid and fpi , respectively . from this figure",
    ", it can be stated that : ( i ) the experimental results are similar to the simulated ones ; ( ii ) all responses are stable but have a undesirable value of overshoot .",
    "figure  [ pracservo2 ] shows the simulation and experimental results corresponding to the pci , pcid and fpci solid , dotted and dash - dotted lines , respectively .",
    "as observed , simulation and experimental results are quite similar , as shown with the previous controllers .",
    "moreover , the overshoot is reduced for all cases .",
    "it can be also seen that both the simulated and the experimental responses using pci and pcid cause the occurrence of limit cycle . on the contrary",
    ", one can see that there is no such problem when applying the fpci .",
    "part ii of this paper was studied different fractional - order strategies involved in the control of hybrid systems ( hs ) . in particular ,",
    "two types of such techniques were reviewed , robust control of switching systems and reset control .",
    "experimental and simulated examples were given to demonstrate their effectiveness .",
    "since there is no a general agreement of the interpretation of state space representation of fractional - order systems , mainly concerning initial values ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , a further study should be carried out for fractional - order reset control taking into account this issue in future work .",
