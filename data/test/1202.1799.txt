    "the formation mechanism of the thick disk is one of the most noticeable grey points of our current understanding of the galactic formation and evolution process .",
    "this uncertainty is particularly unfortunate because , being the thick disk a ubiquitous feature among spiral galaxies @xcite , its formation must be a common stage in the early evolution of late - type galaxies . during the nearly three decades since its discovery @xcite ,",
    "many models have been proposed .",
    "the merging scenario , in which the early merging of a small satellite galaxy heats a primordial galactic disk producing an old , thick , and kinematically hot disk population @xcite , has been the most favored model in the last decade , following the evidence that the thin and thick disks are chemically distinct @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even this scenario is not free of problems ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and alternative models have recently been drawn to attention ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that the general properties of the galactic thick disk , such as its mean metallicity or mean kinematics , are not enough to distinguish between the models proposed for its formation .",
    "moreover , the merging scenario has many free parameters , such as the mass of the merging satellite and the inclination of its orbit with respect to the galactic disk , and the observations must constrain them if the quality of the model is to be finally assessed . in the last few years",
    ", theoretical simulations have started to cast predictions of the stellar distribution of stars in the multi - dimensional spatial - kinematical - chemical space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that , within the merging scenario , the time of impact , and the mass and orbit of the infalling satellite can be deduced from the distribution of the expected kinematical clumps in the @xmath7@xmath8 plane , while @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find that the @xmath4/@xmath5 ratio and its variation with galactocentric distance are excellent indicators of the inclination angle of the merging event . @xcite and @xcite have also shown that the observed decrease of rotation velocity with distance from the plane points to a low - latitude merging .",
    "at the same time , the observations are gathering information about the spatial variations of the chemical composition and velocity distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "detailed results of this kind are strongly needed because , through comparison with the expectations from the different models , they can be key to solve the puzzle of the galactic thick disk formation .",
    "we are undertaking an extensive survey aimed to reveal the kinematical and chemical vertical structure of the galactic thick disk @xcite .",
    "preliminary kinematical results were presented by @xcite and @xcite , while the sample was also used to investigate the galactic dark disk @xcite , and lithium - rich stars in the galactic thick disk @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the kinematical results , studying the trend of kinematical quantities as a function of distance from the galactic plane . in later papers of this series , the collected spectra will be used to measure the metallicity and chemical abundances of the sample , to study the variation of the thick disk chemistry with galactic height .",
    "our investigation is based on the sample of @xmath61200 red giants defined by @xcite , vertically distributed with respect to the galactic plane in a cone of fifteen degrees radius centered on the south galactic pole .",
    "the sample covers a large range of galactic heights , from the plane to @xmath95  kpc , and it is volume - complete up to @xmath10=3  kpc .",
    "all the objects have 2mass photometry @xcite , and absolute proper motions from the spm3 catalog @xcite .",
    "the sample was defined by the color cut 0.7@xmath111.1 , to isolate intermediate - metallicity stars .",
    "main sequence ( ms ) dwarfs were excluded both by a sloped cut at fainter magnitudes , parallel to the ms , which excludes all but the nearest ( d@xmath1263  pc ) dwarfs , and by conservative kinematical criteria imposing a stellar velocity lower than the local escape velocity ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",

    "all the stars in the brighter half of the sample were spectroscopically observed , while the completeness decreases with magnitude for fainter objects .",
    "we found a high contamination ( @xmath635% ) by nearby dwarf in the faintest end of the distribution , hence stars with @xmath13 were given lower priority after the first observations .",
    "the distribution of proper motions and colors of the observed sub - sample is shown in figure  [ f_sample ] .",
    "the comparison with the complete sample reveals that no selection effect was introduced : the slight overabundance of red stars in the observed sample is due to the higher completeness at brighter magnitudes , where stars are on average redder .    as discussed later",
    ", we will restrict our investigation to stars with galactic height @xmath141.3  kpc , to avoid a strong thin disk contamination .",
    "this reduced the sample under study to 514 stars .",
    "we visually inspected all the spectra , identifying 46 probable dwarf stars .",
    "as expected , they show on average low radial velocities but high u and v components , and only one is found at @xmath159 .",
    "we also found 22 stars with [ fe / h]@xmath161.5 , as deduced from comparisons with synthetic spectra .",
    "they were considered probable halo contaminants and were excluded from further analysis .",
    "we note that the metal - poor tail of the thick disk extends to much lower metallicities @xcite , but below this limit thick disk stars are outnumbered by halo members by a factor of nearly ten @xcite . finally , we also excluded from analysis 34 stars that , in the galactic cylindrical coordinate system , had velocity components ( defined in section  [ s_disp ] ) outside the range @xmath17u@xmath18300  km s@xmath3 , @xmath19v@xmath12300  km s@xmath3 , and @xmath17w@xmath18150  km s@xmath3 .",
    "the cut in @xmath20 was aimed to remove the residual halo contamination , while the other components were restricted to exclude stars with wrong distance or bad proper motion .",
    "the cut in @xmath8 was offset toward negative values to take into account the vertical shear ( see section  [ s_resmean ] ) .",
    "our final sample thus comprised 412 stars .",
    "the interstellar reddening e(@xmath21 ) was derived for each target from the @xcite maps , and the @xmath22 magnitude and ( @xmath23 ) color were de - reddened by means of the transformations of @xcite .",
    "the distance to each star was then estimated through a color - absolute magnitude relation calibrated on 47tucanae , a disk globular cluster @xcite whose stellar population is very similar to the galactic thick disk both in age and metallicity @xcite . the fit of the cluster red giant branch yields the relation ( l. miller 2008 , priv .",
    "comm . ) : @xmath24 which were translated into absolute magnitude and de - reddened color assuming @xmath25=13.50@xmath260.08 and e(@xmath21)=0.024@xmath260.004 for the cluster distance modulus and reddening , respectively @xcite .    inspecting the 2mass photometric data of 47tuc",
    "used to derive equation  ( [ eq_dist ] ) , we found that the uncertainty on @xmath27 is of the order of @xmath60.2 magnitudes .",
    "this is only a marginal contribution to the final error in distance , because the main source of uncertainty is the relatively wide range of age and metallicity covered by thick disk stars .",
    "indeed , the 2mass photometric errors have only negligible impact , because they do not exceed 0.03  magnitudes for our fainter targets ( @xmath2810.6 ) .",
    "we estimated the effect of the age and metallicity distribution on the derived absolute magnitudes by means of yale - yonsei isochrones @xcite .",
    "we assumed a scatter of 0.3  dex in metallicity , that should include the bulk of thick disk stars @xcite when excluding the scarcely - populated low- and high- metallicity tails @xcite , and a scatter of 2  gyr in age @xcite .",
    "they were considered uncorrelated , because the age - metallicity relation for the thick disk is very weak @xcite .",
    "we finally estimated the error on distance to be @xmath620% , quadratically summing all the relevant contributions .",
    "thin disk stars do not follow the age and metallicity distribution assumed to derive equation  ( [ eq_dist ] ) , and their distances should be systematically biased . indeed , younger , more metal - rich red giants are intrinsically fainter than our estimate . comparing the absolute magnitudes",
    "calculated from equation  ( [ eq_dist ] ) with yale - yonsei isochrones between 2 and 8  gyr , and metallicity following the age - metallicity relation of @xcite and @xcite , we found that the distance of thin disk stars would be overestimated by 1020% .",
    "this systematic error is small , but it has a relevant consequence on the contamination of the sample , which is artificially stretched to larger heights from the plane .",
    "our sample is contaminated by the thin disk , because the targets were selected through a color cut that efficiently eliminates low - metallicity stars , but which excludes only a small fraction of metal - rich objects , as it can be deduced from figure  1 of @xcite . in figure  [ f_contam ]",
    "we plot an estimate of the fraction of thin disk stars in the sample , assuming 300 and 900  pc as thin and thick disk scale height , respectively , and a thick disk local normalization of 12% @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the contamination in the case of a distance overestimate of 15% for thin disk objects .",
    "the curves can be considered an upper limit , because the color cut , unaccounted for in the calculation , could have removed part of the contamination . in the same figure",
    "we indicate the results of a rough empirical estimate , obtained fitting a double gaussian to the distribution of the vertical velocity component ( @xmath20 ) in five bins of 50  stars .",
    "the dispersions of the two gaussian components were kept fixed , and the only free parameter of the fit was the number of thin disk stars in the bin .",
    "the error bars show the results when varying @xmath5 in the range 14 - 16 and 35 - 40  km  s@xmath3 for the thin and the thick disk , respectively .",
    "this test was performed only for @xmath291 - 2  kpc , where both populations contribute by more than 20% of the objects , i.e. 10 stars in each bin .",
    "the empirical errorbars agree well with the curve obtained when the distance bias is considered , although the observed contamination fall - off with @xmath1 seems steeper than the modeled one .    in conclusion ,",
    "our sample is contaminated by thin disk stars , whose distances are overestimated .",
    "this affects even the estimate of their kinematics , which is also biased .",
    "therefore , we will not analyze the results for the thin disk , and we will limit our study to @xmath141.3  kpc , to avoid the strong contamination ( @xmath3050% ) of the nearest subsample .",
    "@xcite estimated that the halo contamination in the sample should be about 8% , hence we would expect 41 halo members among the 514 targets with @xmath141.3  kpc .",
    "the cut in @xmath20 removed 10 probable halo contaminants and , according to the statistics of @xcite , 18 of the excluded low - metallicity targets are expected to be halo stars . the cuts in @xmath7 and @xmath8 could also have removed some halo objects , but the effect of this cut is harder to quantify , because an unknown fraction of the outliers are probably objects with problematic proper motion or wrong distance . the residual halo contamination in our sample of 412 targets should therefore be lower than @xmath63% ( 13 stars ) , and it can be safely neglected .",
    "the spectra were collected during six observing runs between 2005 and 2007 , at la silla and las campanas observatories .",
    "the details of the observations and data reduction were presented in @xcite , and we will outline here only the most relevant points .",
    "four different telescopes were used , because the stars span a wide range in magnitude ( @xmath8=516 ) , but the instruments had similar characteristics .",
    "the basic information of the runs is given in table  [ t_obs ] .",
    "the spectra covered the whole visual range from the atmospheric cutoff on the blue side to @xmath69000   , except for coralie data which only reached 6800    on the red edge .",
    "we did not reduce the spectra collected with the mike blue arm because of too low stellar flux , and mike data were thus limited to 4850    on the blue end . the spectral resolution varied between 32000 and 50000 , depending on the spectrograph .",
    "in particular , the 0@xmath317 slit was always used for mike runs ( r=32000 ) , while at dupont both the 0@xmath3175 and 1@xmath32 slits were used ( r=40000 and 30000 , respectively ) , depending on weather conditions . during each run",
    "we secured the spectra of up to seventeen bright stars with accurate parameters from the literature ( radial and rotational velocities , temperature , gravity , metallicity ) .",
    "exposure times were chosen according to weather conditions , to reach s / n=70100 for all the targets .",
    "comparison lamp arcs were acquired only during daytime calibrations for the fiber spectrographs coralie and feros .",
    "the second fiber of these two instruments was allocated to the sky background , because the spectra were usually collected next to full moon .",
    "lamp arcs were collected at intervals of about 2 hours during dupont and mike runs , and each spectrum was calibrated with the average of the two lamps temporally enclosing it , linearly weighted by the temporal distance between science and calibration frames .",
    "spectra were reduced with standard iraf[multiblock footnote omitted ] tasks , and we kept the procedures as much as possible identical for all the data .",
    "we a posteriori verified that the reduced feros and coralie spectra were of the same quality as the products of their dedicated pipelines .",
    "we analyzed the dark frames collected for all the runs , but we always found a negligible instrumental dark current and no clear 2d pattern , hence no dark correction was applied .",
    "the wavelength calibration lamp spectra were extracted in the same position on the ccd as science targets , to avoid systematics introduced by the curvature of the orders .",
    "the spectrum of a bright , well - exposed star was used to trace the orders on the ccd in each observing night , allowing only for rigid shifts among the frames .",
    "then , the spectra were extracted with an optimum extraction algorithm @xcite , normalized , and finally merged .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) for all the targets was measured with a cross - correlation ( cc ) technique @xcite as implemented in the iraf _ fxcor _ task .",
    "the procedure was described in detail in @xcite , and we give only a brief summary here .",
    "the spectrum of each star was cross - correlated with three template stars observed in the same run , namely hd180540 , hd223559 , and hd213893 ( this last replaced by hd224834 for coralie data ) , encompassing the temperature range of the targets .",
    "their rv was fixed by a cc with a synthetic spectrum generated with the spectrum code @xcite , because we found poor agreement between the available literature sources .",
    "the analysis of the seventeen standard stars acquired during observations , and of the solar spectra collected each night , revealed that the rv zero - point thus defined was biased by 0.3 - 0.7  km  s@xmath3 , depending on the instrument , and this offset was removed .",
    "the three measurements were averaged , although they never differed by more than 0.2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the cc was restricted to the range 4600 - 6800    ( 5000 - 6800    for mike data ) , to avoid the poor - quality blue section and the telluric bands at longer wavelengths .",
    "all rvs were corrected to heliocentric velocities , then the position of the telluric band at 6875    was used to correct the rvs for instrumental effects , mainly caused by a displacement on ccd between the lamp and science spectra , and an off - center position of the star inside the slit ( see , for example , the analysis of * ? ? ?",
    "corrections of up to 2  km  s@xmath3 were applied , but with little scatter ( @xmath60.5  km  s@xmath3 ) within each observing night .",
    "the final rv errors were estimated as the quadratic sum of the five relevant uncertainties introduced in the procedure : the cc and wavelength calibration error , the uncertainty on the zero - point and its offset , and the error on the estimate of the correction for instrumental effects .",
    "the resulting errors were typically in the range 0.4 - 0.7  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the final rvs of all the 824 stars will be made available at the cds website .",

    "our results agree excellently with literature sources : the mean difference ( in the sense ours@xmath38literature ) is 0.4@xmath262.7  km  s@xmath3 , where the uncertainty is the rms of the differences . the comparison with the works that share with us more than five stars in common is given in table  [ t_lit ] .",
    "the mean rv difference is always of the order of 1  km  s@xmath3 , except for @xcite , whose rvs are higher than ours by a non - negligible amount ( @xmath65  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the number of stars in common is too small to conclude that this offset is significant .",
    "the proper motion , radial velocity , and distance of each target were combined to derive its ( @xmath39 ) velocity components in the galactic cylindrical reference frame , where @xmath7 is positive toward the galactic center , @xmath8 is directed in the sense of galactic rotation , and @xmath20 points toward the north galactic pole .",
    "the error on these velocities was derived propagating the uncertainty on the observed quantities .",
    "we assumed a proper motion error of 3  mas  yr@xmath3 for all the stars , as this value is more realistic than the uncertainties quoted in the spm3 catalog ( t. girard , 2009 , priv .",
    "see also @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities were corrected subtracting the solar peculiar motion ( @xmath40)=(10.0 , 5.1 , 7.2 )  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently proposed the revised values ( @xmath40)=(11.0 , 12.2 , 7.3 )  km  s@xmath3 , but we preferred to adopt the older ones , for sake of continuity with previous works . in any case , the definition of the solar motion does not affect the velocity dispersions nor the off - diagonal terms of the dispersion matrix ( equation  [ e_cross ] ) , while the effects on the mean values are discussed in section  [ s_resmean ] .",
    "the sample was then divided into several bins , in which we calculated the mean velocities , the dispersions ( @xmath41 ) , and the non - diagonal terms of the dispersion matrix @xmath42 where the sum is extended to all the stars in the bin , and @xmath43 .",
    "the results are given in table  [ t_res ] .",
    "the bins were defined by the requirement that their centers were equally spaced by 0.1  kpc from @xmath1=1.5 to 4.5  kpc , to uniformly sample the variation with @xmath1 of the kinematical quantities , while the width was imposed by the fixed number of stars per bin ( see below ) .",
    "this implied a partial overlap of the bins , increasing with distance from the plane due to the decreasing density of observed stars .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that the binning definition does not alter the results , and in fact our results are very similar to that work , despite the very different binning schemes .",
    "the bins with @xmath442.4  kpc comprised 50  stars each , while at lower heights , where the number of observed stars is larger , the bin size was increased to 80  targets for 2.1@xmath452.4  kpc , and 100 targets for @xmath462.1  kpc .",
    "we thus ensured a good statistic of thick disk stars in bins contaminated by the thin disk .    in each bin , the mean value and dispersion of each velocity component were measured by means of the analysis of the corresponding probability plot @xcite .",
    "this powerful tool is highly insensitive to outliers , and it can be employed even in case of poorly populated bins .",
    "the data are first ordered with increasing value of the velocity .",
    "each point @xmath47 is then assigned a value @xmath48 , equal to the deviation from the mean expected for the @xmath49 point of a normal distribution , in units of the standard deviation . when the underlying distribution is gaussian",
    ", the data follow a linear relation in the @xmath48-velocity plane , whose intercept and slope are given by the mean value and the dispersion , respectively .",
    "the probability plots were fitted with a straight line , weighting each data point by its error , two examples are shown in figure  [ f_probplot ] .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersions were then obtained quadratically subtracting the mean velocity error in the bin .",
    "the wings of the distribution showing any deviation from linearity were excluded from the fit , suspected to be affected by objects with wrong distance or problematic proper motion , or by residual halo members .",
    "the analysis of artificial data samples , generated through monte - carlo simulations and analyzed as the real data , indicated that the velocity dispersion is underestimated by 1 - 2  km  s@xmath3 when the thin disk contamination approaches 10% .",
    "the contamination was therefore neglected for @xmath442.5  kpc , where it is expected to be lower than 5% ( i.e. two stars per bin , see figure  [ f_contam ] ) . following @xcite , in the presence of a non - negligible thin disk contamination ( @xmath462.5  kpc ) we derived the mean velocity and the dispersion of thick disk stars fitting only the wings of the probability plot , and only the negative one for @xmath8 .",
    "the cut excluded the ranges @xmath17u@xmath1850  km  s@xmath3 , @xmath17w@xmath1830  km  s@xmath3 , and @xmath5060  km  s@xmath3 , approximatively 1.5  times the expected thin disk dispersion , thus removing about 90% of the contaminants .",
    "the two wings of the probability plot should have the same slope but a different intercept , and the mean velocity was obtained averaging the two intercepts obtained from the fit . although the mean values thus derived agree well with the trends observed in the contamination - free bins at higher @xmath1 , we regard them as less reliable",
    ".    the formal errors of the least - square procedure used to obtain the intercept and the slope in the probability plots mainly indicate the deviations from gaussianity of the observed distribution .",
    "hence , they are not a good estimate of the real uncertainties .",
    "the errors were therefore derived by means of monte - carlo simulations . for each bin",
    ", we generated one thousand artificial samples of 50 stars , changing the proper motion , distance , and rv of each star assuming a gaussian random noise with dispersion equal to the estimated errors ( 3  mas  yr@xmath3 , 20% , and 0.4 - 0.7  km  s@xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "the measurements were repeated in each artificial bin as done for the real data , and the dispersion of these artificial measurements was assumed as an estimate of the observational errors .",
    "the final errors are given in table  [ t_res ] .",
    "the non - diagonal terms of the dispersion matrix , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , were calculated by means of equation  [ e_cross ] .",
    "the errors were estimated from monte - carlo simulations , as done for the velocity dispersions . for each bin ,",
    "one thousand artificial data sets of 50  values were simulated , drawn from a distribution characterized by the same dispersion matrix as the real data . in each simulation , a gaussian random noise with a dispersion equal to the observational errors was added , and the non - diagonal terms were estimated by means of equation  [ e_cross ] .",
    "the errors were defined by the scatter of these simulated measurements . with the same simulations we also evaluated the systematic error introduced by the observational uncertainties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comparing the results when the random noise was considered or not .",
    "we found that the expected systematic thus introduced is negligible , being about one order of magnitude lower than the uncertainties on the measured values .",

    ". the differences with @xcite can be at least in part due to the aforementioned expected decrease of the gradient with distance from the plane , because the results for @xmath5 are consistent , and the solutions proposed for the other two components overlap in the @xmath0-range in common ( 1.52.2  kpc ) .",
    "on the contrary , @xcite studied our same sample , and the different data analysis must be the cause of the disagreement .",

    "the linear fit presented in section  [ s_resangles ] also implies @xmath95(2  kpc)=@xmath104 .",
    "however , we derive a vertical gradient ( @xmath105  kpc@xmath3 ) much shallower than the predictions of @xcite for both mond ( 5@xmath101  kpc@xmath3 ) and newtonian dynamics ( 6@xmath101  kpc@xmath3 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "our observations agree better with the models that @xcite derived for mond than with those from newtonian dynamics , but the extension of @xcite calculations to higher @xmath1 , and to specific initial conditions for the thick disk , are required to perform a reliable test of the gravitational law .",
    "the vertical profile of @xmath106 shows a puzzling behavior between 2.5 and 3.5  kpc from the galactic plane ( top panel , figure  [ f_disp ] ) , where the dispersion deviates from the linear trend .",
    "a similar feature is clearly observable in the trend of other quantities related to the radial velocity component @xmath7 , like @xmath54 and @xmath52 ( as already noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but deviations from the linear trend in the range @xmath1=2.53  kpc could be present even in other profiles , such as @xmath65 , @xmath107 , @xmath80 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the origin of this behavior is unclear .",
    "it is possible that a group of comoving stars , forming a sub - structure in the galactic thick disk , is affecting the measured kinematics between 2.5 and 3.5  kpc from the plane . in particular , the similarity of the profile of two totally unrelated quantity such as @xmath108 and @xmath106 is instructive , because it excludes the possibility that this behavior is only due to some bad measurements . in any case , the existence of a kinematical substructure among our stars can not be claimed on the basis of these results only .",
    "our targets are distributed in a very narrow range of @xmath109 , and the data do not provide any direct information about the radial behavior of the kinematical quantities .",
    "nevertheless , some indirect indication can be derived . manipulating the radial jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates in steady state , with the radial component of the force expressed as f@xmath110",
    ", we obtain : @xmath111 where we also assumed that @xmath112 , @xmath113/@xmath114=0 , and that the density decays exponentially with both @xmath109 and @xmath0 , with scale length @xmath115 and scale height @xmath116 . inserting the observed quantities in the right hand side of equation  [ e_jeans ]",
    "we can thus estimate , as an exercise , the radial behavior of @xmath4 .",
    "the large uncertainties involved prevent a precise measurement , but the comparison with the expectations provides a consistency check for the kinematical data here presented , because an unphysical result could indicate a problem with them .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ f_jeans ] , where we assumed @xmath115=3.6  kpc and @xmath116=0.9  kpc @xcite , r@xmath98=8  kpc , and @xmath117=220  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the data points are scattered around the mean value @xmath118  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , following the behavior of @xmath106 discussed in section  [ s_comove ] , with no clear vertical trend . in the nearest bins the results are partially consistent , but more negative , than what found by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath119  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 ) , although neese & yoss refer to the thin disk .",
    "the observations show @xcite that @xmath5 should exponentially decay in the radial direction , with the same scale length of the mass density .",
    "this is often considered valid even for @xmath4 , under the assumption of a constant anisotropy , and @xcite found that this should be the best approximation at the solar position .",
    "the results also roughly agree with the expectation of this model , as shown in figure  [ f_jeans ] . in conclusion ,",
    "the presented kinematics implies a radial behavior of @xmath4 consistent with both previous observations and with the expectations of theoretical predictions .      the presence of kinematical gradients in the galactic thick disk is a powerful diagnostic to discriminate between the various models of its formation @xcite , but unfortunately the model expectations concerning the vertical gradient have not been investigated so far",
    ". it would be interesting to compare , in the near future , the predictions of the various models with the observed trend with @xmath0 of the velocity dispersions .",
    "on the contrary , the radial gradient of the dispersions has been modeled in the context of thick disk formation through disk heating by the merging of minor satellites @xcite .",
    "the observations of @xcite agree with the results of these simulations , provided that a low inclination orbit of the merging satellite is assumed .",
    "a similar conclusion is drawn comparing our measurements of @xmath4/@xmath5 with the theoretical expectations of the merging scenario .",
    "in fact , the simulations showed that this ratio is strongly linked to the inclination angle of the orbit @xcite , and our result ( @xmath4/@xmath5=2.08 ) favors a small inclination angle , @xmath120030@xmath101 ( see figure  15 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a low inclination orbit of the infalling satellite is also required to reproduce the rather large vertical gradient of the rotational velocity , found in this work as in previous investigations @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the radial migration model predicts a much shallower gradient ( @xmath3817  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , incompatible with the observations .    in conclusion",
    ", the models of thick disk formation have so far provided only fragmentary predictions about its kinematical properties , and our observations can not still be used to fully discriminate between them .",
    "however , we find that our results are consistent with the scenario where the thick disk formed through dynamical heating of a pre - existing galactic disk , induced by the merging of a minor satellite .",
    "moreover , all the kinematical evidence shows that , if this is the correct model , a low - latitude ( @xmath121 ) merging event is strongly preferred .",
    "we have analyzed a sample of @xmath6400 thick disk stars , measuring the variation of their kinematical properties as a function of distance from the galactic plane , from @xmath1=1.5 to 4.5  kpc .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * while the mean vertical velocity component @xmath56 shows no significant deviation from zero in the whole range , between 1.5 and 3  kpc , we find a net radial motion of about 20  km  s@xmath3 directed toward the galactic anticenter .",
    "other authors have recently found evidence for a similar behavior , proposing an inward motion of the lsr , although our mean velocity is larger than their proposed value by a factor of two .",
    "however , we find that @xmath54 changes sign for @xmath1223  kpc , and that a radial motion of the lsr , although not excluded , can not alone explain this behavior .",
    "* the mean rotational velocity of the thick disk decreases with distance from the galactic plane , as found by many previous investigations .",
    "the linear fit of our data returns a gradient of @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , our data points and the results of three other previous works are globally better represented by a power - law with index 1.25 , very similar to what has recently been proposed by @xcite . *",
    "all the velocity dispersions steadily increase with distance from the galactic plane , closely following a linear relation .",
    "the gradients we found are , however , smaller than those proposed by previous works .",
    "* while the velocity dispersions increase with @xmath1 , the ratios @xmath123 and @xmath124 show no significant vertical trend . the observations thus indicate a substantial constancy with @xmath1 of the anisotropy . *",
    "we find a non - negligible vertex deviation , increasing with @xmath1 from values close to zero to @xmath86 at @xmath1=3.5  kpc .",
    "this is consistent with previous investigations , which found a very small vertex deviation of old stellar population close to the galactic plane .",
    "* the tilt angle steadily increases with distance from the galactic plane .",
    "as expected , the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid in the @xmath7-@xmath20 plane results , at any @xmath1 , intermediate between alignment with the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems . according to calculations by @xcite , the tilt angle at @xmath1=2  kpc coincides with the expectation of mond , although the extension of their models to higher galactic heights is required to perform a conclusive test of the underlying gravitational law . *",
    "the vertical trend of many kinematical quantities show deviations from linearity between 2.5 and 3.5  kpc .",
    "the origin of these features is unknown , but it could indicate the presence of a sub - structure at this galactic height , such as a comoving group of stars . *",
    "the results are fully consistent with the model of thick disk formation through dynamical heating of a pre - existing galactic disk . if this is the correct scenario , a low inclination angle of the merging event is strongly preferred .",
    "however , not all the models proposed so far could be tested by our observations , and more simulations are required to obtain a detailed comparison able to discriminate between them .",
