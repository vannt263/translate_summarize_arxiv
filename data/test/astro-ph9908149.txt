    "type ia supernovae ( sne ) have recently been used extensively for the measurement of relative distances to galaxies ( , hamuy  1996 ; filippenko & riess 1999 ; branch 1998 ; and riess , press & kirshner 1996 ) . with peak @xmath3-band",
    "absolute magnitudes ranging ( typically ) from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , type ia sne have been discovered in ever - increasing numbers at redshifts ( @xmath6 ) well out in the hubble flow  the 29 type ia sne of the survey ( hamuy  1996 ) , supplemented by the seven new sne from the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) survey ( riess  1998 ) , are testament to this fact .",
    "the dispersion in the raw survey @xmath7-band hubble diagram alone is only @xmath8 , @xmath90.15mag tighter than the @xmath7-band relationship ( sakai   1999 ) .    in recent years , it has become clear that type ia sne are not standard candles of constant luminosity . significant dispersion in their peak luminosities , particularly in the @xmath3 and @xmath7 bands , has now been unequivocally demonstrated ( , phillips 1993 ; hamuy  1996 ; riess   1996 , 1998 ; phillips  1999 ) ; fortuitously , though , these same groups emphasize that there is a strong correlation between sne light - curve shape and peak luminosity .",
    "this is perhaps best appreciated through figure 8 of phillips  ( 1999 ) , in which the correlation between peak luminosity and decline rate @xmath10 is shown .",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to the decline in @xmath3-band magnitude from maximum to @xmath11 days after @xmath3 maximum . correcting the observed peak magnitudes for this decline rate effect results in a @xmath7-band hubble diagram dispersion of 0.14mag ( hamuy  1996 ) .",
    "while the hubble diagrams , whether they be raw or corrected for decline - rate effects , can provide highly accurate relative distances , the derivation of an actual hubble constant , h@xmath1 , requires that a locally - calibrated zero point be provided ; with the launch of @xmath12 , this zero point can now be provided via independent , cepheid - based , distance determinations for nearby type ia sne - host galaxies .",
    "providing such a zero point is the goal of the sandage / saha _ type ia sne hst calibration program _",
    "( saha  1997 , and references therein ) . to date , six galaxies have been targeted by the sandage / saha program ( ngc  3627 , 4496a , 4536 , 4639 , 5253 , and ic 4182 ) ; each galaxy s associated type ia sn , metallicity , and _ hst _ proposal i d number is listed in table [ tbl : galaxies ] .",
    "this list of six is supplemented by two others  ngc 3368 ( host to sn  1998bu ) , from tanvir  ( 1995 ) and ngc 4414 ( host to sn 1974 g ) , from turner  ( 1998 ) .",
    "three further local type ia - host galaxies will be observed by sandage / saha during _ hst _",
    "cycles 79 ( ngc  1316 , 4527 , and 3982 ) and , for completeness , are also listed in table [ tbl : galaxies ] .    as part of the _ hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ,",
    "cepheid - based distance determinations have been made for 18 galaxies , including one local , calibrating , type ia sne - host ( ngc  4414  turner  1998 ) .",
    "this ensemble is now being employed as calibration for a variety of secondary distance indicators probing further into the hubble flow , including the relationship ( sakai  1999 ) , surface brightness fluctuations ( ferrarese  1999 ) , fundamental plane ( kelson  1999 ) , and , of course , type ia sne ( this work ) . _",
    "this paper differs somewhat from these other calibrations of secondary methods in that we now focus on the recalibration of extant cepheid data .",
    "it presents results from a search for cepheids in all galaxies observed with _",
    "hst that are host to type ia supernovae .",
    "the goal of the present analysis is to process the remaining non-_key project , _ hst - observed , type ia sne - host galaxies in a manner consistent with that employed throughout the earlier papers in our series .",
    "while parallel double - blind reductions were not employed for the present recalibration work ( as was done for papers i - xxiii ) , the philosophy adopted for the seven galaxies described herein _ is consistent with that used for our earlier _ key project galaxies .",
    "this ensures that these galaxies are on the same footing as our original sample of 18 , and provides a useful cross - check of the sandage / saha and tanvir   independent reductions .",
    "a benefit of our re - analysis is that not only do we have a better understanding of the subtleties of accurately calibrating wf / pc and wfpc2 data , but we are in a position to take advantage of additional archive data for one of the galaxies ( ngc  5253 ) , that was not available to the original authors . _",
    "_ _ _ _    in section [ previous ] , results from previous type ia supernova studies are briefly summarized . in section [ data ] , we briefly remind the reader of this standard _",
    "hst key project _ reduction and calibration pipeline , then discuss the new photometric reductions , cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relations , and distances to each cepheid calibrator galaxy , and then compare them to previous results .",
    "the cepheid photometry for our reanalysis is provided in an appendix .",
    "section [ implications ] is devoted to the implications for h@xmath1 work implied by our uniform re - analysis of the local type ia sne calibrators ; these implications hold for all the empirical studies of table [ tbl : h0_ia ] ; for brevity , only two analyses ( those due to suntzeff  1999 and saha  1997 ) are followed in detail .",
    "the role of a possible metallicity correction to the cepheid - derived distances is discussed in section [ metallicity ] , while the local flow field and its impact upon h@xmath1 is described in section [ flow ] .",
    "we re - visit the type ia sne - predicted distance to the fornax cluster in section [ fornax ] .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "using their five cepheid - based distances to local type ia sne - host galaxies , supplemented with an indirectly inferred distance to ngc  3627 , saha   ( 1997 ) derived zero points to their uncorrected @xmath3- and @xmath7-band hubble diagrams ( themselves , based equally upon the and asiago ( patat 1995 ) surveys ) . ignoring external systematic effects , their resulting hubble",
    "constant was @xmath13 . using only the uncorrected sample , but now including the @xmath14-band data , and ignoring those calibrators with poor photometry or without a direct cepheid - based distance determination , both hamuy  ( 1996 ) and riess  ( 1996 ) found @xmath15 , in agreement with saha et  al .    correcting for the light - curve shape - peak luminosity relationship , in both the high-@xmath16 _ and local calibrator sample ) , hamuy  ( 1996 ) , riess   ( 1996,1998 ) , phillips  ( 1999 ) , and suntzeff  ( 1999 ) , each found @xmath17 , despite the different approaches in the treatment of foreground and host galaxy extinction  , correcting the peak magnitudes for light - curve shape results in an approximate @xmath18% increase in . _    a variety of other type ia sne - related h@xmath1 determinations populate the literature .",
    "the subtle differences in each study are tied to the details of either the high-@xmath16 or local calibrator sample selection .",
    "for example , a preliminary analysis from our team ( madore  1999 ) led to a value for the hubble constant of h@xmath1=@xmath19 .",
    "for that study though , only three of the six type ia sne employed had direct cepheid - calibrated distances ; indirect distances to two fornax cluster sne were inferred via the cepheid distance to cluster member ngc  1365 ( silbermann  1999 ; see also section [ fornax ] ) . in the analysis which follows we have chosen to restrict ourselves only to those eight sne which have _ direct cepheid - calibrated distances ; as madore  rightly note , the inclusion of the two fornax sne has negligible impact upon the derived h@xmath1 . _    an alternative method , independent of the local , empirical calibration of the hubble constant , is the derivation of h@xmath1 based upon purely physical models of type ia sne explosions .",
    "this method will not be discussed in any detail in what follows , except to note that it is encouraging that the weighted mean of three recent _ theoretical _ type ia sne - h@xmath1 analyses ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 ; ruiz - lapuente 1996 ; iwamoto & nomoto 1998 ) is @xmath20 , in close agreement with the recent empirical values , to be discussed in section [ hamuy ]",
    ".    table [ tbl : h0_ia ] provides a useful summary of these recent type ia sne - based h@xmath1 determinations , including both physical and empirical methodologies .",
    "where available ( and where relevant ) , an attempt has been made to list the number of sne included in the adopted hubble diagrams , as well as the number of local calibrators employed in deriving the associated zero points .",
    "the associated mean peak @xmath3-band magnitude for each sample is likewise provided ; the notes to table [ tbl : h0_ia ] clarify whether said mean applies to the high-@xmath16 sample or the local calibrators .",
    "seven type ia sne - host galaxies , six from the sandage / saha team ( ngc  4496a , 4536 , 4639 , 5253 , 3627 and ic  4182 ) and one from tanvir  ( ngc  3368 ) , were extracted from the _ hst archive and processed with the _ key project s allframe ( photometry  stetson 1994 ) and trial ( variable finding ",
    "stetson 1996 ) pipeline , as documented thoroughly by stetson ( 1998 ) and hill  ( 1998 ) . for papers",
    "i - xxiii of the _ key project , we carried out a ( real - time ) parallel reduction , based on both dophot and allframe , using at least two different methods for finding the cepheids .",
    "we included in the final analysis only those cepheids which were in common to both analyses , but for consistency , generally quoted only the allframe results . in the present case ,",
    "the dophot results were already previously published by the sandage / saha team  , we did not undertake a parallel dophot reduction and , thus , the methodology employed is not _ identical to that used in papers i - xxiii of this series .",
    "_ _ _ _    for the allframe@xmath21trial analysis described here ,",
    "photometry , cepheid selection , and pl analyses were handled identical to each of our previous galaxies ",
    ", no special treatment was afforded any of the cepheid samples herein , and only those cepheids with good quality @xmath7- _ and @xmath14-band data were considered . as described in sections [ n4639]-[n4496a ] , for several of the galaxies analyzed by saha et  al . , these authors either ( a ) used a special pl - fitting scheme ( , ngc  4639 and 3627 ) , or ( b ) treated the @xmath14-band data specially in the derivation of the true modulus ( , ngc  4496a and ic  4182 ) . for those galaxies with peculiarities",
    "not encountered in earlier _ key project papers , details are provided in the appropriate subsections below .",
    "we discuss the reasons for the differences between previously published results and those in this paper , so that the reasons for the difference in the overall value of h@xmath22 derived in this paper are clear .",
    "as it turns out , there is not a single explanation for the differences we see compared to our standard pipeline processing procedure , but a variety of reasons .",
    "the full set of cepheids for each of the seven galaxies , is listed in appendix a , along with positional and photometric information . as alluded to previously",
    ", we have only retained those cepheids which have high quality @xmath7- _ and @xmath14-band photometry ; we made a conscious decision to not retain the lower quality candidates . because of this , the cepheid numbers in tables a1-a7 are typically smaller than the number listed in the corresponding saha  dophot analysis , since saha  provided a complete listing of both bona fide _ and lower - quality suspected cepheid candidates .",
    "epoch - by - epoch photometry , light - curves , and finding charts , for all the cepheids discovered in this work are available through the _ hst key project s web page .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    the _ key project s data were calibrated without the adoption of an explicit , analytic , correction for charge transfer effects ( cte ) , although the hill  ( 1998 ) calibration employed did correct for it in the mean . on the other hand ,",
    "the current data _ were analyzed with a developmental calibration which does treat cte ( stetson 1998 ) , although our quoted moduli , and the subsequent h@xmath1 analysis which follows , adopt the mould  ( 1999b ) transformation from the stetson ( 1998 ; s98 ) scale to that of hill  ( 1998 ; h98 ) ; this amounts to mean shifts of @xmath210.02mag ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath210.04mag ( @xmath14 ) , in the sense of h98 being greater than s98 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath210.07mag shift ( s98@xmath23h98 ) in the true modulus , and retains consistency with previous ( and current ) papers in this series .",
    "the two systems do agree at the @xmath91@xmath24 level , but unresolved discrepancies between the two have led us to conservatively adopt the hill  ( 1998 ) scale , in what follows . _ _      ngc  4639 , host to sn  1990n , is one of three local calibrators situated in the virgo cluster . of the 38 galaxies ( to date ) with cepheid - based distances ( ferrarese  1999 ; table 3 ) , ngc  4639 is the current record - holder ; saha  ( 1997 ) derive a true modulus of @xmath25 , based upon 17 cepheid candidates .",
    "our allframe@xmath21trial analysis uncovered 17 high - quality cepheid candidates , seven of which were in common with the saha  ( 1997 ; table  4 ) sample .",
    "the majority of our sample ( , 14/17 ) reside on chips  2 and 3 .",
    "positional and photometric information for the full sample is given in table [ tbl : n4639_ceph ] .",
    "the first entry of table [ tbl : ceph_comp ] shows that the agreement in assigned mean @xmath7-band magnitudes , for the seven cepheids in common between table [ tbl : n4639_ceph ] and saha  ( table  4 ) , is excellent .",
    "however , as is the case for many of the galaxies discussed in this paper , the agreement in the @xmath14-band is somewhat inferior ( although the agreement does hold at the @xmath26 level ) .",
    "our @xmath7- and @xmath14-band pl relations are shown in figure [ fig : n4639 ] .",
    "standard pl - fitting to the full sample results in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , e@xmath29 , and @xmath30 ; the quoted uncertainties simply reflect the rms scatter of the fits , which includes the effects of the finite width of the instability strip as well as of random observational noise .",
    "a full accounting of the error budget ( detailed in table [ tbl : error ] ) leads to our final adopted value of @xmath31 . in comparison , recall that saha  ( 1997 ) found @xmath25 ",
    ", our result places ngc  4639 0.2mag nearer than that favored by saha et  al ( although still in agreement at the @xmath32 level ) .",
    "saha  ( 1997 ) interpret their dophot pl relations as showing evidence for significant scatter beyond that encountered in previous galaxies ( indicative of a substantial component of differential reddening ) , and thereafter employ a weighting scheme in averaging the sample of de - reddened cepheid moduli , in order to derive the galaxy s true modulus",
    ". we would suggest that upon closer inspection the evidence presented therein for differential reddening is perhaps not as suggestive as might at first seem .",
    "first , of the 15 cepheids employed by saha  ( neglecting the same three which they discard in deriving the true modulus , but which are still plotted in their apparent @xmath7- and @xmath14-band moduli pl relations - , their c1-v3 , c3-v8 , and c3-v9 ) , only two lie outside the lmc @xmath7-band @xmath33 instability strip width ( @xmath34mag ) .",
    "our analysis ( upper panel of figure [ fig : n4639 ] ) found one candidate lying outside this region .",
    "formally , the random uncertainties associated with the dereddened pl fit to the respective samples ( , entry r3 of table [ tbl : error ] ) are @xmath35mag ( allframe ) and @xmath36mag ( dophot ) , so while the scatter in the saha  dereddened moduli distribution is marginally larger than that found in our allframe@xmath21trial analysis , in neither case is the scatter anomalously large in comparison with the entire set of _ hst - observed galaxies . a simple visual inspection of our allframe pl relations ( and the listed @xmath7- and @xmath14-band scatter in each panel ) for ngc  4639 ( figure [ fig : n4639 ] ) , in comparison with those for the other galaxies in this study ( figures [ fig : n4536]-[fig : n4496a ] ) , do not show a significantly larger scatter",
    ". one can also do a formal fit to the distribution of cepheids in the differential reddening diagnostic plane ( , @xmath37 versus @xmath38 - figure 7 of saha  1997 )  for both the allframe@xmath21trial and dophot datasets , the formal slope of the least squares fit is @xmath39 .",
    "a slope of @xmath40 is expected in the case of photometric scatter alone , while a slope of @xmath41 is expected in the case where differential reddening is substantial - , statistically , we feel there is no compelling reason to invoke any substantial differential reddening component , and for these reasons , we have treated ngc  4639 in the same way as all of the other galaxies we have analyzed , taking the unweighted mean as the representative final galaxy modulus .",
    "the differing weighting schemes employed account for half of the discrepancy between the two analyses , while the remainder is due to the aforementioned ( unresolved ) @xmath14-band disagreement .",
    "_      ngc  4536 was host to sn  1981b , for which the light curve and photometry are of the highest quality .",
    "saha  ( 1996a ) derived moduli of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , and a total line - of - sight reddening of e@xmath45 , based upon the 27 highest - quality cepheids ( , @xmath46 ) in their table  3 .",
    "our allframe@xmath21trial analysis resulted in the sample of 39 candidates listed in table [ tbl : n4536_ceph ] .",
    "the @xmath7- and @xmath14-band pl relations are shown in figure [ fig : n4536 ] ; because of incompleteness below periods of 20 days , the formal pl fits were restricted to the 27 cepheids for which @xmath47d , and are represented by the solid lines ( , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "our final true modulus is @xmath50 .",
    "our predicted true distance modulus appears 0.15mag discrepant with that of saha  ( 1996a ) ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "examining the saha  data on a chip - by - chip basis , demonstrates though that this discrepancy results ( partially ) from what appears to be a discrepant chip within their dataset .",
    "if we apply the same color ( @xmath51 ) , period ( p@xmath5220d ) , and quality - index ( qi@xmath53 ) cuts adopted by saha  ( 1996a ) , and then perform the standard pl fitting to ( a ) the sum of chips @xmath54 ( 17 cepheids ) , and ( b ) chip 2 alone ( 12 cepheids ) , we find that ( a ) @xmath55(random ) and ( b ) @xmath56(random ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : n4536_mod_comp ] illustrates this 0.66mag chip  2 discrepancy present within the saha  dataset , where the solid symbols represent the 17 chip  1 + 3 + 4 cepheids and the open symbols the 12 chip  2 cepheids ; the solid and dotted horizontal lines correspond to the unweighted mean of each respective sample .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : n4536_mod_comp ] shows that such a discrepancy does not exist in our allframe@xmath21trial dataset . because the saha  chips 1 , 3 , and 4 , are self - consistent , we feel that the true modulus derived from the mean of the cepheids therein  @xmath57  represents a better option than the originally published @xmath44 , as reflected by its entry under @xmath58 in table [ tbl : distances ] .",
    "the fact that our allframe@xmath21trial distance to ngc  4536 is 0.19mag greater than that derived from chips 1 + 3 + 4 of the saha  sample is consistent with that expected , based upon a comparison of mean magnitudes for the cepheids in common in the two datasets ( see relevant entry in table [ tbl : ceph_comp ] ) .",
    "host to the highly - reddened , but well - photometered , sn  1989b ( wells  1994 ) , ngc  3627 is the most recently observed galaxy by the sandage / saha type ia sne calibration team .",
    "the wfpc2 field is replete with dust lanes , and suffers from an extremely bright background . based upon a sub - sample of 25 cepheids , drawn from a master list of 68 ,",
    "saha  ( 1999 ) derive an true modulus of @xmath59 .    the allframe@xmath21trial analysis for ngc  3627 proved to be more challenging than that encountered for any previous galaxy .",
    "the problem stems , in part , from a distinct lack of bright local standards upon which to base the calibration .",
    "there are many bright objects in the field , but they are decidedly non - stellar , forcing the use of those comparatively faint calibrators which successfully avoid the dust lanes .",
    "in addition , even after eliminating all likely star clusters and background galaxies , the remaining stellar images are still @xmath950% broader than in the rest of the _ hst - observed galaxies . in practice",
    ", what this means , is that the median aperture correction ( in going from 2 to 5 pixel radius ) , for ngc  3627 , is @xmath600.362mag , while the median for all the other galaxies is @xmath600.192mag  , there is a 0.17mag difference in the aperture corrections for ngc  3627 . _    the source of this discrepancy is not obvious .",
    "perhaps all of the ngc  3627 observations were out of focus ; however , contemporaneous _",
    "key project wfpc2 ngc  3319 observations do not deviate from the median aperture correction noted previously .",
    "second , perhaps ngc  3627 is extremely rich in star clusters which are incorrectly being identified as stars .",
    "a third possibility is that the extremely high surface brightness of ngc  3627 is problematic ; however , the form of the stellar images in the low surface brightness regions of our frames do not appear appreciably different from those in the high surface brightness parts of the same images . _    in what follows , we have chosen the conservative approach , and adopted the second option - , using the full sample s median aperture corrections and making use of all of the data available to us . instead of the standard 0.05mag random photometry uncertainty used for other galaxies in this study ( , r1 in table [ tbl : error ] ) , for ngc  3627 we have assumed the more generous value of 0.15mag , to reflect the greater uncertainty associated with the adopted aperture corrections .",
    "our results should be reliable at this level .    in total ,",
    "36 high - quality cepheid candidates were discovered , the properties for which are listed in table [ tbl : n3627_ceph ] .",
    "eighteen of our cepheids are in common with the saha  ( 1999 ; table 4 ) sample , and as can be seen by the relevant entry to table [ tbl : ceph_comp ] , the agreement in the mean @xmath7-band magnitudes is excellent , although the @xmath14-band agreement is somewhat inferior ( agreement at the 2@xmath24 level only ) . based upon this common sample , we _ a priori expect that our allframe true modulus should be 0.17mag _ greater than that of saha  ( 1999 ) . _ _    the pl relations for ngc  3627 are shown in figure [ fig : n3627 ] , and possibly provide evidence for the presence of differential reddening , by the excess scatter beyond that expected from the finite width of the lmc instability strip .",
    "larger errors as a result of the difficulty in working against the high background may also contribute to the higher scatter .",
    "incompleteness , for p@xmath6125d , is apparent , so our preferred allframe@xmath21trial distance has been based upon the 17 cepheids with periods in excess of 25d .",
    "standard pl fitting , incorporating the full error budget , yields @xmath62 .",
    "had we included cepheids with periods less than 25days , our derived distance to ngc  3627 would decrease .",
    "in contrast , saha  ( 1999 ) derive the significantly larger modulus of @xmath59 . this 0.16mag _ greater modulus is at odds with that which we had predicted on the basis of the 18 cepheids in common ( recall , we expected the dophot modulus to be 0.17mag _ smaller than our allframe modulus ) .",
    "the source of the discrepancy appears to be due to the sample of cepheids used by both groups which are _ not part of the aforementioned `` common '' subset . restricting ourselves to only those cepheids used by each group in their respective pl fitting ( , the 25 used by saha  and the 17 used in our re - analysis ) , we show in figure [ fig : n3627_mod_comp ] the distribution of individually dereddened true moduli for each sample .",
    "_ _ _    the upper panel of figure [ fig : n3627_mod_comp ] shows the 25 saha ( 1999 ) cepheids , while the lower panel shows our 17 ; in both panels , the filled symbols represent the five cepheids which occur in both samples .",
    "the horizontal lines represent the unweighted mean of the dereddened moduli , hence the @xmath63 shown in the upper panel , which differs from the aforementioned saha  value of @xmath64 ( which represents their favored weighted mean ) .",
    "several points should be made regarding figure [ fig : n3627_mod_comp ]  first , the mean magnitudes of the ( small ) overlap sample are in good agreement , as was found for the larger sample described earlier .",
    "indeed , just using these five cepheids in common leads to @xmath65(random ) , _ regardless of whose photometry is adopted . of the 0.23mag discrepancy noted in figure [ fig : n3627_mod_comp ] , 0.14mag is being driven by the four saha  cepheids with @xmath66 ; removal of these four outliers leads to @xmath67(random ) , in better agreement with our favored @xmath68(random ) .",
    "further support for their excision comes from the fact that their inferred reddenings are all negative , as witnessed by their populating the lower - right quadrant of saha et  al.s figure  11 .",
    "the residual 0.09mag offset can be traced primarily to those @xmath69d cepheids in the saha  sample which were not recovered in our analysis ; those saha  cepheids _ not included in our analysis ( , the 20 open squares in the upper panel of figure [ fig : n3627_mod_comp ] ) , appear to lie , in the mean , 0.14mag beyond their five which overlap our sample .",
    "conversely , again in the mean , our cepheids _ not included in the saha  analysis ( , the 12 open circles in the lower panel of figure [ fig : n3627_mod_comp ] ) _ are self - consistent with the overlap sample . _ _ _ _    a clearer way in which to express the above is to simply note that the median _ and mean @xmath70 of our sample of 17 cepheids are equivalent ( @xmath71 versus 30.06 , respectively ) , while for the saha ( 1999 ) sample of 25 cepheids , the median and mean differ by 0.19mag ( @xmath72 versus 30.29 , respectively ) .",
    "we would argue , in this case , that the saha  _ median @xmath70 is a more robust measure of the true dophot distance to ngc  3627 , in agreement with that favored by our allframe@xmath21trial analysis . _ _      ngc  3368 was not part of the original sandage / saha sne ia program , simply because at the time of proposing , the galaxy had not played host to a suitable sn ; this fortuitously changed on 1998 may 9 , with the eruption of sn  1998bu .",
    "while the sn itself is highly extinguished , its light - curve and photometry are of the highest quality , and thus ideally suited for the h@xmath1 analysis which follows .",
    "tanvir  ( 1995 ) , as part of their leo  i group study , had earlier derived a cepheid - based distance to ngc  3368 of @xmath73 ( after addition of the 0.05@xmath74mag `` long - vs - short exposure '' correction - casertano & mutchler 1998 ) .    unlike the case for the _ key project sample , the roll angle was not fixed from epoch - to - epoch for ngc  3368 .",
    "hence , a master coordinate system was defined relative to the first ( chronologically - speaking ) epoch chip  2 image , and the allframe reduction performed on all four wfpc2 chips simultaneously . _",
    "eleven candidates were identified , their location in the resulting pl - plane denoted by the filled circles in figure [ fig : n3368 ] .",
    "an incompleteness bias , for periods less than @xmath75 days , not apparent in the published data of tanvir  ( 1995 ; figure 3 ) , is clearly present .",
    "because tanvir  did not include positional information for their seven cepheid candidates , we identified their subset , within our larger dataset , based upon their proximity to one another in the pl - plane .",

    "the substantial differences in these mean magnitudes remains unresolved at present , but can be revisited once tanvir  publish the full photometry for their cepheids and local standards .",
    "we note in passing that identifying such standards for the allframe analysis proved challenging .",

    "the reduction of the earlier wf / pc photometry proved challenging .",
    "the original dophot analysis led to @xmath79 and e@xmath80 ( saha  1995 ) . the large uncertainty on the latter allows for consistency with the measured galactic foreground reddening e@xmath81 ( schlegel  1998 ) .",
    "ngc  5253 is unique in that it played host to two potential type ia sne local calibrators , sn  1895b and 1972e .",
    "the quality of the photometry associated with sn  1895b is of low quality , and therefore we do not consider it further .",
    "the lightcurve and photometry for sn  1972e ( hamuy  1996 ) are of a decidedly higher quality ( although not of the same level as those discussed in sections [ n4639 ] to [ n3368 ] , primarily because observations did not begin until 5d past the peak , and so one must extrapolate back to the peak using template lightcurves ) and will be incorporated into the h@xmath1 analysis of section [ implications ] .",

    "the intrinsic reddening local to sn  1972e is measured by suntzeff  ( 1999 ) to be e@xmath83 ; if this is taken as a lower limit on the mean intrinsic reddening , then in combination with the aforementioned galactic foreground reddening , the implied total line - of - sight reddening is e@xmath84 .    because both wf / pc and wfpc2 data exist for ngc  5253 , slightly different reduction and calibration steps were employed .",
    "first , for the wfpc2 data , the stetson ( 1998 ) @xmath14-band calibration and cte corrections , based upon @xmath85  cen and ngc  2419 , were used .",
    "second , the @xmath7-band images were not taken with the usual f555w filter , but with f547 m ; the f547 m calibration is derived from seven observations of @xmath85  cen taken with the gain=14 electronics , at odds with the gain=7 electronics employed in the ngc  5253 observations .",
    "the @xmath85  cen zeropoints were therefore corrected with a ( gain=7)@xmath60(gain=14 ) zeropoint correction derived from f555w data on @xmath85  cen ; a separate correction was applied to each chip .",
    "the separately calibrated wf / pc and wfpc2 data for ngc  5253 differ by @xmath86mag in v , in the sense of wfpc2 being brighter , and @xmath87mag in i. the weighted average was then constructed and compared with the ground - based photometry from john tonry ( as reported in table 2 of saha  1995 ) .",
    "this average is heavily weighted in favor of the wf / pc observations , simply because of the far greater number of observations .",
    "we note also that object 3a in saha et  al.s ( 1995 ) table 2 turned out to be a clump of @xmath88 stars of comparable brightness in the higher - quality wfpc2 data , and was eliminated from the comparison with tonry s ground - based data .",
    "the @xmath7-band magnitudes differed by @xmath89 , in the sense of the ground - based photometry being brighter , and the @xmath14-band magnitudes differed by @xmath90 ( in the same sense ) . in comparison ,",

    "the inferred apparent moduli  @xmath95 and @xmath96  are significantly smaller ( , 0.15mag and 0.27mag in @xmath7 and @xmath14 , respectively ) than those favored by saha et  al , and at odds with the conclusions of the previous paragraph , based upon the bright calibrator stars in the field . we discuss the reasons for this difference below .",
    "there are five cepheids in common between saha  ( 1995 ) and table [ tbl : n5253_ceph ]  from our census , c02-c06 correspond to saha et  al.s c4-v2 , c3-v2 , c4-v4 c3-v3 , and c1-v2 , respectively .",

    "identical moduli ( both apparent and true ) and reddenings to those favored by our allframe analysis are found when using the saha et  al .",
    "dophot data , provided the same cepheid sample is used .",
    "the reason for the difference with saha et  al.s results is that of the five cepheids included in their @xmath14-band analysis  their c2-v3 , c3-v6 , c4-v3 , c3-v2 , and c4-v2  only the latter two were included in our final sample .",
    "our photometry has benefited from the wfpc2 supplement not available in 1994 . in some cases ,",
    "this has allowed us to better eliminate / include marginal cepheid candidates from the original saha  analysis .",
    "for example , c1-v2 and c3-v3 were discounted in the @xmath14-band analysis by saha  because of difficulty in assigning their mean magnitudes , while we found no reason to eliminate them based on their photometry ; both are clearly consistent with the pl fit of figure [ fig : n5253 ] , unlike the situation which faced saha  ( their figure 5 ; lower panel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "( i ) we did not recover their c2-v3 ; ( ii ) c4-v3 sits on a bad column ; and ( iii ) the lightcurve of c3-v6 is clearly non - cepheid - like , even in their own data ( their figure 4 ) .",
    "we have treated the seven cepheids in our final sample in a manner consistent with all of the other galaxies in the _ key project , and see no reason to reject any of them , based upon our allframe@xmath21trial analysis .",
    "_    we note also that our inferred mean reddening ( e@xmath97 ) , is larger than that found by saha  ( 1995 ) ( e@xmath80 ) .",
    "our higher value of reddening is in better agreement with other estimates of the reddening ( recall , the galactic foreground reddening is e@xmath98 ",
    "schlegel  1998 ) .",
    "in addition , over the inner @xmath99 ( half of our cepheids lie within @xmath100 of this region ) , the total line - of - sight reddening ( from @xmath101h@xmath102 ",

    "our adopted distance modulus for ngc  5253 , incorporating the full error budget , is @xmath104 .",
    "the main difference from that of the published saha  ( 1995 ) analysis ( , @xmath79 ) is due to the difference in adopted cepheid samples .",
    "the small scatter in our allframe pl relation and individual light curves , combined with the larger inferred reddening value , plus larger time baseline of the data analyzed here ( in a manner consistent with all previous _ key project galaxies ) , all give us confidence in the cepheid sample adopted in this paper . _    an independent check of our ( and saha et  al.s ) conclusions is provided by the sakai ( 1999 ) distance determination based upon the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) ; a preliminary analysis , using only ngc  5253 halo stars , places the tip at @xmath14=23.99 . for a tip absolute magnitude m@xmath105 ( ferrarese  1999 ) , and a galactic foreground extinction a@xmath106mag ( schlegel  1998 )",

    "an ultimate resolution to the discrepancy between each of these approaches to the distance of ngc  5253 is still forthcoming .",

    "the good agreement between these mean magnitudes and the ones we derived in section [ hamuy ] ( see the final two entries of table [ tbl : supernovae ] ) , despite the @xmath0mag systematic offset in the absolute distances ( recall table [ tbl : distances ] ) is largely a fortuitous one .",
    "it comes about due to the fact that saha  ( 1997 ) assume the observed sne peak magnitudes reflect the unextinguished values ( except in the cases of sn  1981b and sn  1989b ) , whereas suntzeff   ( 1999 ) solve for both the intrinsic and galactic foreground reddening .",
    "coupled with equations [ eq : saha_b ] and [ eq : saha_v ] , these lead to h@xmath170 kms@xmath156mpc@xmath156 and h@xmath171 kms@xmath156mpc@xmath156 , respectively .",
    "the weighted mean of these @xmath3- and @xmath7-band hubble constants is h@xmath172 .",
    "saha  ( 1997 ) use slightly different distances to the majority of their calibrators , in comparison with those published in their individual galaxy papers ; adopting these published distances to the galaxies in question leads to h@xmath173 , a 1.2% increase over that above . in comparison , adopting our best estimate of the distances to the six sandage / saha calibrators , based upon their original published dophot photometry ( column 3 of table [ tbl : distances ] ) , would yield h@xmath174 ( entry 7 of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) .    if we were to now replicate the analysis of saha  ( 1997 ) , again using their sne photometry and reddening parameters ( table 6 of saha et  al . ) , but now adopting the new allframe@xmath21trial distance moduli of table [ tbl : distances ] ( column 2 ) , the predicted mean peak magnitudes would be m@xmath175m@xmath176 , the mean @xmath3- and @xmath7-band peak magnitudes both decrease by @xmath90.21  mag .    in conjunction with equations [ eq :",
    "saha_b ] and [ eq : saha_v ] , these revised mean magnitudes lead to hubble constants of h@xmath177=@xmath178 and h@xmath179=@xmath180 .",
    "the weighted mean of these values is h@xmath181 ( entry 5 of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) .",
    "this value is directly comparable to the h@xmath182  alluded to earlier , in that the adopted hubble diagram ( equations [ eq : saha_b ] and [ eq : saha_v ] ) and sn lightcurve photometry ( table 6 of saha  1997 ) were chosen to be identical  the only difference here is the adopted absolute distances to the host galaxies in question .",
    "the adoption of the new distance moduli leads to an upward revision of the saha et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) h@xmath1 of 8.9% .",
    "saha  ( 1997 ) have noted that when correcting for the decline rate adopted by suntzeff  ( 1999 ) , the calibrators become @xmath90.1  mag more luminous than the distant sample .",
    "suntzeff ( 1999 , and earlier papers ) suggest that such an anomaly may be real , reflecting the morphological type ( and stellar population ) mismatch between nearby and distant host galaxies . on balance ,",
    "as summarized earlier , the case for a decline rate correction seems strong and hence our adoption of such an approach .",
    "saha  use a different type ia sne sample for deriving their hubble diagram .",
    "their derived decline rate - peak luminosity relationships ( in both @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) are @xmath910% shallower than those derived by suntzeff  ( 1999 ) and phillips  ( 1999 ) . using these saha  fits ( their equations 23 and 24 , with the associated zero points ) with the new allframe@xmath21trial distances to the same six calibrators employed above , leads to h@xmath1=@xmath183 , which is 4.5% greater than the value derived in the absence of any m@xmath184 correction ( , entries 5 and 6 of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) . in comparison , the steeper slope favored by suntzeff  ( 1999 ) results in an 8.3% increase in h@xmath1 ( , entries 1 and 5 of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) .      the results of sections [ hamuy ] and [ sandage ] were assuming no metallicity dependence of the cepheid pl relation .",
    "the dependence of the cepheid pl relation on metallicity has not yet been well  established ( , musella 1999 ; storm , carney & fry 1999 ; nevalainen & roos 1998 ; saio & gautschy 1998 ; webb  1998 ; kennicutt  1998 ; sasselov  1997 ; gould 1994 ; madore & freedman 1990 ) , with perhaps the best empirical determination of the magnitude of such an effect to date being that due to kennicutt  ( 1998 ) .",
    "kennicutt  performed a differential analysis of the pl relations in two fields of m101 , spanning a range of @xmath185dex in oxygen abundance , and found @xmath186=-0.24\\pm 0.16$]magdex@xmath156 .",
    "in other words , for any galaxy whose metallicity exceeds that of the reference galaxy - , the lmc , with @xmath187  by an order of magnitude , simply determining the absolute distance modulus via offsetting the apparent pl relations from those of the lmc , could lead to @xmath70 being underestimated by 0.24mag .    for each of the six high- and intermediate - quality calibrating sne of table [ tbl : galaxies ]",
    "kennicutt  ( 1999 ) have now shown that , in the mean , the metallicity of the cepheid fields , as measured by abundances , is 0.31dex greater than that of the lmc .",
    "recalling the kennicutt  ( 1998 ) result of @xmath186=-0.24\\pm 0.16$]magdex@xmath156 , this @xmath210.31dex metallicity offset from the lmc implies a typical correction factor of @xmath1880.07mag needs to be applied to the ensemble of calibrators .    using the abundances from table [ tbl : galaxies ]",
    ", we applied the appropriate kennicutt  ( 1998 ) correction to each of the individual calibrators , and then followed the identical decline rate - peak luminosity analysis described in section [ hamuy ] .",
    "this leads to a predicted hubble constant of h@xmath189 .",
    "in other words , applying a correction to the absolute distance moduli , based on kennicutt  ( 1998 ) relationship , results in a reduction in our adopted h@xmath1 of 4.4% ( entries 1 and 3 of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) .",
    "these two results agree to within @xmath91@xmath24 .",
    "the type ia supernova sample is sufficiently distant that use of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) reference frame is the standard to which the observed type ia sne host galaxy heliocentric velocities are transformed .",
    "here we test the assumption that correcting velocities for the local flow field does not introduce any significant systematic offset in the derived h@xmath1 .",
    "the cmb frame should , of course , be appropriate , as all but 5 of the 29 sne have recessional velocities in excess of 6000kms@xmath156 ( , a regime where peculiar velocities are @xmath190% the recessional velocity ) ; for the nearby sne , though , the peculiar velocities can be significant , so an effort has been made to estimate them .    to that end",
    ", we have employed the three - attractor ( virgo@xmath21great attractor@xmath21shapley ) model described by mould  ( 1999b ) , in order to correct the observed heliocentric velocities for the resultant flow field solution .",
    "we assume local group infall velocities of 200kms@xmath156 , 400kms@xmath156 , and 85kms@xmath156 , for virgo , the great attractor , and shapley , respectively . within this framework ,",
    "the adopted infall velocities reproduce the amplitude of the cmb dipole ( @xmath9630kms@xmath156 ) , but with only these three attractors , the direction of local group motion is @xmath920@xmath191 away from the cmb direction . as we are simply interested in assessing the magnitude of the effect , at this stage , fine - tuning the model to improve this vector offset was deemed unnecessary .",
    "starting from 29 sne ( hamuy  1996 ; table 1 ) , we adopted the hamuy  ( 1996 ) color cut to eliminate the three reddest sne ( sn  1990y , 1992k , and 1993h ) , and also eliminated the three which are either missing ( sn  1990 t and 1991s ) from zcat ( huchra 1999 ) , or have zcat velocities which are discrepant with those tabulated by hamuy et  al ( sn  1993ag ) .",
    "to this final sample of 23 type ia sne , we performed a weighted least squares fit of the form @xmath192 + c_2 \\label{eq : fit}\\ ] ] including errors in m@xmath193 and @xmath154 , but neglecting those in recessional velocity @xmath194 . restricting ourselves to the peak @xmath7-band magnitude @xmath195 and the cmb reference frame ( , @xmath196 in equation [ eq : fit ] ) ,",
    "for the adopted sample of 23 sne , we find @xmath197 and @xmath198 , with a dispersion @xmath199 .",
    "following the error analysis outlined in table [ tbl : error ] , and using the same six calibrators employed in section [ hamuy ] , this yields a @xmath7-band hubble constant of @xmath200 .",
    "conversely , if we now take the output of our three - attractor flow field model and replace @xmath201 , with the derived flow field velocities @xmath202 , the coefficients for equation [ eq : fit ] become @xmath203 and @xmath204 , with a dispersion @xmath205 .",
    "the resultant @xmath7-band hubble constant is then @xmath206 .",
    "comparison of the above results demonstrates that h@xmath179 increases by only 2.1% in going from the cmb to flow field reference frame .",
    "the same conclusion holds for h@xmath177 and h@xmath207 , not surprisingly .",
    "it is re - assuring to confirm that the two reference frames lead to hubble constants which are consistent at the @xmath138 level , as we had assumed , _ a priori . _      under the assumption that the fornax distance was defined by the silbermann  ( 1999 ) cepheid distance to ngc  1365 - , @xmath208 - the suggestion had been made ( , figure 4 of suntzeff  1999 ) that the ( two ) fornax cluster type ia sne appeared to lie @xmath90.35mag behind ngc  1365 ( a discrepancy , albeit only at the @xmath91.5@xmath24 level ) .",
    "indeed , the same apparent discrepancy with this earlier cepheid distance had been noticed in surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf , ferrarese  1999 ) and fundamental plane ( fp , kelson  1999 ) fornax studies . with the addition of new cepheid distances to ngc  1326a ( prosser  1999 ) and 1425 ( mould  1999a ) , though , the _ key project s favored fornax distance is now @xmath209 ( ferrarese  1999 ) , reducing the cepheid - sne distance discrepancy from the earlier @xmath91.5@xmath24 , to @xmath611@xmath24 .",
    "further , direct , fornax distance determinations , including sandage / saha s upcoming attempt at uncovering cepheids in ngc  1316 , will be an important aid in determining whether the earlier cepheid versus sbf / fp distance `` dichotomy '' has truly been resolved .",
    "regardless , as far as a type ia sne - based determination of h@xmath1 is concerned , the inclusion of these two additional fornax sne has little effect upon the derived result , save for the expected reduction in the final random uncertainty ( madore 1999 ) .",
    "_      table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] summarizes the results of sections [ hamuy]-[flow ] , illustrating the dependence of the derived hubble constant to the important constituents of the analysis , including the adopted peak luminosity - light curve shape correction , number of local calibrators , cepheid pl - metallicity , and reference frame .",
    "it is important to stress that all of the scenarios based upon our uniform allframe@xmath21trial analysis ( all but the final entry of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) are consistent , at the @xmath210 level , with our final , adopted , result of h@xmath211 ( , the initial entry of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) .",
    "it is reassuring that this result is so robust , considering , for example , the different approaches adopted in the treatment ( or lack thereof ) of the sne light curve shapes ( contrast the first and fifth entries of table [ tbl : h0_bkg ] ) .",
    "we have re - derived distances to seven type ia sne - host galaxies , using archival _ hst data , collected by two different , non-_key project programs .",
    "the methodology employed parallels that used in reducing and analyzing the 18 galaxies observed as part of the _ hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "this re - analysis has also benefited from the inclusion of additional archival data not available at the time of original reduction , as well as the experience and knowledge gained over the past five years in calibrating wf / pc and wfpc2 data .",
    "likewise , such cross - checking has uncovered several minor discrepancies in some of the earlier published results .",
    "_ _ _    the major result of our re - analysis is that , in the mean , the absolute distance modulus for these seven local type ia sne calibrators is @xmath0mag nearer ( weighted ) , on average , than those published originally by tanvir  ( 1995 ) and saha   ( 1994,1995,1996ab,1997,1999 ) .",
    "there are several reasons for the systematic differences , including differences in the photometry , cepheid samples , weighting of the data , and treatment of reddening .    using these new distances",
    ", we have re - calculated the relevant zero points to the hubble diagrams used by suntzeff  ( 1999 ) and saha  ( 1997 ) , in order to quantify their effect upon the predicted value of the hubble constant .",
    "properly weighting each galaxy and sn by its associated uncertainties shows that any previous empirical calibration tied to these local type ia sne calibrators will have underestimated h@xmath1 by @xmath212% .    formally ,",
