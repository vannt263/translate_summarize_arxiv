    "additionally , the honeycomb lattice has been shown to stage many different types of exotic physical behaviors in magnetism and the growing experimental evidence of non - fermi liquid behavior in graphite has led to the study of electron - electron correlations and quasi - particle lifetimes in graphite @xcite .    around a decade ago , sorella and tossatti @xcite found that the hubbard model in the half - filled honeycomb lattice would exhibit a mott - hubbard transition at finite @xmath0 .",
    "their monte carlo results were confirmed by variational approaches and reproduced by other authors @xcite . as important as",
    "the existence of the mott - hubbard transition in strongly correlated electron systems is the possible realization of nagaoka ferromagnetism .",
    "the triangular , the honeycomb and the kagom lattices were studied , but a strong tendency for a nagaoka type ground state was found only in non - bipartite lattices ( triangular and kagome ) @xcite . on the other hand , the effect of _ long range _",
    "interactions in half filled sheets of graphite was considered from a mean field point of view , using an extended hubbard model .",
    "a large region of the phase diagram having a charge density wave ground state was found @xcite .",
    "more recently , the existence of a new magnetic excitation in paramagnetic graphite has been claimed @xcite , but its existence was reanalyzed by two of the present authors @xcite .    in this work the magnetic phases of the hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice are studied .",
    "in addition to the two - dimensional problem we also address the three - dimensional system composed of stacked layers .",
    "the critical lines associated with instabilities of the paramagnetic phase are obtained in the @xmath5 plane ( interaction versus particle density ) .",
    "spiral spin phases are also considered . a ground state phase diagram containing ferro and antiferromagnetic order",
    "is obtained .",
    "interestingly , we find ferromagnetic regions with fully polarized spin in the vicinity of regions with smaller magnetization .",
    "the transitions from one to the other are discontinuous .",
    "we also address the calculation of the magnetic excitations ( spin waves ) in the half - filled antiferromagnetic honeycomb layer within the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "it is known that the hartree - fock - rpa theory of the half - filled hubbard model is correct in both weak and strongly interacting limits : at strong coupling , the spin wave dispersion obtained in rpa agrees with the holstein - primakoff theory for the heisenberg model ; at intermediate interactions ( @xmath6 ) , the rpa dispersion shows excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock - rpa theory should , therefore , be considered as a usefull starting point to study the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "starting from the spin wave spectrum obtained in rpa theory , we calculate the quantum fluctuations correction to the ground state magnetization arising from virtual emission / reabsorption of spin waves . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "we find a ground state magnetization which is about @xmath7 of full polarization .",
    "this is not so great a reduction as predicted by the holstein - primakoff theory of the heisenberg model , which is about @xmath8 .",

    "section [ fluctu ] contains a study of the renormalization of the electron s spectral function and magnetization by the spin wave excitations .",
    "the magnetic properties of the honeycomb lattice is discussed in the context of the hubbard model , which is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 are hopping integrals , @xmath0 is the onsite repulsion and @xmath13 denotes the chemical potencial .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is not a bravais lattice since there are two atoms per unit cell .",

    "an important feature is that @xmath44 vanishes linearly with @xmath45 as we approach the half filled limit , both for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is related to the @xmath48-points of the brillouin zone ( see figure [ honey ] ) , where the electron dispersion becomes linear : @xmath49 ( @xmath50 denotes the deviation from the @xmath48-point ) .",

    "we discuss the possibility of existence of magnetic excitations in a single honeycomb paramagnetic layer .",

    "@xcite a half - filled hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice ( with @xmath35 ) was considered but the tensorial character of the susceptibility was neglected @xcite . since inelastic neutron scattering can be used to study this spin collective mode in graphite , we decided to re - examine this problem taking into account the tensorial nature of the transverse spin susceptibility .",
    "collective magnetic modes with frequency @xmath60 and momentum @xmath61 are determined from the condition ( [ det ] ) after performing the analytic continuation @xmath62 .",

    "collective modes are only well defined outside the particle - hole continuum ( inside the continuum they become landau damped ) .",
    "we searched@xcite for well defined magnetic modes , @xmath67 , below the continuum of particle - hole excitations , and found no solutions for any value of the interaction @xmath0 . in figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite we plot @xmath68 for eight different @xmath10-vectors and @xmath60 ranging from zero to the point where the particle - hole continuum begins .",
    "our analysis reveals that the full tensorial structure of the hubbard model s rpa susceptibility in the honeycomb lattice does not predict a collective magnetic mode .",
    "the spin wave dispersion @xmath67 for the af layer with one electron per site can be obtained from equations ( [ chi0 ] ) and ( [ det ] ) using expressions ( [ gaa])-([gbb ] ) for the propagators .",
    "spin wave spectra , for different values of second - neighbor hopping , @xmath33 , are ploted in figures [ afsw ] and [ afswtp ] . in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "spin wave energies agree with those obtained from the holstein - primakoff theory of the heisenberg model .",
    "we give an analytical derivation of this limit in appendix [ appendsuslarge ] .",
    "the holstein - primakoff result for the heisenberg model in the honeycomb lattice , which is derived in appendix [ appendhp ] , can be written as @xmath69 this result can be mapped on the hubbard model provided that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ afsw ] shows the spin wave energies for the 2d lattice ( @xmath46 ) along a closed path in the brillouin zone .",
    "energies in figure [ afsw ] are normalized by the holstein - primakov result at the @xmath48-point , @xmath72 ( see figure [ honey ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the results for @xmath73 are very close to the asymptotic behavior of the rpa , whereas , for smaller @xmath0 , the spin wave energy is reduced .",
    "the effect of @xmath33 on @xmath67 is depicted in figure [ afswtp ] .",
    "it is of particular interest the fact that the dispersion along the @xmath74 direction is almost absent for @xmath75 .",
    "the presence of @xmath33 does not change this effect .",
    "the magnetic instabilities in the paramagnetic phase can be obtained from the divergence of the rpa susceptibilities at critical values of the interaction , @xmath76 , driving the system towards a magnetically ordered phase . at a given electron density @xmath1",
    "we always find two instability solutions , one ferromagnetic and one antiferromagnetic .",
    "one of these solutions minimizes the free energy . since @xmath76 is determined from @xmath77 , taking into account that @xmath64 and @xmath78 in the paramagnetic phase , we obtain : @xmath79 figure [ 2dcrit ] shows @xmath76 obtained from the static uniform susceptibilities ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , as a function of electron density for various values of @xmath33 .",
    "detailed equations for the instability lines are given in appendix [ appendsusuc ] .",
    "the left panel of figure [ 2dcrit ] refers to the 2d case , corresponding to a single honeycomb layer , whereas the right panel refers to the 3d system with a constant interlayer hopping @xmath82 .",
    "the van - hove singularity ( associated with the @xmath83 point ) plays an important role at density @xmath84 in the 2d case , independently of @xmath33 .    as we have already mentioned , the two solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ucrit ] ) correspond to two different magnetic transitions , one between a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase and another between a paramagnetic phase and an antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "that this is so can easily be confirmed by solving the self - consistent equations for the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic magnetizations , respectively , derived from the hf hamiltonian ( [ hamilthf ] ) . by minimizing the free energy with respect to magnetization , one finds the following expressions for ferro and antiferromagnetic magnetizations @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the fermi function and @xmath87 . letting both @xmath88 and @xmath89 approach zero , one obtains the same lines as those in figure [ 2dcrit ] . generally speaking , for electron densities lower than @xmath90 ,",
    "the value of @xmath76 that saparates the paramagnetic region from the ferromagnetic region is lower than the corresponding value of @xmath76 separating the paramagnetic region from the antiferromagnetic region .",
    "the critical @xmath0 associated with the ferromagnetic instability increases with @xmath33 .",
    "the size of the paramagnetic region in figure [ 2dcrit ] increases with @xmath33 . on the other hand , for @xmath91",
    ", we see that the critical line for the ferromagnetic region is very close the critical line of the antiferromagnetic region .",
    "therefore , the ferromagnetic region is progressively shrinking with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "if we now turn to densities larger than @xmath90 , we find that the antiferromagnetic critical line is the one with lowest @xmath76 . however , in contrast to lower densities , the antiferromagnetic critical line hardly changes when varying @xmath33 .",
    "this description applies equally well to the single honeycomb layer and weakly coupled layers , even though the quantitative functional dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath1 is different in the two cases , the main difference coming from the van hove singulary present in the 2d case . at finite temperature",
    "the van hove singularity is rounded off and the 2d phase diagram will be much more similar to the 3d case .",
    "we therefore , consider that a weak 3d inter - layer coupling does not qualitatively modify the conclusions valid for the 2d case .",
    "besides collinear spin phases , the system may also present non - collinear  spiral  spin phases in some regions of the phase diagram .",
    "we now study what are the changes in the critical @xmath0 values determining the instability of the paramagnetic phase if we allow for non - collinear ground states , since it is well known that the hubbard model on bipartite and non - bipartite lattices can have the lowest @xmath76 for spiral spin phases @xcite for some electronic densities . in a spiral state , the spin expectation value at site @xmath92 , belonging to sublattice @xmath93 , is given by @xcite @xmath94 if @xmath95 , the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin configurations become twisted",
    ". we shall refer to the twisted @xmath95 configurations as @xmath96 whenever @xmath97 , and @xmath98 whenever @xmath99 .",
    "the criterion for choosing the @xmath10-vectors is taken directly from the geometry of the lattice by requesting a constant angle between spins on neighboring sites , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately , however , this can not be achieved in the honeycomb lattice with only one @xmath10-vector .",
    "the closest one can get to a true spiraling state is by letting @xmath101 ( or equivalently , @xmath102 ) , which implies that @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) . for the moment we let @xmath105 be zero which means that we consider identical layers .",
    "the condition @xmath106 means that the increase in spin angle between two lattice sites in the @xmath107 direction is the same as the increase in spin angle between two lattice sites in the @xmath108 direction .",
    "there is no increase in the spin angle in the @xmath109 direction .",
    "examples of the spin - configurations obtained in this way are shown in figures [ example_1_q = pi/6 ] and [ example_2_q=2pi/3 ] .",
    "several notes are in order at this stage .",
    "first , although we do not have a true spiraling state over the whole lattice , we do have a spiraling configuration in the @xmath107 and @xmath108 directions , as can be seen from the figures [ example_1_q = pi/6 ] and [ example_2_q=2pi/3 ] , going from the lower left to upper right .",
    "secondly , when travelling along the @xmath109 direction , the spin angles do not increase . instead ,",
    "neighboring spins in this direction are always aligned ferromagnetically when @xmath97 , and antiferromagnetically when @xmath99 .",
    "however , two successive @xmath109 bonds ( sliding down the lattice from left to right ) have the same increase in spin angle as any two neighbors connected by @xmath107 or @xmath108 . the @xmath10-vector ( i.e. the spin configuration ) that a system with a given density would prefer is the one with the lowest value of @xmath110 . in figure [ minangle ]",
    "we present a curve showing the @xmath10 vectors that minimize @xmath111 , as functions of particle density @xmath1 .",
    "we consider discrete values @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath33 is overall the same as that discussed for @xmath114 ( for example , the shrinking effect with increasing @xmath33 is also seen here ) .",
    "there is no reason to restrict @xmath10 to integer multiples of @xmath115 , other than a pure computational one . by performing the same calculation with more @xmath10-vectors ,",
    "the step function like appearance of the lower graphs of figure [ minangle ] can be smoothed out .",
    "our analysis is sufficient , however , to get an insight into how the @xmath10 vectors ( which minimize @xmath76 ) vary with @xmath1 .",
    "the solid line limiting the paramagnetic region is shown in the lower graphs of figure [ minangle ] ) .",
    "we see that the behavior of @xmath116 , as function of @xmath1 , is almost the same for the 2d and 3d cases .",
    "as the system approaches half filling , the prefered spin configuration approaches that with @xmath117 . in a doped system , however , minimization of @xmath110 is attained for a non - zero @xmath10 .",
    "it is also seen that the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath1 is not monotonic . either in 2d or 3d",
    ", @xmath116 goes all the way from @xmath118 ( at @xmath119 ) to @xmath120 , displaying two local maxima ( and a local minimum in between ) as @xmath1 ranges from @xmath121 towards @xmath118 .",
    "the value of @xmath116 reaches a local minimum at @xmath122 , at @xmath123 ( in 2d ) or at @xmath124 ( in 3d ) . for even lower densities",
    ", @xmath116 attains another maximum at @xmath125 , which means that the spins of any two nearest neighbors , in the @xmath107 and @xmath108 directions , point exactly in opposite directions to each other .    the same type of behavior is seen also for the critical line separating magnetically ordered phases ( dashed line ) .",
    "again , the 2d and the 3d cases are very similar to each other . for densities around @xmath126 ( 2d ) and @xmath127 ( 3d ) , we have @xmath128 yielding the lowest @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the solid and the dashed lines coincide , illustrating the previously mentioned ferromagnetic shrinking out effect . in other words , for @xmath128 , the two solutions of @xmath110 almost coincide for all @xmath1 , leaving only a thin strip of ferromagnetism between the paramagnetic and the antiferromagnetic regions .",
    "although this is true for all @xmath1 , it is only for @xmath129 ( 2d case ) and @xmath130 ( 3d case ) that @xmath131 is minimum .",
    "so far , our analysis has been restricted to @xmath10-vectors lying in the @xmath132 spin plane .",
    "this means that two inter - layer neighbors have the same spin .",
    "if we now consider neighboring layers with opposite spin , we put @xmath133 . at half filling , the lowest @xmath134 limiting the paramagnetic region is lower than the corresponding @xmath135 , independently of @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath119 , @xmath136 is always lower than @xmath137 for any @xmath116 , showing that , at half filling , we should expect antiferromagnetic ordering along the @xmath138-direction .",
    "the study above was focused on the second order instability lines , both in the case of collinear and spiral spin phases , being clear that spiral states have a lower critical @xmath139 value , over a large range electronic densities .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . looking at fig .",
    "2 of ref.@xcite we see that for the triangular lattice there are some finite regions where the more stable ground states correspond to spiral states .",
    "these regions are located at electronic densities smaller than 0.5 and larger than 0.8 .",
    "since the honeycomb lattice consists of two inter - penetrating triangular lattices we expect the same type behavior , at least at the qualitative level .",
    "that is , we do expect to have finite regions of the phase diagram where spiral phases have the lowest energy . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors do not discuss the full phase diagram of the hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice , as we do in next section .",
    "they are primarily interested in the stability of the nagaoka state .",
    "their study is done using three different approaches ( i ) the hartree single flip ansatz ; ( ii ) the ska gutwiller ansatz ; ( iii ) the basile - elser ansatz .",
    "a comparison can be established between the the hartree single flip ansatz which roughly speaking , produces a straight line for all densities at the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath140 , and our self consistent hartree - fock study . if we forget , for a moment , the van hove singularity , both results are qualitatively the same for @xmath1 up to 0.8 . above this value our hartree - fock analysis , forgetting about the existence of the antiferromagnetic phase , predicts a very strong increase of the critical @xmath0 value ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dcrit ] , since the af phase presents the lowest critical @xmath0-value ) , in agreement with the ska ansatz .",
    "this behavior is not captured by the the hartree single flip ansatz .",
    "it seems that our study interpolates between the hartree single flip ansatz for low densities and the ska ansatz for densities above 0.8 .",
    "quantitatively there are differences between the two studies , which are understandable on the basis of the different types of proposed ground states .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , the study of ref .",
    "@xcite is mainly concerned with the stability of the nagaoka state , and in the previous section we studied the values of the hubbard interaction associated with instabilities of the paramagnetic system .",
    "the transition from the paramagnetic to a magnetically ordered state is determined by the lowest @xmath76 .",
    "since we have found the possibility of having , at least , two ( ferro and antiferro ) different types of ground states , then in the case where interaction is stronger than both critical values , we need to address the problem of competition between the two ordered phases .",
    "the phase with the lowest free energy is the one prefered by the system . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the study of a single layer but we shall consider different band structures .",
    "spiral states will not be considered , since we are most interested in a weak ferromagnetic phase showing up in region of the phase diagram where the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the collinear ferromagnetic ( fully polarized ) phase should be the most stable one . in the ferromagnetic phase we distinguished two types of ferromagnetic ground states : the nagaoka ground state , with a maximally polarized spin ( @xmath141 ) , and a weak ferromagnetic state with @xmath142 .",
    "the order parameter and free energies were obtained from the mean field hamiltonian ( [ hamilthf ] ) .",
    "figure [ phase ] shows the ground - state @xmath143-phase - diagram of the model .",
    "the effect of @xmath33 on the phase diagram can be seen in right panel of fig .",
    "[ phase ] . in figure",
    "[ phase ] the dashed lines represent first - order phase transitions , where the order parameter do not vanish smoothly , while continuous lines represent second order transitions , where the order parameter vanishes smoothly , but its first derivative is discontinuous . in both cases ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) we find a finite region of weak ferromagnetism .",
    "in general the nagaoka phase is more stable for large @xmath0 .",
    "the weak ferromagnetic phase is separated from the nagaoka phase by first or second order transition lines , depending on the path followed on @xmath144 diagram .",
    "the second order transition manifests itself through a discontinuity of the derivative of the magnetization with respect to @xmath0 . at @xmath84",
    "the instability line towards the ferromagnetic phase shows a dip ( pronouced if @xmath46 ) , which is due to the logarithmic van - hove singularity at @xmath84 .",
    "a negative @xmath33 produces two effects on the phase diagram : ( i ) the instability line towards the @xmath145 phase moves downwards ; ( ii ) the point where the instability lines towards @xmath145 and @xmath146 meet moves to larger @xmath1 .",
    "similarly to what was found in the previous section , the overall effect of @xmath33 is to modify the ferromagnetic region of the phase diagram .",
    "further , for negative @xmath33 we expect collinear ferromagnetism to exist over a large phase of the phase diagram relatively to the case @xmath147 , since it is well known that a negative @xmath33 stabilizes the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "on the other hand we do nt expect the phase diagram presented in this section to be fully accurate for low densities , where the findings of ref .",
    "12 should apply .",
    "the first order critical lines do separate two different ferromagnetic ( or ferromagnetic from antiferromagnetic ) regions , in what concerns the total magnetization . in view of the results published in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a first order transition between the two competing phases is transformed by disorder into two second order phase transitions , we expect the same behavior to apply here , that is , disorder may change the order of the transition , since the arguments put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite are of very general nature",
    ". it would be very interesting to study whether the introduction of disorder in the system could change the nature of the first order transitions .",
    "this section is devoted to the calculation of quantum fluctuation corrections to the magnetization .",
    "an analogous calculation for the hubbard model in the square lattice in the @xmath148 limit was skecthed by singh and teanovi.@xcite    the computation of the renormalized staggered magnetization requires the evaluation of the feynman diagram shown in figure ( [ trovao ] ) , which shows the second order ( in the interaction @xmath0 ) contribution to the self - energy .",
    "the diagram describes the emission and later absorption of a spin wave by an up - spin electron .",

    "physically , this means that we shall calculate the magnetization renormalized by the spin waves . to this end , we start by replacing the susceptibility in equation ( [ selfenergy ] ) by the expression @xmath164 } { i\\omega - \\omega({\\bf q } ) } +   \\frac{r^{ij}[-\\omega({\\bf q})]}{i\\omega + \\omega({\\bf q})}\\ , , \\label{aldrabice}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 $ ] denotes the residue of @xmath166 at the spin wave pole with dispersion @xmath167 .",

    "figure [ magnetizations ] we show the renormalized magnetization versus @xmath0 .",
    "the hartree - fock magnetization is also shown in the figure [ magnetizations ] for comparison .",
    "the calculation was performed for three different lattice sizes .",
    "it can be seen that convergence does not require a very large number of @xmath170 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "this is not surprising because the hartree - fock magnetization itself already converges to the correct value in a 40@xmath17140 lattice .",
    "we have also checked that the rpa propagators return the original electron density @xmath119 , meaning that no spectral weight was lost in the used approximation for the self energy . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the renormalized magnetization saturates at about @xmath7 of the ( fully polarized ) mean field value .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the holstein - primakoff result for the @xmath71 heisenberg model in the honeycomb lattice , which predicts a ground state magnetization of @xmath8 .",
    "we should remark , however , that the spin wave spectrum calculated within rpa theory has shown much better agreement with experimental results for mott - hubbard antiferromagnetic insulators than the holstein - primakoff theory @xcite .    in figure [ img ]",
    "we show the imaginary part of the electron s green s function at negative frequencies , on both sublattices , for two different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that , for strong couplings , part of the hatree - fock spectral weight is shifted to the bottom of the ( negative ) energy band .",
    "this shifting of the spectral weight is responsible for the renormalization of the staggered magnetization .",
    "it is interesting to see that for low @xmath0 the spectral weight is most significant at high energy , in the interval [ -2,0 [ , with a much smaller weight in the interval ] -4,-2[. at a stronger hubbard interaction most of the high energy spectral weight ( previously in the interval [ -2,0 [ ) has been displaced to lower energies and become localized around well defined energies , whereas the spectral weight at intermediate energy ( in the interval ] -4,-2 [ ) remains essentially unchanged .",
    "therefore , increasing hubbard coupling has the efect of displacing the distribution of spectral weight from the top to the bottom of the energy band .",

    "in this paper we have studied the magnetic properties of the hubbard model in honeycomb layers .",
    "our study focused on the instabilities of the paramagnetic phase , on the magnetic phase diagram and on the collective excitations of the half filled phase .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that it is not possible to describe a true spiraling state in the honeycomb lattice , as opposed to the usual cubic case . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnetic spiral order follows a kind of one dimensional path over the 2d lattice .",
    "this kind of ordering , here studied at mean field level , may have important consequences to the study of spin charge separation in 2d lattices .",
    "also interesting , was the identification of two types of ferromagnetic order , which have eluded previous studies .",
    "for moderate values of @xmath0 and electron densities not far from the half filled case , a region of weak ferromagnetism was found to have lower energy than the more usual nagaoka ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the renormalization effect of the spin wave excitations on the hartree fock magnetization was also studied . however",
    ", our calculation does not take into account the renormalization of the mean field critical @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that quantum fluctuations should induce an increase the value of @xmath76 .",
    "our calculation can not capture this effect , since it only takes into account the effect of well defined spin waves .",
    "we believe , however , that the calculation can be extended to include the effect of high - energy damped particle - hole processes leading to a renormalization of @xmath76 , but this would require a modification of our numerical calculations and a significant increase of the computational time .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the equations for the critical lines from the static susceptibilities ( @xmath179 and @xmath81 ) .",
