    "the bounce characteristics of baseballs have a large influence in baseball games ; thus , baseball organizations often establish rules concerning official balls . for example , in major league baseball ( mlb ) , the baseballs are made by tightly winding yarn around a small core and covering it with two strips of white horsehide or cowhide@xcite .    for the estimation of the bounce characteristics ,",

    "because of the method of division of the pitching zone in the database that we used , the number of points was too scarce to identify a more detailed distribution . to obtain a more detailed distribution of the position of pitched balls , we can use more accurate data from pitchf / x@xcite .",

    "our model includes the lift coefficient @xmath66 as a fixed value , although @xmath64 can vary depending on the rotation of the ball@xcite .",
