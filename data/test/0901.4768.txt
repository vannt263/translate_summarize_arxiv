    "cooper pairs in superconducting nanostructures provide a potential source of entangled electrons @xcite , a possibility that has been recently explored in conventional superconductors both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in a typical experimental device , a superconducting region is contacted by several metallic electrodes at nanoscale distances with the aim of analyzing the non - local transport properties at subgap voltages . in the limit of vanishing contact transparency",
    "the non - local conductance is controlled by two type of processes yielding opposite contributions : direct elastic tunneling of electrons between two separate leads ( elastic cotunneling , ec ) and crossed andreev reflection ( car ) processes in which injected electrons from one lead are reflected as holes in the other lead ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the time reverse of these last processes involve entangled electron pairs on two separate leads @xcite . in conventional superconductors the average conductance tends to cancel due to the opposite contribution of ec and car processes @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to avoid a complete cancellation and have been invoked to explain the available experimental results . among them",
    "one can quote the use of ferromagnetic leads @xcite and the effect of electron - electron interactions in certain experimental geometries alfredo2007 . on the other hand",
    ", the magnitude of these non - local processes decays exponentially with the distance between the leads on a scale fixed by the superconducting coherence length @xmath1 in practice this means that non - local effects can be observed on distances of the order 10 nm to 1@xmath2 m , depending on the material @xcite .",
    "these effects have been much less explored in the case of unconventional high critical temperature superconductors ( htcs)byers1995,melin2003b , maekawa2006 .",
    "the characteristic small values of the coherence length in these systems cast doubts about the observability of non - local correlations .",
    "however , due to the anisotropy of the pair potential , the coherence length along certain directions can be much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "this anisotropy is behind the non - local nature of the electromagnetic response of htcs@xcite .",
    "in fact , some indirect evidence of car  processes in htcs coupled to ferromagnetic leads has been presented @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we analyze the non - local transport in @xmath0-wave superconductors and show that in contrast to the conventional @xmath4-wave case , car  processes are long ranged .",
    "moreover , we show that for certain orientations of the axes of the superconductor with respect to the contacts , car processes dominate over ec at low voltages and small contact transparency .",
    "we believe that these findings open the possibility of using htcs as a source of entangled electron pairs .",

    "an incoming electron from lead @xmath6 can be reflected in lead @xmath7 as : ( b ) an electron or , ( c ) a hole while a cooper pair is created in the superconductor . ]",
    "the situation to be analyzed is illustrated in fig .",

    "we consider a semi - infinite @xmath0-wave superconducting region connected to two normal leads , denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and separated a distance @xmath0 .",
    "our aim is finding the current induced on lead @xmath7 , @xmath9 , when a voltage @xmath10 is applied on lead @xmath6 .",
    "the two processes contributing to this current are depicted on panels ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "being the result of the diffraction of quasiparticles by an anisotropic pair potential , the relative weight of the two processes will be affected by the orientation of the superconductor symmetry axis ( angle @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , ec processes are favored for electron propagation along the nodal lines ( where the order parameter vanishes ) , while car processes reach a maximum amplitude along directions where the modulus of the pair potential is maximum .",
    "although on a spatial average the contribution of the two processes should be equal as in the case of isotropic s - wave superconductors , a dominance of one of the two can be found for specific orientations of the symmetry axis with respect to the leads .",
    "these qualitative arguments allow to understand the dominance of car over ec processes for the @xmath12 case ( @xmath13 symmetry ) and the opposite behavior in the case of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 symmetry ) as discussed in detail below .    in the spirit of the hamiltonian approach of ref .",
    "@xcite the differential conductance defined as @xmath16 , can be written as @xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the local density of states of the electron(hole ) in the lead @xmath19 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the corresponding hopping parameters coupling the superconductor to the leads .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the non - local propagators in the superconducting region ( indexes @xmath24 refer to electrons and holes in nambu space ) . the first term on the right hand size of eq .",
    "( [ cond_ab ] ) is due to car processes , while the second term corresponds to ec .",
    "therefore the crossed differential conductance is positive if car dominates over ec or negative in the opposite case . in order to make contact with possible experiments it also convenient to analyze the non - local resistance @xmath25 , given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the local conductances which can be obtained within the same formalism cuevas1996,melin2003a .",
    "the propagators @xmath28 of the coupled system are then given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the retarded green function of the uncoupled superconductor and @xmath31 .",
    "we have assumed that the densities of states of the normal metals are energy independent , i.e. @xmath32 . the symbol @xmath33 here denotes @xmath34 matrices defined in the electrodes @xmath35 nambu space , while we reserve the symbol @xmath36 for the reduced @xmath37 nambu space . to calculate @xmath38",
    "we first determine the superconductor surface green function in momentum representation , @xmath39 , using the asymptotic solutions of the bogoliubov de gennes equation herrera , which yields    @xmath40    where @xmath41 in the above equations @xmath42 is the pair potential which depends on the wave vector , taking the values @xmath43 and @xmath44 along the directions @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , where @xmath47 .",

    "one can check that in the case of s - symmetry for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 with @xmath58re@xmath59 and @xmath60 , a result which agrees with refs .",
    "therefore @xmath61 exhibits changes in sign on the @xmath62 scale and its spatial average is zero @xcite .",
    "we now consider the @xmath13 symmetry . due to the anisotropy of the pair potential an incoming electron from lead @xmath6",
    "is scattered as a quasiparticle in the superconductor , exploring regions where @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with an effective coherence length @xmath66re@xmath67 which takes values from @xmath3 to @xmath68 .",
    "for this reason one typically finds that the propagators exhibit a slower decay with distance than in the case of @xmath4-symmetry . in this paper",
    "we have fixed @xmath69mev @xcite and @xmath70 as typical values for htcs @xcite .",
    "we also take @xmath71 to simulate the effect of weak disorder @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dx2y2 ] illustrates the spatial dependence of the green functions . due to the dependence on @xmath72 of  the pair potential , it is not possible to obtain an analytical expression of their variation with @xmath0 as in the case of @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "however , from numerical regressions for @xmath56 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be fitted as     for @xmath63 symmetry at zero energy as a function of the separation between the leads .",

    "for low energies ( @xmath81 ) @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and therefore the propagator @xmath86 takes a much larger value than @xmath87 , yielding a clear dominance of car over ec in the tunnel limit . notice that the low energy excitations at @xmath88 give a negligible contribution to @xmath87 due to the weighting factor in eq .",

    "the local andreev reflection is zero because of diffraction of quasiparticles in the contact @xcite and the car contribution to @xmath98 is not zero , but is always smaller than the ec one , leading to a negative non - local conductance as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dxy ] .",
    "basically , the dominance of the ec contribution is caused by the suppression of the pair potential along the @xmath115 line .",
    "the effect of varying the contact transmission can be understood analytically within a similar approximation as done for the @xmath63 case , which allows to obtain the following expression for the crossed differential conductance    @xmath116    notice that car and ec contributions are equally affected by the coupling to the leads ( through the @xmath117-dependent common denominator ) and therefore ec dominates over car for the whole transmission range .",
    "the spatially averaged non - local conductance is negative and presents a zero bias peak that decreases with increasing transmission .",
    "in summary we have analyzed the behavior of the crossed differential conductance in @xmath0-wave superconductors in a multiterminal configuration .",
    "we have shown that correlations between different leads exhibit an algebraical decay instead of the exponential behavior which is typically found in conventional superconductors . in the case of @xmath13 orientation crossed andreev processes are favored at low voltages and contact transmissions , while for the @xmath15 case a zero bias non - local conductance peak appears , which is dominated by elastic - cotunneling . in both cases",
    "the spatially averaged non - local conductance is different from zero .",
