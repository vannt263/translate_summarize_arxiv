    "in the last year , two experiments provided the first observational evidence of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation : dasi @xcite achieved a direct measure of e  mode polarization ( see @xcite and @xcite for a definition of e and b modes ) , while wmap @xcite detected the cross ",
    "correlation between the cmb temperature anisotropies and e  mode polarization , giving an estimate of the reionization optical depth @xcite .",
    "a large number of experiments have been planned to measure the cmb polarization ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) , motivated by its huge information content .",
    "besides probing the ionization history , the cmb polarization can open a window on the primordial phase of the universe through the detection of the b ",
    "mode , i.e. the curl component of the polarization field .",
    "in fact , the b  mode polarization is generated by tensor metric perturbations and , in inflation models , its amplitude is directly proportional to the energy scale at which the inflation has occurred .",
    "however , the detection of this component is a real challenge , not only due to the very low level of the signal , but also to the presence of foregrounds and effects that can mix the e and b  modes of the cmb polarization .",
    "for example , the gravitational lensing produced by large scale structures converts a fraction of the cmb e ",
    "mode component to the b ",
    "although the effect is of a few percent or below , the lensing  induced curl mode can overwhelm the primordial one ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our knowledge of foreground polarization is still poor . among the galactic emissions which dominate foreground intensity fluctuations on large angular scales , free - free",
    "is nearly unpolarized while synchrotron is highly polarized ; its polarization properties have been studied at ghz frequencies ( @xcite , 2002 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but we have little or no direct information at frequencies of interest for cmb studies . at mm wavelengths , the galactic polarized signal is due essentially to the dust emission .",
    "estimates of this contribution have been so far provided only by models based on hi maps @xcite or on the starlight polarization @xcite , although direct sub - mm measurements over a substantial fraction of the sky have been recently provided by the archeops experiment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we deal with extragalactic radio sources , which are expected to be the dominant polarized foreground on small angular scales .",
    "accurate studies of their contribution to intensity fluctuations , based on evolutionary models fitting the available data at many frequencies , have been published . in our analysis",
    "we adopt the @xcite ( hereafter t98 ) model in order to predict the number counts of extragalactic radio sources at cm and mm wavelengths .",
    "this model reproduces very well the number counts of different classes of bright radio sources at ghz frequencies ( see sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] ) ; moreover , the accuracy of its high  frequencies predictions has been confirmed by the recent vsa ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , cbi @xcite and wmap @xcite surveys between 15 and 44ghz @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the wmap survey has detected 208 sources in a sky area of 10.38sr at @xmath4 at flux densities @xmath51.0jy .",
    "the t98 model predicts 270280 sources in the same sky area , so that the average offset is a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "moreover the distribution of spectral indexes in the wmap sample peaks around @xmath7 , which is exactly the mean spectral index for flat  spectrum sources adopted by t98 , and the fraction of steep  spectrum",
    "( i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) sources is of @xmath10 , to be compared with a predicted fraction of @xmath11 . as a curiosity",
    ", we also note that the brightest source detected by wmap has a flux density of @xmath12jy which corresponds exactly to the value for which the model predicts 1 source all over the sky .",
    "most of the available information on polarization properties of extragalactic sources refers to ghz frequencies , while for cmb studies we are interested in frequencies @xmath13ghz .",
    "there are at least two reasons to expect polarization properties to be frequency dependent , and , in particular , higher polarization at higher frequencies .",
    "first , at low frequencies substantial depolarization may be induced by faraday rotation .",
    "determinations of rotation measures for radio galaxies and quasars yield values from tens to @xmath14radm@xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , henceforth m02 ) , implying that depolarization may be significant up to @xmath16ghz .",
    "second , especially in compact objects , as the observing frequencies increase emitting regions are closer and closer to the nucleus , where the degree of the ordering of magnetic fields and , as a consequence , the polarization degree , may be higher and higher .    , of steep- ( upper data points ) and",
    "flat  spectrum ( lower data points ) nvss sources , compared with predictions of the t98 model ( steep  spectrum sources : short dashed curve ; flat  spectrum sources : dotted curve ; `` starburst '' galaxies : long dashed curve ) .",
    "the upper part of error bars for steep spectrum sources allows for the possibility that nvss sources missing a gb6 counterpart belong to this population .",
    "the dots show the total differential counts in terms of polarized flux . ,",
    "width=317 ]    preliminary estimates of the contribution of extragalactic radio sources to the polarization angular power spectrum ( aps ) were worked out by @xcite and m02 .",
    "@xcite simply scaled the temperature power spectrum by the mean squared polarization degree of radio sources , assuming a poisson spatial distribution .",
    "m02 , instead , computed the aps directly from the nvss polarimetric data @xcite , estimating a factor of 3 increase in the polarization degree of steep  spectrum sources from 1.4 ghz to @xmath17ghz and assuming that , for flat ",
    "spectrum sources , the polarization degree either is frequency independent or increases by a factor of 3 .    in this paper , we improve on previous estimates by studying the probability distribution of the polarization degree for both steep and flat  spectrum sources at @xmath18ghz , providing a recipe to extrapolate the distributions to higher frequencies .",
    "our results consist of a technique to generate simulated catalogues of extragalactic radio sources and also in accurate expressions to estimate the polarization aps , after having removed the strongest polarized sources .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) .",
    "this survey covers @xmath19sr of the sky with @xmath20 at 1.4 ghz , providing the flux density @xmath21 and the stokes parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 of almost @xmath0 discrete sources with @xmath24mjy .",
    "the images obtained from interferometric data have @xmath25fwhm resolution and the rms brightness fluctuation in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters is @xmath26mjybeam@xmath27 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     first of all , we check whether the polarization of a source at 1.4ghz is correlated to its value at higher frequencies . indeed ,",
    "the previously mentioned , frequency dependent effects ( faraday depolarization and the fact that at different frequencies we may effectively observe different emitting regions ) could spoil such correlation .",
    "if so , low - frequency data would not be representative of high frequency polarization properties .",
    "the pearson s linear correlation coefficient @xmath28 between the polarization at 1.4 and 4.8ghz of the sources in the mg+ and @xcite samples is @xmath29 corresponding to a probability of the null hypothesis , i.e. no  correlation , of @xmath30 .",
    "the correlation is less clear in the samples at higher frequencies ( @xmath31 and null  hypothesis probability of @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , these results are probably affected by the variability of sources , because we are comparing data taken at different epochs . on the contrary ,",
    "a strong correlation ( @xmath33 and null  hypothesis probability @xmath34 ) between 5 and 43ghz is found for the vla calibrators , whose polarization is measured simultaneously at all frequencies .",
    "consequently , the polarization degree of a source at frequency @xmath35 can be written in term of its value at 1.4ghz ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 where the factor @xmath38 is the increase of the polarization degree from the value at 1.4ghz .",
    "we find that @xmath38 itself is a function of the polarization degree at 1.4ghz : fig .",
    "[ f7 ] shows @xmath38 as function of @xmath36 for the sources in the mg+ and @xcite samples , while table [ t5 ] gives the average @xmath38 and its dispersion for different bins of @xmath36 . for sources with @xmath36",
    "above a few percent , @xmath39 is close to unity at all frequencies , but it can take very large values ( up to more than 10 ) if @xmath36 is very small .",
    "we can conclude that : @xmath40 the typical intrinsic polarization degree of flat  spectrum sources is of 25@xmath41 ; @xmath42 high values of the polarization degree are unlikely ( sources with @xmath43 are rare in the whole range of frequencies analysed ) , probably due to the low degree of the uniformity of magnetic fields in radio sources ; @xmath44 faraday depolarization is probably the cause of the large number of sources observed with very low polarization degree ( in fact , flat  spectrum sources with extreme values of rm have been observed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "finally , as already pointed out for @xmath45 , the behaviour of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is very similar , confirming that the polarization is weakly frequency dependent for @xmath48ghz . on the other hand , @xmath49 at mm wavelengths is higher than at ghz frequencies in all @xmath36 bins .    using mg+ and @xcite data",
    ", we get a simple analytical formula for the mean value of @xmath50 : @xmath51 where the frequency dependence appears only in the coefficient @xmath52 which takes the values 38 , 50 and 108 at @xmath534.8 , 10 and 273ghz respectively . using these three values",
    ", we obtain a law , @xmath54 , which allows us to compute @xmath55 at every frequency .",
    "the large dispersions around the mean values of @xmath38 are described by a fit similar to eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , obtained interpolating the values of the variance of @xmath38 in the @xmath36 bins : @xmath56 the factor @xmath57 is equal to 100 or 210 at @xmath534.8 or 10ghz , respectively , and it remains constant at higher frequencies ( we use a linear interpolation at @xmath58ghz ) .",
    "the above expressions for @xmath55 and for its variance are used to estimate the polarization degree distributions of flat  spectrum sources at every frequency in the range [ 5,300]ghz , starting from that of @xmath36 : the increase factor @xmath38 is modelled by a gaussian distribution which is cut at negative @xmath38 and whose mean value and variance are given by eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) . in figure [ f9 ]",
    "we give examples of the @xmath59 probability distributions between 1.4 and 100ghz , using a simulated sample of 1000 sources [ the probability distribution at 1.4ghz is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ] .",
    "the figure shows also the observed distributions at @xmath18ghz , scaled to the total number of simulated sources ; the good agreement between data and simulations is apparent .",
    "moreover , the k  s test finds high probabilities ( @xmath60 ) that the observed distributions are realizations of the probability distributions resulting from our simulations .",
    "a significant agreement is also found with the recent data at 18ghz by @xcite .",
    "finally , exploiting the t98 model , we generate simulations of the polarized intensity of the sky at 30 and 100ghz including radio sources and the cmb ( see figure [ f91 ] ) .",
    "we can directly compare the importance of the contribution of radio sources at the two frequencies : at 30ghz a lot of sources are evident in the map , superposed to the cmb signal , while at 100ghz their presence is far less conspicuous .",
    "distributions at several frequencies between 1.4 and 100ghz .",
    "the mean value of @xmath59 is also indicated .",
    "the solid line in the plot at 1.4ghz represents the first term of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "we report also the observed @xmath59 distributions , scaled to the number of simulated sources : 4.8ghz data refer to the mg+ ( dashed histogram ) and the @xcite ( dotted histogram ) samples ; 10ghz and at 15ghz data to the @xcite and @xcite samples respectively.,width=317 ]",
    "using the statistical characterization of the polarization degree described in the previous section , we are able to estimate the angular power spectrum ( aps ) of polarization fluctuations due to extragalactic radio sources .",
    "we adopt the t98 model in order to predict the source number counts at cm and mm wavelengths ( the model number counts are scaled by a factor 0.75 to be in agreement with the wmap data ) .",
    "we assume the spatial distribution of sources to be poissonian .",
    "the contribution of radio  source clustering to the power spectrum is , in fact , small and can be neglected if sources are not subtracted down to very low flux limits ( the clustering is noticeable only at relatively small fluxes , @xmath61mjy ; see t98 and @xcite ) .",
    "then the power spectrum is independent of the angular scale , and can be computed in the limit of small scales . under these conditions , we have @xmath62 @xcite . moreover , because point sources contribute , on average , equally to the @xmath63 , @xmath57mode and to @xmath22 , @xmath23 power spectra ( @xcite , m02 ) , @xmath64 ( in the following we refer to any of these spectra as the polarization aps ) .",
    "we estimate the point  source polarization aps in two ways : first as the product of the temperature power spectrum , @xmath65 , and the mean squared polarized intensity ; second , directly from the number counts of @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) . in both cases ,",
    "we exploit the @xmath59 probability distributions obtained in the previous section .",
    "@xcite have shown that the aps of intensity fluctuations produced by poisson  distributed sources can be written as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the total and the differential number of sources per steradian , and @xmath69 is the minimum flux density of sources that can be individually detected and removed .    in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) , the @xmath22 aps will be @xmath70 the stokes parameter @xmath22 can be written in terms of the polarization degree @xmath71 and of the polarization angle in the chosen reference system , @xmath72 , as @xmath73 . because we find @xmath21 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 to be independent variables in the nvss survey ( at least in the case of flat  spectrum sources ) , we obtain @xmath75 where the factor @xmath76 arises because of the uniform distribution of polarization angles .    at a frequency @xmath35 ,",
    "the mean squared value of the polarization degree , @xmath77 , is : @xmath78 where the probability distribution of @xmath79 at frequency @xmath35 , @xmath80 , is related to @xmath81 [ given in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ] : @xmath82\\pi_{1.4}^{0.35}|}\\ , .",

    "( [ e3 ] ) for the mean value of @xmath84 .",
    "for example , we find @xmath85 at 30ghz and @xmath86 at 100ghz .",
    "finally , it is easy to demonstrate that the cross - correlation @xmath87 spectrum is @xmath88 the previous method assumes that sources are removed from polarization maps using total intensity data .",
    "however , not all the experiments observing the sky polarization are able to measure the total intensity [ see , for example , the experiments : sport @xcite ; compass @xcite ; capmap @xcite ] . in this case",
    ", sources have to be detected and removed directly from @xmath22 and @xmath23 maps .",
    "therefore , we need to compute the @xmath22 aps using the differential sources counts @xmath89 , as in eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the lowest value of @xmath22 of sources that can be individually detected and removed from polarization maps . the counts @xmath89 can be obtained from the probability distribution of the three stokes parameters that describe the linear polarization , @xmath92 , as @xmath93 the probability @xmath92 is related to the probability distribution of @xmath21 , of the polarization degree @xmath94 and of the polarization angle @xmath95 , through @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the jacobian matrix of the transformation @xmath98 : @xmath99 as previously noted , the variables @xmath21 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 are independent , and therefore @xmath100 @xmath68 is provided by the t98 model and @xmath101 by eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) . finally :",
    "@xmath102 figure [ f10 ] shows our estimates of the polarization aps using the two methods discussed above , at the frequencies 30 , 44 , 70 and 100ghz . in each panel ,",
    "the two dotted curves are computed using eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) ( i.e. , the first method ) , and @xmath103jy ( upper line ) or the frequency dependent detection limit ( see caption ) obtained by @xcite for the planck mission using the spherical mexican hat wavelet to remove bright sources ( lower line ) .",
    "the latter limit , multiplied by @xmath104 , is used for @xmath91 ( and @xmath105 ) in eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) ( assuming that the source removal algorithm has a similar efficiency for polarization maps as for intensity ones ) .",
    "the factor @xmath104 arises if the noise in temperature and polarization are related by @xmath106 .",
    "the extrapolation of the polarization degree distribution at 1.4ghz to frequencies between 30 and 100ghz is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) and the mean value of @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the polarization aps due to the high  frequency extrapolation can be estimated by different realizations of @xmath59 distributions generated following the recipe we describe in section [ s4 ] .",
    "we find that the variance is small , a few percent of the average spectrum ( the number of sources is large enough to assure the sample variance to be negligible ) .    as discussed in section [ s4 ] , if the data of @xcite are disregarded , the polarization degree appears to be weakly dependent on the frequency for @xmath48ghz . assuming the @xmath59 distribution to be constant above 15ghz , the amplitude of the polarization aps decreases weakly with respect to previous estimates : @xmath107 at 30ghz and @xmath108 at 100ghz ( the differences are visibly appreciable only in the 100ghz panel of fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) .",
    "these latter estimates can be considered as lower limits and , together with the ones using the high  frequency extrapolation , provide us with two boundaries within which we expect to find the real polarization aps .",
    "we have verified that the results from the two methods agree when the bright source removal is equivalent . otherwise , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , estimates based on eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) are significantly lower than those using eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) : the difference is nearly a factor 10 if we take @xmath109 ( in the real case , however , we expect that @xmath110 , further increasing the difference ) .",
    "this is easily understood : adopting the limit on total flux density we are subtracting many more sources than we can do using only polarization maps .",
    "the previous estimates are obtained assuming that the polarization degree distribution for steep  spectrum sources is the same as for the flat  spectrum ones , although the results reported in table [ t4 ] and by m02 indicate that steep  spectrum sources are , on average , more polarized , at least at low frequencies . however , the contribution of steep  spectrum sources to the polarization aps is anyway very small at @xmath111ghz .",
    "the likely correction to our results at 30 ghz can be estimated as follows .",
    "the vsa survey at 15ghz @xcite finds a 25 percent of steep  spectrum sources for @xmath112mjy and a 44 percent for @xmath113mjy , corresponding to a contribution to @xmath65 of 30@xmath41 if @xmath114jy and of 43@xmath41 if @xmath115mjy ( we assume that the fraction of steep  spectrum sources increases to 75@xmath41 if @xmath116mjy ) . their contribution to the aps is reduced by a factor 3 at 30ghz if their average spectral index is @xmath117 between 15 and 30ghz ( a rather conservative assumption since the high frequency spectra steepen due to electron ageing effects ) . from the nvss catalogue we find that @xmath118 for steep  spectrum sources with @xmath119mjy .",
    "now , assuming that the polarization degree increases , on average , by a factor of 3 from 1.4ghz to high frequencies , we obtain that our estimates of the polarization aps by eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) must be multiplied at 30ghz by 1.3 or 1.4 in the case that @xmath114jy or 200mjy respectively ( dot  dashed lines in the 30ghz plot of figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to provide estimates of the contamination of cmb polarization maps by extragalactic radio sources .",
    "this task is particularly complicated because of the lack of polarimetric data at the frequencies where the cmb is observed .",
    "the richest data on the polarization properties of radio sources comes from the nvss survey , which provides a very large and complete catalogue of extragalactic sources at 1.4ghz . exploiting the spectral information obtained combining the nvss with the gb6 survey at 4.8ghz , we have analyzed the properties of steep and flat  spectrum sources .",
    "the former population shows an anti  correlation of the polarization degree with the flux density , already pointed out by m02 . on the contrary , for flat ",
    "spectrum sources the distributions of the polarization degree for different flux - density ranges do not show any significant variation and its mean value is constant and quite low , around @xmath120 .",
    "for this class of sources we find a fit that accurately describes the polarization degree distribution for all sources with @xmath121mjy .    exploiting the available data at @xmath122ghz",
    ", we have investigated how the polarization degree of sources varies with frequency .",
    "data on steep  spectrum sources , available only up to 15ghz , highlight a strong increase of the mean polarization degree with frequency , consistent with substantial faraday rotation measures . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean polarization degree of flat  spectrum sources shows only a weak increase between 1.4 and 15ghz , and appears to remain essentially constant at higher frequencies .",
    "however , the high values of the polarization degree found at mm wavelengths by @xcite may be an indication that new , more polarized , components show up there .    for flat  spectrum sources , we have derived an analytic function allowing us to extrapolate to any frequency the distribution of polarization degrees at 1.4ghz .",
    "we notice that only sources with @xmath123 increase significantly their polarization degree between 5 and 43ghz",
    ". these sources may be the only ones with really strong faraday depolarization at 1.4ghz .",
    "in general , at @xmath124ghz the polarization degree of flat  spectrum sources is typically of a few percent ( it rarely exceeds @xmath125 ) , and is weakly dependent on the frequency .    using this analytic function",
    ", we estimate the power spectrum of polarization fluctuations induced by extragalactic radio sources , by means of the two methods described in section [ s5 ] .",
    "in particular , we consider for the first time the case whereby the removal of the brightest sources can be only done using polarization data . in this case , the source subtraction is far less efficient than if total flux data can be used and , as a consequence , the amplitude of the source power spectrum can be up to a factor of 10 higher .",
    "total intensity data are , therefore , essential information in order to reduce the contamination of cmb polarization maps . in figure [ f10 ]",
    "we show the estimated contribution of undetected radio sources to the polarization signal observed by the dasi experiment at 30ghz : if indeed all the sources with the flux density higher than 50mjy have been removed , the residual contamination is extremely small .",
    "we have focused our analysis on flat ",
    "spectrum sources , since they are the dominant population at least up to 100ghz .",
    "spectrum sources are taken into account only at 30ghz , while they are disregarded at higher frequencies .",
    "about the gps sources , large uncertainties are still present on their abundance .",
    "the wmap data at 33ghz detected 16 sources with inverted spectra ( @xmath126 ) over a total of 155 sources with @xmath127jy .",
    "the multifrequency data summarized by @xcite indicate that most of them are likely to be blazars ( flat - spectrum quasars or bl lacs ) whose radio emission is dominated by a single emitting region ( a knot in the jet ) caught during a flare .",
    "thus , the surface density of bright gps sources peaking at high radio frequencies is likely to be several times lower than predicted by the @xcite models , even in the case of an intrinsic distribution of peak frequencies not extending above @xmath128ghz .",
    "according to the latter model ( which , in the light of wmap sources , provides rather generous upper limits ) , at @xmath129ghz , the contribution of gps sources to the total intensity aps is at the few percent level .",
    "furthermore , the polarization degree of bona - fide gps sources is very low at cm wavelengths .",
    "gps galaxies generally have fractional polarization below 0.3% ( many are undetected below 0.1% levels ) ; gps quasars have higher polarization than galaxies , but lower ( at 6 cm ) than non - gps quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the contribution of gps sources to the polarization aps is likely to be even lower than to the total intensity aps .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results on extragalactic radio sources with the e and b  mode spectra of the cmb radiation ( see figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "first of all , we notice that the cmb e ",
    "mode aps increases with @xmath130 in a similar way to the point  source spectrum in the range @xmath131 . at these angular scales ,",
    "radio sources yield a relevant contribution to the e - mode polarization only for @xmath132ghz ; in any case , also at these frequencies , they are not a serious problem for measurements of the cmb e ",
    "mode aps when the brightest sources are removed . at higher frequencies",
    "the cosmological signal is dominant at least up to @xmath133 or more .    on the other hand",
    ", extragalactic radio sources can be a critical factor for the detection of the cmb b  mode component :",
    "the cosmological @xmath134 is characterized by a peak at @xmath135 whose amplitude is directly related to the inflation model and , in particular , to the ratio between the amplitude of tensor and scalar perturbations .",
    "it is well known that an important limitation to the detectability of such peak comes from b  modes induced by gravitational lensing @xcite , especially on scales @xmath136 .",
    "however , our analysis highlights that , at least for @xmath137ghz , b ",
    "modes produced by extragalactic radio sources are even more critical",
    ". a better understanding of polarization properties of dust in the milky way and in external galaxies is necessary to establish whether frequencies higher than 100ghz may be more suitable to investigate the b  mode polarization .",

    "<S> the available high  frequency data are exploited to determine the frequency dependence of the distribution of polarization degrees . </S>",

    "<S> source polarization spectra are presented , extending and improving the one generally used in previous analyses . </S>",
