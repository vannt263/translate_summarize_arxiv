    "we described the large - scale environments of each pair by average large - scale density @xmath10 . for statistics we also included sfrs of galaxies and nuclear emission - line classification ( bpt ) of their sdss spectra .",

    "mean absolute _ r _  mag of neighbors is fainter by 0.9 mag than that of mrk galaxies .",

    "neighbor galaxies have the same distributions by ssfrs , bpt types and colors , and the same fraction of barred galaxies as mrk galaxies .",
    "this is a result of a correlation between properties of galaxies in pairs . however , because of magnitude limitation of markarian survey , mrk galaxies are usually the brightest members of pairs .       for galaxies with",

    ", there is a 0.7  dex increase of ssfrs from larger @xmath4 to smaller ones .",
    "however the variance of ssfrs because of morphologies is much larger ( more than 2.5  dex ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that pairs in denser environments have larger @xmath4 .",
    "because of morphology  density relation , @xmath4 is also biased by morphologies : early - type galaxies have about 3 times more @xmath4 than irregulars , so most of the ssfr vs. @xmath4 dependence is because of morphology  ssfr dependence and does not reflect pure interaction . therefore , it is essential to take into account morphologies of galaxies when discussing their ssfrs and interactions .",
    "grouping by morphologies weakens ssfr vs. @xmath4 relation , but there still remains some variance , maximal for early spirals ( @xmath11  dex ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with modeling , e.g. @xcite showing that strong starbursts during interactions are rare and that typical enhancement of sfr is less than 5 times .",

    "the major interactions are more effective in triggering sf than minor ones ( see fig .",
    "[ ssfrvsdpmajmin ] ) , there is a 0.5  dex increase of sf in major interactions , while there is no trend among minor interactions .",

    "* lambas et al . 2003 ) , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cox et al . 2008 ) ) suggesting that the merger mass ratio is an important parameter defining the effectiveness of the tidal forces .",

    "[ ssfrvsnmorph ] .",
    "earlier - type neighbors do not increase of ssfr , while the same- and later - type neighbors increase ssfr .",
    "the extra ssfr is maximal if the neighbor is of later morphological type ( 0.8  dex ) .",
    "previous papers , e.g. @xcite , also obtained similar result , supporting the scenario where neighbor of later type can not only trigger gas inflow in earlier type galaxy , but also be an additional source of gas fuel .",
    "the fraction of agn galaxies in less separated pairs is larger than that in more separated pairs .",
    "fraction of agns increases by about 7 times when going from unperturbed pairs ( @xmath13 ) to mergers ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this result indicates that while both agn and sf can be triggered by interactions , agns `` prefer '' stronger interactions .",
    "different timings of starbursts and agn events can explain this result ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the fraction of agns in major interactions is about 4 times larger than that in minor ones .",
    "we studied bpt  bpt correlations between pair members .",
    "there is a tendency to have an increased probability of a neighbor with the same bpt type .",
    "especially that is noticeable regarding passive galaxies and agns : passive galaxies are more likely to be found near another passive galaxy , agns are more probable to be near another agn .",
    "we explain these correlations between bpt types as a result of two main factors : first , the correlation between morphologies of galaxies , and , second , the increased likelihood of pair members to have nuclear activity of same types when interacting strongly .",
