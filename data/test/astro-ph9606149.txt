    "the explosion of sn 1987a ( shelton 1987 ) was one of the exciting historical astronomical events . the neutrino flux detected at the time of the explosion ( koshiba et al .",
    "1987 ) , and the observations of x- and soft @xmath2-rays ( sunyaev et al . 1987 ,",
    "dotani et al . 1987 ) constitute some of the `` first observations '' of such phenomena from supernovae confirming the general correctness of our theoretical understanding .",
    "in addition sn 1987a is classified as type ii , therefore a neutron star is expected at the center of this remnant .",
    "hard x - rays have been detected from sn 1987a with the kvant module on the russian mir station and with the japanese ginga satellite ( sunyaev et al .",
    "1987 ; dotani et al .",
    "the high - energy x - rays originate from the decay of @xmath3 , where the @xmath2-ray lines undergo multiple compton scatterings and are degraded into x - rays which , however , are absorbed through the tenuous cocoon of the stellar ejecta which is thick enough to block out soft x - rays from the compact object for quite a long time .",
    "the `` soft '' x  ray component originally observed with ginga below @xmath4 could not be confirmed by mir - ttm and mpe rocket observations ( aschenbach et al .",
    "1987 ) , nor by the rosat first - light observations ( trmper et al . , 1991 ) . since 1991 , however , the supernova is detected as a faint soft x - ray source ( beuermann et al .",
    ", 1994 ; gorenstein et al . ,",

    "we present data from continuous monitoring of sn 1987a with rosat .",

    "pspc source photons were accumulated in a circle around sn 1987a with radius 36 `` , while background photons were taken from an annulus with inner radius 36 '' and outer radius 82 \" .",
    "the pulse height distribution in the range 11 - 250 channels has been binned to a signal to noise ratio of 4 , yielding 318 net counts .",
    "various spectral models have been fit to the data , assuming a fixed line - of - sight absorption column density of @xmath12 ( gorenstein et al . ,",
    "the pspc response matrix is known to change as a function of time ( prieto et al . , 1996 ) , a fact which is taken care of by exsas using different instrument matrices for the beginning and the end of the pspc lifetime . since the pspc data covers a long period of time ( 1991 apr - 1993 sep ) the fits were performed with both response matrices in order to test for systematic errors , however no significant differences were found .",
    "table 2 gives an overview of the spectral fits .",
    "continuum spectra like a simple power law with photon index @xmath13 or thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath14 fit the data well .",
    "figure 2 shows the pspc pulse height spectrum with the corresponding thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the average 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity derived for the power law or bremsstrahlung fit is @xmath15 , assuming a distance of 51 kpc to the lmc .",
    "a single - temperature raymond - smith thermal plasma model ( rs ) , which is dominated by few emission lines , is rejected at a probability greater than 99% , even if the abundance is varied .",
    "this may indicate a more complicated ionization or temperature distribution .",
    "a two - temperature raymond - smith model is given for completeness , however , the errors are too large to draw firm conclusions .    in order to obtain a light curve of sn 1987a , separate images were produced for all time intervals in table 1 .",
    "source counts were extracted from a ring around the supernova with radius 24 `` for the hri and 40 '' for the pspc , respectively , containing roughly 90% of the hri ( david et al . , 1995 ) and about 95% of the pspc photons ( hasinger et al . , 1992 ) , respectively .",
    "background counts were extracted from an annulus around the source ring , having an outer radius of 82 \" .",
    "net source count rates were corrected for deadtime and the point - spread - function losses . in order to compare the hri and pspc count rates we computed the ratio of the count - to - flux conversion factors for both instruments , taking into account the selected pulse height channel range ( channel 52 - 201 for the pspc and channel 2 - 8 for the hri ) .",
    "assuming the first three spectral models in table 2 , the predicted count rate ratio factor varies between 2.46 and 2.89 .",
    "we therefore assumed a pspc / hri conversion factor of 2.65 .",
    "the final equivalent pspc count rates are given in table 1 .",
    "these count rates can be converted to 0.5 - 2 kev fluxes assuming a factor of @xmath16 pspc counts per @xmath17 .",
    "figure 3 shows the x - ray light curve of sn 1987a , clearly indicating a continuous flux increase during the interval 15003000 days after the explosion .",
    "we fitted the count rates with a power law model as a function of time and derive an exponent of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a linear increse starting on day @xmath20 can fit the data as well .",
    "using the foc aboard the hubble space telescope a faint circumstellar nebula has been observed around sn 1987a which has the shape of a thin ring with a radius of 0.2 pc and a thickness of only 0.02 pc ( jakobsen et al .",
    "the authors estimate a density of @xmath21 and a total mass of @xmath22 for the ring , which is thought to originate from a shock front in the progenitor wind at the interface between a slow , tenuous red supergiant wind ( rsw ) and a fast asymmetrical low  density blue supergiant wind ( bsw ) . in the meantime",
    "high quality images of the hubble space telescope show two fainter rings above and below the original ring nebula which probably mark the hour - glass shaped transition region between the bsg and the rsg winds , where a substantial density enhancement is expected to occur .",
    "the ring nebula is also observed to expand very slowly , presumably somewhat faster than the rsg wind speed ( plait et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "several investigators have discussed the x - ray emission of supernovae , in particular that of sn 1987 , in terms of thermal radiation of a reverse shock wave originating from the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the previously existing circumstellar material ( e.g. chevalier 1982 ) .",
    "the supernova blast wave is expected to interact with the wind , first with the bsg and later with the rsg wind , causing a shock wave to heat up the circumstellar material to x - ray temperatures .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the shock wave and its temporal behaviour depend on the density and gradient of the ambient medium . in the case of a freely expanding bsg wind with a density @xmath23 a decline of the x - ray luminosity as a function of time according to @xmath24",
    "is expected ( beuermann et al . , 1994 ; gorenstein et al . ,",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "have already remarked that the measured x - ray luminosity is too high for the simple free wind model .",
    "our current x - ray light curve is clearly inconsistent with the free wind model .    however , there are reasons to believe that a simple @xmath25 density dependence is not the correct description for the bsg wind of sn 1987a",
    ". as the existence of the ring nebula and the terminating discontinuity prove , the bsg wind must catch up and interact with the rsg wind and is therefore no longer freely expanding .",
    "several authors recently assumed the bsg wind matter to be homogeneously distributed within the radius of the ring nebula ( suzuki et al .",
    ", 1993 ; masai and nomoto ; 1994 ; luo et al . , 1994 ) . in this case",
    "a steadily increasing x - ray luminosity is predicted in the bsg wind interaction phase , with a time dependence proportional to @xmath26 , which is consistent with our findings ( see fig .",
    "chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) propose that the supernova shock is now interacting with an @xmath27 region created by the bsg star in the swept - up rsg wind .",
    "they predict a slow rise of the x - ray flux , which , however should start only around day @xmath28 .",
    "our supernova x - ray light curve is consistent with this model , too .",
    "masai & nomoto ( 1994 ) present detailed hydrodynamical calculations and predict a dramatic increase in x - ray luminosity around the time when the stellar ejecta hit the dense ring nebula . because the sn blast wave is slowed down by the shock interaction ,",
    "the impact time depends on the density of the ambient medium according to @xmath29 .",
    "different authors assume substantially different values for this density , ranging from @xmath30 ( luo et al . , 1994 ; masai & nomoto , 1994 ) to @xmath31 in the equatorial plane ( chevalier & dwarkadas , 1995 ) . correspondingly , the range of predicted impact dates is still considerable ( roughly 1996  2008 ) .",
    "the new rosat determination of the x - ray lightcurve of sn 1987a now allows to put further constraints on the density in the circumstellar material . the total x - ray flux measured on day 3000 ( see fig . 3 and tab .",
    "1 ) corresponds to a 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath32 .",
    "depending on the assumed spectral model , the energy band correction factor is quite uncertain . assuming a correction factor of 3 for a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum we estimate a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath33 .",
    "if we interpret this as coming from the sn blast wave in the context of the masai & nomoto ( 1994 ) model , we can estimate the density of the bsg wind to @xmath34 from their equation ( 7 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the impact time of the sn blast wave at the location of the ring nebula would be @xmath35 after the explosion , i.e. in the year ad 2003 .",
    "we have to caution , however , that we find significantly lower temperatures than predicted by masai & nomoto . a factor of @xmath36 higher density and ,",
    "correspondingly , a later impact time has been proposed by chevalier and dwarkadas ( 1995 ) . in view of the rather complicated situation",
    "these predictions are still quite uncertain",
    ".    there could be other contributions to the observed x - ray emission of sn 1987a , in particular radiation from the surface or the magnetosphere of a putative neutron star . actually , the currently observed x - ray luminosity and temperature are comparable to the values expected from the thermal surface radiation of a young neutron star .",
    "however , the circumstellar cocoon of matter is expected to block out all but the highest energy x - rays of the neutron star for a long time . under relatively optimistic assumptions ,",
    "kumagai et al . ( 1993 ) predict a possible pulsar to be seen after @xmath37 only at energies above 6 kev .",
    "nevertheless , relatively little is known about the clumpiness of the absorber and thus the observed increase of x - ray flux could still be associated to radiation from a compact object .",
    "the long - term x - ray lightcurve of sn 1987a can likely discriminate between the different possibilities . continuing x",
    " ray observations of sn 1987a are therefore highly desirable , in particular since at any rate a major brightening is expected in the coming years .",
    "we would like to thank k. beuermann , r. mccray , k. masai , k. nomoto and h. gelman for important communications .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
