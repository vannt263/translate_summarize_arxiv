    "bl lacertae ( bl lac ) is the prototype of bl lac objects(bl lacs ) . in the unified scheme of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ,",
    "bl lacs and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are usually collectively termed as blazars .",
    "bl lacs are characterized by non - thermal continuum emission across the whole electromagnetic spectrum with absent or weak emission and absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , variable and high polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , large amplitude and rapid variability at all wavelengths from radio to @xmath0-rays ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and superluminal motion of radio components ( e.g. denn , mutel & marscher 2000 ) .",
    "bl lac is a well - studied source that has been monitored in optical band for more than a century .",
    "variability on both long and short timescales has been observed by many authors ( villata et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "microvariability has been detected since the early work by racine @xcite .",
    "intranight optical variability ( inov ) of this object was studied in detail during the long 1997 outburst .",
    "nesci et al .",
    "@xcite reported multi - band inov based on the observations made in july 1997 .",
    "the source was never found to be stable during their campaign .",
    "they found that the amplitude of flux variation was always larger at shorter wavelengths and no apparent time lags among the light curves in different wavebands could be detected .",
    "speziali & natali @xcite monitored bl lac in three optical bands on three nights in august 1997 .",
    "their results involved inov on timescale ranging from 30 minutes up to 3.5 hours .",
    "they concluded that the magnitude of variability was larger at shorter wavelengths and the source showed a marked trend to become bluer when brighter .",
    "this chromatism of inov was confirmed by many other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "papadakis et al @xcite analyzed the inov , the timescales of rising and decaying processes , and the time lags between different optical bands .",
    "their results showed that the variability amplitudes increased with increasing frequency .",
    "the rising and decaying timescales were comparable within each band , but increased with decreasing frequency .",
    "the time lag between the light curves in bands _",
    "b _ and _ i _ was less than @xmath10.4 hours .",
    "they also detected significant spectral variations , which had the trend to become harder ( bluer ) as the flux increased .    in order to investigate the details of the physical processes and geometric conditions based on the brightness and spectral variability ,",
    "bl lac has been intensively monitored in four campaigns ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; villata et al .",
    "@xcite ; villata et al .",
    "@xcite ) by the whole earth blazar telescope ( webt ) collaboration since 1999 to 2003 . most of these optical multi - band data were collected and analyzed by villata et al .",
    "their results from the analysis of colour index revealed that the variability had two components , long term ( a few - day timescale ) `` mildly - chromatic '' variations and strong bluer - when - brighter chromatic short term variations ( intraday flares ) .",
    "stalin et al .",
    "@xcite showed that bl lac became bluer when brighter on intranight timescale , while this trend was less significant on internight timescale .",
    "their results may also suggest that the variability of bl lac has two components .",
    "they found that the dependence of the spectral variability on its brightness was different from that of s5 0716 + 714 . on the contrary",
    ", some objects were reported to become redder when brighter .",
    "for example , ramirez et al @xcite presented that the spectrum of pks 0736 + 017 became redder when brighter on both internight and intranight timescales .",
    "this different property may be introduced by different physical processes or physical environments .    to shed more light on the inov and spectral variation with respect to flux variation on both internight and intranight timescales",
    ", we carried out dense observations on bl lac .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction in the following section . sect .",
    "3 gives the results of our observations .",
    "a summary is presented in sect .",
    "our observations were carried out with a 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope , which is located at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories of china .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a 15-colour intermediate - band photometric system , covering a wavelength range of 300010000  .",
    "a ford aerospace @xmath2 ccd camera is mounted at its main focus .",
    "the ccd has a pixel size of 15 microns and its field of view is @xmath3 , resulting in a resolution of 1.7/pixel .",
    "the telescope and the photometric system are mainly used to carry out the batc survey @xcite .",
    "we performed optical observations in the batc _ e _ , _ i _ and _ m _ bands in a cyclic mode .",
    "their central wavelengths are 4885 , 6685 and 8013  , respectively . for good compromise between photometric precision and temporal resolution ,",
    "the exposure times were 150 seconds in the batc _",
    "i _ band and mostly 240 seconds in the _ e _ and _ m _ bands . because a frame size of @xmath4 pixels ( @xmath5 ) is large enough to cover bl lac and its comparison stars , we only read out the central @xmath4 pixels of the ccd images .",
    "the readout time is about 5.6 seconds .",
    "so we can achieve a temporal resolution of about 12 minutes in each band .",
    "this quasi - simultaneous measurements enable us to investigate the colour variation .",
    "bl lac was observed on 26 nights during the period from july 5 , 2005 to november 18 , 2005 .",
    "all images were processed with the automatic data reduction procedure including bias subtraction , flat fielding , position calibration , aperture photometry and flux calibration .",
    "the adopted aperture radius was 4 pixels ( 6.8 ) , since the average fwhm of the object and the comparison stars was 3.5 .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the sky annulus were set as 6 and 9 pixels ( 10.2and 15.3 ) , respectively .",
    "the comparison stars b , c and h from smith et al .",
    "@xcite were used for flux calibration .",
    "their batc magnitudes were obtained by observing them and three batc standard stars , hd  19445 , hd  84937 and bd+17d4708 , on a photometric night .",
    "they were listed in table  [ batcstd ] .",
    "the star i d is followed by its batc _ e _ , _ i _ , _ m _ magnitudes and errors in table  [ batcstd ] . the batc magnitudes of bl lac can be obtained by differential photometry .",
    "the batc magnitudes can also be transferred to standard johnson - cousins magnitudes by the relations obtained by zhou et al . @xcite .",

    "we took @xmath13 to denote the brightness of the source . in our analysis ,",
    "the contribution of the host galaxy was not subtracted from the total flux densities .",

    "[ color ] .",
    "d. it suggests that the spectral variability of the intranight fast flares and internight variability may be different . to decompose the intranight variation from the internight variation",
    ", we used the faintest magnitudes in bands _",
    "e _ and _ m _ on each observation night to indicate the internight long term variation",

    "the linear correlations are all significant at a 0.95 confidence level , while the slope of fast flares ( @xmath15 ) is larger than that of internight variations ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "so the spectral variability reveals that the variability has `` strongly chromatic '' intranight fast flares and `` mildly chromatic '' internight variations .",
    "our result is consistent with that of villata et al . @xcite .",
    "the slopes in this work are larger than the slopes by villata et al .",
    "@xcite , since the considered frequency separation in this work is larger than that in villata et al . @xcite .",
    "we monitored bl lac with a high temporal resolution with batc telescope during the period from july 5 , 2005 to november 18 , 2005 .",
    "many fast variations superposed on the long term trend were recorded .",
    "the rising phase of the second flare lasted at least 44 days . during this rising process , the variability amplitudes are 1.374 , 1.252 and 1.174 mag in band _",
    ", _ i _ and _ m _ , respectively .",
    "799 optical multi - band observations and 258 colour indices were obtained . by analyzing the inov",
    ", we conclude that for the intranight variability , the amplitude of variability is larger at the shorter wavelength , the variation rate is also larger at shorter wavelength and it is comparable in the rising and decaying phases within each band .",
    "an average time lag between bands _",
    "e _ and _ m _ was obtained by the method of zdcf .",
    "it must be treated with caution , because it is close to the temporal resolution of our observations .",
    "different variation rates in different bands and the time lag will lead to spectrum variations .",
    "the variability of bl lac can be interpreted as having two components by the analysis of spectral variability with the brightness : a `` strongly - chromatic '' intranight component and a `` mildly - chromatic '' internight component .",
    "our results confirmed the conclusions about the components of the variability from villata et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the generally accepted scenario , the non - thermal emission from bl lacs includes low frequency synchrotron radiation and high frequency inverse - compton radiation , which are produced by relativistic electrons in a jet oriented at a small angle to the line of sight .",
    "the jet is powered and accelerated by a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the details are still under debate , this scenario can well explain most of the observation properties of bl lacs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of `` strongly - chromatic '' intranight variability and `` mildly - chromatic '' internight variability is possible induced by both intrinsic mechanisms and geometrical effects .",
    "the `` mildly - chromatic '' component can be interpreted by the variation of doppler factor on a spectrum slightly deviating from a power law ( villata et al .",
    "the direction of the jet varies as the knots move relativistically on helical trajectories within an small angle with respect to the observer .",
    "the internight variations can be introduced by the variation of the direction of jet adding the spectrum slightly deviating from the power law .",
    "the `` strongly - chromatic '' component can be explained by particle acceleration and propagation by shock - in - jet events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the particles are accelerated by the shocks advancing down the jet , the optical synchrotron emission is enhanced due to the accelerated particles and the over - dense magnetic field .",
    "this kind of shock - in - jet model will lead to a bluer - when - brighter phenomenon @xcite , which is the same as the spectral variability in this paper .",
    "the intranight component can also be explained by a simple model representing the variability of a synchrotron component @xcite .",
    "so the variability of bl lac may be the results of both intrinsic mechanisms and geometric effects .",
