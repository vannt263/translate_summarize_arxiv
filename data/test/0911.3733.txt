    "actinide dioxides ( ano@xmath0 ) have been attracted lots of attention due to their rich physical phenomena characterized by the complex nature of 5__f _ _ electrons .",
    "many experimental and theoretical works have been devoted to investigating the thermodynamical , electronic structural , and defect properties of ano@xmath0 systems .",
    "taking uo@xmath0 and puo@xmath0 for example , their insulating ground states have been established experimentally @xcite and successfully predicted theoretically @xcite . when referring to insulators or semiconductors , one basic physical quantity of interest is their band gaps .",
    "if the band gap of uo@xmath0 or puo@xmath0 can be comparable to semiconductors , one idea may occur to us that whether they can be applied extensively in the electronic and optoelectronic devices like semiconductors ( si , gaas , and zno ) or not . recently , meek _ et al .",
    "_ discussed the electronic properties of uranium dioxide and revealed the potential performance advantages of uranium dioxide as compared to conventional semiconductor materials @xcite . especially , the higher dielectric constant of uo@xmath0 makes it more suitable for making integrated circuits @xcite .",
    "this may stimulate many studies of the optical properties for actinide dioxides in future .",
    "optical adsorption and reflectance spectra of semiconductors have been studied for several decades both experimentally and theoretically , whereas , similar works performed on actinide dioxides is still very scarce although they are necessary not only from the viewpoint of basic science but also from their technological importance in industries .",
    "experimentally , schoenes studied the incidence reflectivity of uo@xmath0 single crystals in the photon energy range of 0.03 - 13 ev , from which the complex dielectric function @xmath1 has been derived @xcite . for puo@xmath0 , to our knowledge ,",
    "no experimental optical data are available in literature . as for the theoretical investigations of optical spectrum of actinide dioxides , it is a great challenge to standard density functional theory that an accurate description of electronic structure for actinide oxides is hard to be achieved , which is indispensable to getting the correct optical spectrum .",
    "conventional density functional schemes that apply the local density approximation ( lda ) or the gga underestimate the strong on - site coulomb repulsion of the 5@xmath2 electrons and consequently fail to capture the correlation - driven localization .",
    "therefore , the 5@xmath2 electrons in actinide oxides require special attention .",
    "one promising way to improve contemporary lda and gga approaches is to modify the intra - atomic coulomb interaction through the so - called lda+@xmath3 or gga+@xmath3 approach , in which the underestimation of the intraband coulomb interaction is corrected by the hubbard @xmath3 parameter @xcite .",
    "recently , the electronic structures of uo@xmath0 and puo@xmath0 are correctly reproduced using lda+__u _ _ or gga+__u _ _ calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , based on the good performance of lda / gga+__u _ _ approaches in describing the electronic structure of the systems containing 5__f _ _ electrons , it is encouraging to investigate the optical spectra of them .    in this work",
    ", we used the gga+__u _ _ scheme to study the static and frequency - dependent dynamical dielectric response functions for uo@xmath0 and puo@xmath0 .",
    "our present calculated band gap @xmath4 and high - frequency dielectric constant @xmath5 for uo@xmath0 are 2.3 ev and 5.53 , which are in good agrement with the experimental values of about 2.1 ev and 5.1 observed in the optical spectra @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , our calculated dielectric function @xmath6 exhibits the overall agreement with experimental result and the main peaks are well reproduced . the dielectric function and the consequent optical spectra for puo@xmath0",
    "are also calculated in the paper .",
    "in particular , the value of @xmath7 for puo@xmath0 is predicted to be 6.21 , a little larger than that for uo@xmath0 .",
    "considering the satisfactory calculations for uo@xmath8 , we expect our predicted optical behavior for puo@xmath0 can provide a useful reference for future experimental measurement .",
    "our electronic structural and optical calculations are performed using the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method of blchl @xcite , as implemented in the ab initio total - energy and molecular - dynamics program vasp ( vienna _ ab initio _ simulation program ) @xcite .",
    "paw is an all - electron method that combines the accuracy of augmented - plane - wave methods with the efficiency of the pseudopotential approach .",

    "the electron wave function is expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 500 ev . for the brillouin zone integration",
    ", the @xmath9 centered 6@xmath106@xmath106 grid is adopted .",
    "144 bands are used to get the dynamical dielectric function @xmath6 and a good convergence can be achieved . in order to perform the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase calculations , we used the unit cell containing 12 atoms . the strong on - site coulomb repulsion among the localized 5__f _ _",

    "one method is using a summation over conduction band states and the other is using the linear response theory ( density functional theory ) . for the latter ,",
