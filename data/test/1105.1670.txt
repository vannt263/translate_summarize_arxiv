    "the development of the phase - field method has led to tremendous progress in the modelling of pattern formation during solidification , due to its capability to simulate complex time - dependent and three - dimensional morphologies with relatively simple numerical codes @xcite .",
    "the general principle of this method is to describe a multi - phase system by a set of phase fields which take constant values in each of the bulk phases and vary smoothly through interfaces of a characteristic thickness @xmath0 .",
    "the equations of motion for the phase fields and their coupling to the local thermodynamic state variables ( temperature , density , composition etc . ) can be obtained , following the basic principles of out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics , by taking a variational derivative of a free energy functional , which is generally of the ginzburg - landau type .",
    "mean - field approximations can be used to relate the parameters that appear in this functional to microscopic quantities , and the phase fields can often be interpreted as order parameters .    generally , the equations that result from the straightforward application of these principles are not suitable for obtaining quantitatively accurate simulation results on solidification microstructures .",
    "the reason is that the characteristic natural thickness of the diffuse solid - liquid interfaces is a few times the interatomic distance , whereas solidification patterns typically exhibit length scales ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xmath3 m .",
    "even with the help of modern computers and multi - scale algorithms , both of these scales can not be resolved at the same time .",
    "therefore , in order to simulate solidification microstructures , the thickness of the diffuse interfaces in the phase - field model has to be artificially enlarged , sometimes by two or three orders of magnitude .",
    "quantitative results can only be expected if both the equilibrium and kinetic properties of the interfaces remain unchanged under this procedure .    to achieve this goal ,",
    "it is helpful to adopt a phenomenological point of view : the phase field is seen as a smoothed indicator function ( as opposed to a physical order parameter or density ) , and all equilibrium quantities and transport coefficients are interpolated between the phases with smooth functions of the phase fields that can be freely chosen .",
    "this freedom can be exploited to construct phase - field models with special properties .",
    "in particular , rescaling of the interface thickness is greatly simplified in models where bulk thermodynamics and interfacial properties can be controlled separately .",
    "the phase - field models for the solidification of a pure substance published in the literature are all quite similar @xcite , in the sense that they use the same set of fundamental fields ( a phase field and the temperature field ) , and that the structure of the equations is the same .",
    "one reason for this universality is that a simple and intuitive formulation of the model in terms of these fields yields indeed , as will be detailed below , a model in which this separation is achieved . therefore , the development of the `` thin interface limit '' @xcite which has paved the way to quantitative simulations of dendrites @xcite did not require a change in the model formulation .",
    "the situation is more complicated for alloy phase - field models .",
    "two different approaches with quite distinct philosophies have been pursued in parallel .",
    "the first , which will be called the `` coarse - graining '' approach in the following , generalizes the pure substance model by introducing a concentration field in addition to the temperature field and by writing down a free energy functional that depends on the phase field , the temperature , and the concentration @xcite .",
    "the local values of these three fields are  in principle  the coarse - grained counterparts of the microscopic structural order parameter , temperature , and concentration fields , and the interface is seen as a narrow region in space where all of these quantities can exhibit rapid spatial variations .",
    "in contrast , the second approach , called `` two - phase '' approach in the following , treats the interfaces as a mixture of two phases , each of which retains its bulk properties even inside the interface @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the phase field represents the volume fraction of one of the phases .",
    "moreover , a separate concentration field is defined for each phase , and the physical concentration field is obtained by a weighted average depending on the value of the phase field .",
    "the introduction of two separate concentration fields adds a supplementary degree of freedom which has to be removed from the problem ; this is done either by a specific partition relation @xcite or by the condition of local equilibrium between the coexisting phases @xcite .    in the models of the `` coarse - graining '' type",
    ", the model structure generally leads to an intrinsic coupling between bulk and interface properties , which makes simulation results dependent on the chosen interface thickness . only for the case of dilute binary alloys ,",
    "a specific interpolation of the thermodynamic properties through the interface has been developed @xcite which overcomes this constraint and makes quantitative simulations possible . in the two - phase approach , which is more phenomonological from the outset , bulk and interfacial properties",
    "are decoupled by construction .",
    "however , the removal of the extra degree of freedom introduced by the model formulation generally requires the solution of a nonlinear equation in each point of the interface , and thus adds significant computational complexity .    the purpose of the present paper is to show that the coarse - graining approach can be easily extended to more complex alloy systems if instead of a free energy functional a grand - potential functional is used to generate the equations of motion .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of the resulting model shows that it is in fact perfectly equivalent to the two - phase model , which offers the possibility to reinterpret and simplify the latter .",
    "the fundamentals underlying these findings can be stated quite simply .",
    "the motion of interfaces is controlled by the transport of a conserved extensive quantity : energy for a pure substance , and chemical species for isothermal alloy solidification . in sharp - interface models ,",
    "this fact is expressed by two separate laws : a transport equation in the volume and a conservation law of stefan type at the moving boundary .",
    "in contrast , the two - phase equilibrium at interfaces is controlled by the intensive quantity that is conjugate to the conserved one : temperature for pure substances and chemical potential for alloys .",
    "it turns out that the pure substance model has been formulated from the start in terms of a phase field and the intensive variable ( temperature ) , whereas alloy phase field models are traditionally formulated in terms of a phase field and the composition , which is a density of the extensive variable ( number of solute atoms ) . to obtain a model for alloys that has properties analogous to those of the pure substance model , it is sufficient to choose a formulation in terms of a phase field and the chemical potential , and to switch to the appropriate thermodynamic potential , which is the grand potential",
    "of course , the fact that the quantity analogous to the temperature is the chemical potential is well known @xcite and has been extensively used in sharp - interface models as well as in a few specific phase - field models @xcite , but its general consequences have so far not been fully appreciated in the framework of phase - field models .    it should be mentioned that a second obstacle for obtaining quantitative results on alloys is the strong contrast of the solute diffusivities between solid and liquid , which generates spurious solute trapping when the interface thickness is scaled up .",
    "this problem was solved by the so - called antitrapping current , which was introduced first in the coarse - graining approach @xcite , but has also been incorporated in the two - phase model @xcite . since the results of the present paper do not introduce major changes on this point , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite will be taken over without a detailed discussion .",
    "after a change of variables , the model is almost identical to the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , such that the asymptotic analysis developed there remains valid .",
    "this will be illustrated by numerical simulations that explicitly test the independence of simulation results of the interface thickness for the case of a lens - shaped phase diagram .",

    "[ sec_pure ] , the standard phase - field model for the solidification of pure substances is reviewd for reference .",

    "the minimal model of solidification is considered , which implies some standard simplifications : the densities of the solid and the liquid are taken to be equal , and heat transport is assumed to take place by diffusion only . as a consequence , no motion of matter needs to be considered , and the only transported extensive quantity is heat .    under these assumptions , the state of an inhomogeneous two - phase system can be completely specified on a coarse - grained ( mesoscopic ) scale by two fields : a phase field @xmath4 which indicates the local state ( liquid or solid ) of matter , and the internal energy density @xmath5 .",

    "if @xmath5 is chosen as dynamic variable , the corresponding thermodynamic potential is the entropy .",
    "consequently , the system is naturally described by an entropy functional [ , e ] = _ v s(,,e , e ) where the local entropy density @xmath9 depends on the fields as well as their gradients . using the thermodynamic definition of the temperature , = ,",

    "simulations are almost always carried out with models formulated in the variables @xmath4 and @xmath8 that can be obtained from free energy functionals .",
    "besides historical reasons ( the first phase - field models for solidification were formulated in this language @xcite ) , there are also formal considerations which make this approach preferrable .",
    "the main reason to choose the intensive variable @xmath8 instead of the extensive variable @xmath5 is that it directly controls the two - phase equilibrium , which makes it easier and more intuitive to identify the driving forces in the model .",
    "this point will be illustrated by obtaining the equations of motion from a free energy functional that is constructed using a purely phenomenological point of view .",
    "it will be shown below that the standard phase - field model of solidification is easily obtained as a special case .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the free energy densities of pure solid and liquid , respectively , and let the corresponding equilibrium values of the phase field be @xmath13 .",

    "the motivations for this formulation are easily understood and are common to many phase - field models .",
    "the term @xmath20 creates domains where the phase field is close to its equilibrium values @xmath13 ( the minima of the double - well function ) , separated by diffuse interfaces .",
    "therefore , far from the interfaces , the free energy density reduces to the one of the corresponding bulk phase .",
    "the term @xmath20 contributes to the free energy only inside the interfaces ; this excess free energy represents the surface tension . the function @xmath14 interpolates between the two free energy densities through the diffuse interface .",

    "the variation of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath4 is the driving force for the phase transition .",
    "two features are noteworthy : ( i ) the requirement that @xmath17 ensures that the driving force vanishes outside of the interfacial regions , and ( ii ) since , at the melting temperature @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the `` thermodynamical '' part of the driving force is identically zero , independently of the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the latter property implies that the equilibrium interface profile in @xmath4 can be calculated from the term @xmath20 alone .",

    "the most important conclusions of the present work can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "a phase - field model for alloy solidification has been obtained in a completely variational framework , starting from a phenomenological grand - potential functional that is a simple sum of bulk and interface contributions . in this model ,",
    "the two dynamic variables are the phase field and the chemical potential field .",
    "a complete analogy can be established with the standard phase - field model for the solidification of a pure substance , in which the variables are the phase field and the temperature field .",
    "the main difference between the two sets of equations is that the relation between the composition and the chemical potential ( the extensive and the intensive variable ) is nonlinear , whereas the relation between temperature and internal energy is usually assumed to be linear .",
    "the resulting model is shown to be completely equivalent to the model of kim , kim and suzuki @xcite , with the chemical potential replacing the composition as the dynamic field . as a result , in the present model no `` partitioning '' of the solute into coexisting phases is necessary ; the ( auxiliary ) compositions in each of the phases can be simply obtained from the chemical potential . with an additional change of variables ,",
    "the phenomenological access model @xcite can also be recovered and extended to general alloy phase diagrams .",
    "these developments show that these two - phase models , despite a seemingly quite different starting point , can in fact also be obtained by a coarse - graining procedure if the appropriate thermodynamic potential is used .",
    "3 .   the equations of the new model can also be written in terms of a phase field and the composition field .",
    "they thus have essentially the same computational complexity as the original phase - field models for alloy solidification @xcite derived in the coarse - graining framework .",
    "however , in contrast to the latter models , they have a decisive property which is required for quantitative simulations : bulk and interface thermodynamic properties can be adjusted independently .",
    "this difference in behavior is due to the different interpolations of the relevant thermodynamic potentials ( free energies in refs .",
    "@xcite , grand potentials here ) .",
    "4 .   with an additional approximation  a linearization of the relation between chemical potential and composition inside the interfaces ",
    "the model becomes equivalent to the quantitative dilute alloy model studied in refs .",
    "this feature makes it possible to include the additional antitrapping current as in that model , and to apply the detailed asymptotic analysis of ref .  @xcite . as demonstrated for one particular case here ,",
    "efficient and accurate simulations are thus possible for arbitrary alloy phase diagrams .",
    "numerous interesting perpectives for future work arise from the present results .",
    "first , the model has been worked out here for isothermal solidification only , but it can be easily extended to non - isothermal situations : coupled equations for the phase field , the temperature field and the chemical potential field can be developed by following the same steps as done here for each transport field separately , taking also into account off - diagonal elements in the onsager matrix of transport coefficients as well as cross - derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials .",
    "this is anticipated to yield a generalization of the thermosolutal model of ref .",
    ".    moreover , the generalization of the formalism to multi - component systems should be straightforward .",
    "this is particularly interesting because general models for multi - component multi - phase solidification have been developed in the two - phase framework @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the determination of the compositions in the individual phases for given global composition requires to solve a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : muequal ] ) , which represents a set of coupled nonlinear equations ( one for each component ) .",
    "a formulation in terms of the chemical potential would completely avoid this problem and thus potentially offer important gains in computational performance .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the two - phase approach has been used in other contexts .",
    "one example is the treatment of fluid flow in solidification @xcite and two - phase flows @xcite , where two separate velocity fields , one for each phase , are introduced , in contrast to `` coarse - graining '' models in which a single velocity field is used @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to reassess the relations between these different models in the light of the present findings ."
