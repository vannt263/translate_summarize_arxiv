    "as the early surveys revealed @xcite , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are sources of x - ray emission and massive wr@xmath7ob binaries are the brightest amongst them . pointed x - ray observations with modern observatories ( _ chandra , xmm - newton _ ) confirmed this and provided us with grating spectra of wr@xmath7ob binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that are rich in spectral lines from different ionic species which indicates a range of x - ray plasma temperatures .",
    "these findings suggest that the enhanced x - ray emission is produced in colliding - stellar - wind ( csw ) shocks , as first proposed by @xcite and @xcite .    the available pointed _ chandra and xmm - newton _",
    "observations suggest that the x - ray properties of presumably single wr stars might correlate with their subtype .",
    "namely , the wn ( nitrogen - rich ) objects have x - ray spectra with prominent emission lines originating from an admixture of cool ( kt  @xmath8  kev ) and hot ( kt  @xmath9  kev ) plasma @xcite .",
    "only one of the four wo ( oxygen - rich ) stars in the galaxy , wr 142 , has been observed so far and it is a weak but extremely hard x - ray source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the single wc ( carbon - rich ) stars are conspicuously x - ray quiet : all the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ pointed observations of wcs so far have resulted in non - detections ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray production mechanism in single wr stars is still not well - understood , but the ubiquitous presence of a high - temperature x - ray component in wr spectra is a clear indication that other processes besides embedded , radiative wind shocks are contributing ( @xcite and references therein ) .    overall , binary systems , especially wide binaries , are more x - ray luminous than comparable single wr stars",
    ". for single wr stars @xmath10 is typically in the range @xmath11  ergs s@xmath6 @xcite , while for the known wide wr@xmath7ob binaries it is about an order of magnitude higher , with wr  140 having the largest known luminosity of @xmath12  ergs s@xmath6 @xcite . as a rule ,",
    "if a wr star is detected with @xmath13  ergs s@xmath6 , it is most likely a wide csw binary system .    in this _ letter _ , we report the first x - ray detection of the wolf - rayet star wr  48a  , which establishes it as a very luminous x - ray source and as such , a likely multiple system .",
    "wr  48a  was discovered in a near - infrared survey and originally classified as a wc9 object @xcite with a current spectral classification of wc8 @xcite .",
    "wr  48a  is located inside the g305 star - forming region in the scutum crux arm of the galaxy . within @xmath14 of wr  48a  are two compact infrared clusters ( danks 1 and 2 ) and its proximity to them suggests that this wr star likely originates from one or the other @xcite .",
    "the optical extinction towards wr  48a  is very high , a@xmath15  mag @xcite , with a small fraction of it ( @xmath16  mag ) coming from circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "the infrared variability of wr  48a  suggests that it is a long - period episodic dust - maker @xcite , but the dust - formation history indicates that the actual situation might be more complex .",
    "namely , @xcite proposed the existence of a short - period ( @xmath17  yr ) binary in addition to the longer - period binary ( @xmath18  yr ) , where the latter is thought to cause the episodic dust formation . high - angular resolution near - infrared observations revealed a 70 mas size for the dust shell in wr  48a  @xcite .",
    "the distance to wr  48a  is not well constrained .",
    "if it is physically associated with the open clusters danks 1 and 2 , @xcite estimated a distance of 4 kpc , but @xcite adopted a _",
    "photometric _ distance of 1.21 kpc based on a wc8 spectral classification .",
    "no information is available for the mass - loss rate and velocity of the stellar wind in wr  48a .",
    "but , indirect evidence of its powerful wind comes from mid - infrared observations of the region surrouding wr  48a  @xcite , which reveal a three - lobed nebula whose morphology is suggestive of a wind - blown structure and triggered massive star formation .",
    "wr  48a  was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ on jan 9 , 2008 .",
    "as discussed below , the presence of numerous spectral lines and our spectral analysis show that the x - ray emission is thermal and is heavily absorbed . the high absorption masks most emission in the rgs energy range below 2 kev ,",
    "so we were not able to obtain any valuable information from the grating spectra .",
    "thus , this study is based on the _ xmm - newton _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic ) data which after excluding background flares resulted in effective exposures of 57 ksec for the pn spectrum and 71 ksec per mos spectrum .",
    "the corresponding total number of x - ray counts in the ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) energy range was : 75,000 ( pn ) , 51,000 ( mos1 ) and 50,000 ( mos2 ) .",
    "we used the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( version 10.0.0 ) to extract the source and background spectra and to construct the corresponding response matrices and ancillary response files .",
    "we used standard as well as custom models in version 11.3.2 of xspec @xcite for our spectral analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows the soft and hard - band images of wr  48a  that illustrate an excellent correspondence between the x - ray source and the optical coordinates of this star ( j2000 ) : @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "there is an optical star located @xmath23  from wr  48a  in the southwest direction @xcite but we find no detectable x - ray emission from that source .",
    "thus , all the epic x - ray emission should be associated with wr  48a ) and no other sources contribute to its x - ray emission ( gagn et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) . ]",
    "a general property of the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of wr  48a  is that it is heavily absorbed and most of the x - ray photons are at energies @xmath24  kev .",
    "we thus re - binned the pn , mos1 , and mos2 epic spectra in the 0.5 - 10 kev range to a minimum of 100 counts per bin and fitted them simultaneously .",
    "we used discrete - temperature plasma models to derive the global properties of the x - ray emitting plasma in wr  48a .",
    "we considered two limiting cases : ( i ) models that assume plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , and ( ii ) plasma with non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) .",
    "for consistency in the atomic data , we made use of emission models _ vapec _ and _ vpshock _ in xspec .",
    "since no specific information is available on the wr  48a  abundances , we adopted the following set of abundances typical for the wc stars ( by number ) : h  @xmath25 , he  @xmath26 , c  @xmath27 , n  @xmath25 , o  @xmath28 , ne  @xmath29 , mg  @xmath30 , si  @xmath31 , s  @xmath32 , fe  @xmath33 @xcite",
    ". ar and ca are not present in the @xcite abundance set , so assumed a fiducial value of @xmath34 .",
    "we varied the ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca and fe abundances in the spectral fits since these elements provide most of the x - rays at energies @xmath35  kev . table  [ tab : fits ] and figure  [ fig : spectra ] present the results from the two - temperature model spectral fits of wr  48a .    though the quality of the two - temperature _ vapec _ model fit is acceptable , the nei _",
    "vpshock _ model provides a better fit to the data . applying the @xcite conversion ( n@xmath36a@xmath37  @xmath38 ) , we find that the x - ray absorption is consistent ( within 10 - 15% ) with the optical extinction ( a@xmath15  mag ;   [ sec : thestar ] ) .",
    "but , the x - ray data may indicate some extra absorption ( @xmath39% ) if a more recent conversion is used , based on studies of star - forming regions : n@xmath40a@xmath37  @xmath38 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the derived abundance values are in general consistent with the adopted set of non - solar wc abundances .",
    "however , the abundance values derived from x - ray analysis and especially from ccd spectra should be considered with caution .",
    "also , due to the high x - ray absorption no valuable information could be derived for the abundances of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "but perhaps the most important result from the global fits is that at least two components with different plasma temperatures are needed to obtain an acceptable representation of the observed spectrum , and the hot component requires a relatively high temperature .",
    "the hot component ( kt  @xmath41  kev ) provides about 75 - 85% of the observed flux , while the cooler component ( kt  @xmath42  kev ) provides @xmath43% of the unabsorbed x - ray emission from this wc star .",
    "in addition to the two - component models , we ran some more complex models : ( i ) a model with a thermal cie plasma distribution based on our custom model which is similar to _ c6pvmkl _ in xspec , but uses the _ apec",
    "_ collisional plasma for the x - ray spectrum at a given temperature ; and ( ii ) a model with a distribution of adiabatic nei shocks which made use of our custom xspec model which was successfully used in the analysis of the x - ray spectra of snr  1987a ( e.g. , @xcite , and the references therein ) . due to the high x - ray absorption ,",
    "the x - ray spectral fits of wr  48a  are not sensitive to the presence of very cool plasma .",
    "thus , we considered only plasma temperatures above 0.5  kev for the emission measure distribution in wr  48a .",
    "the fit results are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : dem ] shows that the derived distribution of emission measure is bimodal , with temperature peaks closely matching the components of the two - temperature models .    from the above results ,",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that there is evidence for a two - temperature distribution in the x - ray emitting region of wr  48a .",
    "but , it is worthwhile to treat such results with caution when based on ccd spectra since the spectral lines are not well resolved and the lines ( and their ratios ) are most sensitive to the presence of a variety of plasma temperatures .",
    "but , we believe that the bimodal distribution is in fact an indicator of a temperature - stratified x - ray emission region in wr  48a .",
    "the two most important results from the model fits to the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of wr  48a  are that it is a very luminous x - ray source and thermal plasmas with high temperature dominate its emission ( table  [ tab : fits ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dem ] ) . using the unabsorbed flux values from table  [ tab : fits ] , the x - ray luminosity of wr  48a  is l@xmath44 ergs s@xmath6 , where @xmath45 is the distance in units of kpc .",
    "the upper limit is from the nei shock model which gives a better quality of fit .",
    "the distance to wr  48a  is not tightly constrained and a range of values is available in the literature : @xmath46 (   [ sec : thestar ] ) .",
    "but , based on its proximity to the open clusters danks 1 and 2 and the similar interstellar extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the distance of 4 kpc seems more realistic , which puts the x - ray luminosity in the range l@xmath47 ergs s@xmath6 . in this case and",
    "excluding the most x - ray luminous wr star , cyg x-3 , which is a wr binary with a compact companion ( a neutron star or a black hole ) , wr  48a  is the most luminous wr star in the galaxy among those observed so far . for example , the x - ray luminosity of the brightest csw binary , wr 140 , is : @xmath48 ergs s@xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . adopting the bolometric luminosity from @xcite",
    ", we note the very high value of @xmath49 $ ] for wr  48a .",
    "all this raises the interesting question about the x - ray production mechanism in wr  48a .    _",
    "colliding stellar winds .",
    "_ as already mentioned , wr  48a  is an episodic dust - maker @xcite which suggests that csws in a wide binary system with an eccentric orbit might provide most of its x - ray emission , as is the case for the prototype episodic dust - maker amongst wr stars , wr 140 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of information about the stellar wind parameters of wr  48a  did not allow us to make a comparison between the theoretical predictions based on hydrodynamic csw modeling and observations .",
    "on the other hand , some simple ( e.g. _ qualitative _ ) considerations are possible .",
    "the temperature of the hot plasma component deduced from the global spectral fits (  [ sec : global ] ) can provide an estimate of the stellar wind velocity ( see  5.2 in @xcite for discussion of csw models versus discrete - temperature models ) .",
    "for the case of typical wc abundances , the postshock plasma temperature is kt  @xmath50  kev , where @xmath51 is the shock velocity in units of 1000  km s@xmath6  . from table  [",
    "tab : fits ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dem ] , we see that the stellar wind of the wc star in wr  48a  must have a velocity v@xmath52  km s@xmath6  . such high velocities would be expected for wc8 - 9 stars since they have typical average wind speeds 1400  km s@xmath6  @xcite , 1300  km s@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "we note that the derived values for ionization age of the shocks in the two - temperature model ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) and in the model with a distribution of nei shocks ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dem ] ) are also qualitatively consistent with the csw picture .",
    "namely , the higher density and higher temperature plasma is located near the axis of symmetry ( the line - of - centers between the two stars ) while the less dense and cooler plasma is found downstream from that axis .",
    "thus , it is natural in the csw picture that the higher temperature plasma will have a larger ionization age .",
    "we can use the scaling law for the csw x - ray luminosity with the mass - loss rate ( @xmath53 ) , wind velocity ( @xmath54 ) and binary separation ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) for a comparison between wr  48a  and the classical csw binary wr 140 . adopting the wr 140 binary parameters",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a wind velocity of @xmath57  km s@xmath6  in wr  48a  and assuming that its mass loss is equal to that of wr 140 , we see that the binary separation in wr  48a  could be similar to that in wr 140 even when the wr  48a  x - ray luminosity is about an order of magnitude larger than that of wr 140 ( see above )",
    ". therefore , the csw picture in a wide binary system is at least qualitatively consistent with the observational data for wr  48a .",
    "_ magnetically confined wind shocks ( mcws ) .",
    "_ this mechanism is capable of producing hard x - ray emission .",
    "it was proposed to explain the high plasma temperature found in x - ray emission from young massive stars and requires the presence of a relatively strong magnetic field ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then , could it be that the wc star in wr  48a  is a magnetized object or has a close magnetized companion ?",
    "we note that the x - ray luminosity of the prototype mcws object , @xmath58   ori c , is l@xmath59 ergs s@xmath6 @xcite which is one to two orders of magnitude below that of wr  48a .",
    "thus , we can likely rule out the case of a close magnetized companion . on the other hand",
    ", the mcws mechanism does not seem promising if adopted directly to the wc star in wr  48a .",
    "first , in order to be efficient this mechanism requires a relatively strong global magnetic field to confine the massive wr wind and no such fields have been reported at present for these stars .",
    "second , because of the expected decay of the magnetic field strength with the age of a massive star , the mcws mechanism is associated only with young massive stars ( age @xmath2  myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the likely association of wr  48a  with the open clusters danks 1 , 2 and the recent estimate of @xmath60  myr for their age @xcite present serious difficulties for the mcws model in the case of wr  48a .",
    "_ wind accretion shocks",
    ". _ the presence of a close degenerate companion ( e.g. a neutron star ) seems very intriguing and accretion onto such an object can in general provide high x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "details depend on the actual binary parameters and wind properties of the main stellar component which are yet unknown for wr  48a .",
    "but , this case may not be unlikely if wr  48a  is indeed a member of the 5-myr - old open clusters danks 1 , 2 and if it once had a more massive close companion which has already evolved and exploded as a supernova .",
    "we have listed above some physical mechanisms that might be able to explain the observed x - ray properties of wr  48a .",
    "one could continue this list by considering other mechanisms or even more complex combinations of those mentioned above .",
    "but , all such mechanisms and the corresponding physical picture remain quite speculative because of the scarcity of detailed observational data for wr  48a  .",
    "thus , we will end our discussion by simply mentioning the cases that look least speculative to us and briefly discuss what observational information may help distinguish between them .    for the moment , the following cases are the most likely explanation for the x - ray properties of wr  48a : ( i ) csws in a wide binary system ; or ( ii ) accretion wind shocks in a close binary : wr@xmath7compact companion ( a neutron star ) .",
    "variability is a key parameter for distinguishing between these cases .",
    "namely , if long - term ( months , years ) x - ray variability is established from future observations , then case ( i ) would be strongly favored .",
    "furthermore , case ( i ) would be strengthened if variable non - thermal radio ( ntr ) emission from wr  48a  is eventually discovered and even more so if the x - ray emission is found to modulate at a similar period . in general ,",
    "ntr wrs are commonly associated with wide binary systems ( @xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "if short - term ( a few days ) variability is established or a sudden change of the x - ray luminosity is detected , case ( ii ) would be favored .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data show no significant variability on timescales @xmath61  day ; the kolmogorov - smirnov test rules out variability at the 95% confidence level . on the other hand , based on the infrared variability of wr  48a , @xcite proposed that it is a triple stellar system .",
    "if so , we may expect some very long - period variability due to the x - rays from csws in a wide binary with eccentric orbit and some with a much shorter period that could result from the stellar wind shocking onto a non - degenerate companion . in this case , wr 48a would be very similar to the csw binary wr 147 which was recently resolved into a double x - ray source with _",
    "chandra _ ,",
    "of which one component is variable and possibly an unresolved binary ( @xcite , b ) .",
    "however , wr 48a has a much higher x - ray luminosity . finally , we hope that the unusually high l@xmath62 of wr  48a  will motivate deeper follow - up observations across the entire spectrum ( radio , infrared , optical , uv , x - rays ) .",
    "such observations would provide us with valuable information about the star and its wind properties that could be very helpful for constraining the physical picture in this remarkable but understudied wolf - rayet system .",
