    "a plasma is a partially or completely ionized gas .",
    "when a plasma is of low density or the time scales of interest are sufficiently small , it is deemed to be `` collisionless '' , as collisions between particles become infrequent .",
    "the fundamental equations which describe the time evolution of a collisionless plasma are given by the three - dimensional vlasov - maxwell system : @xmath2 this nonlinear system of integro - differential equations is supplemented by a set of initial conditions @xmath3 , and @xmath4 here , @xmath5 represents the density of ( positively - charged ) ions in the plasma , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the charge and current densities , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent electric and magnetic fields generated by the charge and current .",
    "the independent variables , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent time , position , and velocity , respectively , and physical constants , such as the speed of light @xmath12 , have been normalized . in the presence of large velocities , relativistic corrections",
    "may be necessary .",
    "the corresponding system to consider is then the relativistic analogue of ( [ vm ] ) , denoted by ( rvm ) and constructed by replacing @xmath13 with @xmath14 within the first equation of ( [ vm ] ) , called the vlasov equation , and the integrand of the current @xmath7 . for a general reference concerning kinetic models of plasma dynamics , such as and ( rvm ) ,",
    "see @xcite .    over the years",
    "some progress has been made in the analysis of ( rvm ) , specifically establishing the global existence of weak solutions ( which also holds for ( vm ) ; see @xcite ) and determining a sufficient condition which ensures global existence of classical solutions for the cauchy problem @xcite . in lower - dimensional settings ,",
    "this condition has been shown to hold _ a priori _ @xcite .",
    "additionally , a wide array of information has been discovered regarding the electrostatic versions of both ( [ vm ] ) and ( rvm ) , known as the vlasov - poisson and relativistic vlasov - poisson systems , respectively .",
    "these models do not include magnetic effects , and the electric field is given by an elliptic equation , rather than a hyperbolic system of pdes .",
    "this simplification has led to a great deal of progress concerning the electrostatic systems , including theorems regarding global existence and long - time behavior of solutions @xcite . however",
    ", a global existence theorem for classical solutions stemming from arbitrary data in the relativistic case has remained elusive .",
    "independent of these advances , many of the most basic well - posedness questions remain unsolved for ( [ vm ] ) , and few results exist within the literature , with @xcite representing exceptions .",
    "the main difficulty which arises is the loss of strict hyperbolicity of the kinetic system due to the possibility that particle velocities @xmath13 may travel faster than the propagation of signals from the electric and magnetic fields , which do so at the speed of light @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "as one can see , this difficulty is remedied physically by the inclusion of relativistic velocity corrections which uniformly constrain velocities @xmath16 . in many macroscopic physical systems",
    "one does not consider the effects of special relativity , but at the kinetic level such velocity corrections may play a fundamental role , even in the basic well - posedness of solutions . hence , one of the primary goals of the current work is to understand how this affects such properties , and establish a precise result that guarantees the continued smoothness of solutions as long as velocity characteristics do not assume magnitudes that approach @xmath12",
    ". often a remedy to the lack of progress on such a problem is to reduce the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the lowest - dimensional reduction which retains magnetic effects is the so - called `` one - and - one - half - dimensional '' vlasov - maxwell system which is constructed by taking @xmath17 but @xmath18 , yielding the system of pdes @xmath19 and initial conditions @xmath20 here , @xmath9 is now a scalar field and the associated electric field possesses only two components , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "additionally , the given , neutralizing background density @xmath23 is included in order to study solutions with finite energy .",
    "if one takes @xmath24 , then @xmath25 and solutions necessarily possess infinite energy .",
    "surprisingly , the question of classical regularity of solutions remains open even in this simplified case .",
    "the fundamental issue of persists within , namely that the reduced vlasov characteristics in the density equation propagate at an uncontrollable speed @xmath26 and hence , are able to intersect the field characteristics which propagate with speed @xmath27 . though we can not currently prove that all initial data launch a global - in - time solution , we can provide an answer for certain classes of initial data ( see section @xmath28 ) and establish uniform bounds on derivatives arbitrarily close to this possible intersection of characteristics .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will derive _ a priori _ estimates in order to prove the main result .",
    "the first lemma obtains bounds on the spatial and velocity supports of the particle distribution and the associated fields , while the main theorem guarantees a uniform bound on derivatives of the distribution function as long as particle velocities do not approach the set on which @xmath0 .",
    "the proofs of these results then follow in the latter portion of the section .",
    "finally , in section @xmath28 , we present a theorem concerning global existence for initial particle densities that are even in @xmath1 .",
    "we show that this symmetry property is preserved in time by solutions of and a reduction in complexity occurs which allows us to conclude that smooth solutions exist globally in time .    throughout the paper",
    "the value @xmath29 will denote a generic constant that may change from line to line and depend upon the neutralizing density @xmath23 , existence time @xmath30 , and initial data .",
    "when necessary , we will specifically identify a constant with a subscript ( e.g. , @xmath31 ) .",
    "finally , since we are interested in classical solutions , we will assume @xmath32 for the entirety of the paper .",
    "to begin this section , we will first prove a lemma that bounds the support of the particle density and the associated electric and magnetic fields .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath33 be given and assume that @xmath34 is a @xmath35 solution of ( [ 1.5dvm ] ) on @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 satisfying the global neutrality assumption @xmath39 then , there exists @xmath29 , such that @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and @xmath18 implies @xmath42 additionally , there is @xmath29 such that @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .    with this result in hand , we may further obtain bounds on derivatives of the particle distribution function .",

    "first , we define characteristics for the vlasov equation . these are the curves @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "satisfying @xmath50 often , the @xmath51 dependence of these curves will be suppressed so , for example , @xmath48 will be denoted by @xmath52 for brevity .",
    "then , the vlasov equation can be expressed as a derivative along the characteristic curves by @xmath53 .",

    "it is straightforward to check the energy conservation identity @xmath71 so that @xmath72 using the supremum bound on @xmath5 and the kinetic energy portion of the identity , we estimate @xmath7 .",

    "finally , the field bounds follow precisely from this estimate and . similarly , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
