    "@xmath0 may be produced electromagnetically ( via photoproduction ) in distant interactions between ultra - relativistic heavy ions . in these ultra - peripheral collisions",
    "( upcs ) @xcite , a photon from the electromagnetic field of one nucleus fluctuates to a quark - antiquark pair , which then scatters elastically from the other nucleus , emerging as a vector meson @xcite .",
    "elastic scattering is colorless , and can be described in terms of soft pomeron exchange . for light mesons like the @xmath0 ,",
    "the cross section rises slowly with the photon energy @xmath6 . for small momentum transfers ,",
    "the elastic scattering is coherent over the entire nuclear target , greatly increasing the cross section . for heavy mesons , the scattering cross section scales as the atomic number @xmath7 , while for lighter mesons like the @xmath0 , a glauber calculation finds that shadowing reduces the dependence to approximately @xmath8 @xcite .",
    ".8 in    the large photon flux and the coherent scattering lead to a large cross section for @xmath0 production . for 200 gev per nucleon au - au collisions at rhic ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath0 production is 590 mb , or about 8% of the hadronic cross section @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration has already measured @xmath0 production in au - au collisions at an energy of 130 gev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "the cross sections agreed with the glauber calculations .",
    "the elastic scattering is mediated by the strong force , and so has a short range @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 production is localized to within 1 fm of the two ions .",
    "figure 1a shows the two possibilities : either nucleus 1 emits a photon which scatters off nucleus 2 , or vice versa .",
    "these two possibilities are indistinguishable , and are related by a parity transformation .",
    "vector mesons have negative parity , so the two amplitudes subtract , with a transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) dependent phase factor to account for the separation .",

    "the system acts as a 2-slit interferometer , with slit separation @xmath17 @xcite . of course , @xmath17 is unmeasurable , and the observed @xmath10 spectrum is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( 1 ) over all @xmath17 , subject to the constraint that there are no hadronic interactions ( roughly equivalent to @xmath18 ) .",
    "the cross section is suppressed for @xmath19 , where @xmath3 is the median impact parameter .",
    "interestingly , for photo    the @xmath9 decay distance , @xmath20 fm is far less than @xmath21 fm .",
    "the @xmath0 decay before the amplitudes from the two sources can overlap , making this an interesting test of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the electromagnetic coupling constant ) is large , so multiple interactions between a single ion pair are common .",
    "the @xmath0 production may be accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation , as in fig .",
    "each ion emits a photon , which excites the other nucleus , usually to a giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "the resonance decays by emitting one or more neutrons .",
    "these neutrons are a clear experimental signature for nuclear dissociation .",
    "the mutual coulomb dissociation also ` tags ' collisions with moderate impact parameters , @xmath24 fm @xcite . as long as @xmath25 , the photon flux drops as @xmath26 . for a single photon reaction like @xmath0 production",
    ", the production probability @xmath27 follows the same scaling . for n - photon interactions ,",
    "@xmath28 @xcite so the median impact parameter is much smaller and interference is visible at larger @xmath10 .    except for the shared impact parameter ,",
    "the photon exchange reactions are independent @xcite .",

    ", @xmath32 is the probability of having a hadronic interaction ; the last term has an effect similar to setting a minimum impact parameter @xmath33 . for gold ions , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "so the probability of multiple interactions is substantial . through the smaller @xmath17s ,",
    "the photon spectra in multi - photon interactions are harder than for single photon reactions .",
    "the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) studies heavy - ion and polarized proton collisions at the rhic collider brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "star is optimized for high - multiplicity final states , but it is also effective for 2 - 4 charged particle final states from upcs .",
    "star collected upc data in gold - gold collisions at energies of 130 gev per nucleon ( in 2000 ) and 200 gev per nucleon ( in 2001 ) .",
    "star has also studied @xmath0 photoproduction in 200 gev per nucleon deuteron on gold collisions @xcite .",

    "the track position and specific energy loss , @xmath39 were measured at 45 points for high momentum charged particles with @xmath40 .",
    "the tpc is surrounded by 240 scintillator slats covering @xmath40 , comprising the central trigger barrel ( ctb ) .",
    "two zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) are located 18 m upstream and downstream of the interaction point .",
    "these calorimeters are sensitive to neutrons from mutual coulomb dissociation @xcite .",
    "two different triggers @xcite were used to study interference .",
    "the ` topology ' trigger selected events with 2 roughly back - to - back tracks in the ctb . it divided the ctb into 4 quadrants : north , south , top and bottom , and required hits in the north and south quadrants .",
    "the top and bottom regions were used as vetoes to reject cosmic rays .    the minimum bias trigger selected events with one or more neutrons in each zdc .",
    "the zdc signals were required to occur within 1 nsec , restricting these events to the central 30 cm of the tpc .",
    "data from both triggers was processed identically , except that events from the ctb based trigger were distributed more broadly along the tpc axis , and consequently , were accepted in a broader range .",
    "upc @xmath0 production has a distinctive signature - two oppositely charged tracks with small net @xmath10 .",
    "we select events with exactly 2 primary tracks that form a vertex .",
    "the vertexing procedure considers all of the tracks in an event , and rejects tracks that are inconsistent with coming from a single vertex .",
    "we allow a few non - primary background tracks in the tpc .",
    "the topology and minimum bias data were treated identically , except that allowance was made for the different distribution of the accepted event production points .",
    "this study used about 1.5 million minimum bias and about 1.7 million topology triggers .",
    "this analysis will study the @xmath10 spectra of produced @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2a shows the rapidity distribution of the coherent @xmath0 ( pairs with @xmath41 mev / c ) .",
    "the points ( data ) are in excellent agreement with a calculation based on the soft pomeron model and our detector simulation .",
    "figure 2b shows the @xmath42 invariant mass , @xmath43 for the sample .",
    "the data is fit to a relativistic breit - wigner for the @xmath0 , plus a sding term to account for the interference with direct @xmath5 production @xcite .",
    "the interference shifts the peak of the distribution to lower @xmath43 .",
    "the direct @xmath42 to @xmath9 ratio agrees with the star 130 gev analysis @xcite and with studies by the zeus collaboration in @xmath44 interactions @xcite .",
    "however , with the nuclear coherence , the star data is at smaller @xmath45 than the zeus analysis , so the two results may not be directly comparable @xcite .",
    "stringent event selection criteria were used to select a clean , low - background sample for the @xmath0 interference study .",
    "events were required to have exactly two tracks with a vertex within 50 ( 100 ) cm longitudinally of the center of the tpc for the minimum bias ( topology trigger ) sample . @xmath0 candidates with @xmath46",
    "were eliminated to avoid possible contamination from cosmic rays .",
    "the pairs were required to have 550 mev @xmath47 mev .",
    "the minimum mass cut removed most of the hadronic backgrounds , which are concentrated at low @xmath43 .",
    "these cuts reduced the like - sign pair background to a few percent . with these cuts ,",
    "the background from misidentified two - photon reactions like @xmath48 should be very small .",
    "the sample still includes direct pions , which should have the same spin / parity and quantum mechanical behavior as the pion pairs from @xmath9 decay .",
    "we do not distinguish between the two sources .",
    "the magnitude of the interference depends on the ratio of the amplitudes for @xmath9 production on the two nuclei .",
    "away from @xmath49 , the photon energies for the two photon directions differ , @xmath50 ; the amplitudes differ and the interference is sub - maximal . although it is not expected in the soft - pomeron model , the the photon energy difference could introduce a small @xmath0 production phase difference , which could affect the interference @xcite .",
    "this analysis focuses on the region near mid - rapidity where any phase difference should be small .",
    "a monte carlo is used to find the interference for different rapidity ranges @xcite .",
    "we study the @xmath10 spectra using the variable @xmath51 . at rhic energies ,",
    "the longitudinal component of the 4-momentum transfer is small , so @xmath52 . without interference ,",
    "the spectrum @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "figure 3 compares the uncorrected minimum bias data for @xmath54 gev@xmath55 , consistent with the @xmath56 fm expected for a @xmath0 accompanied by mutual excitation @xcite .",
    "this data matches calculation with interference , but not the no - interference result .",
    "[ rawinterfere ]    the efficiency corrected data are shown in fig .",
    "minimum bias and topology data are shown separately , each with two rapidity bins : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the efficiency is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "however @xmath10 smearing ( resolution ) does affect the spectrum slightly ; the efficiency correction removes this .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath10 resolution is about 9 mev / c , while the 1st @xmath59 bin covers 0 to ( 15 mev / c)@xmath55 .",
    "interference depletes the first few bins , but feed down from the higher t bins partially repopulates them .",
    "[ tspectra ]    .01 in    the data is fit to the 3-parameter form : @xmath60\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the ratio of the monte carlo t - spectra with and without interference . here",
    ", @xmath62 is the overall normalization , the slope @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the degree of spectral modification ; @xmath65 corresponds to no interference while @xmath66 is the calculated interference .",
    "this functional form separates the interference ( @xmath64 ) from the nuclear form factor ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "table 1 gives the results of the fits . at small - rapidities",
    "the amplitudes from the two directions are similar and the interference reduces the cross section at @xmath67 by more than at larger rapidities . in the minimum bias data , the interference extends to higher @xmath10 than the topology data because the former has a smaller @xmath3 .",
    ".results of the fits to the two datasets for the two rapidity bins . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the 4 @xmath64 values are consistent within errors ; the weighted average is @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath17 values for the minimum bias and exclusive @xmath0 data differ by 20% : @xmath69 gev@xmath70 for the exclusive @xmath9 versus @xmath71 gev@xmath70 for the coulomb breakup events .",
    "the different @xmath17 values may be attributed to the different impact parameter distributions caused by the nuclear breakup tagging in the minimum bias data .",
    "the photon flux depends on the impact parameter as @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath72 , @xmath9 are more likely to be produced on the side of the target near the photon emitter than on the far side .",
    "@xmath0 production is concentrated on the near side , leading to a smaller effective production volume and the smaller @xmath17 .",
    "this near - side skewing affects the interference slightly , but is not included in current calculations .",
    "systematic errors come from a variety of sources .",
    "we have studied the effect of detector distortions ( primarily @xmath10 smearing ) by turning off the detector simulation and comparing raw simulations with reconstructed data .",
    "this lowered @xmath64 by 18% ; if the detector simulation is 75% correct ( a very conservative assumption ) , then detector effects are a less than 5% systematic uncertainty .",
    "minor systematic uncertainties come from backgrounds and the fitting procedure .",
    "we have compared the data and simulations for a variety of kinematic and detector - based variables , and found good agreement .",
    "we estimate a preliminary experimental systematic uncertainty of 8% .",
    "this analysis depends on the shape of @xmath73 , which is calculated following ref .",
    "there are some simplifications in ref .",
    "the calculation averages the photon flux over the surface of the nucleus , rather than incorporating the proper @xmath26 weighting .",
    "this may partly explain the relatively poor fit for the large-@xmath74 coulomb breakup fit .",
    "we estimate that the effective impact parameter should be within 10% of the actual ion - ion separation for the coulomb breakup data , and 3% for the exclusive @xmath9 .",
    "the uncertainties in the calculations should be at most a 15% effect . with this , the interference is @xmath75 ( star preliminary ) of that expected .",
    "the @xmath9 decays rapidly , with @xmath76 and the two @xmath9 decay points are well separated in space - time . in the usual space - time picture , the decays occur independently , and any interference must involve the final state @xmath5 .",
    "interference must involve identical final states from the two sources .",
    "however , given the large available phase space for the decays , this is very unlikely for independent decays .",
    "one interpretation of this result is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in it ,",
    "the interference occurs because the post - decay wave function includes amplitudes for all possible final states , then the amplitudes for identical states subtract , and the interference is visible . because of the two sources , the @xmath5 wave function is non - factorizable , and thus exhibits the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox @xcite .",
    "we find that the decoherence , @xmath77 , due to environmental or other factors is less than 43% at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the star collaboration has studied exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction and @xmath0 photoproduction accompanied by nuclear excitation .",
    "the cross sections and rapidity distributions match the predictions of the soft pomeron model .",
    "production at low@xmath78 is suppressed , as expected if @xmath0 production at the two ions interferes destructively .",
    "the suppression is @xmath79 of that expected .",
    "the decoherence is less than @xmath80 at a 90% confidence level .",
