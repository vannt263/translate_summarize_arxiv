    "in recent years , beam energy scan ( bes ) program carried out at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) has drawn much attention with an aim to explore the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram at non - zero temperature ( @xmath2 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "one of the key observable is related to the event - by - event distribution of conserved charge numbers such as : net - baryon , net - electric charge and net - strangeness  @xcite .",
    "current experiments at rhic have reported the measurements for various order moments of net - proton and net - charge event - by - event distributions using the bes phase - i data  @xcite . from the net - proton measurement ,",
    "deviations are observed for @xmath4 27 gev for ratios of higher order cumulants compared to expectation from a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model and skellam statistics  @xcite .",
    "however , from the experimental side , there is no conclusive evidence about the location of the qcd critical end point ( cep ) . this has prompted to have high statistics bes - ii program scheduled for 2018 - 19 with the focus on taking data at lower beam energies ( below 39 gev ) .",
    "so far , the reported experimental measurements are based on higher moments of either net - proton or net - charge multiplicity distribution , which are related to baryon number or electric charge susceptibilities , respectively  @xcite",
    ".    probes of phase structure of qcd should also include correlations among different conserved charges  @xcite .",
    "they are not only expected to vary in some characteristic manner between low and high temperature phases of qcd but also provide insight into applicability of the hrg model .",
    "it has been suggested that , the ratio of strange to non - strange susceptibilities calculated in lattice qcd can give insight about quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase  @xcite .",
    "the correlation between baryon number ( @xmath5 ) and electric charge ( @xmath6 ) ( @xmath7 ) shows a variation with the temperature which are correlated with the changes in relevant degrees of freedom  @xcite . at lower temperature @xmath7",
    "is dominated by contributions from protons and anti - protons , whereas in the high temperature limit of ( 2 + 1 ) flavor qcd , their values are due to quark degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly , correlations of baryons with strangeness ( @xmath8 ) and electric charge with strangeness ( @xmath9 ) are sensitive to the strangeness degrees of freedom of the system  @xcite . at high temperature limit , in which the basic degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons , the strangeness is carried by the @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "quarks that later carry the baryon number in strict proportion to their strangeness number ( @xmath12 ) which makes the @xmath5 and @xmath13 strongly correlated  @xcite . on the other hand , in a hadron gas the strangeness",
    "is mostly carried by kaons with @xmath14 , which makes the correlation between strangeness and baryon number very small .",
    "hence , observables such as @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 give information about the qcd phase structure  @xcite .",
    "further , combinations of diagonal and off - diagonal quark number susceptibilities can be used to obtain the fluctuations of conserved charges  @xcite .",
    "diagonal susceptibilities measure the quark number density to changes in @xmath2 and @xmath15 . at high temperature region",
    "diagonal susceptibilities show large values and expected to approach the ideal gas limit  @xcite . whereas in the low temperature region",
    ", the quarks are confined , the diagonal susceptibilities are expected to have small values .",
    "the off - diagonal susceptibilities in turn can be used to explore the degree of correlation between different charge and baryon numbers that carry different flavors  @xcite . using the ratio of susceptibilities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "it has been observed that , above critical temperature ( @xmath18 ) , the flavor carrying sector of qcd is consistent with deconfined plasma of weakly interacting quarks and antiquarks .",
    "above 1.5@xmath18 , the flavor carrying degrees of freedom are quark - like quasi - particles .",
    "below @xmath18 the behavior of the above susceptibility ratios is consistent with that of hadron resonance gas  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a landmark point in the qcd phase diagram is the cep  @xcite .",
    "as one approaches the cep in the phase diagram , there will be large fluctuations in the event - by - event produced particle numbers  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are quantified by measuring various order moments of the event - by - event particle number distribution .",
    "these moments are related to some power of correlation length ( @xmath19 ) of the system  @xcite .",
    "higher moments of the distributions are related to the higher power of @xmath19 which makes them more sensitive to cep effects  @xcite .",
    "specifically it has been recently suggested to look for mixed pion - proton cumulants as a signature for cep  @xcite .",
    "the paper suggests to construct five specific mixed pion - proton cumulants from which when non - cep contributions are subtracted will yield a value of unity if the system experiences critical phenomena .",
    "such ratios have no theoretical uncertainties arising from uncertainty in the values of the qcd based parameters .",
    "these ratios are claimed to provide strong evidence needed for the discovery of the qcd critical point .    keeping in mind above aspects and the importance of having a proper baseline for the experimental measures , we discuss in the present paper , mixed susceptibilities ( between electric charge , baryon number , and strangeness ) and various order pion - proton cumulants within the frame work of a hrg model  @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here also keeps in mind the actual experimental situation in terms of acceptances ( in momentum and rapidity ) and measurable quantities  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the hrg model used in this study . in section",

    "the experimental acceptances can be applied by considering the corresponding ranges in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath41  @xcite .",

    "<S> the ratios of off - diagonal and diagonal susceptibilities of conserved charges are studied using a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model with an emphasis towards providing a proper baseline for comparison to the corresponding future experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the effect of kinematic acceptances , transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) , and different charged states on the ratios of the calculated susceptibilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effect of @xmath0 and @xmath1 acceptance on the ratio of the susceptibilities are small relative to their dependence on the beam energy or the charged states of the used particles . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a hrg based calculation for various combinations of cumulant ratios of protons and pions , recently proposed as robust observables ( with no theoretical uncertainties ) for critical point search in the experiments . these results which increase as a function of collision energy will provide a better baseline for non - critical point physics compared to poisson expectation . </S>"
