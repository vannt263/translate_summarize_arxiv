    "in recent years , the investigations of non - intersecting brownian motion and random walk paths focused on the description of a critical process called the tacnode process .",
    "this process appears when two groups of trajectories are asymptotically supported in two ellipses in the time - space plane such that the ellipses touch each other creating a tacnode ( self - touching point ) of the macroscopic boundary .",
    "the aim is to describe the behaviour of the paths near the touching point .",
    "a series of recent papers by different groups of authors studied the tacnode process in parallel using various methods .",
    "the first result in this direction is due to adler , ferrari and van moerbeke : in @xcite , a model of non - intersecting random walk paths is considered such that the paths form a symmetric tacnode . in @xcite , delvaux , kuijlaars and zhang studied the non - symmetric case of non - intersecting brownian trajectories and they expressed the critical correlation kernel in terms of the solution of a @xmath2 riemann  hilbert problem . a different approach to the brownian case is due to johansson who gave a formula for the tacnode kernel in terms of the resolvent of the airy kernel in @xcite in the symmetric case .",
    "the latter approach was extended by ferrari and vet in @xcite to the general non - symmetric case .",
    "the tacnode process was also obtained in the tiling problem of the double aztec diamond by adler , johansson and van moerbeke in @xcite .",
    "it was not a priori clear that the various formulas for the tacnode kernel give rise to the same limit process , since the results in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite contain airy resolvent type formulas whereas the kernel in @xcite is expressed with the solution of a riemann  hilbert problem .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the formulation of @xcite and @xcite are equivalent .",
    "a more recent result @xcite gives the equivalence of the riemann ",
    "hilbert formulas in @xcite and the airy resolvent formulas in @xcite and @xcite .    apart from systems of non - intersecting brownian motions and random walk paths , the study of non - intersecting squared bessel paths is also natural due to their representation as eigenvalues of the laguerre process , see  @xcite .",
    "this process is a positive definite matrix valued brownian bridges . since the transition kernel of the squared bessel paths can be given explicitly via modified bessel functions , see , a karlin  mcgregor type formula like can be applied .",
    "non - intersecting squared bessel paths were also studied by katori and tanemura in @xcite , but the first description of the hard edge tacnode process is due to delvaux @xcite .",
    "the formation of the tacnode in this case is slightly different : instead of two touching groups of trajectories in the time - space plane , only one group of paths is considered and its boundary macroscopically touches the hard edge , i.e.  the @xmath3 line .",
    "this configuration is referred to as the hard edge tacnode and the critical process in the neighbourhood of the touching point is called the hard edge tacnode process . in @xcite , the correlation kernel of the hard edge tacnode process is expressed in terms of the solution of a @xmath2 riemann  hilbert problem which is different from the one that appears in the case of the brownian trajectories .",
    "see the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : simulation ] for non - intersecting squared bessel paths with the tacnode scaling of the starting and endpoints . for further figures , see also  @xcite .    in theorem  [ thm : hardedgetacnode ] which is the main result of the present paper we provide an explicit airy type formula for the multi - time correlation kernel of the hard edge tacnode process , under the assumption that the parameter @xmath4 of the bessel process is a ( non - negative ) integer .",
    "the kernel is expressed as a double complex integral , see .",
    "the formula is completely new in the literature .",
    "it is reminiscent to the usual tacnode kernel , but the airy resolvent operator on @xmath0 is replaced by an operator which acts on the direct sum space of @xmath0 and a finite dimensional space .",
    "a different phenomenon appears when the starting points of the non - intersecting squared bessel paths are taken to be @xmath1 and the endpoints are scaled linearly with the number of paths . in this case , there is a critical time such that for any earlier time the lowest path stays close to @xmath1 whereas for any later time the distance of the lowest path from @xmath1 is macroscopic .",
    "after rescaling around the critical time , one obtains the hard edge pearcey process , see the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : simulation ] .",
    "the single time hard edge pearcey kernel was already described by desrosiers and forrester @xcite and later in a different formulation by kuijlaars , martnez - finkelshtein and wielonsky @xcite .",
    "we give the multi - time correlation kernel of the hard edge pearcey process in different formulations in theorems  [ thm : hardedgepearcey ] and  [ thm : pearcey : alternative ] which also shows the equivalence of the formulas in @xcite and @xcite . in corollary",
    "[ cor : bk ] , we obtain the kernel by borodin and kuan @xcite in the special case of one - dimensional squared bessel paths , i.e.  of absolute values of one - dimensional brownian motions .",
    "the main steps how the convergence of the kernel of @xmath5 non - intersecting squared bessel paths to that of the hard edge tacnode is proved are the following .",
    "first we write the kernel as a double complex contour integral using the representation of the modified bessel function .",
    "the integrand can be transformed into the ratio of two toeplitz determinants of sizes @xmath6 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the toeplitz determinants have symbols with non - zero winding numbers around @xmath1 , hence we apply a generalized borodin  okounkov formula due to bttcher and widom in @xcite to obtain theorem  [ theorem : toeplitz ] if the parameter @xmath7 of the squared bessel paths is a ( non - negative ) integer .",
    "then we obtain the ratio of two fredholm type determinants where the two operators are rank one perturbations of each other .",
    "this yields a resolvent type formula in theorem  [ theorem : kernel : n ] which is suitable for asymptotic analysis .",
    "the functions that appear in the finite @xmath5 kernel can be rewritten in terms of bessel functions , hence the asymptotic analysis relies on the convergence of bessel functions which is proved separately in the appendix .",
    "now we introduce the model of non - intersecting squared bessel paths that we consider .",
    "the squared bessel process depends on a parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the transition probability of the squared bessel process for any time @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the modified bessel function which can be given by the series @xmath14 the transition probability @xmath15 is obtained by taking the limit @xmath16 . if @xmath17 is an integer , then the squared bessel process can be obtained as the squared absolute value of a @xmath18-dimensional brownian motion . in this case , we call @xmath18 the dimension of the squared bessel process .",
    "in the present paper , we consider non - intersecting squared bessel paths which start from one fixed point and end at another fixed point . in order to construct this system of paths ,",
    "we first take @xmath5 non - intersecting squared bessel paths with fixed different starting points @xmath19 at time @xmath20 and fixed different ending points @xmath21 at time @xmath22 .",
    "the paths are conditioned to be non - intersecting in the time interval @xmath23 .",
    "it is well known that this defines an extended determinantal point process .",
    "that is , the joint probability at a sequence of times @xmath24 can be expressed via the determinant of an extended correlation kernel @xmath25 .",
    "the kernel @xmath26 is defined in terms of the transition probability @xmath27 in .",
    "namely as given also in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 1.1 ) ) , we have @xmath28 for any positions @xmath29 and times @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the characteristic function of @xmath32 and with @xmath33 defined as the @xmath34 matrix @xmath35    next we take the confluent limit of the starting and ending points @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 and @xmath39 are suitably scaled with the number @xmath5 of the paths , we can create a picture in the time - space plane with a cusp or a tacnode at the hard edge . in this paper",
    ", we obtain the limiting extended correlation kernel of non - intersecting squared bessel paths near the tacnode and the cusp which we call the hard edge tacnode process and the hard edge pearcey process .",

    "the correlation kernel @xmath26 is expressed as a ratio of two toeplitz determinants and in a pre - asymptotic form for finite @xmath5 in subsection  [ ss : finiten ] .",

    "we omit the details .",
