    "physics in extremely high energy regions is particularly of interest to particle physicists .",
    "one of the promising idea in the realm of high energy physics is the idea of supersymmetry ( susy ) ( see for instance [ 1 ] and references therein ) .",
    "this is a symmetry that relates or mixes ( unites ) fermions and bosons .",
    "supersymmetry has the potential to solve some outstanding mysteries in particle physics .",
    "one important problem that stands out is called the _ hierarchy problem_. it is believed that the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath2 , is much smaller than the fundamental planck mass , @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "when we discuss gravity in the context of the quantum field theory , it is expected that there is a minimal measurable length that restricts resolution of adjacent spacetime points up to the planck length .",
    "this is actually a common address of all quantum gravity candidates ( see [ 2 ] and references therein ) .",
    "incorporation of this idea in quantum field theory provides a theory that is naturally regularized in the ultra - violate regime [ 3,4,5 ] .",
    "recently in the context of the doubly special relativity it has been revealed that a test particle s momentum can not be arbitrarily imprecise leading nontrivially to the result that there is a maximal momentum for test particles [ 6 ] .",
    "this idea can be explained also through modified dispersion relations as a phenomenological outcome of foam - like structure of spacetime at the planck scale [ 7,8 ] .",
    "string theory which has a characteristic scale @xmath5 , is one of the most successful theoretical framework which overcomes the difficulty of ultra - violet divergence in quantum theory of gravity .",
    "therefore , if we construct a field theory which captures some stringy nature and/or includes stringy corrections , it would play a pivotal role in investigating physics in high energy regions even near the planck scale .",
    "one way to discuss these corrections is deforming the standard heisenberg uncertainty principle to a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) .",
    "a gup that predicts a minimal observable length can be written as follows    @xmath6    this gup leads to the following algebraic structure    @xmath7=i\\hbar(1+\\beta^{2}p^{2})\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 .",
    "if gup is realized in a certain string theory context , @xmath9 takes a value of the order of the string scale , @xmath10 . in the presence of both minimal length and",
    "maximal momentum , the gup can be given as follows @xmath11 in this framework the following algebraic structure can be deduced [ 9 ] @xmath12=i\\hbar(1-\\beta p+2\\beta^2 p^2)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this context , we can define the generalized momentum operator as @xmath13 with these preliminaries , in this paper we construct a quantum theory of free fermion fields based on the deformed heisenberg algebra ( 4 ) .",
    "we respect the supersymmetry in this context as a guiding principle .",
    "this is because string theory contains this symmetry and it provides a useful tool to understand physics in ultra - violet regime . because of existence of natural cutoffs as minimal length and maximal momentum , the supersymmetry is deformed in this context . from the fermionic part of the system , we propose an action of fermionic field based on the gup in a spacetime with arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "we construct the deformed supersymmetric algebra in this context . finally , we compute some scattering amplitudes such as the pair annihilation amplitude to see how these important quantities can be calculated in the presence of natural cutoffs . we note that experimental limits and the general phenomenology perspective on this issue are not discussed here .",
    "one can see ref . [",
    "10 ] for this purpose .",
    "we note also that while the study of susy in relation to gup is a relatively young subject , a bit more has been done for other quantum - spacetime intuitions .",
    "for instance , in ref . [ 11 ] the authors have studied the basic twist quantization of @xmath14 and kappa - deformation of @xmath15 superconformal mechanics .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we construct a scalar field theory based on the gup ( 4 ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the issue of supersymmetry in the presence of natural cutoffs as minimal length and maximal momentum . in section 4",
    "we compute scattering amplitude of the pair annihilation in the presence of natural cutoffs .",
    "the paper follows by a summary and conclusion in section 5 .",
    "generalization of the heisenberg algebra to @xmath16-dimensions , where rotational symmetry is preserved and there are both a minimal length and maximal momentum as natural cutoffs , is as follows @xmath17}=i\\hbar ( 1-\\beta \\textbf{p}+2\\beta^2 \\textbf{p}^2)\\delta_{ij } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath18 and @xmath19 run from @xmath20 to @xmath16 , where in three dimensions @xmath21 that @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unit vectors of cartesian coordinates and @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter , we use indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 for spatial coordinates and @xmath26 and @xmath27 for all spacetime coordinates .",
    "now the jacobi identity determines the full algebra of the theory which is given as follows ( see the work by k. nozari and a. etemadi in ref .

    "note also that eq .",
    "( 9 ) reflects the noncommutative nature of the spacetime manifold in planck scale . here",
    "@xmath31 are angular momentum like operators defined as    @xmath32    since operators @xmath33 s commute with each other and we have not assumed the existence of a minimal uncertainty in momentum ( see ref . [ 12 ] for possible extension in this regard ) , we can construct our theory in momentum space representation . in momentum space representation ,",
    "momentum operators are diagonalized simultaneously and we do not distinguish eigenvalues of momentum @xmath34 from operator @xmath35 . in which follows , we set @xmath36 for simplicity .",

    "one can see from equation ( 13 ) that a deformation prefactor , @xmath49 , of heisenberg algebra in the first quantization ( 6 ) also appears in canonical commutation relation of the second quantized field theory .    in the fermion field case",
    ", we encounter a difficulty in the construction of the second quantized hilbert space which dose not appear in a scalar field system .",
    "in which follows we use the idea of supersymmetry to construct a quantized field theory of fermions .",
    "in fact , we construct a quantum field theory of fermions , which is consistent with the above scalar field theory , and by using supersymmetry prescription with a minimal length and maximal momentum scale .",
    "supersymmetric quantum field theory with minimal length has been studied by shibusa [ 13 ] .",
    "in which follows , we generalize the pioneer work of shibusa to the more general case that there are both minimal length and maximal momentum as natural cutoffs .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , supersymmetry proposes that to each fermion there exists a boson and vice versa .",
    "thus in two and three - dimensional spacetime , a system with a real scalar and a majorana fermion has a special symmetry between a boson and a fermion , namely susy .",
    "following ref . [ 13 ] , our notation for two and three - dimensional spacetime is as follows : in those dimensional spacetime ( with signature @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) the lorantz group has a real ( majorana ) two - component spinor representation @xmath52 .",
    "for instance , in three - dimensional spacetime , we define a representation of gamma matrices by pauli matrices as follows [ 13 ] :    @xmath53    @xmath54    we note that the spinor indices in this case are lowered or raised by charge conjugation matrix @xmath55 and its inverse matrix @xmath56 .",
    "the generalized supersymmetric algebra in the presence of a minimal length and a maximal momentum and its action on a scalar field @xmath57 , a majorana fermion @xmath58 and an auxiliary field @xmath59 with parameter @xmath60 is as follows @xmath61=2\\upsilon\\bar{\\epsilon}_1\\gamma^a\\epsilon_2p_a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64\\psi(p , t)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are functions of gup deformation parameter @xmath9 and momentum .",
    "these factors reduce to unity in the limit of @xmath67 and will be determined later by consistency condition .",
    "the closeness of algebra requires @xmath68 now the supersymmetric lagrangian can be written as a sum of separate lagrangians , that is , @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are bosonic , fermionic and auxiliary fields lagrangian respectively . following [ 13 ] ,",
    "we generalize the lagrangian by introduction of factors @xmath73 , which are functions of deforming parameter @xmath9 and momentum .",
    "these functions can be determined as follows . starting with lagrangian @xmath74 where @xmath16 is the number of the spatial coordinates . by integrating out the field @xmath59",
    ", we obtain the lagrangian for the scalar and majorana fields as follows @xmath75 on the other hand , the invariance of the lagrangian ( 21 ) under supersymmetry variation ( 17)-(19 ) in the presence of the minimal length and maximal momentum leads to @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 using the conditions ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) , only @xmath79 and @xmath80 need to be determined .",
    "note also that factor @xmath81 can be absorbed into normalization of @xmath59 .",
    "in which follows we set @xmath82 for @xmath59 to be an auxiliary field .",
    "noether s current for supersymmetric lagrangian ( 22 ) can be calculated and the supersymmetric charge is obtained to be @xmath83 now the hamiltonian of this system can be written as follows @xmath84 using the bjorken - johnson - low prescription , from behaviors of @xmath85-product between fields , as has been explained in the previous section , we obtain canonical relations as follows @xmath86=i{\\zeta_1}^{-1}\\delta(p+q),}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath87 therefore , the hamiltonian ( 25 ) now can be written as follows @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "there is another condition that can be used to determine @xmath91 and @xmath92 and comes from the free energy of the supersymmetric vacuum . from algebra",
    "( 16 ) , the supersymmetric state has zero energy @xmath93- \\frac{1}{4}{tr}_f\\ln \\big[\\zeta_1(e^2+\\textbf{p}^2+m^2)\\big],}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent trace in bosonic and fermionic hilbert space respectively .",
    "this relation leads to the following condition @xmath96 finally we can write @xmath97 as one can read from ( 11 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 therefore , we have constructed the quantized field of fermions as follows @xmath101 in consequence , the supersymmetric algebra in the presence of both minimal length and maximal momentum is deformed from the usual one as follows @xmath102=2(1-\\beta \\textbf{p}+2\\beta^2   \\textbf{p}^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\bar{\\epsilon}_1\\gamma^a\\epsilon_2p_a.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these results can be generalized to higher dimensions easily .",
    "finally we note that the lagrangian now takes the following form @xmath103\\psi(p , t)\\big \\}.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that in the presence of quantum gravity effects ( as minimal length and maximal momentum ) there is an extra , universal prefactor @xmath104 in comparison with the usual fermion action , regardless of existence or absence of supersymmetry .",
    "we note that the major difference between our framework and the formalism presented in ref . [",
    "13 ] is the difference in the mentioned prefactor .",
    "our prefactor contains both minimal length and maximal momentum simultaneously .",
    "otherwise , the algebraic structure of the two supersymmetric algebras are the same .",
    "in a perturbative expansion one usually refines the calculations using corrections that are becoming smaller and smaller . the reduction in importance is quantified by the power of the perturbation parameter , which is usually the coupling strength . at some point",
    "we are adding refinements that are too small to be measured and we know we can stop adding refinements . in a perturbation expansion",
    ", the amplitude @xmath105 for a given process can be computed using an expansion of the type [ 14 ] @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the coupling constant .",
    "in which follows we are going to see the effect of minimal length and maximal momentum as natural cutoffs on the scattering amplitude of the annihilation - creation process with spin-0 boson . in the presence of just a minimal measurable length as ultra - violet cutoff , momentum generalizes to @xmath108 .",
