    "the recent experiments by kim and chan @xcite on hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) solid @xmath0he have re - opened interest in the old question of supersolidity . in the 1970s , several theorists considered whether the formation of a bose - einstein condensate was possible in the presence of a crystalline lattice @xcite and leggett @xcite predicted a signature in the rotational inertia .",
    "kim and chan observed just such a shift , and this has subsequently been reproduced by several groups ( e.g.  ref .  ) , although the origin and mechanism of this effect remain under discussion .",
    "experimental estimates of the onset of this phenomenon range from between @xmath4 80 mk to 800 mk , dependent on the percentage of @xmath5he present.@xcite an acoustic anomaly was observed by ho _",
    "@xcite in the acoustic attenuation in solid @xmath0he crystals , close to 200 mk .",
    "this was ascribed to a change in the behaviour of defects in the crystal , and one school of thought holds that defects may play an important role in supersolid formation.@xcite    to provide information on the the bulk behavior of solid @xmath0he in this temperature range , we have carried out neutron diffraction experiments on solid @xmath0he crystals to look for traces of a supersolid transition in the bulk material .",
    "the neutron diffraction cross section is proportional to the square of the fourier transform of the nuclear density distribution in space and time .",
    "if the nuclei form a crystal lattice , then this fourier transform yields bragg peaks with an intensity that is proportional to the unit cell structure factor and the debye - waller factor , from which the mean square displacement of the @xmath0he nuclei can be extracted .",
    "helium forms a quantum crystal and so the mean square displacement is greater than the lindemann criterion due to large zero - point fluctuations.@xcite depending on the model used to describe supersolidity , this quantity is liable to change in the supersolid state . as an aside",
    ", we note that even non - solid samples may have a periodic density distribution and hence bragg peaks , and in this case , the effect on the mean square displacement would be even more significant .",
    "the he crystals were prepared in a cylindrical stainless steel sample chamber ( height 32.1 mm , diameter 33.5 mm ) equipped with quartz transducers to monitor ultrasound propagation through the growing crystal . @xmath0he",
    "gas was supplied and pressurized through a stainless steel capillary located at the top of the sample chamber .",
    "a mix containing a slightly elevated amount@xcite of @xmath5he ( 40 ppm ) was used . from ref .",
    "this should place the start of the transition temperature at @xmath4 550 mk , although the transition reported in ref .",
    "remains close to 200 mk .",
    "the sample chamber was cooled using an oxford instruments dilution refrigerator , wherein thermal contact to the mixing chamber was established using a cu wire attached to the bottom of the sample chamber .",
    "the sample chamber supported growth of multiple crystallites with different orientation as opposed to a single crystalline sample .",
    "the dilution refrigerator used for the measurements had difficulty cooling to 1 k when the filling capillary to the sample chamber was filled with liquid .",
    "therefore , the solid had to be formed at higher temperature and pressure .",
    "the sample examined here was formed by starting at pressure @xmath6 = 45 bar and temperature @xmath7 @xmath4 2 k. solid @xmath0he was then grown using the ` blocked capillary technique ' , in which a solid plug is formed in the capillary as the system is cooled so that the molar volume of the sample remains constant as it cools along the melting curve .",
    "this means that our sample passed through the region of bcc phase on the melting curve,@xcite which presumably contributed to the formation of strained crystallites .",
    "the neutron data were collected using the maps instrument at the isis facility , rutherford appleton laboratory , oxford .",
    "maps is a time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrometer equipped with approximately 16 m@xmath8 of position sensitive detectors located 6 m from the sample .",
    "the instrument was operated in tof laue mode with a white pulsed incident beam and the sample fixed in place .",
    "diffraction patterns were obtained over the temperature range 140 mk - 800 mk . at the end of the experiment",
    "the sample can was evacuated and an empty can measurement was acquired at 1 k. a standard vanadium sample was also measured to obtain information on the wavelength dependent detector efficiency .",
    "to assess the mean square displacement , multiple peaks from the same crystallite are required , preferably over a large range of momentum transfer .",
    "due to the presence of multiple crystallites in the sample can , it was impractical to identify peaks from the same crystallite at different locations on the detector .",
    "however , because we used a pulsed white incident beam , higher - order reflections from the same crystallite appeared in the same detector pixels , separated by the recorded time - of - flight . for these higher - order reflections to be visible , the principal reflection had to be sufficiently strong .",
    "45 reflections were indexed on the basis of their @xmath9-spacings , assuming an hcp structure .",
    "peaks of the types ( 002 ) , ( 100 ) , ( 101 ) and ( 102 ) were readily identified , but only peaks of the type ( 002 ) and ( 100 ) were strong enough for the corresponding higher - order reflections ( 004 ) and ( 200 ) to be visible at half the tof .",
    "the molar volume was determined using the range of plane spacings obtained at this point , even though the peaks were not from the same crystallites .",
    "we found @xmath10 = 3.68(1 )   and @xmath11 = 6.03(1 )  , corresponding to a molar volume of 21.3(1 ) @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath12 ratio is 1.638(5 ) as compared with the ideal hcp ratio of 1.633 .",
    "this is consistent with expectations from the temperature and pressure during the crystal growth process.@xcite    once these peaks were identified , the tof spectra in the corresponding pixels were normalized to the incident flux on the sample and the empty can measurement subtracted . at small momentum transfers , where the majority of scattering from the can and cryostat was found , a small amount of background scattering remained after this subtraction .",
    "an additional subtraction was made when integrating over reflections by taking a slice from the same pixel over a @xmath9-spacing range close to that of interest . at higher momentum transfers ,",
    "the initial subtraction is sufficient .",
    "the integrated intensities were then corrected for ( i ) angular effects , ( ii ) detector efficiency and ( iii ) the wavelength dependence of the incident beam flux . to establish the first correction factor , consider a diffraction peak with a scattering angle 2@xmath13 acquired on a 2d plate a distance @xmath14 (= 6.0031 m ) from the sample .",
    "the centre of the detector plate coincides with the centre of an orthonormal coordinate system where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are perpendicular directions in the plane of the detector , and @xmath17 is perpendicular to the plate .",
    "the reflection is observed at point ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) on the plate , and distance from the centre of the sample to this point is @xmath20 .",
    "the direction of the scattered beam can be expressed as a function of two angles , corresponding to the latitude and longitude ( labelled @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "using these angles , the position of the bragg peak is @xmath23 , keeping the @xmath24 coordinate system .",
    "the scattering vector @xmath25 is @xmath26 and so @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the magnitude of the wavevector .",
    "the number of neutrons counted in the bragg peak is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the incident flux on the sample ( neutrons / unit area / unit time ) , and @xmath31 is the solid angle subtended by the sample . we convert this to an integral form ; the solid angle can be written as @xmath32 .",
    "the incident flux can be written as a function of the incident wavelength - any variation from unity here is accounted for when the vanadium scans are considered . @xmath33 the neutron scattering cross - section is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of unit cells divided by the volume of a unit cell , and is particular to each crystallite , and @xmath36 is the structure factor of the bragg peak .",
    "we therefore arrive at the following expression for the intensity of the bragg peak at reciprocal lattice vector @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 integrating over momentum space , the bragg peak intensity is given by @xmath39 this expression applies equally to all of the detector banks .",
    "the value of @xmath40 for the main peaks was obtained by fitting the peak profile as a gaussian and taking the central value .",
    "this value was then halved for the relevant higher - order peak . to correct for the other factors ,",
    "the vanadium scan was used .",
    "vanadium is a uniform scatterer , and so @xmath41 where @xmath42 = @xmath43 m@xmath8 is the incoherent cross - section for vanadium,@xcite @xmath14 = 6.0031 m , and @xmath44 is the relevant area of the detector ( @xmath45 is the number of pixels ) . for one pixel @xmath46 = 0.025 m ( detector tube diameter ) and @xmath47 = 0.015",
    "m ( vertically resolvable distance ) .",
    "[ eq : ivana ] allows @xmath48 to be extracted from the white beam vanadaium diffraction data .    in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "the structure factor @xmath36 is related to the mean - square displacement as follows @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the position of the i@xmath51 atom in the unit cell , @xmath52 = 3.26@xmath53 m is the scattering length of @xmath54he,@xcite @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the displacement from the average periodic lattice for a specific nucleus.@xcite for the he hcp crystal , the lowest order expansion of the mean square displacement can be broken down into in - plane and out - of - plane ( @xmath57 to @xmath11 ) components , as follows @xmath58 previous studies have found this expression to be quite adequate for describing the observed data.@xcite    , of @xmath0he hcp crystal , as measured for the three selected peaks as a function of temperature.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    hcp he has two atoms per unit cell , and due to symmetry equivalence @xmath59 has no site dependence , and so can be pulled out of the summation over @xmath60 . after making these corrections , one finds that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the corrected intensity of each peak , and @xmath63 is the total correction factor , obtained from eqs .",
    "[ eq : imeas ] , [ eq : ivana ] and [ eq : ftau ] .",
    "we therefore have @xmath64 and so the mean square displacement can now be determined from a simple linear fit of intensity vs @xmath65 .    the level of thermal diffuse scattering , calculated following the method of popa and willis @xcite for tof neutron diffractometry , using the phonon velocities measured by minkiewicz _",
    "et al._,@xcite was found to be negligible .",
    "three peaks met the conditions established above , and values for @xmath66 were obtained at each temperature considered . figures [ fig : u2plot ] and [ fig : lnnplot ]",

    "@xmath66 is higher for the ( 00l ) peaks than for the ( h00 ) peaks indicating some anisotropy .",
    "the similar values of @xmath67 indicate similar crystallite sizes .",
    "consideration of the actual peak positions on the detector indicate that the second and third peaks are ( 100 ) type peaks that could be from the same crystallite , while the ( 002 ) type peak is from a different crystallite .",

    "although the lattice parameters for a given crystallite remained fairly stable as a function of temperature , due to different annealing conditions and difficulties with temperature stability between different runs , there was some change in the values obtained .",
    "this is most clearly obvious in the upper panel of figure [ fig : lattice_param ] , where two regimes are visible .",
    "the upper set of points , which differ from the rest by 1 part in 6000 , correspond to conditions where the stress on the crystallite was believed to be slightly different to that present for the other measured points .",
    "these changes had little impact on the observed mean square displacement , indicating that we are observing the ( temperature- and volume - independent ) zero - point motion here .",

    "we have observed a certain amount of anisotropy between in - plane and out - of - plane displacements . the in - plane value is 20 % smaller than the out - of - plane value , indicating that atomic motion is easier out - of - plane .",
