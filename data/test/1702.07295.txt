    "entanglement is one of the more interesting aspects of quantum mechanics due to the fact that there is no classical analog .",
    "entanglement has been demonstrated as a resource for quantum computational tasks such as teleportation @xcite and cryptography @xcite among many others . despite its relevance and the amount of attention being shown towards it ,",
    "entanglement remains a relative mystery .",
    "entanglement is generally difficult to study because the calculations become challenging as the dimension of the hilbert space increases . restricting those calculations to states which are symmetric under permutation of party labels",
    "greatly reduces the number of parameters and simplifies the calculations considerably .",
    "symmetric states are particularly useful for this reason . in addition ,",
    "symmetric states are relevant in many experimental settings such as in measurement - based quantum computing @xcite and as an initial state for grover s algorithm @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the restriction to symmetric states is used to simplify the calculation of 3 qubit local unitary invariants .",
    "the entanglement of an @xmath3 qubit state , as defined by any measure , remains invariant under local unitary operators of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the set of polynomial invariant quantities of a multi - qubit state are not limited to entanglement measures , however . in this paper , the invariants of an arbitrary three qubit symmetric state are calculated explicitly and their full achievable region is calculated .",
    "any multi - particle state has a set of polynomials in the coefficients of the state which are invariant under the action of various local operators @xcite . in particular , a 3 qubit state , under the action of unitaries which act only locally on one qubit ,",
    "is known to have 5 algebraically independent invariants ( excepting the trace norm and @xmath7 invariants ) @xcite .",
    "one is free to chose the representation of the 5 invariants , as any polynomial in the invariants is additionally an invariant of the state .",
    "one representation that is particularly convenient for 3 qubit states under local unitary operators is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the pairwise concurrence between parties",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath1 is the 3-tangle @xcite , and @xmath2 is the kempe invariant @xcite .",
    "these quantities are defined for a 3 qubit state , @xmath12 , as follows ,    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    where the @xmath16 in ( 2 ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the reduced density operator of the state having traced out all parties other than @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "note , also , that in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we have adopted the convention of summing over repeated indices .",
    "this choice of invariants is particularly useful as it uses some of the most prevalent entanglement measures in the concurrence and 3-tangle .",
    "it s natural to consider entanglement measures as invariants since by definition they should not change under local operations",
    ".    it would be interesting to completely map the space of these 5 invariants , but the calculations are difficult for arbitrary states , and the 5 dimensional picture would be unwieldy to describe . instead , by examining a particular subset of states , the number of parameters and invariants can be reduced to a more manageable amount . in the next section",
    "this is done for the subset of states which are symmetric under permutation of the party labels .",
    "symmetric states offer a significant simplification to the picture of 3 qubit invariants .",
    "clearly if a state is symmetric under relabeling of parties , each of the two - party reduced density operators , @xmath18 , will be identical .",
    "this then causes @xmath19 and effectively reduces the number of invariants to 3 , which will be denoted ,      the goal now is to calculate these invariants for a general 3 qubit symmetric state and describe the space of allowed values for these invariants . before doing so , however , we can further simplify the problem by examining how the symmetric subspace of 3 qubit states reduces the parameters on which the invariants depend .",
    "are the dicke basis states which represent an equal superposition of all possible states with @xmath10 `` 0 '' entries and @xmath23 `` 1 '' entries .",
    "they are obviously symmetric since @xmath24 permutes the parties of the state and the sum is an equal superposition of all possible permutations . in this representation ,",
    "the 3 qubit symmetric state has 4 complex coefficients , @xmath25 , which reduce to 6 real parameters after normalization and the factoring out of an overall phase .",
    "while the invariants can be calculated from these 6 real parameters , it s useful to apply a set of local unitaries to the state to reduce the number of parameters .",
    "the calculation of the invariants then becomes more concise while still containing the same information since the invariants should not change under local unitaries .",
    "such a simplification was investigated in [ 11 ] .",
    "using almost the same argument , we show in the following that an arbitrary 3 qubit symmetric state is equivalent under local unitaries to the state            one can compute the majorana polynomial @xcite of @xmath33 , by projecting it onto the unnormalized coherent state @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an arbitrary complex number .",
    "the resulting inner product is the following polynomial in @xmath35 ,      by the first fundamental theorem of algebra , the roots of this polynomial , @xmath37 , known as the majorana roots , uniquely determine the coefficients @xmath25 up to some overall scaling factor .",
    "so to show that two states are the same , it suffices to show that they have the same majorana roots .",
    "we will exploit this fact to show that @xmath33 can be represented as      where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 by showing that ( 11 ) has the same majorana roots as ( 9 ) for some choice of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . before computing the majorana roots of ( 11 )",
    ", we can factor out @xmath44 from the state to express it as ,              where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the goal is to demonstrate that one can solve for a choice of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that will satisfy ( 14 ) having the same roots as ( 10 ) .",
    "this creates the following constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,          equations ( 15 - 17 ) provide sufficient constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath53 to identify a representation ( 11 ) which is the same state as ( 9 ) .",
    "one can then construct a local unitary operator of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . applying this to ( 12 ) results in",
    ",                this canonical form is a useful tool in examining the local unitary invariants of 3-qubit symmetric states .",
    "other canonical forms and representations for 3-qubit states are known , but this one provides considerable simplification to symmetric states in particular and leaves them symmetric after the rotation . if one were to transform ( 20 ) into one of the general 3-qubit canonical forms developed by acn et .",
    "al . in @xcite",
    "one would get the following state ,        returning to ( 20 ) , it s clear that in this form an arbitrary 3 qubit symmetric state depends entirely on the three real parameters , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in terms of these parameters ,",
    "the invariants are ,        it s interesting then to examine the space of allowed invariants . shown in figure 1",
    "are the invariants of @xmath71 randomly generated symmetric 3 qubit states , where the states were generated by sampling randomly over the allowed values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "at a first glance it s interesting to note that the 3-tangle and kempe invariants achieve their maximum values of 1 on the symmetric subspace , but the concurrence does not due its monogamy constraints .",
    "a straightforward maximization over the state parameters reveals a maximum concurrence of @xmath72 in the symmetric subspace .",
    "the points of figure 1 appear to lie almost on a surface , but closer inspection reveals they in fact fill a narrow volume , the boundaries to which can be calculated .",
    "the expressions , ( 22 - 24 ) , can be inverted to find the parameters , @xmath66 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 as functions of the invariants by a grbner basis calculation .",
    "the constraints on the state parameters then provide constraints on these function of the invariants .",
    "the extrema of these constraints are the surfaces which form the boundaries of the invariant space .",
    "the boundaries are formed when equality is achieved in the following relations .",
    "these three surfaces , which are shown in figure 2 , form boundaries for the possible space of the invariants .",
    "note that the state parameter constraints lead to more constraints on the invariants , but ( 25 - 27 ) are the minimum set of constraints required to describe the region .",
    "because there is a bijective map between the invariants and the state parameters , each invariant triple which lies within the region satisfying ( 25 - 27 ) can be mapped to a 3 qubit symmetric state , and therefor the entire region is achievable .",
    "a similar approach could be used to analyze the the invariants of @xmath3 qubits for the symmetric subspace .",
    "the representation in @xcite extends to symmetric @xmath3 qubit states resulting in @xmath76 real parameters .",
    "3 qubits , in particular , can be fully analyzed and visualized because the numbers of invariants and state parameters are suitably low .",
    "additionally , the 3 qubit case conveniently resulted in an invertible map between the state parameters and the invariants , making the calculation of the region more manageable .",
    "turning to the @xmath3 qubit case , it would be interesting to identify an algebraically independent set of @xmath76 polynomial invariants for symmetric states .",
    "those invariants could potentially then be calculated in terms of the @xmath76 state parameters .",
    "the fact that this map was invertible in 3 qubits is remarkable , and will not necessarily be true for the @xmath3 qubit case , though it it certainly worth examining .",
