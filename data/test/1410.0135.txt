    "the highly variable x - ray emission from black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) shows a variety of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) that appear as peaks of small but finite widths in the power density spectra ( pds ) .",
    "these qpos can be grouped in three categories  ( @xmath9 )",
    "high frequency qpos that occur in the frequency range of @xmath10 and are generally transient ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( @xmath11 ) low frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) in the range of @xmath12 @xcite , ( iii ) very low frequency ( @xmath13 ) qpos that have been observed in the heart - beat sources grs  1915 + 105 @xcite and igr  j170913624 .",
    "recently , mhz qpos have also been detected from the bhbs h  1743322 ( @xmath14 ; @xcite ) and ic  x1 ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) .",
    "some ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) also show very low frequency qpos at @xmath16 , e.g. , m  82  x1 @xcite , ngc  5408  x1 @xcite , although they could be the counterpart of lfqpos if these ulxs contain intermediate mass black holes .",
    "the lfqpos come in varieties with three main types ",
    "type a ( weak with a few percent rms and broad peak around @xmath17 ) , type b ( relatively strong with @xmath18 rms and narrow peak around @xmath19 ) and type c ( strong up to @xmath20 rms , narrow and variable peak ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the exact origin of qpos from bhbs is still a mystery , the type c lfqpos are correlated with energy spectral properties .",
    "the centroid frequency is found to be correlated with the disk flux @xcite , and the rms amplitude is found to increase with energy .",
    "it implies that the lfqpos do not directly arise from the thermal accretion disk as the accretion disk emission does not extend to higher energies .",
    "the evolution of black hole transients can be characterized in terms of a limited number of states viz .",
    "low - hard state ( lhs ) , hard intermediate state ( hims ) , soft intermediate state ( sims ) , high soft state ( hss ) , and the transitions between these states .",
    "the lhs is characterised by a strong dominant power - law emission with a variable slope ( @xmath21 ) correlated with flux and a high - energy cutoff , also variable between 60 and 120 kev ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the hims ,",
    "a softer component originating from a thermal accretion disk component contributes more to the observed emission and the power law component steepens , with an increase in the high energy cutoff value @xcite . the sims is softer than the hims due to larger contribution of the disk emission and is characterised by low level ( @xmath22a few @xmath23 rms ) of variability @xcite .",
    "the lhs is usually associated with a steady radio - jet ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the hims ,",
    "a type - c lfqpo is always observed , as is often the case in the brightest lhs . in the sims , qpos of type a or b",
    "are often observed .",
    "in contrast , lfqpos are generally not observed in the hss dominated by thermal emission from accretion disks .    hard x - ray irradiation of the thermal accretion disk can give rise to x - ray fluorescence emission lines below @xmath24 and compton reflection hump in the @xmath25 band . the iron k@xmath1 emission line , broadened by doppler and gravitational effects near a black hole in x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ,",
    "is proven to be one of the most important diagnostic of the inner most regions of strong gravity .",
    "the strength and extent of the red wing of the relativistic iron line is determined by the inner extent of the accretion disk which is smaller than @xmath26 if the black hole is spinning , where @xmath27 is the gravitational radius . for a maximally spinning black hole ,",
    "the innermost stable circular orbit is @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , the presence of broad iron lines in the x - ray spectra of both black hole x - ray binaries and agn have been used to determine the size of the inner disk and from that to infer the black hole spin .",
    "the production of a broad iron line depends both on the presence of an accretion disk extending to the innermost regions and a strong hard x - ray continuum illuminating the disk .",
    "the presence of lfqpos also depends on the power - law component .",
    "this suggests that the iron k@xmath1 line and lfqpos are likely related though not directly . in the soft spectral states , strong iron k lines",
    "are usually not observed , due to lack of strong hard x - ray continuum .",
    "similarly , lfqpos are not observed in the high / soft states .",
    "the relationship between the broad iron line and the lfqpos , their dependence on the hard x - ray continuum and the presence of an accretion disk are good tests of disk / corona geometry and the models for the origin of both the iron line and lfqpos .",
    "lmc  x1 , located in the large magellanic cloud , is a luminous and persistent black hole x - ray binary ( bhb ) .",
    "it consists of a @xmath29 black hole primary and an o7  iii companion orbiting each other with a @xmath30-day period @xcite .",
    "the companion drives a strong wind that powers the black hole with an average luminosity of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "lmc  x1 has remained in the hss persistently and has never been observed to undergo a transition to the lhs @xcite .",
    "the temporal properties of lmc  x-1 are typical of hss with its pds approximately proportional to @xmath32 and fractional root mean square variability ( rms ) of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "previously , two qpos at @xmath34 and @xmath35 have been reported from lmc  x1 , based on _ ginga _ observations @xcite . however , a series of nine _ rxte _ observations performed in 1996 @xcite and a long @xmath36 _ rxte _",
    "observation @xcite did not detect any qpo from the source .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath37 and @xmath35 qpos detected by @xcite is likely an artifact due to incorrect estimation of the poisson noise level @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of lmc  x1 is typical of the hss in which the thermal disk component dominates over the power - law component @xcite however , spectral evolution of lmc  x1 does not follow the modified stefan - boltzmann relation @xmath38 expected from the hss of bhbs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of broad iron line from lmc  x1 , earlier inferred from _ rxte _",
    "observations @xcite , has been confirmed by @xcite who measured a spin @xmath39 using _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "@xcite also found a strong correlation between the relative strength of the compton power law and the iron line flux using the _ rxte _ observations .    in this paper ,",
    "we perform timing and spectral study of lmc  x1 based on _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations and report the detection of @xmath40 qpos and variable broad iron line .",

    "the epic - pn camera was operated in timing mode using the thick optical blocking filter in 2000 october and thin filter in 2002 september .",
    "the mos cameras were operated in the full frame mode using the medium optical blocking filter in both observations .",
    "we used sas version 12.0 and the most recent calibration database to process and filter the event data .",
    "we corrected the epic - pn event list for the rate - dependent charge transfer inefficiency which has been seen in the fast mode data .",
    "we checked for particle background by extracting lightcurves above @xmath24 from both epic - pn and mos data .",
    "no flaring background was found in the xmm-101 data . in the xmm-401 data ,",
    "the flaring particle background was present in the beginning of observation for a short interval of @xmath43 and after an elapsed time of @xmath44 .",
    "we excluded these intervals of high particle background by using good time intervals created based on count rate cutoff criteria .",
    "we extracted the @xmath45 light curve from the epic - pn data and created a gti file by selecting the intervals with the count rate @xmath46 .",
    "we then applied the gti file and filtered the event list for high particle background .",
    "this resulted in the net exposures of @xmath47 for the xmm-401 observation .",

    "the data are collapsed into one - dimensional row of size 64 pixels or @xmath48 and are continuously transferred along the second dimension and readout at high speed resulting in @xmath49 time resolution .",
    "this allows for high count rates and photon pile - up is negligible below @xmath50 .",

    "we then added a model for a lorentzian - shaped qpo for the @xmath220.03 hz narrow feature .",

    "the qpo is detected at much higher ( @xmath83 ) significance level and the qpo parameters remained similar . for xmm-101 , we found that the constant+plaw model adequately describes the pds ( @xmath84 ) without any requirement for a qpo .",
    "we calculated an upper - limit on the @xmath2 of a possible qpo by adding a qpo model .",
    "we fixed the qpo frequency and the quality factor to the best - fit values obtained for the xmm-401 data and varied the qpo normalization .",

    "next we replaced the laor line with reflionx convolved with kdblur ( model c ) with emissivity index fixed at @xmath255 .",

    "these values are generally consistent with earlier measurements . using six soft x - ray spectra obtained with grating and/or ccd , measured @xmath261 for the diskbb@xmath204simpl model and @xmath262 for the diskbb@xmath203powerlaw model , with a systematic dependence on the orbital phase .",
    "earlier measurements with _",
    "chandra _ , _ bepposax _ , _ asca _ and _ bbxrt _ span a range of @xmath263 ( see table  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed power and energy spectral study of the persistent bhb lmc  x1 .",
    "the pds shape of lmc  x1 as measured with _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ is approximately a power - law ( @xmath264 ; @xmath265 ) , with rms variability of @xmath266 ( xmm-101 ) , @xmath267 ( xmm-401 ) and @xmath268 ( _ suzaku _ ) in the @xmath269 range .",
    "these values are generally consistent with earlier measurements by _ ginga _ @xcite , _ rxte _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and typical of a hss .",
    "we have discovered qpos from lmc  x1 at around @xmath270 in _ xmm - newton _ ( xmm-401 ) and _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "these qpos appear to be remarkable as their centroid frequencies are very low compared to that of a , b or c - type qpos observed from black hole transients in outburst .",
    "additionally , they appear in the hss when qpos are usually not observed .",
    "the quality factor of these qpos ( @xmath271 for xmm-401 , @xmath272 for _ suzaku _ data ) are comparable to that of type b or c qpos and the rms ( @xmath273 ) are comparable to type a qpos . however , the frequencies are much lower than that observed from type a and b qpos , and the very low frequency type c qpos are seen only in hard states , much different from what we observe here .",
    "there are very few qpos from the persistent and wind - fed bhb . in the case of lmc",
    "x1 , @xcite claimed detection of qpos at @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath274 and @xmath275 rms , respectively , based on _ ginga _ observations .",
    "the weaker qpo is likely to be the second harmonic .",
    "thus , the frequencies of the qpos discovered with _ ginga _ are higher but the @xmath2 of these qpos are within the range of those measured with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "it is likely that all these qpos are similar in nature but vary in their peak frequencies .",
    "the x - ray energy spectrum of lmc  x1 is dominated by two spectral components  accretion disk black body and a comptonising component or a steep power - law as was also noted earlier ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we have confirmed the broad , relativistic iron line from lmc  x1 in the _ suzaku _ data , earlier studied in detail by @xcite who measured the black hole spin parameter @xmath276 ( @xmath277 range ) .",
    "we measure the inner radius to be @xmath278 , which corresponds to a similar spin parameter though we used a simpler model .",
    "in addition , we also detected broad iron line in one of the _ xmm - newton _ observation ( xmm-401 ) .",
    "however , the line was narrower ( @xmath279 ) and weaker by at least an order of magnitude compared to the relativistic line measured with the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "we did not detect an iron line in the xmm-101 observation .",
    "the @xmath70 upper limit on the flux of a laor line at @xmath280 with @xmath281 ( similar to the line in the xmm-401 data ) is @xmath282 .",
    "this @xmath70 limit on the iron line flux is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the line flux measured in the _ suzaku _ data but it is formally consistent with the @xmath70 range measured with the xmm-401 data . in any case , the iron line from lmc  x1 is variable and is only detected clearly when a strong power - law component is present .",
    "we have also found strong variability of the power - law component in the energy spectrum . in the first _ xmm - newton _ observation ( xmm-101 ) ,",
    "the power - law component is almost absent . in this observation ,",
    "the fraction of the disk emission in the @xmath218 was @xmath283 and lmc  x1 was in the soft state . in the second _ xmm - newton _",
    "( xmm-401 ) and the _ suzaku _ observations , the power - law component was very strong with disk fractions @xmath284 and @xmath285 , respectively , in the @xmath218 band ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : spec_par ] ) .",
    "the spectral variability of lmc  x1 is also well studied .",
    "@xcite showed that spectral variability of lmc  x1 mainly arises from the changes in the intensity of the high - energy power - law component .",
    "the clear presence of the broad iron line as well as the qpos in the x - ray emission from lmc  x1 appear to depend on the presence of a strong power - law component .",
    "the qpos must arise from the inner regions where substantial x - ray variability is produced . indeed , there are theoretical models that show oscillations in the inner regions of accretion disks .",
    "@xcite have shown that the very low frequency qpos in both bhb and ns xrbs are caused by global disk oscillations in the direction normal to the disk .",
    "they argue that these disk oscillations are the result of gravitational interaction between the compact object and the accretion disk .",
    "the frequency of the global disk oscillations can be written as @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "using @xmath287 , @xmath288 @xcite , @xmath289 from the broad iron line fit to the _ suzaku _ data ( see table  [ tab : spec_par ] ) , and the adjustment radius @xmath290 @xcite , we find @xmath291 .",
    "thus , the global disk oscillations are @xmath292 times faster than the observed qpos . hence , the global mode oscillations are unlikely to explain the observed qpos from lmc  x1 .",
    "very low frequency qpos in the @xmath40 range have been observed from bhbs e.g. , the dynamic qpos in the @xmath293 range changing their frequency on minutes @xcite , the `` heartbeat '' qpos from grs  1915 + 105 and igr  j170913624 @xcite . the millihertz heartbeat qpos from grs  1915 + 105 and igr  j170913624 occur during the high - luminosity , soft - states and",
    "are thought to be due to limit - cycle oscillations of local accretion rate in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "the millihertz qpos from lmc  x1 are also detected in the high luminosity ( @xmath294 ) with strong soft component .",
    "however , the scattering fraction ( @xmath295 ; @xcite ) of grs  1915 + 105 during the heartbeat oscillation appears to be higher than the averaged scattering fraction @xmath296 we found in the presence of qpo for lmc  x1 .",
    "also @xmath2 amplitude of the qpos from lmc  x1 are low ( @xmath297 ) compared to the @xmath2 amplitude of the hearbeat qpos from grs  1915 + 105 , though the amplitude can be as low as @xmath298 in the case of igr  j170913624 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the hearbeat oscillations in the @xmath299 and @xmath300 classes of grs  1915 + 105 and igr  j170913624 generally depict a peculiar pattern  slow rise and fast decay with changes in the count rates by factors @xmath301 . though it is difficult to infer the pattern of individual variability events , such large amplitude variability are not seen in the lightcurves of lmc  x1 .",
    "thus , the @xmath302 qpos from lmc  x1 are unlikely to be the `` heartbeat '' qpos",
    ".    very low frequency , `` non - heartbeat '' oscillations have also been found in bhbs .",
    "@xcite have reported @xmath303 qpos from the black hole candidate h  1743322 in its successive outbursts eight months apart .",
    "these qpos were almost constant in their peak frequency and were detected in the lhs state of h  1743322 . given the differences in the spectral states and luminosity of lmc  x1 and h  1743322 , it is likely that the qpos from these two sources arise from different physical phenomena .",
    "the qpos we detected from lmc  x1 are in the same frequency range as those observed in some ulxs , where there are attempts to identify them in order to scale with mass .",
    "if these are the same features , ulxs would host a black hole of a few solar masses .",
    "the @xmath40 qpos from lmc  x1 are the only low frequency qpos from any persistent , wind - fed bhb . a detailed study of the these qpos and their dependence on energy , broadband energy spectral and pds shape",
    ", absorption will be required to investigate their nature .",
    "the variable nature of these qpos and the broad iron line from lmc  x1 possibly related to strength of the power - law component can be used to study the disk - corona coupling and the origin of both these features .",
    "the _ astrosat _ mission , scheduled to launch in a year , is well suited for detailed study of these qpos .",
