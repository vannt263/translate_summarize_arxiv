    "the seeds of the present - day large scale structure of the universe are formed from random gaussian density fluctuations in the early stages of its evolution . in these random density fluctuations , matter evolves from a linear to a highly nonlinear regime driven by gravitational instabilities .",
    "these instabilities in the primordial gaussian density field form the complex structure of the universe that we observe today . as a result",
    ", it is natural to describe the probability distribution function of the density fluctuations as a crucial statistical tool to identify different types of environments of the universe .",
    "for example , a gaussian matter distribution function represents the linear regime , while the distribution function that deviates from gaussian shows a highly nonlinear regime . in this framework",
    ", there are two important building blocks of the large scale structure ; galaxies / overdense regions and voids / underdense regions .",
    "initially these two features are formed from the same primordial gaussian density field .",
    "while voids are formed from the minima of the density field , galaxies are formed in the density maxima . in time when galaxies grow in mass , voids tend to empty in their mass due to their peculiar gravitational force through the nonlinear regime .",
    "although there are different phenomenological models of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of overdense regions ( such as galaxies , galaxy clusters, .. etc . ) in nonlinear regimes @xcite , the statistical models of void probability functions ( vpfs ) @xcite are based on the counts in randomly placed cells following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "in addition to this vpf , the number density of voids is another key statistic to obtain the void distribution .",
    "@xcite show that this number density can be estimated analytically by using numerical simulations or mock catalogues .",
    "the phenomenological models of pdfs of overdense regions , especially the one - point and the two - point pdfs , are well studied .",
    "the two - point pdf is a tool to model the dark halo biasing as well as obtaining the errors in the one - point statistics @xcite while the one - point pdf is a useful tool to show the clustering of the universe with higher order moments - statistics such as skewness and kurtosis @xcite .",
    "observations as well as models based on cold dark matter numerical simulations of galaxy distributions indicate that the density distribution is well approximated by a log - normal rather than a gaussian one @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite show that the pdf computed from perturbation theory in a weakly nonlinear regime approaches log - normal when the primordial power spectrum is proportional to index @xmath1 .",
    "later on , @xcite find the one - point log - normal pdf can describe the density distributions accurately , not only in weakly nonlinear , but also in the highly nonlinear regime by using the nonlinear density fluctuations from @xmath2-body simulations with gaussian initial conditions .",
    "@xcite also indicate that this pdf is fairly independent of the shape and the power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "however the underlying mechanism of the cosmological origin of the log - normal distribution remains unknown .",
    "in this study we determine that a specific standard parametric model can fit samples of void radii from the cosmic void catalog ( cvc ) of @xcite after suitable estimation of the parameters in the model .",
    "the three mock catalogs under study , referred to by the nicknames given in the cvc , are n - body mock , hod sparse and hod dense . using these samples",
    "we show that the system of @xmath0-parameter log - normal distribution provides a fairly satisfactory model of the size distribution of voids which is strikingly similar to the galaxy mass distribution of @xcite , assuming the void size is proportional to its mass content ( @xmath3 ) . to do this ,",
    "we follow three standard steps in the statistical analysis .",
    "these are the exploratory phase , the choice of a probability model , estimations of the parameters of the model and finally the graphical and numerical assessment ( see chapter 4  section 4.1 and 4.2 in @xcite and the introduction in @xcite for an overview of basic principles and some terminology employed in the fields of descriptive statistics , estimation and goodness - of - fit procedures ) .",
    "to investigate the void size distribution function statistically in simulations , here we use the public cvc of @xcite .",
    "cvc has two main catalogs : a complete catalog that is suitable for void galaxy surveys , and a bias - free catalog of voids that provides a fair sampling of void shapes and alignments in which the void effective radii vary between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "all the data samples we use here from cvc are generated from a @xmath7 cold dark matter ( @xmath7cdm ) n - body simulation by using an adaptive treecode n - body method called the 2hot code @xcite .",
    "@xcite extract halos from the n - body simulation , and use the position and masses of halos to produce a hod model .",
    "therefore , galaxy catalogues are produced from a halo population by using the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) code of @xcite and the hod model by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite generate three mock catalogs ; hod dense , hod sparse and n - body mock . in these catalogs ,",
    "voids are identified with by the modified version of the parameter - free void finder zobov @xcite .",
    "hod dense and hod sparse are produced by dark matter simulations of @xmath8 particles in a @xmath9 gpc / h box and all particles are kept in real space at @xmath10 and are tuned to the observational hod fits @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the difference between these two catalogs comes from their resolution as well as their tuned observational data sets .",
    "hod sparse mock catalog consists of @xmath11 voids with @xmath12 @xmath6 effective minimum radii ( @xmath13 @xmath6 ) and",
    "this void catalog represents a relatively low resolution galaxy sample with density @xmath14 particles per cubic @xmath6 matching the number density and clustering of the sdss dr@xmath15 galaxy sample @xcite using the parameters found by @xcite ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 chosen to fit the mean number density ) .",
    "hod dense catalog has @xmath22 voids with effective minimum radii @xmath23 mpc / h and includes relatively high - resolution galaxy samples with density @xmath24 dark matter particles per cubic mpc / h matching the sdss dr@xmath25 main sample @xcite using one set of parameters found by @xcite ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "n - body mock catalog is a single hod mock in real space at @xmath30 , generated by a dark matter simulation of @xmath31 particles ( with a particle mass resolution @xmath32 @xmath33 in a @xmath34 gpc / h box and is tuned to sdss dr@xmath15 in full cubic volume by using the hod parameters found in @xcite . although n - body mock catalog is processed slightly differently than hod sparse and hod dense , it is a hod mock catalog and it uses planck first- year cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the n - body mock consists of @xmath35 voids @xcite .",
    "it is particularly important to mention that both the n - body mock and hod sparse , represent voids generated from the relative low density galaxy mocks , while hod dense consists of void populations generated from a relatively high density galaxy mock catalog . as a result",
    ", these samples may help us to identify some possible relations between the void size distribution and the environment .",
    "here we take into account maximum tree depth as an indicator of an environment .",
    "note that the maximum tree depth is the length from root to tip of the tallest tree in the hierarchy as is defined by @xcite , and it shows the amount of substructures in the most complex void @xcite . according to this , the hod dense and sparse",
    "have the maximum three depths @xmath36 and @xmath34 , respectively @xcite , while n - body mock shows only the root voids , at the base of the tree hierarchy , and therefore they do not have parents which indicates that the maximum three depth of this sample @xmath37 @xcite .    here the samples hod sparse , hod dense and n - body mock are denoted as @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "while @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) represent the names of the samples , @xmath43 stand for data points .",
    "the first step in the exploratory phase consists of examining the basic graphical and numerical indicators of the samples as histograms , parameters of location ( range , mean , median and mode ) or dispersion ( standard deviation ) and shape ( skewness , kurtosis ) .",
    "let us first consider the raw data plots .",
    "informative features appear from a cursory inspection of the histograms . whereas those of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( see figure 3 ) present the features of samples drawn from a single parent population , an unexpected local mode occurs in @xmath46 about the value @xmath47 mpc / h , see figure 1 left panel .",
    "this suggests that n - body mock , @xmath46 , should be usefully considered as a sample drawn not from a single population but from two or more void populations with different central density values . in other words",
    "it is reasonable to perform a task of classification .",
    "the latter is meant in the classical sense in mathematical statistics , as , e.g. , in  44.1 of @xcite ) ; it consists of differentiating between two or more populations on the basis of multivariate measurements .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "today we know that voids dominate the total observed volume of the large scale structure @xcite and they are very sensitive to their environments which can strongly affect their shape as well their distributions @xcite .",
    "therefore the void size distribution functions may play an important role to understand the dynamical processes affecting the structure formation of the universe @xcite .    in this study , we show that the system of @xmath0-parameter log - normal distributions gives a satisfactory model of the size distribution of voids obtained from the three different hod mock catalogs of cvc ; n - body mock , hod sparse and hod dense .",
    "these catalogs are especially important since they may allow us to compare hod mock voids in different environments . as aforementioned , hod dense and hod sparse",
    "provide us the data sets to obtain the size distributions at @xmath10 @xcite , while n - body mock catalog has @xmath35 voids at @xmath30 in the full volume - set of mock galaxies @xcite .",
    "we find that n - body mock catalog , @xmath46 , show sub - void populations with respect to their central densities ( left panel , figure 1 ) . from these sub - populations",
    "we choose the population includes voids with only zero central density .",
    "this sub - sample is named as @xmath48 which consists of @xmath49 voids and the maximum tree depth @xmath37 . the size distribution obtained from this",
    "sub - sample satisfies the @xmath0-parameter log - normal distribution as other catalogs .",
    "as is seen , this sub - sample has the smallest value of the maximum tree depth compared to the two catalogs we use in this study .",
    "this is especially important since it provides us a third environment to compare the relationship between the maximum tree depth and the two shape parameters of the log - normal size distribution .",
    "then , we compare the void size distributions obtained from these mock data . as a result",
    ", we show that all three samples fit the @xmath0-parameter log - normal distribution .",
    "as is seen in fig 2 and table 3 , the hod sparse sample , @xmath44 remarkably passes the kolmogorov , cramr - von mises and anderson - darling statistical test with high p - value of @xmath50 , which seldom occurs with a large size sample .    recalling that skewness @xmath51 of the log - normal distribution indicates the asymmetry of the void size distribution , in fig 2 , table 3 , 4 and 5 , hod dense @xmath45 , is the most asymmetric sample with the skewness @xmath52 compared to the void populations in n - body mock , @xmath48 with @xmath53 and hod sparse , @xmath44 with @xmath54 (",
    "also see table 1 to compare other parameters of the void size distributions between the three samples ) . also , the void size distribution of n - body mock @xmath48 is the least asymmetric of the three samples .",
    "in addition , we find that the void distribution in hod dense indicates higher kurtosis , @xmath55 than the void population in the hod sparse sample , @xmath56 , while the n - body mock sub - sample shows the lowest kurtosis @xmath57 . as is seen that there may be a relation between the values of kurtosis , skewness and the maximum tree depth of the void size distribution .",
    "note that hod dense has the highest maximum tree depth @xmath36 as well as the highest values of the kurtosis @xmath55 and skewness @xmath52 of the three samples , while the size distribution obtained from the n - body mock sub - sample @xmath48 consists of the lowest values of the distribution shape parameters ( @xmath53 and @xmath57 ) and the maximum tree depth @xmath37 taking into account only the root voids .",
    "considering that the maximum tree depth is a measure of the amount of void substructures , it may be possible to determine a connection between the number of void substructures and how the void size distribution is skewed and peaked .",
    "note that all the void size distributions have positive skewness and the strength of the skewness may be related to the length of the tail of the distribution in radius ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "in addition , it is natural to see a thin tail due to the shape of the log - normal distribution in any case .",
    "for example , hod dense ( @xmath45 ) and hod sparse ( @xmath44 ) show slightly longer tails on the large radius side compared to the distribution of the n - body mock sub - sample ( @xmath48 ) which has the smallest skewness ( table 1 and figure 3 ) .",
    "these thin tail formations of the log - normal void size distributions derived from the simulations are particularly interesting due to a possible connection of dynamical interplay between void size and galaxy distributions . assuming the void size is proportional to its mass content ( @xmath3 )",
    ", we here realized that the one - point galaxy distribution obtained by @xcite from the n - body simulations seems strikingly similar to the log - normal void distribution that we obtain ( see equation ( [ eqn : void - distribution ] ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , the void log - normal distribution has one more additional parameter than the galaxy distribution of @xcite which provides a better fit to the void data sets . from small to large scale matter distributions in the universe , in other words from the interstellar to the intergalactic medium , there are models and observational studies to explain the skewed log - normal matter distribution .",
    "for example , @xcite conclude that statistical density fluctuations , intermittency , and magnetic fields can cause excess from the log - normal distribution , and also that core formation and/or global collapse of filaments and a non - isothermal gas distribution lead to a power - law tail .",
    "@xcite show that the observed skewed log - normal galaxy distribution could arise from repeated shock interactions , without the need for fully - developed turbulence .",
    "recently it has been shown that it is possible to see large scale bulk flows which indicate that the possibility of the effects of large scale turbulence on structure formation may not be ignored .",
    "related to this , @xcite find a large - scale bulk flow of approximately a sphere of radius @xmath58 @xmath6 produced by the massive structures associated with the sdss great wall .",
    "taking into account that voids and galaxies / overdensities are formed from the same primordial density field , then the similarity between the void size and galaxy mass distributions may be expected . as a result , it is possible that the galaxy and void distributions are analogous to each other .",
    "this analogy may be caused by void substructures due to the inner as well as outer tidal streams since it is shown that the interiors of voids are filled with subvoids , galaxies and even filaments by @xmath2-body simulations and observations @xcite .",
    "note that proving this connection between void and galaxy mass distribution deserves its own systematic statistical study , especially by using real data sets , therefore we leave the answer of this puzzle to a future study .",
    "in addition to this , the peaks of the distributions is given by @xmath59 in table 1 .",
    "@xmath59 provides the most dominant void sizes in the void size distribution .",
    "figure 3 and tables 1 show that @xmath60 @xmath6 size voids dominate the hod sparse sample , @xmath44 , while the size distributions of the hod dense @xmath45 and the n - body mock @xmath48 are dominated by voids with radii @xmath61 @xmath6 and @xmath62 @xmath6 respectively .",
    "this indicates that the size distributions of hod sparse and the n - body mock sub - sample tends to have larger voids compared to the voids in hod dense due to their low density environment .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite . on the other hand , as aforementioned , the n - body mock catalog has higher redshift @xmath30 than the two other samples , therefore n - body mock sample may imply larger size voids at @xmath10 compared to hod sparse .",
    "although there are some theoretical attempts to understand the dynamical , thermal and chemical evolution of the void population , and the interplay between galaxies and the intergalactic medium @xcite , a systematic investigation of void size distributions is still missing . therefore , in this study we show that the void size distributions satisfy the @xmath0-parameter log - normal distribution and this distribution may be a good candidate to show the large scale environmental effects on voids .",
    "it also seems that there is a relation between the strength of the maximum tree depth and the @xmath0-parameter log - normal void size distribution parameters ; skewness and kurtosis . on the other hand ,",
    "an extended statistical study of the size distribution of voids in real as well as more simulated data is crucial to fully understand the effects of the large scale dynamical network between galaxies , filaments and voids to obtain more precise results .",
