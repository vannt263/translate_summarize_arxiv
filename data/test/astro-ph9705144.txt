    "in this contribution , we describe calculations of the signatures of the first generation of stars from high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "our approach is to combine current data on cdm cosmologies and star  formation in the most straightforward way .",
    "the standard hierarchical structure formation models predict the abundance of virialized clouds as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "the first of these clouds appear with a low mass ( @xmath8 ) at redshifts as high as @xmath9 ; objects with successively higher masses assemble later ( cf .",
    "haiman , thoul , & loeb and references therein ) .",
    "such objects are the most natural sites for the formation of the first generation of stars .",
    "although it is not known how star  formation in these objects proceeds , a necessary requirement for continued post  virialization collapse and fragmentation is that the gas can cool efficiently . in the metal  poor primordial gas ,",
    "the only coolants available are neutral atomic hydrogen ( h ) and molecular hydrogen ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , it has been found ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 , 1997 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) that the @xmath11 molecules are fragile , and are photodissociated throughout the universe .",
    "accordingly , we assume that clouds form stars if and only if they are massive enough to cool via atomic h transition lines ( @xmath12k ) .",
    "the total number of stars formed can be fixed using the recent observations ( songaila & cowie 1996 , tytler et al .",
    "1995 ) of the near universal carbon to hydrogen ( c / h ) ratio in lyman@xmath13 forest clouds at redshifts as high as @xmath1 .",
    "these observations yield the value c / h @xmath5 1% solar for systems with a large range of column  densities .",
    "the fact that ( i ) the scatter in the metalicity from one system to another is only an order of magnitude , and ( ii ) the overdensity of the lowest column density system is only a few ( i.e. , too tenuous to form its own stars ) supports the hypothesis of uniform metal enrichment by an early generation of stars .",
    "based on this star ",
    "formation efficiency , the redshift evolution of the abundance of star  forming clouds , and a detailed composite model spectrum for a low  metalicity stellar population with the local scalo ( 1986 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , we derive the expected number  flux relation and angular size distribution of these star clusters .",
    "we find that ngst would be able to image more than @xmath2 of these star clusters at @xmath3 within its @xmath4 field of view , with @xmath51% of these clusters possibly resolved .",
    "in addition , we show that the pre  galactic population of stars reionize the universe by a redshift of @xmath14 .",
    "the consequent damping of microwave anisotropies on small angular scales is @xmath15% , detectable on @xmath6 angular scales by map and planck .",
    "galactic low  mass stars could also account for some of the microlensing events observed in the halo of the milky way ( alcock et al . 1997 ) , and could also be detected in the future through their lensing of distant quasars ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "to quantify the observational signatures of the first stars in cdm cosmologies , we use a simple semi  analytic approach that is complimentary to more detailed , but computationally expensive and therefore less versatile , 3d numerical simulations ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "the main ingredients of our model are :    we use the press  schechter formalism to find the abundance and mass distribution of virialized dark matter halos . since initially most of the collapsed baryons are in low ",
    "mass systems near the jeans mass , the pressure of the baryons has a significant effect on the collapsed fraction .",
    "effectively , the collapse of the baryons is delayed relative to the dark matter in these low ",
    "mass objects ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "we obtained the exact collapse redshifts of spherically symmetric perturbations by following the motion of both the baryonic and the dark matter shells with a one dimensional hydrodynamics code ( haiman & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "we find that because of shell  crossing with the cold dark matter , baryonic objects with masses @xmath16 , well below the linear  regime jeans mass , are able to collapse by @xmath17@xmath5@xmath18 .",
    "another important effect is the feedback on the collapsed fraction from the photoionization of the igm . as the first stars form , they ionize a fraction @xmath19 of the gas in the universe . in these regions",
    "condensation of objects is strongly suppressed ; to be conservative we assume that only a fraction ( @xmath20 ) of the gas participates in forming new virialized objects .",
    "we calibrate the fraction @xmath21 of the condensed gas converted into stars in each virialized cloud using the inferred c / h ratio in the  absorption forest .",
    "we use tabulated @xmath22c yields of stars with various masses , and consider three different initial mass functions ( imfs ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the total carbon production is a factor of @xmath510 ; a factor of @xmath53 is from the uncertainty in the carbon yields of @xmath23 stars due to the unknown extent of hot bottom burning ( renzini & voli 1981 ) , and another factor of @xmath53 is due to the difference between the scalo and miller  scalo ( 1979 ) imfs . to be conservative , we assume inefficient hot bottom burning , i.e. maximum carbon yields . under these assumptions ,",
    "we find @xmath24 .",
    "is @xmath550% , the fraction of all baryons in stars is @xmath56% .",
    "a factor of @xmath53 is included in this number due to the average time required to produce carbon inside the stars ; i.e. only a third of the total stellar carbon is produced by @xmath1 . ]",
    "we also include a negative feedback on star ",
    "formation due to the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen by photons with energies in the range @xmath25@xmath26 ev .",
    "these photons are not absorbed by neutral h and travel freely across the igm .",
    "we find ( haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ) that the masses required to self - shield @xmath11 against photodissociation by the solomon process ( cf .",
    "field , somerville & dressler 1966 ) are exceedingly high ( @xmath27 for a spherical object with an overdensity of 200 at @xmath28 ) . as a result ,",
    "soon after the appearance of the first few stars , @xmath11 is universally destroyed , and molecular cooling is suppressed even inside dense objects . due to the lack of any other cooling agent in the metal  poor primordial gas , the bulk of the pre ",
    "galactic stars must form via atomic line cooling inside massive clouds with virial temperatures of at least @xmath29k , or @xmath30^{-3/2 } { \\rm m_{\\odot}}$ ] .",
    "we therefore allow star ",
    "formation only inside clouds with at least this mass .    to determine the ionization history of the universe",
    ", we need to follow the evolution of the ionization ( strmgren ) front around each star cluster .",
    "the composite spectrum of radiation which emerges from each star cluster is determined by the stellar imf and the recombination rate inside the cluster .",
    "we follow the time - dependent spectrum of a star of a given mass based on standard spectral atlases ( kurucz 1993 ) and the evolution of the star on the h ",
    "r diagram as prescribed by theoretical evolutionary tracks ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) .    to calculate the fraction of the ionizing photons lost to recombinations inside their parent cloud ,",
    "we adopt the equilibrium @xmath31 density profile of gas inside each cloud according to our spherically  symmetric simulations ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that stars are distributed with the same @xmath31 profile across the cloud , and obtain the number of recombinations under the assumption of ionization equilibrium .",
    "we then use the time ",
    "dependent composite luminosity of each star  forming region to calculate the propagation of a spherical ionization front into the surrounding homogeneous igm .",
    "the ionized fraction of the universe is given by the volume  filling factor @xmath19 of the ionized bubbles , and the universe is reionized when these bubbles overlap so that @xmath32 .",
    "figure  1 shows the predicted number of high  redshift star  clusters at @xmath3 and @xmath7 , per logarithmic flux interval , in the wavelength range of 13.5@xmath33 m .",
    "the number of clusters that could be probed by future space telescopes depends on their sensitivity ; the vertical dashed lines show the proposed imaging thresholds of the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) and the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) .",
    "ngst would be able to image @xmath34 star clusters at its flux limit from high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) within its @xmath4 field of view .",
    "figure  2 shows the predicted angular diameter ( @xmath35 ) distribution of the star clusters .",
    "@xmath35 is taken to be twice the angle subtended by the virial radius @xmath36 of each star ",
    "cluster ; @xmath36 is calculated based on a spherically symmetric @xmath31 density profile , with a factor of 50 overdensity at the surface @xmath36 of the cloud , assuming @xmath37 ( based on the 1d simulations ) .",
    "note that stars in present  day galaxies form in a much smaller central region ; however , the early star clusters may behave differently and form stars at their outskirts , since they are denser , and we have imposed the requirement of efficient atomic line cooling throughout the cloud . with",
    "its proposed 0.06 angular resolution , ngst could resolve @xmath5100 virialized star ",
    "clusters at @xmath3 , and @xmath38 clusters at @xmath7 per field of view .",
    "table 1 summarizes the reionization redshifts and resulting electron scattering optical depths that we obtain in our models for a range of parameters .",
    "we varied the cosmological power spectrum ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , the baryon density ( @xmath41 ) , the star formation efficiency ( @xmath21 ) , the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath42 ) , the imf , and whether or not the negative feedback due to @xmath11 is included . for almost the entire range of parameters",
    ", the universe is reionized by a redshift @xmath43 .",
    "the only exception occurs when the imf is strongly tilted towards low  mass stars .",
    "we considered an unconventional tilt of this kind by adding a constant 1.7 to the power ",
    "law index , while keeping the imf fixed at @xmath44 . with this tilt ,",
    "the increased number of low  mass stars could account for the observed microlensing events .",
    "in this case , however , reionization is strongly suppressed due to the absence of massive stars which ordinarily dominate the ionizing flux .",
    "the redshift evolution of the ionized fraction @xmath19 can be directly converted into the optical depth @xmath45 to electron scattering to high redshifts . for the range of parameters in table  1",
    ", we find @xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding damping factor for the cmb anisotropies ( hu & white 1997 ) is @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "such a damping could be detected by the map and planck satellites , especially if the polarization of the cmb is measured ( zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
