    "two - photon states with specific continuous variable - entanglement properties are required for a number of quantum - information - processing applications .",
    "in particular , pure - state single photons , crucial for applications relying on interference between independently prepared single photons , such as quantum computing with linear optics  @xcite , entanglement swapping  @xcite , and teleportation  @xcite , can be heralded only from _",
    "factorable _ photon pairs , where no correlations exist between the constituent single photons  @xcite .",
    "let us note that factorability may be imposed by postselecting an appropriate subensemble of photon pairs through spectral and/or spatial filtering ; this can be done only at the cost of a typically drastic reduction in count rate and source brightness .",
    "scalable quantum - information processing requires the elimination of this type of postselection .",
    "it has furthermore been shown that , for quantum - information applications involving multiple - pair generation resulting from high - gain parametric down - conversion , spectral or spatial filtering is likewise ineffectual .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coexistence of factorability and a large generated bandwidth is important for some applications , such as the generation of ultrashort fourier - transform - limited heralded single photons  @xcite .",
    "the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion represents a well - established method for the generation of photon pairs , leading to unparalleled flexibility in the resulting continuous - variable entanglement properties .",
    "indeed , the nonlinear crystal dispersion characteristics in conjunction with temporal and spatial structure in the pump beam may be exploited to engineer the type and degree of correlations present in spectral and transverse wave - vector degrees of freedom _ at the source _",
    ", thus eliminating the need for photon pair filtering .    the use of a broadband pump is essential in the context of the generation of photon pairs with spectrally engineered properties ; indeed , a monochromatic pump can access only a one - dimensional subspace of signal - idler frequency space , which precludes certain states of interest .",
    "previous work has established the central role that is played by group velocity mismatch terms between the three fields involved in parametric down - conversion ( pump , signal , and idler ) in the determination of the resulting photon pair properties .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that if the pump pulse propagates at a higher group velocity than one of the generated photons but lower than the conjugate generated photon , then it becomes possible to emit factorable photon pairs .",
    "an important limitation of this technique is that the group velocity condition which must be satisfied occurs only for specific materials , at specific spectral ranges  @xcite , typically in the infrared where single - photon detection is unfortunately not well developed .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed and in some cases implemented which enable effective control over the photon pair entanglement properties in the spectral domain unconstrained by material dispersion .",
    "in one such technique , the effective group velocities experienced by the three fields involved are modified by a pair of diffraction gratings placed before and after the nonlinear crystal so as to generate photon pairs with tunable spectral characteristics  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the spectral content of two photon states may be restricted to the modes supported by a nonlinear cavity which leads , for a short , high - finesse cavity , to factorable , narrowband photon pair generation  @xcite .",
    "likewise , on the one hand a transversely pumped source where signal and idler photons are emitted in a counterpropagating waveguided geometry  @xcite and on the other hand noncollinear parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) where a specific relationship between transverse and longitudinal phase matching is attained  @xcite can both lead to states with spectrally engineered properties .",
    "another route is the use of crystal superlattices , where the dispersion in short crystal segments is compensated by birrefringent compensators , permitting two - photon states with a wide range of possible spectral entanglement characteristics  @xcite .",

    "we study the potential of exploiting the properties of one - dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals in order to generate photon pairs with engineered spectral entanglement properties .",
    "we concentrate on type - ii , frequency degenerate , collinear pdc .",
    "collinear operation is important because it permits pdc in a waveguided geometry , which leads to larger generation rates as well as to effective control over the transverse spatial structure of the emitted light , crucial for efficient single - mode fiber coupling and for spatial mode matching in interference experiments  @xcite .",
    "type - ii operation for which the signal and idler photons are orthogonally polarized is important because it enables efficient photon pair splitting .",
    "we show that a weak index of refraction modulation present in an otherwise standard birefringent nonlinear crystal can be exploited to attain the group velocity conditions , in addition to basic phase matching , required for factorable photon pair generation .",
    "in this paper we analyze the generation of photon pairs by the process of parametric down - conversion in a @xmath0 material characterized by a spatial periodicity in its linear optical properties .",
    "in particular , we study pdc produced by a nonlinear photonic crystal ( nlpc ) based on a standard bulk nonlinear crystal with uniaxial birefringence which has been modified from its natural state by an appropriate physical mechanism so as to yield a periodic variation of the index of refraction for both polarizations , while maintaining the nonlinearity constant throughout the crystal thickness . concretely , within one period of the resulting bragg grating , we assume that the index of refraction for the ordinary ( @xmath1 ) and the extraordinary ray ( @xmath2 ) are given by    @xmath3    this unit cell is assumed to be replicated throughout the crystal length . here , @xmath4 represents the bragg period and @xmath5 is the duty cycle .",

    "in particular , for practical implementations it may be challenging to fabricate the required bragg gratings with periods in the region of hundreds of nanometers compatible with modified dispersive characteristics in the visible ; alternatively , it is possible to use longer periods , together with higher - order band gaps .",
    "the dispersive properties of nplcs are characterized by the function @xmath22 , where from this point we omit the order superscript . for propagating waves at frequencies in the vicinity of the band gap boundaries ,",
    "@xmath22 can differ substantially from the underlying material dispersion relation @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , group velocities can be strongly reduced , while group velocity dispersion terms ( as well as higher - order frequency derivatives of the wavenumber ) can increase markedly , from their values associated with material - only dispersion .    in order to illustrate these effects ,",
    "let us consider a specific example of a one - dimensional nlpc , based on a @xmath41-barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal .",

    "thus , for the specific experimental parameters yielding complete group velocity matching ( see the previous paragraph ) , the resulting second order dispersion coefficients are @xmath148fs@xmath149 , @xmath150fs@xmath149 and @xmath151fs@xmath149 .",
    "the condition @xmath152 will be more accurately satisfied the closer the degenerate pdc frequency is to the band gap boundaries for each polarization .",
    "however , note that , because the band gap boundaries for the two polarizations are spectrally distinct , the weak pump dispersion condition can not be satisfied to the same degree for both photons .",
    "thus , for this specific choice of parameters , while the three mixed terms proportional to @xmath127 are reduced , they are not suppressed perfectly .",
    "the third condition for factorability derived in the previous section , apart from complete group velocity matching and weak pump dispersion , is that the pump should be sufficiently broadband [ see eq.([ec : jsa3 ] ) ] .",
    "note that while the bragg period , permittivity contrast and crystal propagation angle must have specific values in order to guarantee complete group velocity matching , the pump bandwidth and crystal length must fulfil a comparatively soft condition given as the inequality in eq.([ec : pump ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : estado_completo ] represents the resulting joint spectral intensity @xmath153 , for a pump centered at @xmath154 nm with a full width at half maximum bandwidth of @xmath155 nm , with crystal length @xmath156 mm and where the rest of the parameters are as specified above , in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : vg_empcompleto ] .",
    "note that in this plot we have taken into account the complete dispersion ( rather than a truncated power series approach ) and have not used the gaussian approximation . while these approximations were essential for our analysis , it is important to verify the degree of factorability in a two - photon state produced by a realistic source .",
    "figure  [ fig : estado_completo](a ) shows the pump spectral envelope @xmath73 as given by eq.([ec : pump_function ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : estado_completo](b ) shows the phasematching function @xmath157 as given by eq.([ec : pmf ] ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig : estado_completo](c ) shows the joint spectral intensity .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the resulting two - photon state is nearly factorable .",
    "indeed , a numerical schmidt decomposition  @xcite yields a schmidt number of @xmath158 ( which could be reduced further by moderate spectral filtering ) .",
    "as has already been discussed , the effective control over group velocity properties permitted by photonic crystal structures , which may be exploited to obtain nearly factorable two - photon states , enhances higher - order dispersion terms .",
    "this has the effect that , when complete group velocity matching is not fulfilled , the contours of equal amplitude of the phase matching function in @xmath159 space tend to be highly curved . therefore , the technique presented here is not naturally suited for the generation of states exhibiting strict correlation or anticorrelation in frequency , unless the bandwidth of interest is small enough that the curvature of the phase matching function may be neglected .    for practical implementations of this technique ,",
    "it is important to analyze the required tolerances for the experimental parameters , in order to ensure factorizability .",
    "figure  [ fig : tolerances ] shows a plot of the schmidt number @xmath160 as a function of the three parameters which must satisfy a strict condition in order to attain complete group velocity matching .",
    "we plot the schmidt number as a function of each of these parameters , while maintaining all others equal to their nominal values ( which yield the minimum value of @xmath160 ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig : tolerances](a ) shows @xmath160 vs the bragg period @xmath4 , fig .",
    "[ fig : tolerances](b ) shows @xmath160 vs the permittivity contrast @xmath13 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : tolerances](c ) shows @xmath160 vs the crystal propagation angle @xmath138 .",
    "we define the tolerance in variable @xmath161 as @xmath162 where @xmath163 ( with @xmath164 ) are the values where @xmath160 rises to @xmath165 in terms of the value of the schmidt number attained when all variables are equal to their nominal values @xmath166 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath167 nm , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 .",
    "we have studied the generation of photon pairs by spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a one - dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal , with a broadband pump .",
    "we have considered a nlpc based on a standard @xmath170 crystal with uniaxial birefringence where the dispersion for both polarizations has been altered from its natural state so that , throughout the length of the resulting crystal , the index of refraction for each polarization alternately takes the value consistent with material - only dispersion and a value that is larger than the former , consistent with a small permittivity contrast .",
    "we have developed a set of conditions that must be satisfied in order to guarantee a nearly factorable two photon state .",
    "these conditions are : ( i ) complete group velocity matching , where the pump pulse and the signal and idler photons propagate at the same group velocity [ see eq.([ec : gvm ] ) ] , ( ii ) weak pump dispersion [ characterized by coefficients @xmath124 , see eq.([ec : taylor_terms ] ) ] , relative to signal and idler dispersion [ characterized by coefficients @xmath102 , see eq.([ec : weak_pump ] ) ] , and ( iii ) sufficient pump bandwidth [ see eq.([ec : pump ] ) ] .",
    "we have shown that the strongly - modified dispersion in the spectral vicinity of the bandgap boundaries in a nlpc may be exploited in order to fulfil condition ( i ) , and to partially fulfil condition ( ii ) .",
    "the essential advantage of this technique is that for an arbitrary nonlinear material operated at an arbitrary spectral range it is in principle possible to design a photonic - crystal structure which counteracts the material dispersion so as to permit the generation of factorable photon pairs in a type - ii degenerate , collinear geometry which is compatible with wave guiding and which permits high efficiency photon pair splitting .",
    "it is , however , anticipated that the fabrication of the appropriate photonic - crystal structure may pose the main technical challenge in practical implementations .",
    "longer bragg periods , potentially more easily fabricated , could be exploited through higher - order bandgaps .",
    "it is expected that this work may be important for the development of optimized nonclassical light sources for quantum information processing ."
