    "<S> the intermediate state dependence of photoelectron circular dichroism ( pecd ) in resonance - enhanced multi - photon ionization of fenchone in the gas phase is experimentally studied . by scanning the excitation wavelength from 359 to 431 nm </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously excite up to three electronically distinct resonances . in the pecd experiment performed with a broadband femtosecond laser their respective contributions to the photoelectron spectrum can be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution spectroscopy allows us to identify two of the resonances as belonging to the b- and c - bands , which involve excitation to states with 3s and 3p rydberg character , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a sign change in the pecd signal depending on which electronic state is used as an intermediate . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , scanning the laser wavelength reveals a decrease of pecd magnitude with increasing photoelectron energy for the 3s state . </S>"
