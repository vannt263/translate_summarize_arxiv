    "the question about the proper value of the nuclear incompressibility @xmath0 is still open .",
    "the model dependence of this quantity amounts to a difference of the order of @xmath3 10 - 20% among the values obtained within different theoretical models .",
    "there is a renewed interest in this issue , motivated both by the improved quality of the recent experimental measurements of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) , and by the progress of relativistic mean field models ( rmf ) which are to be confronted with more traditional non - relativistic models based on skyrme or gogny effective forces .",
    "skyrme energy functionals have been widely used in nuclear structure calculations over three decades .",
    "the first skyrme effective forces were built in the pioneering work of vautherin and brink  @xcite , by fitting their parameters to nuclear matter properties ( the saturation point ) and to selected observables ( binding energies and charge radii ) of closed - shell nuclei calculated in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation . later , many improvements of the skyrme energy functional have been devised .",
    "these have been possible also because the mean field approach was extended to the time - dependent case ( time - dependent hf , tdhf ) and to its small amplitude limit ( random phase approximation , rpa ) . within this scheme",
    ", it is possible to calculate the collective nuclear excitations and to explore the correlations between their properties and the force parameters , or some physically meaningful combinations of them .",
    "the relation between the isgmr and the nuclear incompressibility is one of such relations .",
    "the introduction of reliable rmf effective lagrangians is more recent .",
    "however , the progress in this field has been quite fast  @xcite , and we can nowadays discuss the properties of the rmf parametrizations on the same footing as the skyrme  @xcite and gogny  @xcite functionals .",
    "the nuclear incompressibility @xmath0 is related to the curvature of the energy per particle @xmath4 in symmetric nuclear matter around the minimum @xmath5 , i.e. , at the saturation point : @xmath6 the interest of determining the value of @xmath0 stems also from its impact on the physics of supernovae and neutron stars .    until a year ago",
    ", the status of the nuclear incompressibility problem could be summarized as follows . from calculations based on skyrme functionals",
    "different groups have extracted values of @xmath0 of the order of 210 - 220 mev . using the gogny functionals ,",
    "a value of @xmath0 around 230 mev was obtained . finally , the relativistic calculations predicted values in the range 250 - 270 mev .",
    "all these results made use of the measured value of the isgmr , e.g. in @xmath1pb , as explained below .",
    "this situation for the nuclear incompressibility `` puzzle '' has been reviewed in ref .",
    "there , it was shown that the accuracy of the isgmr data obtained at texas a&m@xcite allows for extracting @xmath0 with an experimental error of no more than @xmath7 12 mev . moreover ,",
    "a rather important new conclusion was reached .",
    "the previous works based on the skyrme forces consisted of not fully self - consistent hf plus rpa calculations in which the two - body residual coulomb and spin - orbit forces were neglected .",
    "these terms are rather small since they affect the monopole energy in @xmath1pb by only 4 - 5% , but this produces a change of 8 - 10% in the extracted value of the nuclear incompressibility . by considering this effect",
    ", the new value of @xmath0 from skyrme functionals turns out to be 235 mev , in very good agreement with that extracted from the gogny calculations .",
    "consequently , there is no discrepancy between the results of the different non - relativistic calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the gap with the relativistic results remains significant .",
    "the most recent attempts in the literature@xcite to attack this problem are focused on the possible relation(s ) between the monopole energy in systems with a neutron excess , like @xmath1pb , and the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , one of the clear differences between the skyrme and rmf functionals concerns the behaviour of the symmetry energy around the saturation point @xmath5 .",
    "the skyrme energy functionals are characterized by smaller values of the symmetry energy at saturation , and of the corresponding slope , as compared with the rmf functionals . in this sense",
    "it may be said that the rmf functionals are `` stiff '' compared with the `` soft '' non - relativistic ones .    in ref .",
    "@xcite some effective lagrangians whose symmetry energy has different density dependences are built .",
    "this is easy to achieve since , by adjusting the @xmath9-meson coupling constant , one can at the same time soften the symmetry energy @xmath8 and lower its value at the saturation point , @xmath10 .",
    "it is thus found that the extracted values of @xmath0 indeed differ and can even become close to the skyrme force values if @xmath11 is around 28 mev .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite no systematic treatment of finite nuclei is attempted . in ref .  @xcite it is pointed out that rmf parametrizations with @xmath11 lower than 32 mev can not describe satisfactorily the @xmath12 nuclei .",
    "the authors conclude from their calculations that the lower limit for the rmf value of @xmath0 is around 250 mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a markedly improved version of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , this lower limit is confirmed since @xmath0 results to be 248 mev .    while in the relativistic framework it seems impossible to push the value of @xmath0 below this lower limit , the recent results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that one can build at least one skyrme - type interaction having @xmath0=255 mev and reproducing the correct isgmr energy in @xmath1pb .",
    "this is at variance with all other non - relativistic calculations quoted in ref .",
    "moreover , the origin of the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is unclear .",
    "does it correspond to an effective force with a symmetry energy which is as stiff as that associated with the rmf lagrangians ? or is some other parameter playing a role ?",
    "it seems necessary to make a systematic analysis of what is the upper limit for @xmath0 within the non - relativistic framework .",
    "the value of 230 mev is extracted from a subset of the existing skyrme parametrizations .",
    "our main goal is to answer the question whether it is possible to build new interactions in such a way that @xmath0 becomes closer to the rmf value , as well as to study what are the crucial quantities which control this variation of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we would like to understand the ( so far , singular ) result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ theo ] we review how the nuclear incompressibility is extracted from the microscopic calculations using the isgmr experimental data , and what are the plausible quantitative arguments in favour of the idea that the density dependence of the symmetry energy plays a role . in sec .",
    "[ skyrme ] we describe our fitting of new skyrme interactions suitable for the microscopic isgmr calculations , and in sec .  [ results ] we describe the results obtained and the implications for the value of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in all the discussions of the relationship between the nuclear matter incompressibility and the isgmr in finite nuclei , the starting point is the definition given by j.p .",
    "blaizot  @xcite of the finite nucleus incompressibility @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nucleon mass and @xmath16 is the ground - state mean square radius .",
    "this expression has a well - defined meaning in medium - heavy nuclei , where the isgmr is associated to a single peak at the energy @xmath17 80@xmath18 . in light nuclei",
    "the monopole strength is very much fragmented and many states show up , whose microscopic structure does not correspond to the simple picture of the radial `` breathing mode '' according to theoretical calculations ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of the nuclei studied in  @xcite , the existence of a single",
    ", collective monopole state is quite evident from the measured cross sections . in particular , in the case of @xmath1pb which is the object of our present study , the experimental peak energy and the centroid energies @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( defined respectively as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-th moment of the strength function ) essentially coincide , leaving out any ambiguity about the correct value of @xmath25 to be used for determining the experimental value of @xmath13 .",
    "however , finding a theoretical relation between @xmath13 and @xmath0 is less simple . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the generic expression of the energy functional associated with skyrme - hf has been written in the case of a finite spherical system . at variance with that of infinite matter ,",
    "the density is not uniform and can not be reduced to a simple number . therefore , to minimize the energy functional and",
    "find its second derivative around the minimum one has to resort to various simplifying hypotheses .",
    "the main one is the use of the so - called scaling model , in which a simple shape of the ground - state density @xmath5 is assumed and its changes are associated to a single parameter @xmath26 , i.e. , they are of the type @xmath27 . in this way , the expression for the finite system incompressibility can be found . by isolating the terms corresponding to the volume , surface , symmetry and coulomb contributions ,",
    "the result can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "6.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we remind here that , in the past many authors have used the formula ( [ kaexpl ] ) as an ansatz and have tried to obtain the parameters of the r.h.s . from a numerical fit , using as input the experimental values of @xmath13 in different nuclei .",
    "this procedure is not stable and leads to ill - defined values of the parameters  @xcite , so that it is nowadays abandoned .",
    "instead , the microscopic method to deduce @xmath0 relies on the fact that rpa calculations of the isgmr can be performed by using functionals characterized by different values of @xmath0 .",
    "if the calculations done with a given functional reproduce the experimental isgmr energy , the associated value of @xmath0 should be chosen as the best one .",
    "let us examine this in more detail .",
    "mainly one nucleus has been used so far , that is , @xmath1pb . in the first work in which the microscopic procedure has been applied",
    "@xcite , the rpa values for @xmath13 obtained from the rpa centroid energies @xmath20 have been plotted versus the @xmath0 of the force used .",
    "then , an empirical linear fit of the results was performed , namely @xmath30 this relation allows to extract the best value for @xmath0 by inserting the experimental @xmath13 .",
    "in@xcite the explicit form of ( [ linear ] ) in the case of @xmath1pb is @xmath31 [ mev ] . the second term of the r.h.s .",
    "is much smaller than the first term .",
    "consequently , even if in principle the last formula together with ( [ defka ] ) would lead to @xmath32 , this equation can be approximated by @xmath33 ( neglecting the second term under the square root ) .",
    "this explains why in many of the works quoted in  @xcite a successful interpolation of the type @xmath34 was done : in practice , eqs .",
    "( [ linear ] ) and ( [ linear2 ] ) are equivalent .",
    "it is from either of these relations , using the experimental isgmr energy in @xmath1pb which is 14.17 @xmath7 0.28 mev , that the values for @xmath0 mentioned in sec .",
    "i were obtained .",
    "the uncertainity of the value of @xmath0 which is deduced is @xmath35 the experimental error on the monopole energy , plus a theoretical error of the same order ( see  @xcite ) , produce a global error bar of @xmath7 12 mev on @xmath0 .",
    "one may argue why the linear relations just introduced are valid .",
    "so far , eq . ( [ kaexpl ] ) has not played in fact any explicit role in the deduction of @xmath0 .",
    "however , this expression can be taken as a rather useful guideline .",
    "given a microscopic functional , the different terms @xmath36 , @xmath2 and @xmath37 ( in addition to @xmath0 ) entering this formula can be calculated as described shortly below .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath13 differs from the microscopic outcome of rpa , as a rule , by about 5% .",
    "therefore , we make in the rest of this section a detailed analysis of the role of the different terms in ( [ kaexpl ] ) .",
    "if , for a family of functionals , @xmath13 depends linearly on @xmath0 as written in ( [ linear ] ) , it means that the other terms do not vary significantly .",
    "this is what happens for a large subset of the skyrme and gogny parametrizations , as it is evident from fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "however , the role of the surface , symmetry and coulomb terms should be critically re - examined if new functionals , including relativistic ones , enter in the discussion .    the expression for these terms",
    "have been given in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath36 can not be calculated analytically , but numerical estimates are possible within both the quantal and semiclassical scheme .",
    "we refer the reader to ref.@xcite for an example of a quantal derivation ( which is a scaled hartree - fock calculation of semi - infinite nuclear matter ) .",
    "the most recent semiclassical , i.e. , extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) calculations , have been performed both in the non - relativistic and in the relativistic scheme and have shown that the quantity @xmath36 is well approximated by @xmath38 with @xmath39 -1 ( however , it should be noted that @xmath40 tends to grow with @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this approximation is valid in the case of all the forces used in this work : we have seen that , e.g. , @xmath41 if @xmath0=230 mev and @xmath42 if @xmath0=250 mev .    in order to study @xmath2 , we first give some necessary definitions of the symmetry energy and of the parameters related to its density dependence .",
    "we define the symmetry energy by writing the total energy density @xmath43 as the sum of an isoscalar part @xmath44 which depends only on the total density @xmath45 , and an isovector part , @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "we remind in this context that in a homogeneous system , @xmath48 .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath8 can be expanded up to second order around @xmath5 , @xmath49 the value of the symmetry energy at saturation @xmath50 is often denoted as @xmath11 and we are following use the same notation in this paper .",
    "other notations , like @xmath51 or @xmath52 , are also employed in the literature .",
    "the first and second derivatives of @xmath8 at the saturation point have been written many times in terms of the so - called parameters @xmath53 and @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is quite unfortunate that the symbol @xmath2 has been used in the literature with such different meanings , either in connection with @xmath56 or in eq .",
    "( [ kaexpl ] ) . here",
    ", we will always use @xmath2 to mean the symmetry term of @xmath13 in eq.(3 ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath2 is @xmath57 and from this expression it is evident that this parameter contains some relevant information about the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "the values of @xmath11 are , as a rule , larger in the case of the rmf functionals than for the skyrme ones .",
    "a larger value of @xmath11 is correlated with a larger value of @xmath58 , which is usually a positive quantity although it may sometimes become negative ( cf .",
    "@xcite and fig . 4 of  @xcite , as well as tables  [ table : properties1 ] and[table : properties2 ] in this paper ) .",
    "in the next section we show that a larger @xmath11 is also correlated with a more negative value of @xmath2 , at least for the forces we have studied .",
    "the explanation which is given for the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath58 is that the fits to finite nuclei observables constrain the symmetry energy at some average density @xmath59 lower than @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) . in the case of one set of forces introduced in this paper ( see sec .",
    "[ skyrme ] ) , this typical behaviour of the symmetry energy is shown in fig.[figure_sym ] . in a narrow region around @xmath60=0.10 @xmath61 ( @xmath7 0.001 @xmath61 )",
    "all curves cross one another at a value @xmath8=25 @xmath7 1 mev .",
    "when the symmetry energy at saturation is larger , the slope is also larger .",
    "the other sets of forces show qualitatively the same trend .",
    "the last term of ( [ kaexpl ] ) is the coulomb contribution which is unlikely to be very much model dependent .",
    "it is written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the average inter - particle spacing .    in summary ,",
    "if we want to compare two models , say i and ii ( they could be for instance a non - relativistic and a rmf functional , respectively ) , we will write , by using @xmath64 , @xmath65 we have already mentioned that @xmath2 is negative , and the same is true for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "all can be viewed as corrections to the leading term @xmath0 .",

    "we use them to calculate the monopole energy in @xmath1pb , defined as @xmath83 .",
    "we stress again that we can obtain this quantity without any lack of self - consistency , and with a numerical error which is not larger than the experimental uncertainity .    a first class of forces",
    "are built using the sly4 protocol and have a density dependence characterized by the exponent @xmath81=1/6 . with these forces ,",
    "a value of @xmath0 around 230 - 240 mev is obtained , confirming the previous results of  @xcite . to obtain the correct monopole energy with larger values of @xmath0",
    "would require an unrealistically large value of @xmath11 , since @xmath25 increases with @xmath0 and decreases with @xmath11 .",
    "we understand this latter dependence as a consequence of the direct relation between the @xmath0 and the _ density dependence _ of the symmetry energy @xmath8 , and of the unavoidable correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath11 .    to solve the discrepancy with the result of agrawal _ et al .",
    "_ , we have built a second class of forces which have the density dependence @xmath81=0.3563 . using this class of forces we can arrive at @xmath0 between 250 and 260 mev .",
    "actually , we can reproduce very accurately the results of ref.@xcite , if we use the same approximations made in that work , namely if we neglect the coulomb exchange and center - of - mass corrections in the hf mean field .",
    "this shows that the differences between ref .",
    "@xcite and our work in the detailed protocol used to determine the forces , are unimportant .",
    "we have observed that the differences between the results of the two classes of skyrme forces built in the present paper , come both from the surface and symmetry contributions , as a consequence of the change in the exponent @xmath81 , and from the neglect of coulomb exchange and center - of - mass corrections , which affect the monopole energy by about 150 kev and therefore , @xmath0 by about 5 mev .    in conclusion , within the non - relativistic framework",
    "there is not a unique relation between the value of @xmath0 associated with an effective force and the monopole energy predicted by that force .",
    "_ bona fide _ skyrme forces can either predict 230 - 240 mev for @xmath0 or arrive at 250 mev if a different density dependence is adopted and if one excludes some terms from the energy functional . this latter procedure , although it may mimick the relativistic case , is not conceptually well justified .",
