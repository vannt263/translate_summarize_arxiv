    "in theoretical cosmology , many insights can already be gained from spatially isotropic friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker models @xmath0 with @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the matter content in such a highly symmetric space - time can only be of the form of a perfect fluid with stress - energy tensor @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density of the fluid , @xmath5 its pressure and @xmath6 the 4-velocity vector field of isotropic co - moving observers .",
    "once an equation of state @xmath7 is specified to characterize the matter ingredients , the continuity equation @xmath8 with the hubble parameter @xmath9 allows one to determine the behavior of @xmath10 in which energy density changes during the expansion or contraction of the universe .",
    "this function , in turn , enters the friedmann equation @xmath11 and allows one to derive solutions for @xmath12 .    in general",
    ", one would expect the equation of state @xmath7 to be non - linear which would make an explicit solution of the continuity and friedmann equations difficult .",
    "it is thus quite fortunate that in many cases linear equations of state @xmath13 with @xmath14 constant are sufficient to describe the main matter contributions encountered in cosmology at least phenomenologically .",
    "the influence of compact objects on cosmological scales is , for instance , described well by the simple dust equation of state @xmath15 .",
    "relativistic matter , mainly electromagnetic radiation , satisfies the linear equation of state @xmath16 .",
    "the latter example is an exact equation describing the maxwell field , rather than an approximation for large scale cosmology .",
    "it is thus , at first sight , rather surprising that the dynamics of electromagnetic waves in a universe can be summarized in such a simple equation of state irrespective of details of the field configuration .",
    "the result follows in the standard way from the trace - freedom of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor and is thus related to the conformal symmetry of maxwell s equations .",
    "that the availability of such a simple equation of state is very special for a matter field can be seen by taking the example of a scalar field @xmath17 with potential @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", we have an energy density @xmath19 and pressure @xmath20 .",
    "unless the scalar is free and massless , @xmath21 for which we have a stiff fluid @xmath22 , there is no simple relation between pressure and energy density independently of a specific solution .    any conformal symmetry such as that of elecromagnetism might be broken by quantum effects especially when quantum gravity with its new scale provided by the planck length is taken into account .",
    "the coupling of the electromagnetic field to geometry will then change , and exact conformal symmetries can easily be violated . accordingly",
    ", one expects corrections from quantum gravity to the radiation equation of state and corresponding effects in the universe evolution during radiation dominated epochs . in loop quantum cosmology",
    "@xcite equations of state of matter fields are in general modified by perturbative corrections at large scales and non - perturbative ones on small scales @xcite .",
    "this has mainly been studied so far for a scalar field for which quantum modifications can be so strong that negative pressure results independently of the chosen potential @xcite .",
    "the main reason is the fact that the isotropic scalar field hamiltonian @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the momentum of @xmath17 , contains an inverse power of the scale factor @xmath25 . for quantum gravity",
    ", this factor has to be quantized , too . using the methods of @xcite",
    ", it turns out that inverse powers receive strong loop quantum corrections at small length scales @xcite .",
    "accordingly , such modifications play a role for effective equations describing the universe after the big bang ( or even during the quantum transition through the big bang singularity ) . during later stages , modifications are expected to decrease in size , but they might still be relevant due to sometimes tight constraints on evolution parameters .",
    "an extension to the usual matter ingredients of cosmology with linear equations of state is , however , difficult since the modification is based on quantizations of the fundamental field hamiltonians .",
    "equations of state are obtained from fundamental hamiltonians after an analysis of the matter field equations , which can be difficult in general especially when quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "the only exception is the dust case since it implies a constant hamiltonian ( the total mass of dust ) which is straightforwardly quantized without any corrections .",
    "thus , although the dust energy density is proportional to @xmath26 and metric dependent in a way which involves the inverse , it does not receive any modification since the hamiltonian , i.e.  total energy @xmath27 , is the essential object to be quantized . for radiation with @xmath28",
    "the expectation is not clear since the total energy does behave like an inverse power of @xmath25 , but this follows only after an indirect analysis of the field dynamics .",
    "it is not the solution @xmath29 of the continuity equation which is quantized but the original field hamiltonian from which the equation of state has to be derived first .",
    "one thus has to go back to the fundamental maxwell hamiltonian , derive energy density and pressure and see how quantum effects change the equation of state . if this is completed , one may attempt to solve the continuity equation to obtain corrections to @xmath10",
    ".    we will derive such corrections in this article , using the canonical quantization given by loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "candidates for hamiltonian operators of the maxwell field have been proposed @xcite which show several sources of correction terms . to derive corrections to the equation of state , however , we need to perform the usual calculation in a hamiltonian formulation .",
    "thus , we first present the canonical formulation for the free classical maxwell field to rederive the standard result for the equation of state parameter @xmath14 without reference to an action or the stress - energy tensor .",
    "appropriate modifications to the matter hamiltonian @xmath30 are then made to derive possible loop quantum gravity corrections to the equation of state @xmath14 .",
    "we will show that one case of corrections results again in a linear equation of state , albeit in a corrected way which depends on the basic discreteness scale of quantum gravity . in this case",
    "we are able to express , as in the classical case , the full field dynamics in terms of a simple modified @xmath14 , and to solve explicitly for @xmath10 .",
    "our derivation takes into account inhomogeneous field configurations and presents the first modified equation of state obtained for a realistic matter source in loop quantum gravity .",
    "in a canonical formulation , the hamiltonian @xmath30 rather than the action is used to determine equations of motion of any function @xmath31 on the phase space by means of poisson brackets , @xmath32 .",
    "the poisson structure defines the kinematical arena which follows from the field variables and momenta .",
    "the basic configuration variable in a lagrangian formulation of maxwell s field theory is the vector potential @xmath33 which determines the field strength tensor @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the covariant derivative operator .",
    "notice that @xmath35 can be replaced by the partial derivative operator @xmath36 even on a curved space - time since the field strength tensor @xmath37 is antisymmetric .",
    "the action for the free maxwell field in an arbitrary background space is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the determinant of the lorentzian space - time metric @xmath40 . from the action one",
    "obtains maxwell s equations as the euler  lagrange equations extremizing @xmath41 .    a canonical formalism ( hamiltonian framework )",
    "is achieved by performing a legendre transform of this action @xmath42 , replacing time derivatives of configuration variables by momenta .",
    "this , as always , requires one to treat space and time differently and is the reason why the canonical formulation is not manifestly covariant .",
    "we introduce a foliation of the space - time @xmath43 by a family of space - like hypersurfaces @xmath44 in terms of a time function @xmath45 on @xmath46 .",
    "canonical variables will depend on which time function one chooses , but the resulting dynamics of observable quantities will remain covariant .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath47 be a timelike vector field whose integral curves intersect each leaf @xmath48 of the foliation precisely once and which is normalized such that @xmath49 .",
    "this @xmath47 is the ` evolution vector field ' along whose orbits different points on all @xmath50 can be identified .",
    "this allows us to write all space - time fields in terms of @xmath45-dependent components defined on a spatial manifold @xmath51 .",
    "lie derivatives of space - time fields along @xmath47 are identified with ` time - derivatives ' of the spatial fields .       in terms of the normal @xmath52 to spatial slices and a spacelike part @xmath53 .",

    "[ split ] , decompose @xmath47 into normal and tangential parts with respect to @xmath54 by defining the lapse function @xmath55 and the shift vector @xmath56 as @xmath57 with @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the unit normal vector field to the hypersurfaces @xmath54 . the space - time metric @xmath40 induces a spatial metric @xmath60 by the formula @xmath61 . now using @xmath62 and @xmath63 to project fields normal and tangential to @xmath54 , we can decompose the field strength tensor @xmath37 and the action @xmath42 as follows :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , and the action takes the form @xmath66    it follows that the conjugate momentum @xmath67 to the configuration variable @xmath33 is given by @xmath68 which is a densitized vector field because of the presence of @xmath69 .",
    "its physical interpretation is as the electric field measured by an observer with 4-velocity @xmath52 . now",
    "the action can be expressed in terms of the canonical variables @xmath33 and @xmath67 ,    @xmath70    we can cast the action in equation ( [ actionpia ] ) into the desired form @xmath71 $ ] by writing the integrand in the following manner : @xmath72 \\nonumber\\ \\\\ & = & \\int { { \\rm d}}t \\int_{\\sigma_{t}}{{\\rm d}}^{3}x\\left[\\pi^{a } \\left(\\dot{a}_{a}-\\partial_{a}\\left(a_{d}t^{d}\\right)- n^{c}f_{ca}\\right)-n\\left(\\frac{2\\pi } { \\sqrt{q}}\\pi^{a}\\pi^{b}q_{ab } + \\frac { \\sqrt{q}}{16\\pi}f_{ab}f_{cd } q^{ac}q^{bd}\\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\ \\\\   & = & \\int { { \\rm d}}t \\int_{\\sigma_{t}}{{\\rm d}}^{3}x\\left[\\pi^{a}\\dot{a}_{a}+   \\left(a_{d}t^{d}\\right)\\partial_{a}\\pi^{a}-n^{c }   \\pi^{a}f_{ca}-n\\left(\\frac{2\\pi   } { \\sqrt{q}}\\pi^{a}\\pi^{b}q_{ab } + \\frac { \\sqrt{q}}{16\\pi}f_{ab}f_{cd } q^{ac}q^{bd}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    having integrated by parts in the second term .",
    "this completes the legendre transform and we can read off the equations of motion from equation ( [ desiredaction ] ) .",
    "first , since the momentum conjugate to the time component of @xmath33 is absent , extremization of the action with respect to @xmath73 results in @xmath74 as the usual gauss constraint .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the maxwell field then is    @xmath75\\ ] ]    with two contributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 which , when added to the gravitational hamiltonian , give matter contributions to the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraint , respectively . from ( [ hamiltonianconstraint ] )",
    "we obtain the usual expression @xmath78 for the energy of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the evolution equations can be obtained by evaluating the poisson brackets of @xmath33 and @xmath67 with the hamiltonian . although we will not need the explicit form of these equations , we present them in appendix [ app : eom ] for the sake of completeness .",
    "here we rather determine energy and pressure from our canonical expressions ( see also @xcite ) in order to formulate the equation of state .",

    "this gives    @xmath82\\,.\\label{pressure2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , the equation of state can easily be obtained from ( [ rhom ] ) and ( [ pressure2 ] ) : @xmath83 which is the standard result .",
    "being interested in effects from quantum gravity , we have to quantize metric components in the matter hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , not just the matter field itself .",
    "metric factors are thus not treated as a given classical background but become operators .",
    "this requires a quantum representation , which can only be found if we also use canonical variables for the geometry .",
    "we thus need to use momenta of @xmath60 even though they do not appear in the matter hamiltonian .    in loop quantum gravity ,",
    "the basic objects appropriate for a canonical quantization are constructed from a densitized triad @xmath84 and the su(2)-connection @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the spin connection compatible with the triad , @xmath87 the extrinsic curvature and @xmath88 is the barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite . instead of the spatial metric @xmath60",
    "we thus use the densitized vector fields @xmath89 which are related to the metric by @xmath90 .    these fields can not be quantized directly but must be integrated suitably to remove local divergences in delta functions . the basic ingredient of a loop quantization is to use holonomies @xmath91 for all curves @xmath92 and fluxes @xmath93 for all surfaces @xmath94 where @xmath95 are pauli matrices , @xmath96 is the tangent vector to the edge @xmath97 and @xmath98 the co - normal to the surface @xmath99 .",
    "thus the canonical quantization is performed by using holonomies and fluxes as operators , turning their poisson brackets into commutators @xcite .",
    "a quantum representation is easily constructed by using states which are functionals of connections .",
    "since holonomies are our basic connection dependent operators , they serve to generate all states from a basic one which is just a constant on the space of connections .",
    "all states are then functionals depending on connections through holonomies , and they can be associated with graphs collecting the edges of holonomies used in the generation process .",
    "an orthonormal basis can be determined explicitly in terms of spin network states @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of this quantization is that fluxes and spatial geometrical operators such as area and volume @xcite have discrete spectra containing zero .",
    "hence , their inverses do not exist as densely defined operators . however , a quantization of the matter hamiltonian such as ( [ hamiltonian ] ) demands the quantization of such inverse expressions since , e.g. , @xmath100 or the metric @xmath60 which can only be obtained by inverting the densitized triad , appear in the matter hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the quantization of the matter hamiltonian seems , at first , to be seriously problematic .",
    "however , a well defined quantization is possible after noticing that the poisson bracket of the volume with connection components , @xmath101 amounts to an inverse of densitized triad components @xcite .",
    "this is written here in terms of the co - triad @xmath102 from which we can directly obtain the metric @xmath103 .",
    "similar expressions allow one to include the inverse determinant of the metric as we need it in the maxwell hamiltonian .",
    "the left hand side of ( [ poissonbracketofvolume ] ) does not refer to inverse densitized triad components and can be quantized : we can express the connection component through holonomies , use the volume operator and turn the poisson bracket into a commutator .",
    "this observation enables us to quantize inverse powers of the densitized triad . leading to well - defined operators",
    ", this quantization process implies characteristic modifications of the classical expressions such as ( [ hamiltonian ] ) on small scales , where densitized triad components are small .",
    "moreover , since there are many different but classically equivalent ways to rewrite expressions like ( [ poissonbracketofvolume ] ) for which the quantization would give different results , there are quantization ambiguities .",
    "however , several characteristic effects occur for any quantization choice such that they can be studied reliably with phenomenological applications in mind .",
    "hamiltonian operators of a quantum theory can , in semiclassical regimes , be approximated by effective expressions which amend the classical ones by quantum correction terms .",
    "the general procedure , detailed in @xcite , requires one to evaluate expectation values of the hamiltonian in suitable semiclassical states .",
    "a crucial ingredient in loop quantum gravity is the discrete , non - local nature of states written in terms of holonomies as basic objects .",
    "although hamiltonian operators on such discrete lattice states are quite complicated , expectation values can often be evaluated explicitly in perturbative regimes where one assumes the geometry to be close to a symmetric one .",
    "this is certainly allowed in our applications to derive the effective equation of state of radiation in a flat frw universe .",
    "the background symmetry implies the existence of three approximate spatial killing vector fields @xmath104 generating transitive isometries .",
    "we will only make use of this translational symmetry , not of the additional rotations in the construction of states .",
    "these vector fields can be used as a tangent space basis , thus denoting tensor indices for components in this basis by capital letters @xmath105    the background symmetry also has implications for the selection of states of the quantum theory .",
    "a general quantization has to consider arbitrary states , but for effective equations one computes expectation values only in states suitable for a semiclassical regime .",
    "for perturbative inhomogeneities , one can restrict lattices as they occur in general graphs to regular cubic ones and thus simplify geometrical operators .",
    "this has been developed recently in @xcite for metric perturbations as well as for a scalar field , and we can directly apply the same techniques to the maxwell hamiltonian .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper for more details .      in a perturbative regime around a spatially flat isotropic solution",
    ", one can choose the canonical variables to be given by functions @xmath106 which determine a densitized triad by @xmath107 and extrinsic curvature by @xmath108 .",
    "thus , one can diagonalize the canonical variables compared to the general situation where all matrix elements of @xmath89 and @xmath109 would be independent . as seen in many symmetric models ,",
    "this simplifies the calculations considerably : it allows one to replace involved su(2 ) calculations by much simpler u(1 ) calculations @xcite .",
    "su(2 ) matrices arise because loop quantum gravity is based on holonomies @xmath110 of a connection @xmath111 related to extrinsic curvature . for unrestricted connections",
    ", holonomies can take any su(2 ) value , but a diagonalization implies that all quantities can be reduced to a maximal abelian subgroup u(1 ) .",
    "matrix elements of hamiltonians and other operators can then be computed in explicit form .",
    "using properties of the general loop representation mentioned before , basic variables of the quantum theory are , for a chosen lattice , u(1 ) elements @xmath112 attached to a lattice link @xmath113 starting at a vertex @xmath114 and pointing in direction @xmath115 , and their conjugate fluxes @xmath116 .",
    "the u(1 ) elements @xmath112 appear as matrix elements in su(2 ) holonomies @xmath117 along edges @xmath113 . following the construction of the hilbert space using holonomies as ``",
    "creation '' operators by acting on a state which is constant on the space of connections , a general state is a functional @xmath118 .",
    "allowing all possible values of assignments of integers @xmath119 to the lattice edges @xmath113 , this defines an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space .",
    "basic operators are represented as holonomies @xmath120 remain unchanged , and fluxes @xmath121 is the planck length and a subscript @xmath122 means that the edge preceding the vertex @xmath114 in the chosen orientation is taken . these and the following constructions are explained in more detail in @xcite .",
    "effective equations are obtained by taking expectation values of the hamiltonian operator and computing a continuum approximation of the result ( similar to a derivative expansion in low energy effective actions ) .",
    "the result is a local field theory which includes quantum corrections .",
    "this is done by relating holonomies @xmath123 to continuum fields @xmath124 through mid - point evaluation on the edges @xmath113 ( denoted by an argument @xmath125 of the fields ) , and similarly for fluxes @xmath126 although the non - local basic objects do not allow us to define continuum fields at all spatial points , in a slowly - varying field approximation the mid - point evaluations are sufficient to define the continuum fields by interpolation . here",
    ", @xmath127 is the coordinate length of lattice links .",
    "it does not appear in the quantum theory which only refers to states and their labels @xmath128 .",
    "this is independent of coordinates and only makes use of an abstract , labelled graph .",
    "the parameter @xmath127 only enters in the continuum approximation since it is classical fields which are integrated and related to holonomies and fluxes .",
    "these continuum fields , or tensor components @xmath129 and @xmath124 , must depend on which coordinates are chosen to represent them .",
    "for the situation given here , the combinations @xmath130 and @xmath131 , as they appear in holonomies and fluxes evaluated for slowly - varying fields , are coordinate independent .",
    "a further operator we can immediately define is the volume operator . using the classical expression @xmath132",
    "we introduce the volume operator @xmath133 which , using ( [ fluxvert ] ) , has eigenvalues @xmath134 this operator is not only interesting for geometrical purposes , but also for making use of the identity ( [ poissonbracketofvolume ] ) or , more generally , @xmath135 which gives inverse powers of the densitized triad for any @xmath136 often appearing in matter hamiltonians .",

    "this can then be quantized , using ( [ bc ] ) with @xmath145 , to @xmath146 noticing that the momentum @xmath147 of the electromagnetic field is quantized , just as the densitized triad , by a flux operator @xmath148 , the whole electric field term can be written as @xmath149 which is then quantized to @xmath150    for the magnetic field term in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , at first sight , a different metric expression arises : @xmath151 which also involves inverse components when expressed in terms of the densitized triad .",
    "the term appears different from the electric field term and could thus be quantized differently .",
    "however , noting @xmath152 in terms of the magnetic field @xmath153 shows that the metric dependence is the same as in the electric part .",
    "we thus expect the same metric operator and correspondingly the same quantum gravity corrections in both terms , although different ones are mathematically possible owing to quantization ambiguities .",
    "the magnetic contribution to the maxwell hamiltonian then is @xmath154 with the magnetic flux @xmath155 .",
    "magnetic flux components @xmath156 are quantized using u(1 ) holonomies of the electromagnetic vector potential along closed loops transversal to the direction @xmath157 : @xmath158 we use the symbol @xmath159 to distinguish an electromagnetic holonomy @xmath159 from a gravitational one , @xmath160 .",

    "this aspect will be used in the following calculations .      as in @xcite",
    "we can include effects of the quantization of metric coefficients by inserting correction functions in the classical hamiltonian which follow , e.g. , from the eigenvalues @xcite @xmath170 ( where indices @xmath164 and @xmath165 are defined such that @xmath171 ) of operators @xmath172 .",
    "although for large @xmath128 these eigenvalues approach the function @xmath173 with a densitized triad @xmath174 and using the relation ( [ fluxvert ] ) between labels and flux components , they differ for values of @xmath128 closer to one .",
    "this deviation can , for an isotropic background , be captured in a single correction function @xmath175 which would equal one in the absence of quantum corrections .",
    "this is indeed approached in the limit where all @xmath176 , but for any finite values there are corrections . if all @xmath177 one can directly check that corrections are positive , i.e.  @xmath178 in this regime .",

    "there are other possible sources for corrections , such as higher order powers and higher derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields . but",
    "these terms would not be metric dependent and are thus not crucial for the following arguments .    now using ( [ modifiedhamiltonian ] ) , we get the modified expression @xmath185 depending on @xmath181 and @xmath182 . for a nearly isotropic background geometry , for instance ,",

    "interestingly , for @xmath181 = @xmath182 , the equation of state @xmath14 can easily be computed and is modified as @xmath189 this modification is independent of the specific matter dynamics as in the classical case , and it results in an equation of state which is linear in @xmath4 , but depends on the geometrical scales ( and the planck length ) through @xmath181 .",
    "in an isotropic and homogeneous universe ( frw ) , it follows from the frw metric and einstein s equation that the evolution of the energy density is given by the continuity equation , i.e. , @xmath190 where @xmath25 is the scale factor and the dot indicates a proper time derivative . using the definition of the equation of state and eliminating the time derivative",

    ", we use the number @xmath55 of lattice sites of elementary area @xmath200 in the hubble volume @xmath201 as a measure of how fine the lattice is . inserting all this in correction functions yields @xmath202 expressed purely in terms of",
    "coordinate independent quantities .",
    "the function @xmath55 enters as an additional ingredient to describe the microstructure of the underlying quantum state . in a given solution including the time dependence @xmath203 of the hubble scale as well as a function @xmath204 describing the quantum state one could relate all this , in a secondary step , to the scale factor @xmath205",
    "but since the scale factor is not the primary argument of correction functions , there is no problem with rescalings .",
    "see also @xcite for further clarifications of this issue which was not clear in all the literature on purely homogeneous models .",
    "we have derived here the equation of state of the maxwell field in a canonical form , including corrections expected from loop quantum gravity . in the canonical derivation ,",
    "the reason for a linear equation of state , which is trace - freedom in the lagrangean derivation , is the fact that the same metric dependent factor @xmath206 multiplies both terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the maxwell hamiltonian is thus simply rescaled if the metric is conformally transformed , which explains the conformal invariance of maxwell s equations .",
    "this is special for the maxwell field and different from , e.g. , a scalar field with a non - vanishing potential .",
    "the same fact allows one to quantize the hamiltonian in a way which affects both the electric and magnetic term in the same way , at least as far as the metric dependence is concerned .",
    "one then obtains a single correction function @xmath183 which only corrects the metric dependence of the total scale of the hamiltonian . in this sense ,",
    "conformal invariance is preserved even after quantization .",
    "( but this would not be the case if a quantization is used which results in @xmath184 . )",
    "this preservation of the form of the hamiltonian explains why we are still able to derive an equation of state independently of the specific field dynamics and that it remains linear .",
    "however , the classical value @xmath207 is corrected due to quantum effects in the space - time structure .",
    "this modification is also understandable from a lagrangean perspective , together with basic information from the loop quantization .",
    "employing trace freedom of the stress - energy tensor to derive the equation of state , we have to use the inverse metric in @xmath208 .",
    "but from loop quantum gravity we know that , when quantized , not all components of the inverse metric agree with inverse operators of the quantization . for the scale factor of an isotropic metric , for instance , we have @xmath209 since the right hand side is not even defined @xcite . while the left hand side is defined through identities such as ( [ poissonbracketofvolume ] ) , it satisfies @xmath210 and thus shows deviations from the classical expectation @xmath211 on small scales which were captured here in correction functions . as derived in detail , this implies scale dependent modifications to the equation of state parameter @xmath212 .",
    "the result can also be interpreted in more physical terms .",
    "the classical behavior @xmath29 can be understood as a combination of a dilution factor @xmath26 and an additional redshift factor @xmath213 for radiation in an expanding universe .",
    "as we have seen , this is corrected to @xmath214 where @xmath215 corrects the metric factor @xmath216 . since this is only a single inverse power of @xmath25 for an isotropic solution",
    ", we can interpret the result as saying that only redshift receives corrections due to quantum effects on electromagnetic propagation .",
    "the dilution factor due to expansion is unmodified , except that the background evolution @xmath205 itself receives corrections .",
    "this agrees with the result for dust , which is only diluted and has an unmodified equation of state even after quantization . unlike dust , for radiation one",
    "has to refer to the inhomogeneous field and its quantum hamiltonian to derive a reliable equation of state , as presented here .",
    "mb was supported by nsf grant phy0554771 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the equations of motion for the canonical variables @xmath33 and @xmath67 from the poisson brackets of each of these variables with the matter hamiltonian @xmath30 . then    @xmath217    and @xmath218 the modified hamiltonian gives rise to the following new set of equations of motion : @xmath219 and @xmath220    where @xmath221 is the effective hamiltonian of the maxwell s field ( @xmath30 with @xmath181 and @xmath182 inserted )",
    "the general , thermodynamical definition of pressure is the negative change of energy by volume , which we can write as @xmath222 whenever the hamiltonian @xmath223 is depends isotropically on the metric . otherwise , one has to use all components of the stress tensor @xmath224 which is not proportional to the identity .",
    "the derivative by the determinant of the metric can be expressed in terms of metric components by using a suitable change of variables which includes @xmath186 as an independent one .",
    "we thus introduce @xmath225 with @xmath226 such that @xmath227 where all components of @xmath228 are kept fixed in the partial derivative .",
    "this is exactly what we need to compute pressure since only the volume but not the shape of the fluid is varied .",
    "this change of variables implies @xmath229 and thus @xmath230    we can also verify this by comparing the dynamical effects of @xmath231 on the metric with the raychaudhuri equation expressed in terms of the canonical variables which for simplicity we do for homogeneous metrics . using the following definitions for the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath232 ( which turns out to be automatically spatial and symmetric without projection if homogeneity is used ) , the expansion parameter @xmath233 and the shear @xmath234 , the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath60 derived from the gravitational lagrangian is @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the gravitational constant .",
    "then the raychaudhuri equation in terms of the canonical variables takes the following form : @xmath237 the canonical equations of motion , in the presence of a matter hamiltonian @xmath231 added to the gravitational hamiltonian to form @xmath238 , become @xmath239 and      where @xmath241 is the derivative operator compatible with @xmath60 .",
    "variation of the total action with respect to the lapse function @xmath55 yields the hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath242 upon inserting equations ( [ qdot ] ) , ( [ pidot ] ) , and ( [ hconstraint ] ) into equation ( [ thetadot ] ) , the raychaudhuri equation becomes @xmath243 which , for a homogeneous universe , reduces to @xmath244 on the other hand , for a perfect fluid distribution , the raychaudhuri equation is found to be @xmath245 now comparing equation ( [ thetadot3 ] ) with equation ( [ thetadot4 ] ) , we verify the canonical formula for the average pressure for a perfect fluid distribution in an anisotropic geometry @xmath246                                          m. bojowald and a. skirzewski , in _ current mathematical topics in gravitation and cosmology ( 42nd karpacz winter school of theoretical physics ) _ , int .  j.  geom .  meth .  mod .",
