    "the large - scale radio structures however are not typically found to be aligned with the small scale jets @xcite .",
    "further , seyfert radio jets were found to be randomly aligned with respect to the host galaxy major axes @xcite .",
    "abrupt changes of jet axes were also found in some seyfert galaxies , e.g. , ngc  4151 @xcite and ngc  1068 @xcite .",
    "it appears that the radio structures in seyfert galaxis are more complex than in the radio galaxies .",
    "extensive discussions of large scale radio structures in seyfert galaxies can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mrk  6 is an early - type ( s0a ) seyfert 1.5 galaxy .",
    "it is also one of the seyfert galaxies that have radio emission on both small and large scales . using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt )",
    ", @xcite detected a pair of large weak  radio lobes \" extending northeast - southwest and a smaller scale radio structure extending east - west .",
    "high resolution merlin observations of the nuclear region by @xcite revealed a well - defined jet extending in the north - south direction .",
    "this jet is nearly aligned with the ionization cone reported earlier by @xcite , and the optical polarization position angle ( p.a . )",
    "derived through spectropolarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found some evidence of a pair of lobes on the sides of the jet which corresponded to the east - west radio structure observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , due to the relatively poor resolution of wsrt ( @xmath4 ) and the limited @xmath5@xmath6 coverage of merlin , few conclusions could be made on the relation between the three scales of radio emission in this source . in order to have a better understanding of the radio structures in mrk 6",
    ", we undertook a comprehensive radio study of mrk  6 with the very large array ( vla ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath7=71 km  s@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , at the redshift of @xmath10=0.01881 ( recession velocity @xmath05640  km  sec@xmath2 ) , or at the distance of 80.6 mpc for mrk  6 , 1  arcsec is equivalent to 377  parsecs .",
    "mrk  6 was observed with the vla at @xmath11  6  cm ( 4860 mhz ) and @xmath11  20  cm ( 1430 mhz ) during 19951996 .",
    "almost all vla configurations were used in the observations in order to image mrk  6 on different spatial scales .",
    "3c  286 was used as the primary flux density and polarization calibrator , while 0614 + 607 was used as the phase calibrator for the entire experiment .",
    "the data were processed with nrao s software package aips using the standard imaging and self - calibration procedures .",
    "table  [ tabobs ] lists the observing frequency , the corresponding bandwidth , the vla configuration , the observation date , the fwhms of the synthesized beams , the total flux densities of the source at various resolutions , and the _ r.m.s . _",
    "noise in the final maps .",
    ".[tabobs ] observation log [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to test the precession model , we derived a spectral age using the difference in the spectral index values taken from the two opposite edges of the eastern inner `` bubble '' ( marked ` new ' and ` old ' in fig .",
    "[ figprec ] , bottom right ) , under the assumption that the spectral steepening is a result of ageing . using the @xcite model for spectral ageing and following the analysis described in @xcite , we derived a radiative age of @xmath12 years , assuming an equipartition magnetic field of @xmath13 g ( table  [ tabenergetics ] ) .",
    "this estimate is a good match to the timescale the inner jet was `` on '' in the precessing jet model , providing further support to the model .",
    "the fractional polarization values along the edges of the bubbles range from 20% to 40% , values that are typically observed in agn jets .",
    "typical values for the measured polarization of supernova remnants , on the other hand , are less than 10% on all scales ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the polarized emission indicates that the southern side of the outer and the western side of the inner bubbles is more polarized than the opposite sides .",
    "however , the radio polarization seems to be anticorrelated with the presence of the emission - line gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggestive of depolarization of the northern and eastern bubble by ionized gas .",
    "such an anticorrelation has also been observed in some radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have estimated p@xmath14 for volume elements along the edges of the bubbles , assuming a volume filling factor of unity ( see table  [ tabenergetics ] ) . in the precessing jet scenario , these correspond to sections of the radio synchrotron jet .",
    "we find the minimum pressure to be @xmath15  dynes  @xmath16 and the minimum pressure magnetic field to be @xmath17 g for sections of the inner bubble edge . the minimum pressure and magnetic field strengths are lower by an order of magnitude in portions of the outer bubble edge .",
    "we find that these values are similar to those obtained for radio jets in radio galaxies @xcite and seyferts ( , * ? ? ?",
    "the 6  cm merlin image of mrk  6 reveals a gentle s - shaped knotty radio source ( easily reproduced in our precession model , see fig .",
    "[ figprec ] ) which has often been suggested to be the signature of a precessing jet .",
    "episodic ejection of material into a two - sided , precessing ( or wobbling ) , collimated outflow or jet has been proposed to explain the point - symmetric morphology of planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "specific examples include the pre - planetary nebulae iras 16342 - 3814 @xcite and hen 3 - 1475 @xcite , the planetary nebulae k3 - 35 @xcite and m2 - 9 @xcite , the agb star w43a @xcite , the symbiotic star ch cygni @xcite and herbig - haro type jets @xcite .    the s - shaped symmetry in jets has been observed in seyfert galaxies like mrk  3 , ngc  4151 , ngc  5256 , ngc  2685 and radio galaxies like 3c  305 , 3c  345 , 3c  294 , 3c  334 , and 3c  120 @xcite .",
    "most seyfert galaxies observed on arcsecond - scales , do not show extended jets @xcite .",
    "however when jet - like features are observed , they more often than not , exhibit a curved geometry @xcite .",
    "indeed , 8 or s - shaped radio structures , sometimes along with large misalignments between radio structures on different spatial scales have been observed in the seyfert galaxies ngc  2992 , ngc  3079 , ngc  5548 , ngc  4051 , ngc  6764 , ngc  2110 , ngc  4151 , ngc  7469 @xcite",
    ".    further support for the precessing jet model comes from the emission line images obtained with the hubble space telescope @xcite , where the [ oiii ] and [ oii ] emission of mrk  6 follows the curve of the s - shaped jet far into the southern edge of the inner bubble .",
    "it would be difficult to explain this assymmetry in emission - line morphology with an expanding shell of starburst superwinds .",
    "the entire narrow - line region itself extends much beyond the extent of the radio source .",
    "a similar curvature in the narrow - line region and an enlr much larger than the radio source have been observed in the seyfert 2 galaxy , mrk  3 @xcite and the radio galaxy 3c  305 @xcite .",
    "similar to the suggestions made for these galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we interpret that the small - scale emission - line region is powered by the radio jets while the enlr may be ionized by the radiation from the nucleus . however , in keeping with the picture of an episodic precessing jet , it is possible that some of the emission in the enlr is a result of an earlier interaction with the radio jet .",
    "therefore , based on all the above findings , we believe that the complex radio morphology of mrk  6 can be understood in terms of an episodically - powered precessing jet .",
    "mrk  6 may therefore be a unique object only in the sense that we are able to observe the source in its short - lived phase of episodic activity and before its radio emission from the previous epoch has faded away .",
    "hence , similar radio structures may be found in other seyfert galaxies going through such a phase , and when they are observed with sufficient resolution and sensitivity to image the relic emission from an earlier phase of activity .",
    "an episodically - powered precessing jet model in seyfert galaxies implies that radio activity is a short - lived phenomenon in the lifetime of a seyfert galaxy .",
    "further , multiple episodes of ejection are possible .",
    "these might be caused by independent accretion events .",
    "based on the fraction of spiral galaxies which are seyferts , @xcite estimated the statistical seyfert lifetime to be of the order of @xmath18 yrs .",
    "further , based on the physical extents of the narrow emission line regions and radio jets , sanders concluded that seyfert nuclear activity must be short - lived stochastic accretion events with no single episode lasting longer than @xmath19 yrs .",
    "although the estimate of the fraction of seyferts in spirals has increased from a few percent to @xmath20 following more recent surveys @xcite , thereby increasing the statistical lifetime to @xmath21 yrs , the episode lifetime remains the same .",
    "random jet orientations in seyferts occur , in his picture , because each accretion event is accompanied by its own independent accretion disk in no preferred plane .",
    "based on the nicmos imaging of a large sample of seyfert galaxies , @xcite also reached the conclusion that seyfert activity may be prompted by a disturbance .",
    "the precessing jet model further implies that the jet ejection axis is easily perturbed in seyferts .",
    "an accretion disk which is irradiated by a central agn can become unstable to becoming warped , resulting in the wobbling of the jet @xcite and severe misalignment of the jet axis and the axis of the outer accretion disk .",
    "apart from radiative feedback that may warp a rotating accretion disk , jet precession could arise due to near - eddington accretion events that may alter the spin of the supermassive black hole , in turn affecting the orientation of the radio jet @xcite ; binary blackholes @xcite and blackhole mergers , that might result in short timescale redirection of the jet axis @xcite . possibly due to the smaller blackhole masses in seyfert galaxies",
    "compared to typical radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spinning blackhole axis and consequently the radio jet axis is perturbed easily when accretion events take place , resulting in precessing jets and switches in jet - orientation .    it must be noted that the host galaxy of mrk  6 shows no conspicuous signatures of galaxy - galaxy interaction or merger - activity , which could lead to a binary black hole in the centre ( , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , mrk  6 seems to be located in a sparse environment @xcite , although the possibility of a major merger more than a dynamical timescale ( @xmath22 yrs ) ago , can not be ruled out .",
    "note that the emission - line region in mrk  6 is extended along more than one axis ( fig .",
    "[ figwfpc ] ) .",
    "however , as @xcite point out from their study on ` winged ' radio galaxies , there remain two possibilities that could result in jet realignment without a second black hole .",
    "( 1 ) an ingested dwarf galaxy may not leave observable traces that a larger merger would , and yet provide adequate mass and angular momentum to cause jet re - orientation .",
    "( 2 ) the jet axis may not be determined by the black hole alignment , but be strongly influenced by the accretion disk .",
    "instabilities in the inner disk could then cause switching of the jet direction over short timescales .",
    "a consequence of the changes in jet orientation is that the jet may interact with the molecular torus , stirring up the constituent matter .",
    "this would be consistent with the variable absorbing gas column density inferred through xmm - newton x - ray spectroscopic observations of the central regions of mrk  6 by @xcite .",
    "we have carried out an extensive radio study with the vla on the seyfert 1.5 galaxy mrk  6 and imaged a spectacular radio structure in the source .",
    "the radio emission occurs on three different spatial scales , from @xmath07.5  kpc bubbles to @xmath01.5  kpc bubbles and a @xmath01  kpc radio jet , all lying roughly orthogonal to each other .",
    "all the radio structures appear to originate from near the agn core .",
    "we have considered three models to explain the complex radio morphology of mrk  6 . in the first model , we have suggested that the bubble - like radio structures are the result of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst .",
    "however , recent spitzer observations of mrk  6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate of @xmath1  yr@xmath2 , an estimate lower by an order of magnitude than the sfr of @xmath3  yr@xmath2 derived assuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by supernovae explosions .",
    "thus , a starburst alone can not meet the energy requirements for the creation of the bubbles in mrk  6 .",
    "we have also considered a model wherein the bubbles are a result of diverted agn - driven jets .",
    "the small - scale radio jet gets diverted and decelerated through its interaction with the surrounding interstellar medium , thereby depositing all its energy into the ism in about @xmath23 years .",
    "the energetics however , do not favour the agn - driven single plasmon model proposed by @xcite .    in the third model , we attribute the complex radio structure to be the result of an episodically - powered precessing jet that changes orientation .",
    "the attraction of this model is that it can naturally explain the complex radio morphology .",
    "it is also consistent with the energetics , the spectral index , and the polarization structure .",
    "recent xmm - newton x - ray observations of a variable absorbing gas column density could be inferred as in - keeping - with the changing jet orientation in mrk  6 which causes the jet to interact with the torus , thereby stirring up the gas / dust .",
    "radio emission in this scenario is short - lived phenomenon in the lifetime of a seyfert galaxy which results due to an accretion event .",
    "further , possibly due to the smaller blackhole masses in seyferts compared to typical radio galaxies , the spinning blackhole axis and consequently the radio jet axis is perturbed easily when accretion events take place , resulting in precessing jets and switches in orientation .",
    "multi - wavelength comprehensive radio studies of seyfert galaxies would therefore reveal many more sources with similar complex radio structures as mrk  6 .",
