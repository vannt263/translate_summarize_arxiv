    "in the high @xmath15 superconductors a close interplay between superconductivity and magnetism exists .",
    "the parent compounds of the cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators .",
    "doping with holes or electrons destroys the long range order but antiferromagnetic correlations persist even in the superconducting region .",
    "_ inelastic _ incommensurate magnetic peaks in superconducting @xmath16 ( lsco ) show that superconductivity and magnetic correlations coexist@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has regained attraction since in 1995 _ elastic _ peaks at the same incommensurate positions were found in @xmath17 .",
    "these elastic peaks are interpreted in terms of hole ",
    "rich and spin  rich domains in the @xmath6layers , i.e. the well known stripe picture@xcite . in lsco ( t  phase ) doping with nd induces a further low temperature phase transition for @xmath18 . for x = 0",
    "there is a transition from the low temperature orthorhombic lto to the less orthorhombic pccn phase@xcite whereas for @xmath19 the transition is to the tetragonal ltt phase . in the latter superconductivity",
    "is strongly suppressed for certain sr concentrations@xcite . in the ltt phase",
    "the tilt of the @xmath20octahedra can serve as pinning potential for the dynamical stripe correlations .",
    "hence , the inelastic peaks become elastic indicating a formation of _ static _ anti phase antiferromagnetic domains in the @xmath21planes which are separated by quasi one  dimensional stripes containing the doped charge carriers .",
    "recently , inelastic incommensurate peaks have also been observed in superconducting @xmath22@xcite giving rise to the question whether stripes are a general feature of cuprate based high @xmath15 superconductors .",
    "in addition to the investigation of the cu subsystem , the dynamics of the nd spins in @xmath23 ( ncco , @xmath24phase ) has been examined extensively by several groups@xcite .",
    "henggeler et al.@xcite performed neutron scattering experiments to examine the spin excitation spectrum at low temperatures .",
    "the same group explained the heavy fermion like large @xmath25 coefficient in low temperature specific heat measurements@xcite of ncco by the shift of spectral weight of the nd modes to lower energies with increasing number of charge carriers@xcite .",
    "specific heat measurements show a schottky anomaly in the parent compound @xmath26@xcite .",
    "this is explained by the presence of nd  cu interactions being responsible for the splitting of the @xmath9 ground state kramers doublet as e.g. observed in raman and neutron scattering experiments@xcite . at higher temperatures in neutron scattering experiments on powder samples of ncco@xcite and on a single crystal of @xmath26@xcite a quasielastic ( qe ) lorentzian",
    "is observed with a line width that increases almost linearly with increasing temperature . at lower temperatures the line shape turns into a gaussian with an almost constant line width .",
    "similar features have been presented for @xmath27@xcite . in this compound",
    "the qe gaussian and the lorentzian coexist .    in the present work we report on inelastic magnetic neutron scattering experiments on @xmath0 at various temperatures .",
    "we have investigated the 4f magnetic response for samples with sr ",
    "concentrations @xmath1 and nd  concentrations @xmath2 at low energies ( typically @xmath28 ) in order to obtain information about the cu magnetism in the @xmath6layers via the nd  cu interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as the next chapter describes the experimental technique .",
    "the presentation of our results and their discussion follows in chapter iii which is divided into two parts as justified by our experimental findings . in section iv we will give a brief summary .",
    "we performed temperature dependent studies on @xmath29 , @xmath10 ( x = 0 , 0.12 , 0.15 , 0.2 ) and @xmath30 ( x = 0.1 , 0.12 , 0.15 , 0.18 , 0.2 ) using the time  of  flight ( tof ) spectrometers v3 neat@xcite ( hmi berlin ) , g6.2 mibemol ( llb saclay ) and in5 ( ill grenoble ) .",
    "all spectrometers are located at cold neutron beam lines and use chopper systems for monochromatization which give very sharp and clean resolution functions . the energy chosen for the incident neutrons ranges from @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) resulting in energy resolutions between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( hwhm ) , respectively .",
    "additionally , @xmath37 was measured at the in6 ( ill , grenoble ) with @xmath38 ( @xmath39)@xcite . this spectrometer uses bragg diffraction on single crystals to monochromize the neutron beam . in all cases a vanadium standard for calibration and an empty can measurement of the al flat plate for background correction were carried out .",
    "for the experiments we used well characterized powder samples@xcite of typically m = 20  g and a standard cryostat for cooling .",
    "details of the data analysis are described elsewhere@xcite . since we could not find any q  dependence of the magnetic signals @xmath40",
    "is averaged over a broad q ",
    "window for all spectra to obtain a better statistics .",
    "in all samples a quasielastic line of lorentzian shape is observed at high temperatures .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ prb001 ] showing spectra of @xmath41 for two different temperatures .",
    "the line width @xmath42 of the lorentzian decreases with decreasing temperature and shows the _ same _ temperature dependence in _ all _ compounds within experimental error . in fig .",
    "[ prb002 ] the temperature dependence of the qe line width for samples with different sr and nd  concentrations is plotted . above about 100  k the line width increases almost linearly with increasing temperature . below this temperature",
    "the slope is drastically reduced although the line width decreases furthermore on lowering the temperature .",
    "the residual line width for @xmath43 is below the resolution limit even in the experiments when an energy resolution of @xmath44 ( hwhm ) was chosen .",
    "generally , it is hard to detect the qe lorentzian for @xmath45 .",
    "however , when we do not include a qe lorentzian in our fitting procedure we observe an increase of the elastic intensity in this temperature region . since the coherent and incoherent elastic scattering intensity should be almost temperature independent for each sample we can conclude that this additional intensity originates from magnetic scattering . if the fit for the qe lorentzian yielded a value smaller than half of the resolution ( hwhm ) we fixed the line width at @xmath46 for this temperature .",
    "[ prb001 ]    the qe line width is related to the spin fluctuation frequency via @xmath47 .",
    "thus the decrease of the line width with decreasing temperature is a direct evidence for the lowering of the 4f  spin fluctuation frequency .",
    "the observation of a magnetic qe line in high @xmath15 superconductors and related materials has been a subject for discussion for over a decade@xcite . during this time",
    "two attempts to describe the 4f spin relaxation , i.e. the temperature dependence of the qe line width , were suggested :    * via the interaction of 4f spins with conduction electron spins * by exchange interaction between 4f spins themselves    in the first case the line width should increase linearly with temperature as @xmath48 ^ 2 \\cdot t$ ] ( korringa law ) with @xmath49 the density of electron states at the fermi energy and @xmath50 the exchange integral between 4f and conduction electron spins@xcite .",
    "such a temperature dependence was often found in intermetallic systems@xcite . in the second case",
    "a power law is expected@xcite .",
    "[ prb002 ]    from our data we can exclude both cases , since we observe the same temperature dependence of @xmath42 in samples with ( @xmath51 ) and without charge carriers ( @xmath52 ) which rules out scenario ( i ) . again , the same temperature dependence of @xmath42 is obtained for samples with high nd content ( y = 0.6 ) and low nd content ( y = 0.1 ) . for a small nd concentration the nd ",
    "nd exchange interaction should be weak , which rules out scenario ( ii ) . after a detailed analysis of our data we found that the relaxation of the 4f  spins can be well described with a two  phonon orbach process@xcite assuming a coupling between crystal field ( cf ) excitations and phonons .",
    "the orbach process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ orbachproz ] . in this relaxation process",
    "a nd ion which is in state @xmath53 can absorb a phonon and hence is excited to state @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) . from this state",
    "it can fall down to state @xmath56 by emitting a second phonon .",
    "the temperature dependence of the qe line width then follows @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the energy of an excited crystal field state and c is a factor which among others considers the coupling of the cf ground state with the excited cf state . in equation ( [ gleichung ] ) only for @xmath59 the line width is proportional to the temperature .",
    "we fit this function to the experimental data of many different samples and obtained values around 200  k for @xmath58 .",
    "since the energy of the excited cf state should not differ much between our samples , we took a mean value of @xmath60 in the following .",
    "unfortunately , the crystal field scheme for nd doped lsco has yet not been evaluated .",
    "however , @xmath61 coincides roughly with the energy of the first excited state ( @xmath62 ) in @xmath26@xcite .",
    "a fit with equation ( [ gleichung ] ) reveals @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath41 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "a residual line width of @xmath66 has also been taken into account but does not influence the other parameters markedly@xcite .",
    "the values for c are in the expected range@xcite and are in good agreement with the reported value for lsco probed with @xmath67 spins@xcite .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the relevance of the orbach relaxation process in other systems .",
    "a comparison of the qe line widths in @xmath0 with the reported values in @xmath26@xcite and @xmath68@xcite shows that the absolute values of @xmath69 are of the same order of magnitude in all compounds .",
    "for @xmath26 only a few data points of the qe line width exist .",
    "the agreement between the data of casalta et al . for a single crystal and loewenhaupt et al . for a powder sample is rather poor .",
    "a fit with the above function yields @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 for the data of loewenhaupt et al . and casalta et al .",
    ", respectively ( @xmath58 was fixed at 175  k ) . note that in both cases a large residual line width is obtained from the fit .",
    "this broad lorentzian line is probably masked by the broad gaussian line .",
    "a large value of @xmath74 was directly observed in @xmath27@xcite .",
    "a fit of the data on @xmath75 with eq .",
    "( [ gleichung ] ) reveals @xmath76 ( @xmath74 and @xmath58 fixed at 0.235  mev and 410  k@xcite , respectively ) .",
    "two things are worth mentioning .",
    "firstly , the choice of 410  k for @xmath58 has the consequence that the increase of the line width is suppressed up to higher temperatures .",
    "this is indeed observed in @xmath27@xcite .",
    "secondly , c is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than in @xmath0 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations of shimizu et al . for an @xmath67 spin probe in lsco and ybco@xcite .",
    "the broad residual line width in the concentrated systems might be caused by a strongly enhanced nd ",
    "nd interaction .    a qe lorentzian",
    "was also observed in @xmath77@xcite and @xmath78@xcite . in both compounds",
    "tb has a quasi ",
    "doublet ground state , i.e. two singlets separated by only a few @xmath79 .",
    "it was found that in @xmath80 the temperature dependence of @xmath81 obeys a power law @xmath82 with @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "conclusively the authors claimed that the rare  earth exchange interaction might be the dominant process for the 4f  spin relaxation .",
    "the same group obtained similar results for @xmath84@xcite .",
    "since the concentration of tb in this compound is very low the above interpretation of a strong rare  earth exchange interaction seems rather unlikely .",
    "in contrast , a very recent reanalysis of the data showed that the temperature dependence of the qe line width also follows the two  phonon orbach process@xcite .",
    "taking all these facts into account it seems reasonable to assume that the 4f spin relaxation in high @xmath15 superconductors and related materials is caused by cf transitions assisted by phonons and _ not _ by interaction with conduction electrons .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the deviation from a linear temperature dependence of @xmath42 as opening of a gap has to be reexamined@xcite .    to conclude this section we want to mention that a coupling between these two elementary excitations was already reported in raman scattering studies on several high @xmath15 superconductors and related compounds@xcite",
    "furthermore , esr data have been discussed in terms of an orbach process@xcite .",
    "these data are consistent with our interpretation of the temperature dependence of the qe line width ( see also our previous work  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the above described behavior the 4f magnetic response at low temperatures correlates with the electronic properties of the @xmath6layers . depending on the dopant concentration we find different features of the magnetic response which we will now discuss in detail . + * x = 0 * + in insulating @xmath7 with y = 0.1 , 0.3 the 4f magnetic response changes from a qe lorentzian to an inelastic ( ine ) excitation below about 80  k@xcite ( see fig . [ prb003 ] ) .",
    "this ine excitation clearly indicates the splitting of the @xmath9 ground state kramers doublet due to the internal exchange field of ordered cu moments and shows the strong interaction between the cu and nd  subsystems .",
    "although the cu ordering temperature is much higher , this excitation becomes first detectable below 80  k since at higher temperature the line width is larger than the observed energy splitting .",
    "we mention that this is in contrast to neutron scattering results on @xmath26 where the magnetic signal remains qe down to 5  k@xcite possibly due to nd  nd interactions . for the sample with smaller nd content , namely @xmath29",
    ", we find a similar behavior as for y = 0.3 .",
    "in contrast to y = 0.3 in this sample only a minority fraction of about 20 % changes to the pccn phase@xcite .",
    "[ prb003 ]    [ prb004 ]    the temperature dependence of the energy splitting for both compounds is plotted in fig .",
    "[ prb004 ] .",
    "an increase of the splitting , i.e. of the internal exchange field at the nd site , is clearly visible .",
    "our findings agree roughly with the data of chou et al.@xcite who measured the internal field at the la site in @xmath85 with @xmath86 nqr . according to their results the temperature dependence of the internal field",
    "can be described with a power law @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "this means an increase of about 17% from 80  k to 3  k and agrees roughly with our results in @xmath29 .",
    "it is obvious that the exchange field at the nd site is influenced by both , the staggered magnetization and the direction of the cu spins . in @xmath90",
    "the structural transition from @xmath91 is accompanied by a cu spin reorientation@xcite .",
    "thus , the enhanced splitting in y = 0.3 compared to y = 0.1 for @xmath43 might be due to the difference in the direction of the cu spins .",
    "finally , we want to mention that the value of @xmath92 coincides with that derived from the schottky anomaly found in low temperature specific heat measurements@xcite . + * x = 0.12 * + static ordering of charges and spins was first reported in @xmath17@xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained for x = 0.15@xcite where magnetic order has also been observed with @xmath93experiments@xcite and mssbauer experiments@xcite .",
    "[ prb004a ]    we performed measurements on several compounds related to this composition and found similar properties at low temperatures .",
    "as a representative sample we chose @xmath94 to explain the general features that are observed when the type of ordering changes from the well known spin structure for x = 0 into an antiferromagnetic stripe pattern of ordered spins and charges in the @xmath6layers . above the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature ( @xmath95 ) a single qe lorentzian line is found as discussed in section a. when the temperature is further lowered below @xmath96 the line width",
    "does not become smaller as expected from the two  phonon orbach process . instead ,",
    "a broad magnetic response of almost constant width centered around the elastic peak is visible ( see fig . [ prb004a ] ) .",
    "the analysis of our results shows that in addition to the lorentzian a gaussian line is necessary to accurately describe the data .",
    "the width of this gaussian is almost temperature independent ( @xmath97 , see fig .",
    "[ prb005 ] ) .",
    "[ prb005 ]    the observation of a broad qe gaussian line instead of a well resolved ine excitation as for x = 0 infers a distribution of different energy splittings on different nd sites .",
    "this is a direct hint on spatial inhomogeneities in the @xmath6planes and is probably caused by the formation of stripes . in this picture the kramers doublet of a @xmath9 ion , which is located near a charge stripe and thus is not split up , contributes to the lorentzian signal which is still observable ( at least the splitting must be small compared to the width of this lorentzian ) . the comparison of the width of the gaussian line in @xmath98 with the energy excitation of the inelastic line ( x = 0 ) reveals a reduced ( average ) splitting , which is related to a reduced zero temperature staggered magnetization in the @xmath6planes",
    "this finding coincides with the @xmath99experiments@xcite on @xmath100 where a decrease of the muon spin rotation frequency compared to @xmath101@xcite was found .",
    "this was interpreted as a decrease of the average magnetic field at the muon site in sr doped compounds .    in fig .",
    "[ prb006 ] the intensities of the lorentzian and gaussian signals are plotted versus temperature . above 50",
    "k the intensity of the single lorentzian line raises with decreasing temperature due to an increase in the thermal occupation of the ground state ( not shown ) .",
    "below this temperature firstly the intensity of the lorentzian decreases linearly for @xmath102 whereas the intensity of the gaussian raises .",
    "this can be interpreted as a decrease in the number of paramagnetic nd ions ( i.e. with a splitting smaller than the lorentzian line width ) .",
    "this is expected since the lorentzian line width decreases with decreasing temperature and therefore the number of nd ions for which the above condition holds reduces .",
    "secondly , between 10  k and 3  k , a plateau  like level is reached . for @xmath103",
    "the lorentzian line width is well below the resolution limit and so small that we can not distinguish between a lorentzian line and the elastic line . finally , below 3",
    "k a strong increase of the lorentzian intensity ( which we can not distinguish from an increase of the elastic intensity ) is observed . at a similar temperature a pronounced increase of the magnetic intensity due to ordering of the nd moments was reported in @xmath17@xcite .",

    "in contrast to @xmath10 all of these samples lie in the region of the phase diagram where superconductivity is strongly suppressed@xcite and thus a broad magnetic response at low temperatures is expected .",

    "[ prb007 ] ( these data points are fits under the assumption that @xmath106 is temperature independent for each compound ) .",

    "this observation is consistent with the findings in @xmath107 with x = 0.12 , 0.15 and 0.2@xcite .",
    "[ prb007 ]    unfortunately the spectra of @xmath108 showed strongly enhanced background probably due the diffusion of air into the neutron flight path .",

    "30  k although it is accurate enough at certain temperatures .",

    "could not find any hints for magnetic order in a recent @xmath112experiment@xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the absence of a qe broadening is surprising in the compound with y = 0.6 because superconductivity is strongly suppressed and hence a broad magnetic response is expected .",
    "our sample has also been studied in a recent @xmath113experiment which shows magnetic order below about 15  k@xcite .",
    "this finding seems to contradict our neutron scattering results .",
    "there might be two reasons why a broadening is not observable in the present neutron scattering experiment : ( i ) the splitting of the nd kramers ground state is too small or ( ii ) the intensity of the qe gaussian is too low . from the energy resolution chosen in our experiment we can conclude that a possible average splitting of the nd ground state must be below @xmath114 if case ( i ) were true .",
    "this contradicts the value which is obtained by extrapolating the gaussian widths of fig .",
