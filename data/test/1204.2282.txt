    "let @xmath1 be a probability measure supported on an infinite subset @xmath2 of the real line .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 for every nonnegative number @xmath0 .",
    "a sequence of monic polynomials @xmath4 is said to be orthogonal with respect to @xmath1 when deg @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "it is very well known that these polynomials satisfy a three term recurrence relation that yields for the orthonormalized polynomials a symmetric tridiagonal ( jacobi ) matrix such that the eigenvalues of the @xmath0 leading principal submatrix are the zeros of the polynomial @xmath8 . as a straightforward consequence of this fact the zeros of @xmath8 are real , simple and interlace with the zeros of @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "they are located in the interior of the convex hull of @xmath2 .",
    "+ the theory of orthogonal polynomials is strongly related to sturm - liouville problems . in particular , the so called classical orthogonal polynomials ( hermite , laguerre , and jacobi ) appear as eigenfunctions of second order linear differential operators with polynomial coefficients .",
    "indeed , the corresponding measure of orthogonality is absolutely continuous and their derivative with respect to the lebesgue measure ( weight function ) is the density function of the normal , gamma and beta distributions , respectively .",
    "notice that this fact was pointed out by e. routh in 1884 @xcite as well as by s. bochner in 1929 @xcite , but the orthogonality does not play therein any role . on the other hand , they are hypergeometric functions and , as a consequence , many analytic properties can be deduced from this fact . moreover",
    ", certain properties of their zeros can be easily deduced using the classical sturm theorems .",
    "finally , a nice electrostatic interpretation of their zeros is deduced from the second order linear differential equation as an equilibrium problem for the logarithmic interaction of positive unit charges under an external field .",
    "+ exceptional orthogonal polynomials constitute a recent new approach to spectral problems for second order linear differential operators with polynomial eigenfunctions .",
    "previously , a constructive theory of orthogonal polynomials related to the classical ones has been done in two directions .",
    "the first one is related to the spectral theory of higher order linear differential operators with polynomial coefficients . for fourth order differential operators the classification of their eigenfunctions , which are sequences of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a nontrivial probability measure supported on an infinite subset of the real line , was done by h. l. krall and a. m. krall @xcite and essentially yields the classical ones and perturbations of some particular laguerre weights @xmath10 , jacobi weights @xmath11 and legendre weight @xmath12 , @xmath13 . for higher order ,",
    "some examples are known but a general theory and classification constitutes an open problem .",
    "the second one appears when some perturbations of the measure are considered . in particular ,",
    "three cases are considered in the literature in the framework of the so called spectral linear transformations @xcite . the christoffel transformation ( the multiplication of the measure by a positive polynomial in the support of the measure ) , the uvarov transformation ( the addition of mass points off the support of the measure ) and geronimus transformation ( the multiplication by the inverse of a positive polynomial ) .",
    "they can be analyzed in terms of the discrete darboux transformation of the corresponding jacobi matrices using the lu and ul factorizations and commuting them @xcite .",
    "+ exceptional orthogonal polynomials depart from the classical families in that the sequence of exceptional polynomials is not required to contain a polynomial of every degree , and as a consequence new differential operators exist , with _ rational _ rather than polynomial coefficients . despite this fact , the sequence of exceptional polynomial eigenfunctions is still dense in the corresponding weighted @xmath14 space and constitutes an orthogonal polynomial system .",
    "the measure of orthogonality for the exceptional families is a classical measure divided by the square of a polynomial with zeros outside the support of the measure .",
    "the first explicit examples of families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials are the @xmath15-jacobi and @xmath15-laguerre polynomials , which are of codimension one , and were first introduced in @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "a characterization theorem was proved for these orthogonal polynomial families , realizing them as the unique complete codimension one families defined by a sturm - liouville problem .",
    "one of the key steps in the proof was the determination of normal forms for the flags of univariate polynomials of codimension one in the space of all such polynomials , and the determination of the second - order linear differential operators which preserve these flags @xcite .",
    "shortly after , quesne @xcite observed the presence of a relationship between exceptional orthogonal polynomials and the darboux transformation .",
    "this enabled her to obtain examples of potentials corresponding to orthogonal polynomial families of codimension two , as well as explicit families of @xmath16 polynomials .",
    "higher - codimensional families were first obtained by odake and sasaki @xcite .",
    "the same authors further showed the existence of two families of @xmath17-laguerre and @xmath17-jacobi polynomials @xcite , the existence of which was explained in @xcite for @xmath17-laguerre polynomials and in @xcite for @xmath17-jacobi polynomials , through the application of the isospectral algebraic darboux transformation first introduced in @xcite .",
    "these exceptional orthogonal polynomials have been applied in a number of interesting physical contexts , such as dirac operators minimally coupled to external fields , @xcite , entropy measures in quantum information theory , @xcite , rational extensions of morse and kepler - coulomb problems , @xcite or discrete quantum mechanics , @xcite .",
    "the aim of our contribution is to explore analytic properties of these exceptional polynomials . in particular we will focus our attention in the distribution of their zeros in terms of the support of the orthogonality measure as well as their limit behavior . on the other hand",
    ", we will analyze some asymptotic properties as the outer relative asymptotics in terms of the corresponding classical orthogonal polynomials and the mehler - heine type formulas .",
    "some properties of the zeros have also been analyzed numerically in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be a positive weight function with finite moments .",
    "usually , orthogonal polynomials are defined by applying gram - schmidt orthogonalization to the standard flag @xmath19 relative to an @xmath14 inner product associated with the weight @xmath20 . moreover ,",
    "if the resulting orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a sturm - liouville problem , we speak of classical orthogonal polynomials . by bochner s theorem ,",
    "the range of such polynomials is limited to the classical families of hermite , laguerre , and jacobi ( for positive weights ) and bessel ( for signed weights ) .    in order to go beyond the classical families , we consider orthogonal polynomials spanning a non - standard polynomial flag , say with a basis @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "once we drop the assumption that the op sequence contains a polynomial _ of every degree _ , we obtain new classes of orthogonal polynomials defined by sturm - liouville problems , which are commonly referred to as exceptional orthogonal polynomials ( xops ) and contains every integer @xmath23 is not essential either , although all the families treated in this paper belong to this class .",
    "there exist also xops where the degree sequence has gaps .",
    "they are related to state - adding darboux transformations ( as opposed to isospectral ) and contain for instance the @xmath24-hermite families , beside many others . ] .    in the last two years",
    "it has become clear that the darboux transformation , appropriately generalized to the polynomial context , plays an essential part in the deliniation of xops . to wit ,",
    "let @xmath25 denote the vector space of polynomials of degree @xmath26 , and consider a codimension @xmath27 polynomial flag @xmath28 furthermore , let @xmath29 = b(z)(y'-w(z ) y),\\quad b[y]= \\hat{b}(z)(y'-\\hat{w}(z)y)\\ ] ] be first order linear differential operators with rational coefficients such that @xmath30 = u_k,\\quad a[u_k ] = { \\mathcal{p}}_{k-1},\\qquad k=1,2,\\dots\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath31 maps the standard flag into the codimension @xmath27 flag while @xmath32 maps the codimension @xmath27 into the standard flag .",
    "note that equation implies that @xmath33 and the darboux transformation is isospectral .",
    "next , consider the second order differential operators @xmath34 by construction , @xmath35 leaves invariant the standard polynomial flag , while @xmath36 leaves invariant the codimension-@xmath27 flag @xmath37 .",

    "it is then assured that @xmath35 and @xmath42 have polynomial eigenfunctions and @xmath31 , the term _ eigenfunction _ is not meant in the strict spectral theoretic sense here , but rather as polynomial solutions to the eigenvalue equation . ] .",

    "again , by construction we have the following intertwining relations @xmath47 which mean that @xmath48 = \\beta_j \\hat{y}_{j+m},\\quad a[\\hat{y}_{j+m } ] = \\alpha_j    y_j,\\quad j=0,1,2,\\ldots,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are constants , i.e. operator @xmath32 maps eigenfunctions of @xmath35 into eigenfunctions of @xmath42 while @xmath31 does the opposite transformation .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath50 be the solutions of the pearson s equations @xmath51 this means that @xmath44 $ ] is formally self - adjoint relative to @xmath20 while @xmath46 $ ] is formally self - adjoint relative to @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , the eigenpolynomials @xmath53 are formally orthogonal with respect to the weight @xmath18 , while @xmath54 are formally orthogonal relative to @xmath55 .",
    "one can also show that @xmath56 g w dz + \\int b[g ] f \\hat{w } dz = \\text { boundary      term};\\ ] ] which means that operators @xmath32 and @xmath57 are formally adjoint . by a careful choice of the flags , and by",
    "imposing appropriate boundary conditions one can construct examples where the above formal relations hold in the @xmath14 setting ( i.e. boundary conditions such that the boundary terms vanish ) and thereby obtain novel classes of exceptional orthogonal polynomials .    in the present note we study asymptotic behaviour of xops of laguerre and jacobi types .",
    "as we show , in the interval of orthogonality the exceptional polynomials satisfy a variant of the classical heine - mehler formula . outside the interval of orthogonality ,",
    "the convergence picture is less clear .",
    "however , one can show that codimension @xmath27 exceptional orthogonal polynomials possess @xmath27 extra zeros outside the interval of orthogonality , which we shall denote as _",
