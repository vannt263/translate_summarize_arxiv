    "production of charged particles with energies far exceeding the thermal energy is known to be a very common phenomenon in cosmic plasma .",
    "such energetic particles , which include interplanetary , interstellar and galactic cosmic rays , are believed to be produced in various astrophysical bodies , from magnetospheric to cosmic plasmas , including solar flares , coronal mass ejections ( cme ) and supernova remnants . in other words ,",
    "acceleration of charged particles occurs ubiquitously in the plasma universe .",
    "investigations of particle energization remains a major topic of astrophysics .",
    "the seminal paper in this field is by fermi  @xcite , who proposed that charged particles in cosmic rays can attain very high energies by being repeatedly reflected by two magnetic mirrors moving towards each other .",
    "fermi s idea of energization was tested in a simple setting in the now - famous fermi - ulam model @xcite whose numerical simulations showed that , although the motion of a particle reflected by moving walls can be chaotic , on average no energy is gained by the particle if the motion of the moving wall is a smooth function of time .",
    "this result was elaborated upon in the early days of research in nonlinear dynamical systems  @xcite , to show that energy can grow as a power law in time if the motion of the wall is not smooth in time , e.g. , random or a saw - tooth profile in time .",
    "the fermi - ulam problem in more than one dimension , sometimes called `` billiard problems with breathing walls '' , allow energization of particles ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review . in some specially constructed cases ,",
    "even exponential - in - time energy growth is possible  @xcite .",
    "such problems , although of fundamental interest , are somewhat removed from the problem of energization of charged particles in time - dependent magnetic fields . in this paper",
    ", we show that the energy of charged particles can increase as a power law in time in a simple helical magnetic field , whose components are slowly varying sinusoidal functions of both space and time .",
    "the motion of a charged particle in deceptively simple magnetic fields can be very complex , even chaotic .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite has shown that very simple current configurations , for example a circular current loop in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane plus a line current along the @xmath3 axis passing through an off - center point , can give rise to a magnetic field whose magnetic lines of force are non - integrable and chaotic .",
    "the motion of a charged particle in such a chaotic magnetic field may or may not be chaotic .",
    "recently , it was conjectured @xcite that , if such a chaotic magnetic field changes with time , it may be able to impart significant energy to a charged particle .",
    "our work , described below , demonstrates the feasibility of effective energization of charged particles by a time - varying chaotic magnetic field .",
    "we show that this process can lead to an indefinite energization of a charged particle to relativistic energies , given enough time .",
    "it is now generally accepted that astrophysical magnetic fields are generated by some dynamo mechanism , i.e. , a mechanism by which the kinetic energy of the fluid is converted to magnetic energy  @xcite .",
    "if the characteristic length scale of the magnetic field , generated by the dynamo mechanism , is larger than the energy - containing scales of the fluid , the dynamo is called a large - scale dynamo .",
    "the most common examples of astrophysical magnetic fields , e.g. , galactic magnetic fields , solar magnetic fields and planetary magnetic fields are generated by a large - scale dynamo .",
    "almost all large - scale dynamo mechanisms demand that the fluid flow possesses helicity , i.e. , handedness .",
    "the helicity of the flow is often described by the well - known @xmath4 effect which was proposed by parker @xcite with a detailed mathematical basis provided by steenbeck , krause and rdler  @xcite .",
    "the helical flow typically generates a helical field .",
    "thus almost all large - scale astrophysical magnetic fields are helical in nature .",
    "this is also true of large - scale magnetic fields generated by numerical simulations @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "observations of solar flares also show the helical nature of magnetic field ejected from the sun @xcite .",
    "the helical nature of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind has also been observed @xcite .",
    "one of the simple examples of a helical field , which is also a force - free field , is the arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) flow .",
    "the streamlines of the abc flows are chaotic  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the possibility of energization of a test - particle in a magnetic field , which is time - dependent abc function : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an abc function with wavenumber @xmath7 : @xmath8 here we choose @xmath0 ( which is the case where the abc flow has chaotic streamlines ) ; where the time - dependent part is a sine function with circular frequency @xmath9 and @xmath10 is time .",
    "although there could be time variations with multiple time scale are expected to occur in a realistic astrophysical environment , in this work we have chosen , as an example , a simple sinusoidal time variation of the helical field .",
    "furthermore , the energization of test - particles has been observed in complex ( in space , but constant in time ) turbulent electric fields generated by time variation of fluctuating magnetic field in direct numerical simulations of mhd  @xcite .",
    "it then behooves us to ask the question , what are the essential ingredients of the energization process ?",
    "can a simple magnetic field like an abc field that is periodic in both space and time , but is nevertheless expected to give rise to chaotic motion of test - particles , energize test - particles indefinitely ? finally , the abc field is an eigenfunction of the curl operator hence it is easy to solve maxwell s equations to obtain the electric field generated by the time - dependent part of the abc field .    through maxwell s equations ,",
    "the time - varying abc field shall generate a fluctuating electric field , given by @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the electric field , which is given by @xmath13 in addition , we assume that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the speed of light . hence we can safely ignore the displacement current in maxwell s equations of electrodynamics .",
    "we further assume the particle to be non - relativistic hence its equations of motion are given by newton s second law of motion @xmath16 here and henceforth , the dot denotes a time derivative . in what follows ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , length scales are normalized by @xmath17 , time by @xmath18 where @xmath18 is defined to be the characteristic gyro - frequency , @xmath19 we solve for @xmath20 copies of this six dimensional dynamical system .",
    "initially , the particle positions are uniformly distributed inside a cube of dimensions @xmath21 with velocity along the @xmath1-axis uniformly distributed between @xmath22 to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we use a fourth order runge - kutta method with fixed step size @xcite as our time - stepping algorithm .",
    "this algorithm is not energy - conserving by construction .",
    "however we have checked that , in practice , energy conservation is satisfied with a high degree of accuracy .. ] we have also checked for representative runs that a runge - kutta - fehlberg  @xcite scheme with variable step - size gives the same results . the computation",
    "are done with a python package to solve ordinary differential equations , and the figures are prepared using matplotlib  @xcite .",
    "let us first study the properties of trajectories of particles for the case in which the magnetic field is constant in time .",
    "in this case we define the characteristic gyroradius of the particle , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnitude of the velocity of the particle , and @xmath18 the characteristic gyro - frequency , is constant in time , because the energy of the particle is conserved .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath27 with @xmath7 being the characteristic wavenumber of the magnetic field . in this case , for times @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , the particles move in a field that is almost a constant and hence its motion is not random . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the time it takes a typical particle to go a distance equal to the wavelength of the magnetic field .",
    "the net displacement of the particle is due to the component of its velocity parallel to the local magnetic field .",
    "this component of velocity is also constant .",
    "hence , the mean - square displacement of the particles obeys @xmath31 in the other limit , @xmath32 , the particles encounter significant change in the magnetic field even within one gyro - orbit .",
    "hence , we expect non - trivial behavior in this regime . the mean - square displacement ( normalized by @xmath33 ) as a function of time ( normalized by @xmath18 ) , in log - log scale , is plotted in fig .",

    "we limit ourselves to the case where @xmath44 is very small and @xmath45 remains equal to unity .",

    "the growth at these short times can be understood by reminding ourselves that for @xmath52 , a particle does not encounter significant spatial change in the magnetic field . as @xmath44 is small",

    "the chaotic nature of particle trajectories plays a crucial role in our model . if we change the abc field such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 then we know that the magnetic lines of force are integrable and non - chaotic .",

    "fermi s theory also reproduces the experimental observation that the pdf of energies of cosmic rays has an inverse power - law tail .",
    "but diffusive shock acceleration of electrons can occur only if the initial energy of the electrons is at least of the order of a few mev which is significantly higher than the thermal energies ; this is the well - known _ injection problem_.    the mechanism we propose is akin to second order fermi acceleration where a charged particle is energized due to collisions with random scatter centers moving with random velocities .",
    "the input `` randomness '' is a crucial ingredient of this process and one typically obtains diffusive properties in both real and momentum space @xcite .",
    "the fermi second order process also produces a pdf of energies with power - law tail .",
    "by contrast , in our case the diffusive behavior is generated by deterministic chaos .",
    "we obtain sub - diffusive behavior ( @xmath75 ) in momentum space , which becomes close to diffusive behavior as @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the pdf of energies at large times becomes gaussian with steeper tails , i.e. , the pdf can be characterized as gaussian at low speed , but falls off more rapidly than a gaussian at speeds in excess of the mean . on the positive side ,",
    "our model is a possible mechanism that can generate a population of electron with super thermal energies .",
    "they can now act as a resolution to the injection problem .",
    "what is truly remarkable in our model is that a deceptively simple magnetic field with a dynamics that is smooth in time is able to energize particles to indefinitely high energies .",
    "the question of energization of a test ( charged ) particle in a turbulent plasma has been numerically studied in recent times , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "these studies consider energization in an electric field that is frozen - in - time but obtained from one snapshot of a direct numerical simulation of magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "in such a setup , test particles show diffusion in real space .",
    "energization is also observed , and at large time energy seems to grow linearly with time .",
    "in addition , the pdf of energies obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite has power - law tails .",
