    "several dynamic processes of physical @xcite , geologic @xcite , and technological @xcite interest involve superposed interacting rough surfaces able to display stick - slip motion @xcite . it has been discovered in the last few years that the intermittent sliding or stick - slip dynamics of a rough solid cylinder on a rough inclined surface submitted to small controlled perturbations is a fluctuation phenomenon characterized by non - trivial spatiotemporal scaling laws @xcite , and complex critical exponents @xcite if the inclination is below the angle of repose . in the usual stick - slip dynamics a solid is pulled at a constant driving velocity ; in the experiments discussed in this paper , on the other hand , the stick - slip dynamics appears as a consequence of a different mechanism : to start the slip we resort to small mechanical perturbations on an inclined surface below the angle of repose .",
    "a solid body on a perturbed incline is an example of a nonequilibrium system receiving an incoming energy flow . if energy is continuously injected into nonequilibrium systems , a complex sequential response characterized by time series of events of all sizes",
    "is often observed . besides sliding",
    "blocks on inclines , other important examples of systems and phenomena associated with a similar type of temporal response include piles of sand and other granular materials @xcite ; acoustic emission from volcanic rocks and microfracturing processes in general @xcite ; interface depinning in magnetic systems @xcite ; stick - slip motion in lubricated systems @xcite , and turbulence @xcite , among others .    in this paper ,",
    "the sliding susceptibility @xmath0 of a rough metallic cylinder of length @xmath1 placed on a rough inclined surface submitted to small controlled perturbations is introduced and examined . to obtain this response function",
    ", we performed a class of very time consuming experiments in which we count the number of perturbations on the incline that give origin to a certain number of sliding events of the cylinder .",
    "the total number of perturbations in our experiments exceeded @xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath3 sliding events .",
    "before and after each perturbation , the position of the cylinder along the incline as well as other variables of interest must be controlled .",
    "we find that @xmath0 presents scaling symmetry @xcite in a number of physical situations and the origin of this behavior is investigated .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows .",
    "the experimental details are described in sec . 2 ; and in sec .",
    "3 we report the experimental data , and discuss our principal results . also in sec .",
    "3 , we present scaling hypotheses to explain our findings . a summary of our major conclusions and future prospects are found in sec .",
    "the basic apparatus used to obtain the experimental data is outlined in fig . [",
    "fig : experiment ] : it consists of a rigid v - shaped anodized aluminum chute made of corner plate of @xmath4 mm of thickness and with @xmath5 angular aperture symmetrically disposed with respect to the vertical plane .",
    "the chute was rigidly maintained with an inclination @xmath6 with respect to the horizontal , and it is supplied with an articulated hammer of mass @xmath7 g or @xmath8 g which hits the base of the chute with a controlled ( fixed ) velocity close to @xmath9cm / s at the moment of the impact .",
    "the system is mounted on a 200 kg table isolated from mechanical vibrations .",
    "on the chute ( with an effective length @xmath10 mm ) is placed a metallic cylinder of length @xmath1 ( 5 mm to @xmath11 mm ) , and the system chute @xmath12 cylinder operates below the critical angle of repose @xmath13=@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the coefficient of static friction of the cylinder on the chute .",
    "two types of chute , hammer , and metallic cylinders were used as will be specified below . in the regime of inclination used in the experiments , the series of induced sliding events are intermittent , i.e. a fluctuating number of many controlled perturbations of the hammer is necessary to induce a single sliding event of the cylinder .",
    "each constant perturbation on the chute is associated with a time unit .",
    "the number of impacts of the hammer to obtain each sliding was recorded and from this data we performed the statistical analysis discussed in this paper . in all experiments",
    "the inclination was in the interval @xmath16 to @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , and the reduced angle @xmath19 was in the interval @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( see below for details ) .",
    "the sliding experiments were _ polarized _ in the sense that the cylinders were always placed on the chute in a same axial orientation .",
    "two types of experiments were made with the azimuthal orientation of the cylinder fixed or not . in the first case ,",
    "rotations of the cylinder around its symmetry axis are blocked , and as a consequence the interacting surfaces in contact were the same during all the experiment .",
    "the sliding spatial resolution is @xmath22 mm , and the angular resolution for the angle of inclination is @xmath23 . only sliding events with a length equal or larger than a threshold of @xmath24 mm",
    "are recorded for statistical purposes .",
    "the average sliding length in the experiments varies typically in the interval of @xmath25 to @xmath26 mm .",
    "the experiments were realized in a small sealed room at a temperature of @xmath27c , and @xmath28 of humidity .",
    "chute and cylinder operated free of lubrication and both surfaces were submitted to a periodic cleaning with ethanol and cotton wool .",
    "the experimental data obtained can be classified in four different groups , as follows .",
    "mm long groove ( the cross section is shown in b ) and is rigidly maintained at an inclination @xmath6 with the horizontal",
    ". the cylinders ( c ) have lengths varying from @xmath29 mm to @xmath30 mm .",

    ", a series of sliding events is planned to generate a total of 100 sliding events .",
    "both chute and cylinder have nominal deviations of the profile from a smooth surface in the range between about @xmath33 m and @xmath34 m @xcite .",
    "the mass of the hammer used to introduce the perturbations on the rigid v - shaped chute was @xmath35 g .",
    "the total duration of these time series varies from 364 ( for @xmath30 mm ) to @xmath36 ( for @xmath29 mm ) time units or hammer impacts . in this group",
    "the azimuthal orientation of the cylinder is held fixed .",
    "the _ average _ ( on the nine values of @xmath1 previously mentioned ) of the reduced angle of inclination in this group is @xmath37 .",
    "_ group g2 _ consists of 27 time series obtained with the same set of cylinders and chute of g1 ( here there are 3 independent time series associated with each one of the 9 values of @xmath1 ) , but the data were collected in 2002 , i.e. this group incorporates complex aging effects as for example the oxidation of the several interacting surfaces .",
    "two relevant aspects in this group are : ( i ) before the beginning of the experiments , the aluminum cylinders and the chute had to be cleaned firstly with a fine steel wool , and after with water and neutral soap .",
    "( ii ) the mass of the hammer used in the experiments in g2 was @xmath38 g .",
    "it is expected on the basis of these two modifications that the signal to noise ratio is somewhat inferior for g2 as compared with g1 .",
    "the effect of these modifications will be discussed in sec .",
    "3 . here , differently from g1 , both chute and cylinder have nominal deviations of the profile from a smooth surface in the range between about @xmath39 m and @xmath40 m @xcite after the use of the steel wool . in this group , the experiments maintained the same interface cylinder - chute by preventing azimuthal rotations of the cylinder around its longitudinal axis .",
    "the average of the reduced angle of inclination in this group is the same as in g1 : @xmath41 .",
    "_ group g3 _ refers to 17 time series of sliding events for the same cylinders and chute of g2 , but the length @xmath1 of the cylinders were restricted to the values @xmath1(mm ) @xmath42 100 , 200 , 300 , 500 , and 1000 . in the experiments grouped in g3 , the control to maintain the cylinders free of rotations around their longitudinal axes was relaxed ,",
    "i.e. in this case the cylinder - chute interface can vary continuously .",
    "especially the cylinders with the smaller lengths are more sensitive to execute small rotations around their longitudinal axes .",
    "the hammer used in g3 was the same used in g2 . in this group @xmath43 ( not an average )",
    "is fixed at @xmath21 .",
    "_ group g4 _ consists of 9 time series of sliding events obtained with a new set of aluminum cylinders and rigid aluminum chute ( also 1500 mm long ) , with the same type of surface finishing used to obtain the data in g1 . in this group",
    "we have used hollow cylinders of 10 mm external diameter and with 1 mm wall width .",
    "the cylinders are free to rotate around their symmetry axes as in g3 , and the hammer is the same used to obtain the data in g2 and g3 .",
    "the length of the cylinders used in this case and the associated number of equivalent time series were , respectively 1000mm / three series , 500mm / two series , 200mm / two series , and 100mm / two series . in this group @xmath43",
    "is fixed at @xmath44 for all the values of @xmath1 .    before to conclude this section , we would like to justify briefly the choice of some parameters in our experiments .",
    "six years after the acquisition of the data grouped in g1 , we decided to test the robustness of this type of sliding experiment .",
    "as a consequence , the experiment with g2 was planned to include more time series : performing three experiments for each value of the length @xmath1 was considered a compromise between reliability and limitation of time .",
    "after a long period to obtain the data grouped in g2 we were forced to restrict the variability of the length of the cylinders for g3 and g4 ( from 9 values of @xmath1 in g1 and g2 to 5 values of @xmath1 in g3 , and 4 values in g4 ) while maintaining the approximate number of time series ( 2 - 3 ) for each value of length .",
    "this decision was taken to avoid a pronounced abrasion of the chute . to compensate this limitation",
    ", we increased our control on the reduced angle of inclination .",
    "we have measured in the experiments the number of impacts of the hammer , @xmath45 , necessary to obtain @xmath46 sliding events with size @xmath47 mm , for a cylinder with length @xmath1 . to quantify the propensity or susceptibility of the cylinder to slide on the chute we introduce the sliding susceptibility @xmath48 defined as the ratio of the number of sliding events or failures to stick , @xmath46",
    ", to the corresponding number of trials to move the cylinder through the controlled perturbations on the chute , @xmath45 , that is @xmath49 thus , eq . ( 1 ) is an _ average _ quantity given by the reciprocal of the number of perturbations necessary to obtain one sliding event .",
    "if a large number of perturbations is necessary to obtain only a small number of sliding events , the corresponding susceptibility will be small ; on the contrary , if each perturbation of the hammer is followed by a sliding event , the susceptibility reaches its maximum value @xmath50 .",

    "our overall estimate is that the exponent @xmath60 in this type of experiment can assume values in the interval @xmath95 to @xmath96 , irrespective the group of data considered .",

    "an important observation on eq .",
    "( 3 ) is that it is expected to be true only for simple boundary conditions , for instance , for a rod with fixed extremities or a rod with free extremities on a perfectly smooth non - interacting plane .",
    "it is natural to consider how the number of modes are modified by the roughness that is present in most real surfaces . for a rough cylinder of length @xmath1 interacting with a rough fractal plane , @xmath85 can scale as @xmath99 , where @xmath60 is a non - trivial exponent smaller than the unit",

    "it is interesting to notice that this behavior is reminiscent from the observed dependence of the average interval between earthquakes @xmath102 on a fault with length @xmath1 : @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "thus the interval between earthquakes on a specified fault is longer for smaller faults , and decays as a power - law , as similarly observed in our experiments for sliding events of rough solid cylinders on rough inclines .",
    "now we will introduce in the discussion what seems to be the second physical aspect to be considered to explain the experimental results reported in this work : the effect of the roughness of the cylinder - chute interacting surfaces .",

    "[ fig : t_n(l)_g1 ] to [ fig : t_n(l)_g4 ] is connected with the frequently observed fractal _",
    "nonstationary _ behavior of the roughness of surfaces @xcite ; by this we understand that a sample of finite length @xmath1 taken from a real surface will never , however long , completely represents its properties .",
    "if the height @xmath104 of a surface as a function of the position along a particular cut , @xmath105 , is measured , the associated roughness can be defined by the width @xmath106 , where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . a great deal of experimental data @xcite corroborate a robust scaling relation for @xmath109 along an impressive interval of variability of _ eight _ decades in @xmath1 , from typically @xmath110 m to @xmath111 m : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the so called roughness exponent , and @xmath114 is the surface fractal dimension in physical space @xcite .",

    "why indeed should the sliding susceptibility be proportional to the roughness of the surface ?",
    "there are in principle three arguments in favor of the conjecture given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) :    first of all , the susceptibility is according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) an average on fluctuating sliding events .",
    "these fluctuations reflect obviously the fluctuating forces on the cylinders , which are in turn contact forces operating in the fractal nonstationary interface cylinder - chute .",
    "we should expect that these contact forces are affected by basic geometric aspects of the surfaces , and in particular by the surface roughness .",
    "secondly , eq . ( 5 ) reduces to the correct limit @xmath125 , for a perfect surface ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "this is expected because in this case the chute - cylinder interacting surfaces are firmly welded in a single structure due to strong atomic interactions .",
    "thirdly , if we consider what is said in the previous paragraph , and apply eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for earthquakes , we obtain @xmath127 if we use the reported value @xmath128 for the fractal dimension of fault surfaces @xcite .",
    "the last scaling is equivalent to say that the predicted average time between earthquakes on a fault with length @xmath1 would scale as @xmath129 , which is close to the reported value @xmath103 , obtained from seismic data @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we use consistently eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , we obtain that the number of vibration modes accessible to the cylinder on the chute scales as @xmath130 a result that reduces indeed to eq .",
    "( 3 ) only in the euclidean limit @xmath131 . in principle",
    ", we expect in conformity with eq .",
    "( 6 ) , that cylinder and chute rough surfaces with increasing values of @xmath114 tend to be more tightly engaged as a consequence of the increment in the effective area for microscopic interactions . this effect materializes itself in a microscopic reduction in the number of allowed vibration modes of the cylinder , i.e. @xmath85 scales with @xmath1 with an exponent necessarily smaller than the unit . in particular , a reduction in the number of allowed vibration modes is expected to be maximum if the interacting rough surfaces are space - filling surfaces with surface fractal dimension @xmath132 . in this case , the surface interactions are saturated in the sense that they behave as volume - interactions that constrain the number of vibration modes to assume small values that are essentially independent of @xmath1 ( or perharps have a logarithmic dependence on the length of the cylinder ) . for brownian surfaces ( @xmath133 ) , we obtain the result @xmath134 , which seems to describe the body of our experimental data .",
    "we have introduced a statistical response function @xmath97 that measures the degree of propensity of a rough cylinder to slide on a perturbed rough surface inclined below the angle of repose .",
    "this function was investigated from the experimental point of view and we have found that @xmath97 increases with the length of the cylinder as a nontrivial power - law in a number of situations . a possible origin for this scaling behavior is discussed in terms of a connection with the number of vibration modes of a rough cylinder on a rough chute , as well as in terms of the statistics of the roughness of the interacting surfaces .",
    "it is natural to ask on the influence of the several parameters appearing in the experiments on the exponent @xmath60 .",
    "although a final answer to this subject can not be advanced at the present stage , some considerations can be outlined : ( i ) in the light of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , the reduction observed from @xmath135 to @xmath70 could be attributed to an effective increase in the surface fractal dimension of the cylinders after the use of the steel wool as described in sec .",
    "( ii ) the increase observed from @xmath70 to @xmath77 could be associated to the corresponding increase in the reduced angle of inclination from @xmath136 to @xmath137 . it can be noticed that the largest exponent ( @xmath138 ) is obtained in the experiment with the largest @xmath43 .",
    "( iii ) the proximity between @xmath139 ( massive cylinder ) and @xmath140 ( hollow cylinder ) , both with almost the same @xmath43 , could suggest that the response of hollow cylinders perturbed by a light hammer is equivalent to that of massive cylinders perturbed by a heavy hammer .",
    "however , due to the very time consuming nature of the experiments described in this paper , a number of experimental aspects remain to be systematically investigated in the future .",
    "thus , new experiments exploring the variation of the intensity of the perturbation on the chute and the variation of the materials involved , as well as the effect of the diameter of the cylinders are necessary to clarify this fluctuation phenomenon associated with the stick - slip dynamics .",
    "furthermore , other important aspects to be answered are the type of variation of @xmath97 with the reduced angle @xmath141 , for @xmath1 fixed ; and the possibility of a universal value @xmath142 for the susceptibility exponent in any experiment involving sliding of rough solids of the type discussed in this paper .",
