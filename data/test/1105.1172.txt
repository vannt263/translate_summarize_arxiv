    "the mass is equal to @xmath15 and the effective newton s constant is @xmath16 .",

    "we then compute the total energy , entropy , temperature and discuss the thermodynamical properties .",
    "we shall see that phase transitions exist when @xmath21 , which is allowed by unitarity / stability .",
    "soon after the action ( [ i ] ) was proposed , solutions with spherical symmetry of the form @xmath22 were discovered by isham and storey does not introduce conical singularities because these solutions are asymptotically ( a)ds , and have horizons .",
    "we thank r. mann for a useful conversation on this point . ]",
    "@xcite . for our purposes here is enough to mention that @xmath23 and @xmath24 have the schwarzschild - ads form @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 are independent integration constants and @xmath28 .",
    "the cosmological constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath27 .",
    "see @xcite for full details .",
    "a remarkable property of the solution , already noticed in @xcite , is that @xmath1 can also be brought to a schwarzschild form via a coordinate change @xmath31 , with a suitable @xmath32 . in the new coordinate system",
    "the metric @xmath1 takes the form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "the zero s of @xmath24 then represent horizons for the metric @xmath1 .",
    "the full solution is then simply two schwarzschild metrics written in different coordinate system .",
    "the isham - storey solution fulfills another remarkable property .",
    "consider an arbitrary linear combination of both metrics @xmath35 since @xmath1 is off - diagonal , the metric @xmath36 is also off - diagonal .",
    "one can introduce a new time coordinate @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 , and again , for a suitable choice of @xmath39 the metric @xmath36 becomes diagonal .",
    "the remarkable property is that for _ any _ choice of @xmath40 this metric again has the schwarzschild form @xmath41 where @xmath42 are constants that depend on @xmath42 , and @xmath43 depend on all parameters @xmath44 .",
    "this metric represents a black hole with a new mass parameters that depends on the particular linear combination .",
    "in particular , the location of the horizon depends on @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for fixed values of @xmath45 , the isham - storey solution generates a whole family of black holes with horizons at arbitrary locations .    summarizing , at first sight , the isham - storey configuration has ( at least ) two horizons -one for each metric- defined by the points where the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 vanish .",
    "these ( candidate ) horizons are located at different and independent points in spacetime because the zeroes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined by independent integrations constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this interpretation is however not correct .",
    "the isham - storey configuration is singular because , as we now show , there is no coordinate system where both horizons can be made regular simultaneously .    as a first attempt to prove regularity ,",
    "the metric @xmath0 can be put in eddington - flinkestein coordinates @xcite making it regular at its own horizon .",
    "remarkably , the metric @xmath1 becomes regular at that point as well .",
    "however , this can only be achieved for either ingoing or outgoing coordinates ( depending on the choice of sign for @xmath48 ) , but not for both simultaneously . as it is well - known @xcite",
    ", only half of the eddington - flinkestein coordinates is not enough to declare regularity .",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath0 horizon defined by the condition @xmath49 if @xmath50 this equation has more than one positive solution .",
    "the argument that follows applies to all regular horizons .",
    "we assume , however , that the horizon is non - extremal , that is @xmath51 .",
    "the argument can be generalized to extreme horizons as well . defining a proper radial coordinate @xmath52 in a neighborhood of the horizon",
    ", the metric @xmath0 can be brought to the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant .",
    "the 1-form @xmath55 is singular at the horizon ( now located at @xmath56 ) but @xmath57 is regular .",
    "the metric ( [ a ] ) represents a regular spacetime written in singular hyperbolic polar coordinates .",
    "let us now look at the metric @xmath1 in the neighborhood of @xmath58 .",
    "the functions @xmath59 take finite values at that point and thus , naively , the metric @xmath1 looks regular , @xmath60 here @xmath61 and @xmath62 are non - zero for generic values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then , since the 1-form @xmath55 is singular at @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) , the metric ( [ fhor ] ) is actually singular there . a more geometrical way to see",
    "this is to note that the set of points @xmath65 with fixed angular variables correspond to a timelike one - dimensional curve in the metric @xmath1 , but a 0-dimensional point in the metric @xmath0 .",
    "this means that metric @xmath0 requires that the above set of points should be identified , while metric @xmath1 require them to be all independent .",
    "the only way to make this metric regular is to assume that @xmath24 and @xmath48 also vanish at @xmath63 ( with appropriate weights ) . a more explicit way to reach to the same conclusion",
    "is to put the metric ( [ a ] ) in regular cartesian coordinates .",
    "this can always be done in a neighborhood of its horizon .",
    "then one looks at the metric @xmath1 in this ( regular ) coordinate system .",
    "it follows that @xmath1 can be regular at the horizon of @xmath0 if and only if its own horizon is also located there .    in summary ,",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath66 denote , respectively , the solutions to @xmath67 and @xmath68 we have concluded that @xmath0 is singular at @xmath66 , and @xmath1 is singular at @xmath69 .",
    "the only truly regular solution is one with @xmath70 .",
    "this solution does exist , but corresponds to a proportional case @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is a constant ) , where @xmath0 is the schwarzschild metric .",
    "this particular solution is the only regular black hole within the family of isham - storey solutions .",
    "it is instructive to recall the reissner - nordstrom black hole system having a non - zero coulomb field @xmath73 .",
    "the same arguments exhibited above imply that the potential @xmath74 must be zero at the horizon if one demands the 1-form @xmath75 to be regular there .",
    "for the reissner - nordstrom black hole , this can always be achieved via a suitable gauge transformation .    the isham - storey exact solution associated to the potential ( [ u1 ] )",
    "can not be interpreted as a black hole , but only as the exterior solution to some mass distribution in bigravity .",
    "we were motivated by the question of whether or not the singularity at the horizon was a generic property of bigravity , or a property of the particular isham - salam - strathdee potential ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "the potential ( [ u1 ] ) is one member within the infinite dimensional family of potentials @xcite given rise to a unitary and stable linear pauli - fierz theory .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether or not other potentials may give rise to regular black holes . to answer this question ( in a simple way without trying to prove a general theorem )",
    "we shall consider the 2-parameter family of potentials , @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for all @xmath77 , this potential belongs to the pauli - fierz class as defined in @xcite , and that for @xmath78 we recover the potential ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "see @xcite for a much larger class of potentials admitting exact solutions .",
    "we shall see that , for generic values of @xmath77 , regular , non - trivial ( i.e. , non - proportional ) black hole solutions do exist . since the condition @xmath79 represents an open set one can conjecture that , generically , the pauli - fierz family of potentials does accept regular black holes solutions .    before displaying the exact solution to the potential ( [ u2 ] ) we mention that ( i ) the potential ( [ u2 ] ) also accepts the background @xmath80 .",
    "the linear spectrum contains a massless field plus a pauli - fierz massive theory .",
    "the mass is now , @xmath81 as in the previous case , @xmath82 must be positive to avoid ghosts .",
    "then , linear unitarity / stability holds for @xmath83    our goal is to prove that a regular solutions exist , not to classify all solutions , which is a hard task .",
    "we consider the family of potentials where @xmath10 is positive while @xmath77 is negative .",
    "we write them in the form , @xmath84    the metric components are more complicated albeit exact @xcite . the metric ansatz is again given by ( [ ans ] ) , and the functions @xmath85 are now given by the following expressions , @xmath86 the exponent @xmath87 and the cosmological constants are given by @xmath88 here @xmath89 is a new constant defined by @xmath90 unlike the isham - storey solution , now the parameter @xmath91 entering in the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) is an arbitrary constant .",
    "note that this solution describes ( anti)-de sitter solutions even though there is no cosmological constant in the action .",
    "the main difference with respect to the isham - storey solution is the new term @xmath92 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these terms are generic and appear for a large class of potentials .    given the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 above , the function @xmath93 is most easily expressed as the solution to the following simple relation @xmath94 finally , knowing @xmath24 and @xmath93 , the function @xmath48 is given by @xmath95 these relations fix completely all unknown functions .",
    "we then have an exact solution to the equations of motion following from the action ( [ i ] ) with the potential ( [ u2 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the isham - storey solution , the parameter @xmath96 entering in the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) is now an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "the range of this constant is severely restricted if we demand the charge @xmath97 to be localized . since @xmath97 enters in the metric in the form @xmath92 where @xmath87 is given in ( [ alpha ] ) . demanding @xmath87 to be positive requires",
    "@xmath98 a plot of @xmath99 is displayed in fig .",
    "( [ alpha.fig ] ) .    .",
    "in the range @xmath100 the exponent @xmath87 is always positive and greater than @xmath101.[alpha.fig ] ]    the cosmological constants appearing in our exact solution are not fundamental constants but depend on the state ( see ( [ alpha ] ) ) .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ cosm ] the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the allowed range of @xmath91 given in ( [ k0 ] ) .",
    "we see that de sitter and anti - de sitter phase may coexist .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a variational formulation on de sitter spaces .",
    "note that for @xmath102 , which will turn out to be the most interesting case , both cosmological constants are negative for most values of @xmath96 , with a small de sitter window .     and @xmath103 .",
    "left panel @xmath104 ; right panel @xmath102 .",
    "[ cosm ] ]    the main property of this solution is the appearance of 4 integration constants @xmath105 and @xmath91 .",
    "one would like to give an interpretation to these constants in terms of asymptotic conserved charges .",
    "this is however not possible .",
    "as has been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) , bigravity solutions break lorentz ( or de sitter ) invariance .",
    "in fact , in our case , the only asymptotic killing vector is constant time translations . in this sense",
    "there is only one conserved charge at infinity .",
    "interestingly , black holes do indeed have only one charge . as we see in next section regularity of the horizon",
    "imposes three restrictions on the values of @xmath106 . as a result",
    ", there is only one remaining free parameter that we can identify as the total energy ( conjugate to time translations ) .",
    "the horizon for the metric @xmath0 is given by the inner solution of the equation @xmath107 .",
    "( the outer solution , if any , will be a cosmological horizon ) .",
    "as before , the metric @xmath1 has its own horizon defined by the equation @xmath108 . as discussed before ,",
    "the only way to have a regular horizon is to ensure that both @xmath24 and @xmath23 vanish at the same point .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath48 -which appears in the metric multiplied by the singular 1-form @xmath55- has to vanish at the horizon as well .",
    "there is one more restriction to achieve regularity .",
    "the  temperatures \" of both metrics must be the same .",
    "this is a condition in either the minkowskian or euclidean sectors .",
    "kruskal coordinates will exists simultaneously for both metrics provided the derivatives @xmath109 and @xmath110 evaluated at @xmath63 are correlated .",
    "this is most easily seen in the euclidean sector as a condition eliminating a conical singularity .",
    "but it is equally valid in the minkowskian sector as a condition for the kruskal extension to exist .    summarizing ,",
    "let @xmath69 the zero of @xmath23 , @xmath111 recall that @xmath23 is given in ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "this equation merely defines @xmath58 without really imposing any restriction .",
    "now , we demand the horizon of the @xmath1 metric to be located at the same spacetime point , that is @xmath112 next , as discussed above , we also demand the function @xmath48 to vanish at this point @xmath113 finally , the temperatures of both horizons must be the same so that a kruskal extension exists for both simultaneously .",
    "this condition reads @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a complicated constant that we prefer to omit .",
    "ideally , one would like to use ( [ h],[x],[h],[t ] ) to express , for example , @xmath106 in terms of @xmath58 .",
    "this is algebraically impossible .",
    "what we can do , it to use these equations to write @xmath105 as functions of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , a regular black hole is built by choosing a value of @xmath96 , within the allowed range ( [ k0 ] ) .",
    "once @xmath96 is given , all other charges @xmath116 take definite values .",
    "the explicit formulas are analytical but not very illuminating so we skip them .",
    "it is more illustrative to present plots of @xmath117 for the allowed range of @xmath91 .",
    "( [ sigmapos.fig ] ) shows @xmath105 for @xmath6 positive and fig .",
    "( [ sigmaneg.fig ] ) shows @xmath105 for @xmath6 negative .",
    "these pictures are generic and do not change drastically for small variations of the parameters within the allowed ranges .",
    "@xmath118 , @xmath119 ]     @xmath118 , @xmath120 ]       one may be concerned that imposing all these conditions require severe fine tuning and the solution is highly non - generic .",
    "note , however , that this fine tuning must not be imposed .",
    "the parameters @xmath121 of the solutions are not conserved quantities . only one particular combination of them , the total energy , which will be discussed in the next section , is conserved during gravitational collapse .",
    "the particular way the collapse takes place will not be considered here , but it is a sensible guess , that in order to satisfy the cosmic censorship conjecture , the parameters will evolve to an equilibrium value that fulfill the constraint . from the canonical point of view",
    "we expect that this may also be derived from an extremum principle , in the same way that the constraint relating energy and temperature may be derived in the euclidean treatment of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "we leave this to future work .",
    "we now turn to the problem of computing the mass , and thermodynamical functions for this black hole .    ideally , we should set up boundary conditions appropriated to the black hole problem , preserving some asymptotic group .",
    "however , bigravity solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti-)de sitter . for the black holes displayed above , each metric is asymptotically ( anti- ) de sitter but with different speeds of light .",
    "there is no obvious asymptotic structure one would like to preserve . in order to move forward",
    "we do the calculation in the quickest way by allowing in the variational principle at least the family of metrics described by eh black hole , varying all parameters .",
    "since the potential in the action has no derivatives of the fields , it does not contribute to the boundary terms .",
    "the total energy is clearly given by two adm functionals , one for each metric . by usual methods @xcite",
    ", we find for the variation of the hamiltonian , @xmath122 plus terms that vanish on - shell .",
    "as explained above , the second line follows by plugging the black hole solution in the variation of the boundary term , varying all parameters .",
    "@xmath123 is a expected contribution from @xmath124 while the second term comes from @xmath125 .",
    "it is very interesting to observe that both @xmath126 and @xmath127 have divergent contributions ( as @xmath128 ) .",
    "these are expected because the metrics have terms of the form @xmath129 where @xmath29 is not a fundamental constant .",
    "instead , @xmath29 depends on integration constants ( see ( [ alpha ] ) ) which are varied in the action principle .",
    "however , these divergent pieces nicely cancel each other and the sum @xmath130 remains finite .",
    "a phenomenon like this one has been observed in other systems @xcite .",
    "a general argument has been given in @xcite .",
    "note that the second term depends on @xmath47 and @xmath91 .",
    "one may conclude that this solution has a new asymptotic symplectic pair @xmath131 ( a charge with a corresponding chemical potential ) .",
    "this interpretation is however not correct .",
    "there is only one asymptotic time translation symmetry and only the total energy is a conserved charge .",
    "integrability of the total energy then implies that @xmath47 can not be varied arbitrarily , but must be a function of @xmath91 .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath47 is related to @xmath96 for regular black holes .",
    "we use this relation and write the total energy as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is plotted in figs .",
    "[ sigmapos.fig ] and [ sigmaneg.fig ] as function of @xmath91 .",
    "we have arbitrarily chosen @xmath134 as a reference state .",
    "this is an allowed value and corresponds to the point where the exponent @xmath99 takes its minimum value @xmath135 .",
    "the temperature of the black hole can be computed either from the @xmath0 or @xmath1 black hole . applying the usual formula for the @xmath0 black hole , @xmath136    in fig .",
    "[ beta ] we plot the temperature for two choices of parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    ". focus first on the left panel with @xmath139 .",
    "we see that for a given value of @xmath140 ( not too large ) there exists two values of @xmath91 , and hence two values of @xmath105 . in the canonical ensemble , where @xmath140 is fixed ,",
    "there exists two black holes consistent with that temperature . to discern which one is realized one needs to compute the free energy . for negative values of @xmath6",
    "the situation is even more interesting . on the right panel",
    "we plot @xmath141 for @xmath142 . for a given value of @xmath140",
    "there are up to 4 values of @xmath91 and thus 4 states .",
    "again , to discern which one is the most stable one we need to compute the free energy . the free energy will also tell us whether or not phase transitions among these states can occur or not .",

    "in this case , there are two states ( two values of @xmath91 ) for each temperature .",

    "here there are up to four states for each temperature .",
    "this indicates possible phase transitions .",
    "the temperature @xmath143 diverges near the extreme allowed values @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the horizon also vanishes at those points and the behavior resembles that of schwarzschild . ]",
    "as shown in fig . ( [ beta ] ) , for a given temperature there can be up to 4 values of @xmath91 .",
    "hence , for a given temperature there may be up to four different black hole metrics . to decide which is thermodynamically favored we need to compute the free energy @xmath146 .",
    "the logic here mimics step by step the usual gr calculation , although the details are more involved .",
    "the full hamiltonian action must be supplemented by two boundary terms at the horizon and infinity , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is given in ( [ e ] ) and ( @xmath149 ) @xmath150 this formula for the horizon boundary term follows from general grounds ( it can also be derived straightforwardly ) .",
    "indeed , the full action is a sum of einstein - hilbert actions .",
    "therefore , the total entropy is expected to be a sum of the individual bekenstein - hawking entropies .",
    "note that the second action is multiplied by @xmath6 , hence the second entropy is multiplied by @xmath6 .",
    "up to this point , the horizon @xmath58 has no logical relation with the asymptotic charges @xmath26 , etc . the action principle ( [ if ]",
    ") is appropriated to black hole fields having a horizon at some arbitrary point @xmath58 .",
    "the next step is to evaluate the action on a saddle - point approximation .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , we solve the constraints plugging the regular black hole solution .",
    "the bulk pieces vanish ( because there are a combination of constraints ) and the total action becomes @xmath151 where now the entropy does depend on the asymptotic charge .",
    "this is not the end yet .",
    "since @xmath148 is varied ( @xmath140 is fixed ) , there is one remaining equation @xmath152 which implies the first law : @xmath153 of course , one can check that this value for @xmath140 is consistent with the ` no - cone ' condition ( [ t ] ) .",
    "the free energy @xmath154 is a function of the temperature .",

    "this is true in the whole range of @xmath91 and hence there are no phase transitions in this case .     and @xmath161    a more interesting situation occurs for @xmath162 ( for @xmath102 , linear unitarity / stability requires @xmath163 ) .",

    "[ s-3 ] we plot the temperature and free energy for a sequence of values of @xmath138 , leaving @xmath118 fixed showing how the systems moves from two to four states . since @xmath138 is a coupling constant in the action we would not interpret this effect as a second order transition .     and @xmath177",
    "to conclude , we have argued that the isham - storey exact solution can not represent a black hole but the exterior solution to a spherical star .",
    "this is not a generic property of bigravity , but of the potential chosen by isham and storey . for more generic potentials",
    "we find more integration constants in the solutions , which may be fine tuned to produce a regular horizon .",
    "we have computed the total energy , temperature and free energy of these solutions and have found several phases in the canonical formalism .",
    "phase transitions do occur for certain critical values of the temperature , depending on the coupling @xmath6 and the potential parameters @xmath159 and @xmath138 .",
