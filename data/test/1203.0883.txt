    "duality between gravity and gauge theory in spacetime with different dimensionalities has been discovered by maldacena in 1998  @xcite .",
    "the type - iib string theory in ads@xmath0 is conjectured to be dual to a gauge theory in four dimensional minkowski spacetime ( @xmath1 ) at the boundary of the ads space .",
    "the correspondence can be used as a complementary method to study the strongly coupled gauge theory in four dimensional minkowski spacetime , a cousin of quantum chromodynamics , by avoiding the uncontrollable non - perturbative calculation via the application of weak - strong duality .",
    "we can deal with this problem by alternatively performing calculations in the tractable weakly interacting string theory in five  ( plus five compact dimensions which provide details that are not relevant here ) dimensional anti de sitter space ( ads@xmath2 ) .",
    "the duality is extended to a finite temperature situation by adding a horizon in the radial coordinate  @xcite . the string theory in an ads space with black hole horizon in the radial direction is proposed to be dual to a gauge theory at finite temperature .",
    "the duality is made quantitative in the sense that the hawking temperature in the bulk theory corresponds to the temperature of the gauge theory on the boundary .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence provides the first string - theoretic example of the underlying generic principle of the holographic duality  ( i.e. the holographic principle ) .",
    "the idea of holographic duality was originally proposed by t hooft  @xcite in a generic quantum gravity situation involving a gravitational horizon .",
    "the precise string theoretic version was given by susskind  @xcite .",
    "when an object falls into a black hole , it will be stretched , torn apart into bits and eventually the bits will be smeared out over the horizon .",
    "consequently , all of the bulk information is spread over the horizonal surface resulting in an effective boundary description of the bulk theory .",
    "the bulk world is holographically encoded on the boundary .",
    "connection between ads space and holography was further clarified by witten  @xcite after discovery of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "given an ads space , the weakly - coupled bulk gravity theory corresponds to a strongly - coupled boundary gauge theory . adding a black hole to the ads space , the dual gauge theory on the boundary becomes thermal with the temperature equal to the corresponding hawking - page temperature of the background  @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate the intermediate situation where there exists a massive object before gravitational collapse into a black hole in the ads space and search for the dual description in the gauge theory side .",
    "it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the degenerate fermions in the ads correspond to the composite multitrace operator constructed from product of single trace operators in the large central charge limit on the boundary .",
    "it is not unreasonable to think of this  free \" fermionic operator as the conformal cousin of a qcd nucleon such as neutron and proton .",
    "these  free fermions \" , however , still interact with each other by the colour - singlet interaction of order @xmath3 assuming negligible in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "the colour - singlet  ( glueball ) exchange on the boundary corresponds holographically to the gravitational interaction in the bulk .",
    "while gravity pulls the bulk mass together causing the gravitational collapse , the colour - singlet interaction should be responsible for the deconfinement phase transition of the injected mass in the dual picture .",
    "arguably , the gravitational collapse of the star in the ads would correspond to a thermalization process of the dual gauge matter on the boundary  @xcite .",
    "consideration of the mass limit of the fermionic star in the ads bulk could reveal certain details of the pre - thermalization process in the dual gauge picture .",
    "the mass limit of the ads star corresponds to the minimum amount of injected mass required in order for the boundary gauge matter to start the thermalization process  ( since the bulk gravitational collapse starts when injected mass exceeds the mass limit ) .",
    "specifically , it is also interesting to ask what the dual object of the bulk temperature is on the boundary world before black hole formation ?",
    "should it correspond to some parameter characterizing the superheated phase of gauge matter before the start of the thermalization ?",
    "moreover , what is the exact nature of the colour - singlet  ( glueball exchange ) interaction responsible for the deconfinement of the dual gauge matter into the thermalized deconfined plasma  ( which is the dual picture of the gravitational collapse caused by gravity ) ?",
    "the heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic and cern s lhc  ( large hadron collider ) smash two charged ions at extreme energies , producing dense and hot nuclear matter with properties of the strongly coupled plasma . in the vicinity of the collision point , the induced magnetic field could be enormous  @xcite .",
    "understanding the physics of dense hot nuclear plasma under such circumstances requires nonperturbative treatments of the strong interaction and the holographic method is one option .",
    "one holographic dual of the magnetized nuclear matter at finite temperature is proposed to be a magnetized black brane in the ads space  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the entropy density of the magnetized brane in the ads obeys the third law of thermodynamics with entropy @xmath5  ( temperature ) for small temperature .    in this article",
    ", we consider a fermionic star in the holographic ads@xmath2 background in the presence of external magnetic field at finite bulk temperature . the mass limit and other properties of the star",
    "is studied with respect to the changes in the magnetic field and bulk temperature .",
    "even though there is no complete understanding of the dual description in the gauge theory side of this situation , we argue certain aspects of the duality . in section",
    "ii , the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff  ( tov ) equation  @xcite in the background ads@xmath2 is calculated starting from the general dimensionality",
    ". the energy levels of the bulk charged fermions in the presence of the magnetic field are calculated in the flat space approximation .",

    "section vi investigates the dependence of mass limit on the ads radius . section vii contains further discussions and summary of our results",
    "the study of the magnetized star in the ads space consists of two main calculations .",
    "first , the pressure and energy density need to be calculated for the system of charged fermions in the magnetic field at arbitrary temperature .",
    "the star will be assumed electrically neutral and we will focus only on the effect of magnetic field to the charged particles . at zero temperature , the energy states of the charged fermions in the magnetic field are separated naturally into landau levels . the partition function in the macrocanonical ensemble of these energy levels will provide the generic expression for the pressure and energy density of the fermionic system at finite temperature .",
    "the pressure and energy density are subsequently used in the equation of state required by the tov equation in the 5-dimensional ads spacetime . even though we will focus on interpreting the results of the bulk ads star in terms of the dual gauge theory , the calculations in the bulk picture are self - consistent and",
    "satisfactorily describe a real magnetized fermionic star in the 5-dimensional ads spacetime .      in order to study the behaviour of a degenerate star in @xmath6-dimensional ads spacetime",
    ", we derive the spherical symmetric tov equation in @xmath6 dimensions as given in appendix  [ appa ] . in the presence of external magnetic field ,",
    "the pressure of the fermionic matter in the star is actually anisotropic due to the quantization of the energy levels .",
    "however , in the classical limit where the momentum in the direction of the magnetic field is much larger than the square root of the magnetic field , @xmath7 , the pressure becomes isotropic  @xcite and the spherical symmetric tov equation is applicable .",

    "standard evaluation of the partition function requires the layout of energy states of the fermionic system which can be obtained in the following subsection .",
    "we now solve the dirac equation to find the relativistic energy level of a charged fermion in the presence of external magnetic field in the 5 dimensional spacetime . as an approximation",
    ", we will ignore the effect of curvature on the energy levels of the fermions .",

    "the energy condition from the equation of motion is given by @xmath33 if we let @xmath34 , then we have    @xmath35    from equation ( [ landau energy level 1 ] ) and ( [ landau energy level 2 ] ) , energy is quantized in the @xmath36 plane and contains certain degeneracy of states , _",
