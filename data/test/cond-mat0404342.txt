    "transported substance in subdiffusive systems one uses the subdiffusion equation with fractional time derivative @xcite @xmath6 with the riemann - liouville fractional derivative defined as ( for @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the smallest integer larger than @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the subdiffusion coefficient measured in the units @xmath12 . while there is a huge literature about the normal diffusion in a variety of systems",
    "( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the subdiffusion is satisfactorily described in a few cases only .",
    "the procedure of solving the equation ( [ se ] ) appears to be rather complicated .",
    "below we present a practical method to calculate the solutions of the equations describing in a multi - part system where diffusion and subdiffusion occur .",
    "the starting point is the solution corresponding to the analogous multi - part system where only normal diffusion is present .    till now homogeneous systems have been mostly studied .",
    "however , the multi - part systems discussed here , in particular the membrane systems , are important for several fields of technology and biophysics .",
    "we mention here as examples the membranes used as micro filters and the ( sub-)diffusion processes in living cells which are crucial for the cell physiology .",
    "there are a few attempts described in the literature to obtain solutions of eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) from the ones corresponding to the normal diffusion .",
    "a powerful method seems to be mapping of the solutions of diffusion equation @xmath13 into the subdiffusive ones @xmath14 by means of the relation @xcite @xmath15 where the laplace transform of the function @xmath9 is @xmath16 ( throughout this paper the index @xmath10 is assigned to the functions corresponding to subdiffusion ; the index @xmath17 refers to the normal diffusion ) .",
    "another method is to ` rescale ' the time as @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "using the substitution one obtains the solutions of normal diffusion equation with diffusion coefficient depending on time .",
    "however , both procedures have been used to the homogeneous system only and it is unclear how to apply these approaches to a multi - part system , where the various kinds of diffusion occur ( e.g. a porous material , where subdiffusion proceeds , is adjoined to a normal diffusive medium ) .",
    "thus , a more general procedure is needed .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a method of constructing solutions of the one - dimensional subdiffusive equation with given boundary conditions starting with those of normal diffusion , which can be obtained rather easily .",
    "our method gives the green s functions ( gf ) for subdiffusive equation in the form of series of the fox functions which is convenient for numerical calculations .",
    "the method splits into two step . in the first one",
    "the laplace transform of the subdiffusive green s function is obtained from the normal diffusion counterpart , and in the second one the laplace transform is inverted .",
    "in contrast to the previous papers @xcite , we include boundary conditions into considerations . as an illustration of our method , we find the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) for the system consisting of two parts where the normal diffusion and subdiffusion occur , respectively .",
    "we restrict our considerations to the case of boundary conditions which are given in the form of linear combination of concentrations and fluxes .",
    "we note that this is not a serious restriction as the linear boundary conditions often occur in normal diffusion problems ( and can be adapted for the subdiffusion cases ) .",
    "for example , for the system with fully reflecting , fully absorbing @xcite , and partially absorbing wall @xcite , respectively , the boundary conditions read : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes a position of the wall . for the partially permeable wall there",
    "have been used two different boundary conditions : @xmath23 @xcite or @xmath24 @xcite , which both should be supplemented by the continuity of the flux @xmath25 .",
    "since the green s function for normal diffusion is mapped onto the subdiffusion within the method presented below , we first discuss the connection between the equation of normal diffusion and the subdiffusive equation .",
    "we start with the normal diffusion equation @xmath26 and assume that each of the boundary condition involves a linear combination of fluxes and concentrations . when the system under consideration is divided into two parts by the membrane located at @xmath27 , the boundary condition ( bc ) at @xmath22",
    "is assumed to be of the form @xmath28 where the flux @xmath29 is given as @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are the parameters independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ ne ] ) can be found due to the following integral formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the initial concentration , and the green s function @xmath35 is defined as a solution of the equation ( [ ne ] ) with the initial concentration @xmath36 with the appropriate boundary conditions . since the diffusion equation is of the second order with respect to the space variable one needs two boundary conditions at the discontinuity of the system . when the system is infinite , the additional bc are needed at @xmath37 and they are usually of the form @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which can be treated as special cases of eq .",

    "the boundary condition at @xmath27 is assumed to be of the form fully analogical to that of the normal diffusion ( [ bcn ] ) i.e. @xmath55 the laplace transform of the subdiffusion equation , subdiffusive flux @xcite and boundary conditions are , respectively , @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 the solution of eq .",

    "since the green s functions are uniquely determined by the subdiffusion equation , boundary conditions and initial condition ( which are assumed to be the same for normal diffusion and subdiffusion ) , it is clear that the substitution ( [ sb ] ) transforms the green s function for normal diffusion ( [ ltnfg ] ) into the green s function for subdiffusion ( [ ltsfg ] ) . comparing eq .",

    "otherwise , the additional restrictions should be imposed .",
    "for example , when @xmath83 , the equation ( [ p ] ) is still valid under the condition @xmath84 . in the following",
    "we consider the cases where @xmath85 , so we will not further discuss the domain of applicability of the formula ( [ p ] ) .",
    "to illustrate the considerations of the previous section , we find here the green s functions for the homogeneous system , which are well - known , and next we discuss a composite system containing two parts where , respectively , the normal diffusion and subdiffusion occur . as far as we know , such a system has not been considered yet . leaving the detailed analysis of this system to the next paper ,",
