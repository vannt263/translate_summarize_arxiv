    "the oort cloud @xcite remains the most mysterious part of our solar system , primarily because it can not be directly observed .",
    "our only observational clues to the size , shape , mass and composition of the oort cloud come from observations of long - period comets .",
    "the demographics of observed long - period comets have been the starting point of almost all attempts to model the oort cloud ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    until the last ten or so years",
    ", the vast majority of comets were discovered by systematic eyeball searches , using small telescopes @xcite .",
    "these surveys have been highly effective at identifying large samples of comets , and in deriving their orbital parameters .",
    "they do , however , have three major drawbacks :    * unknown selection function : it is very unclear how often different parts of the sky are surveyed , and to what depth .",
    "surveys are clearly more sensitive to comets with bright absolute magnitudes and perihelia close to the earth , but the strength of this effect is very hard to estimate @xcite .",
    "* limited range of comets observed : eyeball surveys find few comets fainter than an absolute magnitude of 10 and with perihelia beyond 3au . *",
    "poorly defined photometry : these surveys quote the `` total brightness '' of a comet .",
    "total cometary magnitudes are notoriously unreliable . they are typically measured by defocussing a standard star to the same apparent size as the comet , but this apparent size is heavily dependent on observing conditions and observational set - up .    despite these drawbacks , many attempts have been made to derive the basic parameters of the long period comet population from eyeball - selected historic samples .",
    "the most heroic and influential attempt was that of @xcite .",
    "everhart carried out an exhaustive analysis of the historical circumstances in which comets were discovered , over a 127 year period .",
    "he developed a model for the sensitivity of the human eye , and used it to calculate the period over which a given historical comet could have been seen .",
    "this was then used to estimate the completeness of the comet sample : if a given type of comet was typically seen early in its visibility window , surveys should be complete for this type of comet . if the mean time to find a given type of comet is , however , comparable to the length of the estimated visibility window , the completeness is probably low . using this method",
    ", everhart estimated that for every comet seen , another 31 were missed .",
    "a more modest and recent attempt was that of @xcite .",
    "he restricted himself to the brightest and nearest comets , for which he claimed ( on the basis of discovery trends ) historical surveys were highly complete .",
    "the statistics of these comets were simply extrapolated to larger perihelia and fainter absolute magnitudes , with no correction for observational incompleteness .",
    "as one would expect , the flux of long - period comets through the inner solar system estimated by @xcite is much lower that that estimated by @xcite .    despite these attempts , several basic questions about the demographics of long - period comets",
    "remain unresolved .",
    "one question concerns small comets @xcite : those with nuclear radii less than @xmath0 km ( absolute magnitudes @xmath1 ) . extrapolating the everhart data implies that there should be a large population of such comets .",
    "@xcite was unable to tell whether his model predicted a large population of such comets or not .",
    "a second question concerns the number of comets per unit perihelion .",
    "@xcite found that this number rises from the sun out to 1au , but was unable to determine whether it keeps rising at larger perihelia .",
    "@xcite found no significant rise , but had large enough error bars to bracket both of everhart s possibilities .",
    "the observational situation has changed radically in the last few years .",
    "the advent of large format sensitive ccds has allowed automated surveys to supplant eyeball searches as the main mechanism for finding new long - period comets .",
    "most long period comets are now being found as by - products of various automated searches for near - earth objects , such as the lincoln near - earth asteroid research ( linear ) project @xcite , the catalina sky survey , loneos and neat @xcite .",
    "many are also found by space - based coronagraphs as they approach very close to the sun @xcite , though these are mostly fragments of recently disintegrated larger comets @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i attempt to deduce the statistical properties of the long - period comet population from one of these ccd surveys : the linear survey .",
    "this has a far better defined selection criterion than any historical eyeball survey , and extends to much larger perihelia and fainter absolute magnitudes .",
    "it thus allows both an independent check and an extension of previous estimates of the long - period comet population .    near earth",
    "asteroid ( neo ) surveys are not optimized for comet detection .",
    "while they find many long - period comets , they do not publish their raw data , nor all the details one would like of their exact detection algorithms and sky coverage . in particular , they do not publish on - going photometry of the comets they discover .",
    "nonetheless , enough information is available to make a first pass at estimating the true population of long - period comets from their data .",
    "there have been previous attempts to use these surveys to detemine the true populations of neos ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dormant comets @xcite , but this paper is the first attempt of which i am aware to do this for active comets .    in the next few years",
    ", the situation should further improve , with the advent of a new generation of wide - field survey telescopes , such as skymapper , pan - starrs @xcite and gaia @xcite .",
    "these surveys will predominantly find comets much fainter and more distant than historical surveys .",
    "the analysis in this paper allows a first estimate of just how many long - period comets these surveys can find , and how best to identify them .",
    "i start off by defining a sample of comets drawn from the linear sample , and examining its properties , which are very different from those of eyeball samples (   [ sample ] ) .",
    "a model of the long - period comet population is then generated (   [ model ] ) based on and extrapolating the historical eyeball - selected surveys .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation of this comet population as it would be observed by linear is then developed (   [ montecarlo ] ) .",
    "the results are compared to the observed sample in   [ compmodels ] : i find that the hughes model is quite a good fit to the data , but that the everhart model is not .",
    "i derive my own best - fit model of long - period comet demographics .",
    "the consequences of this new model are many : i examine them in   [ discussion ] before drawing conclusions in   [ conc ] .",
    "of the several near - earth asteroid surveys now under - way , the lincoln near - earth asteroid research ( linear ) project @xcite was most suitable for constraining the long - period comet population .",
    "this is because :    * they discover more comets than any other single survey . *",
    "they publish sky charts on their web page showing the area of the sky observed during each lunation , with the point - source magnitude limit reached at each location . * their sky coverage and",
    "magnitude limit is relatively simple and uniform across this period .",
    "the comet sample was defined as follows :    1 .",
    "the comet has an orbital period longer than 200 years . 2 .",
    "the comet reached perihelion between 2000 jan 1 and 2002 dec 31 .",
    "the comet was either discovered by linear between these dates , or could have been discovered by linear between these dates had it not already been discovered by someone else , or discovered prior to 2000 jan 1 .",
    "the 2000 - 2002 date range was chosen because comet details ( from the catalog of cometary orbits , * ? ? ? * ) and sky - maps ( including limiting magnitudes ) are available .",
    "@xcite listed 25 comets as having been discovered or co - discovered by linear which met our criteria .",
    "i needed , however , to add two additional sub - samples :    * comets discovered prior to 2000 , but which reach perihelion in the period 2000 - 2002 , and which could have been first discovered by linear within this period , had they not already been found .",
    "* comets discovered in 2000 - 2002 inclusive by other surveys , but which would subsequently have been seen by linear during this period .",
    "potential members of the two additional sub - samples were selected from @xcite .",
    "each candidate was checked for its detectability by linear , using the ephemerides and predicted magnitudes generated by the minor planet center .",
    "the predicted positions and brightnesses were compared to the maps of linear sky coverage .",
    "these maps show only the integrated coverage per lunation , not the night - by - night or hour - by - hour coverage , but most of these comets move slowly enough that this should nt much matter .",
    "this process added another 27 comets to our sample .",
    "8 had been detected by linear during 1999 , but reached perihelion in 2000 or 2001 .",
    "most of the remainder were first identified by other near - earth asteroid surveys , particularly the catalina sky survey , loneos and neat .    for every comet in our final sample , the original discovery details ( as distributed by the central bureau of astronomical telegrams ) were checked . from these , the discovery date , discovery magnitude @xmath2 and discovery circumstances were noted .",
    "the discovery magnitudes are total magnitudes ( m1 ) .",
    "it is not clear how reliable and homogeneous these magnitudes are , but no better source of ccd photometry is available . they are based on ccd observations by professional astronomers of typically barely resolved objects , and so should be good to @xmath3mag .",
    "absolute magnitudes @xmath4 were computed from these discovery magnitudes @xmath2 .",
    "the standard equation was used : @xmath5 ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath2 is the observed total magnitude at discovery and @xmath6 a power - law parameterization of the dependence on heliocentric distance . as is conventional for solar system work ,",
    "the absolute magnitude is defined as the observed magnitude if the object were at a distance of 1 au from both the earth and the sun . following @xcite ,",
    "the dynamically new and old comets were treated differently ( the new ones are much brighter at large heliocentric radii , at least on their way in ) .",
    "a comet is classed as dynamically new if its original semi - major axis @xmath7 is @xmath8 10,000 au , old if @xmath9 10,000 au , and undetermined if the orbit class in @xcite is ii or worse . for new comets",
    ", @xmath10 was used if they are seen pre - perihelion and @xmath11 if seen afterward . for old comets ,",
    "the values are 5.0 and 3.5 respectively .",
    "the canonical value of @xmath12 is used for comets of undetermined orbit type .",
    "this is uncertain both because real comets show a dispersion in @xmath6 , and because the @xmath6 values in @xcite are based on observations at smaller heliocentric distances .",
    "it is , however , self - consistent with the analysis used in our monte - carlo simulations .",

    "77% were discovered before reaching perihelion ( fig  [ discover_hist ] ) , and 73% were were first detected when more than 3au from the sun .",
    "the necessity for follow - up potentially introduces two sources of incompleteness into this sample .",
    "firstly , some fraction of objects posted on the neo confirmation page are never followed up in enough detail to determine whether they are comets or not .",
    "timothy spahr kindly provided records of all objects posted to the neo confirmation page in 2000 - 2002 .",
    "only 11% of these were not followed - up well enough to determine an orbit : this places an upper limit on the fractional incompleteness of our sample due to failed follow - up .",
    "this is probably a conservative upper limit : most of these lost objects were most likely either not real to begin with or fast - moving objects only visible for a short window of time .",
    "secondly , some comets might have been inactive at these large heliocentric distances , and hence classified as minor planets .",
    "the minor planet centre database was checked for non - cometary objects on long - period , highly eccentric orbits , but only one was found which reached perihelion within the period 2000 - 2002 : 2002 rn109 .",
    "thus this too is not a major source of incompleteness .",
    "it also shows that most comets down to the linear magnitude limit are still active out to 10au from the sun .",
    "fig  [ q_a ] shows an intriguing correlation between perihelion distance and semi - major axis in the linear sample .",
    "this correlation was first noted by @xcite at smaller perihelia .",
    "they suggested that it was a selection effect .",
    "dynamically new comets are brighter at large heliocentric radii ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "the whipple data did not extend to distances beyond 4au from the sun . if this trend continues to larger heliocentric distances , however",
    ", it would make dynamically new comets far brighter than older comets with the same absolute magnitude .",

    "the distribution of perihelion positions is shown in fig  [ peripos ] .",
    "the comets are weakly concentrated at intermediate galactic latitudes ( fig  [ bhist ] ) , consistent with the galactic tide playing a major part in making them observable @xcite .",
    "the galactic latitude distribution is not , however , significantly different from the predictions of a best - fit model (   [ best ] ) assuming a random distribution , as measured by the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test or the kuiper statistic .",
    "there are also no significant great - circle alignments @xcite .",
    "the linear comet sample was compared against a monte - carlo simulation of the long period comet distribution . in this section",
    "i discuss the parameters used in this simulation .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite studies are based on comets with a limited range of perihelion distances q and hence give only weak constraints on this distribution .",
    "everhart found a factor of two rise in the number of comets per unit perihelion between 0 and 1 au , but beyond that the data are consistent either with a continuing rise or a flat distribution .",
    "hughes found no significant trend in number of comets against perihelion , but his data are quite consistent with such a trend .    on theoretical grounds , however , a gentle rise in the number of comets as a function of perihelion is expected , as comets diffuse into the solar system past the barrier of giant planet perturbations ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a first guess , i chose to model the perihelion distribution as an unbroken straight line : @xmath15 where @xmath16 gives a reasonable fit to the @xcite distribution .",
    "the @xcite slope is shallower , but only shown out to 3au .",
    "the distribution of semi - major axes @xmath7 makes no significant difference to the conclusions , as the comets are all very close to being on parabolic orbits .",
    "i chose to randomly class 40% of comets as dynamically new and given them all @xmath1720,000 , while the remainder were given a value of @xmath7 randomly and uniformly distributed between 1000 and 20,000 au .",
    "the time of perihelion passage , orbital inclination and perihelion direction were randomly chosen to give a uniform distribution on the celestial sphere .",
    "this ignores possible great - circle alignments @xcite and galactic tidal effects @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the absolute magnitude distribution of comets was best fit by a broken power - law , with the break at @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite also found a break at about the same absolute magnitude , but was unable to decide whether it was a real break or simply the effect of increasingly incomplete samples at fainter magnitudes .",
    "to bracket the possibilities , i use a broken power - law of the form .",

    "everhart gives @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "hughes gives @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "if i assume that his observed break is real and not an artefact of sample incompleteness , his plots imply a faint end slope of @xmath28 , which i adopt to bracket the possibilities .",
    "this version of the hughes formulation thus predicts dramatically fewer faint comets , as would be expected as these are the ones for which everhart applies the largest incompleteness correction fraction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give different estimates of the long - period comet flux through the inner solar system .",
    "everhart estimates a flux of 8000 comets with @xmath29 and @xmath30 over 127 years .",
    "hughes estimates a flux of 0.53 comets per year brighter than @xmath31 per unit perihelion .",
    "i ran the simulations using both .",
    "for a given model comet population , the aim is to simulate the observable properties of a sample that matches the selection effects of the linear sample .",
    "the simulation starts off by generating a set of comets that reach perihelion within a three year period .",
    "the comets are randomly generated using the model distributions in the previous section .",
    "the model extends down to @xmath32 and out to @xmath33 .",
    "i generated two model populations : one using the everhart absolute magnitude distribution and flux , the other using the hughes absolute magnitude distribution and flux . in the everhart model",
    "260,000 comets are generated , while only 4,000 are needed in the hughes model .",
    "the position of each comet is then calculated at 24 hour intervals throughout the three year period , and its heliocentric distance @xmath34 , distance from the earth @xmath35 , apparent celestial coordinates and apparent angular velocity written to file .",
    "pure elliptical orbits are used : no attempt is made to allow for planetary perturbations .    at each location , the apparent total magnitude",
    "is then calculated .",
    "comets are notoriously variable in how rapidly their apparent magnitude varies as a function of heliocentric distance .",
    "i parameterize this , as is conventional , using equation  [ eqabsmag ] .",
    "two values of @xmath6 are randomly assigned to each comet : one for before perihelion and another for after .",
    "for the 40% of our simulated comets that i set as dynamically new , the pre - perihelion value of @xmath6 is chosen from a gaussian distribution of mean 2.44 and standard deviation 0.3 .",
    "post - perihelion , the mean is 3.35 with a scatter of 0.27 . for the remaining comets , the pre - perihelion numbers are 5.0 with a scatter of 0.8 , and after perihelion 3.5 with a scatter of 0.5 .",
    "all these values are taken from @xcite . at large distances from the sun ,",
    "cometary activity will presumably stop , and a bare nucleus will have @xmath36 .",
    "the near - ubiquitous detection of fuzz around the linear comets implies , however , that this only happens further from the sun than our models reach .",
    "this approach can only be a rough approximation to the real radial brightness dependence .",
    "the value of @xmath6 for an individual comet is typically time dependent , and all the tabulated values are for comets within @xmath37 au of the sun , whereas our simulation tracks them out beyond 10au .",
    "in addition , comets show occasional flares above and beyond this power - law behavior , which i have not attempted to model .",
    "such flares might introduce an amplification bias , with comets being pushed over the detection threshold . as we will see , however , the slope of the absolute magnitude distribution is so gentle that this is unlikely to be a major effect .",
    "the apparent total magnitude of each simulated comet can now be calculated at any given point in its orbit .",
    "unfortunately , in any ccd - based survey , it is the peak surface brightness of the coma that determines whether something has been seen , not the total magnitude .",
    "the linear skymaps , furthermore , list only the magnitude limit _ for a point source _ at any given location on the sky ( typically around 19 ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , total cometary magnitudes are notoriously unreliable .",
    "quantitative studies prefer more reproducible and physically meaningful parameters such as @xmath38 ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , not enough long period comets have been studied in this way to derive the @xmath39 distribution .",
    "we are therefore forced to attempt some conversion between total magnitudes and point - source equivalent magnitudes .",
    "for bright and near - by comets , this correction can be as large as @xmath13 magnitudes ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the comets in the linear sample were , however , typically first seen when very faint ( fig  [ maghist ] ) , and were generally mistaken for point sources in the initial observation .",
    "we might therefore expect the correction factor to be much smaller , at least when close to the detection threshold .",
    "the histogram of detection magnitudes ( fig  [ maghist ] ) climbs steeply down to @xmath40 , and then falls off fast ( the one comet discovered when fainter than 20th mag was found by spacewatch , which has a fainter magnitude limit ) .",
    "this fall - off occurs at almost exactly the same magnitudes as linear s point source limit , which ranged from around 18 to 20 .",
    "i thus conclude that near the linear detection threshold , total magnitudes and point source equivalent magnitudes are similar .",
    "when generating mock samples , it is only the magnitude near the detection threshold that determines whether or not a given model comet is included in the mock catalog .",
    "the exact value of this correction value was set iteratively .",
    "i initially guess that the point - source equivalent ( pse ) magnitude and total magnitude ( tm ) are the same , and run the simulations of the comet sample .",
    "i use the model that best fits the data (   [ best ] ) to calculate the predicted discovery magnitude distribution , and compare this to the observed distribution .",
    "i then tweak the pse@xmath41tm correction to bring the histograms into agreement .",
    "the best match is obtained when pse@xmath41tm@xmath42 ( fig  [ maghist ] ) .",
    "i use a value of @xmath43 throughout this paper , except where otherwise noted .",
    "the predicted magnitude is corrected for the effects of trailing .",
    "linear exposure times vary from 3 to 12 sec : the latter was used in the correction as it minimised the predicted number of very faint comets . 2   seeing ( fwhm ) was assumed .",
    "trailing makes very little difference , except for the very faintest comets .",
    "linear uses unfiltered ccd magnitudes while the historical surveys use unfiltered visual magnitudes",
    ". these will be somewhat different , due to the different wavelength sensitivity of the human eye and of the linear ccds , but the discrepancy should only be a few tenths of a magnitude at most , and hence is not a dominant source of error .",
    "anoher possible worry : the absolute magnitudes i quote for the comets in the linear sample ( table  [ sampletab ] ) are derived from total magnitudes measured when the comets were barely resolved and far from the sun , using a model for the heliocentric brightness variation .",
    "the absolute magnitudes fit by everhart and hughes are based on observations of highly extended comets observed close to the sun and earth .",
    "these are thus very different quantities , and might well be systematically different , if there is some error in our heliocentric brightness correction , if total magnitudes for barely resolved comets are systematicaly different from total magnitudes for greatly extended comets , or if there is some systematic bias in the discovery magnitudes reported to the central bureau of astronomical telegrams .    to test this ,",
    "i picked out the five comets in the linear sample which were discovered when far ( more than 3.5 au ) from the sun , but which subsequently passed close enough to the earth and sun for traditional small telescope visual magnitude estimates ( within 2au ) .",
    "dan green kindly provided me with compilations of visual magnitude estimates of these comets while they were close to the earth and sun , taken from the archives of the international comet quarterly .",
    "these visual / small telescope magnitude estimates should be broadly comparable to the data on which the everhart and hughes papers were based .",
    "i then compared the predicted magnitudes when close to the sun ( based on the discovery magnitude and the model in this paper ) with the tabulated observations .",
    "there was a considerable scatter in the measured visual magnitudes for each comet : i simply averaged all visual small telescope magnitudes made when the comet was as close as possible to 1au from both sun and earth .",
    "my predicted magnitudes were consistent with the observed values , albeit with a large scatter .",
    "the mean difference ( predicted magnitude minus observed magnitude ) was @xmath44 , where the error indicates the @xmath45 dispersion of the mean .",
    "this is not , alas , a strong constraint , but does indicate that the two magnitude scales are not grossly discrepant .",
    "the final step is to determine whether linear imaged a part of the sky in which the comet was detectable and within its magnitude limit .",
    "the published linear skymaps show that during each dark period in 2000 - 2002 , they attempted to survey the region whose midnight hour angle is in the range @xmath46 , and in the declination range @xmath47 . in winter months with good weather , they surveyed more than 90% of this whole region down to a point - source magnitude limit of better than 19 . in bad months , this dropped to a magnitude limit of around 18.5 over 60% of this region , and occasionally worse .",
    "in the mean month , 72% of this region was surveyed to a visual magnitude limit of 18.5 or better .",
    "the exact pattern surveyed was complex and variable : the only constant was that the densest regions of the galactic plane were avoided .",
    "each field was imaged five times in succession , with 3  12 sec per exposure , once in every dark period .",
    "this sky coverage was approximated as follows .",
    "each comet that enters the @xmath46 , @xmath47 region at any point , with a point - source equivalent ( pse ) magnitude brighter than 19 is considered to have been potentially observable , unless it was within ten degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "if a comet is predicted to be detectable for an entire lunation , it is given a 80% chance of having been detected during that lunation . if it was predicted to be visible for less than the whole lunation , it is given a probability of having been detected equal to 80% of the fraction of the lunation for which is was potentially observable .    does this approximation match the real , more complex selection function ?",
    "this was tested by manually checking 100 simulated comet ephemerides , containing monthly positions and magnitudes , against the real linear sky - maps .",
    "the approximation was found to give a number and absolute magnitude distribution of detected comets indistinguishable from the manually checked sample .",
    "this approach should slightly overestimate the probability of a comet being observed , as comets could be blended with star or galaxy images .",
    "experience suggests that at this relatively bright magnitude limit , this is only a few percent effect at worst , at least away from the denser regions of the galactic plane , which the survey did not cover .",
    "another possible source of error is sky subtraction .",
    "it is unclear exactly how the linear survey do their sky subtraction , but if some of the extended coma emission is included in the sky value , this will artificially suppress the point source equivalent magnitude . the worst case sky subtraction algorithm would be to measure the sky brightness from an annulus close to the comet nucleus .",
    "if i assume that the sky is measured only 5  from the nucleus ( unlikely ) , we can used the observed @xmath48 surface brightness profiles of cometary comae @xcite to show that this sky subtraction algorithm would reduce the measured comet brightness by @xmath49 mag .",
    "more plausible sky subtraction schemes would reduce it by less , or not at all .",
    "thus this too is not a dominant source of error .",
    "in this section , i compare the data to the monte - carlo simulations of what linear would have seen over a three year period . in the scatter plots ,",
    "the data are compared to a single run of the simulation . in all histograms and quoted statistics ,",
    "however , the data are compared against the average or sum ( as appropriate ) of five monte - carlo runs based on the same comet population model .",
    "this summation should suppress the error due to small number statistics in the simulated samples to well below that of the observed sample .",
    "the observed sample properties are first compared against the monte - carlo prediction using the @xcite flux normalization and absolute magnitude distribution .",
    "figs  [ complot_eve ] , [ qhist ] and [ hhist ] compare the distribution of model and observed comets in perihelion @xmath50 and absolute magnitude @xmath4 . the upper boundary to the locus of points is set by the magnitude limit , and seems a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "but the model clearly predicts far too many comets : 2228 as compared to the 52 observed .",
    "the discrepancy is primarily at fainter absolute magnitudes : brighter than @xmath51 the model and data are consistent .",
    "the worst discrepancy is for comets fainter than @xmath52 : ie .",
    "fainter than the data on which everhart based his model .",
    "it is thus a test of the power - law extrapolation .",
    "the model predicts that linear should have seen 1848 comets fainter than @xmath53 , whereas only 12 were seen .",
    "irrespective of the flux normalization , the shape of the absolute magnitude distribution ( fig  [ hhist ] ) is wrong : a ks - test comparison with the observed distribution shows that they are inconsistent with @xmath54 confidence .",
    "is this discrepancy real , or is there some reason why linear would miss faint comets close to the earth ?",
    "the model comets with @xmath55 are predicted to be observable for a median period of 52 days , at a median distance from the earth of @xmath56 au .",
    "their typical apparent angular velocity is predicted to be @xmath57 degrees per day .",
    "their observational properties are thus typical of near earth objects , which linear finds in profusion .",
    "it is thus hard to see what selection effect could prevent their detection .",
    "grant stokes ( personal communication ) confirms that there is nothing in their data analysis which should preclude the discovery of comets like these .",
    "image trailing and short observability windows do reduce the number of these comets seen , but these are already taken into account by the monte - carlo simulation .",
    "could the discrepancy be an artifact of the various approximations made in the model ?",
    "the discrepancy is insensitive to assumptions about the dependence of brightness or comet number on heliocentric distance , as these sources are observed at close to 1au .",
    "one possibility is that i have incorrectly estimated the effective magnitude limit of linear for sources with these apparent total magnitudes . to test this",
    ", i repeated the analysis with a magnitude limit set two magnitudes brighter than my best estimate .",
    "this reduced the discrepancy but did not remove it : the prediction dropped to 577 observed comets fainter than @xmath58 , still more than two orders of magnitude above the data .",
    "none of the plausible incompletenesses in the data , nor other assumptions in the model can come close to removing this discrepancy .",
    "i therefore conclude that the everhart model can not be extrapolated to absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath58 .    even at brighter absolute magnitudes ,",
    "however , there remains a substantial discrepancy .",
    "the model predicts that 188 comets with @xmath59 and @xmath60 should have entered the solar system within the three year period , and that 86% of them ( 162 ) would have been detected by linear .",
    "only 21 such comets were observed .",
    "it is hard to see that linear could have missed many comets this bright passing this close to the sun .",
    "the model predicts that these comets should remain visible for a median 208 days ( 7 lunations ) , so almost regardless of position on the sky , they should have had several opportunities to be observed .",
    "they spend much of this time many magnitudes above the survey detection limit . indeed",
    ", the 21 comets observed with these properties were discovered a median 11 months before perihelion , at a median heliocentric distance of 4.3au , confirming that these are easy targets .",
    "the discrepancy occurs mostly at the fainter magnitudes within this range : brighter than @xmath51 there is no significant difference between the everhart predictions and the linear observations .",
    "i conclude , therefore , that the everhart model fails in two ways .",
    "firstly , the quoted normalization of 8,000 comets per 127 years with @xmath29 and @xmath60 is too high by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "secondly , the faint end slope of the everhart absolute magnitude relation is much too steep , and immensely over - predicts the number of faint comets .",
    "this second conclusion was first reached by @xcite : the current paper independently confirms their result .",
    "both discrepancies suggest that everhart overestimated the incompleteness of his sample of long - period comets .",
    "the discrepancy goes away where the incompleteness correction is small , but is largest at the faint magnitudes where the correction is large .",
    "a discrepancy here is perhaps not surprising , as the correction factors calculated by everhart were so large : he corrected the 256 observed comets to a flux of 8000 : a factor of 31 .",
    "my analysis reduces this correction factor to only @xmath62 .",
    "one possible reason for the difference : everhart calculated the detection threshold for typical historical comet searchers , and assumed that the same threshold applied when searching for comets initially , and when making follow - up observations of known comets . his model was validated by noting that the last observations of comets occurred close to the time when his model suggested that they dropped below detectability .",
    "but let us hypothesize that comets just above the detection threshold might be missed as the telescope speeds past during a scan for new comets , even though they could be detected when looking hard for an already known comet at a known position .",
    "this would reduce the length of time over which a given comet could have been detected .",
    "detections would thus have occurred earlier in the detectability window , and the correction factor for incompleteness would thus decrease .",
    "i now compare the data against a monte - carlo simulation using my version of the @xcite absolute magnitude distribution and normalization , combined with the linearly rising perihelion distribution ( figs  [ qhist ] , [ hhist ] , [ complot_hug ] ) . once again , the overall envelope of points agrees well with the model , giving some confidence that the selection effects have been modeled correctly .",
    "the predictions from the hughes model are in much better agreement with the data .",
    "there is no vast excess of faint predicted comets , implying that the break seen in hughes data was real , and hence that the flatter faint - end slope of the absolute magnitude distribution is more accurate .",
    "neither the perihelion nor absolute magnitude distributions , however , are formally consistent with the observations at the 99% confidence level , as measured by the ks - test .",
    "the overall flux normalization is also too high : the model predicts that linear should have seen 171 comets , rather than the 52 observed .",
    "there is no significant discrepancy within the region in which hughes quoted his flux normalization ( 0.54 comets per year with @xmath63 per unit perihelion ) : the discrepancy is at fainter absolute magnitudes and larger perihelia .",
    "once again the discrepancy is fairly robust against the exact detection limit : dropping the detection threshold by a magnitude reduces the predicted comet numbers to 148 - still too high .",
    "how can this discrepancy be addressed ?",
    "possible incompletenesses in the linear sample were discussed in   [ prop ] and they can at best increase the observed numbers by @xmath64% .",
    "the hughes flux normalization is unlikely to be too low , as it was based on observed counts of very bright comets and made no correction for incompleteness .",
    "i therefore tried to improve the match by tinkering with the absolute magnitude and perihelion distributions .",
    "i first tried reducing the faint end slope of the absolute magnitude relation .",
    "if we assume that the linear sample is 20% incomplete , we need to reduce the faint end slope from 1.07 down to 0.8 to bring the number of predicted comets down to the observed number .",
    "unfortunately , this changes the observed absolute magnitude distribution too much : a ks test shows that a model with this slope predicts an observed @xmath4 distribution inconsistent with the data with greater than 99.99% confidence .",
    "i then tried changing the perihelion distribution . decreasing the slope @xmath65 in eqn  [ perieq ] to zero brought the predicted number of comets down to 95 , but",
    "the perihelion distribution is now too skewed towards small values of @xmath50 ( 99.96% confidence ) .",
    "i next tried combining both approaches . decreasing",
    "the faint end slope to 1.0 , combined with a flat perihelion distribution , brought the predicted numbers into line with the observed numbers .",
    "both the perihelion and absolute magnitude distributions were individually marginally acceptable ( ks - test gave 8 and 5% probabilities of them coming from the same population as the data ) but the joint probability was still uncomfortably low ( though the magnitude limit cut means that the two distributions are not independent , so this should not be taken too seriously ) .",
    "the model predicted too many comets with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and too few in the middle .",
    "moving the location of the break in the absolute magnitude relation to fainter magnitudes was also a failure : given that the comet flux normalisation is at brighter magnitudes , this simply increased the number of fainter comets still further above the observations .",
    "i therefore adopted a different perihelion distribution : one that rises from @xmath68 out to @xmath69 , and is a power - law beyond that .",
    "this preserves the everhart observation of a drop in comet numbers below @xmath70 , while allowing us to tinker with the distribution further out .",
    "the parameterization used was : @xmath71 where @xmath72 controls the behavior at large perihelia .",
    "i then ran a grid of models , varying @xmath72 and the faint end slope of the absolute magnitude distribution ( @xmath22 in equation  [ heq ] ) .",
    "each simulated population was tested against the data in three ways : a ks - test on the perihelion distribution , a ks - test on the absolute magnitude distribution , and a chi squared test on the overall predicted number of comets .",
    "the latter was done for both the observed number of comets and a number 10% higher , to allow for possible incompletenesses .",
    "the lowest of these three significance values was used to compute the goodness - of - fit conutours in fig  [ contour ] .",
    "note that these contours include only random errors : the systematic errors are almost certainly larger , especially on @xmath72 .",
    "the lowest probability rather than the joint probability was used becuase the three tests are not strictly independent .",
    "quite a tight constraint could be placed on @xmath22 : @xmath73 ( 95% confidence , not including systematic errors ) .",
    "the constraint on @xmath72 was weaker : @xmath74 .",
    "no useful constraint could be placed on the bright - end slope @xmath21 : in the modeling i use the @xcite value of 2.2 , but it makes little difference . note that these slopes are often described in the literature using the @xmath75 parameter : @xmath76 , so our best - fit faint end slope has @xmath77 .",
    "the predicted distribution of comets for the best fit model is shown in figs  [ qhist ] , [ hhist ] and [ complot_f ] .",
    "models generated using this model predict @xmath78 ( @xmath45 ) observed comets , in excellent agreement with the data .",

    "my preferred model thus approximately preserves the faint - end slope and normalization derived by hughes .",
    "a flat perihelion distribution is marginally ruled out , and best fits are obtained for one that rises from the sun out to @xmath79 and is either flat or gently falling beyond that .",
    "the best - fit model can be used to estimate the flux of long - period comets through the inner solar system . by definition",
    ", this model uses the @xcite flux of 0.53 comets per year per unit perihelion , brighter than @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite estimated a flux of 8000 long - period comets per 127 years with @xmath29 and @xmath60 .",
    "my model suggests that the flux of comets with these parameters is much lower : 11 long - period comets per year ( 1600 per 127 years ) .",
    "the model suggests that linear is picking up over 60% of comets with these parameters .",
    "i estimate a true flux of 37 comets / year with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , of which linear is detecting @xmath83% .",
    "many published estimates of the number of comets in the oort cloud use the @xcite comet flux as their starting point , and hence should be revised down .",
    "estimates include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the linear sample includes 22 comets with @xmath29 and @xmath60 over a three year period .",
    "5 of these were dynamically new , 11 dynamically old , and 6 had orbit determinations too poor to tell . if we assume that the comets without good orbit determinations break up between new and old in the same ratio as the other comets , we find a flux of 7 dynamically new comets over the three years .",
    "my model suggests that the linear sample is @xmath84% complete for finding comets in this range , implying a total flux of dynamically new comets of @xmath37 per year .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath85 per unit perihelion per year if a uniform perihelion distribution is assumed . this is a factor of @xmath86 lower than was assumed by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite and @xcite assume long - period comet fluxes ( not just the dynamically new ones ) of @xmath87 per year per au down to @xmath29 , compared to my value of @xmath88 . after correction ,",
    "all these estimates come out roughly the same : 1  3 @xmath89 in the outer oort cloud , down to @xmath29 .",
    "if this is extended to fainter absolute magnitudes , i estimate an outer oort cloud population of @xmath90 comets down to @xmath91 .",
    "my model has a much shallower slope of the absolute magnitude distribution than that of @xcite , so the average mass of a comet _ increases_. this cancels out the decreased number of oort cloud comets i predict to give a similar total oort cloud mass to previous estimates ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both of which used a mean mass computed by integrating the everhart curve .",
    "i used two suggested mass - brightness relations to estimate masses from the observed absolute magnitudes : one from @xcite and one from @xcite .",
    "note that this relation is extremely uncertain - very few long - period comets have had even their nuclear magnitudes measured .",
    "the average mass is crucially dependent on the slope of the bright end of the absolute magnitude distribution , which the data in this paper do not constrain .",
    "i bracket the possibilities by using both the everhart and hughes values ( 3.54 and 2.2 respectively ) .",
    "i use my own estimate of the faint - end slope .    for the everhart bright - end slope , the total mass converges as you go to brighter magnitudes",
    ": the bulk of the mass resides in comets with @xmath92 . for the hughes bright - end slope , however , the total mass diverges as you count brighter comets .",
    "the bright comets are rare , but their mass goes up faster than their number goes down at bright magnitudes .",
    "thus for the weissman mass relation , comets with @xmath93 are 10,000 times more massive than those with @xmath94 .",
    "the hughes bright - end slope , however , suggests that they are only 2,600 times less common , so the total mass in the brighter comets is actually four times greater . for the everhart bright - end slope ,",

    "the everhart slope is thus physically more appealing , as it avoids the need for a bright cut - off .",
    "given the success of both the hughes normalization and faint - end slope in fitting our sample , however , his bright - end slope should perhaps be taken seriously , leading to the prospect of an oort cloud dominated ( in mass terms ) by very large comets . in this section",

    "firstly , the non - detection of interstellar comets in the linear sample places an upper limit on their space density .",

    "i will assume that interstellar comets have the same absolute magnitude distribution that i derive for long period comets , and that their apparent brightness varies with heliocentric distance in the same way as dynamically new inbound comets in our model .",
    "given these assumptions , and an assumed magnitude limit of 19 ( point source equivalent ) , one can derive the distance @xmath34 out to which a comet with any given absolute magnitude could have been detected . to convert this into the volume surveyed during the three years of the survey",

    "the mean number of comets seen over the three years is then evaluated as a function of the assumed average density . if more than 5 comets are predicted to have been observed , the poisson probability of us having not seen any interstellar comets is less than 5% : this is our adopted limit .",

    "a survey reaching 24th magnitude ( perhaps panstarrs ) would place 95% upper limits of @xmath129 , and might hence detect one or two interstellar comets if @xmath123 is very large .",
    "@xcite reached similar conclusions .",
    "a survey reaching 26th magnitude ( lsst ? ) would push the limit down to @xmath130 , which would be enough to detect or rule out a large value of @xmath123 .",
    "this prediction does , however , depend crucially on the assumed brightness behavior of comets a long way from the sun .",
    "simple models which assume that oort cloud comets have an isotropic velocity dispersion imply a constant number of comets per unit perihelion .",
    "@xmath6-body integrations ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast , imply a rising number of comets at larger perihelia , due to the diffusion process of comets past the perturbations of the giant planets .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite , for example , predict an increase in the number of comets per unit perihelion of @xmath131 between @xmath69 and @xmath132 ( though this is an extrapolation of the wiegert & tremaine model which is only shown out to @xmath133 ) . is this consistent with the linear sample ?    the best - fit model has the number of comets per unit perihelion ( beyond @xmath134 ) going as a power law of index @xmath74 ( 95% confidence ) , ie .",
    "a gentle _ fall_. to get a rise in numbers consistent with the @xcite and @xcite predictions , we require @xmath135 , which is inconsistent with our model with 99% confidence .",
    "the measured perihelion distribution is , however , somewhat degenerate with the assumed dependence of comet brightness on heliocentric distance : @xmath6 in equation  [ eqabsmag ] .",
    "as i have repeatedly noted , the choice of @xmath6 is an approximation based on extrapolations of observations obtained at much smaller heliocentric distances .",
    "we can estimate the change in @xmath6 that would be needed to bring our observations into line with the @xcite predictions .",
    "we need to drop the predicted brightnesses of comets with @xmath136 by enough to reduce the observed numbers by 50% , to meet our 95% upper limit . given our best - fit absolute magnitude relation , this requires that @xmath6 be increased by @xmath137 .",
    "this is quite a small rise - well within the observed scatter of @xmath6 values seen at lower perihelia .",
    "if , for example , i had used the canonical value of @xmath12 for all comets , rather than our more complex scheme , this would make dynamically new comets much fainter when far from the sun , as required ( at the expense of the correlation seen in fig  [ q_a ] ) .",
    "the data in this paper , while suggestive , are not therefore significantly at odds with the theoretical predictions . a better understanding of heliocentric brightness variations when distant from the sun will be needed to see if this anomaly is real .",
    "the faint - end slope of the absolute magnitude relation derived in this paper ( @xmath138 ) is very flat : the number of comets per unit magnitude barely increases as you go fainter .",
    "this presumably indicates that small comets are not that much more abundant than large ones . if the absolute magnitudes are converted to nuclear masses , using either the @xcite or @xcite relations , i find that the differential number of comets per unit mass @xmath139 goes as : @xmath140    @xcite made the case for the existence of small comets : those with nuclei only meters to tens of meters in radius .",
    "if we assume the @xcite relationship between mass and absolute magnitude , and a density of @xmath141 , 100 m radius corresponds to @xmath142 and 10 m to @xmath143 .",
    "linear is therefore detecting at least a few comets with nuclei smaller than 100 m .",
    "similar small comets are also detected by the lasco instrument on the soho spacecraft @xcite , though these are mostly fragments of recently disintegrated larger comets @xcite .",
    "@xcite was unclear on whether the shallow faint - end slope was real or a selection effect : i confirm that it is real .",
    "@xcite pointed out that small long - period comets must be rare from statistics of comets passing close to the earth .",
    "@xcite found a similar paucity of small jupiter - family comets .    in this section ,",
    "i point out that the shallowness of the faint - end slope is actually quite interesting theoretically .",
    "collisions are rare in the oort cloud @xcite , so the nuclear size distribution should remain largely unchanged from when the proto - comets were planetesimals expelled from the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the size distribution of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "these models imply that 100 m diameter objects should outnumber 2 km sized objects by a factor of @xmath144 ( per unit log radius ) in the oldest disks modeled .",
    "our faint - end slope , however , if combined with the @xcite mass / absolute magnitude relation , implies a ratio of only @xmath145 .",
    "the size distribution of planetesimals may be greatly modified by collisions while they lie within the dense environment of the proto - planetary disk .",
    "most models of this collisional evolution also , however , predict much flatter size distributions than we see : they typically predict an increase in comet numbers , even at faint magnitudes , of a factor of @xmath146 per magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is much greater than my measurement ( @xmath147 ) .    as noted in ",
    "[ eve ] , our shallow faint - end slope is quite robust to sample incompletenesses and model assumptions .",
    "the conversion of absolute magnitudes to radii is , however , highly uncertain even at bright magnitudes , let alone the faint absolute magnitudes of relevance here .",
    "theoretical predictions are also quite uncertain @xcite , and may be consistent with this slope .",
    "another possibility , however , is that the probability of a planetesimal escaping the protoplanetary disk and reaching the oort cloud is size - dependent .",
    "@xcite , for example , suggested that collisions between planetesimals would act to circularize their orbits , and would prevent them from escaping into the oort cloud until the density of planetesimals was greatly depleted ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the square - cube law would suggest that this effect is most serious for smaller planetesimals , which may be ground down to dust before escaping .",
    "this could thus explain the deficit of small comets .",
    "alternatively , gas drag could play the same role : the largely gaseous nature of the giant planets indicates that the protoplanetary disk was still full of gas when the giant planets formed .",
    "no published modelling currently includes this effect .",
    "another possibility : the square - cube law implies that small comets may loose their volatiles faster than large ones .",
    "fading may thus be more severe for these comets , making them harder to detect .",
    "a final possibility is that comets have been exposed to high temperatures at some point in their history .",
    "the resultant loss of volatiles could thus destroy small comets without much affecting the numbers of large ones .",
    "@xcite tentatively suggest this as a reason for the lack of jupiter - family comets with small nuclei .",
    "long period comets might have been exposed to high temperatures while still in the proto - planetary disk .",
    "once in the oort cloud , temperatures are much lower .",
    "nearby supernovae and o - stars may have temporarily heated them enough to remove some volatiles @xcite , but this should not appreciably affect the numbers of small comets .",
    "i note in passing that my models are strongly inconsistent with the claims by @xcite for an immense population of small comets bombarding the earth .",
    "these claims have , however , already been ruled out in many other ways ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      the model in this paper can be used to guide future automated comet - searches .",
    "the most basic conclusion follows from the shallow faint - end slope of the number / absolute magnitude relation .",
    "this means that to find more comets , a survey should always try to maximize the area covered rather than going deep in a small area . if linear , for example , exposed for six times as long per field , it would be sensitive to fainter comets , and would hence see @xmath148 times more comets per unit area .",
    "but it would cover a six times smaller area .",
    "the more frequently a survey covers a given area of sky , the higher the probability of a given comet being detected . in fig  [ freq ] , however , i show that this is not an enormous effect : decreasing the survey frequency for a hypothetical survey from weekly to biannual only drops the number of detected comets by @xmath64% .",
    "the comets lost are primarily those with fainter absolute magnitudes , because their visibility period is small .",
    "the small number lost is a direct consequence of the shallow faint - end slope : there are few small comets to lose .    in fig",
    "[ faint ] , i show the predicted samples that would be found by telescopes using a similar survey technique to linear , but going deeper .",
    "the deeper limit essentially increases the absolute magnitude limit reached at all perihelia , and by increasing the time over which comets are visible , also improves the completeness for brighter comets . over 3 years , a survey to 20th mag would detect 103 comets , to 22nd mag would detect 150 and to 24th mag , 186 comets .",
    "this is much fewer than @xcite estimated .",
    "the discrepancy is probably due to my shallow inferred absolute magnitude and perihelion distributions , which mean that the dramatic increase in sensitivity of these surveys as compared to linear only yields a relatively small increase in sample size .",
    "i conclude that telescopes such as skymapper , panstarrs and lsst , each capable of surveying large areas to deeper than 22nd magnitude , should be capable of detecting more than 50 long - period comets per year",
    ". a substantial fraction of these are forecast to have perihelia beyond 10au , though this conclusion relies upon the rather shaky assumptions of how brightness varies with heliocentric distance this far out .",
    "thus five years should suffice to build up a quantitatively selected sample of long - period comets equal in size to any historical sample .",
    "six main conclusions can be drawn from this analysis :    1 .",
    "the outer oort cloud contains @xmath90 comets down to @xmath91 ( @xmath149 comets down to @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is 2  10 times fewer comets than previous published estimates . 2 .",
    "the average mass of these comets is , however , higher than previous estimates . down to @xmath58 ,",
    "the average mass is between @xmath99 g and @xmath101 g , leading to a total mass in the outer oort cloud of 2  40 earth masses , comparable to or larger than previous estimates . the mass of the oort cloud may be dominated by a few large comets .",
    "small comets do exist , but are rarer than predicted by many models",
    ". this may be because they have difficulty escaping from the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the probability of the earth being hit by a long - period comet similar in energy to the tunguska impactor is only one in forty million per year .",
    "i place an upper limit on the space density of interstellar comets of @xmath150 per cubic au ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "this is still an order of magnitude above our revised prediction for the space density of interstellar comets .",
    "the number of long - period comets per unit perihelion seems to decline , or at best rise slowly beyond 2au .",
    "this does not agree with theoretical predictions .",
    "the discrepancy may be resolved if comets are fainter at large heliocentric distances than i assume .",
    "future survey telescopes should be able to assemble samples of several hundred long - period comets in a few years of operation .",
    "the major weakness in this analysis is in the photometry : in particular in our limited understanding of how the brightness of comets varies with heliocentric distance when far from the sun , and in how to convert ill - defined total magnitudes into more reproducible and physically meaningful parameters such as @xmath39 . the data exist to address these problems , but are not publicly available .",
    "i would like to thank grant kennedy , eriita jones and chris weekes for their work on aspects of this paper , stephen pravdo and grant stokes for responding to e - mail questions about their neo surveys , timothy spahr for providing details of objects posted to the neo confirmation page , and dan green for provide magnitude measurements from the archives of the international comet quarterly .",
    "paul weissmann was referee on an earlier version of this paper : his detailed comments were invaluable in educating the author ( an extragalactic astronomer by training ) in comet lore ."
