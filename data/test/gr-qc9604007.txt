    "when a quantum field theory is constructed on a curved background spacetime , the gravitationally induced vacuum polarization typically induces a non - zero vacuum expectation value for the stress - energy tensor  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that fully self consistent calculations are horrendously difficult ; consequently most calculations in the literature are carried out in the test - field limit .",
    "( wherein the vacuum polarization is _ not _ permitted to back - react on the geometry via the einstein field equations . ) even in the test - field limit , most known results are obtained by numerical ( rather than analytic ) computations .    _ perturbative _ self - consistent solutions around flat spacetime have recently been investigated by flanagan and wald  @xcite , building on earlier work of horowitz  @xcite , and horowitz and wald  @xcite .",
    "another type of energy condition , based on the `` quantum inequalities '' , is investigated for a schwarzschild background in recent papers by ford and roman  @xcite .",
    "ford and roman have also discussed the anec and awec in ( 1 + 1)dimensional and ( 3 + 1)dimensional evaporating black holes ( unruh vacuum )  @xcite , and for the ( 1 + 1)dimensional boulware vacuum .",
    "in contrast , the present paper works strictly in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and treats the equilibrium hartle  hawking vacuum state .",
    "now we know , on rather general grounds ( the existence of the hawking radiation effect and concomitant violation of the _ classical _ area increase theorem of black hole dynamics ) that at least some of the energy conditions must be violated at or near the event horizon of a black hole . in this paper",
    "i shall explore these issues in a little more detail .",
    "i shall continue to work in the test - field limit : i discuss the effect of the gravitational vacuum polarization on various energy conditions .",
    "in particular , i discuss the point - wise null , weak , strong , and dominant energy conditions ( nec , wec , sec , and dec ) , the averaged null energy condition ( anec ) , and shall furthermore introduce and discuss several new , potentially interesting , energy conditions ( pnec , scri ",
    "nec , and scri  anec ) .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "i restrict attention to the most well - studied curved - space quantum field theory : the conformally - coupled massless scalar field on schwarzschild spacetime , in the hartle  hawking vacuum",
    ". for this geometry and vacuum state one has both ( 1 ) a useful analytic approximation to the gravitational polarization ",
    "page s approximation  @xcite , and ( 2 ) numerical estimates of the vacuum polarization  see the numerical calculations of howard  @xcite , howard and candelas  @xcite , and anderson , hiscock , and samuel  @xcite . )",
    "having established the basic machinery in this paper , a study of the boulware vacuum will be presented in a companion paper , while further studies of the unruh vacua should be straightforward , although tedious .",
    "( for the current state of affairs in the unruh vacuum , see  @xcite . ) similarly , extensions to non - conformal couplings , massive scalars , and reissner ",
    "nordstrm geometries should be straightforward .",
    "to set the stage , recall some basic definitions  + * definition [ nec ] * * definition [ anec ] * here @xmath0 is a generalized affine parameter ( see  @xcite ) for the null curve , the tangent vector being denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "note that in almost all applications it suffices to consider null geodesics , rather than generic null curves .",
    "however , isolated discussions of the anec on non  geodesic null curves do occur in the literature  @xcite  the extended definition presented here allows one to compare and contrast the present results with other calculations .    as a practical matter",
    "i shall often replace the word `` inextendible '' by the phrase `` inextendible past the event horizon '' .",
    "this is a purely pragmatic decision based on a lack of numerical data inside the event horizon , coupled with the general feeling in the community that page s analytic approximation will become progressively worse as one approaches the central singularity .",
    "( thus my studies of the anec can more precisely be referred to as studies of a `` truncated  anec '' . )    in an earlier publication  @xcite , ( see also  @xcite ) , i derived a no - go theorem for the anec : i showed that the anec is violated ( in the test - field limit ) whenever the background spacetime has a non - zero _ scale anomaly_. specifically , i proved the + * anec no - go theorem * this no - go theorem , since it depends on a special case of the quantum field theoretic ( conformal ) anomaly , is known to be independent of the choice of vacuum state .",
    "( one can easily generalize this argument to include non - conformally coupled fields , see  @xcite . )    unfortunately , a brief calculation suffices to show that the tensor @xmath2 vanishes on schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "indeed it vanishes on any ricci - flat spacetime ( or indeed on any spacetime conformal to an einstein spacetime ) .",
    "thus schwarzschild spacetime avoids the no  go theorem enunciated above , and it becomes a matter of explicit checking to see whether or not the anec is satisfied or violated on this geometry . note that in doing this explicit checking we will have to be cognizant of our particular choice of vacuum state , and indeed our results will also depend on the particular class of null geodesics under consideration .",
    "in performing the explicit checks alluded to above , i have found it useful to define several new energy conditions that are in some sense intermediate between the nec and anec :    * definition [ pnec ] * now , if one does not place any further constraints on the set @xmath3 the resulting definition , while general , is not particularly useful .",
    "( it is best used as a diagnostic tool to probe interesting regions of the tangent bundle . ) a suitable restriction is :    * definition [ scri  nec ] * ( this definition basically says that one should not worry too much if violations of the nec occur only when one looks along null geodesics that never make it out to null infinity . )    we shall soon see that in the hartle  hawking vacuum the gravitational vacuum polarization of a conformally - coupled massless scalar field residing on the schwarzschild background geometry everywhere satisfies this scri  nec energy condition , though it does not everywhere satisfy the nec . we shall also use the pnec to investigate the regions in phase space ( the tangent bundle ) where suitable positivity conditions hold .    finally , for completeness , i enunciate + * definition [ scri  anec ] * ( this definition basically says that one should not worry too much if violations of the anec occur only along null geodesics that never make it out to null infinity .",

    "nec it automatically follows that , in the hartle  hawking vacuum , the gravitational vacuum polarization of a conformally coupled scalar field residing on the schwarzschild background geometry satisfies this scri  anec .",
    "we shall also see that not all null geodesics satisfy the anec itself .",
