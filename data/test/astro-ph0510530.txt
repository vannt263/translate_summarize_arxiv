    "the x - ray sky as seen by x - ray satellites over the past 40 years , shows a substantially different picture than for example the optical band .",
    "while the visual night sky is dominated by main sequence stars , galactic binary systems and super nova remnants form the brightest objects in the x - rays .",
    "common to both regimes is the dominance of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) toward lower fluxes . in the x - ray range itself , one observes a slightly different population of agn at soft and at hard x - rays . below 5 kev the x - ray sky is dominated by agn of the seyfert 1 type , above the absorbed seyfert 2 objects appear to become more numerous .",
    "these type 2 agn are also the main contributors to the cosmic x - ray background above 5 kev @xcite , although only @xmath5 of the xrb above @xmath6 can be resolved @xcite . beside the rather persistent seyfert galaxies ,",
    "also blazars are detectable in the hard x - rays . because of the fact that we look into a highly relativistic jet in the case of those sources , the blazars exhibit strong variability on all time - scales and are especially variable in the x - ray and high - energy gamma - ray domain . for an overview over the various extragalactic x - ray surveys",
    "see brandt & hasinger ( 2005 ) , and for early _ integral _ results see krivonos et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray energy range is not currently accessible to x - ray telescopes using grazing incidence mirror systems .",
    "instead detectors without spatial resolution like the pds @xcite on _ bepposax _ ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) and osse @xcite on _ cgro _ ( gehrels et al .",
    "1993 ) have been applied .",
    "a synopsis of these previous results is as follows : the 2  10 kev seyfert  1 continua are approximated by a @xmath7 powerlaw form @xcite",
    ". a flattening above @xmath8 has been noted , and is commonly attributed to compton reflection @xcite .",
    "there is a great deal of additional detail in this spectral domain - `` warm '' absorption , multiple - velocity component outflows , and relativistic line broadening - which are beyond the scope of this paper . the seyfert  2 objects are more poorly categorized here , but the general belief is that they are intrinsically equivalent to the seyfert  1s , but viewed through much larger absorption columns [ see e.g. vron - cetty & vron ( 2000 ) for a recent review ] .    above 20",
    "kev the empirical picture is less clear .",
    "the @xmath9 continuum shape of both seyfert types is consistent with a thermal comptonization spectral form , although in all but a few cases the data are not sufficiently constraining to rule out a pure powerlaw form .",
    "nonetheless , the non - thermal scenarios with pure powerlaw continua extending to @xmath10 energies reported in the pre-_cgro _ era are no longer widely believed , and are likely a result of background systematics . however , a detailed picture of the comptonizing plasma - its spatial , dynamical , and thermo - dynamic structure - is not known . among the critical determinations which _ integral _ or future hard x - ray instruments will hopefully provide are the plasma temperature and optical depth ( or compton `` y '' parameter ) for a large sample of objects .    the other major class of gamma - ray emitting agn - the blazars ( fsrqs and bl lac objects ) are even more poorly constrained in the _ integral _ spectral domain .",
    "the detection of @xmath11 of theses objects with the egret instrument on _ cgro _ in the 1990s has established the presence of @xmath12 relativistic plasma at small angles to the observers line of sight .",
    "the so called `` tev '' blazars are similar objects but with the peak power shifted to even greater energies , probably due to an even smaller viewing angle ( see for example , fossati et al . 1999 , and for earlier _ integral _ results pian et al . 2005 ) . the most common interpretation of the broad - band continuum emission is the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model , although the external compton models ( ec ) are still also plausible . broad - band temporal coverage can in principle discriminate between these possibilities , although each of these components can separately contribute to the hard - x - ray band under extreme circumstances .",
    "the _ integral _ bandpass covers a critical region which can in principle establish the amplitude and shape of the high - end synchrotron component or or low - end ssc component .",
    "critical to each of these issues is the need to obtain improved continuum measurements over the hard x - ray to soft gamma - ray range for as large a sample of objects as possible . _ integral _",
    "@xcite , since its launch in october 2002 , offers unprecedented @xmath13 collecting area and state of the art detector electronics and background rejection capabilities .",
    "thus it offers hope of substantial gains in our knowledge of the agn phenomenon .",
    "we were thus motivated at this juncture some three years into the mission , to formulated and present the collective look at the data so far obtained and assess the potential for progress in the _ integral _ era .    as the satellite spent most of its observing time up to now concentrating on the galactic plane , some low - latitude agn have been detected .",
    "observations at higher galactic latitude have also led to studies of individual sources : 3c  273 @xcite , ngc  4388 @xcite , ( sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ) , the s5  0716 + 714 field @xcite , @xcite , ngc  4151 ( beckmann et al . 2005 ) , six agn near the galactic plane ( soldi et al . 2005 ) , and an early study of all extragalactic sources seen through the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "two of the new sources discovered by _",
    "integral _ , and igr  j21247 + 5058 , have also been shown to be agn @xcite .    with the on - going observation of the sky by _ integral _ ,",
    "a sufficient amount of data is now accessible to compile the first _ integral _ catalog of agn . in this paper",
    "we present analysis of recent observations performed by the _",
    "integral _ satellite instruments ibis / isgri , spi , and jem - x , and compare the results with previous studies .",
    "observations in the x - ray to soft gamma - ray domain have been performed by the instruments on - board the _ integral _ satellite @xcite .",
    "this mission offers the unique possibility to perform simultaneous observations over the @xmath14 energy region .",
    "this is achieved by the x - ray monitor ( 230 kev ) jem - x @xcite , the soft gamma - ray imager ( 201000 kev ) isgri @xcite , and the spectrograph spi @xcite , which operates in the 20  8000 kev region .",
    "each of these instruments employs the coded - aperture technique @xcite .",
    "in addition to these data an optical monitor ( omc , mas - hesse et al .",
    "2003 ) provides photometric measurements in the @xmath15 band .",
    "data used for the analysis presented here were all in the public domain by the end of march 2005 .",
    "this includes data from orbit revolutions 19 - 137 and revolutions 142 - 149 .",
    "data before revolution 19 have been excluded as the instruments settings changed frequently and therefore the data from this period are not suitable to be included into a homogeneous survey .",
    "most of the _ integral _ observing time has been spent on the galactic plane so far , with some deep exposures at high galactic latitude , for example in the virgo and the centaurus region .",
    "our sample objects have been selected in three ways .",
    "the first criterion was a detection in the isgri data in a single pointed observation .",
    "the duration of one pointing of the spacecraft is usually 2 - 3 ks long .",
    "the standard analysis of the data is performed at the _ integral _ science data centre ( isdc ; courvoisier et al .",
    "these results are publicly available . within one pointing the detection threshold for a source in the center of the field of view of isgri",
    "is about @xmath16 .",
    "a second level search was done using combined data sets of individual observations and contained within separate revolutions which are about 3 days long . in cases where an observation lasted longer than a revolution ,",
    "the data set was split by revolution .",
    "the results from this analysis are publicly available through the heasarc archive .",
    "clearly the sensitivity of this second method depends strongly on the duration of the analyzed observation .",
    "the sensitivity also depends on the dither pattern of the observation and on the position of the source within the field of view .",
    "in addition to those two ways of combining the list of agn seen by _ integral _ , we added all agn which have been reported as _ integral _",
    "detections so far in the literature",
    ". this combined list of objects is presented in table  [ catalog ] . in order to get meaningful results for each of the sources in this agn sample",
    ", it was necessary to perform an individual analysis for each one .",
    "we used the data for which the spacecraft was pointed within 10 degrees radius about each agn for isgri and spi , and within 5 degrees for jem - x .",
    "the exposure times listed in tab .  [ catalog ] refer to the effective isgri values .",
    "these values are approximately the same for the spectrograph spi , but for the jem - x monitor it has to be taken into account that they cover a much smaller sky area .",
    "thus in the case of dithering observation , the source is not always in the field of view of the monitors , and the exposure times are correspondingly shorter .",
    "the analysis was performed using the offline science analysis ( osa ) software version 5.0 distributed by the isdc ( courvoisier et al .",
    "this version shows substantial improvement compared to the previous osa 4.2 version , except for the jem - x spectral extraction , for which we used the march 15 , 2005 version of the osa .",
    "the significances listed in tab .  [ catalog ] have been derived by using the osa software for isgri ( 20  40 kev ) , spi ( 20  40 kev ) , and jem - x ( 2  20 kev ) . in cases where there were no publicly available data covering the source position",
    ", we put `` n / a '' in the significance column . in those cases where no jem - x or spi detection was achieved , ``  ''",
    "is written .",
    "for comparison we list the photon flux measured by _",
    "cgro_/osse in the @xmath17 energy band , as reported by johnson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for seyfert galaxies and by mcnaron - brown et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for blazars .",
    "apart from gamma - ray bursts , no extragalactic source detections by ibis / picsit have been reported .    the analysis of the _",
    "integral_/ibis data is based on a cross - correlation procedure between the recorded image on the detector plane and a decoding array derived from the mask pattern @xcite .",
    "the isgri spectra have been extracted from the count rate and variance mosaic images at the position of the source , which in all cases corresponds to the brightest pixel in the @xmath18 band .",
    "the spi analysis was done using the specific analysis software @xcite including version 9.2 of the reconstruction software spiros @xcite which is based on the `` iterative removal of sources '' technique ( iros ; hammersley et al .",
    "1992 ) : a simple image of the field of view is made using a mapping technique which is optimized for finding a source assuming that the data can be explained by only that source plus background .",
    "the mapping gives the approximate location and intensity of the source , which are then improved by maximizing a measure of the goodness of fit .",
    "the residuals of the fit are used as the input for a further image reconstruction and source search @xcite .",
    "the fitting process is easier when an input catalog is provided . in this work we used the source positions found with isgri as an input catalog for the spi analysis , as the sensitivity of isgri is higher than that of spi below 200 kev .",
    "with respect to the calibration uncertainty , the ibis instrument team stated that the systematic error is of the order of 1.5% ( 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "nevertheless , this value corresponds to on - axis observations within a short period of time with no disturbing influence , such as enhanced background activity",
    ". a combined fit of crab spectra taken in revolution 43 , 44 , 120 , 170 , and 239 , i.e. over a 1.5 year span of the mission , shows a larger uncertainty in the flux .",
    "the scale of diversity , assuming that crab is a source with constant flux , gives some hint what is the scale of discrepancies in count rates observed in various conditions , i.e. , with different dithering patterns or instrumental settings . clearly the absolute calibration can not be more precise than the observed variations . hence , it seems that for the 22 - 120 kev band we may conclude that the joint @xmath19 uncertainty of the spectral extraction method and the calibration files is about @xmath20 .",
    "it may happen that for other sources and in some special circumstances we may encounter a larger discrepancy especially for faint sources , but a systematic error of 5% should be a valid approximation . in most cases",
    "the fit to the data from the three instruments used in this work did not show any improvement when adding variable cross - calibration .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that most spectra have low signal - to - noise and adding a further parameter to the fit procedure worsens the fit result , according to an f - test .",
    "the spectral shape calibration was also tested on _ integral _ crab observations . with the so - called canonical model for the crab showing a single power law with photon index @xmath21 @xcite ,",
    "the values retrieved from _ integral _ are @xmath21 ( jem - x ) , and @xmath22 for spi and isgri @xcite .",
    "it should be kept in mind though that the crab is significantly brighter than the sources discussed here , and systematic effects might depend on source brightness .",
    "all the extracted images and source results are available in electronic form .      _",
    "cgro_/osse @xcite covered the energy range @xmath23 .",
    "it therefore preferentially detected agn with hard and bright x - ray spectra , which we also expect to be detectable by _",
    "integral_. several of the agn detected by osse have not been seen by _ integral _ so far .",

    "a single powerlaw fit with absorption from material in the line of sight has been applied to the _ integral _ spectra of all sources and the results are presented in table  [ fitresults ] and in figure  [ fig : photonindices ] .",
    "the errors on the photon indices are 90% confidence errors .",
    "the intrinsic absorption was determined by subtracting the galactic hydrogen column density from the total absorption as measured in the soft x - rays . in the cases where the _ integral_/jem - x data were not available or",
    "did not restrict the absorption column density sufficiently , values from the literature have been used to fix this component in the spectral fit ( tab .",
    "[ fitresults ] ) .",
    "no systematic error has been added to the data .",
    "the spectral fitting was done using version 11.3.2 of xspec @xcite . in most cases",
    "a single powerlaw gave an acceptable fit to the data , which also is based on the fact that the signal - to - noise of many of the spectral data is rather low . in six cases",
    "a cut - off power law fit led to better fits results .",
    "we report those results in table  [ cutoff ] .      in order to investigate the spectra of agn subtypes ,",
    "we have derived averaged spectra of the seyfert 1 and 2 types , as well as for the intermediate seyferts and the blazars , and according to the intrinsic absorption .",
    "the average seyfert 1 spectrum was constructed using the weighted mean of 10 isgri spectra , the seyfert 2 composite spectrum includes 15 sources , and 8 objects form the intermediate seyfert 1.5 group .",
    "the two brightest sources , cen  a and ngc  4151 , have been excluded from the analysis as their high signal - to - noise ratio would dominate the averaged spectra .",
    "the average spectra have been constructed by computing the weighted mean of all fit results on the individual sources as shown in table  [ fitresults ] . in order to do so",
    ", all spectra had been fit by an absorbed single powerlaw model . when computing the weighted average of the various sub classes , the seyfert 2 objects show flatter hard x - ray spectra ( @xmath2 ) than the seyfert 1.5 ( @xmath25 ) , and seyfert 1 appear to have the steepest spectra ( @xmath26 ) together with the blazars ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the classification according to the seyfert type of the objects is based on optical observations .",
    "an approach to classify sources due to their properties in the x - rays can be done by separating the sources with high intrinsic absorption ( @xmath28 ) from those objects which do not show significant absorption in the soft x - rays .",
    "it has to be pointed out that not all objects which show high intrinsic absorption in the x - rays are classified as seyfert  2 galaxies in the optical , and the same applies for the other agn sub - types .",

    "the blazars have again been excluded from these samples .",
    "spectra are presented in this paper for _ integral _ sources which are as yet not published and for which at least two instruments yield a detection of @xmath31 .",

    "it has to be kept in mind that the results in this study are based on _",
    "bepposax_/pds spectra alone , without taking into account the valuable information from the lower energy lecs / mecs data , which could have significantly constrained the shape of the underlying continuum .",
    "the _ integral _ agn sample confirms the previously found trend with harder spectra for the obscured objects .",
    "this can be roughly understood by the argument that in order to overcome a substantial absorption , obscured objects have to have hard x - ray spectra to be detectable . comparing the ratio @xmath144 of obscured ( @xmath28 ) to unobscured agn we find in",
    "the _ integral _ data that @xmath145 . excluding the targets of observations ,",

    "[ catalog ] ) .",
    "this sub - sample includes 32  agn , with 18 obscured and 10 unobscured objects ( absorption information is missing for the remaining four objects ) . using only the complete sample changes the ratio to @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( targets excluded ) , respectively . splitting this result up into objects near the galactic plane ( @xmath149 ) and off the plane shows for all objects a ratio of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "this trend shows that the harder spectra of those objects , where the absorption in the line of sight through the galaxy is low compared to the intrinsic absorption , are more likely to shine through the galactic plane .",
    "one would expect a higher ratio in order to explain the unresolved x - ray background in this energy range ( e.g. worsley et al .",
    "but it has to be taken into account that our sample only represents the high flux and low luminosity sources ( @xmath152 ) in the local universe ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "gilli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the ratio between type 2 and all qsos should be at most 2 in the local universe .",
    "the _ bepposax _",

    "( 2005 ) find that both effects combined ( the fraction of absorbed agn decreases with the intrinsic x - ray luminosity , and increases with the redshift ) can be explained by a luminosity - dependent density evolution model . they further show that the luminosity function of agn , like those presented here , peaks at @xmath154 while high luminosity agn peak at @xmath155 .",
    "consistent with our study , la franca et al .",

    "these investigations have been focused so far on the x - rays below 10 kev , and _ integral _ can add substantial information to the nature of bright agns in the local universe .",
    "considering the expected composition of the hard x - ray background , it is remarkable that our sample includes only 4 compton thick agn .",
    "if compton thick agn are dominant in the hard x - rays , they would have to be fainter than the objects detected by _",
    "integral _ so far .    the energy range in the 15  200 kev is now also accessible through the bat instrument aboard _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "a study by markwardt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) of observations of the extragalactic sky indicates a ratio of @xmath161 between obscured and unobscured agn , fully consistent with the results from the _ integral _ agn sample .",
    "although the _ swift_/bat survey covers different areas of the sky , the energy band is similar to the _",
    "integral_/isgri range and the type of agns detectable should be the same .",
    "the sample presented here is still too small to constrain the ratio of obscured to unobscured sources , but it might indicate that the unified model predicts this value of @xmath162 correctly , differing from earlier claims @xcite .",
    "the agn sample derived from the _ integral _ public data archive comprises 42 low luminosity and low redshift ( @xmath152 , @xmath163 , excluding the blazars ) objects including 5  blazars in the hard x - ray domain . only one galaxy cluster",
    "is also detected , but no star - burst galaxy has been as yet . the results from the jem - x2 , isgri , and spi data show that within the statistical limitations of the data the high - energy continua of agn can be described by a simple powerlaw with photon index @xmath4 ( seyfert 1 ) , @xmath3 ( seyfert 1.5 ) , and @xmath2 ( seyfert 2 ) .",
    "a similar trend is seen when dividing the seyfert galaxies according to their intrinsic absorption into unabsorbed ( @xmath164 ; @xmath165 ) and absorbed sources ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "blazars naturally show strongly variable spectra , but the average spectral slope is of the same order ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "it has to be taken into account that the simple model does not represent the data as soon as a sufficient signal - to - noise is apparent , like in the circinus galaxy and cen  a @xcite or ngc  4151 @xcite .",
    "but the average spectra indicate that a cut - off in most cases , if apparent , appears at energies @xmath167 .",
    "the agn sample presented here is complete down to a significance limit of @xmath168 .",
    "this results in a complete sample of 32  agn . within this complete sample",
    "the ratio between obscured and unobscured agn is @xmath147 , consistent with the unified model for agn and with recent results from the _ swift_/bat survey .",
    "only 4 compton thick agn are found in the whole and only 3 in the complete sample .",
