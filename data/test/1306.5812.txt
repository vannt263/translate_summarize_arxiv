    "note that the @xmath115 in the expression encoding the @xmath40-equation does not enter the @xmath31-equation since variation with respect to @xmath47 yields the post - variational condition on the multiplier @xmath116 .",

    "thus i consider qualitative toy models with simple maths , for which i have considered some of the regimes .",
    "once one needs to work approximately in qm , two of the first ports of call are perturbation methods and variational methods . in semiclassical quantum cosmology , there is a nontrivial merging of classical and quantum concepts for perturbations and variations , which is considered for perturbations in @xcite and for variational methods in the present article and @xcite .    what is to be used as the variational trial wavefunction in quantum cosmology ?",
    "a plain product ansatz is the simplest , but a latter - day slater might suggest a better from physical principles concerning the nature of inhomogeneous quantum fluctuations in the early universe . for the halliwell  hawking model , one can split the wavefunction up mode by mode ( [ mbm ] ) and the wavefunction for each mode is itself a product of scalar ( s ) , vector ( v ) , tensor ( t ) parts ( [ svt ] ) .",
    "this is some sort of variational trial wavefunction parallelling the plain ( as opposed to slater antisymmetric fermionic ) hartree  fock trial wavefunction . in this",
    "regard , triangleland falls rather short as a model for a new fourth reason after those listed in the introduction : it has no mode expansion or s  v  t decomposition .",
    "one can have a smaller product - type trial wavefunction , @xmath117 . including s  v ",
