    "the properties of spin ladder systems attracted considerable interest in the past decade.@xcite it was shown@xcite that even - leg ladder models develop a gap in their excitation spectrum if the rung coupling is ferromagnetic .",
    "this result could be considered as a generalization of haldane s conjucture@xcite about the existence of a finite gap in integer spin heisenberg chains , since for strong enough ferromagnetic rung coupling the spin ladder with spin-@xmath0 on the legs is equivalent to a spin chain of spin-@xmath1 . in this case",
    "the ground state is an aklt like state@xcite in which short range valence bonds couple spins on neighboring rungs .",
    "later it was demonstrated numerically,@xcite that a gap is generated for antiferromagnetic rung coupling as well , in which case the singlet valence bonds are formed predominantly on the rungs .",
    "it may be called a _",
    "rung singlet _ state",
    ". both are haldane - type spin liquids in which there are no broken local symmetries , and the excitations are coherent magnons with a finite gap .",
    "similar situation occurs if the two legs of the ladder are coupled not by rung couplings , but diagonally or by plaquette couplings.@xcite when these couplings compete with each other , non - haldane spin liquid phases , characterized by the absence of coherent magnon excitations and spontaneous dimerization,@xcitemay occur due to frustration effects .",
    "although the thermodynamic properties of haldane and non - haldane spin liquids are identical , the correlation functions differ due to the difference in the excitations spectrum . the two phases could also be distinguished by a local dimer order parameter .    beside",
    "these spin liquid phases several other phases may occur , like ferromagnetic or incommensurate phases .",
    "when drawing the phase diagram , it was thought for some time that the concept of haldane - like spin liquids is unambiguous for spin ladders , and therefore the aklt - like and rung singlet phases are identical not only thermodynamically , but also in the sense , that in a large parameter space , where rung , diagonal and plaquette couplings are all taken into account , one could go from one to the other without any discontinuity .",
    "in fact , it was argued@xcite that there is a controlled way of changing the parameters gradually and interpolate continuously between two limiting cases belonging trivially to one or to the other phase .",
    "the procedure contains a shift of one of the legs of the ladder by one unit , thereby transforming a rung singlet into a diagonally situated valence bond , characteristic of the the aklt - like state , or vice versa .",
    "however , as was pointed out by kim _",
    "et al._@xcite this shift changes the topology of the system drastically .",
    "when we start from an open ladder , the above transformation deforms the usual straight - end ladder into a `` ladder '' whose ends are cut diagonally . such a deformation has serious consequences on the degeneracy of the ground state for open boundary condition . in a usual ladder",
    "the aklt state has a fourfold degeneracy due to the unpaired end spins , while the rung singlet state is unique . on the other hand , in the diagonally cut ladder",
    "the ground state is unique for the aklt state , and fourfold degenerate in the rung singlet state .",
    "this is best seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : topo](a ) and ( b ) , where the typical valence - bond configurations of the aklt - like state and the rung singlet state are shown . in fig .  [ fig : topo](c ) we also show a typical valence bond configuration of the dimer phase . in this phase",
    "the invariance of translation by one rung is broken spontaneously .",
    "while in the aklt state the number of valence bonds crossing an arbitrary vertical line between rungs is always _ odd _ , in the rung singlet state it is always _",
    "even_. this is true not only in this special configuration but remains valid generally , as long as the range of valence bonds is short compared to the size of the system.@xcite the two states can be distinguished by a topological quantum number .",
    "thus for topological reasons in a spin ladder the two haldane - type spin liquid phases are different and in the space of couplings they must be separated by a phase transition hyperplane,@xcite although extended gapless ( critical ) regions between them can not be excluded a priori either .    since the topological quantum number is not accessible to direct computation , a generalization of the hidden order parameter of the spin-1 chain@xcite was proposed,@xcite that could distinguish between the even and odd topological sectors of the haldane phase .",
    "although the relationship between the two new string order parameters and the two types of haldane phases was made plausible by looking at special configurations , it was not possible to calculate their value , since the bosonization procedure applied to obtain the phase transition lines did not distinguish between the two parameters .",
    "the aim of this paper is to do a numerical study of the relationship between the possible spin liquid phases of the spin ladders and the string order parameter , using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) procedure.@xcite the setup of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a short description of the ladder models and a brief account of what is known about the possible phases .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are presented in sec .",
    "finally sec .",
    "iv contains a brief summary .",
    "following the notations of ref .",
    "[ kolezhuk ] we will write the most general form of the hamiltonian for isotropic two - leg spin ladder models if only spins on the same and neighboring rungs interact , as @xmath2 where @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : plaquett ] ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 are spin-1/2 operators corresponding to spins sitting on the two legs of the ladder . the schematic plot of the spin couplings in @xmath6 between the spins on the two legs of the ladder are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ham ] .    the terms with @xmath7 and @xmath8 couple neighbouring spins on the same legs , the terms with @xmath9 and @xmath10 spins on the same rung , while the terms with @xmath11 and @xmath12 spins that are situated diagonally .",
    "in addition to these bilinear terms there could be three biquadratic terms with couplings @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in order to decrease the number of parameters from now on we only consider the case when @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". the energy scale will be set by fixing @xmath19 .",
    "it is known from previous studies@xcite that all the interleg couplings @xmath20 , when acting alone , generate a haldane - like phase .",
    "this is an aklt - like phase with odd topology of the number of valence bonds if @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 , while for opposite sign of the couplings a rung singlet like state with even topology is generated .    as mentioned",
    "before , the goal of the present paper is to identify an appropriate order parameter that can characterize the spin liquid phases .",
    "starting from the string order parameter of the @xmath26 chain proposed by den nijs and rommelse@xcite , it is natural to generalize it to spin ladders by defining the order parameter of aklt - like haldane state as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total spin on rung @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    since in the extreme limits the pure rung singlet state can be related to the aklt state by a shift of one of the legs , the string order parameter of the haldane state with even topological quantum number",
    "is expected to be @xmath32 where @xmath28 is now the sum of two diagonally situated spins , @xmath33.@xcite    in what follows we will calculate the order parameters for the @xmath34 component only , they will be denoted as @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we will show , that these two order parameters are mutually exclusive .",
    "@xmath35 is finite for the aklt - like haldane state , while @xmath36 is finite for the rung singlet like haldane phase .",
    "moreover the order parameter goes to zero continuously at the transition point when the transition is of second order , while it vanishes with a jump in case of first order transitions .",
    "to investigate this problem we performed numerical calculations applying the dmrg method@xcite on the model defined by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp1 ] ) .",
    "since the dmrg procedure is more accurate for systems with free ends , we consider our ladder model with open boundary condition . in order to eliminate the fourfold degeneracy of the ground state in the conventional haldane phase due to the free @xmath37 spins at the ends of the ladder",
    ", we exploited the left - right reflection symmetry of the system .",
    "out of the four degenerate ground state we have selected the one with @xmath38 and positive parity . the calculations were done for chains with up to 150 sites keeping 100 to 200 states per block .",
    "the truncation error varied in the range @xmath39 to @xmath40 . in most of the calculations we used the finite - lattice method with two or three iteration cycles .",
    "in order to reduce the undesirable boundary effects we fixed site @xmath29 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : string_odd ] ) and ( [ eq : string_even ] ) at the center of the chain and let site @xmath41 run through half of the chain .",
    "the finite size scaling procedure was used to determine the thermodynamic limit of the quantitities measured .    in what follows we present our numerical results for the string order parameters for various choices of the coupling constants . since our aim was not to explore the full phase diagram , but rather to check how the string order parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 vary as we go from one haldane - like phase to another , topologically different gapped phase , we calculated the string order parameters along specially chosen paths connecting points in the parameter space , where the model is known to belong to different phases .",
    "it is worth pointing out that since the ground state wave function and therefore the ground state expectation values of operators can be calculated more accurately than those of excited states , the order parameters provide a better way to obtain phase diagrams than investigating the energy spectrum .",
    "the effect of @xmath42 alone was analysed numerically for short systems in ref .",
    "[ nishi ] .",
    "it was found there that for @xmath43 the order parameter @xmath35 is finite , while for @xmath44 the other order parameter @xmath36 is finite . our results with the dmrg method confirmed these results .",
    "from earlier works@xcite it is known , that not only the rung but also the diagonal and plaquette inter - leg couplings are relevant perturbations which generate a gap and drive the system into phases with topological order . depending on the sign of the perturbation the emerging phases belong to one of the two possible topological sectors .",
    "we have therefore investigated the effect of these couplings by doing calculations at two specialy chosen values . the finite size scaling analysis of the results obtained for couplings @xmath45 or @xmath46 indicated that irrespective whether only one or both diagonal couplings are present , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for positive @xmath11 or @xmath49 , while we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 for negative @xmath11 or @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , calculations for the values @xmath52 of the couplings @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the other couplings set to zero ) convinced us that the even order parameter is finite , @xmath53 , for @xmath54 , or @xmath55 or @xmath56 , while the odd order parameter is finite , @xmath57 , for opposite signs of the couplings , i.e. , for @xmath23 , or @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "our results obtained for the string order parameters allows us to conclude that the topology of the valence bond structure can be identified directly by calculating the order parameters @xmath35 or @xmath36 , since they mutually exclude each other .",
    "next we consider the subspace spanned by @xmath42 and @xmath49 . according to the recent bosonization study@xcite",
    "the phase transition line separating the two topological sectors is of first order in the quadrant @xmath58 , @xmath22 , while of second order in the quadrant @xmath59 , @xmath60 . in order to check the behavior of the string order parameter ,",
    "we have calculated them along two paths in the @xmath61 parameter space .",
    "path 1 is defined by @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and path 2 is parametrized by @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "they are indicated by solid lines on fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23_phase ] .    our numerical results for @xmath36 and @xmath35 obtained in the thermodynamic limit along path 1",
    "is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23 ] .",
    "the lines connecting the points are only guides to the eye .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that @xmath36 is finite in one particular region while @xmath35 in the other .",
    "as one sees from the figure the string order parameters , extrapolated to the infinite ladder limit , have a jump discontinuity at the transition point . in order to further support the first order nature of the phase transition we have also investigated the low lying energy spectrum .",
    "we found that there is a sudden change in the degeneracy of the ground state at the transition point . in the case of open ladders",
    "the fourfold degeneracy of the aklt phase associated with spin-1/2 end - spins disappear , and the ground state becomes unique as a rung - dimer - like structure emerges .",
    "moreover , by examining higher lying energy levels we found that the energy gap remains finite throughout the transition .",
    "the ground state energy shows a cusp - like singularity , a characteristic feature of first order transitions , as is shown on the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23 ] .",
    "note , however , that for finite chains there is no observable level crossing in the ground state due to hybridization .",
    "next we consider the behavior of the order parameters calculated along path 2 in the negative @xmath42 and @xmath49 quadrant .",
    "our results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23_a ] . in this case",
    "again , only one of the order parameters is finite in a particular phase , however , the gap vanishes continuously at the phase boundary , which is a characteristic features of second order phase transitions .",
    "it is worth noting that there is an order of magnitude difference in the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23_a ] as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "since the phase transition points were located on two special trajectories only , the phase boundary that separates the two types of haldane - like phases is drawn by dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j23_phase ] to indicate that its exact shape was not determined .      in order to consider the influence of the plaquette couplings we have chosen the special values @xmath66 , @xmath67 , since the phase diagram has already been studied for this parametrization.@xcite this choice has been motivated by the possible mapping of the ladder model to the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic chain for @xmath68.@xcite here we calculate string order parameters along four lines going through the expected phase boundaries shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : j145_j23_phase ] .    calculations along path 1 have revealed that @xmath35 is finite in the aklt - like haldane phase , but it vanishes in the dimerized phase . on the other hand , @xmath36 becomes finite in the dimerized phase , thus the two phases are well distinguished by the order parameters .",
    "examining the trajectory ( path 2 ) going through the phase boundary between the rung singlet like haldane and dimerized phases , we have found that @xmath36 remains finite and @xmath35 scales to zero everywhere .",
    "this shows that the string order parameter does not uniquely characterize the haldane phase , it is rather an indicator of the topology of the valence bond structure , since both the rung singlet and the dimerized phases have even topological quantum numbers .",
    "thus when @xmath50 , the string order is not sufficient to classify unambiguously the ground state .",
    "another order parameter , the so - called _ dimer order _ parameter has to be measured .",
    "taking the difference of the local energy on neighboring bonds in the middle of the ladder this order parameter is defined as @xmath69 } \\,.\\ ] ] in the haldane - type spin liquids @xmath70 vanishes , but there exists an extended region in the parameter space , where the dimer order parameter scales to finite value in the thermodynamic limit , signaling a dimerized phase with spontaneously broken translational symmetry .    next let us consider the @xmath71 half - plane focusing on the @xmath72 half - line and its vicinity .",
    "calculation of the order parameters along path 3 , defined by @xmath73 with @xmath74 revealed that @xmath36 is finite for @xmath75 , while @xmath35 is finite for @xmath76 . at @xmath72 all order parameters including @xmath70 vanish as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j1_j2_j3 ] .",
    "since the string order parameters become finite for arbitrary small finite value of @xmath49 the two types of spin liquids are separated by a critical line and the extended critical phase reported earlier@xcite does not exist .    finally , it can be seen on the figure that for @xmath77 both order parameters vanish and a new phase appears . in order to analyze the question",
    "whether the new phase develops just above the @xmath78 point , we investigated the vicinity of the @xmath78 point along path 4 .",
    "we found that @xmath35 remains finite up to @xmath79 while @xmath36 vanishes for the whole regime .",
    "investigating the low lying energy spectra we found a multiply degenerate ground state . in order to decide whether this phase extends to the @xmath49 axis we made test calculations at @xmath80 , @xmath81 and found a finite @xmath35 but vanishing @xmath36 order parameters .",
    "this suggests the schematic phase boundary shown by a dashed line in the figure .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the relationship between various gapped haldane and non - haldane spin liquid phases and the two different string order parameters in the general two - leg spin ladder model , containing rung , diagonal and plaquette couplings as well .",
    "the string order parameters have been calculated numerically using the dmrg method .",
    "it has been found that there are two kinds of haldane - type massive spin liquids characterized by finite @xmath82 or @xmath83 string order parameters , respectively .",
    "it was shown that @xmath35 is finite in the aklt - like phase , while @xmath36 is finite in the rung singlet like phase .",
    "examining the transition from the aklt - like to the rung - singlet - like phases the type of phase transition can be first or second order depending on the path in parameter space , and this shows up in the abrupt or continuous vanishing of the order parameter .",
    "when plaquette couplings are allowed for , non - haldane - like spin liquid phases can occur , and the string order parameters are not sufficient to characterize the phases .",
    "@xmath36 remains finite in the dimerized phases , too .",
    "thus the string order parameter reflects the topology of the valence bond structure and does not characterize uniquely the haldane - type phases .",
    "a dimer order parameter can , however , be defined , which is finite in a non - haldane - type dimer phases but vanishes in haldane - type spin liquids .",
    "it was found previously that there exists a small range of the parameters where the combination of perturbing operators is irrelevant and the spectrum remains massless . investigating the vicinity of @xmath84 axis we have found that both string order parameters vanish on this critical line , but @xmath36 or @xmath35 becomes finite immediately as we move away from this axis .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the two kind of spin liquids are separated by a critical line and not by an extended gapless regime reported earlier . in addition , around the @xmath85 line for @xmath86 we have found a new phase .",
