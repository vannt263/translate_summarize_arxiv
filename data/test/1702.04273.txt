    "there is presently a great interest in the study of the radiative heat transfer between closely placed objects @xcite .",
    "the reason for that is the experimental verification of the prediction that the radiative heat transfer between two bodies can be greatly enhanced when they are brought sufficiently close to each other @xcite .",
    "this enhancement can lead to overcome the far - field limit set by the stefan - boltzmann law for black bodies and it takes place when the gap between the two objects is smaller than the thermal wavelength ( 9.6 @xmath0 m at room temperature ) .",
    "such an enhanced thermal radiation exchange originates from the contribution of evanescent waves that dominate the near - field regime and by now it has been observed in numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments have in turn triggered off the hope that near - field radiative heat transfer ( nfrht ) could lead to new applications in the context of thermal technologies such as thermophotovoltaics @xcite , heat - assisted magnetic recording @xcite , scanning thermal microscopy @xcite , nanolithography @xcite or thermal management @xcite , just to mention a few .    the theoretical description of nfrht is usually done in the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics ( fe ) introduced by rytov in the 1950s @xcite . in this framework , it is assumed that the thermal radiation is generated by random , thermally activated electric currents in the interior of a material .",
    "these currents vanish on average , but their correlations are given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "thus , the technical problem involved in the description of the radiative heat transfer between two finite objects is to find the solution of the stochastic maxwell equations with random electric current as radiation sources",
    ". this problem can be quite challenging and an analytical solution can only be obtained in a few cases with simple geometries like , for instance , two parallel plates @xcite , two spheres @xcite or a sphere in front of a plate @xcite . in general , in order to solve this problem for complex geometries , which is usually necessary for a comparison with the experiments , one has to resort to numerical methods . in this respect",
    ", a lot of progress has been done in recent years and standard numerical methods in electromagnetism have already been combined with fe to describe nfrht between objects of arbitrary size and shape ( for a review see ref .",
    "those methods include , among others , the scattering matrix approach @xcite , the finite - difference time- and frequency - domain methods @xcite , the boundary element method @xcite , and volumen - integral - equation methods @xcite .",
    "recently francoeur and coworkers adapted the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) to describe the nfrht between two optically isotropic objects of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "this new approach has been termed as thermal discrete dipole approximation ( tdda ) .",
    "it describes the nfrht between two bodies in the framework of fe by discretizing the objects in terms of point dipoles in the spirit of the dda method that is widely used for describing the scattering and absorption of light by small particles @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to generalize the tdda method to describe the radiative heat transfer and the thermal emission in magneto - optical ( mo ) systems .",
    "mo objects are of great interest in the context of nfrht .",
    "thus for instance , in a recent work by some of us we showed that the nfrht between two parallel plates made of doped semiconductors can be largely tuned by applying a static external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "doped semiconductors under a magnetic field present a sizable mo activity , that can be controlled by changing the magnitude and the direction of the field .",
    "more recently , it has been predicted that the nfrht between several mo particles , also made of doped semiconductors , can lead to the appearance of striking phenomena such a near - field thermal hall effect @xcite or the existence of a persistent directional heat current @xcite .    motivated by these recent developments in the context of nfrht of mo systems , we present here a generalization of the tdda method to describe the radiative heat transfer between mo objects of arbitrary shape , something that is still missing in the literature .",
    "to be precise , we present a tdda method that is valid for optically anisotropic systems that can be described by an arbitrary electric permittivity tensor ( with @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also extend the tdda approach to describe the thermal emission of a finite object ( both mo and non - mo ) .",
    "moreover , we correct some basic errors of previous formulations of the tdda method and use our generalized approach to provide a rigorous demonstration of the kirchhoff law relating the emissivity and absorptivity of a finite mo object . finally , we also provide the correct expression for the radiative heat transfer between mo dipoles , which is the basis to study many - body effects in systems of non - reciprocal particles .",
    "our work is focused on the analysis of homogeneous mo objects with constant temperatures , but it can be straightforwardly generalized to more complicated situations including the description of nonhomogeneous materials or situations with complicated temperature profiles .",
    "our work provides a practical method to investigate many interesting effects in the context of the thermal emission and nfrht between mo systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - dda ]",
    "we review the dda method for mo systems that we use as a starting point for our generalized tdda approach .",

    "in particular , we derive here the definition of the directional , polarization - dependent emissivity that has to be compared with the corresponding absorption cross section to prove kirchhoff s law . in section [ sec - results ]",
    "we present the numerical results obtained for the thermal radiation and radiative heat transfer between different objects of arbitrary size and shape .",
    "this section illustrates both the validity and the capabilities of the formalisms developed in the previous sections .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec - conclusions ] with some additional remarks about our tdda approach and the main conclusions of our work . on the other hand ,",
    "we have included two appendixes where we present some convergence tests and an explanation of the main differences between our tdda approach and previous formulations ( appendix a ) and an alternative derivation of the main result of section [ sec - tdda ] ( appendix b ) .",
