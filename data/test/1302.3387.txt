    "_ semigroups _ , sets of objects close under composition but not inversion , like for instance the set of all matrices and explicit runge  kutta methods , are also well studied in literature .    however , there are important examples of objects that are neither a group nor a semigroup .",
    "one important case is the class of objects closed under a ` sandwich - type ' product , @xmath0 .",

    "spaces closed under such products are called symmetric spaces and are the objects of study in this paper .",
    "there is a parallel between the theory of lie groups and that of symmetric spaces . for lie groups ,",
    "fundamental tools are the lie algebra ( tangent space at the identity , closed under commutation ) and the exponential map from the lie algebra to the lie group . in the theory of symmetric spaces",

    "an important decomposition theorem is associated with symmetric spaces and lie triple systems : lie algebras can be decomposed into a direct sum of a lts and a subalgebra",
    ". the well known splitting of a matrix as a sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix is an example of such a decomposition , the skew symmetric matrices are closed under commutators , while the symmetric matrices are closed under double commutators .",
    "similarly , at the group level , there are decompositions of lie groups into a product of a symmetric space and a lie subgroup .",
    "the matrix polar decomposition , where a matrix is written as the product of a symmetric positive definite matrix and an orthogonal matrix is one example .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the application of such structures to the numerical analysis of differential equations of evolution .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 we review some general theory of symmetric spaces and lie triple systems .",
    "applications of this theory in numerical analysis of differential equations are discussed in  3 , which , in turn , can be divided into two parts . in the first (  3.13.3 )",

    "the paper  @xcite is concerned with important recurrence relations for polar - type decompositions , similar to the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula for lie groups , while @xcite employ this theory to reduce the implementation costs of numerical methods on lie groups @xcite .",

    "the main goal is then to remove from the numerical method the _ undesired _ part of the error ( either the one destroying the symmetry or the reversing symmetry ) .",
    "these error terms in the modified vector field generally consist of complicated derivatives of the vector field itself and are not explicitly calculated , they are just used formally for analysis of the method . in this context , the main tools are compositions at the group level , using the flow of the numerical method and the symmetries / reversing symmetries , together with their inverses .",
    "there is a substantial difference between preserving reversing symmetries and symmetries for a numerical method : the first can be always be attained by a finite ( 2 steps ) composition ( scovel projection @xcite ) , the second requires in general an infinite composition . thus symmetries are generally more difficult to retain than reversing symmetries . for the retention of symmetry , we review the thue ",
    "morse symmetrization technique for arbitrary methods and present a new yoshida - like symmetry retention technique for self - adjoint methods .",

    "we illustrate the use of these symmetrisation methods by some numerical experiments .",
    "finally , section  4 is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we present some background theory for symmetric spaces and lie triple systems .",
