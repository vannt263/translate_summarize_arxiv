    "understanding the origin and evolution of hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars would have a significant impact on several areas of astronomy .",
    "for example , it is important in the study of globular cluster hb morphology , which constrains the formation history of the galaxy ( searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "the global picture of hb morphology appears to be well understood .",
    "hb morphology is most affected by the metallicity of the cluster : more metal rich clusters exhibit redder hbs ( `` the first parameter '' of hb morphology ) .",
    "however , observations in some globular clusters show hbs which exhibit color distributions not expected for their metallicities . to explain this deviation ,",
    "a `` second parameter '' is invoked .",
    "age has been the most successful global candidate for the `` second parameter '' ( searle & zinn 1978 ; lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ; for recent review , see stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ) . however , recent observations show an increasing number of hb morphologies with anomalous features , e.g. bimodality in the color ( temperature ) distribution , extended blue tails , and gaps ( e.g. , sosin et al .",
    "1997 ; rich et al . 1997 ; catelan et al . 1998 ) .",
    "most of these anomalies are found near the blue end of the hb . within the framework of the canonical theory of single star evolution , they appear to be inconsistent with a scenario where metallicity and age are the only two parameters that govern the hb morphology .",
    "ngc6791 is an extreme example that exhibits deviations from the first and second parameter phenomena .",
    "this open cluster is believed to be extremely metal - rich , [ fe / h ] @xmath0  0.5 ( friel & janes 1993 ; kaluzny & rucinski 1995 ; peterson & green 1998 ) , which would suggest a predominantly red hb clump , following the first parameter phenomenon . yet ,",
    "nearly a third of its helium burning population ( hb stars ) are extremely blue ( liebert et al . 1994 ; green et al . 1997 ) with a large temperature separation from the red clump .",
    "dynamical effects do not seem to provide a promising explanation for this anomaly , because stellar densities are small in open clusters .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and a synthetic hb model based on canonical stellar models .",
    "the observed cmd of ngc6791 , which is from kaluzny & rucinski ( 1995 ) , shows approximately 23 red clump stars and 9 hot stars .",
    "these hot stars have also been identified by ultraviolet ( uv ) observations using the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( landsman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the synthetic hb ( diamonds ) is based on the arbitrarily chosen chemical composition , i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath1 and @xmath2 ( equivalent to @xmath3 ) . for illustrative purposes , a 9 gyr isochrone from the main sequence ( ms ) to the red giant branch ( rgb ) ,",
    "is shown on the same plot . for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the match is reasonable .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to derive the age of this cluster or any other parameters by matching the cmd with isochrones .    for the synthetic hb construction",
    ", we have assumed a gaussian mass dispersion parameter @xmath6 , and a reimers mass loss parameter @xmath7 ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 ; willson , bowen , & struck 1996 ) .",
    "readers are referred to yi , demarque , & oemler ( 1997b ) for details of the synthetic hb construction .",
    "we assume that there are approximately 32 hb stars in ngc6791 , and we have added some random scatter in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the model reproduces , in accordance with the first parameter phenomenon , the prominent red clump seen in the data , but it lacks hot stars .",
    "ngc6791 is the oldest galactic open cluster known to - date at 6.5 - 9 gyr ( demarque , green , & guenther 1992 ; phelps et al . 1994 ; garvanich et al .",
    "1994 ; chaboyer , green , & liebert 1999 ) . the most recent estimate from chaboyer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggests @xmath10 gyr for the age of this cluster .",
    "however , even at the largest age estimate so far ( 9 gyr ) , a synthetic hb based on the conventional input parameters would not reproduce anything even close to the hb morphology of ngc6791 . by increasing its age by a couple of gyrs",
    ", we could produce some hot hb stars , but their numbers would still be much smaller than observed .",
    "thus , the age effect alone seems unsuccessful in explaining the hb color distribution .",
    "a relatively large value of the dispersion ( @xmath11 , in comparison to the conventional value 0.03  0.04 ) in the gaussian mass distribution on the hb would result in a larger fraction of hot hb stars .",
    "this may match the blue - to - red hb star ratio found in ngc6791 better , but the strong color - bimodality in ngc6791 would not be reproduced .",
    "one or more local parameters must be at work in this cluster . as candidate mechanisms that produce hot hb stars ,",
    "a few additional scenarios have been proposed lately .",
    "sweigart ( 1997 ) has suggested that helium mixing on the red giant branch would cause further evolution beyond the tip , resulting in higher mass loss on the giant branch . as the color dispersion on the hb is the result of varying envelope masses , the enhanced mass loss results in a bluer hb .",
    "dcruz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) assumed an episode of extreme mass loss at the tip of the giant branch to explain blue hb stars .    in this letter , we explore yet another possible formation scenario for blue hb stars : mass loss during the core helium burning phase .",
    "demarque & eder ( 1985 ) first investigated this effect for low metallicity hb stars , and we extend on their work here .",
    "we will show that the inclusion of mass loss on the hb works in the direction of explaining the color distribution of the hb stars in ngc6791 .",
    "we used the yale stellar evolution code ( yrec ) for the construction of hb evolutionary models .",
    "the detail of physics are the same as in guenther et al .",
    "( 1992 ) with the addition of updated opacities . for log @xmath12 ,",
    "opal opacities are used ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , and alexander low temperature opacities are used for log @xmath13 ( alexander & ferguson 1994 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 of the mixing length to pressure scale height in the convection zone , was assumed to be 1.9 , which is the value used in a standard solar model with the same input physics ( guenther et al .",
    "this parameter only affects the radii of the very coolest models , and has little impact on our conclusions .",
    "although he diffusion and complex heavy element segregation processes are known to take place in the atmospheres of sdb and sdo stars ( michaud , vauclair , & vauclair 1983 ; michaud et al .",
    "1985 ; unglaub & bues 1998 ) , their effect to the internal structure and radius calculation is negligible .    in addition , a mass - loss routine was included into yrec . as we propose no mechanism for mass loss , and any empirical mass loss rate , such as reimers mass loss ( which is based on red supergiant observations ) , does not apply here , the simplest approach was taken .",
    "the mass loss rate , which is supplied by the user , is assumed to be constant over time , and is used to determine the amount of mass loss for a given time step .",
    "this mass is then removed from the envelope , which is taken here to be the region of the hydrogen burning shell and outward , at each time step .",
    "the model is then allowed to evolve with its new mass .",
    "the energy needed to eject the mass against the gravitational field is also calculated and removed from the envelope ( see also , koopmann et al .",
    "1994 and demarque & eder 1985 ) .    while mass loss on the hb is an _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption , it is possible to justify at least some mass loss .",
    "mass loss is directly observed in the sun at a rate of @xmath15 .",
    "it has also been pointed out that mass loss should be enhanced in pulsating stars ( willson 1988 ) .",
    "as rr lyrae stars are pulsators on the horizontal branch , one should expect some mass loss in these stars .",
    "there is also both observational and theoretical evidence for pulsation in hot horizontal branch stars .",
    "recent observations show that sdb stars pulsate as well ( kilkenny et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "this pulsation was predicted theoretically by charpinet et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "the effect of mass loss in hb stars while they evolve through the instability strip was studied by koopmann et al .",
    "they found that the mass loss rate has an upper limit of @xmath16 .",
    "a higher mass loss rate would break the good agreement between synthetic and observed hbs in the globular cluster m4 .",
    "this provides an upper limit for the mass loss rate on the hb in the intermediate temperature ( rr lyrae ) region .",
    "hb stars hotter than rr lyrae variables may be in conditions under which larger mass loss may take place . according to abbott s formula ( 1982 ) ,",
    "the mass loss rate for these stars for the solar composition should be around 2  4 @xmath17 .",
    "we can think of two effects which should increase this number .",
    "the first is the fact that the sdb stars pulsate .",
    "second is that the mass loss rate should scale with the metallicity ( abbott 1982 ; willson et al .",
    "1996 ; lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) , so the assumption of higher mass loss rate in more metal rich stars , such as the blue hb stars in ngc6791 , could be justified .",
    "although it would be very difficult to observe directly such low mass loss rates in hb stars , there is spectroscopic evidence which supports the presence of mass loss in sdb and sdo atmospheres .",
    "the abundance anomalies observed in the atmospheres of sdb and sdo stars , and their lifetimes , can only be explained when the interaction of both diffusion and mass loss are taken into account ( michaud et al .",
    "1983 , 1985 ; unglaub & bues 1998 for the sdo stars ) .",
    "more detailed spectroscopy and atmospheric modeling in the future will reveal the time dependence and intensity of these winds .",
    "the mass loss rates used for the present study are in the range @xmath18 .",
    "models have been constructed for the metallicity range of @xmath19 and approximately for @xmath20 and 3 .",
    "the isochrones for the hydrogen burning phases that we have used in this paper are the sukyoung yi version of the yale isochrones ( yi , demarque , & oemler 1997b ; available from http://shemesh.gsfc.nasa.gov ) .",
    "the input physics used in these isochrones are somewhat older than the ones used in our hb models , but they are qualitatively compatible to our hb models .",
    "in order to study the possibility of forming blue hb stars through mass loss during the hb phase of stellar evolution , we have constructed evolutionary tracks for hb stars of varying metallicity and envelope mass .",
    "figure 2 shows hb evolutionary tracks and 6 hot stars in ngc6791 whose temperatures and luminosities have been measured by landsman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on their uv fluxes .",
    "the track furthest to the right is the evolutionary track without mass loss and each successive track to the left has a larger mass loss rate ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the effect of mass loss shown in figure 2 is representative of the effects of mass loss in the other models calculated .",
    "several points can be made by examining figure 2 .",
    "first , the greater the mass loss rate assumed , the hotter the star becomes .",
    "this is not a surprising result .",
    "it is generally believed that the hb is a sequence of stars which have the same core mass and varying envelope masses .",
    "the smaller the envelope mass , the hotter the star appears , as a deeper and hotter region is exposed with a smaller envelope .",
    "it seems natural then that mass loss during the hb phase will produce hotter stars with smaller envelopes .    at the same time",
    ", a larger mass loss rate also results in the stars becoming fainter than the stars without mass loss , particularly for the larger mass loss rates .",
    "as our mass loss scheme removes mass from the envelope , which is defined to be the hydrogen burning shell and outwards , the total amount of hydrogen burning is reduced .",
    "this results in the stars evolving with smaller luminosities .",
    "figure 2 shows that the atmospheric properties of the hot stars in ngc6791 ( diamonds ) are well matched by the theoretical models with mass loss if their envelope masses are approximately @xmath24 .",
    "if there is no mass loss on the hb , their properties can be matched only if their envelope masses are as small as @xmath25 ( the filled star symbol at log@xmath26 and logl / l@xmath27 ) . whether hb stars can be born with such low envelope masses at all has been questioned by many groups : `` the minimum envelope mass hypothesis '' ( see the discussion in  3.2 of yi et al .",
    "1997b ) . with mass loss on the hb",
    ", one can match the observed data without violating the minimum envelope mass hypothesis .",
    "it should be noted that the adoption of mass loss on the hb does not change the zero - age hb locus at all in our scenario , because we are only comparing the tracks with and without mass loss when they begin their hb evolution at the same location in the cmd .",
    "the inclusion of mass loss on the hb also contributes to the wide color distribution in the hb of ngc6791 .",
    "figure 3 shows evolutionary tracks for hb stars with varying envelope masses .",
    "each panel is for a given envelope mass with four mass loss rates plotted for each .",
    "the composition for this particular set of models is @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "mass loss has little effect to the evolution of the hb stars with large envelope masses but significantly affects that of less massive stars .",
    "this mass dependency would generate a wider color distribution in the hb .",
    "it may even create a color bimodality ( or multimodality ) , as seen in the hot ends of the hbs of several globular clusters , if the mass dependency is not a smooth function of mass .",
    "this may explain the lack of intermediate hb stars in ngc6791 .",
    "a more detailed modeling will show if this is a plausible explanation to the case of ngc6791 .",
    "the effects of such mass loss in the hb phase have an impact on the study of ultraviolet spectral evolution of old stellar populations as well .",
    "numerical studies by demarque and pinsonneault ( 1988 ) and by horch , demarque , & pinsonneault ( 1992 ) suggested that in the advanced evolution of metal rich hb stars , stars with small envelopes evolve to become uv bright objects , the so - called slow blue phase ( sbp ) stars , rather than evolving into asymptotic giant branch stars ( c.f .",
    "the agb - manqu stars in greggio & renzini 1990 ) .",
    "yi , demarque & kim ( 1997a ) elaborated on the theory and found a theoretical explanation to the sbp phenomenon and to its metallicity dependence , that is , the transitional mass ( the maximum mass of a star that becomes a sbp star ) increasing with metallicity . according to this theory , more metal - rich stars become uv bright sbp stars more easily .    with the additional mass loss on the hb that we consider in this paper",
    ", stars would become sbp stars even more easily .",
    "moreover , if mass loss on the hb increases with increasing metallicity and increasing effective temperature , as various studies suggest , it would cause metal - rich stellar populations to develop uv bright stars more quickly . because sbp stars are considered important uv sources in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , tantalo et al .",
    "1996 ; yi et al . 1997a",
    "; oconnell 1999 ) and the uv flux of elliptical galaxies may constrain the ages of galaxies ( yi et al .",
    "1999 ) , this study has an impact on extragalactic astronomy .",
    "landsman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) already pointed out that a population like ngc6791 would exhibit a uv upturn with the magnitude shown in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "if mass loss on the hb indeed contributes to the production of hot stars in the metal - rich environments , our current age estimates of giant elliptical galaxies are likely to be systematically overestimated .",
    "we should point out that there is no direct observational evidence for mass loss as substantial as we have assumed to occur on the hb .",
    "in fact , besides koopmann et al.s upper limit on the mass loss rate on the hb ( @xmath16 ) , the diffusion study of michaud et al .",
    "( 1985 ) set a more strict upper limit of @xmath30 .",
    "they suggest that if mass loss rate is larger than this it would be difficult to reproduce the silicon underabundance observed in sdb stars",
    ". if this is true , the mass loss rates investigated in our study may be too large to justify , unless mass loss rate increases substantially in the metal - rich regime .",
    "once again , we do not advocate any value or mechanism for the mass loss on the hb . instead",
    ", we wanted to see what level of mass loss rate on the hb would be needed if it is the only process that is responsible for the production of hot hb stars .",
    "based on a cursory inspection of our new hb tracks with mass loss , adoption of such low mass rates ( @xmath31 ) would not make any appreciable difference in the hb morphology .",
    "some of the blue hb stars have been observed to be spectroscopic binaries ( green et al .",
    "this brings up the possibility that the blue hb stars are formed through binary evolution .",
    "some of the formation scenarios such as helium white dwarf mergers ( bailyn & iben 1989 , iben 1990 ) can perhaps be ruled out based on the fact that the luminosities are in a small range ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this small range of the luminosities of the hot stars is also in conflict with the binary scenario ( landsman et al .",
    "mengel , norris , & gross ( 1976 ) demonstrated that blue hb stars can form through binary evolution with mass transfer via roche lobe overflow .",
    "however , the conditions under which this occurs are probably too infrequently met , although further study , applicable to metal rich stellar populations , is needed .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether all blue hb stars in ngc6791 are in mass - exchanging binary systems .",
    "therefore , a mechanism to form blue hb stars through single star evolution is still needed .",
    "mass loss on the hb may be such a mechanism .",
