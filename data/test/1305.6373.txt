    "a series of recent measurements of the emffs has renewed the understanding of the internal structure of the nucleon and has posed fundamental questions about its nonperturbative nature .",
    "the results of the ratio of the proton emffs , @xmath3 with the proton magnetic moment @xmath4 , obtained by measuring the transverse and longitudinal recoil proton polarisations  @xcite , were found to decrease almost linearly as @xmath5 increases for @xmath6 .",

    "this discrepancy is partially explained by the effects of two - photon exchange , which affect unpolarised electron - proton scattering at higher @xmath5 but have less influence on the polarisation measurements  @xcite .",

    "however , the experimental data show that the ratio @xmath11 increases with @xmath5 but @xmath12 becomes flat starting around @xmath13 .",

    "we also reexamine the results of the strange emffs , since there are new experimental data from pv polarised electron - nucleon scattering . in particular , the g0 collaboration recently measured the paritiy - violating asymmetries in the backward angle  @xcite , which was first predicted in ref .  @xcite .",

    "this comes from the fact that the neutron anomalous magnetic moment is negative , which yields an induced electric dipole moment along the positive @xmath145 axis , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is very instructive to examine the transverse charge densities inside the transversely polarised nucleon for each flavour , since they reveal the inner structure of the nucleon more in detail .",
    "figure  [ fig : flvtcdpol ] illustrates them . the up transverse charge density inside the transversely polarised nucleon ,",
    "@xmath155 is shown to be shifted to the negative direction , while that for the down quark is more distorted upwards .",
    "it is natural , since the up and down quarks have positive and negative charges , respectively .",
    "however , it is remarkable to see that the down quark is influenced more strongly due to the transverse polarisation of the nucleon .",
    "the @xmath156 is even more interesting . as discussed previously , the strange anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath157 , which would induce the negative electric dipole moment along the negative @xmath158 .",
    "however , situation turns out to be more complicated . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flvtcdpol ] , the @xmath159 is shifted to the positive @xmath158 and turns negative starting from @xmath160 . in order to understand this surprising result",
    ", we need to reexamine the transverse magnetisation density for the strange quark , which has been presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : flvtcds ] .",
    "the strange magnetisation density is negative in the inner part of the nucleon and then it becomes positive from @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the electric dipole moment is correspondingly induced along the positive @xmath145 direction in the centred region , and then it becomes negative from @xmath162 , as drawn in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flvtcdpol ] .",
    "in the present work , we aimed at investigating the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon , based on the su(2 ) and su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model with a symmetry - preserving quantisation employed .",
    "we considered the rotational @xmath1 corrections and the first - order @xmath2 corrections .",
    "we first presented the results of the ratio of the magnetic form factor to the electric form factor of the proton .",
    "it was shown that the results from the su(2 ) chiral quark - soliton model described the experimental data very well , whereas those of su(3 ) seemed slightly underestimated in higher @xmath5 .",
    "the general tendency of the present results were in greement with the experimental data .",
    "as for the neutron , the su(3 ) results turned out to be rather different from those in su(2 ) , which arose from the strange quark contribution to the neutron electric form factor .",
    "in particular , the neutron electric form factor is rather sensitive to the tail of the soliton .",
    "we then discussed that the up and the down electric form factors normalised by the dipole parametrisation were well reproduced in comparison with the data .",
    "as for the magnetic form factors , they deviate from the experimental data as @xmath5 increases but the general behaviour of the form factors are in line with the experimental data , which indicates that the @xmath5 dependence are well explained .",
    "we presented the prediction of the strange form factors normalised by the dipole form factor .",
    "the dirac and pauli form factors were predicted to be asymptotically proportional to @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively in perturbative qcd .",
    "thus , @xmath163 and @xmath164 were measured experimentally to examine their @xmath5 dependence .",
    "we found that the present su(2 ) model explained well @xmath165 whereas the result from the su(3 ) model becomes underestimated in higher @xmath5 .",
    "both the su(2 ) and su(3 ) results for @xmath166 described the experimental data very well . on the other hand , the su(2 ) result for @xmath167 is in conflict with the data but that from the su(3 ) model is in agreement with the data except for the higher @xmath5 region . again",
    "this discrepancy can be understood by the sensitivity of the neutron electric form factor to the soliton tail .",
    "the results for the flavour - decomposed @xmath163 and @xmath164 were shown to be in general in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "having performed the two - dimensional fourier transform of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors , we were able to produce the charge densities in the transverse plane inside a proton .",
    "as expected , both the su(2 ) and the su(3 ) transverse charge densities were positive in the proton .",
    "however , as for the neutron case , the result from the su(2 ) was opposite to that from the su(3 ) : the negative charge was located in the centre of the neutron while the positive one was distributed in outer part within the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model , it was other way around in the su(2 ) model .",
    "the explanation comes from the decomposed - flavour transverse charge densities in the su(3 ) model .",
    "in particular , the component of the strange quark played an essential role in spite of the smallness of its magnitude .",
    "since the up quark component mainly contributed to the transverse charge density inside a proton , the strange transverse charge density was almost negligible . on the other hand , the up and the down quark contributions were nearly cancelled out in such a way that the negative charge remained in the centre of the neutron with small magnitude . then the contribution of the strange quark came into play , so that the transverse charge densities inside a neutron finally became negative in the centre .",
    "when the proton was polarised along the positive @xmath148 direction , the corresponding transverse charge density was shifted to the negative @xmath145 direction , which indicated that the electric dipole moment was induced along the negative @xmath145 direction .",
    "it is just a well - known relativistic effect in electrodynamics . in the case of the neutron polarised along the @xmath148 axis",
    ", the negative charge was moved to the negative @xmath145 direction but the positive one was forced to the positive @xmath145 axis .",
    "it implies that the neutron anomalous magnetic moment is negative , which induces an electric dipole moment along the positive @xmath145 axis .",
    "we also decomposed the transverse charge densities inside the polarised nucleon for each flavour : the up transverse charge density for the nucleon transversely polarised along the positive @xmath148 axis was found to be shifted to the negative direction , while that of the down quark was more distorted upwards .",
    "since the up and down quarks have positive and negative charges , respectively , one can easily understand these features .",
    "however , the down quark was found to be affected more strongly due to the transverse polarisation of the nucleon .",
    "the strange charge density inside the transversely polarised nucleon was shifted to the positive @xmath158 and turned out to be negative in the outer region .",
    "this unexpected behavior of the strange charge density for the transversely polarised nucleon was explained in terms of the strange magnetisation density .",
    "since the transverse charge densities inside unpolarised and polarised nucleons pave the novel way for understanding the internal structure of the nucleon , it is interesting to investigate them for other baryons such as the @xmath168 isobar and hyperons .",
    "the transverse charge densities are directly connected to the generalized parton distributions of which the integrations over parton momentum fractions yield form factors and consequently the spatial distribution of partons in the transverse plane .",
    "moreover , the transverse charge densities for transition form factors provide a new aspect of understanding the inner structure of the baryons .",
    "for example , as ref .",
    "@xcite already studied , they exhibit explicitly multipole structures of the transitions in the transverse plane .",
    "thus , it is of great importance to examine the transverse charge densities for other baryons and for their transitions .",
    "corresponding investigations are under way .",
