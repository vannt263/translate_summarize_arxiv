    "it has long been suggested that , due to the screening of the heavy quark potential , the yield of heavy quarkonia is suppressed in heavy - ion collisions compared to expectations from p+p collisions .",
    "charmonium suppression was , in fact , anticipated as a key signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is expected that quarkonium states follow a sequential suppression pattern , where states with lower binding energies dissociate ( `` melt '' ) at lower temperatures than states with higher binding energies , thus quarkonium measurements may serve as a thermometer of the medium  @xcite . despite early expectations",
    ", it has been found that the energy dependence of @xmath7 suppression is rather weak from sps to top rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "an explanation to this is that later recombination ( coalescence ) of @xmath8 pairs gives a sizeable contribution to the @xmath9yield which compensates for melting .",
    "moreover , d+au measurements proved that the cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects also play an important role  @xcite .",
    "feed - down from heavier states such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons to @xmath9also contribute to the measured yields .",
    "bottomonia are expected to be less affected by many of these effects than charmonia , as co - mover absorbtion and recombination are predicted to be negligible at rhic energies  @xcite . therefore it provides a cleaner probe for qgp effects .",
    "nevertheless , feed - down such as @xmath13 , @xmath1(2s ) and @xmath1(3s ) decaying to @xmath1(1s ) is still present in the case of bottomonia .",
    "the star experiment at rhic comprises several subsystems that provide full azimuthal coverage at mid - rapidity ( @xmath14@xmath151 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the star detector can be found in ref .",
    "the current measurements reconstruct @xmath1states through the dielectron decay channel .",
    "we quantify the modification of @xmath1production in the nuclear matter produced in a+a collisions with the nuclear modification factor , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total inelastic cross section of the a+a ( p+p ) collisions , @xmath18 denotes the @xmath1production cross section in a+a ( p+p ) collisions , and @xmath19 is the branching ratio of the @xmath20 processes .",
    "a similarly defined @xmath21is used for describing nuclear modification in d+au collisions .",
    "measurements in p+p collisions are essential not only as a baseline for nuclear modification , but also as a benchmark for theoretical calculations .",

    "[ fig : stardauraa ] shows the @xmath21versus rapidity measured by star and phenix  @xcite .",

    "interestingly , star measurements show a strongly suppressed @xmath1production at mid - rapidity ( @xmath23 ) , although the uncertainties are relatively high  @xcite .",
    "this is a warning that cnm effects may also play an important role in nucleus - nucleus collisions , or that hot nuclear matter effects may also be present in d(p)+au collisions .",

    "in the followings we summarize star bottomonium measurements in au+au collisions at @xmath22 gev  @xcite as well as preliminary results in u+u collisions at @xmath26 gev .",
    "events of heavy - ion collisions were selected based on a `` high tower '' trigger that fired in each event where an energetic hit ( approximately 4.2 gev depending on the particular tower ) was present in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) .",
    "a total of 1.08 nb@xmath3 integrated luminosity was used in the case of au+au collisons , and 263.4 @xmath2b @xmath3 in the u+u measurement .",

    "further electron identification was applied using the bemc .",
    "the position of the reconstructed tracks were extrapolated towards the bemc surface and matched to hits in bemc towers .",
    "three adjacent towers around a bemc hit that contained the highest energy deposits were combined into clusters in order to get a better estimate of the total energy deposit .",
    "electron candidates were then required to have a cluster energy close to its momentum . since electromagnetic showers are generally compact , most of the cluster energy was required to be in a single tower .",
    "the particular cut values differ in the two analyses ; because of the scarcity of statistics in the u+u case , tighter cuts had to be applied in order to reduce the background .",

    "the precision of current measurements in the dielectron channel are limited by the low statistics of the heavy - ion and the reference samples .",
    "ongoing analysis of the high - statistics @xmath25=200 gev au+au dataset , taken in 2014 with the recently inaugurated mtd detector , will strongly reduce both the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
