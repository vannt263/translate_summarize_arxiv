    "the short reset - time , low jitter , and broad wavelength response of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) makes them attractive candidates to replace other single photon detectors , including avalanche photodiodes @xcite , in applications such as free - space optical communications @xcite , quantum cryptography networks @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite . to fully take advantage of the boost in speed afforded by these properties , snspds with high system detection efficiencies ( @xmath1 )",
    "are needed .",
    "but snspds typically exhibit @xmath1s of only 0.2 - 10% for 1.55-@xmath0m - wavelength single - photons @xcite .",
    "this limitation is currently believed to be due to poor coupling efficiency ( @xmath2 ) ; however , this may not be the entire story . to understand where the losses come from",
    ", we need to examine the factors that contribute to the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 is a product of two lumped quantities , the coupling efficiency ( @xmath2 ) and the device detection efficiency ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 encapsulates all loss mechanisms encountered between the photon source and snspd , and is defined as the ratio of the number of photons that reach the active area to the number of photons emitted by the photon source .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to realize @xmath4 through careful optical design that minimizes these losses . on the other hand ,",
    "maximizing @xmath3 is not as simple .",
    "the @xmath3 is the probability that a photon incident on the active area results in a voltage pulse .",
    "@xmath3 depends on two quantities , the absorptance @xmath5 , and the probability of resistive state formation due to an absorption event @xmath6 through @xmath7 while @xmath6 depends on the microscopic physics of the nanowires , @xmath5 depends only on the optical properties of our fabricated structures and the incident field .",
    "@xmath5 needs to be maximized to make efficient detectors ; however , there are many ways an incident photon can remain unabsorbed . for example",
    ", the photon can pass through open gaps between the nanowires or be transmitted through the subwavelength thickness of nbn .",
    "in addition , a low value for @xmath6 will further suppress @xmath3 ( and therefore also @xmath1 ) .    in this paper , we experimentally demonstrate that the optical polarization and changes in the geometry ( pitch and fill - factor ) of snspds impact their absorptance and efficiency .",
    "for example , for devices with 200 nm pitch and 50% fill factor , we found that 21% of light incident from the front was absorbed for parallel polarization , while only 10% was absorbed for perpendicular polarization .",
    "the absorptance was reduced to 14% and 6% for parallel and perpendicular polarizations , respectively , for devices with the same pitch but a 25% fill - factor .",
    "we describe both a numerical model that predicts the absorptance of our structures , and experiments that directly measure absorptance .",
    "we found that the experimental data matches the predictions of our model to within the uncertainties in our knowledge of physical and optical parameters .",
    "we also measured the @xmath3 for the same devices and compared it to the measured absorptance .",
    "we discovered , remarkably , that @xmath6 is different for photons polarized perpendicular ( @xmath8 ) to the nanowires ( @xmath9 ) than for photons polarized parallel to the nanowires ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we propose a model that qualitatively explains our observation of @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we also made measurements to confirm that our numerical model and modeling parameters are accurate over a range of wavelengths .",
    "we measured the factor of enhancement of @xmath3 due to the addition of an integrated optical cavity for single - photon wavelengths of 700 - 1700 nm , and found good agreement with our numerical model .",
    "as a result , we have shown that optical modelling can be used to design future snspds in new regimes of operation .",

    ", we will describe the setup and experiments conducted to measure absorptance on our devices . in section [ sec.wavelength ] , we will describe the experiments conducted to measure the wavelength dependence of the enhancement due to the addition of an optical cavity .",
    "we will not describe fabrication details or @xmath3 measurement details as these were discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we modeled the absorption process of photons by an snspd as a plane wave interacting with an infinite grating .",
    "these two approximations are justified because in our experiments , the photon was launched at normal incidence and had plane - wave phase - fronts when it reached the detectors , and because our beam spot was smaller than the test grating which will be described in section [ sec.expt ] .",
    "while analytic methods , such as form birefringence theory , have been used in the past to analyze grating structures such as wire - grid polarizers @xcite , they break down for subwavelength grating thicknesses , in particular for electric - field polarized perpendicular to the wires in the grating ( i.e. in the direction of grating periodicity ) can be obtained with the fresnel equations where an effective index @xmath12 is used for the thin film consisting of nbn subwavelength gratings ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the fill - factor ) . a simple effective index model that only depends on @xmath15 will not work for perpendicular polarization since @xmath16 depends on both @xmath15 and @xmath17 . ] @xcite .",

    "this effect is observed because there are more air - nbn interfaces per unit area for a grating with a smaller pitch than one with a larger pitch , and the boundary conditions dictate a lower @xmath53 in the nbn at each air - nbn interface .",
    "the plots also illustrate an important limitation that @xmath5 poses to the photon detection process : the maximum @xmath5 ( and therefore also @xmath3 ) can not exceed 30% with the configuration shown .",
    "there are two ways that @xmath5 can be increased that have already been demonstrated : ( 1 ) by using back - illumination ( i.e. through sapphire edge @xmath54 ) instead of front - illumination ( i.e. through air edge @xmath55 ) , and thereby reducing the index mismatch with nbn , @xmath5 can be increased up to 45% ; ( 2 ) by fabricating an optical cavity designed to intensify the field in the nbn nanowires @xcite .",

    "the stage could be affixed to a cryostat specially designed to allow free - space optical coupling to a cold sample , or be used without a cryostat for room - temperature measurements .",
    "we mounted a single - mode optical fiber ( corning smf-28 ) to the stage that was illuminated by a 1.55-@xmath0m - wavelength diode laser ( thorlabs s1fc1550 ) and polarized using a state of polarization ( sop ) locker ( thorlabs pl100s ) .",
    "the sop locker was preferable to a manual polarizer because it provided mechanical isolation to our setup when we varied polarization and permitted automation of the data acquisition process .",
    "the polarized light was collimated and split equally into two arms . in one arm , a ge - based sensor ( thorlabs s122a ) connected to a power meter ( thorlabs pm100 ) was used to measure the incident light intensity , mainly for troubleshooting purposes . in the other arm , a long - working - distance microscope objective ( mitutoyo m plan",

    "the absorptance was calculated from these measurements and earlier calibrations discussed in the main text . ]",
    "it was necessary to fabricate devices which were specially designed to facilitate both absorptance and @xmath3 measurements .",
    "a typical device is pictured in figure [ fig.sems ] where the active area ( @xmath57 ) of the snspd is centrally located within a large grating structure ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the small active area facilitated @xmath3 measurements because it enabled better uniformity in electrical response across the device .",
    "the larger grating structure , which has the same @xmath17 and @xmath15 as the smaller active area , facilitated measurements of @xmath5 because it closely matched our simulation geometry.m fwhm laser spot was incident on the large grating structure .",

    "the procedure for collecting absorptance data was as follows .",
    "we first measured the reflected and transmitted power from gold and sapphire in the vicinity of the device .",
    "these measurements were repeated over polarizations spaced by 10@xmath65 on the poincar sphere .",
    "we calibrated the measured reflected and transmitted power to the theoretical reflectance and transmittance @xmath66 of gold @xmath67 and sapphire @xmath68 calculated from their refractive index values at @xmath69 .",
    "we then measured the reflected and transmitted power with the laser centered in the active area of the snspd , and calculated @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "we then repeated our measurements on 10 - 13 identical devices in each of the five groups of devices .",
    "figure [ fig.a - vs - device - type ] shows our measurements of @xmath50 and @xmath16 at room temperature .",
    "room temperature measurements did not differ significantly from measurements of @xmath5 made at 6 k. we attempted to fit the model by using @xmath27 and @xmath23 as free parameters , and assuming @xmath23 was between and .",
    "our fit required wire widths that were systematically 10 - 15% larger than the nominal @xmath27 used in our electron - beam - lithography pattern .",
    "there are many uncertainties in our model parameters that can contribute to this .",
    "one cause is that we may have inadvertently exposed the resist adjacent to the intended structure causing @xmath27 to be larger than desired .",
    "we conducted scanning electron microscopy of our nanowires and found that @xmath27 predicted by the model were within the uncertainty caused by increased secondary electron emission from the edges of the nanowires .",
    "however , there are other factors that can contribute to a fitting error .",
    "one factor is that the nbn refractive index we used in our simulations may not be accurate because the refractive index was measured on a thicker film ( 12 nm ) than the film we used to fabricated our devices on ( 4 - 6 nm ) .",
    "in addition , the films were from different growth batches so may have had slight differences in optical properties .",

    "a comparison of device detection efficiency to absorptance can answer one important question about our device : is every absorbed photon actually detected ? to answer this question , we measured both @xmath3 ( using the measurement apparatus described in @xcite but with front - illumination instead of back - illumination ) and @xmath5 for the same devices .",

    "there are two remarkable features in the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.snspd-testing-de-vs-a ] .",
    "first , @xmath6 had a peak value of 0.85@xmath75 for parallel polarization .",
    "the natural question one can ask is what happens to absorbed photons that do not lead to detection events ?",
    "one possible explanation is that the devices were in some way not biased at their `` true '' critical currents , i.e. that they were constricted in some way so that the absorption of photons does not cause a voltage pulse .",
    "another explanation is that there is some other absorbing medium that was not accounted for .",
    "we aim to address this issue in future experiments .    a second remarkable feature of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig.snspd-testing-de-vs-a ] is that @xmath6 for parallel polarization ( @xmath76 ) is different than @xmath6 for perpendicular polarization ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "while we do not yet completely understand the origin of the disparity between @xmath10 and @xmath9 , we have developed a model that can form a starting point for further analysis .",
    "the main assumption of this model is a position - dependent ( but polarization - independent ) probability _ density _ of resistive state formation , @xmath78 , where @xmath20 is the distance across the nanowire .",
    "the second element of this model is the time - averaged resistive dissipation @xmath79 which we know to be both position - dependent and polarization - dependent .",
    "these two elements can be combined to give the device detection efficiency and absorptance for parallel and perpendicular polarization : @xmath80 we can use this equation , eq .  , and a calculated @xmath79 to find a @xmath78 that gives a different @xmath6 for parallel and perpendicular polarizations . using our data , we found that @xmath78 needs to be larger at the edges of the nanowire than in the center to explain @xmath81 , however the five geometries we investigated did not provide enough resolution to fit @xmath78 to a specific shape at this point .",
    "in the previous section , we verified that our model predicted the absorptance for our structures to within experimental uncertainties . but this verification was done only at a single wavelength of 1550 nm , mainly because all of our optical components , i.e. , the laser , fiber , lenses , sop locker , microscope objective , beam splitter , collimator , and photodiodes were optimized for that wavelength .",
    "in order to verify our modeling parameters for a range of wavelengths , we measured the cavity enhancement factor @xmath82 for snspds over a range of wavelengths .",
    "the cavity enhancement factor @xmath82 is the ratio of the absorptance of an snspd with an integrated cavity to the absorptance without a cavity and depends on the refractive indices of the materials and the geometry .",
    "@xmath82 is also the factor by which the intensity of the electric field in nbn , and therefore @xmath79 , is increased due to the presence of a cavity . in view of eq .  , and because @xmath78 should not depend on the intensity , we can determine @xmath82 by measuring @xmath3 for an snspd with a cavity and the @xmath3 of an snspd without a cavity and taking the ratio of these two quantities for each wavelength .",
    "we generated radiation spanning the range from 600 - 1700 nm using a supercontinuum source ( toptica photonics ) .",
    "this source consisted of a power - amplified , modelocked fiber laser with 100 fs pulses at 1550 nm , which could either be coupled into a highly - nonlinear step - index fiber ( generating a frequency comb from @xmath83600 - 1050 nm ) or first doubled using a periodically - poled lithium - niobate crystal and then coupled into a photonic crystal fiber ( blazed photonics ) ( generating a frequency comb from @xmath83 1150 - 1700 nm ) .",
    "we used a pellin - broca prism to select a wavelength band out of one or the other of these outputs ( with a fwhm @xmath84 ) which we then coupled into an optical fiber ( smf-28 , single mode from @xmath831200 - 1600 nm ) .",
    "the wavelength of the light output from the fiber could then be tuned by rotating the prism .",
    "we used this tunable output to measure the enhancement @xmath82 . the most obvious way to do this",
    "would simply be to make calibrated @xmath3 measurements at all wavelengths before and after adding the cavity .",
    "however , we chose not to attempt this , since we had no way to accurately calibrate optical power levels at or near the single - photon level over such a wide wavelength range . to avoid the need for this calibration , we instead measured only detection efficiency ratios for pairs of detectors side - by - side . to do this , we fabricated a chip with 225 pairs of 3@xmath853.3 @xmath0 m detectors , where the two in each pair could be read out separately , and were spaced by only 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "we measured critical currents and room - temperature resistances of all 450 detectors , and identified @xmath83 50 pairs for which these values were within 5% of each other .",
    "we then measured ( calibrated ) @xmath3s at 1550 nm for this subset of detectors , and further narrowed the experimental sample to the pairs having @xmath3s within 5% of each other .",
    "then , we added optical cavities to one detector of each pair , and re - measured at 1550 nm .",
    "although we commonly observe that @xmath3 for a given device can vary between cooldowns ( particularly if some additional processing has occurred ) , these variations are nearly always strongly correlated with a variation of the critical current ( a reduced @xmath3 correlates with a reduced critical current ) .",
    "so , we selected from our pairs of detectors only those where the critical currents remained the same to within 5% after the addition of cavities , and where the detector which did not have a cavity added had the same @xmath3 as previously to within 5% .",
    "lastly , we further reduced our experimental sample by selecting only the subset of devices which were relatively unconstricted @xcite . in the present context , this corresponded to those devices with @xmath3 at 1550 nm @xmath8617% for front illumination .",
    "our final sample consisted of five detector pairs .",
    "for these ten detectors , we measured count rates at each of a sequence of wavelengths spanning the entire accessible range . by measuring both detectors in a pair in succession without adjusting the source in any way",
    ", we ensured that the optical power incident on the two detectors was identical , and therefore that their count rates could be compared directly to give @xmath82 .",
    "this precaution was important since the optical power obtainable in a given wavelength band was not repeatable , nor was the coupling into the smf-28 optical fiber , which was not single - mode over a fraction of our wavelength range . given the latter issue , we restricted ourselves to the wavelength range 700 - 1700 nm where the fiber output could be fairly well polarized ( extinction ratio @xmath86 20 ) .",
    "figure [ fig.snspd-testing-de-vs-wavelength ] shows the enhancement measured in this manner , and a calculation of @xmath82 as a function of wavelength .",
