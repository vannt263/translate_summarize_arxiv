    "progressive improvements of detectors since the pioneering efforts in the 1960s have led to improved measurements of the spectrum of the electronic component and positron fraction by the fermi , hess , atic , and pamela instruments [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "these measurements have stimulated great excitement , not only because of their importance to cosmic ray studies , but also because of the possible interpretation of some of the features from signals from the annihilation of dark matter in the galaxy .",
    "we reproduce the observed total electronic spectrum @xmath1 and the positron fraction @xmath2 in fig . [ hess ] and fig .",
    "[ pam ] respectively .    in section",
    "ii , we show that these observations help us in distinguishing between the leaky box @xcite and the nested leaky box models @xcite .",
    "it is the difference in the kinematics of the reactions producing secondary ` light ' nuclei and positrons that helps in distinguishing amongst these models .",
    "we show that the positron fraction observed by pamela may be fit well with the nested leaky box model .",
    "we begin section iii by deriving the spectrum of electrons resulting from direct acceleration in the cosmic ray sources by subtracting the secondary electrons and positrons from the spectrum of the total electronic component . after this , the rest of the section is devoted to a discussion of this primary electron spectrum in terms of a set of discrete sources of cosmic rays sprinkled throughout the galaxy .",
    "the analysis indicates that we need the closest source to be no more than @xmath3 200 pc from the solar system , which in turn implies that there are about 5000 sources accelerating cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "the contrast between the spectra expected from a discrete set of sources and from sources spatially distributed smoothly throughout the galaxy plays an important role in analyzing signatures from the annihilation of dark matter in the galaxy .",
    "this aspect is discussed in section iv .",
    "it would be appropriate to note here that the theoretical considerations of cosmic ray transport with exponential pathlength distributions @xcite@xcite and its analysis in terms of a set of discrete sources sprinkled over the galaxy @xcite@xcite started three or four decades ago .",
    "the recent improved measurements constitute a testing ground for these early ideas on cosmic ray physics .     and @xmath4.,width=240 ]     gev.,width=240 ]",
    "the observations of decreasing ratios of secondaries to primaries like b / c and ( v+ti+sc)/fe with increasing energy per nucleon in cosmic rays could be incorporated into the original leaky box model ( a and b ) @xcite by letting the mean residence time @xmath5 depend on energy in such a way as to reproduce the observations @xcite .",
    "a viable alternative to this idea was the nested leaky box model ( c ) @xcite in which the energy dependant part of the ratio ( proportional to @xmath6 ) was attributed to the spallation in the matter constrained in a cocoon - like region surrounding the sources and the resident time in the galaxy @xmath7 was assumed independent of energy . with observations of the ratios limited to a finite range of energies , it became customary to extrapolate the residence times as a simple power law , decreasing as @xmath8 .",
    "even though the observations to date allow @xmath9 beyond some tens of gev / n , this alternative had not been discussed earlier .",
    "these three possibilities and their corresponding fit to the secondary to primary ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ bc ] for the b / c ratio .",
    "the ( v+ti+sc)/fe ratio can be fit similarly .",
    "the three models presented here are characterized by mean residence times as noted below : .",

    "/ n^-1.when spallation and energy loss during transport could be neglected , the three models led to the following equilibrium spectra of cosmic rays in the galaxy : [ eq : f ]    ll  f_a&~q_0_0e^-(+ ) +  f_b&~q_0_0e^-(+ ) ,  e10  gev   + & ~q_0_ge^- ,  e10  gev +  f_c&~q_0_ge^- .    note that @xmath11 does not depend upon @xmath6 @xcite .    unless @xmath12 itself is a function of energy so that eq .",
    "5b reproduces the observed spectra of the nuclear component that is a simple power law , model b is not viable .",
    "model a requires @xmath13 and predicts increasing anisotropy with energy of cosmic rays , and model c requires @xmath14 and generates constant anisotropy at all energies .",
    "the observations of the positron fraction provides a clear way of choosing amongst these three models .",
    "the reason for this is related to the fact that in the spallation process that generates the secondary cosmic ray nuclei like b in collisions of the primary c nuclei , the daughter nuclei will emerge with the same energy per nucleon as the parents . on the other hand",
    ", the production of positrons proceeds through the production of mesons ( mainly pions ) in the collision of the primary nuclei which follow the decay chain @xmath15 , followed by @xmath16 . in this process ,",
    "the positrons and the secondary electrons carry , on the average , only a small fraction @xmath17 of the energy / nucleon of the primary . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the production spectrum of positrons ( and secondary electrons ) in all the three models are nearly identical .",
    "the fact that low energy cosmic rays spend more time in the cocoon surrounding the sources plays no role as the @xmath18 and @xmath19 secondaries are generated only by the high energy part of the nucleon spectrum .",
    "now the equilibrium spectrum of secondary @xmath18 and @xmath19 predicted by the three models simply follow the product of the production rate , @xmath20 and the residence time @xmath21 at low energies . at very high energies ,",
    "all the models predict steeper spectra @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is defined in eq .",

    "is taken to be the smooth fit to the data shown in fig .",
    "note that only model c provides a good fit over the entire range of the pamela observations .",
    "thus , the observed positron fraction resolves the degeneracy amongst models developed to understand the nuclear secondaries and suggests that the nested leaky box model may provide a closer approximation to cosmic ray transport in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the nucleonic component in the primary cosmic rays consists mainly of protons with a small fraction of neutrons which come in bound to he and other nuclei . as a consequence , the production of positrons",
    "is favored over that of electrons in cosmic ray secondaries : q_n-(e)/q_n+(e)0.5 - 0.8.the lower value of @xmath27 is favored by the theoretical estimates based on the data on nuclear interactions obtained at accelerators @xcite , and the larger value is favored by the observations of the @xmath28 ratio generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere @xcite . the loss of energy by energetic cosmic ray electrons due to inverse compton scattering and synchrotron emission in the magnetic fields prevalent in the propagation volume is given by de / dt =- be^2;@xmath29 noting that the scattering of starlight by the very high energy electrons is described by the klein - nishina formula , the effect of starlight may be neglected , and only the microwave background contributes to @xmath30 in eq . 10 . taking @xmath31 and @xmath32",
