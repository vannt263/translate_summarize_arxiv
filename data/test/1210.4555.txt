    "the alternating current effect is a consequence of an existence of different lme symmetries for even and odd number of sites ( [ symmetryeven ] ) , ( [ symmetryodd ] ) and as such is quite general . indeed",
    "the derivation of ( [ j_even]),([j_odd ] ) does not depend neither on coupling @xmath50 now on gradients @xmath49 and @xmath96 as given by ( [ lindbladoperators ] ) .",
    "also , the phenomenon of alternating current does not rely on an integrability of the @xmath0 model .",
    "indeed , an addition of a staggered anisotropy to the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) breaks integrability but the eqs .",
    "( [ symmetryeven ] ) , ( [ symmetryodd ] ) remain valid . moreover , even though our conclusion relied on the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ j_even ] ) , ( [ j_odd ] ) , the alternating current was also observed in a recent study of a driven @xmath0 chain with an @xmath2 boundary setup different from ( [ lindbladoperators ] ) , where one of two symmetries ( eq([j_even ] ) ) was absent @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the magnetization current sign alternation resulting from applying transverse gradients can be a rather general phenomenon , which might be observable under appropriate experimental conditions in artificially assembled nanomagnets consisting of just a few  atoms @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the current sign alteration is that the spin current _ can not be ballistic_. indeed , for large @xmath16 we should not be able to differentiate between even and odd @xmath16 , so that the stationary magnetization current @xmath58 must vanish in the thermodynamic limit:@xmath97    this conclusion is a rather unexpected one , since in the @xmath0 integrable system , in the critical region @xmath4 one usually expects a ballistic current @xcite .",
    "the magnetization current is also ballistic @xmath4 for reservoirs creating boundary gradients along the anisotropy axis @xcite .    up to now",
    "we did not make use of the symmetry ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) .",
    "in fact , it does not impose any further restrictions for spin current , while the energy current changes its sign under the symmetry ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) and must therefore vanish @xmath98 consequently , the energy and spin currents decouple : the spin current can flow , while the energy current is totally suppressed ( [ j_heat ] ) . vanishing of the energy current is a consequence of a symmetric choice @xmath99 ( [ symmetryu - uprime ] ) , and will be lifted if @xmath100",
    ".    * remark*. note that if both boundary reservoirs were aligning boundary spins along the same direction in @xmath2-plane , the magnetization current will be completely suppressed for all @xmath3 , despite the existence of boundary gradients .",
    "e.g. for a choice of the set of lindblad operators @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 in ( [ lindbladaction ] ) , which favours the alignment of the boundary spins along the @xmath9 axis , the current suppression follows from a symmetry @xmath104 of the ness , since @xmath105 .",
    "thus , our choice ( [ lindbladaction ] ) is the minimal nontrivial one , to observe a nonzero magnetization current .    in the following we check our findings and analyze the model further by computing exact ness numerically for finite @xmath50 and analytically for @xmath106 using a perturbative expansion .",

    "numerically , we observe @xmath263 for other @xmath3 values as well .",
    "generically , we find the current amplitude to be a smooth function of @xmath50 for a fixed value of the anisotropy @xmath3 . for large couplings",
    ", it asymptotically approaches its limiting value @xmath221 at @xmath200 .",
    "interestingly , the magnetization current is not suppressed for large couplings @xmath50 , as it happens for @xmath6-polarized lindblad baths @xcite,@xcite due to a quantum zeno effect .",
    "indeed for our choice of the bath ( [ lindbladoperators ] ) and large coupling , the quantum zeno effect `` freezes '' @xmath267 and @xmath268 spin components at the boundaries , while hoppings in the @xmath69 component , contributing to the magnetization current , may still occur .",
    "finally , we investigated the current dependence on the boundary gradient @xmath49 , which can be manipulated by a choice of the amplitudes of the lindblad operators in ( [ lindbladoperators ] ) . by fourier law , we may expect the current to be proportional to @xmath49 , for small gradients @xmath49 , and introduce a conductivity tensor @xmath269 as a proportionality coefficient between the current @xmath270 and the infinitesimal boundary gradient @xmath271 in the spin component @xmath272 , @xmath273 .",

    "finally , note that our model shows a behaviour fundamentally different from that with usually considered boundary driving along the @xmath6-axis , referred to below as a `` scalar '' setup .",
    "just to mention two crucial differences : the scalar setup leads to a ballistic current in the critical gapless region of the @xmath0 model @xmath278 @xcite , while in the @xmath2-driven chain the alternating signs phenomenon ( [ symmetryeven]-[currentsignalternation ] ) rules out the possibility of a ballistic current . in the `` scalar '' setup the current at strong coupling",
    "is suppressed due to a zeno effect , @xmath279 , while in the @xmath2-driven chain of finite size the spin current in the limit @xmath106 remains finite .",
    "we considered an open @xmath0 spin 1/2 chain with a twisting in @xmath2- plane , imposed by boundary gradients .",
    "symmetries of the lindblad equation were found which impose drastic restrictions on the steady state reduced density matrix , and various observables . for our boundary setup the ness energy current vanishes , and the magnetization current alternates its sign with system size , which rules out the possibility of a ballistic current .",
    "we argued that the current sign alternation under trasverse gradients is a robust phenomenon in quantum transport which does not rely on integrability .",
    "the qualitative difference in quantum transport in even- and odd - sized systems adds to a list of similar phenomena observed in quantum diffusion in periodic chains @xcite . to support our findings",
    ", we constructed a nonequilibrium steady state solution of the lindblad master equation in the form of a perturbative expansion in orders of @xmath45 , and calculated the zeroth - order term analytically for small system sizes , by solving a set of linear equations which guarantee the self - consistency of the expansion , the secular conditions ( [ secularconditions ] ) . we find that , for @xmath147 , the current remains finite even in the limit of infinitely strong effective coupling .",
    "further on , for large couplings we find a nontrivial dependence of the magnetization current on the anysotropy @xmath95 , and observed sharp peaks in @xmath95 inside the critical gapless region of the @xmath0 model @xmath278 , the origin of which was attributed to an appearance of higher fourier harmonics in magnetization profiles .",
    "we observe an anomalous flattening of the current near @xmath80 point for odd @xmath16 and noncommutativity of limits @xmath205 and @xmath204 for even @xmath16 . for weak driving @xmath52 and small system sizes , we find @xmath275 for all values of @xmath3 , signalizing subdiffusive current in the direction trasverse to @xmath2 boundary gradients .",
