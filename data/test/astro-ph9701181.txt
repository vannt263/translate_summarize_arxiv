    "the discovery of @xmath0al in the interstellar medium by the heao-3 satellite , through the detection of the 1809 kev @xmath2-ray line ( @xcite , @xcite ) , has raised the interest on potential @xmath2-ray diagnostics of nucleosynthesis in several scenarios .",
    "this @xmath2-ray line is produced by the decay ( @xmath3 years ) from the ground state of @xmath0al to the first excited state of @xmath0 mg , which de - excites to its ground state level by emitting a 1809 kev photon .",
    "this detection has been confirmed by other space missions like the smm @xmath2-ray spectrometer ( @xcite ) or several balloon - borne experiments .",
    "recent measurements made with the comptel instrument on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) have provided a map of the 1809 kev emission in the galaxy .",
    "this map shows an extended diffuse emission along the galactic plane , with a peculiar large scale asymmetry about the galactic center and a clumpy structure with several noticeable hot spots ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first interpretations of this map have suggested that novae and low  mass stars can not be the major contributors to the 1809 kev emission , because their low individual yields and their high frequency should provide a smooth distribution , in contradiction with the irregular appearance of the emission ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the general model suggested considers a two - component origin of the emission : a global component following the spiral pattern of the galaxy ( a presumed site of massive star formation ) on which several localized regions of intense activity , such as the vela region , are superimposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , observations of four nearby supernova remnants with comptel do not provide evidence for the 1809 kev emission , although the uncertainties in the distances do not allow to put severe constraints on @xmath0al production by supernovae ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , recent attempts to understand the 1809 kev map of the sky have analyzed in more detail its correlation with the spiral structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "they derive a total @xmath0al mass of 2.5 m@xmath1 , from which at least 0.7 m@xmath1 can be attributed to massive stars , stressing that they can not exclude that a large fraction of @xmath0al is produced by novae or low  mass agb stars .",
    "therefore , with this still unclear panorama , it is worth studying the role played by classical novae in the synthesis of galactic @xmath0al .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , @xmath0al production requires moderate peak temperatures , of the order of @xmath4 k , and a fast decline from maximum temperature , conditions that are commonly achieved in nova outbursts . in the early 80s ,",
    "one - zone model calculations of explosive hydrogen burning nucleosynthesis by @xcite and @xcite suggested that classical novae might produce sufficient amounts of @xmath0al to account for some of the observed meteoritic anomalies but would not represent major galactic sources . but these calculations used only solar or cno - enhanced envelopes .",
    "new one - zone model calculations by @xcite and @xcite , on the basis of onemg white dwarf stars , produced large amounts of long - lived radioactive nuclei , such as @xmath5na and @xmath0al , concluding that these novae might represent important ( though not dominant ) sources of the galactic @xmath0al . however , according to @xcite , no @xmath0al production results for models with t@xmath6 k. recent calculations have refuted this result ( @xcite , @xcite ) , demonstrating the crucial role played by convection in order to carry some @xmath0al to the outer , cooler layers of the envelope , where its destruction through proton captures is prevented . but",
    "these fully hydrodynamical calculations involving onemg white dwarfs assume a composition for the white dwarf core ( which is partially mixed with the envelope ) based on old calculations of c - burning nucleosynthesis by @xcite that need to be updated . since the resulting nucleosynthesis is very sensitive to the envelope s composition , it is important to adopt a more realistic one . on the other hand ,",
    "there are large uncertainties on some crucial reactions involving @xmath0al production .",
    "thus , it is important to analyse the influence of the different prescriptions available on the final @xmath0al yields in the ejecta of classical novae . with this aim",
    "we have computed a series of hydrodynamic models of nova outbursts for several white dwarf masses and accretion rates , adopting updated initial chemical compositions and recent prescriptions for the crucial reaction rates .",
    "a one - dimensional , lagrangian , implicit hydrodynamic code has been developed , in order to follow both the hydrostatic accretion phase and the resulting hydrodynamic explosion ( @xcite and @xcite ) . a time - dependent formalism for convective transport",
    "has been included ( @xcite ) , where partial mixing in convective shells is treated by means of a diffusion equation ( @xcite ) . with this code",
    "we have performed a series of computations of the complete evolution of accreting white dwarfs with masses ranging from 1 to 1.35 m@xmath1 , accreting at rates between 2 and 2m@xmath1.yr@xmath7 and with an initial luminosity of 10@xmath8 l@xmath9 ( see @xcite for an application of this code to the study of @xmath10li synthesis in novae ) .",
    "the matter transferred from the companion is assumed to be solar - like , but some process of mixing between the envelope and the outermost shells of the underlying core ( shear mixing , diffusion ) is assumed to take place .",
    "this assumption is based on the current prediction that enhanced cno or onemg abundances are required in order to power the nova outburst and also to explain some of the observed abundances ( @xcite . see also @xcite and @xcite for recent calculations of co and onemg novae , respectively ) .",
    "the problem of the initial composition of nova envelopes is complicated and far from being understood .",
    "a compromise solution is to adopt a mixture with 50% by mass of core abundances .",
    "this may be considered as representative of the degree of mixing , in view of the mean metallicities observed in the ejecta of true onemg novae ( @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for an analysis of the influence of the degree of mixing in the synthesis of @xmath0al ) .",
    "the composition of the underlying core has been taken from recent detailed evolutionary models , specially for the case of onemg white dwarfs , which are the main contributors to @xmath0al production .",
    "these stars are made basically of @xmath11o and @xmath12ne ( @xcite and @xcite ) , since magnesium is almost absent ( so we will call them one models ) .",
    "we want to stress that this issue has important consequences on the final yields of some species , like @xmath0al .",
    "a complete reaction network has been directly coupled to the code to follow the detailed evolution of 100 nuclear species , ranging from @xmath13h to @xmath14ca , linked through more than 370 updated nuclear reactions .",
    "both the ground and the isomeric states of @xmath0al have been included ( @xmath0al@xmath15 and @xmath0al@xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "the influence of nuclear uncertainties on @xmath0al yields has been investigated by @xcite , with the use of the semi  analytical model of @xcite , for the cases considered by @xcite ( which have a high initial content of @xmath17 mg , @xmath180.1 by mass ) .",
    "they stressed the importance of the @xmath19=188  kev resonance in @xmath0al@xmath15 ( p,@xmath20si which is not included in the @xcite rate ( but whose strength was measured by @xcite ) and also of the large uncertainties still affecting the @xmath21al(p,@xmath22si rate . when @xmath17 mg is the primary source of @xmath0al , formation of @xmath0al@xmath15 through @xmath17mg(p,@xmath23al(@xmath24@xmath21mg(p,@xmath22al@xmath15 is bypassed by @xmath21al(p,@xmath25@xmath0si(@xmath26al@xmath16 , at high temperature .",
    "another important reaction for @xmath0al production is @xmath27al(p,@xmath28 mg which competes with @xmath27al(p,@xmath29si to partially recycle the initial mg  al material .",
    "while the @xmath27al(p,@xmath29si rate is sufficiently known in the temperature range of interest , the @xmath27al(p,@xmath28 mg one is still uncertain but appears to be lower than the one found in @xcite .",
    "since then , the resonances affecting this rate in the domain of temperature of novae have been studied by @xcite and @xcite . using two different techniques ,",
    "they derive similar upper limits for the strengths which are several orders of magnitude lower than those used by @xcite . instead of being recycled in the mg ",
    "al region , the nuclear flow mainly leaks out towards higher @xmath30 elements , with the result of a reduced @xmath0al production . concerning the importance of the initial chemical composition , we stress that the sum x(@xmath17 mg ) + x(@xmath21 mg ) , and not only x(@xmath17 mg ) , has to be considered as a seed for @xmath0al@xmath15 production : @xmath17 mg is readily transformed into @xmath21 mg by the fast @xmath17 mg ( p,@xmath23al reaction followed by the beta decay of @xmath21al , provided that the leak through @xmath0si can be neglected . furthermore , unlike the cno cycle , neither the nena nor the mgal cycles are expected to be closed and part of the initial neon and sodium will be transferred to the mgal region .",
    "indeed , in the temperature range @xmath31 the rate of the reaction @xmath32na(p,@xmath33ne is approximately equal to that of @xmath32na(p,@xmath34 mg according to @xcite or up to an order of magnitude lower following a recent reevaluation by @xcite .",
    "hence , a fraction of the initial x(@xmath32na ) will reach the mgal region providing additional seeds while the rest ends up as @xmath12ne .",
    "a fraction of @xmath5ne can also be transformed into @xmath32na . at the temperatures prevailing in nova outbursts ,",
    "the rate of @xmath12ne(p,@xmath2 ) is low and most of the initial @xmath12ne remains unburned .",
    "however , in classical novae involving massive white dwarfs , a significant fraction of @xmath12ne can be transformed through the nena cycle and via @xmath32na(p,@xmath34 mg into @xmath17 mg .",
    "accordingly , even in the absence of magnesium in the initial composition , @xmath0al can be produced from @xmath32na , @xmath5ne or even some @xmath12ne in the most extreme cases .",
    "snapshots of the evolution of several isotopes relevant to the @xmath0al synthesis ( @xmath32na , @xmath17 mg , @xmath21 mg , @xmath0al@xmath15 , @xmath0al@xmath16 and @xmath27al ) are shown in figure 1 , for a 1.25m@xmath1 one nova , with an accretion rate of 2m@xmath1.yr@xmath7 .",
    "the upper panel corresponds to the time when the temperature at the burning shell has already reached @xmath35 k. nearly flat abundance profiles along the accreted envelope are found , since the convective timescale is similar to the characteristic timescale of most of the dominant nuclear reactions .",
    "proton capture reactions on @xmath17 mg and @xmath21 mg provide the main source of the al - group nuclei which increase their initial abundances .",
    "when the temperature in the burning shell rises up to 2.1 k ( second panel ) , the nuclear timescale becomes much shorter than the convective timescale .",
    "hence , only partial mixing between adjacent convective shells occurs and non - flat profiles are obtained . at this time , the abundance of @xmath0al in the burning shell attains its maximum value , x(@xmath0al ) @xmath18 7.7 by mass .",
    "@xmath0al is being progressively destroyed near the burning shell ( panel 3 ) due to proton captures , since the seed nuclei @xmath32na , @xmath17 mg and @xmath21 mg have almost been exhausted . the final abundances in the ejecta",
    "are shown in the lower panel , which corresponds to the time when the white dwarf envelope has already expanded to a size of @xmath36 cm .",
    "the amount of @xmath0al in the envelope reflects the efficiency of convective transport , which carries @xmath0al isotopes to the outer , cooler layers of the envelope , where they can avoid destruction through ( p,@xmath2 ) reactions .",
    "the @xmath0al yields obtained in all models computed are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all @xmath0al production appears in its ground state , since the isomeric state does nt play any role .",
    "one novae are more important producers than co ones , due to the fact that peak temperatures attained during co nova outbursts are not high enough to break the cno cycle .",
    "therefore , the production of @xmath0al comes from the initial @xmath32na , @xmath17 mg and @xmath21 mg .",
    "it is worth noticing that the initial abundance of @xmath17 mg is much lower than the one adopted in the calculations performed by @xcite , which were based on the old nucleosynthesis computations of carbon - burning by @xcite .",
    "however , according to the above discussion , the presence of @xmath21 mg , @xmath32na and @xmath5ne partially compensates this absence .    only some combinations of peak temperatures around t@xmath37 12 k and rapid evolution from maximum favor @xmath0al generation .",
    "in this sense , explosion in low - mass one white dwarfs , where the lower gravity provides softer explosions with lower peak temperatures , favor @xmath0al production .",
    "our calculations ( see table 1 ) show a minimum in the @xmath0al production near @xmath38 m@xmath1 , which fairly agrees with the trend obtained in the semi - analytical analysis of @xcite , but does nt follow the monotonic decrease in the @xmath0al production as the white dwarf mass increases reported by @xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that the amount of @xmath0al ejected into the interstellar medium decreases as the white dwarf mass or the mass accretion rate increase , due to the fact that the mass of the envelope is smaller .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the amount of @xmath0al present in the ejecta of the models described in this paper is systematically lower than the mean values obtained by @xcite",
    ". two main effects influence this result : first , a different initial composition ( mainly the lower initial content of mg in our calculations ) , and second , the specific prescriptions adopted for the reaction rates of interest for the @xmath0al synthesis . the effect of the nuclear reaction rates has been checked by means of 2 models of 1.25 m@xmath1 onemg white dwarfs , accreting mass at a rate 2 m@xmath1.yr@xmath7 , which are similar to one of the models analyzed by politano et al .",
    "both models differ in the specific rates adopted for the reactions @xmath0al ( p,@xmath2)@xmath39si and @xmath39al(p,@xmath40)@xmath41 mg .",
    "since these reactions play no role during the accretion phase , the total amount of mass accreted as well as the proper pressure at the onset of the explosive phase are the same in both models .",
    "hence , the differences obtained in the final yields reflect exactly the different prescriptions for the reaction rates adopted . when the rates from vogelaar ( 1989 ) and champagne et al .",
    "( 1988 ) are used , we obtain a mean value of x(@xmath0al ) = 1.4 by mass in the ejected shells , whereas x(@xmath0al ) = 4.8 is found when the caughlan and fowler rates ( 1988 ) are used ( @xcite obtained x(@xmath0al ) = 9.45 by mass , for a similar model ) .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath0al /@xmath27al increases from 0.4 to 3.0 in the second model .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the differences between the two prescriptions for the rate of @xmath39al(p,@xmath40)@xmath41 mg : the lower cross - section reported by champagne et al .",
    "( 1988 ) results in a less efficient recycling of @xmath27al into @xmath17 mg , which essentially will end up in the form of @xmath0al .",
    "the production of @xmath0al by classical novae is very sensitive to the initial composition of the envelope and to the nuclear reaction rates adopted .",
    "one novae are more important @xmath0al producers than co ones , because seed nuclei for the nena and mgal cycles are almost absent in the latter ones . for the same reason , the amount of @xmath0al synthesized in one novae depends on the initial composition of the white dwarf core . when using the recently available chemical abundance profiles by @xcite , a lower @xmath0al production is obtained .",
    "furthermore , some improvements in the nuclear reaction rates since @xcite also lead to a lower @xmath0al production .    the amount of @xmath0al injected into the interstellar medium by one nova events decreases as the mass of the underlying white dwarf increases .",
    "hence , low - mass white dwarfs are most likely candidates for @xmath0al production .",
    "contribution from low - mass white dwarfs is favored both by the higher @xmath0al production and the higher ejected mass . but white dwarfs of masses lower than @xmath181.1 m@xmath1 are expected to be co white dwarfs , which are unable to produce important quantities of @xmath0al ( see table 1 ) . also , the observations of some ne - novae , such as qu vulpecula 1984 , indicate high ejected masses ( @xmath42 m@xmath1 ) , unobtainable if a massive one nova is the responsible of the explosion .",
    "this has led some authors to propose a new scenario ( @xcite , @xcite ) : low - mass co white dwarfs , undergoing episodic accretion phases at high rates , experience large metal enrichments from the ashes of he - burning .",
    "the subsequent nova explosion , correlated with a phase of a lower accretion rate , produces at the same time high @xmath0al abundances and high ejected masses .",
    "but these models require a fine tuning of some parameters relative to the cataclysmic variable , such as the mass accretion rate .        where x(@xmath0al ) represents the mean mass fraction of @xmath0al in the ejecta , frac(ne ) the fraction of ne - novae over the total number of classical nova outbursts ( between 0.25 and 0.53 , but typically @xmath44 , see @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath45 the amount of mass ejected in an outburst , and @xmath46 the nova rate ( @xmath47 , @xcite or @xmath48 , @xcite ) .",
    "adopting these estimates of r@xmath49 and frac(ne ) and our most favorable one nova case , for which @xmath45  ( @xmath0al ) = 1.7 m@xmath1 , we derive a maximum contribution of classical nova outbursts to the galactic @xmath0al in the range 0.1 to 0.4 m@xmath1 .",
    "although higher abundances of @xmath0al can be obtained for models with higher enrichment from core material ( i.e. , 75% ) , these may be considered as very extreme cases , in view of the typical metallicities observed in the ejecta of classical nova outbursts . in summary ,",
    "the contribution of novae to galactic @xmath0al is small as compared with the one required to explain comptel measurements ( between 1 and 3 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the most accepted hypothesis of young progenitors as sources of galactic @xmath0al .",
    "we want to stress that the two aspects that are crucial for the final @xmath0al yields are far from being understood ; these are the process of mixing between the core and the envelope , which determines the initial chemical profile , and the exact rates of the nuclear reactions involved in @xmath0al synthesis . this latter topic will surely be improved with the new compilation of nuclear reaction rates ( @xcite ) .",
