    "our approach is to use the simplest models possible with the smallest number of parameters in order to see how far we can get and what kind of sophistications are required by a comparison with observed galaxy properties .    our unified spectrophotometric and chemical evolutionary synthesis models allow to have a large number of observational constraints  spectrophotometric properties including gaseous emission and stellar absorption features as well as ism abundances  to restrict the small number of model parameters , basically the imf and the sfh . while in the local universe a 11 - correspondance between spectral types and morphological types is a long - standing matter of fact it is also clear that this correspondance has to break down at some yet unknown stage when going back towards the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "the choice of sfhs for the various spectral types is determined by a number of observational constraints .",
    "these include type - averaged luminosities , colours from uv through nir for nearby galaxy samples , emission and absorption line properties , template spectra , and hii region abundances that our model galaxies have to match after a hubble time as well as a comparison with observed galaxy luminosities and colours over a large redshift range ( cf .",

    "this view is supported by arguments based on mass estimes from column densities and absorber sizes at @xmath4 as well as by kinematic features consistent with rotation at velocities of order 200 @xmath5 ( prochaska & wolfe 1997a , b , 1998 ) .",
