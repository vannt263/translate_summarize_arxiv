    "geometrical dynamics is a dynamics of elementary particles , generated by the space - time geometry . in the space - time of minkowski",
    "the geometrical dynamics coincides with the conventional classical dynamics , and the geometrical dynamics may be considered to be a generalization of classical dynamics onto more general space - time geometries .",
    "however , the geometric dynamics has more fundamental basis , and it may be defined in multivariant space - time geometries , where one can not introduce the conventional classical dynamics .",
    "the fact is that , the classical dynamics has been introduced for the space - time geometry with unlimited divisibility , whereas the real space - time has a limited divisibility .",
    "the limited divisibility of the space - time is of no importance for dynamics of macroscopic bodies .",
    "however , when the size of moving bodies is of the order of the size of heterogeneity , one may not neglect the limited divisibility of the space - time geometry .",
    "the geometric dynamics is developed in the framework of the program of the further physics geometrization , declared in @xcite .",
    "the special relativity and the general relativity are steps in the development of this program .",
    "necessity of the further development appeared in the thirtieth of the twentieth century , when diffraction of electrons has been discovered .",
    "the motion of electrons , passing through the narrow slit , is multivariant .",
    "as far as the free electron motion depends only on the properties of the space - time , one needed to change the space - time geometry , making it to be multivariant . in multivariant geometry",
    "there are many vectors @xmath1 , @xmath2, ... at the point @xmath3 , which are equal to the vector @xmath4 , given at the point @xmath5 , but they are not equal between themselves , in general .",
    "such a space - time geometry was not known in the beginning of the twentieth century .",
    "it is impossible in the framework of the riemannian geometry . as a result",
    "the multivariance was prescribed to dynamics . to take into account multivariance ,",
    "dynamic variables were replaced by matrices and operators .",
    "one obtains the quantum dynamics , which differs from the classical dynamics in its principles .",
    "but the space - time conception remains to be newtonian ( nonrelativistic ) .",
    "multivariant space - time geometry appeared only in the end of the twentieth century @xcite .",
    "the further geometrization of physics became to be possible .",
    "it should note that there were numerous attempts of further geometrization of physics .",
    "they were based on the riemannian space - time geometry .",
    "unfortunately , the true space - time geometry of microcosm does not belong to the class of riemannian geometries , and approximation of real space - time geometry by a riemannian geometry can not be completely successful . in particular , the riemannian geometry can not describe such a property of real space - time geometry as multivariance .",
    "the multivariance of the space - time geometry was replaced by the multivariance of dynamics ( quantum theory ) .",
    "understanding of nature of elementary particles is the aim of the further geometr - ization of physics .",
    "this aim distinguishes from the aim of the conventional theory of elementary particles .",
    "let us explain the difference of aims in the example of history the chemical elements investigation .",
    "investigation of chemical elements reminds to some extent investigation of elementary particles .",
    "chemical elements are investigated from two sides .",
    "chemists systematized chemical elements , investigating their phenomenological properties .",
    "the results of these investigations were formulated in the form of the periodical system of chemical elements in 1870 .",
    "formulating this system , d.i.mendeleev conceived nothing about the atom construction",
    ". nevertheless the periodical system appears to be very useful from the practical viewpoint .",
    "physicists did not aim to explain the periodical system of chemical elements , they tried to understand simply the atom structure and the discrete character of atomic spectra .",
    "after construction of the atomic theory it became clear , that the periodical system of chemical elements can be obtained and explained on the basis of the atomic theory . as a result",
    "the `` physical '' approach to investigation of chemical elements appeared to be more fundamental , deep and promising , than the `` chemical '' one . on the other hand ,",
    "the way of the `` physical '' approach to explanation of the periodical system is very long and difficult .",
    "explanation of the periodical system was hardly possible at the `` physical '' approach , i.e. without the intermediate aim ( construction of atomic structure ) .",
    "thus , using geometrization of physics , we try to approach only intermediate aim : explanation of multivariance of particle motion ( quantum motion ) and capacity of discrimination of particle masses .",
    "discrete character of masses of elementary particles can be understood , only if we understand the reason of the elementary particle discrimination .",
    "contemporary approach to the elementary particle theory is the `` chemical '' ( phenomenological ) approach .",
    "it is useful from the practical viewpoint .",
    "however , it admits hardly to understand nature of elementary particles , because the nature of the discrimination mechanism , leading to discrete characteristics of elementary particle , remains outside the consideration .",
    "the most general geometry is a physical geometry , which is called also the tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) @xcite , because straights in t - geometry are hallow tubes , in general .",
    "the t - geometry is determined completely by its world function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is interval between the points @xmath8 and @xmath9 in space - time , described by the t - geometry .",
    "all concepts of t - geometry are expressed in terms of the world function @xmath0 .",
    "dynamics of particles ( geometric dynamics ) is also described in terms of the world function .",
    "the elementary particle is considered as an elementary geometrical object ( ego ) in the space - time .",
    "the elementary geometrical object @xmath10 is described by its skeleton @xmath11 and its envelope @xmath12 .",
    "the envelope @xmath12 is defined as a set of zeros of the envelope function @xmath13@xmath14the envelope function @xmath13 is a real function of arguments @xmath15 .",
    "any argument @xmath16 @xmath17 is a world function @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is supposed that ego with skeleton @xmath20 is placed at the point @xmath5 .    in t - geometry",
    "the vector @xmath21 is an ordered set of two points @xmath22 .",
    "the length @xmath23 of the vector @xmath4 is defined via the world function by means of the relation@xmath24    the scalar product @xmath25 of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 is defined by the relation@xmath26equivalence @xmath4eqv@xmath1 of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 is defined as follows .",
    "two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 are equivalent ( equal ) , if@xmath27 in the developed form we have@xmath28    skeletons @xmath20 and @xmath29 are equivalent ( @xmath30eqv@xmath31 , if corresponding vectors of both skeletons are equivalent@xmath32    the skeleton @xmath20 of ego at the point @xmath5 may exist as a skeleton of a physical body , if it may exist at any point @xmath33 of the space - time @xmath34 .",
    "it means that there is a solution for system of equations @xmath35for any point @xmath33 .",
    "further for brevity we take , that an existence of a skeleton means an existence of corresponding geometrical object .    in the space - time of minkowski the problem of the skeleton existence is rather simple , because at given @xmath30 and @xmath3 the system ( [ c1.6 ] ) of @xmath36 algebraic equations has a unique solution , although the number of equations may distinguish from the number of variables to be determined .",
    "indeed , in the four - dimensional space - time the number of coordinates of @xmath37 points @xmath38 is equal to @xmath39 ( the point @xmath3 is supposed to be given ) . if @xmath40 the number @xmath36 of equations is larger than the number ( @xmath39 ) of variables . in the case of an arbitrary space - time geometry ( arbitrary world function @xmath0 )",
    "existence of solution of the system ( [ c1.6 ] ) is problematic , and the question of existence of the skeleton as a skeleton of a physical body is an essential problem . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath41 , the number of coordinates to be determined is less , than the number of equations , and one may have many skeletons @xmath42placed at the point @xmath3 , which are equivalent to skeleton @xmath30 , but they are not equivalent between themselves .",
    "this property is a property of multivariance of the space - time geometry .",
    "this property is actual for simple skeletons , which contain less , than four points ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "for instance , for the skeleton of two points @xmath43 , which is described by the vector @xmath4 , the problem of multivariance is actual . in the space - time of minkowski",
    "the equivalence of two vectors ( @xmath44 ) is single - variant for the timelike vectors , however it is multivariant for spacelike vectors . in the general space - time",
    "the equivalence relation @xmath44 is multivariant for both timelike and spacelike vectors .",
    "the problem of multivariance is essential for both existence and dynamics of elementary geometrical objects ( elementary particles ) .",
    "let us formulate dynamics of elementary particles in the coordinateless form .",
    "dynamics of an elementary particle , having skeleton @xmath11 , is described by the world chain @xmath45direction of evolution in the space - time is described by the leading vector @xmath4 . if the motion of the elementary particle is free , the adjacent links @xmath46 and @xmath47 are equivalent in the sense that @xmath48    relations ( [ c1.7 ] ) - ( [ c1.9 ] ) realizes coordinateless description of the free elementary particle motion . in the simplest case ,",
    "when the space - time is the space - time of minkowski , and the skeleton consists of two points @xmath49 with timelike leading vector @xmath4 , the coordinateless description by means of relations ( [ c1.7 ] ) - ( [ c1.9 ] ) coincides with the conventional description .",
    "the conventional classical dynamics is well defined only in the riemannian space - time . the coordinateless dynamic description ( [ c1.7 ] ) - ( [ c1.9 ] ) of elementary particles is a generalization of the conventional classical dynamics onto the case of arbitrary space - time geometry .",
    "any geometry is constructed as a modification of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "but not all representations of the proper euclidean geometry are convenient for modification .",
    "there are three representation of the proper euclidean geometry @xcite .",
    "they differ in the number of primary ( basic ) elements , forming the euclidean geometry .",
    "the euclidean representation ( e - representation ) contains three basic elements ( point , segment , angle ) .",
    "any geometrical object ( figure ) can be constructed of these basic elements .",
    "properties of the basic elements and the method of their application are described by the euclidean axioms .",
    "the vector representation ( v - representation ) of the proper euclidean geometry contains two basic elements ( point , vector ) .",
    "the angle is a derivative element , which is constructed of two vectors .",
    "a use of the two basic elements at the construction of geometrical objects is determined by the special structure , known as the linear vector space with the scalar product , given on it ( euclidean space ) .",
    "the scalar product of linear vector space describes interrelation of two basic elements ( vectors ) , whereas other properties of the linear vector space associate with the displacement of vectors .",
    "the third representation ( @xmath0-representation ) of the proper euclidean geometry contains only one basic element ( point ) .",
    "segment ( vector ) is a derivative element .",
    "it is constructed of points .",
    "the angle is also a derivative element .",
    "it is constructed of two segments ( vectors ) .",
    "the @xmath50-representation contains a special structure : world function @xmath0 , which describes interrelation of two basic elements ( points ) .",
    "the world function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the distance between points @xmath5 and @xmath53 .",
    "the concept of distance @xmath54 , as well as the world function @xmath0 , is used in all representations of the proper euclidean geometry . however , the world function forms a structure only in the @xmath0-representation , where the world function @xmath0 describes interrelation of two basic elements ( points ) .",
    "besides , the world function satisfies a series of constraints , formulated in terms of @xmath0 and only in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "these conditions ( the euclideaness conditions ) will be formulated below .",
    "the euclideaness conditions are equivalent to a use of the vector linear space with the scalar product on it , but formally they do not mention the linear vector space , because all concepts of the linear vector space , as well as all concepts of the proper euclidean geometry are expressed directly via world function @xmath0 and only via it .",
    "if we want to modify the proper euclidean geometry , then we should use the @xmath0-representation for its modification . in the @xmath0-representation the special geometric structure ( world function )",
    "has the form of a function of two points . modifying the form of the world function , we modify automatically all concepts of the proper euclidean geometry , which are expressed via the world function .",
    "it is very important , that the expression of geometrical concepts via the world function does not refer to the means of description ( dimension , coordinate system , concept of a curve ) .",
    "the fact , that modifying the world function , one violates the euclideaness conditions , is of no importance , because one obtains non - euclidean geometry as a result of such a modification .",
    "a change of the world function means a change of the distance , which is interpreted as a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "the generalized geometry , obtained by a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry is called the tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) , because in the generalized geometry straight lines are tubes ( surfaces ) , in general , but not one - dimensional lines .",
    "another name of t - geometry is the physical geometry .",
    "the physical geometry is the geometry , described completely by the world function .",
    "any physical geometry may be used as a space - time geometry in the sense , that the set of all t - geometries is the set of all possible space - time geometries .",
    "modification of the proper euclidean geometry in v - representation is very restricted , because in this representation there are two basic elements .",
    "they are not independent , and one can not modify them independently .",
    "formally it means , that the linear vector space is to be preserved as a geometrical structure .",
    "it means , in particular , that the generalized geometry retains to be continuous , uniform and isotropic .",
    "the dimension of the generalized geometry is to be fixed . besides",
    ", the generalized geometry , obtained by such a way , can not be multivariant .",
    "such a property of the space - time geometry as multivariance can be obtained only in @xmath0-representation .",
    "as far as the @xmath0-representation of the proper euclidean geometry was not known in the twentieth century , the multivariance of geometry was also unknown concept .",
    "transition from the v - representation to @xmath0-representation is carried out as follows .",
    "all concepts of the linear vector space are expressed in terms of the world function @xmath0 . in reality ,",
    "concepts of vector , scalar product of two vectors and linear dependence of @xmath37 vectors are expressed via the world function @xmath55 of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "such operations under vectors as equality of vectors , summation of vectors and multiplication of a vector by a real number are expressed by means of some formulae .",
    "the characteristic properties of these operations , which are given in v - representation by means of axioms , are given now by special properties of the euclidean world function @xmath55 .",
    "after expression of the linear vector space via the world function the linear vector space may be not mentioned , because all its properties are described by the world function .",
    "we obtain the @xmath0-representation of the proper euclidean geometry , where some properties of the linear vector space are expressed in the form of formulae , whereas another part of properties is hidden in the specific form of the euclidean world function @xmath55 . modifying world function , we modify automatically the properties of the linear vector space ( which is not mentioned in fact ) . at such a modification",
    "we are not to think about the way of modification of the linear vector space , which is the principal geometrical structure in the v - representation . in the @xmath0-representation the linear vector space is a derivative structure , which may be not mentioned at all .",
    "thus , at transition to @xmath0-representation the concepts of the linear vector space ( primary concepts in v - representation ) become to be secondary concepts ( derivative concepts of the @xmath0-representation ) .    in @xmath0-representation",

    "the angle between the 3-vectors @xmath430 and @xmath431is equal to @xmath350 . if @xmath432 , then @xmath325 , and vectors @xmath394 and @xmath433 are elements of the same helix .    we see that the stabilizing vector @xmath395 reduces wobbling of vector @xmath394 . in the case of equation ( [ a4.46 ] )",
    "the spatial component @xmath329 of the 4-vector @xmath318 may be infinite . in the case of the equation ( [ b6.9 ] )",
    "the length @xmath434 of the spatial component @xmath329 of the 4-vector @xmath318 is less , than @xmath435 thus , the stabilizing vector @xmath395 reduces the wobbling of the world chain .",
    "one can not be sure , that this wobbling does not destroy the helical character of the world chain .",
    "however , the main question is , whether or not the evolution of the world chain in the spacelike direction lead to the world chain , which is timelike on the average .",
    "any next point @xmath436 of the world chain jumps along the timelike direction at the distance @xmath273 and in the 3-space , which is orthogonal to this direction , the point jumps at the distance @xmath437 .",

    "it should expect that in the case , when the vector ( [ c5.17 ] ) is stochastic , but its stochasticity is restricted by the relation ( [ c5.17 ] ) ( the angle @xmath422 is completely random ) , the mean world chain will be also timelike on the average .",
    "we can not prove this fact strictly now , but this result seems to be very probable .",
    "the obtained classical helical world chain ( [ a4.6 ] ) associates with the classical dirac particle , which has alike world line ( [ e6.33 ] ) , ( e6.34 ) .",
    "the direction of the mean momentum distinguishes from the direction of the 4-velocity .",
    "this fact is characteristic for both particles ( the dirac particle , and the particle , described by the world chain ( a4.6 ) ) .",
    "both particles have angular moment . for the dirac particle the mass @xmath175 , which enters in the dirac equation , distinguishes from the mass @xmath445 of the particle moving along the world line ( [ e6.33 ] ) , ( [ e6.34 ] ) @xcite . as to the mass of the particle , described by the world chain ( [ a4.6 ] ) , it is not yet determined . for determination of the mass , one needs to consider the world chain ( [ a4.6 ] ) of charged particle with the skeleton @xmath446 in the distorted space - time of klein - kaluza , containing electromagnetic field .",
    "existence of helical world chain with timelike axis seems to be rather unexpected , because leading vectors @xmath259 of the chain are spacelike , and it corresponds to superluminal motion of a particle .",
    "superluminal motion seems to be incompatible with the relativity principle , which admits only motion with the speed less , than the speed of the light .",
    "however , this constraint is valid only for continuous space - time geometry , which admits unlimited divisibility . in a discrete geometry",
    "there are no distances less , than some elementary length , and it is difficult to formulate the relativity principle statement on impossibility of superluminal motion .",
    "one needs another more adequate formulation of the relativity principle .    is the space - time geometry ( [ a4.14 ] ) discrete ? at @xmath447 the space - time geometry ( [ a4.14 ] ) turns to the space - time geometry@xmath448which is certainly discrete , because in the space - time there no timelike intervals @xmath57 , which are less , than @xmath195 , and there are no spacelike intervals @xmath449 , which are less , than @xmath195 . in such a space - time geometry",

    "the discreteness may be complete , when the density @xmath468vanishes in some region as in the case ( [ a7.10 ] ) .",
    "but the discreteness may be incomplete , as in the case ( [ a7.7 ] ) . in this case for @xmath469",
    "we have @xmath470{g_{1}\\left ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm{d}}\\right ) } + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{g_{1}\\left ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm{d}}\\right ) } } \\right ) , \\qquad \\sigma _ { \\mathrm{d}}\\in \\left ( -2\\lambda _ { 0}^{2},2\\lambda _ { 0}^{2}\\right )   \\label{a7.11}\\]]where@xmath471the expression ( [ a7.11 ] ) is a symmetric function of @xmath472 , as one can see from ( [ a7.3 ] ) .",
    "it is symmetric , indeed , although it does not look formally as a symmetric function of @xmath233 .",
    "numerical values of @xmath473 @xmath474 are presented in the table @xmath475the relative density @xmath450 is less , than unity .",
    "it may be interpreted in the sense , that the space - time geometry is discrete only partly .",
    "nevertheless the incompletely discrete space - time geometry discriminates most of world chains with spatial leading vector , remaining only some of them .",
    "multivariance of particle motion and discrimination of some states of motion play the crucial role in structure of elementary particles , as well as in the structure of atoms .",
    "let us explain this circumstance in the example of the hydrogen atom . according to laws of the classical mechanics the electron of the hydrogen atom is to fall onto the nucleus due to the coulomb attraction .",
    "two reasons prevent from this falling : ( 1 ) multivariant ( stochastic ) motion of the electron , and ( 1 ) rotation of electron around the nucleus .    the multivariant motion of the electron leads to escape of the electron from the nuclear surface .",
    "this process has the same nature , as an escape of dust from the earth surface . moving multivariantly ( as brownian particles ) , the flecks of dust form a stationary distribution in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "if multivariance of their motion is cut out , the flecks of the dust fall onto the surface of the earth .",
    "statistical description of the electron distribution and the dust distribution are different , because the multivariant electron motion is conceptually relativistic , whereas the brownian particles motion is nonrelativistic .",
    "one may describe brownian particles by means of probabilistic statistical description , whereas one may use only dynamical conception of statistical description for statistical description of multivariant motion of relativistic particles .",
    "rotation of the electron around the nucleus creates the field of centrifugal force , which is added to the coulomb force . as a result",
    "additional distributions of the electrons appear .",
    "if the obtained distribution of electrons is nonstationary , the electrons emanate the electromagnetic radiation until the electron distribution becomes to be stationary .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic radiation carries out discrimination of nonstationary states ( electron distributions ) .",
    "the multivariance of the electron motion and mechanism of discrimination of non - stationary states generates the structure of the hydrogen atom and discrete character of the radiation spectra . from the mathematical viewpoint",
    "the discrete character of the electron states is conditioned by procedure of the eigenstates determination .",
    "only eigenstates of the hamilton operator appear to be stationary and stable .",
    "the multivariance of the particle motion and some mechanism of discrimination play also the crucial role in the understanding of the structure of elementary particles .",
    "however , in the case of the elementary particle structure the discrimination mechanism is conditioned by some metric ( geometric ) forces , which appear , when we use space - time geometry of minkowski instead of the real multivariant space - time geometry .",
    "formally these forces have the form of additional terms of the type ( [ a4.18 ] ) in dynamic equations .",
    "these additional terms are expressed via the space - time distortion @xmath250 .",
    "they describe both multivariance of motion and the discrimination mechanism .",
    "the multivariance of motion is associated with the multivariance of the vector equivalence definition ( [ a1.3 ] ) , whereas the discrimination mechanism is associated with the zero - variance of the same definition ( [ a1.3 ] ) for some vectors .",
    "besides , as we have seen , the zero - variance ( discrimination ) is associated with the discreteness ( or partial discreteness ) of the space - time geometry .",
    "it is very important , that consideration of multivariant space - time geometry _ is not a hypothesis _ , which needs an experimental test .",
    "consideration of the multivariant space - time geometry is a corollary of correction of our imperfect conception of geometry .",
    "conception of geometry , based on supposition that any space - time geometry may be axiomatized ( i.e. may be concluded from some system of axioms ) , is imperfect , because it does not admit one to construct multivariant geometry conceptually .",
    "however , the motion of electrons and other elementary particles is multivariant .",
    "multivariance of this motion is an experimental fact , which can not be ignored .",
    "as far as the imperfect conception of geometry did not admit one to construct multivariant space - time geometry , investigators were forced to ascribe multivariance to dynamics , introducing quantum principles with all their attributes .",
    "the quantum principles look enigmatic and artificial , because multivariance is ascribed to dynamics , whereas it should be ascribed to the space - time geometry .",
    "multivariance and zero - variance as properties of the space - time geometry look as quite natural properties of the definition ( [ a1.3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it does not follow from anywhere , that equations ( [ a1.3 ] ) are to have unique solution for arbitrary world function , which determines the form of these equations",
    ". absence of any hypotheses is a very important property of the geometrical approach to the structure of elementary particles . besides",
    ", the geometrical dynamics is very general and simple .",
    "dynamic equations of the geometric dynamics do not use even differential equations .",
    "formulation of dynamic equations does not contain a reference to the coordinate system . on the other hand , when the geometric dynamics in the real space - time is described in terms of the space - time of minkowski , one obtains additional metric forces , which look rather exotic .",
    "they can be obtained hardly in the framework of the conventional approach .",
    "the conventional approach to the theory of elementary particles contains a lot of secondary concepts and properties .",
    "one may not see any discrimination mechanism in wave functions , field equations , branes , symmetries and other remote corollaries of the unknown structure of elementary particles .",
    "but it is impossible to obtain and to understand the discrete properties of elementary particles without a reliable mechanism of discrimination .",
    "even if investigating and systematizing these remote corollaries , one succeeds to obtain a perfect systematization of elementary particles , one can obtain structure of elementary particles from the perfect systematization with the same success , as one can obtain the atomic structure from the periodical system of chemical elements .",
    "consideration of t - geometry as a space - time geometry admits one to obtain dynamics of a particle as corollary of its geometrical structure .",
    "evolution of the geometrical object in the space - time is determined by the skeleton @xmath476 of the geometrical object and by fixing of the leading vector @xmath4 .",
    "the skeleton and the leading vector determine the world chain , which describes the evolution completely .",
    "the world chain may wobble , it is manifestation of the space - time geometry multivariance .",
    "quantum effects are only one of manifestation of the multivariance .",
    "it is remarkable , that for determination of the world chain one does not need differential equations , which may be used only on the space - time manifold .",
    "one does not need space - time continuity ( continual geometry ) .",
    "of course , one may introduce the continual coordinate system and write dynamic differential equation there .",
    "one may , but it is not necessary . in general , the geometrical dynamics ( i.e. dynamics generated by the space - time geometry ) is a discrete dynamics , where step of evolution is determined by the length of the leading vector .",
    "it is possible , that one will need a development of special mathematical technique for the geometrical dynamics .",
    "the real space - time geometry contains the quantum constant @xmath155 as a parameter . as a result",
    "the geometric dynamics explains freely quantum effects , but not only them .",
    "the particle mass is geometrized ( the particle mass is simply a length of some vector ) . as a result",
    "the problem of mass of elementary particles is simply a geometrical problem .",
    "it is a problem of the structure of elementary geometrical object and its evolution .",
    "one needs simply to investigate different forms of skeletons of simplest geometrical objects .",
    "in general , not all skeletons are possible , because at the spatial evolution the world chain is observable ( helical ) only for several skeletons .",
    "additional points of skeleton lead to additional ( sometimes unexpected ) properties of corresponding elementary geometrical objects ( elementary particles ) .",
    "note that the geometric dynamics does not contain a rotational motion .",
    "it contains only a shift .",
    "all vectors of the skeleton @xmath477 of the link @xmath478 are equivalent to vectors of the skeleton @xmath479 of the adjacent link @xmath480 .",
    "such a situation is quite reasonable , because the geometrical dynamics describes evolution of free particles . the rotating particle can not be completely free , because in the rotating particle there is centripetal acceleration .",
    "however , acceleration of all parts of the body has to be absent for completely free motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometric dynamics contains the spatial evolution , which absent in the conventional dynamics . from the geometrical viewpoint",
    "we may not discriminate spatial evolution on the basis , that the leading vector @xmath4 is spacelike and its length is imaginary .",
    "in fact the spatial evolution discriminates itself , by the fact , that the corresponding world chain is unobservable , in general .",
    "it appears to be observable only for some complex skeletons , consisting of more , than two points .",
    "the world chain , describing the spatial evolution is observable only in the case , when it may be localized near the world chain of the observer .",
    "it takes place , when the world chain has a shape of a helix with timelike axis , or some other shape , which may be localized near the world chain of the observer . as a result",
    "not all skeletons appear to be observable .",
    "although the geometric dynamics does not contain a rotation , but the corollaries of the rotation ( angular momentum , magnetic momentum ) may be obtained as a result of the spatial evolution , when the world chain is a helix .",
    "apparently , the fact , that such a `` particle rotation '' is a corollary of the spatial evolution , leads to the spin discreteness of the dirac particle .",
    "of course , such statements are to be tested by exact mathematical investigations of different types of skeletons and of different space - time geometries .",
    "however , such a statement of the problem is quite concrete and realizable .",
    "note , that the geometric dynamics in the real ( non - minkowskian ) space - time contains additional terms with respect to dynamics in the space - time of minkowski . from viewpoint of the space - time of minkowski",
    "these additional terms may be interpreted as some ( metric ) interactions , which take place inside the elementary particles . from the conventional viewpoint",
    "these interactions look very exotic and strange .",
    "it is impossible ( or very difficult ) to guess at them , starting from conventional conception of the space - time and dynamics . in the geometric dynamics",
    "there are no additional interactions , if we use the true space - time geometry . however , additional interactions appear , if we use inadequate geometry ( for instance , geometry of minkowski , or riemannian geometry ) . in other words , it is possible to compensate false space - time geometry by introduction of additional interactions .",
    "it is well known from the general relativity , that the motion of free body in the curved space - time looks as a motion in the gravitational field , if one interprets this motion as a motion in the space - time of minkowski .",
    "description of conceptually new unknown phenomena by means of a change of the space - time geometry is simpler , than an introduction of additional interactions , because the space - time geometry is described by the world function , which is a function of two points .",
    "the form of the world function for large distances is determined by the necessity of obtaining the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "restrictions , imposed on the world function at small distances , are determined by the condition , that the spatial evolution may describe the dirac particle .",
    "( very many elementary particles are the dirac particles ) .",
    "besides , the condition of localization of the world chain ( helical world chain ) imposes restrictions on parameters of the particle .",
    "not all parameters of particles appear to be possible .",
    "this condition is a condition of `` peculiar quantization '' of the particle parameters , which include the particle mass .",
    "let us note that the contemporary theory of elementary particles returns to geometrical considerations ( strings , branes ) .",
    "however , these considerations are restricted by the framework of the riemannian geometries and geometries close to the riemannian geometry .",
    "for instance , the quantum geometry , which uses operators instead of the point coordinates . this is some way of introduction of multivariance in the geometry .",
    "however , this geometry is developed on the basis of the linear vector space , which is a restriction on the space - time geometry . in any case",
    "the conventional approach to the space - time geometry considers only a part of all possible space - time geometries .",
    "one can not be sure , that the class of considered geometries contains true space - time geometry .",
    "of course , if one uses a false space - time geometry , there is a possibility to correct the false space - time geometry by means of additional interaction , generated by difference with the true space - time geometry .",
    "but such a correction is difficult , especially if the true geometry is discrete or close to the discrete geometry .",
    "note , that the geometry ( [ a4.0 ] ) is discrete , although it is given on the continuous manifold of minkowski .",
    "it is discrete , because the module of distance between any two points is more , than @xmath195 .",
    "it is very unexpected , because it is a common practice to consider any geometry on the manifold as a continuous geometry , although in reality the geometry is determined by the world function and only by the world function .",
    "a discrete geometry is associated with a grid .",
    "of course , a geometry , given on a grid , can not be continuous .",
    "however , a geometry , given on the continuous set of points ( manifold ) , may be discrete .    why the microcosm physics of the twentieth century did leave the successful program of the physics geometrization and choose the alternative program of quantum theory ?",
    "discovery of the electron diffraction need of multivariance of the microcosm physics .",
    "multivariance may be taken into account either on the level of the space - time geometry , or on the level of dynamics .",
    "the multivariant space - time geometry was not known in the thirtieth , when the electron diffraction was discovered .",
    "the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics had been constructed already , and it was applied successfully for explanation of the electron diffraction .    the space - time geometry is a basis of dynamics . introducing multivariance in dynamics , one can describe not only nonrelativistic phenomena of microcosm .",
    "one can describe also relativistic phenomena and that part of the microcosm physics , which is known as the theory of elementary particles .",
    "the principles of quantum mechanics , which introduce multivariance in the microcosm physics , were invented for the newtonian conception of the space - time , and their extrapolation to the relativistic phenomena appeared to be problematic .",
    "of course , some properties of the true space - time geometry may be taken into account by introduction of additional interactions .",
    "however , it is very difficult to invent and introduce additional interactions without understanding of these innovations .",
    "capacities of the geometrical approach are very large , especially if one takes into account all possible space - time geometries .",
    "the theory of elementary particles returns to the geometrical description , but this description is burthened by such concepts as wave function , string , brane , which have very abstracted relation to the structure of elementary particles and microcosm physics .",
