    "chemisorption on metal surfaces has been attracting a great deal of attention for over three decades ( for a review see , for example , @xcite-@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "its nature , however , despite quite involved experimental techniques and a number of data as well as many theoretical attempts is far from being well understood .",
    "one of the recent challenging problem has been concerned with structures and phase transitions in metal submonolayers adsorbed on ( 112 ) faces of tungsten and molybdenum @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found from leed experiments that many alkaline , alkaline - earth , and rare - earth elements adsorbed on these substrates form ordered structures which , for low coverages , consist of linear chains of adatoms being perpendicular to the atomic troughs at the surface .",
    "the chains of adatoms are often far apart from one another in the direction along the atomic troughs ( up to 9 lattice constants of the substrate ) thus forming _ long - periodic _ ( linear ) chain structures .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the structures possess a high thermal stability @xcite .    at higher coverages",
    ", however , submonolayer structures become much more complex for , in addition to coherent structures , there are one - dimensional incoherent or stressed submonolayer structures @xcite .",
    "it is clear , that lateral interactions of adatoms are most important in determining the properties of adsorbed overlayers like their structures , phase transitions , thermal stability , etc .",
    "@xcite . these interactions at ( 112 ) surfaces of bcc metals ( w , mo ) are believed to be due to a repulsive ( isotropic ) dipole - dipole interaction between adatoms with dipole moments , as well as to a long - range indirect ( anisotropic ) interaction via substrate electrons @xcite .",
    "the delicate balance between the two interactions seems to account , at least for low coverages , for the observed properties of adsorbed linear chain submonolayers .",
    "so far , only qualitative ( geometrical ) arguments have been put forward in an attempt to understand to what extent the indirect electronic interaction might be responsible for the observed chain structures @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study how a _ competition _ between the ( repulsive ) dipole - dipole and ( oscillatory ) long - range indirect electronic interactions could influence ordered submonolayer structures as well as their equilibrium thermodynamic properties ( phase diagram ) .",
    "this is done within a plausible two - dimensional lattice gas model which might describe linear chain structures for coverages up to 0.5 .",
    "the model is described in detail in section  [ s2 ] . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we calculate numerically the ground states ( @xmath4 ) and discuss their dependence on the model parameters .",
    "the mean - field approximation is used in section  [ s4 ] to calculate the corresponding phase diagrams . a possible application to describe low coverage linear chain submonolayers of li absorbed on w(112 ) and mo(112 ) has been presented in subsection  [ s4s2 ] . finally , section  [ s5 ] contains a general discussion and conclusions .",
    "it is generally believed , that chemisorbed atoms occupy , at low coverage at least , only preferred sites of a lattice commensurate with the underlying substrate lattice . here",
    ", we consider the ( 112 ) surface of bcc metals ( w or mo ) and the corresponding lattice of adsorption sites @xcite ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) .    .",
    "[ scheme ]    it turns out , that lattice gas models are quite useful in studying overlayer structures and their properties ( e.g. refs @xcite ) . as usual , a lattice gas model introduces the occupation variable @xmath5 at each adsorption site @xmath6 : @xmath7 if the @xmath6th site is occupied by an adatom and @xmath8 , if not .",
    "then , within the grand canonical ensemble , the hamiltonian is defined as @xmath9 where l denotes the rectangular lattice of n@xmath10n adsorption sites with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath11 is the chemical potential ( shifted , here , by the binding energy of an adatom to the substrate ) .",
    "of course , @xmath11 controls the adatom coverage @xmath12 with @xmath13 meaning a thermodynamic average .",
    "we are interested in a lattice gas model describing linear chain structures as observed experimentally for low coverages ( @xmath14 ) and , herefore , we can neglect many - body interactions . since , even in this case , the reliable first - principle calculation of effective lateral interactions is very difficult , following a detailed discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have considered a pairwise adsorbate interaction @xmath15 consisting of electrostatic and indirect interactions . thus , we have assumed @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stands for kronecker s symbol ( for notation see also fig .  1 ) .",
    "these interactions are of essential importance in forming linear chain structures of alkalis , alkaline - earths , and rare - earths adsorbed on the ( 112 ) surface of w or mo and they have the following meaning :    1 .   the first component in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , @xmath19 , describes a repulsive dipole - dipole interaction between two identical adatoms adsorbed at @xmath6 and @xmath20 , respectively ( see , for example , refs @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the dipole moment of an adsorption bond , @xmath21 , is usually estimated from the helmholtz formula . here , we neglect all depolarization effects due to many - body interactions and this seems to be justified for @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   the following component for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , represents an asymptotic part of the indirect interaction between adatoms via conduction electrons of the substrate ( all relevant literature on this interaction could be found in refs @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this particular interaction is highly anisotropic and is closely related to the existence of nearly flattened segments of the fermi surface being perpendicular to the @xmath25 $ ] axis directed along the atomic troughs of the substrate .",
    "an amplitude @xmath26 and a phase @xmath2 can be treated as phenomenological parameters and @xmath1 denotes a wavevector of electrons at the fermi surface . in our model",
    "we assume , following refs @xcite , that @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for the tungsten ( molybdenum ) substrate .",
    "it is needless to say , that this indirect ( oscillatory ) interaction is long - ranged ( @xmath29 ) and it could influence , as usually expected , properties of the absorbed submonolayers .",
    "we have neglected all contributions to the indirect interaction related to hole segments of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "for @xmath30 the @xmath31 term has been introduced to eq.([potential ] ) to facilitate the formation of linear chains of adatoms along the @xmath32-direction .",
    "this is a part of an _ attractive _ indirect interaction between adatoms along a chain and we assume that @xmath33 at the nearest - neighbour distance @xmath34 @xcite .    the model interactions , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , requires , however , some justification .",
    "first , the indirect , substrate mediated interaction ( ii ) reflects only the leading `` effective '' dimensionality of the electronic states ( e.g. refs @xcite,@xcite-@xcite ) mediating the interaction in the direction perpendicular to the chains . here",
    ", we neglect a usual part of the indirect interaction decaying like @xmath35 and associated with the `` spherical '' segments of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "of course , @xmath36 denotes a distance between two adatoms .",
    "secondly , we would like to comment on what role surface electronic states may play in the indirect interaction .",
    "it is known , that they could contribute to this interaction provided the fermi energy level intersects a band of the surface electronic states .",
    "then , depending on the effective dimensionality of the surface states , the indirect interaction becomes proportional either to @xmath37 ( quasi  one  dimensional surface states @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) or to @xmath38 ( two  dimensional surface states @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "a period of the oscillations will be determined by a wavevector at the fermi surface corresponding to the surface electronic states .",
    "recently , the field and photofield emission experiments on the clean w(112 ) surface have revealed the existence of surface states approximately 0.3@xmath39 below the fermi energy @xcite-@xcite . to our knowledge , however , there is so far _ no _ experimental evidence that surface states mediate the indirect interaction in the case of the linear chain submonolayers on the ( 112 ) surface of w(mo ) .",
    "consequently , we have neglected a would be contribution to eq .",
    "( 3 ) from the surface states .",
    "thirdly , the model interaction ( iii ) could be thought of as a usual substrate mediated interaction in the form @xmath40 ( see , for example , refs  @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) . in order to describe the linear chain structures we might assume that @xmath41 causes this indirect interaction to be attractive at the nearest  neighbour distance @xmath42 and to decay rapidly with distance .",
    "we can not also exclude a possibility that ( iii ) might be due to a virtual elastic distortion of the substrate surface @xcite .    at this stage",
    "it is important to notice , that although the interaction described by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) is long ranged , we may restrict ourselves to an extended but finite range of interaction , @xmath43 .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be presented in the following section .",
    "a search for all the lowest energy configurations at @xmath44 for the model described by eqs ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) presents a formidable problem . even in a simpler case of the dipole - dipole interaction only , as far as we know , it has not been possible up to now to find all the ground states .",
    "( for a review of the existing theoretical and numerical results concerning the ground states in two - dimensional lattices see , for example , refs @xcite-@xcite and the literature cited therein . ) .",
    "however , let us note that the ordered phases found experimentally at @xmath45 , as we have already discussed , are often composed of parallel linear chains , at least for low coverages ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this suggests , that a search for the minimal grand canonical ensemble energy configurations ( the ground states ) could be performed in two steps .",
    "first , we find the effective hamiltonian describing interactions between linear chains and only then we look for the ground states .      making use of the periodicity along the chains , we can write down the hamiltonian as an effective hamiltonian of a one - dimensional lattice gas type model , which describes the interaction between linear chains ( simply referred to as chains , hereafter ) .",
    "this hamiltonian has the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes chain variable with @xmath48 or 0 depending on whether there is a chain on a site j along the y direction or not .",
    "the chain ",
    "chain interaction energy at a distance @xmath49 reads    @xmath50    where @xmath51^{3/2 } } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath52 the binding energy per chain can be written as @xmath53    here , @xmath54  is the riemann zeta - function and j , l , and k are integers .",
    "it is well known , that the lattice gas effective hamiltonian , @xmath55 , is analogous to the hamiltonian of the ising model in an applied field . for a class of long - range interactions ( positive , convex , etc . )",
    "it has been possible to find in a one - dimensional case all the ground states for any rational @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 are integers with no common multipliers ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath59 phase diagram represents the complete devil s staircase with a rather involved fractal behaviour @xcite-@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the effective hamiltonian , @xmath55 , contains the indirect ( oscillatory ) interaction and , therefore , we are not able to find the ground states rigorously . also , the results of refs @xcite do not seem to be applicable because the considered interaction is truly long - ranged .      as usual , the long - range nature of the effective interaction between chains described by eq .",
    "( [ row4a ] ) poses a problem .",
    "it is easy to see that the interaction is dominated at large distances by the ( oscillatory ) indirect term and one has to sum up the infinite series ( see eq .",
    "( [ row4 ] ) ) for any would - be minimal energy configuration of @xmath60 s . instead",
    ", we approximate the problem ( see also refs @xcite and @xcite ) by assuming that there is a sufficiently large range of the adatom - adatom interaction , say , @xmath61 , beyond which a configuration under study is replaced by the average one having the same coverage @xmath62 .",
    "this average chain structure consists of equidistant `` chains '' with a spacing @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , adatoms are uniformly distributed along these `` chains '' with a density @xmath64 .    finally , we restrict ourselves to periodic configurations of @xmath60 s , i.e. there is a period @xmath57 ( positive integer ) such that @xmath65 for any integer @xmath66",
    ". these are called @xmath57-periodic configurations of @xmath60 s .",
    "now , the energy per chain of a given @xmath57-periodic configuration @xmath67 can be written in the form    @xmath68=\\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{j=0}^{p-1 } \\sum_{l=1}^r\\tilde{v}(l)\\sigma_j\\sigma_{mod_{p}(j+l)}- \\frac{1}{p}(\\mu + \\varepsilon_c)\\sum_{j=0}^{p-1}\\sigma_j + e_r(\\theta ) \\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{,}\\ ] ]    2 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 .    here",

    "( [ row5 ] ) depend on @xmath67 and involve exact summations .",
    "the remainder of the energy per chain , however , depends only on @xmath62 as it should have been expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that this model removes the particle - hole symmetry @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we propose a numerical procedure to find the ( periodic ) ground states .",
    "first , by using the bit representation of integers from the interval @xmath77 $ ] we generate numerically all @xmath57-periodic configurations of @xmath60 s with @xmath78 .",
    "the number of configurations could then be reduced by making use of the translational and/or inversion symmetries .",
    "secondly , we check explicitly which configurations of @xmath60 s afford the minimal value to the corresponding @xmath79 $ ] ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "of course , the results depend on model parameters , such as @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this will be discussed in the following subsection .      to describe a competition between the dipole - dipole and indirect interactions we require three independent parameters : @xmath83 , and @xmath1 .",
    "this results from eq .",
    "( [ row5 ] ) where @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 are rescaled by a factor of @xmath86 , thus changing effectively only the stability intervals of the ground states but not the ground states themselves . moreover , our approximation concerning the energy per chain of a given p - periodic configuration of @xmath87 ( eq . ( [ row5 ] ) ) and",
    "the numerical procedure introduce two more parameters : @xmath43 and @xmath82 . in principle",
    ", calculations should be performed for very large @xmath43 ( the larger the better ) and for @xmath88 going to infinity to allow for any periodic structure . in practice ,",
    "we have carried out calculations for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this is a compromise between the computing time and more precise results .",
    "our numerical tests show that relative changes of energy at @xmath91 ( in comparison with @xmath92 ) are less than one percent for a vast majority of @xmath57-periodic configurations of @xmath93 @xmath94 . also , the results for larger values of @xmath88 change the results only quantatively .",
    "we believe , that to understand the role the indirect interaction plays in determining the ground states , no additional significant insight can be achieved by extending the numerical computations to higher values of @xmath88 .",
    "we have applied our numerical procedure to determine the ground states for a number of different parameters : @xmath83 , and @xmath1 . some of the results are presented in tables  [ tab1]-[tab2 ] and fig .",
    "the tables contain sequences of ground states .",
    "here we use standard notation for the ground state , i.e. @xmath95 , which means @xmath58 chains in a unit cell of @xmath57 sites along the y direction ( fig .",
    "1 ) . at the same time",
    "@xmath96 and in the present analysis we are not interested in what are the actual structures of the ground states . also , it turned out to be convenient to express the strength of the indirect interaction , @xmath26 , in units of @xmath97 ( see refs @xcite and @xcite ) .    in fig .  2 we have shown explicitly examples of stability intervals of the corresponding ground states with respect to a reduced chemical potential @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "note that only halves of the stability intervals for @xmath100 and @xmath101 have been depicted .",
    "as usual , the coverage as a function of reduced chemical potential forms the so - called `` staircase '' .",

    "\\i ) _ dependence on _",
    "@xmath102    this parameter is a measure of a competition between the dipole - dipole and indirect interactions .",
    "the results shown in table  [ tab1 ] and fig.2 indicate that by decreasing @xmath103 ( or by increasing the strength of the indirect interaction ) one causes the following changes to the ground states :    * for very large values of @xmath104 we practically obtain the complete devil s staircase which is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) ( see also refs @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "* for large values of @xmath104 many narrow long - periodic ground states ( most of which correspond to higher coverages close to @xmath105 ) disappear from the staircase .",
    "the remaining ground states usually change their stability intervals and might transform into the ground states ( with a close coverage ) ( see fig .",
    "* for smaller values of @xmath104 the narrow long - periodic ground states ( corresponding to low coverages ) continue to disappear and we are left with few ground states some of which might be the long periodic ones ( see fig .  2(c ) ) .",
    "there can even be one ground state ( for example , @xmath106 for @xmath107 , and other parameters as in fig .  2 ) .",
    "this qualitative argument is supported by our calculations for other values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "for example , it also applies to @xmath108 and @xmath109 with @xmath110 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) but @xmath104 must be larger than @xmath111 .    at this point",
    "we would like to note that in the case of a sufficiently strong indirect interaction for @xmath112 and @xmath113 there is only a coexistence of the low - density ( @xmath114 ) and high - density ( @xmath115 ) disordered ground states .",
    "this means that an attraction effectively prevails between chains , thus leading to formation of two - dimensional islands .",
    "this particular result , however , seems not to be accounted for by our model of linear chains ( see section  [ s3 ] ) .",

    "the phase , @xmath2 , simply shifts uniformly the locations of minima of the corresponding indirect interaction thus allowing for the ground states with possible new periodicities or@xmath118and changed stability intervals ( in @xmath11 ) .",
    "the wavevector , @xmath1 , distorts uniformly the minima locations and a formation of the ground states is in this case even more complex .",
    "indeed , the results presented in table  [ tab2 ] indicate that for @xmath108 each sequence of the ground states consists of the ground states having one ( two ) long - range period(s ) . within our model",
    "this observation could be understood qualitatively by noting , that for a given @xmath1 , the actual ground state @xmath95 wins the energy competition between two terms : @xmath84 -e_r(\\theta)$ ] involving a structure of a would - be ground state ( i.e. @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is such that @xmath122 is close to @xmath123 or @xmath124 ( see eqs ( [ row5 ] ) , ( [ row5a ] ) , and ( [ row5b ] ) ) .",
    "this argument seems to be valid also for @xmath125 $ ] and @xmath126 despite the fact that the ground states start to gain on their energies . and",
    "this gain for @xmath127 is even more dramatic for now there are several new ground states .",
    "apart from long - periodic ground states there are also such ones as , for example , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "as a first step we adopt the mean - field approximation ( a discussion concerning the validity of this approach is postponed until the following section ) to describe ( equilibrium ) phase diagrams for linear chains structures with the competing dipole - dipole and long - range indirect ( oscillatory ) interactions . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the effective hamiltonian @xmath130 , eqs ( [ row4 ] ) , ( [ row4a ] ) , and ( [ row4b ] ) with a finite range of the adatom - adatom interaction @xmath131 .",
    "the reason is that thermal fluctuactions `` screen out '' the long - range indirect interaction @xcite and it is plausible to assume for a qualitative analysis , at least , that @xmath131 does not depend on temperature and the dipole - dipole interaction can be neglected for distances larger than @xmath132 .    following the standard procedure ( e.g. ref .",

    "it seems that @xmath146 is sufficient to account for some linear chain structures determined by the leed technique @xcite .",
    "we start with a model of linear chain structures which order via the dipole - dipole interaction only ( with an additional attraction along the chains )",

    "the phase diagram is shown for @xmath150 and this is due to our restriction to @xmath146 .",
    "the most interesting result is the following : the thermal fluctuations suppress long periodic phases and most of the phase diagram is dominated by the phases @xmath100 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",

    "finally , no `` hard core '' effects ( a relatively small atomic radius of a lithium atom ) make the model more realistic .",

    "4 , a low temperature scheme of phase transition corresponds quite well to li / mo(112 ) because the first order transitions occur through forming islands of a phase in the `` mixed - phase '' region .",

    "the cross - hatching depictes a region where the results do not seem to be reliable due to our restriction to @xmath146 .",
    "we have also found that at low temperatures and close to the disordered phase ( @xmath157 ) our numerical iteration procedure of solving eqs  ( [ row6a ] ) and ( [ row6b ] ) turns out to be non - convergent ( oscillatory behaviour ) .",

    "the results were obtained numerically and this was done without any approximations .",
    "we have shown that the interaction modifies in an essential way the ground states as obtained from the dipole - dipole interaction only .",
    "the general tendency is such that by increasing an amplitude of the indirect interaction , @xmath26 , one reduces the number of ground states . the full description , however , requires other parameters of the interaction , i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 . a detailed discussion is presented in section  [ s3s3 ] .",
