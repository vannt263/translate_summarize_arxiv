    "the large - scale magnetodydrodynamic(mhd ) alfvn wave @xcite , which is generated by the magnetic stress tensor , is a nondispersive low frequency wave mode and can be directly derived from mhd equations .",
    "the dispersive alfvn wave arises due to the finite - frequency and small - scale modifications @xcite .",
    "the dispersive alfvn wave is specially called as the kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) when its perpendicular wavelength is close to the order of the ion gyroradius @xcite , the ion acoustic gyroradius , or the electron inertial length @xcite .",

    "the properties of the kaw have been demonstrated by many experimental investigations in space @xcite and laborotary @xcite plasmas . in particular , the kaw can play an important role in the acceleration of energetic electrons in earth s",

    "extensive works have been done to discuss the local interaction process of three alfvn waves in which the magnitudes of three wavenumbers are comparable @xcite .",
    "a large amplitude dispersive alfvn wave can bring about the local nonlinear decay among themselves @xcite .",
    "local interaction between two counterpropagating alfvn wave packets can lead the wave energy to cascade from the energy injection region to the energy dissipation region in the mhd turbulence @xcite . through the local cascade ,",
    "the kaw can be generated at scales of the order of the ion inertial length or the ion gyroradius in the solar wind turbulence @xcite , however , it can not reach electron scales ( the electron inertial length or the electron gyroradius ) due to the large electron landau damping in these small scales @xcite .",
    "recently , some works have found that the nonlinear coupling of alfvn waves with different scales can occur @xcite .",
    "voitenko and goossens @xcite presented a nonlocal interaction among three alfvn waves and showed that a large - scale mhd alfvn wave can decay parametrically into two small - scale kaws .",
    "shukla and stenflo @xcite studied the three - wave interaction involving two kaws and one field - aligned alfvn wave with the finite - frequency modification , and they also showed two small - scale kaws can be nonlocally excited by this large - scale alfvn wave . unlike the local energy cascade in the mhd turbulence , the wave energy can be directly transferred from large - scale alfvn waves to small - scale kaws in these nonlocal interaction processes .    in this paper , we investigate the nonlocal interaction among one mhd alfvn wave and two kaws , and we shall show that the nonlocal coupling , a mhd alfvn wave + kaw @xmath0 kaw , may play an important role in generating the kaws with electron scales @xcite .",

    "our nonlinear wave - wave interaction requires a large - scale mhd alfvn wave and a small - scale kaw with counterpropagating directions .",

    ", as shown in figure 2 , the nonlocal coupling is stronger for the smaller scale kaws .",
    "so the observed electron scale kaws may be produced by this nonlocal mechanism .",
    "it should be pointed out that the nonlocal turbulence of the kaws still receives little attention and this problem will be further investigated in our future works .",

    "the qualitative discussion shows that this wave - wave interaction works in the plasmas with @xmath33 .",
    "the frequency relations among the two kaws and the mhd alfvn wave are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the quantitative discussion shows that the coupling is stronger for the more obliquely propagating mhd alfvn wave and for the kaws with lager perpendicular wavenumbers .",
