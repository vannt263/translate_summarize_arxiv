    "the discoveries of more than 340 extrasolar planets have revealed the remarkable diversity of planetary systems .",
    "for example , many jovian planets lie far inside the snow line , and many of their orbits are more eccentric than the orbits in the solar system .",
    "this diversity of planetary systems has prompted theorists to consider new modes of planet formation and migration , including type ii migration models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , planet - planet scattering models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and kozai cycles ( with tidal friction ) for planets in binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , planet - planet scattering and the kozai effect may help to explain the eccentric orbits of close - in planets , since type ii migration alone does not seem to produce large orbital eccentricities .",
    "observations of transiting planets may lead to better understanding of migration mechanisms through the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect : @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the rm effect is an apparent radial - velocity anomaly that is observed during planetary transits ( see @xcite for theoretical discussions ) . by measuring and modeling this anomaly",
    ", one can learn the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the angle between these two axes has been recognized as an useful diagnostic to investigate planet migration histories .",
    "the basic premises are that planets are formed with their orbital axes parallel to the stellar rotation axis , that type ii migration maintains a small spin - orbit alignment angle , while planet - planet scattering and the kozai effect may produce large spin - orbit misalignments ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and that tidal effects do not subsequently alter the spin - orbit angle @xcite . to the extent that these premises are valid , observations of the rm effect in transiting planets allow us to test planet migration models",
    ". one may compare the distribution of observed spin - orbit alignment angles with theoretical predictions based on the scenarios of planet - planet scattering or kozai cycles with tidal friction ( fabrycky & winn 2009 ) .",
    "measurement of the rm effect is especially interesting for transiting planets in eccentric orbits ( hereafter `` transiting eccentric planets '' or teps ) , because the migration mechanisms that produce eccentric orbits may also produce large spin - orbit misalignments .",
    "the number of known teps is still small .",
    "observations of the rm effect have been reported for a few cases , including hat - p-2b , xo-3b , and the subject of this paper , hd  17156b .",
    "hd  17156b was discovered in a doppler survey ( @xcite ; f07 ) and later found to transit its parent star .",
    "this planetary system stands out among the transiting planets for its large orbital eccentricity ( @xmath3 ) and relatively long orbital period ( 21 days ) .",
    "the host star is very bright ( @xmath4 ) , facilitating the detection of the rm effect and many other follow - up observations . for the hd  17156 planetary system , previously narita  et  al .",
    "( 2008 ; n08 ) reported a possible spin - orbit misalignment @xmath1 , based on radial - velocity data obtained at the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) .",
    "a more decisive conclusion , however , required further precise observations with better statistics .",
    "indeed cochran  et  al .",

    "( 2008 ; b08 ) obtained new radial - velocity data ( c08 : het and hjst datasets , b08 : tng dataset ) , and claimed a close alignment , @xmath5 ( c08 ) and @xmath6 ( b08 ) defined in @xcite for the projected spin - orbit alignment angle . ] .",
    "we report here on our new observations with the subaru 8.2 m telescope , covering a full transit of hd  17156b and providing the larger and more precise radial - velocity dataset for the system around the transit phase .",
    "section  2 summarizes our subaru spectroscopic observations and radial - velocity dataset , and section  3 describes the analysis procedure for the rm effect . section  4 presents and discusses the results for the derived system parameters .",
    "section 5 summarizes the main findings of the present paper .",
    "we observed hd  17156 over 6.5 hr covering a full transit of hd  17156b with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds : @xcite ) on the subaru 8.2 m telescope on ut 2008 november 7 .",
    "we employed the standard i2a set - up of the hds , covering the wavelength range 4940    @xmath7 6180   and using the iodine gas absorption cell for precise radial velocity measurements .",
    "the slit width of @xmath8 yielded a spectral resolution of @xmath990000 , and the seeing on that night was between @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "the exposure time was 35 minutes , yielding a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of approximately 180 per pixel .",
    "we processed the observed frames with standard iraf procedures and extracted one - dimensional spectra .",
    "we computed relative radial velocities following the algorithm of @xcite and @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "we estimated the internal error of each radial velocity as the scatter in the radial - velocity solutions among the @xmath94    segments of the spectrum .",
    "the typical internal error is 3  m  s@xmath11 .",
    "the radial velocities and their internal errors are plotted in figure  1 and summarized in table  1 .",
    "we empirically model the rm effect of hd17156 following the procedure of winn  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) . specifically , we simulate spectra that are affected by the rm effect , and then we `` measure '' the anomalous radial velocity of the simulated spectrum using the same algorithm that we use on the actual data .",
    "we start with the nso solar spectrum @xcite and deconvolve it to remove the rotational broadening of the sun .",
    "we neglect the differential rotation of the sun and adopt 1.85  km  s@xmath11 ( the rotational velocity at the equator ) for the deconvolution kernel .",
    "we then apply a rotational broadening kernel with @xmath12  km  s@xmath11 as appropriate to mimic the disk - integrated spectrum of hd  17156 ( f07 ) . in this step , for simplicity , we neglect differential rotation , microturbulence and macroturbulence , convection cells , and possible starspots and other active regions . finally , to simulate the rm effect , we subtract a scaled and velocity - shifted copy of the original unbroadened spectrum , representing the portion of the stellar disk hidden by the planet .",
    "we produce many simulated spectra using different values of the scaling factor @xmath13 and the velocity shift @xmath14 , and compute the apparent radial velocity of each spectrum .",
    "we thereby determine an empirical relation between the size of the planet and its position on the stellar disk , and the apparent radial velocity of the star .",
    "we fit a polynomial function to this relation , and find @xmath15.\\ ] ] as has been found previously ( e.g. , winn et al .",
    "2005 ) , this formula differs from the analytic formula presented by @xcite .",
    "the two formulas are nearly consistent , however , if we rescale the value of @xmath16 in the analytic ots formula by a factor of 1.2 . in this sense",
    "the ots formula may overestimate the projected stellar rotational velocity by @xmath920% .",
    "further discussions for the empirical fitting formulae for the rm effect are presented in section  4.3 .",
    "we analyze the rm effect of hd  17156b using our new subaru dataset , accompanied by published out - of - transit radial velocity datasets presented in f07 ( subaru ) and winn  et  al .",
    "( 2009a ; w09 ) ( keck ) . ( the keck dataset was originally taken by f07 , and w09 refined the radial velocities and added new data . )",
    "the out - of - transit data are needed to determine the keplerian orbital parameters of hd  17156b . after performing this analysis of the new transit data",
    ", we also repeated the analysis using all of the published radial - velocity datasets around the transit phase ( n08 , c08 , and b08 ) for comparison . in all of our analyses we consider the error in each radial velocity data point to be the quadrature sum of the internal error and 3  m  s@xmath11 ( representing possible systematic error such as `` stellar jitter '' ) .    for radial velocity fitting , we fix stellar and planetary parameters based on @xcite as follows ; the stellar mass @xmath17 [ @xmath18 , the stellar radius @xmath19 [ @xmath20 , the radius ratio @xmath21 , and the semi - major axis @xmath22 [ au ] .",
    "we also fix the quadratic limb - darkening parameters for the spectroscopic band containing many iodine absorption lines to @xmath23 and @xmath24 based on the tables of .",
    "in addition , we adopt an updated transit ephemeris based on simultaneous transit photometry as @xmath25 [ hjd ] and @xmath26  days based on unpublished data from the transit light curve project ( see e.g.  holman et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "the adopted parameters are summarized in table  2 .",
    "our model has 6 free parameters describing the hd  17156 system : the radial velocity semiamplitude @xmath27 , the eccentricity @xmath28 , the argument of periastron @xmath29 , the orbital inclination @xmath30 , the sky - projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath16 , and the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis @xmath2 .",
    "our model also has one free parameter , a velocity offset , for each independent radial velocity dataset ( @xmath31 : our subaru dataset , @xmath32 : subaru in f07 , @xmath33 : keck in w09 , @xmath34 : het in c08 , @xmath35 : hjst in c08 , @xmath36 : oao in n08 , @xmath37 : tng in b08 ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath38 statistic @xmath39 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 are the observed radial velocity data and @xmath41 are the values calculated based on a keplerian orbit and on the rm calibration formula given above .",
    "we determine optimal orbital parameters by minimizing the @xmath38 statistic using the amoeba algorithm @xcite , and estimate confidence levels based on the criterion @xmath42 when a parameter is stepped away from its optimal value and the other parameters are re - optimized .",
    "we first fit our subaru dataset with the out - of - transit subaru ( f07 ) and keck ( w09 ) datasets .",
    "figure  2 shows our subaru dataset plotted with the best - fitting model curve .",
    "we find @xmath0 , indicating a fairly good alignment between the sky projections of the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis .",
    "this value is similar to the result quoted by c08 ( @xmath5 ) , which was based on f07 , n08 , and c08 datasets .",
    "next we conduct another analysis using all of the published datasets ( namely , with f07 , n08 , c08 , b08 , and w09 datasets ) .",
    "figure  3 plots all radial velocity data with the best - fitting model curve . in this case",
    "we find @xmath43 , and the results for the other parameters are in agreement with the previous analysis .",
    "the results of both analyses are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we note that the central value of @xmath2 for the combined analysis is somewhat biased by the tng dataset .",
    "this is because the contribution to @xmath38 from the tng dataset is disproportionate ( @xmath44 from 28 tng radial velocities ) , whereas the ratio of @xmath45 contribution and the number of data points is approximately unity for all of the other datasets .",
    "this suggests that the errors in the tng dataset may have been underestimated .",
    "for this reason the results of the joint analysis should be interpreted with caution .    in addition",
    ", we conduct the same fitting procedure for the oao dataset ; for the het , hjst , and oao datasets ; and for the tng dataset alone , in order to make comparisons with previous studies ( n08 , c08 , and b08 ) . note that we employ the same assumptions as described in section  3 , and we incorporate the out - of - transit velocities from the f07/subaru and w09/keck datasets .",
    "the results are @xmath46 ( as compared to @xmath1 by n08 ) for the oao dataset ; @xmath47 ( @xmath5 by c08 ) for het , hjst , and oao datasets ; and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 by b08 ) for the tng dataset . consequently , we confirm that the oao dataset indeed implies a large spin - orbit misalignment , but its poorer radial velocity accuracy and time - resolution would have caused the fluke with lower statistical significance .",
    "in addition , although our analyses are well consistent with n08 and c08 , we are not able to reproduce the b08 result .",
    "the systematic difference may be caused by the fact that b08 first fitted only the out - of - transit data and determined a radial velocity offset ( namely , the baseline of the keplerian motion ) of the tng dataset using fewer samples than we have here .",
    "such a treatment might be problematic since the rm amplitude of hd  17156b is only @xmath50  m  s@xmath11 , and a difference of offset velocity as much as several m  s@xmath11 would cause a large systematic difference in @xmath2 .      in the above analyses , we fixed some parameters as summarized in table  2 , which were independently determined by previous high accuracy photometric and spectroscopic studies . in order to check the robustness of our results and to estimate the level of systematic errors , we retry the fitting for our subaru dataset , the f07 subaru dataset , and the w09 keck dataset with different adopted parameter values as follows ;",
    "@xmath51 ( a greater limb - darkening case ) ; @xmath52 ( a smaller limb - darkening case ) ; @xmath53 ( 1@xmath54 lower limit in w09 ) ; and @xmath55 ( 1@xmath54 upper limit in w09 ) .",
    "we note that we find @xmath56 within its error reported in b08 and w09 does not make a significant difference in results ( only @xmath16 is affected , and only by a few percent ) .",
    "we first find that @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and offset velocities are insensitive to the fixed parameters .",
    "in addition , respective results for the spin - orbit alignment angle @xmath2 are @xmath57 ( @xmath51 ) ; @xmath58 ( @xmath52 ) ; @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) ; and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "consequently , we confirm all results of @xmath2 for the test cases are well within our 1@xmath54 uncertainty .    in contrast",
    ", we find appreciable systematic errors in the inclination @xmath30 and @xmath16 .",
    "results for the inclination @xmath30 are @xmath63 ( @xmath51 ) ; @xmath64 ( @xmath52 ) ; @xmath65 ( @xmath60 ) ; and @xmath66 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the dependence of the inclination on the limb - darkening parameters is small ( within @xmath67 error ) , but the dependence on @xmath68 is as large as a few degrees ( over 3@xmath54 ) . when the covariance with the @xmath68 parameter is taken into account , our constraint on @xmath30 based on the rm anomaly",
    "is approximately @xmath69@xmath70 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the constraint by w09 ( @xmath71@xmath72 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we derive the projected velocity of stellar rotation @xmath16 as , @xmath73  km  s@xmath11 ( @xmath51 ) ; @xmath74  km  s@xmath11 ( @xmath52 ) ; @xmath75  km  s@xmath11 ( @xmath60 ) ; and @xmath76  km  s@xmath11 ( @xmath62 ) . based on these results",
    "we find that the result for @xmath16 is more robust than that for @xmath30 , but the true error is approximately 1  km  s@xmath11 ( the span of the results just quoted ) .",
    "we also consider possible time - correlated errors in the radial velocity datasets , due to possible instrumental or astrophysical effects .",
    "when present , this so - called `` red noise '' complicates the accurate estimation of parameter errors @xcite . to check for red noise in the subaru dataset , we calculate the standard deviation of the residuals between the data and the best - fitting model , and also the time - averaged ( binned ) residuals . in the absence of time - correlated noise ,",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath77-point binned residuals ( @xmath78 ) would decrease as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of binned residuals .",
    "we find the standard deviation of residuals to be @xmath81  m  s@xmath11 , and if there is no correlated noise then we expect the standard deviation of 5-point binned residuals to be @xmath82  m  s@xmath11 .",
    "the actual standard deviation of residuals with 5-point binning is @xmath83  m  s@xmath11 .",
    "this is only 7% larger than the expected value ; apparently the level of time - correlated noise is small .",
    "@xcite pointed out a systematic difference in the amplitude of the rm anomaly between the results of rm simulations and the analytic ots formula for the hd  209458 system .",
    "a preliminary analysis of hirano  et  al .",
    "( in  prep . ) indicates the systematic difference between the ots formula and the rm simulations is due to the fact that the former computes the spectral shift via intensity - weighted average while the latter via the cross - correlaiton .",
    "specifically , they showed that the amplitude of the systematics depends on the spin rotation velocity of the host star .",
    "following their procedure , we also confirmed the similar systematics for the hd  17156 system using the subaru analysis routine ( section  3 ) .",
    "in addition to that , we show in this subsection that the input value of the spin rotation velocity , more specifically @xmath16 , in the empirical rm formula does not bias the estimate of the other parameters .",
    "when we fit our subaru dataset using the ots formula , we find @xmath84  km  s@xmath11 , which is @xmath920% higher than the result using the simulation - based formula .",
    "the results for all the other parameters are essentially unchanged .",
    "thus the choice of the rm calibration formula corresponds to a @xmath920% change in the inferred value of @xmath85 .",
    "we also expect that the formula of @xcite would give similar results to the ots formula , as both formulas were calculated under the same assumption : that the anomalous radial velocity is equal to the shift in the intensity - weighted mean wavelength of the absorption lines .    in the previous studies , the @xmath16 value assumed for the simulation was generally in agreement with the resultant fitted value .",
    "however , we obtained @xmath86  km  s@xmath11 from the rm analyses even though we assumed @xmath12  km  s@xmath11 in the simulations .",
    "ideally the fitted value of @xmath85 should be consistent with the assumed one . in order to check the dependence of assumed @xmath16 value on fitting results , we reran the simulations assuming @xmath87  km  s@xmath11 for the convolution kernel instead of the original choice of 2.6  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the revised empirical formula is @xmath88.\\ ] ] with this revised formula , we repeated the analysis using the subaru dataset along with the f07 and w09 datasets .",
    "we find @xmath89  km  s@xmath11 and the values of the other parameters are essentially unchanged .",
    "the results are now self - consistent and suggest that the choice of an empirical formula does not make a significant difference .",
    "thus we conclude that the determination of @xmath2 of the current system is fairly insensitive to the choice of the rm formula .",
    "we observed a full transit of hd  17156b with the subaru 8.2 m telescope , and measured radial velocities with the highest time - resolution and accuracy that have yet been presented for transit observations of this system .",
    "we analyzed the rm effect and found that the sky - projected spin - orbit alignment angle of the hd  17156 system is @xmath90 .",
    "this result supersedes the previous claim of @xmath1 by n08 , which was due to lower precision and poor statistics of the previous datasets .",
    "thus we conclude that the hd  17156 is not strongly misaligned , and as such it joins the majority of other systems for which the rm effect has been detected ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the projected spin - orbit angle is representative of the true spin - orbit angle , then the orbital tilt of hd  17156b is not so different from the orbital tilt of the jupiter relative to the equatorial plane of the sun .",
    "the other teps for which rm observations have been reported include hat - p-2b and xo-3b .",
    "interestingly the outcomes of the measurements of the two systems were quite different ; hat - p-2b is also well - aligned while xo-3b has a significant spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "the existence of at least some highly - inclined planets would support the notion that some teps have migrated through planet - planet scattering or the kozai effect and tidal friction .",
    "however , with just three samples one can not draw robust conclusions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "further observations of the rm effect for teps are desired .",
    "recently the highly eccentric , long period planet hd  80606b has been added to the list of teps .",
    "observations of the rm effect for that system were presented by @xcite , but because of their limited time coverage a robust determination of @xmath2 is not yet possible .",
    "it will be very interesting to see the rest of the rm anomaly filled in with future observations .",
    "we acknowledge invaluable support of our observations by akito tajitsu , a support scientist for the subaru hds . this paper is based on data collected at subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
