    "rgis provide such a method , establishing a direct relationship between the observables at the weak scale and the messenger scale parameters .",
    "in this article we have studied the probability distributions of a set of rgis in the mssm arising from symmetry arguments .",

    "the probability distributions for the ggm parameters can be determined from those of the rgis and present some interesting features as well .",

    "the determination of the messenger scale in ggm through rgis demands the measurement of both the first and third generation fermion masses as well as the higgs masses , and hence it is not practical at this moment .",
    "we also analyze the more simplistic subset of models given by mgm .",
    "since the entire model space of mgm is determined by only 2 parameters , we are able to extract information about the possible scale of susy particles as well as the messenger scale in this scenario .",
    "it is clear that although the analysis we describe already has interesting features , the probability distributions of the rgis will become particularly useful when the lhc starts revealing the presence of supersymmetric particles at the weak scale . in such a case , the probability distribution of the rgis will become sharper and will start showing important features of the supersymmetry - breaking mass parameters at the messenger scale . due to the higher cross sections for the production of supersymmetric particles , the higher luminosities and the higher energy reach , the 8  tev run this year will lead to relevant constraints on the supersymmetric particle masses .",
    "it could also lead to the first hint of the presence of supersymmetry , beyond the indirect ones associated with higgs search results",

    "the most immediate consequence of flavor - blindness is the vanishing of @xmath99 and @xmath100 . therefore these invariants provide us with a direct test of the flavor - independent hypothesis with a minimal set of measurements .",
    "more precisely , they allow this hypothesis to be ruled out : measuring @xmath101 or @xmath102 at the low scale implies high - scale family non - universality ; however , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , measuring @xmath103 and @xmath104 at the low scale does not necessarily indicate high - scale universality .",
    "current experimental data from flavor physics strongly motivates a flavor - universal mediation mechanism for susy - breaking . accordingly ,",
    "if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are found to vanish , it is reasonable to proceed a step further and attempt to extract constraints on the high - scale values of the flavor - blind mssm soft parameters from the rgis .",
    "the 7 scalar and 3 gaugino soft mass parameters in the flavor - blind mssm can be expressed uniquely in terms of the 10 invariants @xmath105 through @xmath3 listed in table  [ table.inv ] .",
    "these are listed in eqs .",
    "( [ gauginos ] ) and ( [ ml1])-([flaveq2 ] ) .",
    "note that these relations depend on the 3 gauge couplings and further all couplings and soft parameters are assumed to be given at the messenger scale : @xmath106 @xmath107    using the invariants @xmath1 and @xmath2 these may be expressed entirely in terms of @xmath108 .",
    "equivalently , one can reduce the degrees of freedom at the high scale to a single parameter , which can be taken to be the value of that scale .",
    "in particular this permits tests of more restrictive flavor - universal models such as msugra , taking @xmath108 at the gut scale .",
