    "different aspects of nonclassical properties of electromagnetic field have been studied since the advent of quantum optics .",
    "however , the interest on nonclassical states has been considerably escalated with the progress of interdisciplinary field of quantum computation and quantum communication in recent past as a large number of applications of nonclassical states have been reported in context of quantum computation and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is shown that squeezed states can be used for the implementation of continuous variable quantum cryptography @xcite and teleportation of coherent states @xcite , antibunched states can be used to build single photon sources @xcite , entangled states are essential for the implementation of a set of protocols of discrete @xcite and continuous variable quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , dense - coding @xcite , etc . , states violating bell s inequality are useful for the implementation of protocols of device independent quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "study of the possibility of generation of nonclassical states ( specially , entanglement and nonlocal characters of quantum states ) in different quantum systems have recently become extremely relevant and important for the researchers working in different aspects of quantum information theory and quantum optics .",
    "existence of entanglement and other nonclassical states in a large number of bosonic systems have already been reported ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is still interesting to study the possibility of generation of nonclassical states in experimentally realizable simple systems .",
    "a specific system of this kind is a nonlinear optical coupler which can be easily realized using optical fibers or photonic crystals .",
    "optical couplers are interesting for several reasons .",
    "firstly , in a coupler the amount of nonclassicality can be controlled by controlling the interaction length and the coupling constants .",
    "further , optical couplers are of specific interest as recently matthews et al .",
    "have experimentally demonstrated manipulation of multiphoton entanglement in quantum circuits constructed using optical couplers @xcite , mandal and midda have shown that nand gate ( thus , in principle a classical computer ) can be build using nonlinear optical couplers @xcite .",
    "motivated by these facts we aim to systematically investigate the possibility of observing nonclassicality in nonlinear optical couplers . as a first effort",
    "we have reported lower order and higher order entanglement and other higher order nonclassical effects in an asymmetric codirectional nonlinear optical coupler which is prepared by combining a linear waveguide and a nonlinear ( quadratic ) waveguide operated by second harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "waveguides interact with each other through evanescent wave . extending the earlier investigation @xcite here we study a similar asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler for contradirectional propagation of fields .",
    "this type of contradirectional asymmetric optical coupler was studied earlier by some of us @xcite . however , in the earlier studies @xcite intermodal entanglement and some of the higher order nonclassical properties studied here were not studied .",
    "further , in those early studies second - harmonic mode ( @xmath7 was assumed to be pumped with a strong coherent beam . in other words , @xmath8 mode was assumed to be classical and thus it was beyond the scope of the previous studies to investigate single - mode and intermodal nonclassicalities involving this mode .",
    "interestingly , completely quantum mechanical treatment adopted in the present work is found to show intermodal squeezing in a compound mode involving @xmath8 mode .",
    "in addition , conventional short - length solutions of heisenberg s equations of motion were used in earlier studies @xcite , but recently it is established by some of us that using improved perturbative solutions obtained by sen - mandal approach @xcite we can observe several nonclassical characters that are not observed using short - length ( or short - time approach ) @xcite . keeping these facts in mind",
    "present paper aims to study nonclassical properties of this contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler with specific attention to entanglement using perturbative solution obtained by sen - mandal technique .",
    "nonclassical properties of different optical couplers are extensively studied in past ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "specially , signatures of nonclassicality in terms of photon statistics , phase properties and squeezing were investigated in codirectional and contradirectional kerr nonlinear couplers having fixed and varying linear coupling constant @xcite , raman and brillouin coupler @xcite and parametric coupler @xcite , asymmetric @xcite and symmetric @xcite directional nonlinear coupler etc . here",
    "it would be apt to note that the specific coupler system that we wish to study in the present paper has already been investigated @xcite for contradirectional propagation of classical ( coherent ) input modes and it is shown that depth of nonclassicality may be controlled by varying the phase mismatching @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "existing studies are restricted to the investigation of lower order nonclassical effects ( e.g. , squeezing and antibunching ) under the conventional short - length approximation .",
    "only a few discrete efforts have recently been made to study higher order nonclassical effects and entanglement in optical couplers @xcite , but except a recent study on codirectional nonlinear optical coupler reported by us @xcite , all the other efforts were limited to kerr nonlinear optical coupler .",
    "for example , in 2004 , leonski and miranowicz reported entanglement in kerr nonlinear optical coupler @xcite and pumped kerr nonlinear optical coupler @xcite , subsequently entanglement sudden death @xcite and thermally induced entanglement @xcite were reported in the same system .",
    "amplitude squared ( higher order ) squeezing was also reported in kerr nonlinear optical coupler @xcite .",
    "however , no effort has yet been made to rigorously study the higher order nonclassical effects and entanglement in contradirectional nonlinear optical coupler .",
    "keeping these facts in mind in the present letter we aim to study nonclassical effects ( including higher order nonclassicality and entanglement ) in contradirectional nonlinear optical coupler .",
    "remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : the - model - and ] , the model momentum operator that represents the asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler is described and perturbative solutions of equations of motion corresponding to different field modes present in the momentum operator are reported . in section [ sec : criteria - of - nonclassicalities ] , we briefly describe a set of criteria of nonclassicality . in section [ sec : nonclassicality - in - contradirectional ] the criteria described in the previous section are used to investigate the existence of different nonclassical characters ( e.g. , lower order and higher order squeezing , antibunching , and entanglement ) in various field modes present in the contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is dedicated for conclusions .",
    "a schematic diagram of a contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : schematic diagram ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic diagram ] one can easily observe that a linear waveguide is combined with a nonlinear @xmath10 waveguide to constitute the asymmetric coupler of our interest . further , from fig . [ fig : schematic diagram ] we can observe that in the linear waveguide field propagates in a direction opposite to the propagation direction of the field in the nonlinear waveguide . electromagnetic field characterized by the bosonic field annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath11 propagates through the linear waveguide .",
    "similarly , the field operators @xmath12 corresponds to the nonlinear medium .",
    "specifically , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote annihilation operators ( wave vectors ) for fundamental and second harmonic modes , respectively .",
    "now the momentum operator for contradirectional optical coupler is @xcite@xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the hermitian conjugate and @xmath17 represents the phase mismatch between the fundamental and second harmonic beams .",
    "the linear ( nonlinear ) coupling constant , proportional to susceptibility @xmath18 @xmath19 , is denoted by the parameter @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath22 as in a real physical system we usually obtain @xmath23 . as a consequence , in absence of a highly strong pump @xmath24 .",
    "earlier this model of contradirectional optical coupler was investigated by some of the present authors ( @xcite and references therein ) . using ( [ eq:1 ] ) and the procedure described in @xcite we can obtain the coupled differential equations for three different modes as follows @xmath25 here it would be apt to mention that momentum operator for contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear coupler ( [ eq:1 ] ) is same as that of codirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler @xcite . however , for the contradirectional couplers the sign of derivative in the heisenberg s equation of motion of the contra - propagating mode is changed ( i.e. , in the present case @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 as mode @xmath28 is considered here as the contra - propagating mode ) .",
    "the method used here to obtain ( [ eq : aaa ] ) is described in refs .",
    "@xcite . further , this particular description of contradirectional coupler is valid only for the situation when the forward propagating waves reach @xmath29 and the counter ( backward ) propagating wave reach @xmath30 .",
    "thus the coupled equations described by ( [ eq : aaa ] ) and their solution obtained below are not valid for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "earlier these coupled equations ( [ eq : aaa ] ) were solved under short - length approximation . here",
    "we aim to obtain perturbative solution for these equations using sen - mandal method which is already shown to be useful in detecting nonclassical characters not identified by short - length solution @xcite . keeping this in mind",

    "the fields involved are described by the corresponding annihilation operators , as shown ; @xmath33 is the interaction length . ]    using sen - mandal approach we have obtained closed form perturbative analytic solutions of ( [ eq : aaa ] ) as@xmath34 with@xmath35\\sinh|k|l\\right\\ } , \\\\",

    "the solution obtained above is verified by escr ( equal space commutation relation ) which implies @xmath38=\\left[b_{1}\\left(l\\right),b_{1}^{\\dagger}\\left(l\\right)\\right]=\\left[b_{2}\\left(l\\right),b_{2}^{\\dagger}\\left(l\\right)\\right]=1 $ ] while all other equal space commutations are zero .",
    "further , we have verified that the solutions reported here satisfies constant of motion . to be precise , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the constant of motion for the present system leads to @xmath39 here we have verified that the solution proposed here satisfies ( [ eq : const - of - motion ] ) .",
    "we have also verified that the solution of contradirectional coupler using short - length solution method reported in @xcite can be obtained as a special case of the present solution .",
    "specifically , to obtain the short - length solution we need to expand the trigonometric functions present in the above solution and neglect all the terms beyond quadratic powers of @xmath33 and consider phase mismatch @xmath40 .",
    "after doing so we obtain@xmath41 which coincides with the short - length solution reported earlier by some of the present authors @xcite .",
    "clearly the solution obtained here is valid and more general than the conventional short - length solution as the solution reported here is fully quantum solution and is valid for any length , restricting the coupling constant only .",
    "further , in case of codirectional optical coupler we have already seen that several nonclassical phenomena not identified by short - length solution are identified by the perturbative solution obtained by sen - mandal method @xcite . keeping this in mind , in what follows we investigate nonclassical characters of the fields that have propagated through a contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler .",
    "as the criteria for obtaining signatures of different nonclassical phenomena are expressed in terms of expectation values of functions of annihilation and creation operators of various modes , we can safely state that eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ eq : soln ] ) provide us sufficient resource for the investigation of the nonclassical phenomena . to illustrate this point",
    "we may note that the criteria for quadrature squeezing in single - mode ( @xmath42 and compound mode ( @xmath43 are @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the quadrature operators are defined as @xmath47 and @xmath48 similarly , the existence of single- and multi - mode nonclassical ( sub - poissonian ) photon statistics can be obtained through the following inequalities@xmath49 and @xmath50 where ( [ eq : antib-1 ] ) provides us the condition for single - mode antibunching and ( [ eq : antib2 ] ) provides us the condition for intermodal antibunching .",
    "many of the early investigations on nonclassicality were limited to the study of squeezing and antibunching only , but with the recent development of quantum computing and quantum information it has become very relevant to study entanglement .",
    "interestingly , there exist a large number of inseparability criteria ( @xcite and references therein ) that can be expressed in terms of expectation values of moments of field operators .",
    "for example , hillery - zubairy criterion i and ii ( hz - i and hz - ii ) @xcite are described as @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "another , interesting criterion of inseparability that can be expressed in terms of moments of creation and annihilation operators is duan et al.s criterion which is described as follows @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 clearly our analytic solution ( [ 2])-([eq : soln ] ) enables us to investigate intermodal entanglement using these criteria and a bunch of other criteria of nonclassicality that are described in ref .",
    "interestingly , all the inseparability criteria described above and in the remaining part of the present work can be viewed as special cases of shchukin - vogel entanglement criterion @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , miranowicz et al .",
    "have explicitly established this point .",
    "so far we have described criteria of nonclassicality that are related to the lowest order nonclassicality .",
    "however , nonclassicality may be witnessed via higher order criterion of nonclassicality , too .",
    "investigations on higher order nonclassical properties of various optical systems have been performed since long .",
    "for example , in late seventies some of the present authors showed the existence of higher order nonclassical photon statistics in different optical systems using criterion based on higher order moments of number operators ( cf .",
    "@xcite and chapter 10 of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , in those early works , higher order antibunching ( hoa ) was not specifically discussed , but existence of higher order nonclassical photon statistics was reported for degenerate and nondegenerate parametric processes in single and compound signal - idler modes , respectively and also for raman scattering in compound stokes - anti - stokes mode up to @xmath55 . criterion for hoa was categorically introduced by c. t. lee @xcite in 1990 . since then hoa is reported in several quantum optical systems ( @xcite and references therein ) and atomic systems @xcite . however , except a recent effort by us @xcite no effort has yet been made to study hoa in optical couplers .",
    "the existence of hoa can be witnessed through a set of equivalent but different criteria , all of which can be interpreted as modified lee criterion . in what follows",
    "we will investigate the existence of hoa in the contradirectional optical coupler of our interest using a simple criterion of @xmath56-th order single - mode antibunching introduced by some of us @xcite @xmath57 here @xmath58 and @xmath59 refer to the usual antibunching and the higher order antibunching , respectively .",
    "similarly , we can also investigate the existence of higher order squeezing , but definition of higher order squeezing is not unique . to be precise",
    ", it is usually investigated using two different criteria @xcite .",
    "the first criterion was introduced by hong and mandel in 1985 @xcite and a second criterion was subsequently introduced by hillery in 1987 @xcite . in hong and mandel criterion @xcite , the reduction of higher order moments of usual quadrature operators with respect to their coherent state counterparts",
    "are considered as higher order squeezing . however , in hillery s criterion , reduction of variance of an amplitude powered quadrature variable for a quantum state with respect to its coherent state counterpart is considered as higher order squeezing . in what follows",
    "we have restricted our study on higher order squeezing to hillery s criterion of amplitude powered squeezing .",
    "specifically , hillery introduced amplitude powered quadrature variables as @xmath60 and @xmath61 it is easy to check that @xmath62 and @xmath63 do not commute and consequently we can obtain an uncertainty relation and thus a criterion of @xmath64 order amplitude squeezing as@xmath65\\right\\rangle \\right|}{\\normalcolor < 0}}.}\\ ] ] thus , for the specific case , @xmath58 , hillery s criterion for amplitude squared squeezing can be obtained as @xmath66 where @xmath67 similarly , we can obtain specific criteria of amplitude powered squeezing for other values of @xmath68 further , there exists a set of higher order inseparability criteria . to be precise ,",
    "all the criteria that are used for witnessing the existence of multi - partite ( multi - mode ) entanglement are essentially higher order criteria @xcite as they always uncover some higher order correlation .",
    "interestingly , even in bipartite ( two - mode ) case one can introduce operational criterion for detection of higher order entanglement . for example , hillery - zubairy introduced following two criteria of higher order intermodal entanglement @xcite @xmath69 and@xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath56 are non - zero positive integers and the lowest possible values of @xmath71 and @xmath56 are @xmath72 which reduces ( [ hoe - criteria-1 ] ) and ( [ hoe - criteria-2 ] ) to usual hz - i criterion ( i.e. , ( [ hz1 ] ) ) and hz - ii criterion ( i.e. , ( [ hz2 ] ) ) , respectively .",
    "thus these two criteria may be viewed as generalized versions of the well known lower order criteria of hillery and zubairy ( i.e. , the criteria described in ( [ hz1 ] ) and ( [ hz2 ] ) ) . however , these generalized criterion can also be obtained as special cases of more general criterion of shchukin and vogel @xcite . for the convenience of the readers , we refer to ( [ hoe - criteria-1 ] ) and ( [ hoe - criteria-2 ] ) as hz - i criterion and hz - ii criterion respectively in analogy to the lowest order cases . in",
    "what follows , a quantum state will be called ( bipartite ) higher order entangled state if it is found to satisfy ( [ hoe - criteria-1 ] ) and/or ( [ hoe - criteria-2 ] ) for any choice of integers @xmath71 and @xmath56 satisfying @xmath73 existence of higher order entanglement can also be viewed through the criteria of multi - partite entanglement .",
    "for example , li et al .",
    "@xcite proved that a three - mode ( tripartite ) quantum state is not bi - separable in the form @xmath74 ( i.e. , compound mode @xmath75 is entangled with the mode @xmath8 ) if the following inequality holds for the three - mode system    @xmath76    where @xmath77 are positive integers and annihilation operators @xmath78 correspond to the three modes .",
    "a quantum state that satisfy ( [ eq : tripartite ent1 ] ) is referred to as @xmath74 entangled state .",
    "the three - mode inseparability criterion mentioned above is not unique .",
    "there exist various alternative criteria of three - mode entanglement .",
    "for example , an alternative criterion for detection of @xmath74 entangled state is @xcite @xmath79 for @xmath80 this criterion coincides with miranowicz et al.s criterion @xcite . using ( [ eq : tripartite ent1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tripartite ent2 ] ) , we can easily obtain criteria for detection of @xmath81 and @xmath82 entangled states and use them to obtain a simple criterion for detection of fully entangled tripartite state . specifically , using ( [ eq : tripartite ent1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tripartite ent2 ] ) respectively we can conclude that the three modes of our interest are not bi - separable in any form if one of the following two sets of inequalities are satisfied simultaneously @xmath83    @xmath84    further , for a fully separable pure state we always have @xmath85^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\label{eq : fully ent2}\\ ] ] thus , a three - mode pure state that violates ( [ eq : fully ent2 ] ) ( i.e. , satisfies @xmath86 and simultaneously satisfies either ( [ eq : fully enta 0 ] ) or ( [ eq : fully enta 1 ] ) is a fully entangled state as it is neither fully separable nor bi - separable in any form .",
    "spatial evolution of different operators that are relevant for witnessing nonclassicality can be obtained using the perturbative solutions ( [ 2])-([eq : soln ] ) reported here .",
    "for example , using ( [ 2])-([eq : soln ] ) we can obtain the following closed form expressions for number operators of various field modes @xmath87,\\end{array}\\label{eq : na}\\ ] ] @xmath88,\\end{array}\\label{eq : nb}\\ ] ] @xmath89.\\label{eq : nb2}\\ ] ] it is now straight forward to compute the average values of the number of photons in different modes with respect to a given initial state . in the present work we consider that the initial state is product of three coherent states : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are eigen kets of annihilation operators @xmath93 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
