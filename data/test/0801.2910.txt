    "for ultracold dilute non - relativistic bosons in three dimensions , bogoliubov theory gives a successful description of most quantities of interest @xcite .",
    "this approximation breaks down , however , near the critical temperature for the phase transition , as well as for the low temperature phase in lower dimensional systems , due to the importance of fluctuations .",
    "one would therefore like to have a systematic extension beyond the bogoliubov theory , which includes the fluctuation effects beyond the lowest order in a perturbative expansion in the scattering length .",
    "such extensions have encountered obstacles in the form of infrared divergences in various expansions @xcite . only recently , a satisfactory framework has been found to cure these problems @xcite .",
    "functional renormalization @xcite for the average action @xcite systematically copes with the infrared problems by exploring the difficult long range behavior gradually by means of non - perturbative flow equations , which are based on an exact renormalization group equation @xcite . for zero temperature",
    "they lead to a consistent description of bose - einstein condensation and the quantum phase transition for nonrelativistic bosons in arbitrary dimension @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient is the generation of a term in the inverse propagator that is quadratic in the frequency @xmath4 .",
    "it characterizes the long time behavior of the full propagator at long distances , even if no quadratic frequency dependence is present in the microphysical or classical propagator .",
    "the coupling @xmath5 is due to quantum fluctuations and appears during the flow from microphysics to macrophysics .",
    "the extreme infrared limit is governed by a `` relativistic '' model where @xmath5 dominates , with an enhanced ( approximate ) space - time symmetry @xmath6 corresponding to lorentz symmetry . in one or two dimensions",
    "the relativistic term @xmath7 in the inverse propagator is crucial for a correct description of the low temperature behavior .",
    "in contrast , in three dimensions the flow towards the extreme infrared behavior is only logarithmic , such that the quantitative influence remains quite moderate for practical purposes .",
    "nevertheless , the effective coupling @xmath5 is needed in order to avoid the infrared problems .    in this paper , we extend this formalism to a nonvanishing temperature",
    ". we present a quantitative rather accurate picture of bose - einstein condensation in three dimensions and find that the bogoliubov approximation is indeed valid for most quantities .",
    "the same method can be applied for one or two dimensions , such that the present work can also serve as a test of the method .",
    "this is nontrivial , because insufficient truncations of the flow equations can lead to fake dependencies on the microscopic physics .    for dilute non - relativistic bosons in three dimensions",
    "we find an upper bound on the scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the `` triviality bound '' for the higgs scalar in the standard model of elementary particle physics . as a consequence ,",
    "the scattering length is at most of the order of the inverse effective ultraviolet cutoff @xmath8 , which indicates the breakdown of the pointlike approximation for the interaction at short distances .",
    "typically , @xmath8 is of the order of the range of the van der waals interaction . for dilute gases , where the interparticle distance @xmath9 is much larger than @xmath8",
    ", we therefore always find a small concentration @xmath10 .",
    "this provides for a small dimensionless parameter , and perturbation theory in @xmath11 becomes rather accurate for most quantities . for typical experiments with ultracold bosonic alkali atoms",
    "one has @xmath12 , @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 is really quite small .",
    "bosons with pointlike interactions can also be employed for an effective description of many quantum phase transitions at zero temperature , or phase transitions at low temperature @xmath15 . in this case , they correspond to quasi - particles , and their dispersion relation may differ from the one of non - relativistic bosons , @xmath16 . we describe the quantum phase transitions for a general microscopic dispersion relation , where the inverse classical propagator in momentum and frequency space takes the form @xmath17 ( in units where the particle mass @xmath18 is set to @xmath19 ) .",
    "we present the quantum phase diagram at @xmath20 in dependence on the scattering length @xmath0 and a dimensionless parameter @xmath21 , which measures the relative strength of the term quadratic in @xmath22 in @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath24 ( @xmath25 )",
    "our model describes relativistic bosons .",
    "a nonzero temperature @xmath15 introduces a new scale into the problem .",
    "this modifies the effective scaling behavior .",
    "in particular , near the critical temperature @xmath2 , where the bose - einstein condensate dissolves , the long distance physics can be described by classical statistics .",
    "the non - relativistic bosons belong to the universality class of the three - dimensional @xmath26 model , with the associated universal critical exponents .",
    "the flow equations in the classical regime are well studied and lead , for an appropriate level of the truncation , to very accurate results for the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "here we use a rather simple truncation , but we obtain nevertheless a reasonable description of the non - analytical critical behavior . however , the temperature range for the applicability of the universal critical behavior is found to be very small for the small values of @xmath11 encountered for the dilute gases .",
    "the value of the critical temperature for interacting bosons can not be computed within the bogoliubov theory .",
    "we find a temperature shift @xmath3 , compared to the free theory .",
    "in contrast to other estimates , which only take the classical fluctuations into account ( only the zero matsubara frequency ) , we include the full quantum statistics ( all matsubara frequencies ) .",
    "we finally compute the sound velocity at @xmath20 .",
    "this quantity agrees to high precision with the bogoliubov result . for a known scattering length @xmath0",

    "many of our results can be translated to the inhomogeneous case in the framework of the local density approximation .",
    "one assumes that the length scale relevant for the quantum and statistical fluctuations is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the trap . in this case ,",
    "our results can be transferred by taking the chemical potential position dependent in the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the trapping potential .",

    "the situation is similar for galilean invariance . at zero temperature",
    ", we can perform an analytic continuation to real time and the microscopic action is then invariant under transformations that correspond to a change of the reference frame in the sense of a galilean boost .",
    "it is easy to see that in the phase with spontaneous @xmath46 symmetry breaking also the galilean symmetry is broken spontaneously : a condensate wave function , that is homogeneous in space and time , would be represented in momentum space by @xmath53 under a galilean boost transformation with a boost velocity @xmath54 , this would transform according to @xmath55 this shows that the ground state is not invariant under such a change of reference frame .",

    "<S> we investigate bose - einstein condensation for interacting bosons at zero and nonzero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> functional renormalization provides us with a consistent method to compute the effect of fluctuations beyond the bogoliubov approximation . for three - dimensional dilute gases </S>",
    "<S> , we find an upper bound on the scattering length @xmath0 which is of the order of the microphysical scale - typically the range of the van der waals interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to fermions near the unitary bound , no strong interactions occur for bosons with approximately pointlike interactions , thus explaining the high quantitative reliability of perturbation theory for most quantities . for zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> we compute the quantum phase diagram for bosonic quasiparticles with a general dispersion relation , corresponding to an inverse microphysical propagator with terms linear and quadratic in the frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the temperature dependence of the condensate and particle density @xmath1 , and find for the critical temperature @xmath2 a deviation from the free theory , @xmath3 . for the sound velocity at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> we find very good agreement with the bogoliubov result , such that it may be used to determine the particle density accurately . </S>"
