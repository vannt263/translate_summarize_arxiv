    "note also , that the pure chiral strings , containing modes of only one direction , can not exist and any chiral string has to be connected to some object containing an anti - chiral part .",
    "indeed , the pure chiral excitation depends only on one of the parameters @xmath101 , and as a result the world - sheet is degenerated in a world - line .",
    "this is seen in the models of the cosmic chiral strings where the chiral excitations are joined to some mass @xcite or are sitting on some string having modes of opposite chirality @xcite . in our case",
    "the partial pp - wave e.m .",
    "excitation has the same chirality as the half - infinite carrier of this excitation ( the axial ray of pnc ) .",
    "therefore , the combination of two @xmath99 excitations looks very natural and leads to the appearance of a full stringy system with two half - infinite singular d - strings of opposite chirality , `` left '' and `` right '' , as it is shown at the fig.1 .",
    "the world - sheet of the system containing from two straight chiral strings will be given by x^(t , z)=12 [ ( t - z)k_r^ + ( t+z)k_l^ ] , [ astr ] where the lightlike vectors @xmath6 are constant and normalized .",
    "at the rest frame the timelike components are equal @xmath102 , and the spacelike components are oppositely directed , @xmath103 therefore , @xmath104 and @xmath105 and the nambu - goto string action s=^-1 dtdz can be expressed via @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    to normalize the infinite string we have to perform a renormalization putting @xmath108 which yields the usual action for the center of mass of a pointlike particle s= mdt .    for the system of",

    "however , one of the most important arguments in favor of the combination of two chiral strings is suggested by analogue to the dirac equation , which has to be obtained for the kerr spinning particle if it has a relation to the structure of electron .",
    "it is known that in the weyl basis the dirac current can be represented as a sum of two lightlike components of opposite chirality j_= e ( | _ ) = e ( ^+ _ + ^+ |^ ) , where @xmath111 and |=(^+ , ^+ ) [ barpsi ] two real lightlike 4-vectors @xmath112 can be expressed in spinor form k_l^ = ^+ |^k_r^ = ^+ ^ , and two extra complex null vectors can be formed m^",
