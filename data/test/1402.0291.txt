    "gamma - ray astronomy has rapidly grown in recent years thanks to the development of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , which are able to observe gamma rays at very high energies ( vhe ; @xmath1 gev ) , such as the high energy gamma - ray spectroscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( magic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) telescopes , and the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ; * ? ? ?",
    "space telescopes observing in the gev energy band such as the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite have also substantially contributed to progress in the field .",
    "vhe photons , with energies above a characteristic energy , are strongly attenuated through electron - positron pair creation in the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "this characteristic ebl absorption energy is defined by the photon energy at which the pair creation optical depth is unity .",
    "the characteristic energy depends on the source s redshift .",
    "the attenuation results in a much softer spectrum at earth than that of the intrinsic spectrum of a source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic energy is lower for sources with higher redshift .",
    "thus , the detection of vhe gamma rays from distant sources is a challenge for iacts . on the other hand",
    ", this absorption process brings a unique opportunity to study the ebl ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is difficult to be measured directly due to strong galactic foregrounds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ebl is mainly interpreted as stellar and dust emission integrated over the cosmic history .",
    "therefore , vhe gamma - ray observations can be used to extract information on the imprinted cosmic stellar and galaxy evolution .",
    "observations of vhe gamma - ray sources with different redshifts allow us to investigate the ebl in different wavelengths and hence to examine underlying astrophysics and cosmology at different epochs .",
    "in particular , vhe gamma - ray observations of bl lac objects at @xmath10 have constrained ebl models from optical to infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most distant object ever detected in the vhe energy range , with firmly confirmed redshift , is the flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) 3c 279 ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this source has also been utilized to constrain ebl models on the assumption that the intrinsic power - law index in the vhe range is softer than @xmath12 .",
    "recently , two sources with possibly higher redshifts have been detected , namely kuv 00311 - 1938 @xcite with @xmath13 @xcite and pks 1424 + 240 with @xmath14 @xcite , but they have not been used to estimate the ebl density due to the uncertainty in their redshift measurements .",
    "moreover , different authors have recently claimed the detection of the ebl imprint by the statistical analyses of the spectra of blazars .",
    "in particular , the analysis of @xcite covers the wide redshift range ( @xmath15 ) using lat data .",
    "focus on lower redshift blazars detected by h.e.s.s .",
    "( @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xcite use the multi - wavelength data of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars to estimate the cosmic gamma - ray horizon from the local universe to @xmath17 by using an ebl - model - independent technique .",
    "although the lat has unveiled the ebl at high redshifts ( @xmath18 ) , the detection of sources with high redshifts in the vhe range allows us to test different ( longer than in the lat energy range ) wavelengths of the ebl which have not yet been investigated .",
    "the magic telescopes have achieved an analysis energy threshold below 100 gev , and therefore are an ideally suited instrument among existing iacts to study high - redshift sources .",
    "in this paper we report the observational results of the distant quasar 4c + 55.17 ( @xmath0 ) by the magic telescopes .",
    "this source was recognized as a promising high - redshift candidate for vhe emission from the first lat agn catalog ( 1lac ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , 4c + 55.17 was also identified as a good source candidate for vhe detection by the _",
    "lat collaboration in a dedicated high - energy data analysis ( private communication , september 2010 ) , and by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum in the lat energy range is hard and consistent with a power - law @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the range from @xmath6 mev to @xmath6 gev , not showing significant flux variability in the 1lac @xcite .",
    "the spectral hardness of gamma - ray sources is particularly important to study the ebl because of the limited sensitivities of iacts ; harder sources can provide more photons with energies above the characteristic ebl absorption energy , allowing for studies with better precision .",
    "even with a spectral break at the energy of several gev recently reported @xcite this source is still a good candidate for a distant vhe gamma - ray emitter .",
    "this source is a radio - loud active galaxy with the firmly confirmed redshift of @xmath0 estimated from broad optical emission lines in its spectrum @xcite .",
    "it had been categorized as a fsrq , but interestingly the classification has recently been questioned due to its morphological and spectroscopic properties which are distinct from those of other fsrqs @xcite .",
    "fsrqs are characterized by a centrally concentrated radio core with high brightness temperature and highly variable flux .",
    "however , the brightness temperature of this source is @xmath21 k at 5 ghz @xcite , which is much lower than that of the other known quasar - hosted gamma - ray blazars @xcite , and a light curve in the lat energy range is consistent with steady emission @xcite .",
    "note that only strong variability can be significantly detected due to the limited number of detected photons by the lat .",
    "radio morphology has indicated that 4c + 55.17 belongs to a family of young radio galaxies , that is , compact symmetric objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , which are a smaller version of classical fanaroff - riley ( fr ) ii radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the low flux variability of this source also supports this indication .",
    "importantly , this type of compact objects is a promising source candidate of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays @xcite similarly to the lobes of fr ii radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite model the multi - wavelength sed of this source by using both compact symmetric object and fsrq interpretations .",
    "the authors suggest that infrared and hard x - ray observations can help to distinguish between the two models , but vhe gamma rays also provide a clue for the distinction despite the significant ebl absorption .",
    "also , a hadronic interpretation predicts a hard intrinsic spectrum in the vhe range @xcite .",
    "therefore , observations of this source in the vhe range can provide an important clue to its nature and radiation mechanism .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows .",
    "we describe the details of the magic observations and data analysis in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "then , results are shown in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "implications from the results are discussed in section [ sec : dis ] and a summary is presented in section [ sec : sum ] .",

    "the magic telescopes have been operating in stereoscopic mode since the end of 2009 , which provided an analysis energy threshold below @xmath6 gev and an integral sensitivity of @xmath24 of the crab nebula flux above 300 gev for 50-hour observations @xcite .    4c + 55.17",
    "was observed from november 2010 to january 2011 for 21 dark nights and a total of 35 hours in stereoscopic mode .",
    "the data were taken at medium zenith angles ( from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) to achieve an energy threshold below @xmath6 gev .",
    "the observations were performed in the so - called wobble mode @xcite ; i.e. the target source direction has the offset of @xmath27 from the camera centre , allowing for taking both signal and background data simultaneously .",
    "the observations were performed with two pointing directions ; slightly off - sources at the same declination as the source but at an angular distance of @xmath28 degree in right ascension .",
    "the direction of the wobble offset is inverted every 20 minutes to minimize systematic errors originating from possible exposure inhomogeneities .",
    "data were selected based on the rate of background events being in a regular range for magic observations .",
    "the data selection yielded @xmath29 hours of effective time .",
    "those data were analyzed following the standard procedure @xcite with the magic analysis and reconstruction software ( mars ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the analysis cuts to extract gamma - ray signals from the hadronic background were optimized independently of these observational data by means of data from crab nebula and dedicated monte - carlo simulations of gamma - ray induced showers .",
    "an initial check of the energy threshold , for these observations , were made using monte - carlo simulations of gamma - ray induced showers .",
    "we selected monte - carlo events simulated under an assumed spectrum following the telescope responses after application of the same experimental cuts that were applied to the data , and made the histogram of the events as a function of input energies .",
    "the energy at the maximum of the histogram is defined as the analysis threshold .",
    "this is the standard definition of the analysis threshold for iacts .",
    "we assume the incident gamma - ray spectrum to be a power - law with index @xmath30 .",
    "this is expected by the lat spectrum and plausible ebl models at around 100 gev .",
    "note that the spectral index of the lat spectrum above @xmath31 gev ( up to @xmath32 gev ) is @xmath33 in @xcite and the spectrum above @xmath34 gev can be characterized with a power - law function of @xmath35 @xcite . as a result , the energy threshold was found to be @xmath36 gev . a gamma - ray signal from 4c + 55.17 was searched for following the standard method using the so - called @xmath37 distribution , i.e. , a distribution of the squared angular distance between the reconstructed arrival directions of the events and the source nominal position @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 distributions of the observed data with the corresponding energy threshold of @xmath6 gev ( i.e. , images with the total number of reconstructed photoelectrons @xmath38 in each telescope ) , shown in figure [ fig : theta2 ] , indicate no significant excess of gamma rays compared to background in the direction of 4c + 55.17 .",

    "the magic upper limit is slightly lower than the upper limit of veritas due to the longer observation time ; the veritas observations were performed for 17.7 hours .",
    "further observations with veritas ( for a total observation time of 45 hours , furniss & mcconville 2013 ) , resulting in a more constraining upper limit above @xmath44 gev .",
    "thanks to the lower energy threshold of magic here we report an upper limit at lower energies .",
    "we calculate differential upper limits in the 4 energy bins of equal width in logarithmic scale in the energy range between @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 gev .",
    "the spectral indices of the gamma - ray distributions were assumed to be @xmath30 in the first bin and @xmath45 in the other following bins because of a sharp cutoff at @xmath36 gev predicted from recent ebl models ( e.g. , franceschini , rodighiero , & vaccari 2008 ; domnguez et al .",

    "the upper limits on the flux depend on the assumed spectral indices for gamma - ray spectra . in order to evaluate the uncertainty of the upper limits due to this dependence",
    ", we calculate the upper limits on the assumption of harder spectra by one unit , i.e. , the spectral index of @xmath47 for integral upper limits , and @xmath47 in the first bin and @xmath30 in the following bins for differential limits . as a result ,",
    "the integral upper limits change by less than @xmath48 for both @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev . on the other hand , the resultant differential upper limits",
    "change within @xmath51 in the three high - energy bins and by about a factor of two in the first bin .",
    "the latter is because of a rapid change of collection area as a function of gamma - ray energy .",
    "the collection area of iacts depends strongly on the primary gamma - ray energy .",
    "the average number of cherenkov photons is smaller for lower energy gamma rays , making it less probable to trigger iacts even if the shower falls within the light pool .",
    "this results in a very steep collection area around the energy threshold , and therefore strong dependence on the collection area in a finite energy bin on the assumed spectral shape .        .",
    "there is no significant signal in the direction of 4c + 55.17 ( _ cross _ ) . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we interpret the derived upper limits of the gamma - ray flux with low - flux ebl models @xcite .",
    "note that low - flux means that the flux in the ebl models are close to that given by galaxy counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a recent study shows that the lat spectrum of 4c + 55.17 up to @xmath52 gev can be well fit by a broken power - law function with a break at @xmath53 gev and @xmath33 above the break ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ fig : ebl ] ) .",
    "we adopt this result and assume simple spectral extension beyond the characteristic ebl absorption energy ( @xmath36 gev ) up to 1 tev .",
    "this can be considered to give a plausible upper limit of the intrinsic spectrum unless another new component dominates above @xmath32 gev .",
    "the assumed maximum energy up to which the source emits gamma rays is not important for our analysis because secondary photons created in electromagnetic cascades between the source and the observer will not contribute to the gamma - ray flux significantly due to the intrinsic spectral index softer than 2 .",
    "figure [ fig : ebl ] shows our differential upper limits and the fitted spectra corrected for ebl attenuation .",
    "the latter were calculated according to four low - flux ebl models @xcite .",
    "the upper limits are close to the attenuated power - law spectra and interestingly the upper limit at @xmath54 gev is slightly below the predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this strong upper limit was possible thanks to the low energy threshold of the magic telescopes .",
    "however , we note that the flux should be regarded as consistent with the upper limit because of the dependence of the chosen binning and the statistical errors involved in the spectral fit of the lat data .",
    "the integral upper limits above @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 gev provides similar results .",
    "thus , the power - law extension is consistent with the magic upper limits under the low - flux ebl models ( and also higher - flux ebl models not shown ) .",
    "given the redshift of 4c + 55.17 ( @xmath0 ) , the energies of our upper limits ( @xmath36 gev ) , and the properties of the pair production interaction , the gamma - ray photons that we are discussing are mainly attenuated by ebl photons in the ultraviolet range .",
    "the sed of 4c + 55.17 can be modeled by both an external compton model for blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and emission from compact radio lobes @xcite .",
    "spectral modeling in @xcite indicates that the compact lobe model predicts a power - law spectrum above several gev up to several hundred gev , while the blazar model has a sharp spectral steepening at several gev .",
    "thus , the simple power - law intrinsic spectrum extended above @xmath6 gev is an optimistic model . since the simple power - law spectrum is allowed even for the low - flux ebl models , both models are still consistent with the upper limits .",
    "stronger upper limits or detection in the future will allow us to test the compact symmetric object model under the low - flux ebl models .",
    "the magic telescopes observed 4c + 55.17 for @xmath55 hours ( @xmath29 hours of effective time with good quality data ) from november 2010 to january 2011 in a wobble mode .",
    "no significant gamma - ray signal was found above @xmath6 gev . instead , both integral and differential upper limits of gamma - ray flux were derived .",
    "the integral upper limits are @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 s@xmath4 above @xmath6 gev and @xmath5 @xmath3 s@xmath4 above @xmath7 gev .",
    "the differential upper limits are tabulated in table [ tab : difful ] .",
    "the derived limits are close to and consistent with the power - law spectrum extended from the lat energy range attenuated by low - flux ebl models .",
    "@xcite claimed that a 50-hour observation with magic would suffice to detect this source .",
    "however , the strict upper limits from @xmath56 hours of observation do not confirm this prediction , due to the medium zenith angle of the observations ( @xmath57 ) , which increases the analysis threshold and suppress the performance at lowest energies @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to our estimates , magic would require @xmath36 hours in order to have a @xmath58 detection from 4c + 55.17 under the optimistic assumption of the power - law extension adopted in this study and relatively optically - thin ebl models such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after the observation of 4c + 55.17 , the camera of the magic i telescope was upgraded , which improved the sensitivity for the lowest energies @xcite . a new trigger system for stereoscopic observations , so - called sum - trigger @xcite , will improve the sensitivity below @xmath6 gev significantly .",
    "these may help detect this source in the vhe range .",
    "detailed studies on its spectrum beyond detection would require a sensitivity several times better than current ground - based gamma - ray instruments , and hence it may be a task for the next generation of instruments such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ; * ? ? ?",
