    "tilings are studied by mathematicians , physicists and material scientists . to a physicist ,",
    "an aperiodic tiling , such as the penrose tiling , is a model for a form of matter that is neither crystaline nor disordered .",
    "the most interesting questions are then about the physical properties of the material being modeled :    p1 . what is the x - ray diffraction pattern of the material",
    "this is equivalent to the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the positions of the atoms .",
    "sharp peaks are the hallmark of ordered materials , such as crystals and quasicrystals .",
    "what are the possible energy levels of electrons in the material ?",
    "the locations of the atoms determine a quasiperiodic potential , and the spectrum of the corresponding schrdinger hamiltonian has infinitely many gaps .",
    "what are the energies of these gaps , and what is the density of states corresponding to each gap ?",
    "can you really tell the internal structure of the material from diffraction data ?",
    "what deformations ( either local or non - local ) of the molecular structure are consistent with the combinatorics of the molecular bonds ? which of these are detectable from diffraction data ?    as an example of p3 , consider the tilings in figure 1 .",
    "the first is a piece of the standard penrose ( rhomb ) tiling , with each rhomb cut into two triangles .",
    "the second tiling is combinatorially identical to the first , but the shapes and sizes of the ( 40 ) different species of tiles have been changed . in the first tiling ,",
    "the diffraction pattern has rotational symmetry , since the underlying tiling has symmetry . in the second tiling",
    ", the vertices all lie on lattice points , so the diffraction pattern is periodic with period @xmath0 .",
    "however , we will see that the diffraction peaks of the two tilings are related by a simple linear transformation .",
    "in other words , the first tiling and a linear transformation of the second have very different geometry but qualitatively similar diffraction patterns .",
    "a mathematician takes a different approach to tilings . to a mathematician ,",
    "a tiling @xmath1 is a point in a tiling space @xmath2 .",
    "the other points of @xmath2 are tilings with the same properties as @xmath1 ( see the construction below ) .",
    "if @xmath1 has nice properties ( finite local complexity , repetitivity , well - defined patch frequencies ) , then @xmath2 will have nice properties ( compactness , minimality as a dynamical system , unique ergodicity ) , and we can ask the following mathematical questions :    m1 . what is the topology of @xmath2 ? what does the neighborhood of a point of @xmath2 look like ? what are the ( ech ) cohomology groups of @xmath2 ?",
    "there is a natural action of the group @xmath3 of translations on @xmath2 .",
    "this makes @xmath2 into a dynamical system , with @xmath4 commuting flows .",
    "what are the ergodic measures on @xmath2 ? for each such measure , what is the spectrum of the generator of translations ( think : momentum operator ) on @xmath5 ?",
    "this is called the _ dynamical spectrum _ of @xmath2 .    m3 . from the action of the translation group on @xmath2",
    ", one can construct a @xmath6 algebra .",
    "what is the k - theory of this @xmath6-algebra ?",
    "remarkably , each math question about @xmath2 answers a physics question about a material modeled on @xmath1 .",
    "m1 answers p3 , m2 answers p1 , and m3 ( in large part ) answers p2 . in this paper we will review the construction of @xmath2 and explain the connection between m1 and p3 , relying on @xcite for details and proofs .",
    "the connection between dynamical and diffraction spectrum is an old story , and we refer the reader to @xcite . for the relation between k - theory and gap - labeling ( i.e. , the density of states associated to gaps ) see @xcite .",
    "a point in our tiling space will be a tiling of @xmath3 ( for simplicity , we ll stick with @xmath7 , but the construction is the same in all dimensions ) . note that @xmath8 is nt just a plane  it is a plane with a distinguished point , namely the origin .",
    "translating the tiling to the right is equivalent to moving the origin to the left , _ and results in a different tiling_. the orbit of @xmath1 is the set of all translates of @xmath1 .",
    "we put a metric on tilings as follows .",
    "we say two tilings @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11-close if they agree on a ball of radius @xmath12 around the origin , up to a further translation by @xmath11 or less .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are translates of @xmath1 , this implies that a ball of radius @xmath12 around @xmath15 in @xmath1 looks just like a ball of radius @xmath12 around @xmath16 .",
    "the space @xmath2 is the completion of the orbit of @xmath1 in this metric .",
    "put another way , it is the set of tilings @xmath17 with the property that every patch of @xmath17 can be found somewhere in @xmath1 .",
    "other names for @xmath2 are the _ continuous hull of @xmath1 _ and the _ local isomorphism class of @xmath1_.    the first topological question is whether @xmath2 is compact .",
    "if @xmath1 has an infinite number of tile types , or if the tiles can fit together in an infinite variety of ways ( e.g. , a continuous shear along a common edge ) , then it is easy to construct a sequence of tilings whose behavior at the origin never settles down , and which therefore does not have a convergent subsequence .",
    "however , if @xmath1 has only a _",
    "finite _ number of tile types , and these tiles only fit together in only a finite number of ways , then there are only a finite number of patterns ( up to translation ) that can appear in a fixed region .",
    "this is called _ finite local complexity _ , or flc . if @xmath1 is an flc tiling , then any sequence of translates of @xmath1 has a subsequence that converges on a ball of radius 1 around the origin .",
    "that sequence has a subsequence that converges on a ball of radius 2 , etc . using a cantor diagonalization argument",
    ", we can easily produce a subsequence that converges everywhere .",
    "in other words , we have proved that    the tiling space @xmath2 is compact if and only if @xmath1 has finite local complexity .",
    "every flc tiling space is mld - equivalent ( see below ) to a tiling space where the tiles are polygons that meet full - edge to full - edge .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of the derived voronoi tilings that accomplish this equivalence . ) without loss of generality , then , we can restrict our attention to tilings of this sort .",
    "a tiling @xmath1 is called _ repetitive _ if , for every patch @xmath18 in @xmath1 , there is a radius @xmath19 such that every ball of radius @xmath19 contains at least one copy of @xmath18 .",
    "this guarantees that every tiling @xmath20 contains the patch @xmath18 , hence that the set of patches of @xmath17 is exactly the same as the set of patches of @xmath1 , and hence that @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , there is nothing special about @xmath1 itself , and the entire tiling space can be recovered from any tiling in the space .",
    "equivalently , the orbit of every tiling @xmath20 is dense in @xmath2 . in dynamical systems",
    "language , the tiling dynamical system @xmath2 is _",
    "minimal_.    if @xmath1 is a periodic tiling ( e.g. , a checkerboard ) , invariant under translation by a lattice @xmath22 , then it is easy to see that @xmath2 is the torus @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath2 is totally non - periodic , meaning there are _ no _ vectors @xmath24 for which @xmath25 , then @xmath2 is much more complicated . also much more interesting .",
    "locally , @xmath2 looks like a disk crossed with a totally disconnected set . by definition , if @xmath20 , then an @xmath11-neighborhood of @xmath17 is all tilings that agree with a small translate of @xmath17 on a ball of radius @xmath12 .",
    "this gives @xmath26 continuous degrees of freedom ( the small translations ) , and a number of discrete degrees of freedom ( choices on how to extend the tiling beyond the @xmath12 ball ) .",
    "if the original tiling @xmath1 is repetitive and non - periodic , then there are infinitely many discrete degrees of freedom , and the discrete choices yield a cantor set .    to somebody who is used to smooth manifolds , a set that is locally a disk crossed with a cantor set",
    "is bizarre .",
    "for instance @xmath2 is connected ( since it has a path - connected dense set , namely the orbit of @xmath1 ) but not path - connected ( since the path component of @xmath1 is merely the orbit of @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , such structures are common in dynamical systems .",
    "there are several important notions of equivalence for tiling spaces .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath1 be different tilings .",
    "we say that @xmath27 and @xmath2 are _ topologically conjugate _ if there is a continuous map @xmath28 , with a continuous inverse , that commutes with translations . as dynamical systems ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath27 then have identical properties .",
    "in particular , they have the same mixing properties and the same dynamical spectrum .",
    "an even stronger equivalence is _ mutual local derivability _ , or mld .",
    "we say that @xmath27 and @xmath2 are mld if they are topologically conjugate and the map @xmath29 is local .",
    "that is , if there exists a radius @xmath30 such that , when @xmath31 agree exactly on a ball of radius @xmath30 around a point @xmath15 , then @xmath32 and @xmath33 agree exactly on a ball of radius 1 around @xmath15 .",
    "we shall see that the two tiling spaces of figure 1 are topologically conjugate ( up to a fixed linear transformation ) , but not mld .",
    "one way to get a handle on tiling spaces is via inverse limits .",
    "if @xmath34 are topological spaces and @xmath35 are continuous maps , then the _ inverse limit space _",
    "@xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 in other words , a point in @xmath36 is a point @xmath38 , together with a point @xmath39 that maps to @xmath40 , together with a point @xmath41 that maps to @xmath42 , and so on .",
    "two sequences are considered close if their first @xmath43 terms are close , for @xmath43 large .",
    "the space @xmath44 is called the _ @xmath45-th approximant _ to @xmath44 , @xmath46 determines @xmath47 ,    a simple example of an inverse limit is when each @xmath44 is the circle @xmath48 and each @xmath49 is multiplication by 2 .",
    "this is called the _",
    "dyadic solenoid_. for each @xmath50 , there are two possibilities for @xmath42 , for each of these there are two possibilities for @xmath51 , for each of these there are two possibilities for @xmath52 , and so on .",
    "the points within @xmath11 of @xmath53 can differ by a continuous motion ( adding @xmath54 to @xmath40 , @xmath55 to @xmath42 , @xmath56 to @xmath51 , and so on ) , or by keeping the first @xmath43 terms the same and then making arbitrary choices for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc .",
    "this is exactly the same local structure as a 1-dimensional tiling space , namely one continuous degree of freedom and infinitely many discrete possibilities .",
    "a nice property of inverse limit spaces is that their ( ech ) cohomologies are easy to compute .",
    "the cohomology of the _ inverse _ limit is the _ direct _ limit of the cohomologies of the approximants : @xmath59 for the dyadic solenoid , each @xmath44 has @xmath60 .",
    "the pullback map @xmath61 is multiplication by 1 on @xmath62 and multiplication by 2 on @xmath63 , so the dyadic solenoid has @xmath64 , @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "that is , @xmath63 is the set of rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2 .",
    "most computations of the cohomology of tiling spaces use inverse limits and equation ( 2 ) @xcite .",
    "however , for certain `` cut - and - project '' tilings , other techniques have been developed @xcite .",
    "spaces of tilings can always be viewed as inverse limits .",
    "anderson and putnam @xcite first observed this for substitution tilings .",
    "others extended the idea to larger classes of tiling space @xcite .",
    "the following general construction is due to ghler @xcite , and was further generalized in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a tiling with finite local complexity , then @xmath2 is the inverse limit of a sequence of compact branched surfaces @xmath34 and continuous maps @xmath35 .",
    "a point in @xmath44 will be a set of instructions for placing a tile containing the origin , a ring of tiles around it ( the _ first corona _ ) , a second ring around that , and on out to the @xmath45-th corona .",
    "the map @xmath66 simply forgets the outermost corona .",
    "a sequence @xmath67 is then a consistent set of instructions for tiling larger and larger regions of the plane , which is tantamount to the tiling itself .",
    "consider two tiles @xmath68 in ( possibly different ) tilings in @xmath2 to be equivalent if a patch of the first tiling , containing @xmath69 and its first @xmath45 coronas , is identical , up to translation , to a patch of the second tiling containing @xmath70 and its first @xmath45 coronas . by finite local complexity",
    ", there are only finitely many equivalence clases , which we call @xmath45-collared tiles .    for each @xmath45-collared tile @xmath71",
    ", we consider how such a tile can be placed at the origin .",
    "this merely means picking a point in @xmath71 to sit at the origin .",
    "hence the set of all possible instructions for placing @xmath71 over the origin is just @xmath71 itself !",
    "a patch of a tiling in which the origin is on the boundary of two or more tiles is described by points on the boundary of two or more cells , and these points must be identified .",
    "the branched manifold @xmath44 is then the union of all the @xmath45-collared tiles @xmath71 , modulo this identification .",
    "since we are using @xmath45-collared tiles , each of the points being identified carries complete information about the pacement of the tiles touching the origin , plus their first @xmath72 coronas .",
    "this completes the construction .",
    "since we assumed our tiles to be polygons , describing the shape and size of a tile means specifying the displacement vector corresponding to each edge of the polygon .",
    "for instance , the shape of a triangle is determined by three vectors that add up to zero . if , somewhere in a tiling , tiles @xmath69 and @xmath70 meet along a common edge , then the edge of @xmath69 and the matching edge of @xmath70 must have exactly the same displacement vector .",
    "furthermore , the sum of all displacement vectors for the edges of @xmath71 must add up to zero .",
    "that is , the shapes of the tiles are determined by a function @xmath73 from the set of tile edges , modulo certain identifications , to @xmath8 .",
    "but the set of tiles , modulo these identifications , is precisely the approximant @xmath74 ! in other words ,",
    "a shape is a vector - valued 1-cochain on @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that the sum of the vectors around a tile add to zero means that this is a _ closed _ cochain .",
    "we can consider slightly more general deformations , where the new shape of a tile depends not only on its type but on the types of its nearest neighbors . in that case",
    "the shape is a vector - valued closed 1-cochain on @xmath75 . for maximum generality , we may allow closed 1-cochains on any approximant @xmath44 .",
    "not all deformations are interesting .",
    "if the 1-cochain is @xmath4 of a 0-cochain on @xmath44 , then the resulting tiling space is mld to the original one @xcite .",
    "our deformations , up to mld equivalence , are then described by closed 1-cochains modulo exact 1-cochains , i.e. , by the first cohomology of @xmath44 with values in @xmath8 .",
    "since we can take @xmath45 arbitrarily large , this means we want an element of the direct limit .",
    "but that s precisely the cohomology of @xmath2 itself .",
    "in other words ,      topological conjugacy is subtler .",
    "some cohomology classes are _ asymptotically negligible _ , meaning they represent deformations that do not change the topological conjugacy class of a tiling space . for general tiling spaces these classes",
    "can be difficult to compute , but for substitution tilings ( such as penrose ) they are easy .",
    "the substitution defines a map @xmath77 .",
    "this induces a pullback map @xmath78 .",
    "the eigenspaces of @xmath79 whose eigenvalues have magnitude strictly less than 1 are asymptotically negligible .",
    "[ cs ]    for the penrose tiling , @xmath80 is 10-dimensional .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath79 are the golden mean @xmath81 , with multiplicity 4 , @xmath82 with multiplicity 4 , and @xmath83 with multiplicity 2 .",
    "the 4-dimensional @xmath84 eigenspace describe the 4-dimensional space of linear transformations ( rotations , stretches and shears ) that could be applied uniformly to the tiling .",
    "the @xmath83 eigenspace breaks the ( statistical ) 180-degree rotational symmetry of the penrose system , and the @xmath82 eigenspace is asymptotically negligible .",
    "since the second tiling in figure 1 preserves the 180-degree rotational symmetry , its shape must be described by a combination of @xmath84 and @xmath82 eigenenvectors , while the shape of the original penrose tiling is entirely a @xmath84 eigenvector .",
    "thus the second tiling space is topologically conjugate ( but not mld ! ) to a linear transformation applied to the first .",
    "topological conjugacies preserve the dynamical spectrum , and therefore preserve locations ( but not necessarily intensities ) of the peaks of the diffraction pattern . as a result",
    ", the locations of the bragg peaks of the second tiling are related to the bragg peaks of the first tiling by a linear transformation .",
