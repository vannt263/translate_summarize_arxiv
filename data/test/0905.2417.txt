    "the discovery of a bright gamma - ray burst ( grb ) , 080916c , by the recently launched fermi satellite is an important advance toward our understanding of these spectacular explosions .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the fermi satellite can detect photons in the energy range from 20mev to @xmath0300gev ( hereafter we will call it the lat band ) .",
    "lat observed photons of energy up to 13 gev from grb 080916c where the flux was close to the threshold of its sensitivity ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) , and this detection suggests that the lorentz factor of the outflow in this explosion was @xmath2 ( greiner et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "a number of different proposals have been put forward for the generation of high energy photons in grbs .",
    "for instance , one possible mechanism is the synchrotron process  either electron or proton synchrotron ",
    "e.g. meszaros & rees ( 1994 ) , totani ( 1998 ) , zhang & meszaros ( 2001 ) .",
    "another possibility is inverse - compton scattering of lower energy photons produced in the same region ( such as the synchrotron - self - compton process ) or of an external origin e.g. meszaros & rees ( 1994 ) , pilla & loeb ( 1998 ) , dermer et al .",

    ". please see fan & piran ( 2008 ) for a review of the extensive literature on high energy photon generation processes .    in this _",
    "letter _ we provide multiple lines of evidence that show that high energy photons and late time x - ray and optical afterglow emissions from grb 080916c were produced via the electron synchrotron process in the external shock ; lower energy photons ( @xmath3mev ) had a different origin . in the next section",
    "we provide a summary of the observed data for grb 080916c . in  3 we describe the expected high energy emission from the external shock and compare that with the data for grb 080916c , and in  4 we show that the entire optical and x - ray afterglow data for this burst is consistent with the external shock model .",
    "moreover , using the external shock parameters determined from the late afterglow data alone ( @xmath4day ) we show that the expected emission at @xmath5mev during the prompt phase is entirely in agreement with the observed fermi / lat data (  4 ) .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "grb 080916c was detected by fermi ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) in the energy band @xmath68kev13gev .",
    "the spectrum of grb 080916c peaked at @xmath7 kev ; the flux was independent of frequency below the peak , i.e. @xmath8 , whereas above the peak a single power - law function , @xmath9 , extending from @xmath7 kev to 13 gev provided a good fit to the data ( time dependences of these quantities can be found in fig . 3 of abdo et al .",
    "the electron energy distribution index ( @xmath10 ) corresponding to this spectrum was 2.4 .",
    "the lat band photon flux rose as @xmath11 during the first 4s of observations ( the time is measured starting from the first detection of photons in the 8kev10mev band ) , and declined as @xmath12 from 4s to 1400s .",
    "the light curve for lower energy photons on the other hand declined as @xmath13 for the initial 55s , and subsequently it underwent a steep decline of @xmath14 which is often seen in the sub - mev band of grbs ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 , nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) and marks the end of the emission activity of the source .",
    "thus , photons of energy @xmath5mev lagged lower energy photons by 4s , and that is an important discovery by fermi .",
    "the other puzzling discovery is that radiation in the lat band lasts for a much longer duration of time than lower energy emission .",
    "x - ray and optical observations began about 1 day after the trigger time .",
    "optical observations allowed to determine a photometric redshift for this burst , @xmath15 ( greiner et al .",
    "2009 ) . using the usual convention , @xmath16 , the x - ray data decayed as @xmath17 with @xmath18 , both values completely consistent with the shape of the optical light curve and its spectral energy distribution : @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see fig . 2 of greiner et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "since the spectrum from 8 kev to 13 gev had the shape of a band function ( two power - law components smoothly joined ) it has been suggested that the observed radiation over the entire 6-decades interval in frequency was produced by the same source ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 , wang et al .",
    "2009 , zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "however , a closer analysis of the fermi data shows that this possibility can be ruled out .",
    "the first evidence for two different sources of radiation  one dominating in the sub - mev band and the other at @xmath1mev  comes from the fact that the flux in the 50300 kev band declined weakly with time ( @xmath21 ) during the initial 55s and then underwent a steep decline ( @xmath14 ) with a distinct signature of a short lived source of lifetime 55s when the source is suddenly turned off ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) ; where @xmath22 is the spectral index which for grb 080916c was @xmath61 in the 50300 kev energy band for @xmath23s . ] . this rapid decay in flux in the x - ray band has been observed in @xmath660% of all bursts detected by the swift satellite ( evans et al .",
    "in contrast , the source for high energy photons  declining as @xmath24  was active for at least 1400s , when the flux fell below the fermi / lat sensitivity ( see fig .",
    "4 of abdo et al . 2009 ) .",
    "further evidence for two distinct sources is provided by the detection of several other bursts by the fermi satellite for which the same behavior is seen : a longer lasting source for high energy photons relative to sub - mev photons ( see , e.g. ohno et al .",
    "2009 , cutini et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "it is striking that the decay of the lat light curve ( @xmath25 ) is exactly what one expects for synchrotron radiation from the shock heated circum - stellar medium ( csm ) by the relativistic jet of a grb such that @xmath26 . as a result of radiative losses the maximum electron energy is such that the synchrotron frequency in the shocked fluid rest frame is @xmath27mev or @xmath28gev in the lab frame ( see e.g. cheng & wei 1996 , fan & piran 2008 ) .",
    "however , this limiting synchrotron frequency depends on the details of the electron scattering process , and it is likely to be higher for highly relativistic shocks . ] ; from here on we will refer to this as external shock or es . we show that it is not only the time dependence of the es emission but also its magnitude that are the same as fermi / lat observations ( with no dependence of the flux in the lat band on unknown , and therefore adjustable , parameters ) .",
    "a number of uncertainties plague the emission calculation from a shock - heated gas .",
    "the largest of these are the unknown strength of the magnetic field , and the density of the circum - stellar medium .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the observed flux at a frequency @xmath29 that is larger than all characteristic frequencies for the shocked gas , namely the synchrotron peak and cooling frequencies , is independent of these two highly uncertain parameters ( kumar 2000 , panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "photons of energy @xmath010@xmath30mev safely satisfy this frequency criterion .",
    "the flux in this case can be shown to be equal to @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the fractions of energy of the shocked gas in electrons and magnetic fields respectively , @xmath34s is the time since the beginning of the explosion in the observer frame ( in units of 10s ) , @xmath35 is photon energy in units of 100mev , @xmath36erg is the scaled isotropic kinetic energy in the es , @xmath37 is the compton-@xmath37 parameter , @xmath38 is the redshift and @xmath39 is the luminosity distance to the burst . the second equality in equation ( 1 ) was obtained by taking @xmath40 , @xmath41s , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; @xmath44 because of klein - nishina effects even though @xmath45 , and furthermore , cooling o es electrons by inverse compton scattering of prompt @xmath46-ray photons can be shown to be weaker than synchrotron cooling .",
    "note that the flux at 100mev is approximately proportional to @xmath47 , the energy in electrons ; it is independent of the density of the circum - stellar medium ( @xmath48 ) , and has an extremely weak dependence on @xmath33 which for all practical purposes can be ignored .",
    "according to equation ( 1 ) the time dependence of the flux should be @xmath49 ( @xmath40 for grb 080916c ) which is in excellent agreement with the observed flux decay of @xmath12 in the lat band .",
    "we note that a good fraction of the energy of the explosion was released during the initial 8s of the burst , and for the next 47s the energy deposited in the external medium increased as @xmath50 , and thereafter no additional energy was added to the es .",
    "therefore , for @xmath51s  @xmath52s the light curve decay should have been @xmath53 due to energy injection in es ( a slightly steeper decay ",
    "@xmath54  will in fact occur during this time interval due to radiative loss of es energy ) , and for @xmath55s the decay attains the asymptotic slope of @xmath49 . before the deceleration time ,",
    "i.e. @xmath56s , the es light curve is expected to rise as @xmath57 which is significantly shallower than the observed rise of @xmath58 .",
    "this is a very puzzling feature that could probably shed light on the onset of the es and the particle acceleration mechanism .",
    "the observed 4s lag for the high energy photons at the beginning of the burst is due to the time it takes for energy transfer from grb jet to the external shock i.e. , the deceleration time ( sari & piran 1999 ) .    for a sample of 10",
    "well observed and studied grb afterglows it is found that @xmath59 ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) , and for grb 080916c , @xmath60 at @xmath41s .",
    "therefore , from equation ( 1 ) we find that the flux at 100 mev from shock heated external medium should be @xmath61jy , which is consistent with the observed value of 3@xmath62jy .",
    "it should be emphasized that this emission from the shocked external medium can not be avoided .",
    "it must be present at approximately the observed flux value as long as electrons carry some reasonable fraction of the shocked gas energy ( which we know is the case for grb afterglows ) , and the cooling frequency is @xmath63mev .",
    "does it require a coincidence for the superposition of two different spectra , that originated in two separate sources , to have the shape of a band function ?",
    "it turns out that no fine tuning or coincidence is needed because the spectral peaks , and the flux at the peak , for es radiation is closely tied to the grb jet luminosity which also regulates the sub - mev emission ; for a very broad range of values for @xmath33 and @xmath48 the peak of @xmath64 for the external shock emission , at the deceleration time of 4s , lies between @xmath61 mev and @xmath65mev .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of a superposition of external shock spectrum and the sub - mev source , and the result of a band function fit to it .",
    "we now determine the two uncertain parameters for the external shock mentioned previously , @xmath33 and @xmath48 , by making use of the spectra during the initial 55s of the burst .",
    "the external shock emission should not dominate the observed flux in the 8500 kev band since otherwise the spectrum in this band would be @xmath66 instead of the observed @xmath67 ; this means that the flux from es at @xmath41s between 8 kev and 500 kev should be less than 1 mjy ( the observed flux was 2 mjy ) .",
    "this condition provides an important constraint on @xmath33 and @xmath48 .",
    "the flux from external shock at @xmath68 kev and @xmath41s is given by ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 , chevalier & li 2000 ) @xmath69 for @xmath70 , the requirement that @xmath71mjy yields : @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "there is one other constraint that the external shock emission should satisfy , and it is that the es flux at 55s between 50 & 300 kev should be smaller than the observed value by at least a factor 10 ( so that the 50300 kev light curve can decline steeply for @xmath55s , as observed , when the sub - mev source turns off ) .",
    "we numerically solve for the allowed values of @xmath33 and @xmath48 that satisfy these two constraints , and we keep track of various possible ordering of characteristic frequencies .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 ; the numerical results are consistent with the analytical estimate provided above .",
    "note that there is a very wide range of @xmath33 and @xmath48 allowed by the prompt data .",
    "although we did not impose any constraint on @xmath74 , its value turns out to be @xmath75  consistent with @xmath76 pair opacity argument ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 , greiner et al .",
    "moreover , compton-@xmath37-parameter at 4s is @xmath3 , even though @xmath45 , because of klein - nishina reduction to electron ",
    "photon scattering cross - section ; this effect also makes the self - inverse compton scattering of es photons undetectable by fermi .",
    "another interesting point to note is that the entire broad range for @xmath33 allowed by the prompt emission data corresponds to a comoving - shock - frame magnetic field of @xmath77 milli - gauss , and that is of order what we expect from shock compression of a seed magnetic field in the circum - stellar medium of @xmath78 gauss ( pl . see fig .",
    "2 ) , i.e. no magnetic dynamo amplification of field is needed behind the shock front for this burst .",
    "the external shock that gave rise to the high energy emission ( @xmath1mev ) at early times will radiate at x - ray and optical bands at late times . for the region of ( @xmath33 , @xmath48 )",
    "parameter space allowed by the early time data ( @xmath79s ) we calculate the x - ray and optical flux at @xmath80 1 day after the burst , and find that these fluxes are in good agreement with the observed values for the entire allowed parameter space shown in fig .",
    "2 for a uniform density circum - stellar medium , and these fluxes are smaller by about a factor @xmath81 when the csm density decreases as @xmath82 .",
    "our calculations include the effect of energy added to the es for the initial 55s as well as the radiative loss of energy .",
    "the late time afterglow data is best modeled by a non - uniform csm where the density falls off a little bit more slowly than @xmath82 . ] . furthermore , the observed spectra and light curves in these bands , @xmath83 ( greiner et al .",
    "2009 ) , are also in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations ( the theoretically calculated values for the synchrotron peak and cooling frequencies at @xmath80 1 day are @xmath841ev and @xmath01kev , respectively , for the entire parameter space allowed by the early high energy data  shown in the top panels of fig . 2  and",
    "therefore we expect the spectra in the optical and the x - ray bands to be @xmath85 ) .",
    "the fact that the es parameters determined from the early time @xmath65 mev data provide good fit to the late time x - ray and optical emissions ( which are well known to be from es ) lends strong support to the interpretation that the radiation observed by fermi / lat originated in the es .",
    "one could argue that the observed x - ray and optical light curves ( at @xmath86day ) could have been more complex - than a single power - law - making it difficult to predict the late time x - ray and optical fluxes using the es model .",
    "however , optical light curves are often single power - law functions and very rarely show a plateau ( oates et al .",
    "moreover , a fraction of grbs show a single power - law decline in their x - ray light curve and grb 080916c could belong to this class of bursts ( liang et al .",
    "2009 ) ; we note that very bright grbs are less likely to contain a plateau in their x - ray light curve ( kumar , narayan , johnson 2008 ) and so there is a good chance that grb 080916c - the brightest burst ever detected - had a simple light curve .",
    "these arguments allow us to use the simple es model to predict the x - ray and optical flux at late time and compare it with the observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that this exercise works in the reverse direction as well , i.e. using the external shock parameters determined from the optical and x - ray data for @xmath4day we calculate the flux at 10@xmath30 mev at 150s ( fig .",
    "3 ; right hand panel ) , and find that to be in agreement with the observed data provided that we restrict @xmath87 ( @xmath33 & @xmath48 can take whatever value that is allowed by the late time afterglow ) .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that although the @xmath33@xmath48 parameter space allowed by the late time optical and x - ray data for grb 080916c is very large ( pl . see fig .",
    "3 ; left panel ) , the entire allowed range for @xmath33 by the late time data ( without making use of the early time lat data ) is consistent with a shock compressed circum - stellar medium magnetic field of strength 30 @xmath62-gauss or less .",
    "the constraints we use to obtain the es parameters in this reverse direction exercise are the following : ( i ) at 1 day the optical and x - ray frequencies should lie between the synchrotron peak and cooling frequencies , ( ii ) the es flux at 1 day should match the observed x - ray and optical fluxes at this time , ( iii ) the lorentz factor of the ejecta at 1 day should be @xmath88 , so that the initial jet lorentz factor is @xmath2 , and ( iv ) the es flux at 150s between 50 & 300 kev should be smaller than the observed value by at least a factor 10 ( see  3 ) .",
    "it is no small feat that the external shock model fits the data over 10-decades in frequency and 3-decades in time , and provides a natural explanation for a number of puzzling features observed by fermi during the first 10@xmath89s of the burst .",
    "fermi has detected a few other bursts in the high energy band .",
    "they all seem to share similar features ",
    "high energy photons lag lower energy photons initially but last for a longer duration of time ( omodei et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the external shock model provides a straightforward explanation for these `` generic '' features .",
    "the external shock model also makes a prediction that the fluence for @xmath90mev should be proportional to @xmath91 whenever the synchrotron cooling frequency is below 100 mev  a condition that is easy to check from the spectrum in the lat band ( this relation follows from eq .",
    "1 , which provides dependence on @xmath38 ) ; @xmath92 is the deceleration time of a grb jet  propagating into a wind like density stratified medium  which can be taken to be the observed lag time for high energy photons .",
    "this prediction can be used to confirm or disprove this model . if detectors are activated by flux level , rather than fluence",
    ", then they will only observe bursts with the highest @xmath74 since the flux scales as @xmath93 .",
    "short duration grbs should also satisfy the same scaling relation since the flux is independent of circum - stellar medium density .",
    "we summarize the 4 main reasons that @xmath1mev photons observed by fermi / lat were produced in the external shock .",
    "( 1 ) the expected flux from external shock at 100 mev , at @xmath41s , is @xmath61jy ( independent of @xmath48 and @xmath33 ) and that is in good agreement with the observed flux of 3@xmath62jy . ( 2 ) the radiation observed by lat lasted for a time ( 1400s ) much longer than the burst duration of 55s . ( 3 ) furthermore , the light curve decay in the lat band , @xmath94 , is what is expected for the external - shock emission . and so is the 4s lag for the @xmath5 mev photons . (",
    "4 ) the external shock parameters calculated using the initial 55s of data alone ( fig .",
    "2 ) , are able to explain the late time ( @xmath95day ) x - ray and optical afterglow data which is widely believed to be es emission ; as pointed out in footnote * 3 * the flux at late times depends on the density stratification of the circum - stellar medium , and for a wide range of possible density stratification the theoretically calculated flux lies within a factor of a few of the observed value . moreover",
    ", the converse is also true i.e. , late time afterglow data extrapolated back to 150s ( and also to 4s ) matches the observed flux at @xmath1mev .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1mev light curve rises as @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is puzzling , as mentioned before .",
    "there is another burst ( grb 061007 ) that also displays an extremely rapid rise of its optical light curve at early times ( rykoff et al .",
    "2009 ) and its isotropic equivalent energy release is also very high ( one of the highest ever recorded so far ) .",
    "this suggests that the fast rise might be related to the particle acceleration mechanism at the onset of the es , but more theoretical work is needed to determine the cause of this rapid rise .",
    "the fermi burst ( grb 080916c ) sheds a surprising light on the question of the origin of magnetic fields in external shocks .",
    "magnetic fields in the source inferred from the early lat and gbm data ( @xmath79s )  and independently calculated from the late afterglow data ( @xmath4day ) by itself ",
    "are entirely consistent with a @xmath78-gauss circum - stellar field compressed by the external shock , i.e. no extra field amplification is needed for the observed radiation ( this possibility was investigated in granot & knigl 2003 ) .",
    "grb 080916c was the brightest burst to date , and if no magnetic dynamo is needed for the external shock synchrotron emission for this burst then we suspect that this result is likely to be applicable to other grb afterglows as well .",
    "rbd dedicates this work to his wife jessa barniol and his uncle jose barniol .",
    "rbd also thanks rongfeng shen for very useful discussions .",
