    "the occurrence of non - equilibrium phase transitions is one of the most interesting properties of one - dimensional out - of - equilibrium models @xcite . in open boundary systems , changing the boundary parameters may result in special kinds of non - equilibrium phase transitions which are called _ the boundary induced phase transitions_. the existence of shocks is another interesting property of these lattice models .",
    "a shock is defined as a discontinuity between a hight - density and a low - density region in the density profile of particles on the lattice .",
    "the shocks have been studied both at the macroscopic level using the hydrodynamic equations and also at the microscopic level by solving the master equation of spatially discrete models .",
    "for example , at the macroscopic scale the shocks may appear in the solutions of the burgers equation with particles conversation @xcite . at the microscopic level",
    "the burgers equation can be described by the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite",
    ". the asep cotains one class of particles which can be injected and extracted from the boundaries of a one - dimensional chain while hopping in the bulk with asymmetric rates .",
    "this model has been studied widely during the last decade .",
    "it is known that by changing the injection and extraction rates , the asep undergoes several boundary induced phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the shocks may also appear in the density profile of the particles with the asep dynamics for certain values of the reaction rates .",
    "the same phenomenon might happen when the fixed number of such particles hop on a ring in the presence of a slow particle called an impurity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ recently , it has been shown that among one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems with open boundaries there are three families of models with a common property : the time evolution equation of a bernoulli shock measure developed by the hamiltonian of each of these models is quite similar to the time evolution equation of a single - particle random walk on a lattice with reflecting boundaries @xcite .",
    "this actually takes place provided that some constraints on the reaction rates of these systems are fulfilled .",
    "these models are the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , the branching - coalescing random walk ( bcrw ) and the asymmetric kawasaki - glauber process ( akgp ) .",
    "it is known that in an infinite system , and under some constraints , single shock or even consecutive multiple shocks may evolve in the asep @xcite-@xcite . in the latter case",
    "the time evolution equation for the multiple shock measure generated by the hamiltonian of the system is similar to the time evolution equation of @xmath0 random walkers . in the steady state",
    "the asep s probability distribution function can be written in terms of superposition of shocks . from the matrix product formalism ( mpf )",
    "point of view , in which the steady state weights are written in terms of the expectation values of product of non - commuting operators @xcite , @xmath0 consecutive shocks correspond to an @xmath1-dimensional representation of the asep s quadratic algebra @xcite .",
    "+ the question that might arise is that whether or not the steady state of the bcrw and that of the akgp can also be represented by finite dimensional representation of their quadratic algebras since their steady states can be written in terms of interactions of single shock .",
    "we will deal with this question in the first part of this paper .",
    "we will show that as far as a single shock structure is concerned the steady state of the bcrw and that of the akgp can be obtained from two - dimensional representations of their quadratic algebras .",
    "+ in @xcite we have studied a branching - coalescing model with open boundary in which the particles diffuse , coagulate and decoagulate on a one - dimensional chain .",
    "the particles are also allowed to enter and leave the chain only from the left boundary .",
    "this model had already been studied with reflecting boundaries in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the steady state of this open boundary model can be obtained using the mpf provided that the reaction rates satisfy a constraint . in this case",
    "its quadratic algebra has a two - dimensional representation , while in the case of reflecting boundary conditions the quadratic algebra of the model has a four - dimensional representation .",
    "recent investigations show that some of the classical concepts and theories in the equilibrium statistical mechanics , such as the yang - lee theory of equilibrium phase transitions @xcite , can be successfully applied to the out - of - equilibrium systems .",
    "there are several examples from the driven diffusive systems to the directed percolation models which confirm the applicability of this theory to the non - equilibrium systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we have also studied the phase transition of our model using the yang - lee theory by studying the roots of its grand canonical partition function @xcite .",
    "these zeros lie on a circle and intersect the positive real axis at an angle @xmath2 . according to the yang - lee theory this reveals a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "as we will see this model is an special case of the bcrw ; therefore , we expect to see the shock profiles in its steady state . in order to see the shock profiles we will confine the number of particles by working in a canonical ensemble .",
    "the sum over the steady state weights with fixed number of particles is defined as the canonical partition function of this model .",
    "the canonical partition function can be calculated exactly using the mpf .",
    "it turns out that the zeros of this function in the complex plan of one of the parameters lie on a curve which intersects the positive real axis at an angle @xmath3 . at the same time their density vanishes near the critical point",
    "it indicates a second - order phase transition . in the canonical ensemble",
    "one can also calculate the density profile of particles on the chain again using the mpf .",
    "our calculations show that in one phase the density profile of particle has an exponential behavior while in the other phase , as we expect , it is a shock . +",
    "another question that might arise is that under what conditions multiple shocks may evolve in this system .",
    "we will show that in our model if we let the particles to enter and leave the chain from the both ends of the chain , one can see the double shock structures given that the injection and extraction rates satisfy some constraints . in this case",
    "the time evolution equation of the shock measure is similar to that of two random walkers .",

    "is organized as follows : in the second section we will briefly review the basic concepts of the mpf . in the third section",

    "will also be introduced . in the forth section",
    "we will switch to our model proposed in @xcite and find its canonical partition function using the mpf .",
