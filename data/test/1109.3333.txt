    "we then investigate the effect of charging on the electronic energy band structure and atomic structure .",

    "therefore , the calculated wave functions and electronic energies are not affected even if @xmath10 is smaller than the electronic potential corresponding to infinite vacuum spacing .",
    "we demonstrate our point of view by solving directly the schrodinger equation to obtain the wave functions and energy eigenvalues for the planarly averaged 1d potentials of single layer and 3-layer graphene corresponding to @xmath2=12.5 , 25 , 50 @xmath31 in fig .",

    "zero of energy is set at the fermi level indicated by dash - dotted lines . the band gap is shaded .",
    "note that band gap increases under positive charging .",
    "parabolic bands descending and touching the fermi level for @xmath15 are free electron like bands .",

    "[ figure - bands ] the changes in band structure with charging are significant within dft .",
    "for example , the band gap ( i.e. the energy gap between the top of the valence band and the minimum of the conduction band ) of neutral single layer bn increases from 4.61 ev to 5.12 and to 5.54 ev as @xmath17 increases from @xmath17=0 to + 0.2 e / cell and to + 0.4 e / cell , respectively . the increase of the band gap occurs due to the fact that the electronic potential energy becomes deeper with increasing electron depletion . for @xmath38 , the fermi level dips in the valance band and creates holes .",
    "in contrast , parabolic free electron like bands , which occur above the vacuum level in the neutral case , start to descend as a result of negative charging ( @xmath15 ) and eventually they touch the fermi level . upon increasing @xmath17",
    "these parabolic bands start to be occupied and hence part of @xmath17 is transferred to the quantum well in the vacuum region .",
    "this way the rate of accumulation of excess charge in the conduction band of single layer nanostructure recedes .",
    "even if these parabolic bands appear as touching the fermi level in the same band structure in ( @xmath39)-plane they are physically separated from the states of single layer honeycomb structure under study .",
    "as it was mentioned before , this situation is an artifact of periodic boundary conditions and can be viewed as the vanishing of the work function .",
    "we note that in the case of negatively charged , finite size single - layer , the excess electrons are hindered from spilling out to the vacuum by a wide tunneling barrier , even if @xmath10 is lowered below the fermi level in vacuum for large @xmath3 .",
    "incidentally , for both @xmath12 and @xmath15 , the spin - polarized calculations carried out for single layers of graphene , ch , cf , bn and mos@xmath0 did not yield any magnetic state as a result of charging .",
    "another crucial effect of charging appears in the variation of the bond lengths with @xmath17 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure - lattice ] ( a ) the bond length or lattice constants of single layer graphene , bn , ch , cf and mos@xmath0 increase with increasing positive charge density @xmath40 . the elongation of the bond length is slow for small @xmath40 , but increases quickly when @xmath41 c / m@xmath42 .",
    "the bonds get longer when the electrons are removed from the system and hence bonds become weaker .",
    "the contour plots of total charge density in a plane passing through c - c and b - n bonds of graphene and bn honeycomb structures in fig .",
    "[ figure - lattice ] ( b ) and ( c ) , show that the charge density between atoms becomes weaker with increasing electron depletion .",
    "weakening of bonds can have crucial consequences as phonon softening and is observable through raman spectrum .",
    "in fact , the raman active mode of graphene calculated by using density functional perturbation theory is at 1524 @xmath43 and shifts down to 1510 @xmath43 for @xmath17=+0.2 e / cell , and to 1311 @xmath43 for @xmath17=0.4 e / cell . to confirm whether the elongation of bonds dominates the raman shift of graphene , we calculated the raman active modes of neutral graphene having the same lattice constant of graphene when charged by @xmath17=+0.4 e / cell . in this case",
    "the raman active mode shifted to 1274 @xmath43 , which is close to the raman active mode calculated for graphene charged with @xmath17=+0.4 e / cell .",
    "we also note that the excessive charging of single layer materials considered in this paper lead to instability .",
    "this is revealed from phonon dispersion calculations .",
    "for example , neutral graphene which has normally stable planar structure and positive frequencies of acoustical branches in bz , starts to attain imaginary frequencies of long wavelength acoustical modes at excessive charging .",
