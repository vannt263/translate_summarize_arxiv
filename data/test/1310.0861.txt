    "near earth asteroid ( 29075 ) 1950 da was first discovered in 1950 by c. a. wirtanen at lick observatory @xcite and then lost for more than 50 yr . in december 2000",
    "the asteroid was rediscovered at lowell observatory - loneos @xcite as 2000 yk@xmath3 and subsequently recognized to be 1950 da .    in 2001 , 1950",
    "da experienced an earth close approach at 0.05 au and radar observations were obtained from arecibo and goldstone .",
    "these radar observations significantly reduced the orbital uncertainty and allowed long - term predictions .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that there is a non - negligible probability ( upper bound 0.33% ) for an earth impact in march 2880 .",
    "the occurrence of such an impact is decisively driven by the yarkovsky effect , a subtle nongravitational perturbation arising from the anisotropic re - emission at thermal wavelengths of absorbed solar radiation .",
    "this perturbation causes a secular variation in semimajor axis resulting in a mean anomaly runoff that accumulates quadratically with time @xcite . as",
    "1950 da experiences several planetary encounters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) , the runoff caused by the yarkovsky effect is amplified and therefore becomes important for 1950 da s predictions .    @xcite use the 2001 radar observations to constrain the physical properties of 1950 da .",
    "the ondrejov asteroid photometry projectppravec / neo.html ] provides additional information on 1950 da s physical model from lightcurve observations obtained during the 2001 close approach .",
    "however , the known physical characterization does not yet allow an estimate of the yarkovsky effect .",
    "in particular , the pole orientation is still unknown and so is the sign of 1950 da s orbital drift .    because of the decisive contribution of the yarkovsky effect",
    ", 1950 da belongs to a class of `` special objects '' , which also includes asteroids ( 99942 ) apophis @xcite and ( 101955 ) bennu @xcite .",
    "each of these objects presents unique features and demanding tasks . in particular , for 1950",
    "da we are pushing the impact prediction horizon for a time interval that is four times longer than ever analyzed for any other asteroid .",
    "therefore , performing the impact hazard assessment requires a specific effort and the development of ad hoc techniques beyond what is routinely done by the automatic impact monitoring systems sentry and neodys @xcite .",
    "1950 da has a long observed arc that allows a precise estimate of the orbit .",
    "the earliest 18 observations are from 1950 . then , we have two isolated observations in 1981 and more than 450 observations from 2000 to 2012 . moreover , in march 2001 the arecibo and goldstone observatories obtained 13 radar observations , specifically 8 delay and 5 doppler measurements @xcite .",
    "( the contribution of the recently released 2012 radar observations is discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : new_rad ] . )    to properly handle the observation dataset and mitigate the effect of star catalog systematic errors , we applied the debiasing and weighting described by @xcite , which we refer to as cbm10 .",
    "furthermore , for observatories with @xmath4 observations on the same night we relaxed the weights by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "this relaxation factor reduces the contribution of batches containing a large number of observations , e.g. , ondrejov lightcurve observations in late february 2001 . among the post-2000 observations ,",
    "there are batches showing unusually high astrometric biases and therefore we removed all the batches with apparent bias larger than 1 `` .",
    "the discovery observation has a low number of significant digits , so it was weighted at 30 '' .",
    "finally , we applied weights at 2 \" to observations marked with the mpc flag ` a ' , i.e. , when right ascension and declination in the j2000 system were obtained by rotating the b1950 coordinates .",
    "table  [ t : nom_sol ] contains the orbital elements corresponding to this astrometric treatment , which is referred to as `` nominal '' throughout the paper .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this solution was computed without accounting for the yarkovsky effect , which is discussed in sec.[s : nongrav ]    .orbital solution for asteroid 1950 da .",
    "numbers in parentheses indicate the 1@xmath6 formal uncertainties for the corresponding digits in the parameter value.[t : nom_sol ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we found a @xmath7 probability for an earth impact of asteroid ( 29075 ) 1950 da in march 2880 . the corresponding palermo scale is @xmath8 , which is the highest among known possible asteroid impacts .",
    "the long - term propagation calls for a detailed analysis of all the possible sources of error , such as the astrometric treatment , the dynamical model , and the integration error . due to the related secular variation in semimajor axis , the yarkovsky effect plays a decisive role in the risk assessment .",
    "even though the yarkovsky perturbation can be modeled from the available physical characterization of 1950 da , there is ambiguity in the rotation state and therefore in the sign of the yarkovsky related orbital drift . to deal with this problem we introduced two additional constraints related to the fit to the astrometric data and the dynamical history of 1950 da .",
    "both these constraints suggest that the retrograde rotation is more likely , with an overall @xmath999% probability .",
    "we combined these two new independent sources of information with the physical model to enhance our knowledge of the yarkovsky effect , which was in turn used to compute the probability of an impact in 2880 .",
    "the exceptional effort required to assess the impact threat from 1950 da outlines the importance of the impact monitoring as part of the near - earth asteroids tracking and risk mitigation .",
    "future radar opportunities such as the 2032 close approach should confirm the spin orientation and better estimate the yarkovsky effect , thus resulting in an improved risk assessment .",
    "after the paper was accepted , the 2001 radar observations were remeasured and two 2012 arecibo range measurement were released @xcite . with the new data the astrometry provides a much stronger constraint to the yarkovsky effect , i.e. , @xmath10 au / d@xmath11 , and confirms that 1950  da is a retrograde rotator .",
    "obtained by using the physical model only ( p ) , the astrometry only ( a ) , and a combination of physical model and astrometry ( pa).[f : a2_new],width=377 ]    figure  [ f : a2_new ] is an update of fig .",
    "[ f : a2 ] .",
    "we consider the constraints from either the physical model ( p ) or the astrometry ( a ) , as well as the combination of them ( pa ) .",
    "the constraint from the dynamical evolution of 1950  da is not present as the astrometry already rules out the direct rotation . by using the same technique described in sec .",
    "[ s : risk ] we can compute the corresponding impact probabilities : @xmath12 for p , @xmath13 for a , and @xmath14 for pa .    on one hand the astrometry suggests that the physical model is underestimating the size of the yarkovsky effect",
    ". a possible explanation could be the presence of cohesive forces @xcite , which would lower the minimum bulk density .",
    "another possibility is that the thermal inertia of 1950  da is between 50 and 250 j m@xmath15",
    "s@xmath16 k@xmath17 , which is smaller than @xcite suggest but would still make sense as the known nea thermal inertias are quite scattered . on the other hand , the physical model suggests that @xmath18 is on the right side of the distribution obtained by the astrometry .",
    "therefore , we think that using both the astrometry and the physical model ( pa ) still provides the most reliable solution .",
    "the corresponding impact probability is @xmath14 and the palermo scale -0.83 .",
