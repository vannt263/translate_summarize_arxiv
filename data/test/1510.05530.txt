    "the luminosity function ( lf ) is a very important statistical characteristic of galaxy populations .",
    "the lfs provide information about galaxies and their evolution on the cosmological timescale . in this paper",
    "we consider the lf of the galaxies with an active star formation in the wave range or emission line in which the lion share of radiation provides by a young stellar population .",
    "more exactly we consider the radiation of galaxies shortly after a starburst .",
    "these galaxies underwent strong bursts of star formation on a time scale of a few myr .",
    "massive young stellar populations , which were formed during the burst , emit plenty of ionising and non - ionising uv radiation .",
    "later on , the h@xmath0 and uv luminosities strongly decrease with time after a starburst age @xmath1 myr , when the most massive stars start to fade out .",
    "naturally , this is resulted in the changes of the observed lf .",
    "this fact affects the lf in the wavelength ranges and emission lines which are good indicators of a star formation , while the lf in the optical range keeps its form .",
    "this effect is mostly pronounced for the h@xmath0 , far ultraviolet ( fuv ) , near ultraviolet ( nuv ) and far infrared ( fir ) luminosities .",
    "we allow that taking into account the short - term luminosity evolution we can derive a more adequate form of the lf of a sample of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the impact of the fading of galaxy luminosities on lf can be quite significant .",
    "we describe it for the arbitrary initial luminosity distribution and arbitrary luminosity evolution . to study the impact of the factor under consideration we introduced the initial , the current , the time - averaged , and the sample lfs . in section [ s : lf ] we derive relations between all these lfs in general case of an arbitrary luminosity evolution .",
    "as a rule we consider galaxies with a single knot of star formation , but this lf can be applied to galaxies with several knots of star formation , too . in section [ s : lf1 ]",
    "we specify these relations for the luminosity evolution of luminous compact galaxies ( lcg ) discussed by @xcite . in the sections [ s : aq ] and [ s : ln ]",
    "we use the popular forms of lfs , namely the schechter function and the log - normal one as the initial lfs and derive and analyze the corresponding lfs .",
    "our findings are summarised in section [ s : sum ] .",
    "the luminosity of the galaxy @xmath2 is maximal one just after a starburst and then decreases due to burning out of short - living massive stellar population : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is time after the starburst and @xmath5 is the luminosity at @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath7 for the sample of 795 lcgs was derived by @xcite .",
    "this sample includes a very extreme population of compact galaxies with very high equivalent widths , representing the high - end tail of the lf of the overall star - forming population .",
    "all galaxies in it underwent a burst of star formation less that 6 myr ago .",
    "so the radiation caused by the burst - like star formation prevails ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the luminosities in the h@xmath0 emission line , fuv and nuv continuum are described by the relation @xmath8 with @xmath9 myr and different values of the parameter @xmath10 ( see details in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the same function is valid for the luminosities in the 22 @xmath11 m ir band , calculated using _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) data and probably for the radio emission at 1.4 ghz @xcite .    for generality",
    "we start with studying the case of arbitrary @xmath7 .",
    "we will specify the relation ( [ e9 ] ) later .",
    "we try to determine the effect of the short - term luminosity evolution on the observed lf of some sample of galaxies @xmath12 . in order to do this",
    "we need some additional types of lfs .",
    "we introduce and consider the initial @xmath13 , the current @xmath14 , the time - averaged @xmath15 , and the sample @xmath12 lfs .",
    "we assume that star formation in galaxies from a sample occurs in short bursts separated by large periods without star formation , which are much greater than the lifetimes of stars producing a main part of ionizing uv radiation",
    ". then , h@xmath0 , fuv and nuv luminosities greatly decrease before the next consecutive starburst .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that all galaxies have only single star - forming region .",
    "the initial luminosity distribution @xmath13 describes the distribution of the galaxy luminosities @xmath5 immediately after the termination of the star formation burst .",
    "we consider all @xmath5 values for galaxies entering a unit volume and describe their distribution by the function @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the number of starbursts per unit volume with the initial luminosity in the interval from @xmath5 to @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath13 would coincide with the luminosity function @xmath15 if there were no temporal luminosity variations .",
    "this is a typical situation for the visible wavelength range , in which the radiation from long - lived old stellar populations is dominated .",
    "the similar situation occurs in the case of large galaxies with the continuous star formation , when the individual bursts of star formation hardly affect the total luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath0 , fuv and nuv luminosities in the lcgs are produced by the radiation of the young stellar population @xcite .",
    "therefore they vary on short time scales after the bursts of star formation .",
    "after the time interval @xmath4 after the starburst the initial lf @xmath13 turns into the time - dependent current lf @xmath14 because of decrease of galaxy luminosities . roughly speaking ,",
    "the current lf is what the initial one becomes after time @xmath4 .",
    "the lf @xmath18 is the number of galaxies per unit volume in the luminosity interval from @xmath19 to @xmath20 at time @xmath4 after a starburst .",
    "the galaxies from the sample are observed at different phases of luminosity evolution , i.e. with different time after the starburst @xmath4 . @xcite",
    "have shown that the galaxies from the sample with @xmath21 myr are approximately uniformly distributed over starburst ages @xmath4 . in this case an averaging over the sample corresponds to a time - averaging and therefore the time - averaged current lf @xmath14 coincides with the lf @xmath15 , which we will call the time - averaged lf . here",
    "@xmath22 is the number of galaxies per unit volume in the luminosity interval from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "consider the case of monotonous luminosity decrease according to ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "using the relationship ( [ e1 ] ) we find @xmath24 this current lf should be averaged over the time to find the function @xmath15 : @xmath25 we apply the lf averaging over a time period @xmath26 , which is much larger than the typical starburst age of the lcgs . instead of the time integration",
    "we apply an integration over @xmath5 . in the case of constant @xmath19",
    "we obtain the relation @xmath27 from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , where @xmath28 is the time derivative .",
    "thus , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a time interval during which galaxies with initial luminosities from @xmath5 to @xmath17 have the current luminosity @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the maximum initial luminosity of galaxies in the sample . it can be assigned as @xmath33 because @xmath34 is a rapidly decreasing function at large @xmath5 .",

    "the flux - limited sample includes galaxies up to the photometric distance @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the minimal flux , if extinction is not present . considering flat space and neglecting the differences between the photometric distance and other types of distances in cosmology",

    "for the samples with @xmath47 one ought to use the exact expression for @xmath40 from the relativistic cosmology , e.g. from the @xmath48cdm model . nevertheless , the simplified version with @xmath45 has some advantage .",
    "its simple form allows to obtain some useful relations like ( [ eq2 ] ) .    for the flux - limited samples with small @xmath46 we obtain the sample lf @xmath49 where the constant is derived from the normalisation condition @xmath50      substituting @xmath7 from eq .",

    "h@xmath0 and uv luminosities of a galaxy are constant during the period @xmath36 , which is approximately equal to the lifetime of o stars .",
    "after that time luminosities decrease by a factor of @xmath55 during every next time period @xmath36 .",
    "there are two marginal cases of eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) .",
    "the luminosity function is reduced to the standard one ( @xmath56 ) if @xmath57 ( constant luminosities ) or @xmath58 ( step , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the heaviside step function ) . the first term in brackets in eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) vanishes ( @xmath61 ) if @xmath62 ( monotonous decrease without a plateau ) or @xmath63 ( very slow decrease ) . for the h@xmath0 luminosity function @xmath64 myr@xmath65 @xcite and @xmath66 . for the fuv and the nuv luminosity functions the values of @xmath10 are smaller and the values of @xmath54 are larger",
    "therefore , the initial and time - averaged h@xmath0 , fuv and nuv luminosity functions for star - forming galaxies are expected to be different .",
    "let us denote lfs for these cases as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the function @xmath69 is the lf of the sample without the luminosity evolution , i.e. in the case of constant galaxy luminosities .",
    "taking into account the luminosity evolution we obtain ( [ e10 ] ) , which can be rewritten in the form @xmath70 there is no point in considering the case @xmath71 as a real lf , but we can do this formally to analyze the properties of sample lf at @xmath72 .",
    "let us denote the mean value of some quantity @xmath73 over the sample as @xmath74 the relation @xmath75 is valid for @xmath76 if these integrals are convergent , in particular at @xmath77 . as a result",
    "we have the equation @xmath78 connecting the sample averages of @xmath79 for lf @xmath80 taken into account affect of short - term luminosity evolution ( [ e9 ] ) and lf @xmath81 for the sample with invariable luminosities .",

    "it helps in calculation variance , skewness , kurtosis , etc .",
    "let us try two popular functions often used as a functional form of lf as a function @xmath69 in ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the first one is the schechter function @xcite , which is also known in the mathematical statistics as the gamma distribution @xmath84 parameters @xmath0 and @xmath85 are determined from the shape of this function .",
    "the slope in the @xmath86 ) plane is equal to @xmath0 for @xmath87 and changes rapidly at @xmath88 .    according to @xcite ,",
    "a much better fit for lf of galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) galaxies with @xmath89 is provided by the saunders distribution @xcite @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the decimal logarithm and @xmath92 . note that @xcite used the notation @xmath85 in ( [ saund ] ) .",
    "we add the subscript s to distinguish this quantity from the @xmath85 in ( [ sc ] ) .",
    "if the optimal value of @xmath93 in ( [ saund ] ) is small and the majority of the sample galaxies have luminosities @xmath94 , this distribution can be simplified .",

    "we can drop the unity in the @xmath96 term in eq .",

    "only the combination of @xmath93 and @xmath101 gives the authentic parameter @xmath102 .    from ( [ e7 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] )",
    "we can obtain the lfs for the sample of star - forming galaxies with initial luminosities distributed according to the schechter ( [ sc ] ) and log - normal ( [ en1 ] ) functions .",

    "this equation of fourth degree must have at least one other solution with the exception of special case of multiple root .",

    "both distributions are practically coincident , despite the fact that they are characterised by considerably different sets of parameters .",
    "naturally , if the distance between roots is small this leads to a complex form of the 1@xmath132 confidence region in the three - dimensional parameter space and the strong correlation between the parameters for all methods of fitting , i.e. the maximum likelihood method ( mlm ) @xcite .",
