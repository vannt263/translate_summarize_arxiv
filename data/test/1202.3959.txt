    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are currently believed to be close binary systems at a late evolutionary stage ( warner 1995 ) . as a rule , cvs consist of a more massive white dwarf ( wd ) ( primary ) and a less massive red dwarf ( secondary ) .",
    "the secondary overfills its roche lobe , causing mass transfer to the primary .",
    "since the matter accreting onto the wd has a significant angular momentum , it does not fall directly onto it but forms an accretion disk around the wd ( at weak wd magnetic fields @xmath3 ) . at magnetic fields @xmath4 ( intermediate polars ) ,",
    "the wd magnetic field destroys the accretion disk at radii smaller than the alfven radius .",
    "further out , accretion occurs along wd magnetic field lines . at strong wd magnetic fields @xmath5 ( polars ) ,",
    "the magnetic field prevents the formation of a disk and the matter moves along magnetic field lines from the outset .",
    "whether this binary will be a polar or an intermediate polar depends not only on the wd magnetic field strength but also on the accretion rate and the wd roche lobe size , i.e. , on the binary period and the component mass ratio .",
    "clearly , short - period binaries with a low accretion rate will be polars with a higher probability .",
    "the secondaries of long - period cvs often have radii exceeding appreciably those of single main sequence stars with the same mass ( patterson et al .",
    "this is apparently a consequence of additional heating of the secondary at the common - envelope stage ( schreiber and gnsicke 2003 ; shimanskii et al .",
    "however , the secondaries manage to relax in the time of a fairly long accretion - free evolutionary stage in the 2 - 3 h period gap and their radii become close to those of single main - sequence stars .",
    "this allows the well - known theoretical stellar mass - radius relation to be used , which , in turn , makes it possible to uniquely relate the secondary mass and the binary period ( howell et al .",
    "the red dwarf mass - orbital period relations ( @xmath6 ) derived from observations confirm the theoretical results ( patterson et al .",
    "2005 ; knigge 2006 ) .",
    "the accretion disk is currently believed to have a fairly complex structure .",
    "a hot spot is formed at the accreting gas stream - accretion disk impact site ( for a classical study of the observed properties of the hot spot in quiescence of the dwarf nova z cha , see wood et al .",
    "it is easiest to assume that the hot spot is the matter heated by a shock during the stream - disk impact .",
    "however , there are numerical gasdynamic calculations that show that the stream and the accretion disk are a morphologically single structure and their interaction is impactless ( see , e.g. , the review by fridman and bisikalo 2008 ) . in the calculations of this group , an extended shock emerges along the back ( relative to the direction of orbital motion ) side of the stream where the accretion disk matter collides with it ( the so - called `` hot line '' ) .",
    "another factor breaking the axial symmetry of the accretion disk is the tidal interaction of the secondary . under certain conditions , it can give rise to spiral density waves in the disk ( boffin 2001 ) , which were first detected in ip peg from observations ( steeghs et al .",
    "1997 ; steeghs 2001 ; papadaki 2008 ) .",
    "the calculations of the already mentioned group ( fridman and bisikalo 2008 ) showed that the tidal effect from the secondary could give rise to a spiral density wave consisting of one arm in the outer and partially inner disk ( for a hot accretion disk ) or two arms in the outer disk ( for a cold disk ) .",
    "for cold accretion disks , hydrodynamic modeling predicts the formation of a precessional density wave in the inner disk that is almost stationary relative to a remote observer . for hot accretion disks , even if the mass transfer rate in the binary changes only slightly , modeling predicts ( bisikalo et al . 2001 ) the formation of a one - armed density wave in the inner disk that revolves around the wd approximately a factor of 5 faster than does the secondary .",
    "this leads to emission variability with a period of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , both observations and gasdynamic calculations suggest a complex structure of the accretion disks ; their further studies in cvs are needed for a better understanding of this structure .",
    "the best tool for such studies is the method of doppler tomography proposed by marsh and horne ( 1988 ) .",
    "the one - dimensional emission line profiles obtained with a high spectral resolution during one or more complete orbital periods serve as the input data . using these profiles and knowing the basic parameters of the binary",
    ", we can reconstruct the doppler tomogram , which is a map of the intensity distribution for a given emission line in velocity space i(vx , vy ) .",
    "the assumption that a distinctive radial velocity corresponds to the observed intensity at each point of the emission line profile underlies the method .",
    "thus , the line profile at a given orbital phase is considered as a record of the projection of the velocity field for the emitting material onto the line of sight corresponding to this orbital phase .",
    "having a set of such projections ( spectral line profiles ) for a set of phases covering the entire period , we can reconstruct the intensity distribution map in velocity space and study the spatial distribution of the emitting plasma in terms of the adopted model for the motion of matter ( for example , by assuming the matter to rotate in keplerian orbits in the disk around the white dwarf ) .",
    "any nonuniformity in the distribution of emission over the disk will be reflected in such a tomogram .",

    "however , a double - peaked structure of the hydrogen and helium emission lines was detected in the binary spectrum ( bikmaev and sakhibullin 2008 ) .",

    "the relative intensity of the blue peak is higher than that of the red one ; subsequently , the intensity of the red peak becomes more intense during the eclipse and the flux again becomes higher in the blue peak after the eclipse ( phases greater than 0.09 ) .",
    "the radial velocities for several lines were obtained by the shafter ( 1983 ) method and their dependence on the orbital phase was fitted by a sine wave . in this case , the points near the eclipse ( the phases from -0.1 to 0.1 ) were disregarded . in the method used ,",
    "two narrow ( compared to the width of the investigated line ) gaussians whose centers are separated by a distance @xmath39  (  )   are cut out in the blue and red emission line wings . by concurrently moving both gaussians over the spectrum and comparing the fluxes in the line wings cut out by the gaussians ,",
    "it is necessary to achieve the equality of these fluxes .",
    "the wavelength corresponding to half the separation between the gaussians can then be considered to correspond to the wavelength of the entire investigated line and its radial velocity can be measured .",
    "obviously , the result will depend on the chosen separation between the gaussians @xmath39 .",
    "in an ideal case , the emission line width is believed to be determined only by the doppler effect due to the keplerian rotation of the matter in the accretion disk , while the line intensity distribution over the disk is axisymmetric .",
    "it can then be assumed that the radiation in the line wings is formed closest to the wd and it is the change in the positions of the emission line wings that best reflects the the wd radial velocity .",
    "therefore , it is assumed in the method under consideration that the larger the separation @xmath39 , the more accurate the wd radial velocity obtained . at the same time , however , @xmath39 can not be chosen to be too large , because the gaussians will begin to go outside the emission line into the continuum .",
    "this manifests itself in a significant increase in the relative error @xmath40 of the amplitude of the sine wave fitting the derived velocity curve .",

    "this means that the disk half - thickness in the region of the second spot , even if the probable disk thickening is taken into account , is comparable to the wd radius and the external irradiation flux can not exceed considerably the intrinsic flux from the disk .",
    "strong irradiation of the disk is possible only in binaries with neutron stars whose radii ( @xmath115 cm ) are much smaller than those of white dwarfs at the same geometrical sizes of the disks . given that not all of the externally incident flux is thermalized , it may be ultimately concluded that external irradiation can not provide the radiation of the second spot .",
    "this conclusion is valid only if the luminosity of the second spot was determined correctly .",
    "if , alternatively , its radiation is not thermalized and exceeds the disk luminosity by several tens of percent only in the optical spectral range ( for example , due to emission lines ) , then external irradiation is , in principle , capable of providing the observed optical variability , just as in intermediate polars .",
    "consider the possibility that 1rxs j1808 is an intermediate polar .",
    "several objects of this type , for example , dq her ( walker 1956 ; saito and baptista 2009 ) and ls peg ( rodrigez - gil et al .",
    "2001 ) , exhibit variability both with the wd spin period and with the beat period between the orbital and spin periods .",
    "the amplitude of the optical brightness oscillations with the wd spin period is low ( @xmath116 for dq her and @xmath117 for ls peg ) , while the detection of the beat period produced by the reflected radiation is most significant in the hydrogen emission lines and heii4686 .",
    "the heii4686 line in emission is formed mainly through photoionization by external hard radiation and is a good indicator of external disk irradiation .",
    "for example , in the spectrum of dq her ( chanan et al .",
    "1978 ) , the flux in heii4686 is comparable to that in the balmer lines .",
    "therefore , the weakness of the heii4686 line and the bowen blend in the spectrum of the source being investigated serves as direct evidence for insignificant external irradiation of the disk in 1rxs j1808 .",
    "this is also suggested by the absence of any structure in the doppler tomogram of the heii4686 line .    if the source of additional optical radiation that we consider to be the second spot were associated with the rotating wd , then",
    "the eclipses would be deeper against the background of an enhanced brightness of the binary outside eclipse , whereas the reverse is true  the eclipses are deeper at a general reduction in the binary brightness ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is consistent with the model of a second spot on the disk presented here . on the whole",
    ", the central regions of the disk near the wd are the main eclipsed source of optical radiation .",
    "the wd itself , even if very hot ( we took a temperature of 50000 k ) , makes a minor contribution to the total brightness of the binary .",
    "we modeled the binary light curves by assuming the inner disk radius to exceed the wd radius .",
    "thus , we simulated the appearance of a magnetosphere around a magnetized wd .",
    "satisfactory results can be achieved only at an inner disk radius that does not exceed 34 wd radii ( @xmath118   cm ) . at the accretion rate under consideration ( even when its increase by several times as the inner disk radius increases is taken into account ) , the wd magnetic field strength turns out to be less than 10@xmath119 g. taking into account all of the above arguments , we may conclude that 1rxs j1808 is not an intermediate polar with a high probability .",
    "the only remaining possibility is the release of energy in the second spot through direct accretion apart from the disk ( hellier 1993 , see also neustroev et al .",
    "this requires assuming that part of the accreting material moves under the accretion disk and is stopped by a thickening on it in the form of a tidal density wave . if the mass accretion rate above the disk is comparable to that in the disk , then the interaction of the accreting stream with the density wave located at a distance of 56 wd radii provides the required bolometric luminosity of the spot .",
    "the possibility that the presumed stream of matter interacts not with the density wave but with the wd magnetosphere must not be ruled out .",
    "however , in this case , to explain the spot revolution around the wd , we have to assume that the magnetosphere is highly asymmetric .",
    "the hypothesis of a tidal wave is also supported by the coincidence of the revolution period of the second spot with the theoretically predicted value ( bisikalo et al .",
    "we showed that 1rxs j1808 is a cataclysmic variable with a nonuniform brightness distribution in the disk with the component masses @xmath74 , @xmath76 and the binary inclination @xmath75 .",
    "our doppler mapping and light curve modeling revealed at least two spots in the accretion disk , at the stream.disk impact site , and a spot corresponding to a density wave and revolving around the white dwarf with a period of .@xmath120 .",
    "the luminosity of the second spot is most likely related to direct accretion of matter onto the disk thickening produced by a tidal density wave .",
    "this binary is most likely a cataclysmic variable star in outburst similar in properties to nova - like stars , and further photometric and spectroscopic observations are required to confirm this conclusion .",

    "we are also grateful to the tubitak for partial support in using rtt-150 ( the russian - turkish 1.5-m telescope in antalya ) .",
