    "a most striking example comes from spin ladders : interpolating between the chain geometry and the square lattice geometry , they have provided an interesting new playground to explore the physics of low - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems @xcite . specifically , it has been shown that af heisenberg spin-@xmath1 ladders with an even number of legs are quantum spin liquids with purely short - range spin correlations .",

    "we observe a strong enhancement of correlations upon doping up to @xmath12 legs . in the specific case of 2-leg ladders ,",
    "we find that the system realizes the physics of the rehm with a _ discrete _ distribution of the effective couplings , leading to a _ non - universal _ behavior at low temperatures ; hence the known predictions for the universal regime of the rehm with a continuous distribution of couplings are expected not to apply to realistic models of doped spin ladders .",
    "2 .   for bond - diluted ladders",
    ", we find that correlations are _ suppressed _ by a low level of dilution , due to dilution - induced dimerization .",
    "hence the system is first driven to a gapless phase with short - range correlations .",
    "the correlation length becomes logarithmically divergent for vanishing temperatures only beyond a critical dilution .",

    "on the other hand , according to a real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) approach @xcite , the system at a lower temperature is increasingly sensitive to the part of the distribution related to the weaker couplings ; given that this part is the one which best approximates a continuous distribution , one could naturally expect that at very low temperatures the physics of the rehm with continuous couplings be reproduced by the doped 2-leg ladders . this argument would then suggest that , when lowering the temperature , the system will sooner or later attain the universal regime of the rehm with continuous couplings if @xmath117 .",
    "nonetheless one can argue that in a doped 2-leg ladder the rsrg flow has to be necessarily stopped at a finite length , corresponding roughly to the average segment length @xmath108 . in practice",

    "in the following , we consider the doping- and temperature dependence of correlations in bond - diluted ladders , which show a marked difference with respect to site dilution . this is due to a fundamental geometric aspect which distinguishes site and bond dilution : diluting a site leaves a single unpaired spin , giving rise to a lm , while eliminating a bond leaves always _ two _ unpaired spins , located on different sublattices .",

    "we observe that @xmath220 ( @xmath221 for 2-led ladder ) , so that the simultaneous suppression and enhancement of correlations due to dilution of different types of bonds are in strong competition .",
    "the fact that at low doping the suppression of correlation wins is simply due to combinatorics : in 2-leg ladders ( a ) , rung bonds only hold a fraction @xmath222 while leg bonds contain @xmath223 of all bonds ; in 4-leg ladders ( b ) , outer - rung bonds only represent a fraction @xmath224 of all the bonds , whereas leg bonds and center - rung bonds are respectively @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",

    "the hamiltonian describing the effective interaction between these moments is a random exchange heisenberg model ( rehm ) , with a gapless spectrum and power - law diverging correlations as temperature decreases to zero .",
    "we find that the distribution of the effective couplings has an intrinsically discrete structure , which prevents the system from realizing the universal regime of the rehm with continuous couplings .",
    "further studies would hence be desired to clarify the role of a discrete distribution of effective couplings in determining the fixed point which governs the low temperature physics of this system .",
    "bond dilution , on the other hand , can either enhance or suppress locally the spin gap in even - leg ladders , depending on the location of the bond which is diluted . as a result of these competing effects , weak bond dilution is not enhancing the correlations of pure ladders .",

    "this behavior may suggests that the low - temperature behavior of the system is governed by an infinite randomness fixed point over an extended range of parameters .",
    "nonetheless , based on the investigation of the uniform susceptibility of the system , and by comparison with existing results on disordered ladders , we argue that this might not be the true asymptotic behavior for @xmath11 , and that the system is more likely to remain in a griffiths phase for all values of bond dilution .    in order to connect our results to experiments on site - diluted and bond - disordered ladders ,",
    "a fundamental question to address is the role of finite inter - ladder couplings , which are unavoidable in real materials .",
    "if @xmath233 is their energy scale , such couplings drive the system towards a three - dimensional magnetically ordered phase below a temperature @xmath234 , which can be estimated via a mean - field approach as @xmath235 , where @xmath178 is the correlation length of the uncoupled ladders . for a gapless critical phase , as that induced by site dilution ( at any concentration ) and by bond dilution ( beyond a critical concentration ) , @xmath102 diverges for @xmath11 , so that the system orders at finite temperature . on the other hand",

    ", short - range correlations proper of the pure ladder persist up to a critical doping , so that three - dimensional ordering in coupled ladders should be absent at weak dilution .",

    "it is to be said that , at the low temperature to which the figure refers ( @xmath242 ) , the correlation length on the doped 4-leg and 6-leg ladders grows to values which are no longer satisfying the condition @xmath243 , and hence it is limited by the system size ( @xmath164 ) explored there ."
