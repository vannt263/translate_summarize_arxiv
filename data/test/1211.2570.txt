    "baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) produced by the interaction of photons and baryons in the early universe provide an absolute standard rod that is calibrated by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the bao scale is determined by well - understood linear physics and depends only on the physical densities of dark matter and baryons . in principle",
    ", the bao scale can be measured to about 1% precision from tracers of the large - scale structure of the universe over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "it is therefore a powerful probe of cosmic geometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , particularly as it can be used to measure the evolution of both the hubble parameter @xmath4 radially along the line of sight and the angular diameter distance @xmath5 tangentially across the line of sight .",
    "however to achieve the full precision possible from the bao scale requires large samples of tracers ( @xmath610@xmath7 objects ) over large volumes ( @xmath61gpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "bao are complementary to other probes of the universe s geometry , such as supernova measurements of luminosity distance @xmath9 , in that they measure different cosmological properties and have a different physical basis ( and therefore have different sources of systematic errors ) .",
    "the main potential sources of systematic errors for bao measurements are non - linear clustering , redshift - space distortions and possible scale - dependent bias .    at low redshift ,",
    "bao yield a measurement of the distance scale that requires only the cmb calibration of the sound horizon scale and is largely independent of the details of the cosmological model ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus a measurement of the bao scale in a low - redshift ( @xmath10 ) galaxy survey like the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) yields a direct and nearly model - independent measurement of the hubble constant @xmath11 .",
    "the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) is a redshift and peculiar velocity survey of the southern sky ( jones  2004 , 2006 , 2009 ) .",
    "it used the 6df multi - fibre spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) operated by the australian astronomical observatory ( aao ) to spectroscopically survey a sample of near - infrared galaxies selected from the 2mass extragalactic source catalog ( xsc ; @xcite ) covering the whole southern sky outside of 10@xmath12 from the galactic plane .",
    "the 6dfgs measured redshifts for more than 125000 galaxies with @xmath13 and fundamental plane peculiar velocities for about 9000 early - type galaxies .",
    "the results discussed here are based on the 6dfgs redshift survey , for which the median redshift is @xmath14 .    for the purpose of measuring the correlation function ,",
    "galaxies were excluded from the sample if they lay in sky regions with completeness @xmath1560% .",
    "this reduced the sample to 75117 galaxies .",
    "the selection function was derived by scaling the survey completeness as a function of magnitude to match the integrated on - sky completeness using mean galaxy counts .",
    "the effective weighted volume of the sample is 0.08@xmath16gpc@xmath8 , and the effective redshift at which the bao scale is measured is @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the correlation function for this sample of galaxies computed using the @xcite method with inverse density weighting following @xcite and an integral constraint correction .",
    "the errorbars on the correlation function points are based on log - normal realisations .",
    "full details of the methodology are given in @xcite .",
    "the bao peak in the correlation function at a scale of 105@xmath18mpc  is clearly visible .",
    "the correlation function is modelled accounting for the wide - angle effects in this large - area survey , the effects of non - linear evolution in the galaxy clustering , and the scale - dependence of the bias ; again , details are given in @xcite .",
    "the 6dfgs sample is not large enough to constrain @xmath19 and @xmath20 separately using the 2d correlation function ; instead we constrain the combined quantity @xmath21 ( @xcite ) using the 1d correlation function .    the model for the correlation function",
    "uses parameter values from wmap7 ( @xcite ) to define the power spectrum and the bao scale .",
    "we fit the correlation function over the range 10@xmath18mpc  to 190@xmath18mpc .",
    "the free parameters in our model are the physical matter density @xmath22 , the bias @xmath23 , the non - linear damping scale @xmath24 , and the scale distortion parameter @xmath25 that measures the deviation of the bao scale from the fiducial cosmological model .    our best - fit model for the correlation function",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] and has parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( 95% confidence lower limit ) , and @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath30  mpc , with a precision of 5.9% .",
    "marginalising over @xmath24 and using a prior on @xmath22 from wmap7 , we obtain a measurement for the hubble constant of @xmath31kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , which has an uncertainty of 4.8% . the corresponding estimate for @xmath32",
    "is @xmath33 .",
    "the joint constraints on @xmath11 and @xmath32 are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .     and",
    "@xmath32 from the 6dfgs bao measurement ( black contours ) , the wmap7 cmb observations ( blue ) and the bao and cmb measurements combined ( red).,width=377 ]    the 6dfgs result for @xmath11 ( @xcite ) has comparable precision to that published recently from the sh0es distance - ladder program ( @xcite ) , @xmath34kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , although our result is 1.7@xmath35 lower .",
    "it is similarly comparable to , and in better agreement with , the model - dependent wmap7 estimate ( @xcite ) , @xmath36kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the advantages of the 6dfgs result are that it is not reliant on a series of distance ladder steps ( unlike the sh0es result ) and that it is largely independent of the cosmological model ( unlike the wmap7 result ) .",
    "how precise could future @xmath11 measurements from low - redshift galaxy surveys be ?",
    "two large low-@xmath37 galaxy surveys are in prospect : the wallaby hi survey ( @xcite ) planned for the australian ska pathfinder and the taipan optical survey planned for the ukst ( @xcite ) . wallaby is expected to start in 201415 .",
    "it will cover the entire sky ( with a matching westerbork survey ) and give redshifts for @xmath66@xmath3810@xmath39 galaxies with @xmath40 and @xmath41 over a volume @xmath42gpc@xmath8 .",
    "taipan is a southern - sky survey expected to start in 2015",
    ". it will ( at a limit of @xmath43 ) give redshifts for @xmath64@xmath3810@xmath39 galaxies with @xmath44 and @xmath45 over a volume @xmath46gpc@xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the predicted bao signal in the correlation functions for both these surveys , based on 100 log - normal realisations .",
    "we find that wallaby obtains essentially the same precision in measuring @xmath11 as 6dfgs .",
    "however the deeper taipan survey , with its larger effective volume and higher bias , can measure @xmath11 with 3% precision .",
    "in addition , density field reconstruction has shown significant improvement in the cosmological parameter constraints by using extra information from the density field ( @xcite ) . at low redshift",
    "this gives an improvement of about a factor of two , so could improve the precision of the @xmath11 measurement for 6dfgs and wallaby to @xmath62.5% and for taipan to @xmath61.5% . a combined analysis using both the low - bias wallaby galaxies and the high - bias taipan galaxies could do even better ."
