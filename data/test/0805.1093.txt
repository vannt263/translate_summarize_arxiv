    "in heavy ion collisions , energetic jets are expected to lose a significant amount of energy when passing through the surrounding quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "this jet quenching phenomenon leads to a large suppression of the yield of high-@xmath0 hadrons in au+au collisions compared to the yield expected from a superposition of @xmath1 collisions @xcite at the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "induced gluon radiation was expected to be the largest contributor to the momentum degradation of the leading jet parton . however , experimental results on the quenching of heavy flavors @xcite has led to new efforts to revisit elastic energy loss @xcite and non - perturbative mechanisms @xcite .",
    "jet quenching measurements deliver important information about the medium in terms of the average squared momentum transfer to the jet per unit path length , @xmath2 . besides quenching as a manifestation of energy loss of the leading high-@xmath0 parton , the chemical composition of a jet can also change through flavor changes of the leading parton .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of collisions of the high-@xmath0 parton with thermal partons .",
    "the probability of conversion is related to the path length through the medium and the collisional conversion widths .",
    "thus by tracking the flavor of jets ( defined as the flavor of the leading parton ) throughout their interaction with the medium , transport properties of the medium which are independent of and complementary to @xmath3 can be obtained .",
    "eventually , the flavor changes will be reflected by the hadron composition of the jet .",
    "flavor changing processes were first studied in the context of light quarks and gluons @xcite , and parton to photon conversions @xcite .",
    "more recently , we unified these two processes and discussed new observables which could be measured at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) or the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that conversions of light quarks to gluons could help solve the puzzle of very similar nuclear modification factors @xmath4 for pions and protons observed by the star experiment @xcite .",
    "these seemed to be incompatible with a relative energy loss of 9/4 for gluons and light quarks .",
    "however , as we discussed in more detail in @xcite , the concept of a fixed flavor for the leading jet parton is ill - defined in a medium .",
    "conversions to real or virtual photons are just other examples of what can happen to a fast quark or gluon traversing a quark gluon plasma .",
    "although much rarer than conversions to strongly interacting partons , it has been shown that these photons can make a significant contribution to the direct photon or dilepton spectrum at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that strange hadrons might be the ideal probe for flavor conversions at rhic energies .",
    "this is due to the strong gradient between the very small initial strange quark content of jets at rhic , and the almost full chemical equilibration of strangeness in the plasma .",
    "jets coupling to the medium will be driven toward chemical equilibrium and thus kaons and @xmath5-hyperons have to be enhanced relative to pions and protons at large @xmath0 when compared to naive expectations from @xmath1 collisions .",
    "measurements of this enhancement could shed light on the mean free path of fast gluons and light quarks in the medium . at lhc",
    ", the value of strangeness as a high-@xmath0 probe is diminished through the large initial strangeness content of jets at larger energies .",
    "when translating leading particle flavor into hadrons it has to be kept in mind that the hadron chemistry can also be altered through the increased multiplicity in a jet cone interacting with the medium as studied in @xcite .",
    "two important questions emerge from the discussion of high-@xmath0 strangeness enhancement at rhic .",
    "first , can heavy quarks , in particular charm , play a similar role as a probe for the average mean free path at lhc ? and",
    "secondly , is the suppression of charm found at rhic compatible with the mechanism proposed here which boosts the yields of rare particle species at intermediate and high @xmath0 ? in this report , we answer these questions by studying the production of high-@xmath0 heavy quarks from jet conversions in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we compute the contributions from leading order ( lo ) processes in perturbation theory multiplied by a @xmath6-factor .",
    "the heavy quarks can be produced from the annihilation process @xmath7 that converts a gluon jet and a thermal gluon to a pair of heavy quarks , and also through the compton processes @xmath8 by transferring the momentum of the incoming jet to that of a slow moving heavy quark in the medium .",
    "we follow the method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the propagation of the high @xmath0 heavy quark in the expanding fireball within the framework of a fokker - planck equation .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the transport coefficients of heavy quarks and the collisional widths for the conversion of light partons to heavy quarks .",
    "we then proceed to present numerical results for charm and bottom quarks at rhic and lhc in sec.[propagate ] using a consistent model based on rate equations for conversions and a fokker - planck equation for energy loss .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "first we discuss the propagation of heavy quarks in a partonic medium .",
    "it can be described in the framework of a fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath9f({\\bf p},t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the distribution function of heavy quarks .",
    "the drag and diffusion coefficients are @xmath11 with @xmath12,\\nonumber\\\\ b_1({|\\bf p|})&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\langle{(\\bf p}\\cdot{\\bf p'})^2\\rangle}{|{\\bf p}|^2 }    -2\\langle{\\bf p}\\cdot{\\bf p'}\\rangle + { \\bf p}^2\\langle 1\\rangle\\right ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 and @xmath14 label the momenta of the heavy quark before and after each collision , respectively .",
    "we define the thermal averaging @xmath15 in the elastic process @xmath16 as @xmath17y(\\bf p').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the scattering amplitude and @xmath19 is the spin and color degeneracy factor for heavy quark .    using a fixed coupling constant @xmath20",
    "= 0.3 and masses @xmath21 for thermal gluons and @xmath22 for thermal quarks @xcite , we calculate the transport coefficients for both charm ( @xmath23=1.2 gev ) and bottom ( @xmath24=4.5 gev ) quarks numerically at leading order accuracy for the compton processes @xmath16 . we show the results in figs .",
    "[ drag_coeff ] , [ diffu0_coeff ] , and [ diffu1_coeff ] . the drag coefficients @xmath25 decrease with increasing momentum of the incoming jets while diffusion coefficients behave the opposite way .    to study the dynamics of heavy quark in an expanding qgp medium , we focus on the degradation of transverse momentum of heavy quark jets , which can be taken into account using a langevin equation @xcite obtained from the fokker - planck equation in ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) by calculating the first and second modes , @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the random force according to the normal distribution @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 is the inverse of the diffusion - coefficient matrix @xmath30 defined in eq .",
    "( [ coefficient ] ) .",
    "now we discuss the implementation of the conversion of light quarks ( u , d , s ) and gluons into heavy quarks through the processes @xmath7 and @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the rate equation @xmath32 the collisional conversion widths can be estimated as @xmath33 in the notation defined in eq .",
    "( [ average1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ heavy_width ] , we plot the width of a gluon jet converting to charm and bottom via the process @xmath7 . we have introduced a constraint on the momentum of the outgoing heavy quark jet .",
    "we only count the heavy quark as a jet particle if it carries the larger momentum of the two final state partons .",
    "the conversion will also cause effective energy loss since the final momentum is usually smaller than the initial gluon jet momentum due to the mass threshold .",
    "this is different from the case of light flavor conversions which can occur with 100% efficiency .",
    "the resulting average momentum of the heavy quark after conversion from a gluon , @xmath34 , as a function of the incoming gluon momentum @xmath35 are shown in fig .",
    "[ heavy_mom ] .",
    "@xmath36 has an almost linear dependence on @xmath35 only depends very weakly on temperature .    as mentioned above",
    "there are two more elastic processes , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which contribute to the enhancement of high-@xmath0 heavy quarks by accelerating slowly moving heavy quarks from the medium .",
    "we use the distribution function of heavy quarks obtained from perturbative qcd calculations in pb+pb collisions at @xmath39=5.5 tev ( shown in the next section ) to estimate the conversion width for a quark or gluon into a heavy quark via these compton - like processes .",
    "it turns out that their contribution to high-@xmath0 heavy quark production is two orders of magnitude smaller than that from the gluon annihilation process @xmath7 due to the mass mismatch in the initial state .",
    "this is true when we require the momentum of the outgoing heavy quark to be larger than half of the momentum of the incoming light flavor jet . when this constraint is lifted a much larger conversion rate is obtained , however , with a much smaller average momentum gain for the final state heavy quark which seems irrelevant for the high-@xmath0 sector .",
    "thus we neglect the contributions from compton - like elastic processes in the following .    in this work",
    "we follow the procedure outlined for light quark and gluons in @xcite .",
    "the leading order matrix elements are scaled by a factor @xmath6 = 4 which was needed to reproduce the observed @xmath40 and @xmath41 ratios .",
    "ultimately , however , the drag and diffusion coefficients have to be extracted from data and compared to a variety of perturbative and non - perturbative predictions .",
    "a large @xmath6-factor as used here , if found compatible with data , might rather hint toward a much stronger jet - medium coupling than expected from perturbation theory .",
    "now we turn to charm and bottom production in au+au collisions at rhic with a center - of - mass energy @xmath42 gev .",
    "the initial @xmath0 spectra of charm and bottom quarks at mid - rapidity are taken from ref .",
    "both are obtained by multiplying the heavy quark @xmath0-spectra from @xmath1 collisions at the same energy by the number of binary collisions ( @xmath43 ) in central au+au collisions .    for the dynamics of the fireball , we assume that it evolves boost invariantly in the longitudinal direction but with an accelerated transverse expansion .",
    "specifically , its volume expands in the proper time @xmath44 according to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the transverse radius with an initial value @xmath47=7 fm , @xmath48=0.6 fm is the qgp formation time , and @xmath49/fm is the transverse acceleration @xcite . with an initial temperature @xmath50 mev and using thermal masses for quarks and gluons , this model gives a total transverse energy comparable to that measured in experiments .",
    "the time dependence of the temperature is then obtained from entropy conservation , and the critical temperature @xmath51 mev is reached at proper time @xmath52 fm .    to solve eq .",
    "[ langevin ] , we follow the test particle methods introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the propagation of light flavored jets and heavy quarks in the qgp medium .",
    "the light flavors can convert into each other or into heavy quarks according to the probabilities discussed above in @xcite .",
    "the conversion of heavy quarks into light flavors is suppressed and not taken into account , except for the process @xmath53 which is included in the drag coefficient . in fig .",
    "[ heavy_conv ] we show the ratio of heavy quarks obtained from jet conversions to that obtained from initial hard collisions with energy loss included .",
    "the jet conversions contribute about 10% to the spectrum of charm quarks at high @xmath0 , and only 0.3% to that of bottom quarks in central au+au collisions at rhic .    for lhc energies we take the initial @xmath0 spectra of charm and bottom quarks at midrapidity from the perturbative calculation in refs .",
    "@xcite multiplied by the number of binary collisions ( @xmath54 1700 @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra are parametrized as @xmath55\\right)^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dn_b}{d^2 p_t}&=&38\\left(1+\\frac{p_t}{2.0}\\right)^{-5.6 } \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{10}{0.8+p_t}\\right)^3\\right]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters of the fireball are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite where thermal charm production at lhc was studied .",
    "specifically , we choose initial proper time @xmath56 fm/@xmath57 for the formation of the equilibrated qgp with initial temperature @xmath58 mev . in fig .",
    "[ heavy_con_lhc ] , we show the ratio of heavy quark yields from jet conversions to that from initial hard collisions with energy loss included .",
    "the ratios are similar in magnitude magnitude to what has been obtained for rhic .",
    "we can now answer the two questions that we have posed at the beginning .",
    "first , the promotion of heavy quarks from the medium to high @xmath0 is not an effective mechanism for the production of high-@xmath0 charm and bottom quarks .",
    "this is compatible with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "note that we have used the same framework and @xmath6-factors which led to the prediction of a sizable strange quark excess at high-@xmath0 at rhic . on the other hand",
    ", we have found that the corresponding process for charm quarks at lhc is not efficient .",
    "this can be traced back to the relatively large amount of initial charm in jets produced at lhc and the missing chemical equilibration of charm in the qgp .",
    "note that some authors have argued recently that thermal charm production might occur at the temperatures reached at lhc @xcite .",
    "we have chosen not to include this scenario here .",
    "we have studied the impact of jet conversions on the production of high-@xmath0 heavy quarks in heavy ion collisions . based on leading order perturbative qcd , we calculated transport coefficients of heavy quarks , and studied their propagation in an expanding qgp medium .",
    "we find that the dominant conversion process is pair production off gluon jets in the medium , @xmath7 .",
    "however , the contribution of jet conversions to the total yields of heavy quarks at high @xmath0 is rather small both at rhic and lhc .",
    "this is consistent with measurements of single electrons at moderate values of @xmath0 at rhic . on the other hand",
    ", it implies that high-@xmath0 charm quarks at lhc as a probe for the mean free path in the medium might not be as useful as strangeness is at rhic energies .",
