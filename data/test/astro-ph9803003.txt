    "in recent years , an increasing attention has been devoted to an accurate estimation of electron screening effect for nuclear fusion reactions in stellar plasma and for the interactions of low - energy ion beams with atomic or molecular targets in laboratory experiments ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in this letter",
    "we present the first quantum mechanical calculation of screening effect by bound electron in @xmath4 nuclear fusion from the pp - cycle in the sun .",
    "contribution of this reaction into the the total luminosity of the sun is negligible small , but it is directly related to the long - standing `` solar neutrino problem '' ,  one of the most intriguing issue in the present - day neutrino astrophysics .",
    "standard physics can not explain an @xmath5ar production rate in the chlorine experiment smaller than that expected from the solar @xmath2b neutrino flux measured by both kamiokande and ( with better statistic ) super kamiokande .",
    "gallex and sage experiments also indicate beryllium neutrino deficit ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "one of the most elegant solutions to the solar neutrino anomaly is resonant neutrino flavor conversion in the sun , that is the so - called msw effect  @xcite .",
    "it requires an extension of the minimal standard electroweak theory : neutrino masses and neutrino mixing .",
    "these neutrino oscillation parameters are determined in a way that can bridge between the predictions of the standard solar models and the solar neutrino observations .",
    "thus , even in the framework of the standard solar model within a hypothesis of neutrino oscillation ( and msw effect ) , it is apparently needed more precise calculations of nuclear fusion rates in the sun , because they can significantly affect the neutrino oscillation parameters determination .",
    "a careful study of electron screening effect on nuclear fusion rates becomes particularly actual in view of expected high accuracy neutrino flux measurements by a number of new large detectors ( super kamiokande , sno ) .",
    "the interpretation of forthcoming data requires relevant precise calculations of solar neutrino fluxes and neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "usually , the effects of surrounding plasma on the nuclear fusion are treated in electrostatic screening approximation .",
    "this approximation , being classical or quantum , correctly reflects the major properties of a process only for high relative velocity of the colliding nuclei , when electron density in the vicinity of the fusing nuclei remains almost unchanged during the collision . in the case ,",
    "when relative velocity of the nuclei is much smaller or comparable with the electron one ( and this is the case at solar conditions ) , the electron density changes following any relative configuration of the nuclei , and the electrons have an impact on a kinetic energy shift of the nuclei .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the phenomenon within the framework of the adiabatic approximation , which comes from the well known born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation .",
    "the bo approximation allows one to treat nuclear motion independently from the electron coordinate , within a new effective potential which depends on the internuclear distance . since , the considered nuclear velocities are smaller than the boun electron one , corrections to the bo approximation are expected to be negligible . obviously , the fusing nuclei are from the continuum energy spectrum .",
    "an accurate treatment within the adiabatic approximation of the screening effect by electrons from continuum spectrum requires an additional research but the case of bound electrons presents no special problem ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as it was argued by a.  dar , g.  shaviv , and n.  shaviv  @xcite , the commonly accepted debye - hckel theory is not quite adequate for evaluating the screening effect in not - very - dense stars , like the sun",
    ". there is , also , an experimental evidence that this theory does not provide correct answer for the screening  @xcite . actually , this fact is of no importance when the screening due to the plasma electrons is by itself rather small .",
    "but it is not the case for the low - lying bound electrons which do screen the electric charge of nuclei much effectively , and moreover , the screening effect drastically increases when energy of the fusing ions decreases .",
    "the electron screening can have dramatic effects in very dense stellar cores .    at low and moderate energies , the fusion cross section of `` bare ''",
    "charged nuclei colliding with the relative momenta @xmath6 in the center - of - mass frame is expressed as ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the so - called astrophysical factor which incorporates all nuclear features of the process , @xmath9 is the collision energy of the nuclei , @xmath10 is the usual coulomb parameter , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron and reduced nuclear masses , respectively , and @xmath13 is the hydrogen bohr radius .",
    "the exponential factor originates from the coulomb wave function of the internuclear motion @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "the screened cross section @xmath16 differs by the enhancement factor @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the wave function of the internuclear motion which accounts for the bound electron .",
    "we evaluate the effect of electron screening of @xmath3be nucleus by one bound electron in reaction ( [ creation ] ) in the framework of the adiabatic approximation for three particle problem .",
    "this calculation is compared with two relevant approximations , `` united atom '' ( ua ) and folding approximations which , as we will demonstrate below , give respectively upper and lower estimates for the screening effect . in the framework of the ua approximation",
    "we estimate also the screening effect for @xmath3be nucleus with two k - shell electrons .",
    "we treat the coulomb problem for three particles in the framework of the adiabatic representation , that consists as follows .",
    "the three particle schrdinger equation solution @xmath19 is represented as @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the internuclear radius - vector , and @xmath22 is the electron radius - vector from the center - of - mass of nuclei .",
    "the two - center eigenfunctions @xmath23 are derived from the schrdinger equation for three particles , when two nuclei are fixed on a distance @xmath24 , and the eigenfunctions have a dependence on @xmath24 as a parameter .",
    "the electron energy eigenvalue @xmath25 also depends on the internuclear distance .",
    "the nuclei with electric charges @xmath26 and @xmath27 interact with the effective potential @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the eigenfunctions of nuclear motion in the potential ( [ potential ] )",
    ". we shall write the parameters in atomic units , except that we shall display the units .",
    "thus , the energy unit is @xmath30 ev , the lenght unit is @xmath31 , and the electric charge unit is @xmath32 .",
    "our approximation consists in using only one two - center eigenfunction corresponding to the ground state of the system .",
    "obviously , the main screening effect is reached at zero orbital moment of the colliding nuclei .",
    "thus , the fusing nuclei are considered in @xmath33-wave .",
    "there are some arguments for this approximation . at first , the high energy states corrections ( at fixed @xmath24 ) are of the order of @xmath34 . then , excited energy levels correspond to the less energy of the united nucleus .",
    "it leads to their exponentially small contribution into the nuclear fusion rate in comparison with the ground state of the system . at least , only the ground state energy of the electron in the field of two nuclei ( @xmath3be and p in our case ) , labeled as @xmath35 therm ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) has the correct asymptotic behaviour ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the total three particle wave function reads : @xmath36 the tabulated values of @xmath25  @xcite are used for our purposes .",
    "the ground state eigenvalue energy @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , with zero quantum numbers , has the correct asymptotic behaviour : the electron eigenvalue energy reaches the energy of the united ion as @xmath24 approaches zero : @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( that is the energy of the isolated ion @xmath41 ) . in fig .",
    "[ beterm ] the values for the ground state are plotted .",
    "we solved numerically the schrdinger equation for two scattering nuclei with @xmath42 and @xmath43 at center - of - mass kinetic energy @xmath9 within the potential ( [ potential ] ) with zero quantum numbers @xmath44 .",
    "the numerical solution was obtained on the mesh on @xmath24 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 in numerov s scheme .",
    "we varied integration step @xmath47 and @xmath48 in order to ensure that final result is not changed substantially . also for checking purposes we reproduced the value of @xmath49 substituting @xmath50 .",
    "the values of the squared wave function of relative motion of the two nuclei @xmath51 at @xmath52 kev @xmath53 kev are calculated and compared with @xmath54 .",
    "the ua approximation can serve as an upper limit to the screening corrections induced by bound electron .",
    "the essence of this approximation is replacement of the kinetic energy @xmath9 by the shifted energy @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the energy difference of the bound electron between the final and initial states . for one bound electron",
    "this energy difference is given by @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the ua approximation changes @xmath49 to @xmath58 . since the classical turning point for the ionic barrier penetration is at much smaller radius than the bohr radius ( @xmath59 ) at solar energies , the nuclear fusion takes place , in the main , within the united ion state .",
    "the classical turning point is given by : @xmath60 therefore , at solar energies , the ua approximation applicability is well satisfied .",
    "moreover , at kinetic energies above few kev , @xmath37 is not changed substantially at @xmath61 , and the ua approximation is expected to be very close to the exact solution .",
    "the ua approximation replaces decreasing @xmath37 ( see in fig .",
    "[ beterm ] ) by the constant @xmath56 , hence , this approximation serves as an upper estimate .",
    "the folding approximation can be used as a lower limit to the screening corrections .",
    "this approximation embodies the static wave function of the bound electron , which does not depend on the internuclear distance .",
    "the total three particle wave function in this approximation is presented as a product : @xmath62 where the wave function for the electron bounded on the nucleus with electric charge",
    "@xmath26 reads : @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the wave function of the two nuclei . averaging the electron coordinates ,",
    "@xmath64 can be derived from the schrdinger equation with the potential : @xmath65 the zero point of the colliding nuclei kinetic energy is the electron eigenvalue energy in the field of @xmath26 nucleus .",
    "obviously , a rigid electron wave function , which has no dependence on @xmath24 , can be used only in the case of instantaneous impact of the nuclei .",
    "thus , the area of the folding approximation applicability is the faster velocity of the nuclei relative to the electron one .",
    "attractive part of the potential @xmath66 reaches the value : @xmath67 as @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 that is the value of the electron energy in united ion , the folding approximation gives a lower estimate for the enhancement factor .",
    "the enhancement factor ( [ gamma ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ enhan ] for all three approximations .",
    "as it was expected , the ua approximation always overestimate the exact solution , while the folding approximation underestimates it .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to see that simple ua prescription gives very close values to the exact solution at kinetic energies above @xmath70 kev .",
    "therefore , the latter can be used not only as a qualitative , but as a good quantitative approximation to the electron screening by bound electrons .",
    "the electron screening is dramatic at very low kinetic energies of the nuclei .",
    "however , in a plasma , most of the nuclear fusions come at the gamow peak energy , that is defined by the strong dependence of the nuclear cross section on energy ( [ sigma ] ) and the fast decrease of the exponential particle distribution .",
    "this energy is given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 k , @xmath73 is the proton mass . in the solar interior at @xmath74 , where the @xmath3be and @xmath2b neutrino production reaches its maximum  @xcite ,",
    "the plasma parameters are @xmath75 , the electron density @xmath76 , and the gamow peak energy in reaction ( [ creation ] ) is about @xmath77 kev",
    ". then @xmath78 , that is , there is 10% of an enhancement by one bound electron in the bohron production rate .",
    "simple computations within the ua approximation give the screening effect as : @xmath79    then , 10% of an enhancement by one bound electron could be easily reproduced just inserting numbers into the formula ( [ screen ] ) .",
    "one can apply this formula also for a @xmath3be nucleus with two bound electrons . then , @xmath80 here , @xmath81",
    "ev and @xmath82  ev are , respectively , the fifth and forth ionization potential of the @xmath2b atom and @xmath83  ev and @xmath84  ev are , respectively , the forth and third ionization potential of the @xmath3be atom .",
    "thus , two bound electrons enhancement factor is given by @xmath85 , i.e. roughly 20% .",
    "using the saha equation iben , kalata and schwartz  @xcite calculated the probabilities @xmath86 and @xmath87 that one or two k - shell electrons are associated with any given @xmath3be nucleus .",
    "the calculations were perfomed under the assumption of pure coulomb electron - ion forces , neglecting all excited states and screening .",
    "the probabilites found are @xmath88^{-1 } , \\\\",
    "f_2 & = & 0.25\\lambda\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{\\delta_\\chi}{kt}\\right)}f_1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath91  ev . inserting numbers one can obtain : @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .    using the calculated abundances of @xmath3be ions , one can estimate the thermal averaged screening effect induced by both one and two bound electrons on a @xmath3be nucleus : @xmath94 in the standard solar model ( ssm ) the electron capture rate by @xmath3be nucleus is taken to be about 1000 times faster than the proton capture rate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a small change in @xmath2b production rate does not affect significantly the @xmath3be neutrino flux , although it makes a proportional change in @xmath2b neutrino flux .",
    "thus , the electron screening by bound electrons has the prompt consequences on bohron neutrino flux .",
    "the electron screening by plasma electrons from the continuum spectrum is expected to contribute significantly to the total enhancement factor , since it is proportional to @xmath95 , and thus it has to be taken into account in the exact prediction of neutrino flux change .    in summary , in the solar interior k - shell",
    "bound electrons enhance @xmath3be(p,@xmath1)@xmath2b rate and increase @xmath2b neutrino production rate by of about 4%",
    ". therefore , bound electron screening has an effect on the solar @xmath2b neutrinos , and acts with the opposite effect to the berrylium neutrinos .",
    "the main essence of the electron screening in nuclear fusions is the change in electron density on a nucleus during the collision of the nuclei .",
    "this effect can be treated only in a dynamical calculation like the present three particle calculation or the discussed ua approximation ."
