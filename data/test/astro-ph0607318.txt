    "diffuse emission in the infrared seems like a perfect laboratory to study the dynamics of the interstellar medium .",
    "recent large - scale surveys by the spitzer space telescope , specifically the glimpse project @xcite have provided us with unprecedented high resolution data of the diffuse emission in the mid - infrared ( mir ) . at first glance",
    "the wealth of structure exhibited in the flux density maps seems a striking argument by itself for structure analysis .    however , the conspicuous structures themselves  namely shells , bubbles , filaments and dark clouds ( see e.g. @xcite ) raise the question of how much of the observed structure actually corresponds to physical structure .",
    "flux density maps contain information about volume density , column density and excitation , but to extract one of them is only possible under assumptions .",
    "for the structure analysis , ideally , we are interested in volume density , which is accessible only indirectly , leaving us with column density as a second best at most .",
    "in fact , over a broad range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared , the opportunities seem to be rather rare where we can interpret observed intensity maps of diffuse emission as information about the underlying column density structure . more often than not the medium is optically thick for the emitted radiation , or denser components of the ism act as absorbers .",
    "optical depth effects become weaker with increasing wavelength , which is why the mid - ir (  @xmath2 m ) takes a somewhat special position ( for a study of correlation between emission and column density in the far - ir see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . at longer wavelengths from the far - ir through millimeter , current observatories have rather poor spatial resolution , precluding study of small - scale interstellar structure . with a dust / pah extinction cross section of @xmath3@xmath4 per h - atom @xcite ,",
    "the optical depth for mir emission in molecular clouds should range below or around @xmath5 , which would encourage a direct interpretation of flux density as column density . for the near - infrared ( nir ) this possibility has been discussed and supported by @xcite to interpret so - called `` cloudshine '' observations by @xcite , although there , the column densities would have to be substantially smaller than in the mir .",
    "although applicable to a wider range of surveys , this paper focuses on the mir diffuse emission as seen by the irac camera of the spitzer space telescope . to a large extent , the emission in the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] bands comes from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( to a lesser extent they also contribute to the [ 3.6 ] band , @xcite ) , mostly excited in the environment of nearby uv sources .",
    "two ( not unrelated ) issues are raised in the mir : ( 1 ) the medium is generally optically thick for the soft uv - radiation longward of @xmath6 that excites the pah emission .",
    "thus , only the outer layers of any structures  unless really diffuse  are excited and thereby traced out in the mir , giving the object a filamentary appearance .",
    "( 2 ) observationally , there seems to be a strong morphological bias to shells in the pah - emission .",
    "these could be dynamical shells ( see e.g. @xcite ) , like e.g. windblown bubbles or hii regions .",
    "however , the destruction of pahs around the uv source could also lead to a shell - like structure . and finally , these shells could be irradiation effects as noted under ( 1 ) .",
    "and , of course , a combination of mechanisms is possible also .",
    "moreover , the usual projection problem introduces a bias to interpreting objects as being two - dimensional , while they could be very `` 3d '' : more diffuse material gets ionized or blown away first , leaving the ubiquitous elephant trunk remnant structures ( for an impressive example of this problem see the glimpse study of rcw49 , @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate the appearance of a model molecular cloud in the radiation field of a nearby uv - source , in order to quantify the correspondence of various measures and tracers between the original column density maps and the derived flux density maps .",
    "rescaling the density range in the models allows us to mimic different physical environments , from diffuse clouds to dense molecular clouds and cores .",
    "the appearance of the original cloud can be completely altered by irradiation . only for densities of up to @xmath7@xmath1 can the flux density actually be interpreted as column density . above that",
    ", mir self - extinction and strong shadowing effects in the uv will let the maps diverge .",
    "however , even for the highest density range ( up to @xmath8@xmath1 ) , where the flux density maps bear no resemblance to the column density , the structural properties of the original column density distribution still can be retrieved from the flux density .",
    "our results demonstrate that the diffuse emission data as made available by glimpse can serve as a powerful means to analyze the ( dynamical ) structure of the interstellar medium .",
    "this study aims at pointing out possible pitfalls and at giving a rule - of - thumb estimate where flux density structure could be trusted to represent column density . in the next section (  [ s : glimpse ] ) , we will give some observational motivation in the form of diffuse emission maps from the glimpse data .",
    "we are deferring the full structure analysis of the glimpse data to a future paper . the models and the details of the radiative transfer treatment",
    "are described in  [ s : irradmodels ] .",
    "the results (  [ s : results ] ) are summarized in  [ s : summary ] .",
    "the following maps are extracted from images of the glimpse project .",
    "the data were processed through the glimpse pipeline reduction system @xcite .",
    "point sources were extracted from each frame using a modified version of daophot @xcite , and the individual residual ( i.e without point sources ) frames produced by daophot were mosaicked .",
    "only sources fit well by a stellar point - spread - function ( psf ) were extracted . thus saturated and",
    "near - saturated stars remain in the images .",
    "in addition , there are some artifacts resulting from point - source subtractions due to the undersampling of the stellar psf at irac wavelengths . figures 1 - 5 show [ 8.0 ] residual mosaic images displayed in galactic coordinates .",
    "we will split the maps into three categories : volume illumination (  [ ss : volumeillum ] ) , absorption and shadowing (  [ ss : darkclouds ] ) , and high - density environments (  [ ss : highdens ] ) .",
    "figures  [ f : g51.8 + 0.6 ] and [ f : g343.5 - 0.3 ] show two examples of `` volume - filling '' diffuse emission , i.e. the optical - depth effect described in  [ s : motivation ] does not seem to be the dominant structure generation mechanism . rather , it seems , the diffuse emission traces the volume density . while figure  [ f : g51.8 + 0.6 ] shows a clear shell - like structure , figure  [ f : g343.5 - 0.3 ] exhibits dark filaments , probably extinction in the mir against a bright diffuse background .",
    "the volume illumination could either stem from material that is optically thin for the exciting uv provided by a nearby star or by the interstellar radiation field ( fig .",
    "[ f : g343.5 - 0.3 ] ) , or arise in an environment which  although at higher densities  contains several uv - sources , so that we still see large parts of the volume in pah - emission ( fig .",

    "]    residual image of diffuse emission at [ 8.0 ] micron , centered on @xmath10 . ]",
    "figures  [ f : g26.9 - 0.3 ] and [ f : g309.1 - 0.4 ] give two examples of structures that are typical of the glimpse data : the combination of bright and dark features in one and the same object .            in figure",
    "[ f : g26.9 - 0.3 ] , the ( galactic ) north side of the filament is seen in emission , while the south side shows dark structures .",
    "figure  [ f : g309.1 - 0.4 ] displays a structure composed of bright vertical filaments , which may be an example of volume illumination ( see previous section ) , while the object in question is located at smaller longitudes @xmath11 than the filament , at @xmath12 : the left side is emitting , while the right side is seen as dark structure .",
    "in contrast , the top of the same figure shows a `` pure '' dark cloud , without any irradiation features .",
    "the reader will find more examples in the other frames .",
    "this raises the question of whether we see two physically distinct classes of objects here , or whether the `` bright - dark '' clouds are just an illuminated version of the classic dark clouds .",
    "the `` bright - dark '' clouds can often be associated with irradiating sources ( see @xcite ) , so that we will identify the two morphological classes as one and the same type of object , namely dark clouds .",
    "the region around @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ f : g30.7 - 0.0 ] ) shows one of the many bubbles in the glimpse data @xcite . bright dust / pah emission and dark clouds form an intricately structured network .",
    "the northern part of the bubble exhibits several shell - like structures , whose brightness tapers off to the diffuse background more or less immediately .",
    "the region is compact and contains a lot of dark extinction regions in the bright emission regions , indicating that this is a high - density environment .",
    "note , however , that darker regions in emission could also just mean that the pahs have been destroyed around the uv source .",
    "volume illumination seems to play less of a role here , instead , the rim effects mentioned in the introduction seem to have come into full play .",
    "we employed two model series : series a is meant to resemble star formation regions in the galactic disk .",
    "it is derived from cloud dispersal models in a turbulent flow @xcite , and corresponds to a box length of @xmath14  pc , a background density of @xmath15  @xmath1 , and a cloud density of @xmath16  @xmath1 .",
    "model a is in approximate pressure equilibrium , with a temperature of @xmath17  k in the ambient medium .",
    "the model is not self - gravitating .",
    "series b stems from self - gravitating mhd - turbulence models in a periodic box @xcite .",
    "it is intended to be typical for conditions within a molecular cloud , with a box size of @xmath18  pc and a mean density of @xmath19  @xmath1 , an ( isothermal ) temperature of @xmath20  k and a turbulent _ rms _ velocity of @xmath5  km  s@xmath21 .",
    "as we will see below , self - gravitation has already lead to core formation .",
    "both model series a and b have a resolution of @xmath22 grid cells .",
    "the density contrast can be adapted to test irradiation effects in various environments .",
    "the uv - source is assumed to be a o5v star that can be placed anywhere in the simulation domain .",
    "note that we are just investigating the radiation paths of the stellar uv - photons .",
    "the models do not account for ionization or stellar winds , and thus can not provide us with estimates how they would affect the emission structure .",
    "we further assume that only uv - photons with @xmath23 are available for pah - excitation , and that photons with shorter wavelength have already been absorbed within the hii region around the star .",
    "we follow the photons on rays through the simulation domain .",
    "the discretization in longitude and latitude follows the healpix prescription @xcite in order to guarantee equal areas for each ray .",
    "rays are traced within a tree - structure such that optical depths are known locally at each node of the tree .",
    "the number of rays is determined by the number of cells on a sphere with radius @xmath24 ( in grid cells ) as @xmath25 .",
    "thus , each cell on a given sphere gets at least one ray .",
    "densities are interpolated bi - linearly .    for each location @xmath26 ,",
    "the energy loss is determined by @xmath27 with the central ( stellar ) luminosity @xmath28 and the local optical depth ( measured from the uv source ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the atomic hydrogen particle density , and @xmath31@xmath32 is the pah absorption cross section per h - atom .",
    "the factor @xmath33 accounts for the ray splitting : the base level consists of @xmath34 rays , each of which spawns @xmath35 children at the next refinement level @xmath11 .",
    "the radial step size is @xmath36 , thus the volume at each location is known , and @xmath37 can be multiplied by the corresponding volume expression , resulting in the actual uv - energy loss .",
    "we integrated over the whole uv - spectrum of the incident radiation field between @xmath6 and @xmath38 ( see e.g. @xcite , fig .",
    "1 ) with the constant absorption cross section @xmath39 given above .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all absorbed uv - energy is converted into pah emission , which we distribute according to the pah - spectrum by @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite the spectrum is independent of the radiation field over a large range in intensity .",
    "the emitted spectrum , sampled at @xmath40 wavelengths , is convolved with the irac response function @xcite for band 4 at @xmath41 $ ] micron , which contains the bulk of the pah emission @xcite .",
    "the resulting `` gray '' emission is integrated along the line of sight ( i.e. along a chosen grid axis ) following the equation of radiative transfer , including emission and extinction , with an extinction cross section @xmath42  @xmath4 per h - atom .",
    "the chosen absorption and extinction cross sections @xmath43 and @xmath44 are a factor of @xmath45 smaller relative to the values given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they give values of @xmath46  @xmath4 and @xmath47  @xmath4 .",
    "the slightly smaller cross sections can be accommodated by rescaling the density .",
    "note , however , that in both cases the cross sections for uv and mir differ by a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , material which is optically thick at uv can be optically thin at the re - emitted mir .",
    "in fact , it is to a large extent this difference that leads to the wealth of structure in the observed mir diffuse emission .",
    "the irradiation effects will alter the appearance of the cloud , depending on gas density and geometry (  [ ss : morphologies ] ) .",
    "the ( point ) source needs to be subtracted (  [ ss : intensdist ] ) to permit a meaningful analysis of the spatial structure (  [ ss : spatstruct ] ) and to facilitate a test of the traditional structure analysis tools , namely power spectra (  [ sss : powspec ] ) and structure functions (  [ sss : structfunc ] ) .",
    "the overall correlation between column density and flux density deteriorates with increasing volume density (  [ ss : correl ] ) . under certain conditions ,",
    "the flux density maps can even be used to trace the three - dimensional structure of the cloud (  [ ss : pahemissedge ] ) .",
    "we begin by discussing the morphology of the irradiated objects depending on the source s position and the density contrast .",
    "the appearance of the irradiated cloud depends strongly on the absolute gas density and on the location of the source .",
    "figures  [ f : irradclouda0 ]  [ f : irradclouda3 ] give a first impression of the appearance of an irradiated cloud .",
    "the top row of each figure shows the column density along each of the three cartesian axes .",
    "each column stands for one of the cartesian axes along which the pictures have been taken .",
    "the first digit of the labels in the panels gives the model series name ( a or b ) .",
    "the second digit stands for the position of the star along the @xmath49-axis in units of @xmath50 , where @xmath51  pc is the box length .",
    "a value of @xmath5 in the first column of images means that @xmath52 of the box length is between the observer and the star , e.g. panel a1x0 represents a situation where the source is located between observer and most of the cloud , and thus the cloud `` face '' in the plane of sky as seen by the observer is irradiated .",
    "thus , in the left column , the star is moved along the line of sight , and in the center and right columns , it is moved from left to right . the cloud itself is contained in approximately the central half of the box . the third digit ( @xmath53 ) gives the cartesian coordinate axis along which the model has been projected .",
    "the last digit denotes the logarithm of the density contrast enhancement above the contrast already existing in the simulation , i.e. a value of @xmath54 denotes a density contrast enhancement of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , columns are a sequence in position , rows are a sequence in line - of - sight orientation , and each of the four figures  [ f : irradclouda0 ]  [ f : irradclouda3 ] contains frames of a fixed density contrast .",
    "the densities range between @xmath5@xmath1 at the edge of the box ( in the `` inter - cloud medium '' ) and @xmath55@xmath1 within the cloud for a contrast enhancement of @xmath5 , and between @xmath5 and @xmath56@xmath1 for a contrast enhancement of @xmath57 .",
    "question marks ( `` ? '' ) in the model names act as group specifications , e.g. a??0 refers to all panels in figure  [ f : irradclouda0 ] , whereas a?x0 refers to the panels at varying star position , projected along the @xmath49-axis ( i.e. left column of figure  [ f : irradclouda0 ] ) .                    for a density contrast of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ f : irradclouda0 ] ) , the cloud s column density structure is well traced by the pah - emission .",
    "the object is still optically thin enough for the uv photons to excite its whole volume .",
    "panel a3x0 and the row a?y0 show slight self - extinction of the pah - emission ( slightly darkened regions within the cloud ) .",
    "the model sequence a??0 could be compared to figures  [ f : g51.8 + 0.6 ] and [ f : g343.5 - 0.3 ] .",
    "the extinction structures get more pronounced at the next higher density contrast of @xmath20 or a density range @xmath58  @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ f : irradclouda1 ] ) .",
    "panels a??1 tell us more about these regions : the dark structures are a combination of uv - absorption _ and _ mir extinction .",
    "since the star is moving away from the observer from panel a1x1 to panel a3x1 , the dark fuzzy region in a3x1 must be located between the star and the observer .",
    "if it were solely due to uv - absorption , it should show up as a `` bright '' ( light gray ) region in the pah - emission .",
    "the fact that it is dark in the pah - emission maps thus shows that it is not only a uv - shadowing effect , but that it is also dense enough to extinct the background mir radiation .",
    "a similar effect can be seen in panel a3z1 , at the lower left of the cloud .",
    "the region is uv - shadowed by the bulk of the cloud , however , in contrast to a3x1 , the optical depth in the mir is smaller , so that while the background mir is extincted , its brightness is close to the background brightness .",
    "as one can see in the corresponding column density map above a3z1 , the region is still within the cloud , i.e. there remains gas available for extinction of the mir .",
    "a wisp of denser gas in front of the shadowed region is irradiated by the source , showing up in lighter gray .",
    "the effect of the background intensity will be discussed for the model series b.    increasing the density contrast further to @xmath48 , corresponding to a density range of @xmath59  @xmath1 , ( fig .",
    "[ f : irradclouda2 ] , panels a??2 ) leads to stronger absorption , and in some cases to complete shadowing .",
    "simultaneously , the diffuse gas  still mostly optically thin for the uv photons  gets brighter .",
    "overall , the maps seem to be more `` structured '' than their lower density counterparts , which is partly an effect of the combination of emission and extinction , and partly because at higher densities , smaller changes in density are traced out .",
    "that shadowing effects play a large role can be seen in figures  [ f : irradclouda1 ] and [ f : irradclouda2 ] ( models a??1 and a??2 ) .",
    "moreover , the spatial structure of the cloud continues from the emission regions to the extinction regions ( panel a1z2 ) , an effect often seen in the diffuse emission maps ( see the examples in  [ ss : darkclouds ] as well as @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ f : irradclouda3 ] , panels a??3 stands for the extreme case : it corresponds to a molecular cloud with densities ranging up to @xmath60 @xmath1 . except for the close vicinity around the star , the object stays dark :",
    "all the uv is absorbed directly ( see row a2[x , y , z]3 ) . in panel a3?3 , we actually catch a glimpse of the far side of the cloud : the irradiating source is on the far side of the cloud , and while the cloud is optically thick to the exciting uv , it is still ( marginally ) optically thin for the pah - emission .",
    "the `` dark fuzzy '' region discussed in a3x1 is still visible and has acquired a `` halo '' of excited pahs .",
    "the irradiation by the central star introduces shell - like patterns in an object that does not have any shell structure whatsoever ( see column density panels on top of figure ) : especially , panel a1z3 gives the impression of a star sitting in a 3d - shell .",
    "in other words , it is relatively simple to confuse such structures with the signposts of interaction between a star and its surrounding medium ( although  obviously  it does not rule out such an interaction ) .",
    "this situation reminds one of the shell - like structures north of @xmath13 , figure  [ f : g30.7 - 0.0 ] .",
    "model a1z3 in a zoomed - in view .",
    "the central source is now located in the upper left corner .",
    "over - plotted are two rays through the column density and flux density map respectively , whose profiles are shown in the top and bottom panel .",
    "vertical lines denote points of local maxima in the flux density along the ray . in order to help identification in the maps",
    ", these points are marked with small vertical lines on the ray .",
    "not all flux density maxima have corresponding column density maxima . to identify the shell - like structures more easily , compare to panel a1z3 in figure  [ f : irradclouda3 ] .",
    "]    figure  [ f : pahcuts ] presents a closer look at a sub - region of panel a1z3 in order to learn more about the mechanisms that lead to the shell - like structures in the flux density maps .",
    "the two center panels show the column density and the flux density , where the central source is now located in the upper left corner of the frames . for an identification of the shell",
    ", it helps to compare this figure to panel a1z3 of figure  [ f : irradclouda3 ] .",
    "the top and bottom panels show column and flux density profiles for two rays indicated on the gray - scale maps .",
    "vertical lines denote local maxima in the flux density , marked as well on the gray - scale maps by short vertical lines .",
    "generally , we would expect emission peaks at locations where the radial volume density gradient is positive , and its curvature negative .",
    "however , of the three locations , one does not follow this expectation : we observe an emission peak for a negative _ column _ density gradient .",
    "since enhanced emission can only occur at positive radial density gradients , this might seem surprising , but it only tells us that the flux density maps in fact trace out the 3d structure of the cloud : while the overall column density drops with increasing distance from the source , a local density enhancement ( most likely in the foreground because otherwise it would be masked ) leads to the peak in the flux density .",
    "thus , the shell - like structure observed here has nothing to do with a physical shell , but is a result of a lucky combination of smaller density enhancements predominantly located in the foreground .",
    "observationally , such objects could be distinguished from physical shells by comparing them at other wavelengths , e.g. in the dust continuum at @xmath61 micron .",
    "we have to mention a caveat here , though .",
    "our models do not account for pah destruction in the vicinity of the star .",
    "this would introduce a further bias towards shell - like structures , independent of any dynamical effects such as stellar winds or hii regions .",
    "while the overall resemblance between observed flux density maps and the modeled ones ( e.g. a??2 ) is suggestive , there is nevertheless one striking difference : the modeled maps exhibit dark radial streaks caused by the total absorption of uv and thus the lack of pah emission along those rays .",
    "such structures are generally not observed , for the following reasons : ( 1 ) in the observed maps , the lines of sight are substantially longer than in the models , and thus diffuse material in the foreground and/or background will lead to a much higher uniform flux , which easily would cover any faint low - brightness structures .",
    "( 2 ) the restriction to one source and neglecting the interstellar radiation field introduces a directional bias in our models which then leads to the shadows seen in the models .",
    "only if the absorbing material is directly between the observer and the source can shadowing effects be observed , namely as dark clouds .",
    "clearly , the overall correspondence between column density maps and the pah - emission maps deteriorates for increasing densities .",
    "figure  [ f : irradcloudb ] is a variation on the previous theme , namely flux density maps of a self - gravitating turbulent medium , irradiated by a star .",
    "as before , a sequence in increasing density contrast is shown .",
    "one difference between model a and b is obvious : model b does not exhibit a well - defined irradiated cloud structure ( or at least the rims of that ) .",
    "one could see model b as a `` close - up '' of model a , taken of a small region around the star inside the cloud of model a. in model b , the uv - radiation is mainly stopped by the numerous filaments arising from shock compressions .",
    "in addition to those filamentary structures , the emission has a `` fog - like '' appearance : in contrast to model a , the density within the cloud is already high enough to absorb sufficient uv to trace even low - density regions , and the scales of the frame are smaller by a factor of nearly @xmath62 , so that we are seeing the close environment around the o - star .",
    "the small black objects visible at the higher density contrasts are self - gravitating cores that have already collapsed .",
    "while it is possible to identify irradiated filaments with structure in the column density map ( top ) , the overall agreement between flux density and column density ( even for the lowest contrasts ) is rather poor .",
    "the densities range between @xmath20 and @xmath63@xmath1 in the original density distribution ( density contrast enhancement of @xmath64 , model b??0 ) .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath5 then corresponds to a maximum density of @xmath65@xmath1 , @xmath54 to @xmath60@xmath1 and finally @xmath57 to @xmath66@xmath1 .",
    "the dark regions in the lower row of figure  [ f : irradcloudb ] are reminiscent of the dark clouds in figure  [ f : g30.7 - 0.0 ] , however , for the wrong reason : the observed dark regions arise from back - illumination by the diffuse @xmath67 micron emission along the whole line of sight , while the dark ray - like regions in model b are a result of the complete uv - absorption of the single source available in the model .",
    "model sequence b does not seem representative of observed diffuse mir emission .",
    "the column density maps prominently exhibit filamentary structure over the whole domain .",
    "these filaments are shock fronts caused by the supersonic turbulence in the box .",
    "however , they are not reproduced in the flux density map . obviously ,",
    "because of their highly transient nature , the filaments contain only little mass , so that they do not represent a major obstacle to the star s uv - radiation .",
    "stars form in these models predominantly in the ( abundant ) intersections of filaments .",
    "the high shock compression leads to a close to instantaneous destabilization and fragmentation of these intersections , resulting in the formation of collapsed cores after less than one dynamical time in the simulations ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , cores form too soon in these simulations for the filaments to gather sufficient mass to be seen in mir diffuse emission .      before we can analyze the intensity distributions ( this section ) and the spatial structure (  [ ss : spatstruct ] ) , we need to `` remove '' the central source , which would otherwise dominate the analysis . to that purpose , we average the intensities azimuthally , centered on the flux density peak , and subtract the resulting profile from the frame",
    ". an alternative approach would be to just cut off the peak of the intensity corresponding to the central source .",
    "however , this leaves the imprint of the @xmath68-dilution of the radiation field , which is a direct effect of the central source and would confuse the structure analysis .",
    "the subtraction of the @xmath68-profile could be seen as a modified photometry algorithm for point sources irradiating a surrounding , optically thin diffuse medium .    the residual frame ( fig .",
    "[ f : cleanedfluxa ] ) still shows artifacts due to the central source , but the cloud structure is more pronounced than in the `` directly observed '' maps . comparing the residual maps to the column density maps ( top row of fig .",
    "[ f : irradclouda0][f : irradclouda3 ] ) demonstrates that the _ irradiation _  besides introducing additional structure via absorption ( dark regions )  _ generates more small - scale structure than observable in the column density map_. this is mostly an optical depth effect in the sense that already small increases in the optical depth ( shocks , filaments , smooth gradients in the density ) leads to additional absorption which then will be traced out by the re - emitted mir .",
    "this effect gets amplified if the `` obstacle '' uses up all the remaining uv photons in that ray , i.e. if the optical depth changes from @xmath69 to @xmath70 within that structure .",
    "the result is a bright region facing the central source , and a dark , shadowed region facing away from the source .    subtracting the central source in model b ( fig .",
    "[ f : cleanedfluxb ] ) is not as prone to produce artifacts in the residual flux density maps because the model is pretty much isotropic by construction .",
    "in contrast , since the cloud center of model a does not coincide with the uv - source , artifacts are unavoidable and easily recognized as darker circular regions .    residual flux density maps for the three lower density contrasts of model a. artifacts unfortunately are unavoidable . ]",
    "residual flux density maps for the three lower density contrasts of model b. since the model tends to be more isotropic by construction , artifacts of the subtraction carry less weight . ]      in the previous section we saw that a `` by eye''-comparison of the column density maps and the flux density maps reveals additional structure in the flux density",
    ". the next two sections will discuss under which conditions , and how strongly , the irradiation affects structure measures .",
    "we test the reliability of two traditional structure analysis tools , namely power spectra (  [ sss : powspec ] ) and structure functions (  [ sss : structfunc ] ) . since the flux density maps at higher densities are dominated by global irradiation effects , power spectra turn out to retrieve structure information less reliably than structure functions .",

    "the top panel shows the power spectrum for the original column density map , without any source or irradiation .",

    "obviously , the maps including the source are completely useless for structure analysis : the source dominates the whole spectrum .",
    "the slope ranges around @xmath71 ( not shown in the plot ) .",
    "a completely different picture is revealed when analyzing the residual maps : the resulting slopes approach the values of the column density maps . _",
    "the slightly flatter slopes indicate that irradiation introduces additional small - scale structure . _",
    "the artifacts introduced by the subtraction of the central source in model a2?0 are mirrored in the slight hump of the corresponding spectrum around @xmath72 .",
    "note that the power law exponents refer to power spectra , i.e. a kolmogorov law would be represented by @xmath73 .        to conclude for model sequence a , the power spectra reproduce the original scale distribution within the errors , which however are substantial , due to the circular averaging .",
    "the situation changes drastically for model series b ( fig .",
    "[ f : speca ] , right column ) , because the high - density cores lead to a strong power increase at small scales ( basically , they act as noise ) in the column density spectrum , which is why this spectrum is much flatter than expected for a turbulent power spectrum ( see also @xcite for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "note that the column densities in the cores range approximately 2 orders of magnitude above the mean column density ( fig .",
    "[ f : irradcloudb ] ) . since only a tiny fraction of a dense core can emit in the mir , these objects generally do not show up in the emission maps , and then only in extinction .",
    "again , the central source dominates the `` uncleaned '' spectrum .",
    "thus , in a sense , the mir maps of model b are more suitable for structure analysis than the original column density maps  granted that the major part of the map is unaffected by shadowing or self - extinction .",
    "structure functions are a more appropriate tool for analyzing the spatial distribution of an incomplete data set , since masking introduces artificial signals in the power spectra . only pixels with a measurable signal would contribute to structure functions of observational data .",
    "however , due to the irradiation and absorption effects the flux density map generally will not cover the whole cloud , as demonstrated in ",
    "[ ss : morphologies ] .",
    "thus , in order to compare the column density and flux density maps , we selected the former for column densities @xmath74 @xmath75 , which traces out the bulk of the cloud . applying the resulting mask to the flux density maps and determining the structure functions @xmath76 with lag @xmath11 and spatial coordinate @xmath49 , results in figure  [ f : structcheck ] .",

    "each panel shows the structure function of the original column density at @xmath74 ( thin line ) .",
    "the structure function for the corresponding flux density is plotted in thick line style .",
    "the numbers @xmath78 in each panel refer to the logarithmic slope of the structure function , @xmath79 taken over the first decade in @xmath11 .",
    "although a column density threshold of @xmath74 leads to most of the high - density gas in one contiguous object , there are a few isolated cloud fragments .",
    "since these cloud fragments are separated from the main body of the cloud , they tend to have the largest lags with respect to the main body , however , it turns out that their column densities are close to the mean column density within the main body , so that the structure functions show a drop at large lags .",
    "since figure  [ f : structcheck ] is somewhat messy to interpret , figure  [ f : structchecksum ] summarizes the degree to which the original column density structure information is retrieved from the flux - density maps    normalized difference between logarithmic slope of structure functions ( eq .  [ e : sfpower ] ) for column density ( @xmath80 ) and flux density ( @xmath81 ) , against the density contrast . for reasons of clarity ,",
    "the three coordinate directions are plotted in open symbols centered around their respective density contrast , i.e. a?x1 can be found left of @xmath82 , a?y1 at @xmath5 , and a?z1 right of @xmath5 . filled symbols denote the mean over the axis directions @xmath49 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "symbol types refer to the position of the source . ]    just looking at the filled symbols ( averages over the three coordinate directions ) one might get the impression that _ larger _ density contrasts lead to more accurately retrieved slopes .",
    "this is somewhat surprising .",
    "however , the scatter between the three coordinate directions is substantial and suggests to take a closer look at figures  [ f : irradclouda0][f : irradclouda3 ] again .    as will be shown in ",
    "[ ss : pahemissedge ] , the lowest density contrast allows a `` volume - rendering '' of the cloud : the medium is optically thin enough so that the exciting uv can light up the whole cloud , nearly acting as a uniform background field .",
    "if the source is within the cloud , though , it tends to over - represent the volume directly around it .",
    "thus , the best fit is given by a3y0 , where the source is located seemingly at the tip of a filament , farthest away from the bulk of the cloud .",
    "the effect of over - emphasizing close - by structures can be well observed even in a3y0 : above the source , a filament is traced out which does not show up clearly in the column density map . comparing this to a3x0",
    "we see that it suffers from `` neighborhood - illumination '' by the source : internal structure of the cloud thus is just smeared out : the flux - density slope is flatter than the column density slope ( fig .",
    "[ f : structcheck ] ) .",
    "a3z0 fares slightly better , although here the source over - emphasizes the ring - like structure close by , leading to a steeper slope .",
    "the center - position maps ( a2?0 ) all suffer from the source being located inside the cloud , while models a1?0 , where the source ( along the @xmath49-axis is located in the front , again tell a mixed story .",
    "for a1z0 , the source is located at the upper left end of the cloud , in a fairly diffuse environment and sufficiently far away from the bulk of the cloud in order not to affect the structure function ( third cross symbol for @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ f : structchecksum ] ) . for a1x0 and a1y0 ,",
    "the source is already too embedded .    moving on to the next density contrast , @xmath86 , again , a3y1 shows the lowest deviation , however , because of the shadowing effects in the cloud s left ( `` eastern '' ) part , the deviation is larger than for a3y0 . that a3x1 provides better fits than a2x1 and",
    "a1x1 is understandable again because of shadowing , although it is not directly clear why the match should be better than that for a3x0 . checking the corresponding panels",
    "a3x0 and a3x1 in figure  [ f : structcheck ] gives the answer : on the small scales , the structure functions agree , however , on large scales they differ . the better matches for a1z1 and a2z1 ( compared to a3z1 ) might be a consequence of the shadowed regions , which still show substructure : _ this substructure would enter the structure function on the small scales and provide the same information as structure in emission .",
    "_ thus  granted that we chose a small enough field for analysis  to some extent structure in absorption and emission can be used simultaneously for analysis .    at density contrasts @xmath87 and @xmath57 , matching between the overall shapes of structure functions for column and flux density deteriorates on the large scales ( fig .",
    "[ f : structcheck ] ) , as one would expect by looking at figures  [ f : irradclouda2 ] and [ f : irradclouda3 ] .",
    "however , there is still enough signal from irradiating small density variations for the structure functions to match on the small scales .",
    "again , given that we take a small enough region , the structure function can be reproduced .",
    "another limitation on the size of the region is given by the available dynamic range in the observed flux density maps .",
    "in the diffuse emission , it often turns out that the dynamic range is spanning @xmath5 , at most @xmath54 , decades , which limits the spatial scales available for analysis .    to summarize , structure functions seem to be a much more viable tool to investigate localized diffuse emission than power spectra .",
    "despite the fact that the irradiation sometimes modifies the underlying density information beyond the point of recognizability , the resulting structure functions still retrieve the salient scale information  given that the field investigated is small enough . because of the global irradiation effects , there is only little hope to retrieve the large - scale information accurately",
    ". the most promising way would be to identify small , `` uncontaminated '' regions and reconstruct the structure information from those .    the deviations ( fig .",
    "[ f : structchecksum ] ) are within the errors on the mean of the structure function ( see the analysis of power spectra ) .",
    "again , these stem from the circular averaging .",
    "the large deviations in fact point to a major problem when applying two - point correlators to data exhibiting anisotropic structures .",
    "for example , filaments will lead to different structure information along and perpendicular to their long axis , in turn leading to a mixing of the spectral information when averaging the directions .",
    "since the observed structure in the interstellar medium seems to be anisotropic to a large extent , the application of unmodified two - point correlators might raise questions .",
    "we will discuss this problem and possible remedies in a future paper .",

    "the overall positive correlation deteriorates for larger density contrasts .",
    "if the uv from the central source excites pah - emission in the rims of the surrounding molecular cloud , the emitted flux density could be used as an edge sensor or gradient indicator . to test this ,",
    "for each position in the simulation domain and the column density map we calculate the 3d radial density gradients @xmath98 and the two - dimensional column density gradients respectively @xmath99 the hatted quantities are bi - linear interpolations of the ( column ) density at the positions @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "the top row shows the original column density , followed by the 2d gradient @xmath112 and the projected 3d gradient @xmath113 .",
    "the two bottom rows give the flux density maps for models a2?1 and a2?2 , i.e. for increasing density contrast .",
    "the color scale is a measure of the location of the gradient , with blue closest to the observer , and red at the far end of the box . clearly , the gradients making up the map come from all possible locations along the line of sight . taking a2y1 , the l - shaped structure visible in extinction in the flux - density maps",
    "is traced out by a hazy bluish gradient - indicator : the corresponding density jump is close to the observer , which makes sense , since dense material between the source and the observer leads to the extinction .",
    "further right of the l - shape , the gradient map of a2y ? shows a red ( albeit dark ) region : weak gradients at the far side of the source .",
    "correspondingly , we see a bright irradiated region in the flux density map of a2y1 : the ( far away ) structures are irradiated by the central source .",
    "this is not seen anymore in a2y2 : the density has increased and leads to extinction of the far - away emission .",
    "similarly , the dark region to the lower left of the center in a2x1 corresponds to gradients close to the observer . in this case",
    "however , there is no clear blue signal in the 3d gradient map , which indicates that the dark region is caused by a combination of uv - shadowing and mir extinction of diffuse background . moving northwards of that direction , the source of emission is receding from the observer : again ,",
    "this information is lost at higher density contrast ( a2x2 ) , and thus the cloud structure is only incompletely `` sampled '' .",
    "interestingly , for a2z2 , the situation is nearly converse : the dark gradient - regions link up with strong emission signals ( to upper left of the center ) , while the extincted regions to the south are farther away from the observer .",
    "thus , those dark regions might again be caused by a combination of missing irradiation and extinction of diffuse background .",
    "the `` handle '' to the right is located at the far side of the central source .",
    "compared with this richness of structure , the 2d gradients come as sort of a big disappointment : they resemble the cloud structure only in the widest sense . beginning with a2y1 again ,",
    "the l - shape is recovered , but this is already all we can see .",
    ", the `` handle '' to the right of the central source is showing up slightly in @xmath112 .",
    "however , moving to the larger density contrast ( a2?2 ) , the situation changes slightly : the flux density maps look more `` rim''-like , more easily identified with the 2d gradient map .",
    "carrying this idea to the extreme , figure  [ f : gradienta2 ] shows the gradient maps and flux densities for a1?3 ( as fig .",
    "[ f : irradclouda3 ] shows , model a2?3 would be not exactly informative in this context ) .",
    "the 3d gradients now are hardly reproduced ( with the noticeable exception of the southern absorption rim in a1x3 ) .",
    "the 2d gradients however tend to trace now the absorption rims ( see e.g. a1y3 and a1z3 ) .",
    "_ thus , for lower density contrasts , or a more diffuse environment , the emission structures are intrinsically 3d , while for higher density regions , they tend to get more and more 2d ( although 3d effects are still not to be neglected ) . _",
    "the abundance of structure in mir diffuse emission as observed in e.g. the glimpse data seems to offer a perfect laboratory to study the dynamics of the dense ism .",
    "however , a large part of the observed structure could be irradiation effects due to pah emission .",
    "pahs are excited by uv photons from nearby stellar sources or the interstellar radiation field , and re - emit in the mir .",
    "because the respective cross sections differ by a factor of approximately @xmath48 , gas , which is optically thick in the uv , can still be optically thin in the ( emitted ) mir .",
    "thus , pah emission is often seen in filamentary structures , probably the `` rims '' of denser clouds .",
    "these irradiation effects might spoil the opportunity to study the ism gas structure , since this requires interpretation of the observed flux density in terms of volume or column density .",
    "motivated by a few examples taken from glimpse , we identified possible limitations of this interpretation .",
    "we quantified the reliability of flux - density maps of diffuse emission in the mir to reproduce the underlying ( column ) density information .",
    "we used two model sets , one corresponding to a ( more or less ) isolated `` molecular '' cloud , and the other imitating a region deep inside a molecular cloud , both irradiated by an o5 star .",
    "pahs absorb the uv and re - emit the energy in the mir , which then is integrated along the line - of - sight , including mir extinction . in the following , we will summarize how reliable flux density maps reproduce column density in our models , and how this affects the structure analysis , with possible applications to mir observations .",
    "if the medium is optically thin for the irradiating uv , then the mir emission maps could be used for a high - resolution study of the column density structure of the medium .",
    "@xcite supported this possibility for the nir , based on the observations of `` cloudshine '' by @xcite .",
    "since they were interested in the appearance of the diffuse emission , they used an isotropic radiation field mimicking a uv background , in contrast to our models that employ a point source for irradiating the surrounding medium . for higher - density environments such as molecular cloud in the vicinity of strong uv sources , interpreting mir emission as column density requires some caution : the transition from @xmath69 to @xmath115 can lead to strong signals in the mir flux density , but not necessarily paired with a corresponding signal in the column density : the maps bear no resemblance to the column density ( figs  [ f : irradclouda0][f : irradclouda3 ] and [ f : irradcloudb ] ) . in the extreme case ,",
    "pah - emission is only excited at the rims of clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , causing the impression of a highly filigree structure in the gas : irradiation introduces more small - scale structure than observable in the underlying column density maps .",
    "as soon as shadowing is obvious , the structure seen in emission will generally not represent column density",
    ". some of the observed shell - like structures could be just irradiation effects , and by themselves indicate that shadowing ( or `` rimming '' ) has set in ( figs .",
    "[ f : g30.7 - 0.0 ] , [ f : irradclouda1 ] and [ f : pahcuts ] ) .",
    "since our models do not include pah destruction around the star , we expect them to exhibit fewer shell - like structures than observed .",
    "pah cavities would lead to `` shells '' even if the cavities were not associated with e.g. wind - blown bubbles .",
    "power spectra are only partially useful for an analysis of diffuse emission structure .",
    "their well - known main drawback is that they tend to confuse the information about extent of a region and the separation of regions .",
    "furthermore , masking is always an issue in power spectra , since it tends to introduce a signal by itself .",
    "power spectra containing the central source are completely dominated by that ( fig .",
    "[ f : speca ] , left column ) , while spectra of residual maps are slightly flatter than the underlying column density distribution .",
    "this could be a projection effect and/or the result of additional small - scale structure traced out by irradiation .",
    "the spectral slope is pretty much insensitive to the density contrast within the error bars , which are significant . for collapsed regions ( fig .",
    "[ f : speca ] , right column ) , the column density spectrum flattens considerably because of the strong point source contribution . compared to that , the flux density spectra steepen because the point sources are not fully irradiated and thus do not show up ( except in extinction ) .",
    "structure functions seem to be a more viable tool to investigate localized diffuse emission . despite the fact that the irradiation may modify the underlying density information beyond the point of recognizability",
    ", the resulting structure functions still retrieve the salient scale information  given that the field investigated is small enough not to be contaminated by global irradiation effects .",
    "there is little hope to retrieve the _",
    "large - scale _ information accurately by applying a global structure measure such as power spectra .",
    "structure in extinction can be used as a continuation of structure seen in emission , although this raises the issue of an appropriate choice of background for the extincted region ( figs .",
    "[ f : g26.9 - 0.3 ] and [ f : irradclouda1 ] ) . the deviations ( fig .  [",
    "f : structchecksum ] ) are within the errors on the mean of the structure function .    since the overall structure in the ism tends to be anisotropic , applying two - point correlators seems at least questionable .",
    "averaging in @xmath116 or @xmath11 space leads to substantial errors on the mean , which themselves indicate that the underlying structure is anisotropic to a large extent .        since the conversion of uv to mir will occur predominantly at regions of large positive radial density gradients ( as long as there are photons left )",
    ", the flux density maps might offer the opportunity to gather information about the ( 3d ) density structure of the cloud . to test this",
    ", we compared the radial volume and column density gradients to the flux density maps . for lower density contrasts , the flux density maps tend to trace out the 3d structure of the cloud , and in fact they can be used as 3d gradient indicators . for higher density contrasts , they revert to an indicator of the column density gradients : the structures seemingly become two - dimensional .",
    "thus , more diffuse regions are intrinsically `` more 3d '' , while higher - density environments tend to be 2d .",
    "\\(1 ) if the volume density is low enough that the exciting uv can irradiate the whole cloud , one might question how long the line - of - sight actually is , and whether angular effects leading to scale - mixing in a structure analysis would play a role .",
    "\\(2 ) on the other hand , the volume density might be large so that the irradiating uv will be absorbed more or less directly `` at the rim '' ( if such a thing exists ) of the cloud . then , depending on the geometry of observer , irradiated medium and irradiation source , the observer might see predominantly 1d structures or 2d structures , implying projection effects in the spectral information .      depending on the diagnostics , mir flux density maps of diffuse emission from pahs excited by a nearby uv source can be used to extract information about the density structure of the underlying ( molecular ) cloud , though this statement needs some qualification .",
    "\\(3 ) as long as structure studies are restricted to areas small enough not to be contaminated by any large - scale effects , flux density and column density show similar structural properties .",
    "however , the application of unmodified two - point correlation functions introduces substantial errors on the mean due to the underlying anisotropy in the ism structure .",
    "employing mir diffuse emission to extract structure information about the underlying interstellar medium requires close attention to the environment .",
    "this study attempts to provide some guidelines to chose appropriate locations .",
    "bearing the limitations in mind , analyzing the ism structure with the help of the glimpse data will be a promising task .",

    "<S> the correlation strength between column density and `` observed '' flux density strongly depends on the absolute volume density range in the region . </S>",
    "<S> shadowing and irradiation effects may completely alter the appearance of an object . </S>",
    "<S> irradiation introduces additional small - scale structure and it can generate structures resembling shells around hii - regions in objects that do not possess any shell - like structures whatsoever . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , structural information about the underlying interstellar medium can be retrieved . in the more diffuse regime ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) </S>",
    "<S> , flux density maps may be used to trace the 3d density structure of the cloud via density gradients . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while caution definitely is in order , mid - infrared surveys such as glimpse will provide quantitative insight into the turbulent structure of the interstellar medium . </S>"
