    "the properties of molecular para - hydrogen ( p - h@xmath0  ) have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation over the years .",
    "one main research direction is related to the existence of a metallic phase at very large pressures@xcite . on the other hand , the bosonic nature and the very small mass of p - h@xmath0",
    "would naturally lead to the search for the existence of a superfluid phase .",
    "the strong h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction , however , causes the zero  pressure ground state of p - h@xmath0  to be a crystal at t=0 .",
    "the only possibility of finding p - h@xmath0  in a fluid phase at temperatures lower than 6k@xcite , where a superfluid transition is believed to occur , comes from geometry  constrained or strongly inhomogeneous systems .",
    "it has been shown by sinzingdre et al.@xcite using path ",
    "integral monte carlo methods that small p - h@xmath0  clusters with a number of molecules n@xmath113 preserve a liquid character , and show the signatures of superfluidity .",
    "recently levi and mazzarello@xcite proposed that the existence of such liquid clusters might depend on the difficulty for the system to go over the nucleation energy barrier in a time comparable to the lifetime of the clusters themselves .",
    "the determination of such energy barrier depends on the knowledge of a number of physical parameters , but in particular on the solid  liquid interface energy .",
    "it was recently shown that superfluid p - h@xmath0  could also be found in two dimensional layers deposited on substrates such as graphite .",
    "recent pimc calculations showed that at full coverage the density of a monolayer is too large for allowing the system to have a stable liquid phase .",
    "however , the presence of alkali impurities , that exert a very weak attraction on the hydrogen molecules , can stabilize a disordered phase reducing the strong p - h@xmath0  -p - h@xmath0  interaction@xcite .",
    "the same effect can be studied reducing the coverage and looking at two  dimensional p - h@xmath0  clusters at the surface .",
    "if the number of atoms in a single cluster is small enough ( n @xmath2 30 ) the stable configuration is a puddle of liquid@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of surface melting at the surface of a thick ( 5 to 7 monolayers ) layer of p - h@xmath0  was also studied by pimc techniques for temperatures @xmath3 3k@xcite .",
    "recent experiments performed by grebenev et al.@xcite on a ocs ",
    "p - h@xmath0  immersed in @xmath4he and mixed @xmath4he@xmath5he clusters clearly show that the hydrogen coating the molecule undergoes a transition at a temperature between 0.38k and 0.15k .",
    "this transition can be inferred by the change in the measured rotational spectrum , and therefore of the momentum of inertia , when the ocs ",
    "p - h@xmath0  complex is included in a pure @xmath4he cluster and when also @xmath5he is present .",
    "recent simulation work confirms the occurrence of this transition@xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "the simulation approach is the most effective in studying inhomogeneous phases . in this paper",
    "we extend to the study of p - h@xmath0  a technique that revealed extremely powerful in the description of inhomogeneous phases of @xmath4he with large numbers of particles : variational monte carlo calculations based on shadow wave functions ( swf)@xcite . the main property of swf is the capability of describing the crystalline and the disordered phase of a quantum system with the same translationally invariant form .",
    "it was therefore possible to study coexisting liquid ",
    "solid@xcite and liquid ",
    "vapor@xcite systems in @xmath4he as well as finite systems like @xmath4he clusters with and without impurities@xcite .",
    "this method , although not exact , gives quantitatively significant results , as for instance a realistic estimate of the interface energy of solid @xmath4he@xcite , in situations where other techniques , like path integral mc or diffusion mc , are harder to apply .",
    "some early calculations using swf for small p - h@xmath0  clusters ( n@xmath17 ) were performed by rama krishna and whaley@xcite .",
    "however , their form of the wave function used can not be immediately extended to bulk systems . in this paper",
    "we introduce a swf optimized and parametrized in a form directly usable in calculations where the parameters become functions of the _ local _ density of the system@xcite . with this wave function",
    ", we carried out a systematic study of the ground state properties of the bulk solid at densities up to 1.6 times the equilibrium density , and also to metastable bulk states below the equilibrium , beyond the limit of stability of the ordered phase .",
    "we also present results for an estimate of the vacancy formation energy in p - h@xmath0  as a function of the crystal density .",
    "molecular para - hydrogen is here described as a collection of @xmath6 point - like particles interacting via a two - body potential : @xmath7 the model potential we chose is the silvera - goldman ( sg)@xcite potential , which takes the form : @xmath8,\\ ] ] where , using @xmath9 . @xmath10\\;\\;{\\rm if } \\;\\ ; r <",

    "variational monte carlo calculations by norman et al.@xcite , using a bijl - jastrow - nosanow @xcite trial wave function , show that within this model the gs potential is in qualitative agreement with experiments in a wide range of densities ; other model interactions ( like the schaefer - watts potential@xcite or the buck et al .",
    "potential@xcite ) give better values around the equilibrium density , but become worse at higher pressure .",
    "we use as trial solution for the n - molecules hamiltonian at t=0k a shadow wave function@xcite , having the following general form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the molecular and auxiliary ( `` shadow '' ) degrees of freedom respectively . the kernel @xmath21 is written as the product of a jastrow  pair wavefunction involving the molecular degrees of freedom , times a term coupling molecular and shadow positions : @xmath26 \\prod_{i=1}^n \\exp\\left[-c\\left({\\bf r}_i-{\\bf s}_i\\right)^2\\right]\\ ] ] the shadow degrees of freedom are also correlated by @xmath27 , a jastrow product of the same form of the one used for the molecules .",

    "this wave function has been also taken as importance function for the diffusion monte carlo result that we computed at equilibrium density .",
    "all simulations have been performed for a cell of constant volume @xmath33 containing a number n of molecules such that @xmath34 , and imposing periodic boundary conditions in order to reduce finite ",
    "size effects .",
    "the simulations have been performed for two different crystal geometries : face - centered cubic ( fcc ) and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) .",
    "most of the results for the fcc crystal were obtained using n=108 molecules arranged on 3x3x3 elementary cubic cells of side @xmath35 . for simulations in the hcp phase we considered n=180 molecules in a cell made up of 5x3x3 elementary cells . in order to check the magnitude of finite size effects ( in particular for the vacancy formation energy ) simulations in the fcc crystal with n=256 ( 4x4x4 elementary cubic cells ) and n=500 ( 5x5x5 elementary cubic cells ) have also been performed .",
    "the molecule - molecule interaction is truncated at the edge of a sphere of radius equal to half of the side of the simulation box @xmath36 .",
    "the contribution from the potential energy outside the sphere is estimated by assuming that the pair correlation function is constant for distances larger than @xmath37 .",
    "the expectation values of the observables of interest have been computed by means of the variational monte carlo method . when using swf , the expectation value of a local operator @xmath38 is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the normalization of the wave function .",
    "this integral can be computed sampling the joint probability distribution for the molecular and shadow degrees of freedom : @xmath41 as we illustrated in previous work@xcite , the use of plain metropolis sampling considerably slows down the convergence of the results , especially when the crystal includes a vacancy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the probability for a particle to have a given displacement is conditional on the position of the corresponding shadow degrees of freedom , to which it is connected by harmonic - like terms .",
    "the structure of the system is therefore analogous to that of a collection of trimers , whose single components can have only limited relative moves . by using pseudoforces ( i.e. gradients of the function to be sampled ) in sampling the probability distribution @xmath42 , it is possible to move all the components of a trimer together .",
    "this was demonstrated to be a very powerful tool in the study of vacancies in solid @xmath4he , where it was shown that both relaxation of the density around the empty site and a mobility of the vacancy can be achieved@xcite .",
    "the use of gradients also improves the convergence in the disordered phase , and in metastable crystal phases , where the low density might give rise to local disordering of the system .",
    "the optimization of the variational parameters appearing in the swf was performed using the optimization program by c.j .",
    "umrigar and p. nightingale implementing a modified levemberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "the optimization of the parameters of the shadow  shadow correlation pseudopotential of eq .",
    "( 6 ) is particularly demanding from the computational point of view .",
    "in fact the local energy does not depend , configuration by configuration , on the value of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but on the statistical weight of the configuration @xmath45 only .",
    "the global computational cost of our swf , including the optimization stage , is comparable with that of a dmc simulation for the same system .",
    "however , once a satisfactory parameterization has been obtained , successive simulations have a cost which is at least one order of magnitude less than dmc .",
    "for this reason swf can be used for simulations including up to several thousands particles , as it was done for the study of the solid - liquid coexistence in @xmath4he .",
    "the optimized variational parameters in the swf each have a different density dependence .",
    "the density dependence is exploited in the local - density dependent version of the swf ( ld - swf)@xcite that is used for describing inhomogeneous systems , like the solid - vapor interface , with a single wavefunction . for such reason the optimization has to be carried out accurately in the region close to the equilibrium density ( which is experimentally found at @xmath46@xmath47@xcite ) , and lower .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 , connected to the width of the correlation hole of the molecules , and @xmath48 , giving the inverse of the mean square displacement between particles and shadows , show a weak dependence on the density .",
    "in particular the parameter @xmath48 is nearly constant and equal to 1@xmath49 throughout the density range considered .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 tends to saturate at high densities around a value @xmath50 , while at equilibrium density its value is @xmath51 . for densities lower than the equilibrium density",
    "the parameter @xmath14 shows some oscillations , contained within 5% of the value at equilibrium value .",
    "such oscillations might be due to the fact that the system and autocorrelations between configurations become very large , making the optimization difficult .",
    "for such reasons a reasonable choice in the ld - swf is to keep the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath48 constant at the value optimal at the equilibrium density .",
    "the remaining variational parameters @xmath44 and @xmath43 show a stronger density dependence .",
    "as already mentioned the energy at a given density has a much weaker dependence on the values of the shadow  shadow correlation parameters , due to the fact that @xmath52 does not enter in the estimate of the local energy . in fig .",
    "1 we show the results of the optimization . the errorbars indicate the range of values for which the variation in the computed variational energy is within two standard deviations from the optimal value .",
