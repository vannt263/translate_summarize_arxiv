    "the lhc is about to probe the physics of the tev scale .",
    "it holds great hope to discover new physics beyond the standard model and shed light on electroweak symmetry breaking and dark matter .",
    "the lhc detectors are designed to accurately detect several `` physics objects '' such as hard leptons , photons , jets , all of which are prompt , in addition to missing transverse energy and so on .",
    "searching for new physics typically involves looking for an excess of events with a particular combination of such physics objects after an appropriate set of cuts is employed .",
    "some of the conceptually simple searches include looking for an excess of events with leptons and/or jets and missing energy in models which include a wimp dark matter candidate , or resonance peaks in the kinematic distributions of leptons in models with a new @xmath0 gauge boson . the standard list of physics objects is also used for triggering .",
    "in addition to the standard set of physics objects , one can think of models which give rise to very non - standard objects .",
    "what is the value in these unconventional signals ?",
    "consider , for example , highly displaced vertices which were highlighted as potential signals for hidden valley models  @xcite .",
    "discovery of highly displaced vertices can teach us that a new neighbor sector exists alongside the standard model . studying the details of these events",
    "may teach us about the properties of the new sector .",
    "another example is that of a stopped stable gluino that decays out of time in the hadronic calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "such events can allow us to measure the lifetime of the gluino in split susy  @xcite and infer valuable knowledge about high energy parameters such a the susy breaking scale .",
    "even though such signals are not what the detectors were designed to discover , non - standard analyses have shown that they may be discovered with a reasonable efficiency .",
    "if discovered , these signals may give us new and complementary information about the new physics at the tev scale .",
    "in this paper we propose a new observable physics object at colliders  an anomalous underlying event . the underlying event ( ue )",
    "is the often overlooked part of every lhc event .",
    "it is defined as everything in the event which is not the outgoing hard jets or leptons .",
    "because of its omnipresence , the ue will be carefully studied and characterized for a variety of hard final states in terms of distributions of soft tracks and unclustered energy .",
    "characterizing the ue will be a valuable tool for tuning monte carlo event generators .",
    "anomalous _ underlying event is one which contains a distinctively uncharacteristic distribution of soft tracks and diffuse energy when compared to a characteristic ue with a similar hard final state . like any candidate signal",
    ", anomalous underlying events may and will be produced by sm backgrounds .",
    "discovery of new physics with anomalous ue s requires a statistically significant number of anomalous ue s when compared to the sm expectation .",
    "claiming such a discovery with confidence will require extracting the characteristics and of the typical ue and their variations from other lhc data .",
    "the signal and its search strategy are best explained in a concrete example .",
    "we will thus briefly explain the model and signal which are the focus of this paper and sketch the search strategy for this example .",
    "we will defer both details and general lessons to subsequent sections . in this paper",
    "we will consider a new physics scenario in which some new particles with a mass of several hundred gev are pair produced at the lhc .",
    "the new particles are charged under a new strong force and are thus confined to a single highly excited mesonic bound state . due to",
    "the `` quirky ''  @xcite nature of the new dynamics the excitation energy may easily exceed several hundreds of gev .",
    "after production , the excited bound state will emit soft radiation , and decay to the ground state , emitting many quanta .",
    "some of these quanta will be _ soft _ photons which are emitted in a particular angular distribution .",
    "the ground state will then annihilate into a _ hard _ final state , for example a hard @xmath1 and a hard photon .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath2+photon system reconstructs to the mass of the ground state meson ( again , at several hundred gev ) .",
    "all of the processes discussed above are prompt on collider time scales . a cartoon initial and final states of these events",
    "are depicted in figure  [ fig - cartoon ] .    .",
    "the two protons are incoming along the horizontal axis .",
    "the squirks are produced and oscillate along the dashed axis .",
    "the final state includes an antenna pattern of soft photons ( two cone like shapes aligned with the squirk production axis ) and a pair of hard annihilation products , @xmath3 in this case .",
    "the search strategy will first involve discovering a resonance in @xmath3 and then searching for signals of patterns of soft photons in the candidate signal events .",
    ", height=264 ]    the goal of the lhc search for this model would be to first establish that new physics is seen using standard hard physics objects emitted in the hard annihilation , and then to extract information about the nature of the new physics . in particular , detection of the unusual `` antenna pattern '' of soft photons in addition to the hard resonance will be a smoking gun signal of the strong dynamics and the presence of a bound state .",
    "what is a possible strategy to making these discoveries ? in this case the existence of new physics may be demonstrated by a standard hard search .",
    "however , the correlation of new physics events with anomalous underlying event may teach us about the nature of the new physics , and perhaps enhance the confidence in the original discovery .",
    "a rough sketch of a search is shown in figure  [ strategy ] and described below .        1 .",
    "* establish the existence of an excess of events from new physics*. + signal events will pass triggers with high efficiency due to the hard photon and lepton / jets from the annihilation .",
    "a promising search is to look for a peak in the @xmath2+photon invariant mass ( or rather transverse mass ) for leptonic @xmath2 decays  @xcite . due to the clean final state and the mass peak a signal - to - background ratio of order 1",
    "may be achieved but the results can easily be rescaled to other signal - to - background values . ] .",
    "* identification of signal and control samples*. + we would like to determine if the new physics discovered in step 1 is associated with an anomalous excess in soft particles .",
    "for example , a resonance in @xmath2+photon can be interpreted as a fundamental heavy @xmath4 which contributes no new _ soft _ physics .",
    "if the origin of the bsm excess were a @xmath4 , the underlying component of the signal events is strictly a long distance phenomena and would thus be similar to the underlying component in sm background events . in order to test",
    "whether a new anomalous component in the underlying event appears in correlation with the hard signal , we can compare the underlying part of events in the signal region to the underlying part of events that are known to be background dominated .",
    "+ one possible background dominated sample of events may be collected from neighboring bins in the kinematic distributions which were used to extract the signal , such as the regions immediately above or below the resonant peak ( see figure  [ strategy ] ) .",
    "undelying event studies have shown that the characteristics of ue s are largely independent of the hard @xmath5 in the event  @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the underlying event can thus be interpolated into the signal region reliably .",
    "+ in addition , since a large contribution to the underlying event at lhc is not directly related to the primary hard interaction , sample background underlying events may be collected from other channels with similar kinematics .",
    "for example , the ue in drell - yan @xmath6 with a @xmath7 that is similar to the discovered resonance , may be studied relatively easily and compared with the signal .",
    "* comparison of underlying events*. + signals of anomalous underlying events may be discovered either in the tracking or calorimetry of the lhc experiments .",
    "ue studies often use the number density and @xmath5 distributions of soft tracks in the central region ( or transverse regions for events with jets ) , e.g.  @xcite . in the case where the soft new physics is mostly in photons",
    ", the distribution of diffuse unclustered energy in the central em calorimeter may be more promising .",
    "in particular , a multipole decomposition of unclustered energy may be used to recognize antenna - like angular patterns in the underlying event .",
    "as we will discuss , even in the case of soft photons a tracking signal may be seen from photons that convert in the tracking system . in this work",
    "we will consider both tracking and calorimetry signals , and present a more detailed study of the later .",
    "a similar strategy may be applied to other lhc searches , particularly searches for di - lepton , di - jet , or di - photon resonances potentially teaching us that the new resonances are in fact de - excited bound states .",
    "an ue analysis of this type may also be applied to searches for large missing transverse energy . in this case",
    "an anomalous underlying component which is correlated with missing transverse energy may be a signal of light hidden valley particles that are decaying to soft sm particles and are `` faking '' the missing energy signal .",
    "in the example above the hard search alone gave a clear new physics signal and the ue study gave complementary information .",
    "one can also consider cases where a hard search is not likely to produce a significant excess above sm background ( e.g. in di - jet searches ) .",
    "as we will discuss briefly , in that case the anomalous underlying event may be used as a tool to reduce backgrounds and improve the confidence in the initial discovery .",
    "the method of discovering soft new physics will depend on the channel in which it is produced .",
    "in the example discussed above , where a large number of soft photons are emitted , discovering the anomalous ue with tracking may be difficult ( but perhaps possible ) and calorimetry may be more promising . in this work",
    "we will focus mostly on this case . on the other hand , in some new physics scenarios",
    "the new soft physics is hadronic ( e.g. in the case of the `` hadronic fireballs '' associated with colored quirks  @xcite ) .",
    "as we will discuss , in this case both tracking and calorimetry may be useful .",
    "having sketched the goals of this work we will consider the example above in more detail . in section  [ newphysics ]",
    "we will present a quirk model which may lead to a large number of soft photons in lhc events .",
    "we will briefly consider the dynamics and assumptions that lead to such events and parameterize some of the uncertainties . the model is directly motivated by folded supersymmetry , a recently proposed solution to the hierarchy problem using `` superpartners '' that are colored under a new gauge group instead of sm color . in section  [ detector",
    "] we will describe how soft particle , particularly photons , interact in the lhc detectors and how they may be discovered either by tracking or calorimetry . in section  4",
    "we focus on the calorimetric signal and present a simulation of a dedicated toy detector as well as simulations of the signal and background .",
    "we propose a possible observable based on a multipole decomposition of unclustered energy in the central calorimeter to discriminate signal and background events .",
    "we finally give two examples of analyses that may be done in searches for anomalous underlying events . in section  5",
    "we present a brief discussion and conclude .",
    "before presenting a particular model , we will briefly discuss the following question  what type of soft signals can potentially lead to an observable anomaly in the underlying event ? obviously , an observable signal of this type will only exist if some new dynamics is generating a large multiplicity of soft particles which are unclustered .",
    "additionally , an observable signal must dominate over the characteristic ue for the particular hard final state in question . because most of the standard ue comes from qcd ,",
    "most of the soft energy is emitted in the forward direction .",
    "in particular , distributions of energy and track multiplicity are expected to be flat in pseudorapidity ( though this will ultimately be measured ) .",
    "therefore new dynamics which emits soft particles into the central regions of the lhc detectors are more likely to be observable due to the lower background there .",
    "finally , emission of soft particles in a particular angular pattern can help distinguishing signal from background .",
    "the new physics model we will now discuss will have all of these features .",
    "we will now present a brief review of quirks , a new type of particle which exhibit new and interesting dynamics .",
    "these dynamics have been known for a while  @xcite , and have received recent attention in the context of the lhc as well as their name in  @xcite .",
    "more recent discusions are in  @xcite .",
    "similar dynamics may also be present in hidden valley scenarios  @xcite .    though quirky dynamics may be exotic",
    ", it can arise from a seemingly mundane extension of the sm .",
    "consider a model with a new strong force , qcd. for concreteness we will take qcd to be an asymptotically free su(n ) gauge force with a qcd scale @xmath8 of order a few gev .",
    "we introduce some matter fields , collectively called @xmath9 , which are charged under the new force and also under the standard model interactions .",
    "as opposed to regular qcd in which there are quarks , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , whose masses are bellow the qcd scale , we will consider a case where all matter charged under qcd is more massive than  @xmath8 @xmath12 where even a little hierarchy between these two scales will be sufficient .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , the particles that are charged under the new force have been called `` quirks ''  @xcite ( or squirks , depending on their spin ) for reasons that will become clear presently . in particular we will consider two types of quirks ",
    "_ uncolored quirks _ , which in addition to being charged under qcd carry only electroweak quantum numbers , and",
    "_ colored quirks _ which also carry sm color .",
    "beyond these two categories one can make various choices , such as the spin of the particles , that will matter only in the details .",
    "the examples we will consider are motivated by a specific model , folded supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "starting with the uncolored case , consider the scalar squirk @xmath13 with the following quantum numbers    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - eff ]    the variable we used above does not single out any particular multi - pole .",
    "other possible observables that focus on @xmath14 might be used , though we did not find that these did much better in our particular case .",
    "given the efficiencies above , one may analyze the data by several approaches depending on the efficiency and confidence level of the original hard search and on the amount of energy emitted in soft radiation with each new physics event .",
    "we will begin with a scenario that is quite likely in our case of uncolored squirks annihilating to @xmath3 .",
    "this hard final state is quite distinct and the signal to background ratio may well be of order one , as demonstrated in  @xcite . however , even when new physics is discovered we would like to extract as much information about it as possible .",
    "in other words , would like to test whether the discovered signal is a `` normal '' resonance in @xmath3 or perhaps a quirky bound state .",
    "we would like to test whether the new signal is correlated with anomalous underlying events .    to test this hypothesis",
    "we may exploit the fact that the underlying event is believed to be quite universal , particularly for similar final states .",
    "following the strategy outlined in section  [ intro ] we can thus collect a `` control '' data set of standard underlying events by considering similar final states in different kinematic regions , or completely different final states ( e.g. di - muon events ) .",
    "in fact , the characteristic properties of underlying events , such as charged particle density and @xmath5 distributions have been shown to be independent of @xmath7 in jet events as well as drell - yan ( beyond a certain energy )  @xcite .",
    "this implies that one can collect a sizable pool of standard underlying events which are not `` contaminated '' by contributions from new physics such as quirks .",
    "this large control sample can then be compared with the underlying events in the signal region .",
    "due to the large number of events , such an analysis may be effective in discovering quirky dynamics even under the more pessimistic assumption of 10% of the excitation energy being released in photons .",
    "given enough statistics the the difference between the 10% and bg distributions of figure  [ figsinalpha ] may be established .    to see this lets do a gedanken - analysis with 100 fb@xmath15 of data and a simple two - bin chi - squared test . in line with the analysis of  @xcite we will assume the quirk production cross section is of order 10 fb and the branching ratio to leptons",
    "times efficiency for the search is of order 0.1 , giving roughly 100 signal events .",
    "these numbers are consistent with a squirk mass of 500 gev , which was used in our simulations . with these efficiencies",
    "the signal to background ratio is of order 1 , providing clear evidence for new physics well beyond 5 sigma .",
    "thus the `` signal sample '' consists of 200 events , a half of which are true signal .",
    "the multipole variable @xmath16 in signal and background events follows the distributions shown in figure  [ figsinalpha ] ( of course , a more detailed analysis of the ue background and the detector may yield different results ) .",
    "as a simple example consider just two bins of @xmath16 bellow and above 0.7 .",
    "our simulation showed that the fractions of events with @xmath17 are 0.02 and 0.17 for background and signal events ( 10% of energy in photons ) respectively . on average ,",
    "about 20 of the 200 events will fall in the @xmath17 bin .",
    "this may be compared with a large control sample consisting of pure background underlying events . in a control sample of 3000 events",
    "only 60 events will fall in the @xmath17 bin on average . if the measured frequencies landed close to these averages a chi - squared test of independence gives a very `` bad fit '' of @xmath18 for a single degree of freedom .",
    "such a measurement would support that the two samples are drawn from two different distributions with a high confidence level .",
    "the ability to consider larger control samples is important to stabilize such a result against statistical fluctuations .",
    "for example , consider the case in which we are unlucky and the actual measured numbers of events in the @xmath17 bin fluctuate by 2 sigma down and up for both the signal and the control samples respectively . even in this unfavorable case the measured signal and",
    "control samples are statistically independent with @xmath19 for a single degree of freedom .",
    "this demonstrates that in order to carry out this program and large control sample of standard model underlying events should be collected and studied .",
    "we now consider a different situation ( which is not necessarily applicable in our case of uncolored squirks going to @xmath3 )",
    ". lets assume that an order one fraction of the excitation energy ( of order 0.5 tev ) is released in photons .",
    "however , we can also suppose that the confidence level of discovery in the standard hard analysis is poor , bellow 3 sigma . in this case we can exploit the distinct soft signal ( as seen in the 100% curve of figure  [ figsinalpha ] ) to improve the confidence level of discovering new physics .",
    "instead of searching for the hard final state @xmath20 , we should perhaps search for @xmath20+an anomalous underlying event .",
    "such an analysis may fit well with the case of colored quirks in which the amount of soft energy is perhaps larger ( since the competition with invisible glueballs is less of an issue ) and the hard final state may be in jets , which suffers from a larger background than the distinct @xmath3 .",
    "as we pointed out earlier the systematics of soft hadrons may be somewhat different than those of and should be considered separately .",
    "to demonstrate this lets again assume the efficiencies derived from figure  [ figsinalpha ] .",
    "we can now use the atypical shape of the underlying event as a discriminant between signal and background . in imposing a cut of @xmath17",
    "the background will be efficiently reduced to 2% of that in the original search whereas the signal is reduced by @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , in the more optimistic scenario of 100% of the energy emitted in photons , the original s/@xmath22 may be improved by a factor of @xmath23 . in this case , our underlying event analysis may potentially take a 1 - 2 sigma bump into a discovery beyond 5  sigma ! the less optimistic case of 10% of the energy in photons",
    "the improvement factor is a more modest 1.2 .",
    "in this work we have focused on a specific example of new physics , uncolored squirks , which lead to a diffuse soft signal at the lhc . as we mentioned throughout the paper colored quirks",
    "may also be promising candidates for generating soft signals in the spirit discussed here .",
    "are there any other cases ? the hidden valley scenario  @xcite has been proposed recently as an interesting possibility for novel lhc signals .",
    "the general idea involves the production of new particles which are charged under a new strong force .",
    "these particles will shower and hadronize according to the strong dynamics of the new sector .",
    "such a showering process will typically distribute the high energy of the produced particles into many soft valley hadrons , some of which will decay to soft sm jets , leptons or photons .",
    "one promising way to produce a diffuse soft signal in the spirit of the ones we are studying is to consider an unparticle scenario  @xcite in which the conformal symmetry in the hidden sector is broken at some low scale .",
    "the strong conformal dynamics will produce very broad `` jets '' of valley particles ( the part of the spectrum just above the gap , which is likely to contain resonances ) and thus broad distributions of soft and diffuse sm decay products .",
    "indeed , `` multi - unparticle '' production may be enhanced in these scenarios  @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting possibility is that the hidden sector couples to the sm through the `` higgs portal ''  @xcite .",
    "for example , the lagrangian may contain an operator @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an operator in the new strong sector .",
    "if the hidden sector indeed contains strong and nearly conformal dynamics , the most likely decay channel of the higgs may be to broad and soft `` jets '' of valley hadrons .",
    "the decay of the light valley particles to standard model states will produce a soft modification to underlying events at the lhc",
    ". a possible search would be for a single boosted z plus an anomalous underlying event from the higgs decay .",
    "the multiploe expansion of soft energy in this case would presumably exhibit a peak at @xmath26 with subleading peaks at higher odd @xmath27 s .",
    "another interesting possibility which has been proposed recently is that the higgs itself is part of the unparticle sector  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the higgs is part of a strongly coupled sector which also contains very light degrees of freedom .",
    "these light degrees of freedom may couple back to the standard model , e.g. by integrating out the heavy higgs .",
    "it is thus plausible that as a higgs is produced a shower of light degrees of freedom is emitted which consequently decay back to soft sm particles .",
    "such an event will contain the hard decay products of a higgs in addition to a modified underlying event . in these scenarios",
    ", the strategies outlined in this work may ultimately shed new light on the nature of the higgs .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we have proposed a new signal of new physics at the lhc .",
    "searches for new and heavy physics has rightfully focused on hard physics object .",
    "we have demonstrated that new physics may also be discovered in the soft , or underlying component of lhc events .",
    "discovery of an anomalous underlying event may be a unique way to discover the non - perturbative nature of new physics that is otherwise unattainable .",
    "we demonstrated our strategy in a simple model of quirks ( or squirks ) which is inspired by folded supersymmetry , a model for addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem .",
    "we have discussed some of the strategies to search for anomalous underlying events , both in the tracking and the calorimetry of the lhc experiments .",
    "a general lesson to be drawn from this work is that underlying event studies should accompany some of the standard searches of new physics .",
    "such an underlying event study may either enhance the confidence of discovering new physics , or teach us new information about new physics .",
    "the hard searches which may benefit from an accompanying ue analysis include searches for heavy resonances , ( di - boson , di - lepton or di - jet ) as well as searches involving missing transverse energy .",

    "this work was supported in part by doe grant de - ac02 - 76sf00515 .",
    "to generate the photon spectrum in our simulation we modeled the radiative decay of squirkonium by the classical radiation of accelerating charges .",
    "the charged squirkonium is modeled as two particles of equal masses and of charges @xmath28 and @xmath29 with a constant force acting between them .",
    "the classical equation of motion is @xmath30 in the center of mass frame .",
    "since the squirks are produced semi relativistically we use relativistic momentum @xmath31 . assuming the motion is along the @xmath32 direction the solution is a periodic trajectory with a period of @xmath33 with the trajectory for @xmath34 described by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total energy of the system , initially set to @xmath7 .",
    "the classical photon spectrum may be evaluated by fourier decomposing the retarded field far away from the oscillating charges . because of the periodic nature of the motion the field decomposes into a discrete fourier series with frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 . following  @xcite ,",
    "the power radiated per solid angle in the @xmath39th frequency mode is @xmath40 where the @xmath41 sum is over the two charges , @xmath42 is the charge of the particle @xmath41 and @xmath43 is the instantaneous distance of a far away point from that particle . assuming the linear motion of equation ( [ orbit ] ) , the fourier integral over the path of the particle may easily be done numerically .    to simulate the radiative decay of a quirkonium system produced with a center of mass energy of @xmath7 we simply generate a photon according to the spectrum of equation  ( [ spectrum ] ) using a trajectory of that energy .",
    "we then subtract the photon s energy from the oscillating system and generate the next photon with the reduced energy , and so on . as discussed in section  2",
    ", one should assume some of the energy is radiated in the form of ( hidden ) glueballs .",
    "for example , as a benchmark we also consider the case where only 10% of the energy is radiated in photons . to generate these events",
    "we follow the same procedure , but only considering every tenth photon as visible , throwing 90% of the photons away .",

    "<S> though it is often used for qcd and monte carlo studies , here we propose the incorporation of an underlying event analysis in some searches for new physics . </S>",
    "<S> an excess of anomalous underlying events may be a smoking - gun signal for particular new physics scenarios such as `` quirks '' or `` hidden valleys '' in which large amounts of energy may be emitted by a large multiplicity of soft particles . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible search strategies for such soft diffuse signals in the tracking system and calorimetry of the lhc experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed study of the calorimetric signal in a concrete example , a simple quirk model motivated by folded supersymmetry . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the production and radiative decay of highly excited quirk bound states leads to an `` antenna pattern '' of soft unclustered energy . using a dedicated simulation of a toy detector and a `` cmb - like '' multipole analysis we compare the signal to the expected backgrounds .     </S>",
