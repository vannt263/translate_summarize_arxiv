    "it is by now well established that baryonic matter represents only about @xmath1 of the total matter density of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the majority is in the form of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm )",
    ". since galaxies form through the accretion of baryonic material onto dynamically dominant dm structures ( halos ) , it would be reasonable to assume that the baryon mass fraction of present day galaxies approximately equals the cosmic value ( @xmath2 ) . despite this expectation , observations point to the fact that galaxies are not able to retain their cosmic `` fair share '' of baryons , and that the resulting baryon deficit depends strongly on the mass of their host halo .",
    "the first line of evidence is provided by observational estimates of the abundance of galaxies as a function of their total stellar mass , a distribution referred to as the galactic stellar mass function ( smf ) .",
    "thanks to the advent of wide area optical surveys with multiband photometric and spectroscopic information , such as the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the smf has been measured over the mass range @xmath3 , using statistical samples of tens of thousands of galaxies and a variety of stellar mass estimation techniques ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to name a few ) .",
    "the smf displays an exponential cutoff at masses @xmath4 and an approximate power - law behavior at low masses ( @xmath5 ) , with a `` shallow '' exponent of @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", the halo mass function ( hmf ) predicted in the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model , follows a much `` steeper '' power - law ( @xmath7 ) over the mass range of interest .",
    "this observation alone excludes the possibility that the stellar mass of a galaxy is simply a fixed fraction of the host halo mass .",
    "one can furthermore statistically derive an average relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy ( @xmath8 ) and the mass of its host halo ( @xmath9 ) , through the technique of abundance matching ( see  [ sec : am ] for details ) .",
    "@xmath8 - @xmath9 relations based on abundance matching ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the `` stellar conversion efficiency '' , @xmath10 , never exceeds 25 - 30% . furthermore , @xmath11 peaks for milky way - sized galaxies ( @xmath12 ) , and declines rapidly on either side of the peak ( e.g. figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the second line of evidence comes from direct halo mass measurements , obtained through weak lensing or kinematics studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite used stacked weak lensing measurements to estimate the average host halo mass of galaxies in different stellar mass bins , and found that @xmath11 never exceeds @xmath13% .",
    "direct halo mass measurements can circumvent a number of assumptions inherent in the application of abundance matching , but such techniques can presently only be applied to a restricted range of stellar mass ( @xmath14 ) , and are affected by their own set of systematics .",
    "stellar mass is not always the dominant baryonic component in a galaxy . in fact , the hi  to  stellar mass ratio ( `` hi fraction '' ; @xmath15 ) tends to increase with decreasing stellar mass , and hi often dominates the baryonic content of low - mass galaxies .",
    "the transition from stellar - mass  dominated to hi ",
    "dominated systems takes place at @xmath16 for hi - selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .",
    "[ fig : gsmr ] in this work ) , or at @xmath17 for optically - selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , it is presently not clear what is the behavior of the `` baryon retention fraction '' @xmath18 in low - mass galaxies , when both stars and cold gas are taken into account . in particular",
    "it is not well understood whether the very low average value of @xmath11 inferred for low - mass halos is a result of poor retention of baryonic material , of the low efficiency of gas - to - stars conversion , or of a combination of both .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that the increasing gas fraction in low - mass galaxies should approximately offset the decreasing stellar - to - halo mass ratio , and result in a roughly constant @xmath19% .",
    "this conclusion was based on an indirect estimate of the cold gas content of galaxies , based on the average @xmath20 relation observed in a set of samples in the literature",
    ". an early work by @xcite , based on the same indirect method , also reached a qualitatively similar conclusion .",
    "@xcite found an approximately constant @xmath21 at the low - mass end using a different indirect method , which involves the comparison of the stellar and hi mass distributions of two different galaxy samples .",
    "these results would imply that low - mass galaxies are relatively efficient at retaining baryonic mass , but very inefficient in converting their gas into stars .",
    "this conclusion , however , would require a `` steep '' hi mass function ( himf ) in the local universe , in contrast to what is measured @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent work of @xcite , also based on using the average @xmath20 relations for blue and red galaxies separately , found no signs for a flat @xmath21 at low masses .    in this article",
    "we _ directly _ measure the abundance of galaxies as a function of their `` baryonic mass '' ( throughout this article the term baryonic refers to the combined stellar and atomic gas components of galaxies , and baryonic mass is calculated as @xmath22 , where the 1.4 factor accounts for the presence of helium ) .",
    "we use optical data from the seventh data release of the sdss ( sdss dr7 ) to estimate stellar masses , and hi - line flux measurements from the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey to measure atomic gas masses .",
    "the resulting distribution , referred to hereafter as the baryon mass function ( bmf ) of galaxies , can be used in abundance matching to derive a robust @xmath21 - @xmath9 relation . in order to investigate sample selection effects , we employ both an hi - selected and an optically - selected sample drawn from the _ same _ volume to derive the mass distributions for the stellar , atomic hydrogen and baryonic components .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : data ] , we introduce the datasets used to measure the stellar , hi and baryon mass distributions .",
    "we describe the methodology used to measure atomic hydrogen masses and we estimate stellar masses for our galaxy samples . in section [ sec : bmf ] , we present our measurements of the smf , himf & bmf from both the hi - selected and the optically - selected samples , and compare them against one another as well as against other published results . in section [ sec : biases ] we consider the impact of possible systematics on our measurements , such as stellar mass estimation method , distance uncertainties and the exclusion of some baryonic components ( e.g. molecular gas ) in the calculation of the bmf . in section",

    ", we use a hubble constant of @xmath23 .",
    "we select galaxies from the current data release of the alfalfa survey , which covers 40% of the planned final survey area ( `` @xmath24.40 '' catalog ; @xcite ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to two rectangular areas of the `` spring '' coverage of @xmath24.40  ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 & @xmath27 ) , which encompass the virgo cluster as well as the supergalactic plane at low velocities .",
    "we restrict ourselves to galaxies with @xmath28 15000 km s@xmath29  ( @xmath30 ) , in order to avoid the strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) present at frequencies that correspond to @xmath31 km s@xmath29 .",
    "we discard the nearest extragalactic sources with @xmath32 mpc , because they can carry extreme fractional uncertainties on their distances ( see  [ sec : derived ] for details on the distance assignment method ) .",
    "we furthermore select only hi sources designated as `` code 1 '' in @xmath24.40 , i.e. extragalactic sources detected at high significance ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition , we exclude sources with integrated fluxes below the 50% completeness limit of the alfalfa survey ( see @xcite , section 6 for the derivation of the alfalfa completeness limits ) .",
    "the above requirements are satisfied by 7618 galaxies .",
    "we remove from our sample 204 @xmath24.40  sources which are not crossmatched with an optical source in sdss , as well as 208 additional sources which have been flagged as having problematic sdss photometry ( crossmatch code `` p '' in @xmath24.40 , for details see section 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this quality cut on the sdss photometry introduces some bias against faint , low surface brightness galaxies of irregular morphology ; such sources are often `` shredded '' ( i.e. assigned multiple photometric objects ) by the sdss magnitude extraction process , and are usually assigned a `` p '' ( `` photometry suspect '' ) crossmatch code in @xmath24.40 .",
    "lastly , 11 additional objects were discarded , in cases where the stellar mass computation method described in  [ sec : derived ] failed to produce physically plausible results .",
    "our final sample thus consists of 7195 extragalactic objects , detected over @xmath342000 deg@xmath35 of high galactic latitude sky and out to @xmath36 mpc .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : coneplot ] displays the spatial distribution of our hi - selected galaxies , and puts in evidence the complex large scale structure in the survey volume .",
    "note that all objects in our hi - selected sample have 21 cm redshifts and line fluxes as well as multi - band optical photometry , and hence estimates of both their stellar and atomic hydrogen masses .",
    "we draw an optically - selected sample from the sdss dr7 @xcite spectroscopic database , in the same volume used to define our hi - selected sample . specifically , we select galaxies that lie within the same sky area ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 & @xmath27 ) and satisfy the same velocity and distance restrictions ( @xmath37 15000 km s@xmath29 , @xmath38 mpc ) .",
    "cmb velocities for our optically - selected galaxies are calculated based on their sdss spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies in sdss ( ` specclass = 2 ` ) that also have an apparent petrosian magnitude brighter than 17.5 in the @xmath40-band ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this initial cut results in 22707 galaxies .",
    "due to their large number , it is not practical to inspect all galaxies individually for the quality of their sdss photometry / spectroscopy . as a result",
    ", we expect a fraction of our sources to have issues with their sdss photometry , most often related to `` shredding '' ( i.e. assignment of multiple photometric objects to a single galaxy ) .",
    "this issue affects mostly extended sources with structure in their light distribution , such as low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies with irregular morphology . in such cases",
    ", the sdss magnitude will underestimate the true flux of the galaxy , which in turn will result in an underestimate of its stellar mass . a second issue related to shredding ,",
    "is that bright star forming knots in the disks of nearby spiral galaxies can sometimes be cataloged as separate spectroscopic objects , and hence interpreted as low - mass satellites of the main spiral .",
    "we find that applying a color cut on our sample , @xmath42 , removes a fair fraction of these unwanted cases . on the other hand , cuts based on the quality of the sdss spectrum ( such as cuts on ` zconf ` , ` zstatus ` or ` zwarning ` ) are ineffective , since they exclude mostly legitimate faint or lsb dwarf galaxies with noisy spectra .",
    "lastly , we exclude objects for which the stellar mass computation described in  [ sec : derived ] failed to produce physically plausible results .    our final optically - selected sample consists of 22587 galaxies , occupying the same volume as our hi - selected sample .",
    "we crossmatch the optical sample with the full @xmath24.40  catalog ( including code 1 & 2 sources ) , and find 7551 hi source counterparts .",
    "the crossmatch rate is thus approximately @xmath43 , as reported in @xcite .",
    "note that alfalfa non - detected galaxies are not necessarily hi - poor objects ; due to the low emissivity of atomic hydrogen in the 21 cm line , even moderately gas - rich galaxies in the outer portion of the survey volume can be missed by alfalfa .",
    "this point is illustrated by the lower panel of figure [ fig : coneplot ] , which compares the spatial distribution of galaxies in the hi - selected and optically - selected samples .",
    "note that all optically - selected galaxies have multiband optical photometry as well as optical redshifts , and hence an estimate of their stellar mass .",

    "b _ , the hi - selected sample is strongly biased against the red galaxy population and as a result it is skewed towards lower luminosity and stellar mass systems .",
    "conversely , the fractional contribution of bright and massive galaxies ( @xmath45 ) is larger for the optically - selected sample ( panels _ a _ and _ c _ ) . ]",
    "we calculate hi masses from the measured 21 cm integrated flux reported in @xmath24.40 . assuming optically thin emission    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the hi mass in units of the solar mass ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 is the integrated flux in jy@xmath50km@xmath51s@xmath29  and @xmath52 is the distance in mpc . distances in this article are calculated according to the method used in @xmath24.40  @xcite : nearby galaxies ( @xmath53 km s@xmath29 ) are assigned distances through the use of a peculiar velocity flow model developed by @xcite , while for more distant galaxies simple hubble distances are used ( @xmath54 , with @xmath55 km@xmath51s@xmath29mpc@xmath29 ) .",
    "moreover , group and cluster membership information is taken into account when available , as well as primary distance measurements published in the literature .",
    "we would like to point out that most of the galaxies in our optically - selected sample are not included in @xmath24.40 , and hence lack the systematic group assignments and primary distance information contained in the catalog .",
    "nevertheless , optically - selected galaxies that lie within the sky area and redshift range of the virgo cluster are placed collectively at the virgo distance ( @xmath56 mpc ) , in order to minimize the effects of peculiar motions on the inferred distances of galaxies in the region .",
    "we would also like to note that the distance assignment method can have a large impact on the determination of mass functions , especially at the low - mass end .",
    "we illustrate this issue in  [ sec : dist_unc ] , where we consider the effect on the himf of using uniformly hubble distances for all galaxies .",
    "we compute stellar masses for our galaxies based on fitting all 5 sdss photometric bands ( @xmath57 ) , with model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the full details of the method can be found in @xcite , but here we summarize the main points : a library of model seds are generated , using the @xcite stellar population synthesis code and assuming a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "models with an extensive range of internal extinction , metallicity and star formation histories are considered .",
    "in particular , star formation history templates include both an exponentially declining component as well as random starburst episodes .",
    "the final physical properties ( e.g. stellar mass , star formation rate , internal extinction etc . ) are computed as the average of all model values , where each model is weighted according to its fit likelihood .",
    "in addition to mean values , `` @xmath58 '' uncertainties of the physical properties can also be derived , as one quarter of the 2.5 - 97.5 percentile range of model values .",
    "the median @xmath58 uncertainty in @xmath59 is 0.086 dex , or about 22% ( excluding uncertainties on the distance ) .",
    "it is important to note that stellar mass estimates of the same galaxy obtained with different methods can have systematic offsets of up to factors of a few . in ",
    "[ sec : stellar_est ] we address issues related to stellar mass estimation , and consider alternative methods for calculating stellar masses @xcite .    figure [ fig : histogram ] compares the distributions of @xmath60-band absolute magnitude ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath44 color ( both corrected for milky way extinction ) , stellar mass ( @xmath8 ) and hi mass ( @xmath47 ) for the hi - selected and optically - selected samples .",
    "the most notable difference is in the @xmath44 color distribution , where the hi - selected sample shows a strong bias against the red galaxy population ( see also @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the optically - selected sample contains a larger proportion of high luminosity and stellar mass systems compared to the hi - selected sample .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath47 distribution of the two samples is very similar , but remember that only those optically - selected galaxies that are detected in alfalfa are included in the histogram .",
    "stellar masses for all galaxies , and hi masses for all alfalfa - detected galaxies are calculated as described in ",
    "[ sec : derived ] . for the @xmath3415000 galaxies in the optically - selected sample that lack an alfalfa detection , we assign a lower and an upper limit on their atomic hydrogen content ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the lower limit is simply @xmath63 , which corresponds to an hi - devoid galaxy .",
    "the upper limit is calculated by assuming that the hi flux of the non - detected galaxy lies just below the alfalfa `` detection limit '' , as defined by the 25% completeness limit of the @xmath24.40  catalog when both code 1 & 2 sources are considered .",
    "more precisely    @xmath64    where @xmath52 is the galaxy distance in mpc determined by its sdss optical redshift , and @xmath65 is the flux level at which the completeness of the @xmath24.40  catalog falls to 25% , in jy km s@xmath29 .",

    "we calculate cumulative mass functions in logarithmic mass bins for all three components ( i.e. stellar mass , atomic hydrogen mass , baryonic mass ) , separately for the hi - selected and optically - selected samples . since neither sample is volume - limited , mass functions have to take into account the sample selection criteria as well as the large - scale structure in the survey volume .",
    "hi selection is based on a combination of galactic hi integrated flux , @xmath49 , and profile width , @xmath67 ( see  [ sec : hi_selected ] & discussion in section 6 of @xcite ) ; as a result , galaxies of different hi masses and linewidths are detected out to different distances .",
    "similarly , our optically - selected sample is a flux - limited sample , which results in galaxies with different @xmath40-band absolute magnitudes being detected in different volumes . as a result ,",
    "mass distributions are calculated by summing up the number of detections in a given mass bin ( see fig .",

    "this is a non - parametric , maximum - likelihood method , which reduces to the standard @xmath73 method @xcite when applied to a spatially homogeneous galactic sample .",

    "inferred galactic properties depend not only on the particular type of data employed by each method ( e.g. spectroscopy vs. broadband photometry or optical vs. near - infrared photometry ) , but also by differences in the way in which the model stellar populations are constructed .",

    "stellar , hi and baryonic masses are distance - dependent quantities and hence their statistical distributions are affected by distance uncertainties .",
    "this is particularly true for the low - mass end of the distributions , which is determined by the properties of nearby galaxies ; neglecting the peculiar velocity of some of these objects can cause fractional distance and mass errors of order @xmath89 , especially in a volume with complex large - scale structure such as the one surveyed by alfalfa ( see fig .

    "the residuals are then attributed to random thermal motions , which are estimated to have a magnitude of @xmath92 km s@xmath29 . in addition , distances reported in the @xmath24.40  catalog take into account known group and cluster membership as well as primary distance information published in the literature .",
    "this latter information is not available for the majority of the galaxies in our optically - selected sample ( which are not included in @xmath24.40 ) , and we only make an attempt to assign all probable virgo members to the virgo cluster distance ( @xmath93 ) .    here",

    "recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have challenged this statement , by managing to reproduce `` realistic '' galaxies whose properties satisfy a number of observational constraints . for example , the high - resolution eris simulation @xcite has managed to produce a milky - way type object with values of @xmath11 in agreement with those that we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : am2 ] .",
    "more recently , @xcite has managed to reproduce a population of @xmath1491000 simulated galaxies with low stellar - to - halo mass ratios ( @xmath150 at @xmath151 ) , in accordance to observations .",
    "notice , however , that this simulation uses a kinetic rather than thermal wind model , in which the initial wind speed is @xmath152 and the initial mass - loading factor is a factor of four , by construction .",
    "lastly , the work of @xcite has been extended to lower masses by @xcite , who managed to produce a pair of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath153 ) , which obey the observed `` baryonic tully - fisher '' relation and are therefore expected to have the correct baryon - to - halo mass fractions .    while these studies indicate that we may be heading toward a solution of the discrepancy between the observed and the expected baryon content of dark matter halos , many questions ( e.g. the expected outflow rates and re - accretion timescales ) remain unanswered .",
    "therefore , explaining in detail the mechanisms responsible for the very low @xmath21 values found in low - mass galaxies remains an open problem for studies of galaxy formation in a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "furthermore , our measurement of @xmath154 provides an additional constraint with which cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semianalytic models will have to confront .",
    "we use optical data from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr7 ) and 21 cm emission - line data from the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey to measure the `` baryonic mass '' ( defined as @xmath22 ) of galaxies in the local universe , and determine the @xmath143 baryon mass function ( bmf ) .",
    "we use both an hi - selected and an optically - selected sample ( 7195 and 22587 galaxies respectively ) drawn from the same volume , in order to address the effects of sample selection on the derived distributions .",
    "we find that the main difference consists of the optically - selected stellar mass function ( smf ) being systematically larger at high - masses than the hi - selected smf , and find that this difference carries over to the high - mass end of the bmf ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_vs_hi_gsmf ] & [ fig : opt_vs_hi_bmf ] ) .",
    "we combine the obtained mass distributions with the halo mass function in a wmap3 @xmath0cdm cosmology , to obtain average values of @xmath128 and @xmath135 as a function of halo mass ( fig . [",
    "fig : am1 ] & [ fig : am2 ] ) .",
    "our most important result is that low - mass halos seem to have very low galactic baryon fractions compared to the cosmic value ( @xmath2 ) , even when their atomic gas content is taken into account ; for example , the average baryon fraction of halos with @xmath155 is just 2% of the cosmic value ( @xmath156 ) , and displays a monotonically decreasing trend .",
    "this result contrasts with previous indirect measurements of the bmf @xcite , which pointed to an approximately constant value of @xmath157 at the low halo - mass end .",
    "such very low values of @xmath21 are difficult to reconcile with current models of galaxy formation .",
    "photoionization heating in the early universe suppresses the baryonic content of halos only at @xmath158 @xcite , but this mass is more than an order of magnitude smaller than what is required by our result .",
    "therefore , additional feedback mechanisms , such as baryon blowout by supernova explosions , must be present and must be extremely efficient .",
    "it is not yet clear whether hydrodynamic simulations or observational results can accommodate such intense galactic outflows in low mass halos . as a result",
    ", the observed @xmath21 - @xmath9 relation remains difficult to explain , and may represent a challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation and/or the properties of dark matter .",
