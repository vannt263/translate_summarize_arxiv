    "the so - called  lovelock gravity \" @xcite is a natural higher - curvature generalization of the einstein gravity .",
    "it includes the einstein - hilbert action as the first lovelock term , and the second term is known as the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term .",
    "the minimum generalization of the einstein gravity is the einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity theory , which contains up to the second lovelock term .",
    "since higher - curvature terms may come from quantum corrections of gravity , the egb gravity theory has been studied extensively .",
    "black hole solutions in the egb gravity theory were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the qualitative difference from the einstein gravity is the existence of branches of the solutions ; i.e. , not only minkowski spacetime but also anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime exists as a vacuum state in the egb gravity theory . as a result , the black hole solutions also possess both an asymptotically flat and ads branches without a negative cosmological constant .    in the context of the string theory ,",
    "the egb gravity has been argued to be an effective field theory with quantum corrections in @xcite .",
    "the gb term is indeed found as higher - order correction in string theories  @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to include a dilaton field as well as higher - curvature correction terms since the dilaton field plays an important role in the string theory .",
    "( the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton field gives the string coupling constant . ) in a dilatonic gravity theory , we should first choose a `` frame '' where we discuss and interpret the physical meanings .",
    "there are two fundamental frames : one is a string frame where a dilaton coupling is factored out in all terms in the action , while the other is the einstein frame where the scalar - curvature term is minimally coupled to a dilaton field .",
    "the string frame is the frame which is naturally defined in the string theory , while the einstein frame gives the einstein gravity , which is familiar to us , with higher - order corrections .    the gravity theory in the string frame and that in the einstein frame are classically equivalent since we can transform from one frame to the other by an appropriate conformal transformation  @xcite",
    "however , there appear extra higher - order terms via a conformal transformation in addition to the gravity action and the conventional kinetic term of a dilaton field , and those terms are sometimes ignored . as a result ,",
    "the two theories in these frames are different when we ignore such extra terms .",
    "we call those in the string frame and in the einstein frame degb ( dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet ) gravity and edegb (  einstein - frame \" degb ) gravity , respectively",
    ". the effective action in the einstein frame is obtained from the scattering amplitudes of gravitons and dilatons , but that in the string frame is calculated by the beta function method .",
    "thus , in the approximation keeping terms up to certain order in the higher derivatives , there are always ambiguities in the effective action as represented by the freedom of field redefinition .",
    "both of them have their own rights , and it is significant to study both and check if they give qualitatively different results .    most of the works on dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity have considered the edegb gravity theory .",
    "black hole solutions in the edegb gravity were studied for an asymptotically flat case in four dimensions  @xcite and higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the extremal black hole solutions , which are important in relation with bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld states in the supersymmetric theory , were studied in the edegb gravity in four dimensions  @xcite and higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the extremal black hole solutions in the degb gravity were also studied in  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the black holes in the edegb and the degb gravity theories was analyzed for asymptotically flat black hole solutions in  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the edegb and the degb is discussed from the viewpoint of einstein s equivalence principle in @xcite .",
    "ads spacetime is attracting increasing attention since the ads / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence was proposed . according to the ads / cft",
    ", one may examine the strong coupling region of the boundary cft by considering the corresponding black hole solutions in bulk ads spacetime .",
    "in fact , black hole solutions in the edegb were studied in @xcite , and the quantum corrections to the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density in the cft side were calculated .",
    "we expect that our solutions may also be useful in this kind of study .",
    "an ads black hole , which corresponds to the finite temperature cft according to the ads / cft correspondence , is known to possess interesting thermodynamical properties .",
    "when the horizon topology is a sphere ( @xmath0 ) , the small ads schwarzschild black hole is thermodynamically unstable while the large one is stable .",
    "there exists a phase transition , namely , hawking - page transition  @xcite , between the large ads black hole and a thermal ads space .",
    "in contrast , planar ( @xmath1 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath2 ) ads black holes are stable  @xcite and the hawking - page transition does not occur .    in the egb model with a negative cosmological constant , the thermodynamical properties of the asymptotically ads black hole solutions ( `` general relativity branch '' ) were studied in @xcite and with a special emphasis on the hyperbolic case in @xcite . in the presence of a negative cosmological constant @xcite , thermodynamic properties of asymptotically ads black hole solutions for @xmath0 are similar to those without the gauss - bonnet term in dimensions other than five . in five dimensions",
    "there appears a new phase of stable small black holes . for @xmath3 ,",
    "black hole solutions are thermodynamically stable , and for @xmath2 , black hole solutions are always stable .",
    "the asymptotically ads spacetimes in the edegb model were analysed with and without the cosmological constant  @xcite , and their global structures were studied in @xcite . in this paper , we consider black holes and other exact solutions in such spacetimes with a nontrivial dilaton field whose behavior is given by @xmath4 and discuss their thermodynamic properties .",
    "this type of dilaton field is called a linear dilaton , and it is essential for the existence of black hole solutions in the two - dimensional dilatonic gravity model  @xcite . in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity , linear dilaton solutions whose asymptotic behaviours are not ads nor de sitter were studied in @xcite .",
    "some of such solutions are obtained from asymptotically ads or de sitter solutions with a suitable compactification .",
    "intersecting brane solutions with linear dilatons are also constructed in @xcite .",
    "we find that ads black hole solutions for @xmath2 as well as ads spacetime for @xmath1 exist without a negative cosmological constant if the dilaton is nontrivial , in contrast to , for example , refs .",
    "the ads black hole solutions are obtained numerically , and the latter spacetime solutions are shown to exist for even - order lovelock gravity .",
    "we also find interesting cosmological and solitonic solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the degb gravity theory in the string frame and show that the ads spacetime is the exact solution in a plane symmetric case . then , in sec .",
    "iii , we show how to find asymptotically ads black hole solutions in the degb theory . in sec .",
