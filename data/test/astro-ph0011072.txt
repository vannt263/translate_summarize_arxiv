    "the first evidence for winds from cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) came from the discovery of p  cygni profiles in the uv resonance lines of ss  cygni ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence on the observability of cv winds with inclination angle and the apparent similarity between cataclysmic variable line profiles and those of ob stars led to the early suggestion by crdova & mason ( 1982 ) that the winds in cvs originate from the accretion disk and that the line radiation pressure is responsible for the wind .",
    "more recently , p  cygni profiles have been detected from virtually all nonmagnetic cvs with high mass accretion rates ( @xmath5 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption component is most apparent in low inclination systems , and is not detected in eclipsing systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "past efforts in the development of models for cv winds focused on one - dimensional models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and on kinematic modeling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which succeeded in showing consistency between the assumed polar geometry of a disk wind and observed profiles .",
    "icke  ( 1980 ) developed a two - dimensional disk wind model but did not take into account the radiation pressure due to line absorption . for a typical white dwarf mass of @xmath6 ( @xcite ) the disk luminosity required to produce such a wind without line radiation pressure ( assuming radiation pressure due to continuum scattering only ) would require a luminosity of @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , several magnitudes above the observed luminosity of cvs which vary between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "icke did find that for accretion disk winds in general , for sufficiently high disk luminosity , a biconical disk wind would be produced .",
    "icke  ( 1981 ) suggested that biconical winds were a general property of accretion disk winds independent of the wind driving mechanism .",
    "murray et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that for line - driven disk winds in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) the wind flow tends to be parallel to the accretion disk and developed a one - dimensional disk wind model for these systems .",
    "murray & chiang ( 1996 ) found that the single - peaked optical emission lines seen in agns and high - luminosity cvs could be accounted for by emission at the base of an accretion disk wind . using the disk wind model of murray et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , murray & chiang ( 1997 ) calculated synthetic line profiles of 1550  and found qualitative agreement between their models and observed line profiles . in the case of cvs ,",
    "as we discussed above , the winds are most apparent in low - inclination systems and not observed in eclipsing systems , indicating that the winds in cvs tend to flow perpendicular to the accretion disk .    in an earlier paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) we presented two - dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic models of line - driven accretion disk winds ( ldadw ) in cvs .",
    "to our knowledge these isothermal models were the first two - dimensional hydrodynamic models developed for ldadws .",
    "results from paper  i show , in analogy with line - driven winds from early type stars , that terminal velocities are approximately independent of the luminosity of the disk , although increments in luminosity produce increments in mass - loss rate . in paper",
    "i we showed that rotational forces are important in the study of winds from accretion disks , and that they cause the velocity streamlines to collide .",
    "the collision of streamlines reduce the speed and increase the density of the wind producing an enhanced density region . in paper",
    "i we also showed that the highest absorption occurs in the enhanced density region where density is increased relative to a spherically diverging wind with the same mass loss rate and the velocity is roughly half the terminal velocity .",
    "this density increase is necessary in order to produce at least marginally optically thick lines .",
    "recently proga , stone , & drew ( 1998 ) also developed two - dimensional models for these systems , obtaining similar results to the models presented here .",
    "when evaluating the line - radiation pressure from the disk , in order to make the computations manageable , they assumed that the velocity gradient is primarily along the `` z '' direction , as we also did in paper  1 and in the models presented here .",
    "proga , stone , & drew worked out their hydrodynamic model in spherical coordinates , while the models presented here were implemented in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "they found similar wind velocities and wind mass loss rates as we do here , although they assumed disk luminosities about an order of magnitude greater .",
    "a difference we find with the results of the models presented by proga , stone & drew ( 1998 ) is that they obtain unsteady flows characterized by large amplitude fluctuations in velocity and density , while for the models presented in this paper we find a steady flow .",
    "a shortcoming of our previous work , presented in paper  i , was that we had assumed an isothermal wind and an isothermal disk . in this work",
    "we develop a hydrodynamic model of ldadws in cvs which includes the radial structure of an optically thick accretion disk with the corresponding radiation fields and surface temperature distributions .",
    "we have also implemented the corresponding energy conservation equation for the models presented here self consistently ( see equation  [ 18 ] ) , including the adiabatic heating and cooling effects due to compression and expansion .    for the models presented in this paper we have also taken values presented by abbott  ( 1982 ) for the line radiation force multiplier parameters , rather than the earlier values used by castor , abbott , & klein  ( 1975 ) as we did in our isothermal models presented in paper  i.    from the results of the hydrodynamic model presented in this paper , we calculate theoretical line profiles for the 1550    line , and find that the line profiles obtained through our model are consistent with observations in their general form and strong dependence with inclination angle .",
    "thus we are able to predict the general observed wind properties of cvs .    the boundary layer where the disk intercepts the white dwarf and the white dwarf photosphere may also contribute to the radiation field .",
    "the white dwarf by itself ( without considering the effects of the accreting mass ) will have a luminosity of the order of @xmath8(@xcite ) , while the accretion disk will have typical luminosities of the order of @xmath10 . in a steady state accretion disk half of the energy of the accreting mass",
    "is converting into radiation emitted by the accretion disk . assuming a relatively slowly rotating compact star",
    ", it has been predicted that the boundary layer presents a luminosity approximately equal to the accretion disk , thus accounting for the other half of the energy of the accreting mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but there is still uncertainty concerning the existence and spectrum of the boundary layer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of observations have found , in some cases , a boundary layer luminosity an order of magnitude less than the disk luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in other cases a boundary layer luminosity comparable to disk luminosity ( @xcite ) . in the models presented here we have assumed that the radiation field is generated by the accretion disk alone and",
    "have therefore neglected any boundary layer or white dwarf radiation . in the future",
    "we plan to explore the effects of boundary layer radiation on our models .    in   2",
    "we discuss the radial structure of the accretion disk and the radiation field as implemented in our model . in   3 we derive the expression we use for the treatment of the line radiation pressure . in   4 we present and discuss the hydrodynamic calculations . in   5 we present and discuss theoretical 1550    line profiles and compare them with observations . in   6 we present a summary and conclusions of this work .",
    "cataclysmic variables are binary systems composed of a white dwarf , a main sequence star , and an accretion disk about the white dwarf . the disk is formed by mass accreting from the main sequence star to the white dwarf . in some objects strong magnetic fields ( @xmath11 )",
    "may prevent the accreting mass in cvs from forming a disk around the white dwarf ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we study the winds originating in nonmagnetic cvs in which an accretion disk is formed .",
    "direct observational evidence for the existence of accretion disks in cvs is found in the spectrum of eclipsing cvs . eclipsing cvs",
    "present double peaked h and he emission lines in their optical spectrum . in these systems",
    "the eclipse of the blue side of the emission line precedes that of the red side ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , demonstrating that the emission lines occupy an extended region and that it rotates about white dwarf in the direction expected for a disk formed through the accretion of mass from the secondary star .",
    "furthermore , synthetic emission lines that have been calculated from models of accretion disks rotating around the white dwarf have succeeded in accounting for the double peak features found in observations ( @xcite , 1981 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we wish to note here that single peaked , rather than double peaked , h and he emission lines with the same eclipse behavior ( eclipse of the blue wing preceding eclipse of the red wing ) are observed in many cvs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these single peaked balmer emission lines may be explained by the stark effect in the disk radiated emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or by line emission at the base of an accretion disk wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence for the existence accretion disks has been obtained through models for disk structure that have succeeded in accounting for the observed continuum shapes in many cvs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in most cases",
    "the luminosity of cvs is dominated by the radiation emitted by the accretion disk which is typically of order of the solar luminosity @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "cvs with high mass accretion rates ( dwarf novae in outburst , novae , and nova - like variables ) have luminosities which range between @xmath12 and @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .    in cataclysmic variables",
    "the disk radiation emission and disk temperature are radially dependent .",
    "such disks have been studied in detail by shakura and sunyaev  ( 1973 ) and we adopt their formulation in what follows .",
    "the accretion disk would have an inner radius approximately equal to the radius of the white dwarf ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1995 ) and an outer radius reaching out to two to three times less than the inner lagrangian point ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ( see figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "assuming that the disk is in a steady state , that the shear stress at the inner radius of the disk is negligible , and that the gas in the disk follows keplerian orbits one finds that the energy emitted per area @xmath13 at radius @xmath14 is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath15 \\;.\\ ] ] the luminosity of the disk @xmath16 may be obtained by integrating the energy emission per area @xmath13 over the surface of the disk .    assuming that the disk is emitting locally as a blackbody , and considering equation  ( 1 ) , we have that the radial temperature distribution of the disk will be @xmath17 \\right\\}^{1/4 }        \\ ; .\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "equation  ( 1 ) is implemented in our model , taking into account foreshortening and assuming local blackbody radiation , in the calculation of radiation flux throughout the wind , and consequently in the calculation of the continuum and line radiation pressure force .",
    "equation  ( 2 ) is implemented in our model as a boundary condition for the wind near the disk surface . in our model",
    "we assume that the temperature at the base of the wind is equal to the disk surface temperature for each radius .",
    "a crucial ingredient of the disk wind models is the description of the radiation pressure force per mass due to line scattering . in this section",
    "we derive the expression adopted for the accretion disk wind model .",
    "we obtain a more complex expression than in the isothermal models we presented in paper  i. the expression obtained here is based upon the radiation emitted by an accretion disk and includes not only the radiation pressure along the direction perpendicular to the disk , but also the radiation pressure parallel to the disk .    introducing the approximation that the velocity gradient is primarily in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the disk and using the opacity distribution developed by castor , abbott , & klein  ( 1975 ) , we obtain the following expression for the force per mass due to lines ( paper  i ) : @xmath19 \\hat{n } d\\omega \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the thomson cross section per unit mass , @xmath21 the specific intensity , @xmath22 the speed of light , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parameters dependent on temperature and the relative abundance of different elements , @xmath25 is the mass density , @xmath26 is the thermal sound speed , and @xmath27 is the component of the wind velocity in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "we wish to note here that although equation  ( 3 ) takes into account the line radiation pressure in the `` @xmath14 '' direction , we have included only the velocity gradient in the `` @xmath28 '' direction . as we will show in",
    "  4 , the accretion disk winds in cvs tend to flow in the direction perpendicular to the disk , particularly in the region near the surface of the disk , thus justifying the assumption of a velocity gradient primarily in the `` @xmath28 '' direction .",
    "although on one hand , incluying the velocity gradients en the `` @xmath14 '' direction may possibly produce interesting results , on the other we do not believe that it will significantly affect the overall results .",
    "also , as we show below , the assumption of a velocity gradient primarily in the `` @xmath28 '' direction allows us to obtain an expression for the line radiation pressure that requires the calculation of a spatial integration only once , rather than having to evaluate the spatial integrals at each time step , thus making the computations manageable .",
    "abbott  ( 1982 ) presented elaborate calculations for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters considering temperatures varying from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "he found that the @xmath23 parameter to be generally an order of magnitude greater than the earlier values presented by castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ) in which the line radiation parameters calculations were based on atomic line data of the .",
    "thus for the models presented in this paper we have used the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 , rather than the earlier values used by castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ) of @xmath33 and @xmath32 as we did in our isothermal models presented in paper  i. thus we feel confident that our formulation is approximately correct for disk temperatures throughout this range .",
    "we wish to note here that abbott  ( 1982 ) found values for @xmath24 which varied roughly between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and that as we have observed through our isothermal models ( paper  1 ) values of @xmath24 near @xmath34 will reduce significantly both the wind mass loss rate and the wind velocity . in our next paper",
    "we will implement local ionization equilibrium and calculate the @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters at each point of the wind rather than assuming fiducial values for these parameters throughout the wind as we have done up to now .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath24 used here and throughout this work is not the same as the parameter often used to describe accretion disk viscosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from equation",
    "( 3 ) we evaluate the angular dependence exactly , rather than introduce approximations for the angular dependence as we did for our isothermal models presented in paper  1 .",
    "therefore : @xmath36 \\hat{n } d\\omega \\ ; .\\ ] ] defining @xmath37 : @xmath38 \\hat{n } d\\omega \\ ; , \\ ] ] taking the source of radiation to be the accretion disk , we have @xmath39^{\\alpha+4 } }             \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr'\\ ] ] and @xmath40^{\\alpha+4 } }             \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding components of the vector @xmath43 defined in equation  ( 5 ) ( the @xmath44 component is zero due to the axial symmetry of the accretion disk ) and @xmath45 is the radiation emission per area of the disk calculated through equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by equations  ( 6 ) and ( 7 )",
    ".    we also account for the fact that , as can be seen from the appendix of paper  1 , if the velocity gradient increases to sufficiently high values , or the density of the wind decreases to sufficiently low values , the contribution for the radiation pressure due to lines arrives at a maximum value .",
    "abbott ( 1982 ) found that the maximum value of the line radiation pressure was obtained when @xmath47 . in this work",
    "we have assumed that the maximum possible value of the line radiation pressure is obtained when @xmath48 .",
    "we note that we may be overestimating the maximum value of @xmath49 , and thus the maximum value of the force multiplier .",
    "we do not expect this to cause a significant difference in the overall dynamics , particularly in the high density regions where most of the spectral lines are forming .",
    "this will be discussed again in   4.3  .",
    "in the future we shall include local ionization equilibrium into our models self consistently and calculate the line radiation force multiplier at each point in the wind in a manner equivalent to abbott s calculation for ob stars ( @xcite ) .",

    "we present the radiation flux perpendicular to the disk as a function of height for different radii .",
    "a peculiarity of the disk winds is that gravity increases along the streamlines . in our accretion disk wind models for large radii ( see figure  3 ) we find an increase in radiation flux with height along the streamlines also .",
    "this is necessary for wind driving . for small radii ( @xmath58 )",
    "( see figure  3 ) we observe little or no increase in radiation flux with height , but we do observe a significant increase in the radiation flux with decreasing radius ( @xmath59 a factor of @xmath60 between the innermost [ @xmath61 and outermost [ @xmath62 radii found in the spatial grids of our computational models ) . for the inner disk radii ( @xmath63 ) the radiation flux is locally super - eddington , and the gravity increase is overcome by the high radiation flux .",
    "our hydrodynamic model uses the piece - wise parabolic method ( ppm ) numerical scheme ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the 2.5-dimensional hydrodynamic equations of the wind in cylindrical coordinates .",

    "we wish to note here that our implementation of the ppm scheme in two dimensions in cylindrical coordinates ( `` z '' and `` r '' ) does not include the third term on the left hand side of equation  ( 16 ) , and that we have included and implemented this term in our models explicitly .",
    "we note also that the centrifugal and coriolis forces appear naturally under cylindrical coordinates as the third term of the left hand side in equation  ( 15 ) and the third term of the left hand side in equation  ( 16 ) .    in this treatment",
    "we have implemented the energy equation self consistently . in particular , the adiabatic heating and cooling effects are implemented through the first and second term on the right hand side of equation  ( 18 ) .",
    "the emission of the boundary layer is one of the major unsolved problems in the study of cataclysmic variables , and it is very closely related to the emission from the inner regions of the accretion disk . owing to the observational uncertainties discussed in the introduction , we have chosen not to include the boundary layer radiation in our current models . in the model presented here",

    "it is found that the energy emission per area @xmath13 will increase slightly as radius decreases from @xmath80 down to @xmath85 and will decrease strongly as radius decreases from @xmath85 down to the white dwarf radii ( @xmath86 ) .",

    "popham and narayan ( 1995 ) developed detailed models of boundary layers and accretion disks in cataclysmic variables and found that their models supported the same function @xmath87 for the accretion disk in cvs . in paper",
    "i we showed that the wind density tends to decrease with decreasing radiation flux .",
    "thus the the mass loss rate for radii less that @xmath88 will not alter significantly the total mass loss rate of the wind .",
    "as we discovered in paper  i , care must be taken with the boundary conditions to ensure not only a numerically stable solution but also a physically stationary one .",
    "the ppm scheme ( @xcite ) , in order to obtain the physical parameters ( velocity , density , pressure ) of the wind at a given point of the computational grid @xmath89 for a given time step @xmath90 , requires that at time @xmath91 the values of the physical parameter be known at the given spatial grid point ( @xmath89 ) , at the following two grid points ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , and at the previous two grid points ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "therefore , the boundary condition in ppm must be implemented by not only specifying the values of the physical parameters ( or leaving them free depending on the specific boundary condition ) at each grid point in the boundary of the spatial computational grid , but also by specifying the physical parameters at two grid points beyond each boundary grid point .",

    "the velocity along the @xmath28 direction is fixed at @xmath98 , which is a fiducial value of the sound speed at the photospheric height over the range of radii implemented in our model .",
    "we note that in the inner regions of the disk ( @xmath99 ) , where the temperature will be greater that @xmath100 ( equation  [ 2 ] ) , our boundary conditions will be subsonic . since the radial forces balance on the disk surface , the initial wind velocity must be normal to the surface of the disk , therefore the velocity along the @xmath14 direction is fixed at a value of @xmath101 .",

    "the mass density distribution is also quite similar except for a factor of @xmath108 in the density values of the newer models .",

    "in turn from the one - dimensional models presented in paper  1 we showed that , in analogy with early type stars , an increase in luminosity essentially leaves unaltered the wind velocities and increases the overall density in proportion to @xmath109 . thus our models in paper  1 indicate that an increase in a factor of @xmath110 in the @xmath23 parameter should produce an increase in overall density by a factor of @xmath111 which is consistent with the results presented in figure  5  .",
    "as seen in equation  ( 9 ) , in the accretion disk wind model presented here we have also taken into account the fact that if the velocity gradient increases to sufficiently high values , or the density decreases to sufficiently low values , the contribution for the radiation pressure due to lines arrives at a maximum value . in figure  6",
    "we show the results from a model in which we implement this condition . the models represented in figures  5 and 6 differ only in that former model does not implement a maximum value for the line radiation pressure while the latter does .",

    "we find that the `` z '' velocities components in the fore mentioned region in figure  5 ( @xmath112 ) are higher than the respective velocities in figure  6 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the region high above the inner disk area is a low density region since centrifugal forces have driven most of the mass towards larger `` @xmath14 '' ( towards the right in figures  5 and 6 ) at the corresponding heights ( @xmath114 ) . in turn",
    "the decrease in density in this region produces an increase in the line radiation pressure ( see equations  [ 3 ] and [ 9 ] ) which is allowed to increase indefinitely in the model of figure  5 , but may only increase up to a maximum value in the model of figure  6 .",
    "second , we also find that the implementation of a maximum value for the force multiplier also produces an increase in density in the region near the base of the wind by a factor of @xmath115  .",
    "in our accretion disk wind model we also introduced an adiabatic wind rather than an isothermal wind as we assumed in paper  1 . in figure  7",
    "we show results from a model which implements an adiabatic wind .",
    "the models represented in figures  6 and 7 differ only in that former model assumes an isothermal wind while the latter assumes an adiabatic wind .",
    "we do not find significant changes in the density distributions or the wind velocity field when we implement an adiabatic wind rather than an isothermal wind ( see figures  6 and 7 ) .",
    "another element that we have introduced in our accretion disk wind model is the radial structure of radiation emission ( equation  [ 1 ] ) and temperature of disk surface ( equation  [ 2 ] ) , rather than assume an isothermal disk as we did in the models presented in paper  1 . in figure  8",
    "we show results from our accretion disk wind model .",
    "the models represented in figure  7 and figure  8 differ in that former assumes an isothermal disk ( and therefore a uniform temperature and radiation emission distribution over the disk surface ) and neglects the radiation pressure along the `` @xmath14 '' direction , while the latter assumes a radial temperature and radiation emission distribution as described in   2 and includes the radiation pressure along the `` @xmath14 '' direction .    comparing the results shown in figures  7 and 8",
    ", we note that the enhanced density region above the disk extends from the mid - region of the disk in figure  7 , while in figure  8 the enhanced density region extends from the inner region of the disk .",
    "this difference is due to the assumption of an isothermal disk in the figure  7 model which produces a uniform density distribution at the base of the wind , while in figure  8 the higher radiation emission from the inner disk region ( equation  [ 1 ] ) produces in turn a higher density at the inner region than in the outer region at the base of the wind .",
    "the radial radiation emission structure of the accretion disk wind model causes the density in the inner region of the disk at the base of the wind to be higher than the corresponding density at the same region in the isothermal disk model ( see figures  7 and 8) .",
    "this in turn causes an increase in the overall wind mass loss rate by a factor of @xmath115 in the accretion disk wind model ( figure  8) with respect to the isothermal disk wind model ( figure  7 ) .",
    "the results shown in figure  8 allow us to estimate the validity of our neglect of radiative cooling .",
    "we present here rough estimates of the radiative cooling times and compare them with dynamical time scales .",
    "blondin ( 1994 ) obtained an analytical expression for radiative cooling in high - mass x - ray systems .",
    "he found for wind temperatures on the order of @xmath116 a radiative cooling coefficient of @xmath117 .",
    "rough estimates for the cooling times may be obtained through the following expression @xmath118 , where @xmath23 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath119 is the temperature , and @xmath120 is the particle density . from the results of figure  8 ( discussed below ) we obtain the following rough estimates for the radiative cooling times : lower inner region ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) @xmath123 ; lower outer region ( @xmath124 , @xmath122 ) @xmath125 ; higher inner region ( @xmath121 , @xmath126 ) @xmath127 ; higher outer region ( @xmath124 , @xmath126 ) @xmath128 . a rough estimate of the dynamical time maybe obtained by @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "viewing figure  8 we note that radiative cooling time in the high density areas tend to be comparable to or larger than the dynamical time .",
    "this suggests that in some parts of this region , radiative cooling may be important and the eos could be described as isothermal . in the lower density areas the radiative cooling time scales tend to be much larger than the dynamic time scale , thus indicating that for this region the eos would be best described as adiabatic .",
    "these estimates are uncertain by factors of an order of magnitude or more , owing to the fact that they assume optically thin line cooling and are not tailored to the conditions specific to cv winds .",
    "however , they provide motivation for our future work , in which we shall include radiative heating and cooling in our models .",
    "the spatial computational grid in the @xmath28 direction has @xmath131 points , ranging from the photospheric height to @xmath132 , distributed such that @xmath133 is uniform .",
    "the number of grid points for the spatial computational grid in the @xmath14 direction was set at different values which varied from @xmath134 to @xmath135 distributed uniformly .",
    "we obtain similar results for each of the grid resolutions implemented within the above range .",
    "a vector field graph of wind velocity superimposed with a contour graph of wind density is presented in figure  8 for the low resolution model . a vector field graph of wind velocity superimposed with a contour graph of wind temperature",
    "is presented in figure  9  .",
    "the physical parameters used are : @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "we obtain the following values for the mass - loss rate and terminal velocity for our two - dimensional accretion disk wind model : @xmath3 ( obtained by integrating at the photospheric height ) and @xmath139 .",
    "we note that the wind mass loss rate we find for our accretion disk wind model is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the value we found in paper  i for our isothermal models .",
    "this is due to three reasons : first , the radiation field above the inner region of disk in the accretion disk wind models presented in this work is stronger than in the models presented in paper  i in which we assumed an isothermal disk .",
    "second , we have used a more recent and larger value for the @xmath23 force multiplier parameter in our accretion disk wind model . for the line radiation pressure , the effect of increasing @xmath23 is equivalent to increasing luminosity ( see equations  [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , and [ 9 ] ) . as we had shown in paper",
    "i , through our one - dimensional isothermal models , an increase in disk luminosity produces a corresponding increase in wind mass - loss rate .",
    "third , in our accretion disk wind model we implement the fact that , if the velocity gradient increases to sufficiently high values or the density of the wind decreases to sufficiently low values , the contribution for the radiation pressure due to lines arrives at a maximum value ( see equation  [ 9 ] ) .",
    "this causes a decrease in the line radiation pressure in the regions of the wind where this phenomena occurs .",
    "of these three factors , the second , the use of a larger and more recent value for @xmath23 , is the most important , accounting for slightly more than a order magnitude increase in the wind mass loss rate .    in figure  10",
    "we show results obtained from the low resolution model ( @xmath134 computational grid points in the @xmath14 direction ) and from the high resolution model ( @xmath135 computational grid points in the @xmath14 direction ) , and as stated above we find similar results ( the density contour values on both figures  10_a _ and 10_b _ are the same ) .",
    "we note structure in the density contours in the @xmath135 computational grid which is not apparent in the density contours in the @xmath134 computational grid .",
    "figures  10_a _ and 10_b _ are shown at the same physical times , in which steady flows have been obtained .",
    "the motivation for the high resolution models was to ensure that the overall results of our low resolution models were not affected by the selection of vertical computational grid .",
    "comparing figures  10_a _ and 10_b _ we note structure in the density contours in the @xmath135 computational grid which is not apparent in the density contours in the @xmath134 computational grid .",
    "we have not yet fully explored the density spikes in the high resolution model . however , the average properties of the flow such as total mass loss rate and gross structures , are equivalent in the two models .    in figure  11",
    "we show results obtained from a model with a height of @xmath103 at the lower computational grid boundary ( figure  11_b _ ) and compare it with the results from a model with a height of @xmath96 at the lower computational grid boundary ( figure  11_a _ ) ( @xmath96 is the lower computational boundary used in the models presented elsewhere in this paper ) .",
    "the density contour values on both figures  11_a _ and 11_b _ are the same . as we indicated in",
    "4.2 , these two heights correspond to the photospheric height in the innermost radius of our computational grid ( @xmath140 ) and to the photospheric height in the radius of @xmath141 respectively .    in the models with lower photospheric heights we did not increase the number of grid points in the photospheric region .",
    "the motivation for this is that in the region between the original photospheric height and the smaller values , the radiation field is not changing considerably .",
    "this , added to the consideration that this region is appreciably smaller than the total spatial computational grid , would indicate that a finer vertical grid should produce no significant difference , while considerably increasing the cpu time required for the actual runs .    in figure  12",
    "we present a vector field graph of wind velocity superimposed with a contour graph of density for the accretion disk wind model with the same physical parameters , but implementing a reflecting wall boundary condition for the left side of the computational grid .",
    "that is , the values for the physical parameters ( velocity , density , and pressure ) are left free at the grid points in the left computational boundary , and are therefore recalculated at each time step .",
    "`` mirrored ''",
    "values are implemented at the ghost zones for the physical parameters for the reflecting wall boundary conditions . with the reflecting wall boundary condition",
    "we obtain quite similar results ( see figures  8 and 12 ) .",
    "we wish to note that in figure  12 the `` r '' components of the velocity in the upper region at the inner left boundary do not indicate that there is a mass flow coming from the inner left boundary , but rather that the gas pressure is overcome by centrifugal forces in this region .",
    "we also wish to note that in the reflecting wall boundary condition the grid points on the left computational boundary are not at the `` wall '' , but rather near the `` wall '' .",
    "the `` wall '' would be located in between the boundary grid points and the `` ghost zone '' grid points ( see   4.2 ) .    in figure  13",
    "we show results obtained from the low resolution model ( figure  13_a _ ) and two additional high resolution models ( figures  13_b _ and 13_c _ ) .",
    "as stated above the low resolution model contains @xmath134 computational grid points in the @xmath14 direction ranging from @xmath79 ( @xmath142 ) to @xmath81 , and @xmath131 grid points in the @xmath28 direction ranging from @xmath143 to @xmath144 . in this figure",
    "we show the results of the low resolution model up to @xmath84 in both directions in order to present them at the same scale as figures  13_b _ and 13_c_. the high resolution models represented in figure  13_b _ and 13_c _ have @xmath135 grid points in the @xmath14 direction ranging up to @xmath84 , and @xmath145 grid points in the @xmath28 direction ranging from @xmath146 to @xmath84 .",
    "figures  13_b _ and 13_c _ differ in that in the former the grid points in the @xmath14 direction range down to @xmath79 ( @xmath142 ) , while in the latter the grid points in the @xmath14 direction range down to @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "as we stated above we find similar results between the low and the high resolution models .",
    "the velocity fields are essentially the same and the density in the corresponding region are of the same magnitude .",
    "although we do find more structure in the density contours of the high resolution models , which are not apparent in the low resolution models . in the high resolution models we also find that near the disk surface towards larger radii lower densities are obtained .",
    "the motivation for the additional high resolution models was to ensure that the overall results of our models would not be affected by a more detailed modeling of the wind intiation region through the increase of the physical resolution on one hand and by including in the models the region between @xmath149 on the other .",
    "we wish to note here that in the figures  13_a _ , 13_b _ , and 13_c _ the velocity vectors presented with the lowest @xmath28 are the lowest @xmath28 in which the velocity vectors are plotted , the actual computational grid starts at a lower @xmath28 as described above in this paragraph .    an important feature of the two - dimensional accretion disk wind model results , the role of rotational forces , is apparent in figures  8 and 9  .",
    "the centrifugal forces cause the streamlines from the inner region of the disk to bend and to collide with streamlines of material originating at larger radii .",
    "this collision generates a large region of enhanced density which runs diagonally in the @xmath28-@xmath14 plane ( this effect was also observed in paper  i for our two - dimensional isothermal models ) .",
    "an important consequence of the enhanced density region is the corresponding increase in the line optical depth .",
    "icke  ( 1981 ) suggested that biconical winds were a general property of accretion disk winds independent of the wind driving mechanism , and that this was caused by the geometry of the disk wind and by the rotation of the disk . in this work",
    "we have confirmed this suggestion .",
    "we find that the principal driving mechanism for accretion disk winds in cvs is the line radiation pressure and that for our two - dimensional models we find that centrifugal forces , which are caused by the rotation of the disk , produce an enhanced density region which is biconical in nature ( figure  8) .",
    "in order to further study line - driven accretion disk winds we calculate  1550    line profiles from our accretion disk wind model .",
    "we then study the line profiles calculated at different angles and compare them with observations .",
    "the line profiles presented here ( figure  14 ) were calculated assuming single scattering and a relative abundance of carbon with respect to hydrogen of @xmath150 throughout the wind . the radiation was assumed to have originated on the surface of the disk , according to equation  ( 1 ) , in consistency with our model .",
    "the angles for the line of sight with respect to the disk rotation axis were discretized into eighteen values : from @xmath151 to @xmath152 in @xmath153 increments .",
    "we wish to note here that although the three - dimensional hydrodynamic equations were reduced to and implemented in two dimensions through azimuthal symmetry ( 2.5-dimensional ) , the line profiles were calculated in three dimensions .    for a given point source on the disk surface and a given direction ,",
    "the geometric line starting from the given point and having the given direction , was divided into several segments as it intersected the spatial computational grid .",
    "a three - dimensional computational grid was formed by rotating the spatial grid used in the hydrodynamic calculations along the @xmath64 direction .",
    "continuous values of @xmath64 were used to calculate the intersections . over each of these segments the optical depth for each frequency bin , corresponding to a given velocity bin , was obtained by taking into account the ion thermal speed @xmath26 and applying the expression @xmath154 along a sobolev length ( a sobolev length is defined as the distance along which the wind velocity varies by a value equal to the sound speed ) .",
    "that is , for a given point source on the disk surface and a given direction , the following equations are implemented : @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the optical depth for frequency @xmath160 , @xmath161 is the component of the wind velocity along the given direction , @xmath26 is the thermal speed , @xmath25 is the wind density , @xmath162 is the line opacity for 1550   , @xmath163 is the resonance frequency for 1550   , @xmath22 is the speed of light , @xmath164 is the intensity for frequency @xmath160 for non - scattered radiation along the given direction , and @xmath165 is the intensity for frequency @xmath160 along the given direction at the disk surface .",
    "we note here that the above calculations were done in the vicinity of the 1550    resonance frequency in order to calculate the corresponding line profiles .",
    "the total optical depth , for a given point source on the disk surface , for a given direction , for a given velocity bin , was calculated by summing over the contributions of each segment described above . in the line profiles calculations presented here",
    "it was assumed that the radiation absorbed at each segment is scattered isotropically , and to therefore contribute uniformly to the radiation in each direction . for each direction of scattered radiation ,",
    "the velocity of the wind was taken into account through doppler shifts , and then added on to the corresponding velocity bin .",
    "the velocity component along the @xmath64 direction was taken into account consistently throughout the line profile calculations .",
    "finally , after implementing all of the corresponding integrals , the contribution of the scattered and non - scattered radiation for each velocity bin was summed for each observation angle and the line profiles obtained .",
    "the velocity values were discretized in bins of @xmath166 .",
    "although this bin size is greater that the ion thermal speed ( @xmath167 ) it is much less than the wind velocities and emission line widths that characterize line profiles in cvs ( @xmath168 ) .    for low inclination angles ( @xmath169 ) our model predicts p  cygni profiles .",
    "the blue - shifted absorption line presents a maximum absorption at roughly half the terminal velocity , which is consistent with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this feature distinguishes the p  cygni line profiles from cvs from the p  cygni line profiles seen from early type stars whose blue - shifted absorption line presents a maximum absorption at the terminal velocity ( @xcite )",
    ". furthermore the absorption line corresponds to velocities in the order of @xmath170 , which also agrees with observations .",
    "for example , the line profile in figure  16 shows a strong similarity to the line profiles observed from rw  sex ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which has an inclination angle of @xmath171 ( @xcite ) .    for low inclination angles close to the orbital axis ( @xmath172 )",
    "our models predict p  cygni profiles with a double peaked absorption lines ( see figure  15 ) .",
    "such features have been reported in low inclination cvs .",
    "figure  15 may be compared with the line profiles observed in hr  del ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has an inclination angle of @xmath173 ( @xcite ) .    for intermediate and high inclination angles ( @xmath174 )",
    "our model predicts p  cygni profiles without the absorption component , which is also consistent with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for intermediate inclination angles ( @xmath175 )",
    "our model predicts p  cygni profiles with double peaked emission lines ( see figure  17 ) .",
    "such features have been reported in intermediate inclination cvs .",
    "figure  17 may be compared with the line profiles observed in ux  uma ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has an inclination angle of @xmath176 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our models suggest that the double peaked emission line observed in cvs may be interpreted as a wind feature .    for high inclination angles ( @xmath177 )",
    "our model predicts p  cygni profiles with single peaked emission lines with a fwhm in the order of @xmath178 ( see figure  18 )",
    ". singled peaked emission lines are observed in high inclination cvs .",
    "figure  18 may be compared with the line profiles observed in rw  tri ( @xcite ) , which has an inclination angle of @xmath179 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for nearly perpendicular inclination angles ( @xmath180 ) our model predicts p  cygni profiles with single peaked emission lines , with a value of the fwhm about @xmath181 less than high inclinations , presenting two satellite peaks due to emission by material near the disk surface ( see figure  19 ) .",
    "figure  19 may be compared with the line profiles observed in dq  her ( @xcite ) , which has an inclination angle of @xmath182 ( @xcite ) and which shows a comparable fwhm and two satellite peaks .",
    "thus the line profiles for ( 1550   ) obtained through our computational accretion disk wind model are consistent with observations in their general form , in particular in the maximum absorption at roughly half the terminal velocity for the blue - shifted component , in the magnitudes of the wind velocities implied by the absorption components , in the fwhm of the emission components , and in the strong dependence in inclination angle .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize that the models presented here do not self consistently calculate the wind ionization balance and therefore can only be considered as a preliminary indication that our models are consistent with observations .",
    "we plan to present more accurate models in our next paper .",
    "we have developed a 2.5-dimensional hydrodynamic line - driven adiabatic accretion disk wind model .",
    "our model solves a complete set of adiabatic hydrodynamic partial differential equations , using the ppm numerical scheme and implementing the radial temperature and radiation emission distributions on the surface of an accretion disk . from our models we calculate wind mass - loss rates , terminal velocities , and line profiles for",
    "( 1550   ) for various angles . for typical cataclysmic variable parameter values of disk luminosity @xmath0 , white dwarf mass @xmath1 , and white dwarf radii @xmath2 , we obtain a wind mass - loss rate of @xmath3 , and a terminal velocity of @xmath183 .",
    "studies of observed ultraviolet line profiles from cvs have estimated cv wind mass loss rates to be in the order of @xmath184 to @xmath185 and found cv wind terminal speeds in the order of @xmath186 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , thus the models developed in this work predict values for wind mass loss rates and terminal speed consistent with observations .",
    "furthermore , the line profiles we obtain through our computational model are also consistent with observations in their general form , in particular in the maximum absorption at roughly half the terminal velocity for the blue - shifted component , in the magnitudes of the wind velocities implied by the absorption components , in the fwhm of the emission components , and in the strong dependence in inclination angle .",
    "we have shown that rotational forces are important in the study of winds from accretion disks .",
    "they cause the velocity streamlines to collide which results in an enhanced density region . in this region",
    "the wind speed is reduced and the wind density is increased . the increase in density caused by the collision of streamlines is important because it permits the appearance of blue - shifted absorption lines as observed in p  cygni profiles of low - inclination cvs .",
    "a shortcoming of our models is the neglect of radiative cooling and heating and local ionization equilibrium throughout the wind . in the next paper of this series",
    "we will present models which include these effects .",
    "we also plan to extend our models to the study of the wind dynamics of low mass x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei , where these processes may play a more important role in determining the overall dynamics .",

    "<S> we present here numerical hydrodynamic simulations of line - driven accretion disk winds in cataclysmic variable systems . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate wind mass - loss rate , terminal velocities , and line profiles for ( 1550   ) for various viewing angles . </S>",
    "<S> the models are 2.5-dimensional , include an energy balance condition , and calculate the radiation field as a function of position near an optically thick accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the model results show that centrifugal forces produce collisions of streamlines in the disk wind which in turn generate an enhanced density region , underlining the necessity of two dimensional calculations where these forces may be represented . for disk luminosity @xmath0 , white dwarf mass @xmath1 , and white dwarf radii @xmath2 , we obtain a wind mass - loss rate of @xmath3 , and a terminal velocity of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the line profiles we obtain are consistent with observations in their general form , in particular in the maximum absorption at roughly half the terminal velocity for the blue - shifted component , in the magnitudes of the wind velocities implied by the absorption components , in the fwhm of the emission components , and in the strong dependence in inclination angle . </S>"
