    "the mechanical response of materials with discrete micro- or meso - structures such as 3d - printed structures , woven textiles , paper , or foams can be modelled with dissipative lattice networks , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these models consists in their conceptual simplicity , because lattice springs or beams can be identified as individual fibres or yarns of the underlying structure .",
    "therefore , material parameters such as young s or hardening moduli , and constitutive damage or plasticity laws can be determined in a relatively straightforward manner .",
    "furthermore , lattice networks incorporate large deformations and yarn reorientations rather easily compared to phenomenological continuum models , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for heterogeneous cohesive - frictional materials such as concrete , lattice networks are capable of capturing distributed microcracking , the heterogeneity at the microscale , and size effects ; applications and further discussions can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of lattice structures is their considerable computational cost  which may well be prohibitive for engineering applications , in which the lattice spacing is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the problem size .",
    "ergo , multiscale , or reduced - order modelling methods are required to tackle realistic applications .",
    "a reduced - order modelling method with a concurrent multiscale character is the quasicontinuum  ( qc ) method .",
    "it was originally designed for conservative atomistic systems at the nano - scale level , see  @xcite for its initial formulation and  @xcite for various extensions .",
    "this approach was further generalized to tackle materials at the meso - scale level by introducing dissipation along with internal variables in a virtual - power - based format by  @xcite and in a variational format by  @xcite .",
    "in its essence , the qc methodology resolves the underlying lattice only in small regions of interest , whereas it coarsens it elsewhere .",
    "this results in a considerable reduction of the number of degrees of freedom  ( dofs ) , internal variables , and effort to construct the governing equations .",
    "the problem of interest in this contribution is the combination of the qc method and crack propagation in damageable lattice structures , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation ] . because most of the dissipation and fibre reorientation occurs near the crack tip",
    ", this region must be fully resolved . to this end , a mesh indicator that follows the evolution of the crack tip needs to be provided .",
    "such an approach typically leaves a trail of the fully resolved region in the wake of the crack if no coarsening is included , cf .",
    "it may be clear that , apart from allowing the crack to open up , these fully resolved regions do not contribute to the overall physics and accuracy .",
    "it is therefore desirable to coarsen them .",
    "however , this coarsening should take into account the effect which the crack has on the local , coarse - scale kinematics of the problem ",
    "i.e . it should allow an arbitrary amount of crack opening without any mechanical resistance .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to provide a refinement _ and _ coarsening strategy that allows for the removal of nodes in the wake of the crack tip to increase the efficiency of the variational qc method .",
    "because the damage in the crack wake is highly localized , it can be treated as a `` discontinuity '' , although the system is obviously discrete .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to introduce techniques known from the extended finite element method  ( xfem ) , @xcite , or generalized finite element method  ( gfem ) , @xcite , that rely on the partition of unity  ( pu ) concept , @xcite .",
    "a certain similarity to the particle partition of unity method  ( ppum ) , @xcite , can be also observed .",
    "namely , the space of interpolation functions is enriched to also include `` jumps '' in kinematic as well as in internal variables . as will be explained below , and demonstrated in the examples section , such an enrichment provides an accurate and efficient framework to model cracks in damageable lattices . in",
    "what follows , this approach will be referred to as the _ extended qc _ ( in analogy to continuum systems ) , or _",
    "x - qc _ for short .    several previous works have focused on adaptivity and coarsening in qc methodologies as well , but these mainly dealt with conservative , atomistic lattice models , cf .",
    "an xfem - type qc framework was reported in  @xcite , which treated atomistic models within the scope of molecular dynamics and the bridging domain method ( concurrent coupling between the atomistic and continuum regions ) .",
    "in contrast to these previous works , this contribution focuses on structural lattice networks at the meso - scale level .",
    "moreover , we employ the _ dissipative _ variational qc with damage , including a _ fully non - local _ formulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : varform ] , we briefly recall the theory of rate - independent systems on which the variational qc is built . for simplicity ,",
    "only time - discrete versions of all equations are provided .",
    "having specified the theoretical background , we can introduce the model at hand , its geometry , state variables , and energies driving the evolution .",
    "the main developments of this contribution , i.e. the interpolation and summation qc steps revisited from the point of view of lattice structures with localized damage , are discussed in section  [ sect : qc ] .",
    "namely , the enrichment functions together with the required changes in the summation rules are introduced in detail .",
    "the numerical solution strategy is addressed in section  [ sect : sol ] .",
    "two examples demonstrate the additional efficiency of the proposed method .",
    "the results show that the coarsening strategy , in particular , allows one to reduce the number of dofs to approximately 25   75% of that of an adaptive qc without coarsening , with no significant increase in error .",
    "the number of dofs reduces to 1  ",
    "@xmath0 of that of the direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "the corresponding computing times are reduced by a factor of 4   20 , depending on the particular example .",

    "in this section , the basic principles of the variational formulation of rate - independent systems in the context of lattice networks are recalled . for the sake of brevity ,",

    "[ subsect : nodeprotection : fig:1 ] , the normalized interaction energy can be seen to drop from  @xmath116 to  @xmath117 over just two to three lattice spacings . from this",

    "<S> lattice networks with dissipative interactions are often employed to analyze materials with discrete micro- or meso - structures , or for a description of heterogeneous materials which can be modelled discretely . </S>",
    "<S> they are , however , computationally prohibitive for engineering - scale applications . </S>",
    "<S> the ( variational ) quasicontinuum  ( qc ) method is a concurrent multiscale approach that reduces their computational cost by fully resolving the ( dissipative ) lattice network in small regions of interest while coarsening elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to damageable lattices , moving crack tips can be captured by adaptive mesh refinement schemes , whereas fully - resolved trails in crack wakes can be removed by mesh coarsening . in order to address </S>",
    "<S> crack propagation efficiently and accurately , we provide in this contribution an adaptive meshing scheme for the variational qc method . to deal with coarsening </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt enrichment functions and the partition of unity concept . for the description of crack geometries , </S>",
    "<S> the signed distance function is used . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , necessary changes in the summation rule are presented . finally , as our standpoint is variational , we discuss implications of the mesh refinement and coarsening from an energy - consistency point of view . </S>",
    "<S> all theoretical considerations are demonstrated using two numerical examples for which the resulting reaction forces , energy evolutions , and crack paths are compared to those of the direct numerical simulations .    </S>",
