    "recently there has been much interest in studying qcd in terms of ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting question is the study of nucleon in the dense matter system .",
    "baryons in ads / cft was first introduced by witten in @xcite , where baryon is identified with a compact d - brane wrapping the directions transverse to the @xmath0 color d - branes with @xmath0 strings attached to it .",
    "the baryon charge is carried by the end point of the strings connecting color and flavor branes .",
    "after the chiral model of sakai - sugimoto@xcite was developed , baryon was discussed as the instanton on the probe branes @xcite and effective field theory of baryon was developed in @xcite in the context of phenomenological ads / qcd model @xcite .",
    "the baryon density problem was first discussed in @xcite where chemical potential is identified as the asymptotic value of the electric potential on the flavor brane .",
    "the d3/d7 system of finite temperature and finite baryon density was analyzed in @xcite where both minkowski embedding as well as the black hole embedding were considered .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that in the presence of the quark density the d7 brane has to touch the black hole horizon because the strings connecting d7 and the horizon can be replaced by the spiky deformation of the d7 brane .",
    "so it is an interesting to ask what happens if there are baryons not just quarks .    in the presence of baryon vertex ( outside the black - hole horizon )",
    ", the string would not touch the horizon and there would be no reason for the spiky d - brane to touch the horizon",
    ". see figure 1-a .",
    "the issue is then whether there is a baryon vertex @xcite for the given background and given probe branes .",
    "the probe branes are pulling the baryon vertex to sustain it from the gravitational pulling of the core , and it is not obvious why a compact d - brane does / doesnt exist in such background a priori . see figure 1b .",
    "if a bv configuration does not exist in the black - hole background , it is not clear whether it exist even at the confining background .",
    "this question is even more compelling since in d4-d8@xmath1 setup , a baryon vertex can exist regardless whether d4 background is in the confining or deconfining phase @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    one of the purpose of this paper is to examine this issue in various gravity backgrounds with the probe probe branes using the equation of motion and force balancing condition ( fbc ) .",
    "we will find that there exist baryon vertex ( bv ) only in some of the confining backgrounds , while no such object in any of the black hole backgrounds .    in case",
    "there are baryons , interesting question is the density dependence of the baryon mass when baryon vertex exists . here",
    "the central issue is whether there is any canonical definition of mass in the absence of lorentz symmetry . in field theory , to separate the baryon mass in the medium from the inter - baryon interaction energy has ambiguity .",
    "however , in the bv picture , one can define the baryon mass in the medium simply as the energy of deformed bv and we can attribute the deformation of the the probe brane to the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "we show numerically that mass drops as density increases for baryons with heavy quarks , while mass v.s density profile has a minimum for baryons with light quarks .",
    "the latter behavior is shared by the systems d4/d6 and d4/d8@xmath28 .",
    "the rest of the paper goes as follows . in section 2 , we study numerically to show that in the black hole background , there is no compact d - brane as a solution of a dbi action . in section 3 ,",
    "we show that there are solutions for the baryon vertices in some confining backgrounds and study the density dependence of the baryon mass . here",
    "we give a full details for the d4/d6 system and leave other cases to the appendix .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we consider d6 probe branes embedded in the non - extremal black d4 background and show that the solution of a dbi action for the baryon vertex satisfying the force balance condition does not exist .",
