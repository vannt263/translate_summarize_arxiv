    "advanced gravitational wave detectors such as advanced ligo @xcite and advanced virgo @xcite are being constructed with the goal of a tenfold increase in sensitivity over the first generation of detectors @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is expected to be sufficient to make the first conclusive gravitational wave detection .",
    "the projected sensitivity of both advanced ligo and advanced virgo will be limited over the observation frequency band by several fundamental noise sources : seismic noise , radiation pressure noise , suspension thermal noise , shot noise , and thermal noise of the test masses themselves @xcite . the dominant contribution to the total thermal noise of the test masses",
    "is expected to be from the brownian motion of the atoms that make up the reflective coatings .",
    "this motion causes an uncertainty in the phase of the light reflected from the test mass , and will therefore appear as noise in the detector output .",
    "this thermal noise has until now not been a limiting noise source in detectors , but as progress within the field pushes other noise sources ever lower , its mitigation becomes a more urgent priority .",
    "one way to reduce the effects of the coating brownian thermal noise is to use a larger beam spot on the test mass surfaces , since a larger beam averages more effectively over the random motions of the surface .",
    "the coating brownian thermal noise power spectral density has been shown to scale with the inverse square of the gaussian beam size parameter @xmath0 @xcite . however , as the beam spots are made larger , a larger fraction of the light power is lost over the edge of the reflective surface .",
    "this fraction is known as the _ clipping loss_. if one uses a beam with a more homogeneous radial intensity distribution than the commonly used lg@xmath1 beam , the brownian thermal noise level can be reduced without increasing the clipping loss .",
    "such beams are often referred to as _",
    "flat _ beams .",
    "candidate flat beams for gravitational wave detectors include mesa beams @xcite , optimised conical beams @xcite and higher - order lg beams @xcite .",
    "higher - order lg modes have the advantage over other flat beams of being theoretically compatible with the spherical mirror surfaces that are currently used with the lg@xmath1 mode .",
    "equation [ eqn : lghxamp ] shows the complex amplitude function for the helical higher - order mode set , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the radial mode index , @xmath4 is the azimuthal mode index , @xmath5 is the beam radius , @xmath6 is the wave - number , @xmath7 is the complex gaussian beam parameter , @xmath8 are the associated laguerre polynomials , and @xmath9 is the gouy phase , given by @xmath10 the order of a higher - order lg mode is given by @xmath11 .",
    "an alternative sinusoidal form of lg modes with a sinusoidal amplitude dependence in azimuthal angle can be used equally well . in this article",
    "we will discuss the research performed by the birmingham group towards evaluating the feasibility of lg mode technology for implementation in detectors of the advanced generation and beyond to reduce the test mass thermal noise limit .",
    "our initial step was to compare the interferometric performance of the lg@xmath12 mode to the lg@xmath1 mode in an optical layout similar to that proposed for the advanced detectors . by interferometric performance",
    "we mean the level of coupling of a number of variables to the measured phase ( ` phase noise analysis ' ) , the ability to generate the required longitudinal and alignment control signals , and finally the maximum achievable detector sensitivity .",
    "the first consideration to ensure a fair analysis of the performance of the lg@xmath12 mode was the beam sizes which should be compared . a realistic design for advanced detectors will push towards larger beam sizes on the test masses , irrespective of the spatial mode used , since the limiting brownian noise level scales with the inverse square of the beam size .",
    "the limit on beam size can be enforced either by the point at which the clipping loss becomes unacceptably high , or the point at which cavities become unacceptably close to the unstable concentric design required for maximising beam sizes . for this study we considered the limit to be enforced by the clipping loss , which we fixed at 1ppm .",
    "the higher - order lg modes are more spatially extended , and thus have larger clipping losses than the lg@xmath1 mode for a given beam spot size parameter .",
    "the ratio between lg@xmath1 spot size and lg@xmath12 spot size required to give a 1ppm clipping loss on the same mirror is @xmath13 . in the rest of this section",
    "we will compare the performance of three different configurations for a symmetric 3 km cavity , to be referred to as the lg@xmath12 , lg@xmath14 and lg@xmath15 configurations .",
    "the lg@xmath12 and lg@xmath14 configurations both have a clipping loss of 1ppm at the cavity mirrors , thus the beam size at the mirrors for lg@xmath14 configuration is factor of 1.64 larger than for the lg@xmath12 configuration .",
    "the lg@xmath15 configuration has the same spot size at the mirrors as the lg@xmath12 configuration , but uses a lg@xmath1 beam , and therefore has a lower clipping loss .",
    "the lg@xmath15 configuration is less realistic for comparison with the lg@xmath12 , for the aforementioned reason that advanced detectors will be pushing towards larger beam sizes irrespective of spatial mode used , but we found it useful to include in the study to separate the effects due beam parameters and effects due directly to mode shape .",
    "the first control signal investigated was the longitudinal error signal for a single cavity . for a pound - drever - hall ( pdh )",
    "modulation / demodulation error signal generation technique @xcite , the resulting longitudinal control signal was identical for all three of the considered configurations .",
    "the next step was an analysis of the coupling from end mirror tilt to longitudinal phase noise in a single cavity for each configuration .",
    "figure [ fig : tilttophase ] shows the results of the investigation for a 3 km cavity based on the advanced virgo reference design in @xcite .",
    "the lg@xmath15 configuration performs slightly better than the lg@xmath12 here , but of the two configurations with equal clipping losses , the lg@xmath12 configuration performs significantly better than the lg@xmath14 configuration .",
    "this is because the lg@xmath14 configuration requires the cavity to be pushed closer to the unstable concentric design in order to achieve the necessary beam sizes at the mirrors .        as well as length sensing and control , angular sensing and",
    "control is crucial to maintaining stable operation and maximum sensitivity of a gravitational wave interferometer . to investigate how the lg@xmath12 mode performs in this respect ,",
    "an alignment scheme based on the ward technique described in @xcite was designed for the same 3 km cavities previously described .",
    "the optical layout for this scheme is shown in panel of figure [ fig : alignment ] .",
    "radio frequency sidebands are added to the beam by the electro - optic modulator ( eom ) , and the beam is passed into the cavity via a beam splitter .",
    "the reflected beam from the cavity is split in two , and each resulting beam is passed through a telescope and detected with a quadrant photodetector .",
    "these telescopes are designed such that the gouy phase ( see equation [ eqn : gouyphase ] ) difference between the beams at each quadrant photodetector is 90@xmath16 , in order to provide the maximum possible orthogonality between alignment signals from the end mirror and the input mirror .",
    "the signal from each photodetector is demodulated by mixing with the initial radio frequency , with a demodulation phase chosen such as to maximise the slope of the error signal corresponding to the mirror for which the photodetector is required to sense the alignment . in order to match the conditions under which the alignment control system will be developed in practice as closely as possible ,",
    "we tuned the parameters rather than using the theoretical optimum parameters .        the alignment sensing figure of merit for each configuration can be summarized by its control matrix @xcite .",
    "the elements of these control matrices are the slopes of the error signal at the working point as measured at quadrant photodetectors qpd1 and qpd2 , for misalignments of the cavity input mirror imx , and end mirror emx , as shown in equation [ eqn : config ] .",
    "@xmath17 the resulting control matrices for each of the three cavity configurations were as follows : @xmath18 an ideal control matrix would be diagonal , since the off diagonal elements correspond to the presence of information from the unwanted mirror in a given photodetector signal . in this respect ,",
    "the lg@xmath12 and lg@xmath15 configurations give control matrices which are much closer to the ideal than the lg@xmath14 configuration ; the information from the two mirrors is better separated in these two configurations .",
    "the next aspect of the interferometric performance of the lg@xmath12 mode to be investigated was the coupling of differential arm cavity misalignment to power at the interferometer output port .",
    "if the two arm cavities are differentially misaligned , the overlap of the two beams at the central beam splitter will not be complete , leading to a change in the light power present at the output port of the interferometer , as illustrated in panel of figure [ fig : alignment ] .",
    "if this differential misalignment varies with time , the power measured at the dark port will also vary with time , producing a signal at the photodetector that is indistinguishable from gravitational wave signals .",
    "we obtained values for the output power enhancement due to differential misalignment for each of the three previously described cavity configurations , as shown in figure [ fig : diffmisalign ] .",
    "comparing the simulation results with the reference limit ( around 7@xmath1910@xmath20w ) calculated from a differential arm length requirement of 10@xmath21 m @xcite and a dark fringe offset of 10@xmath22 m @xcite , we see that the lg@xmath15 configuration performs best , but crucially that the lg@xmath12 configuration also outperforms the lg@xmath14 configuration . in summary , for all the interferometric performance aspects analysed",
    ", the lg@xmath12 configuration performs significantly better than the lg@xmath14 configuration .",
    "the lg@xmath15 performs as well or better than the lg@xmath12 configuration , but it should be recalled that this will have a significantly higher thermal noise level , and for this reason is not representative of a likely configuration for advanced detectors .",
    "m for a dark fringe offset of 10@xmath22 m .",
    ", width=340 ]    the final comparison between the performance of the lg@xmath1 and lg@xmath12 modes was in terms of the overall detector sensitivity .",
    "several scenarios for using the lg@xmath12 mode in advanced virgo detector were evaluated in @xcite , but here we just discuss a scenario which compares the sensitivity of the detector with lg@xmath1 and lg@xmath12 modes where both beams experience a 1ppm clipping loss at the cavity mirrors .",
    "the cavity mirror curvatures @xmath23 and beam sizes at the mirrors @xmath5 for the two configurations in this scenario are shown in table [ tab : sensitivity ] . in each case",
    "the detector sensitivity was calculated using a version of gravitational wave interferometer noise calculator ( gwinc ) @xcite especially adapted for advanced virgo .",
    "table [ tab : sensitivity ] shows the results of the calculation for the two cases ns / ns , and bh / bh where the signal recycling detuning ( sr det.)@xcite was optimized for detection of signals from binary neutron star inspirals and binary black hole inspirals respectively . the figures of merit chosen were the effective detection ranges for the two signal sources , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . according to these results",
    ", the lg@xmath12 mode provides a relative improvement of the inspiral ranges by around 20% and 25% for signal recycling detunings of 750hz and 300hz respectively , compared to the lg@xmath1 mode .",
    "this corresponds to a potential increase by up to a factor of 2 in the observable event rate of the advanced virgo detector by using the lg@xmath12 mode instead of the lg@xmath1 mode .",
    "the method and results of the investigation described in this section are presented in more detail in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the analysis showed that the transmitted beam was to 99% in the lg@xmath12 mode for both the helical and sinusoidal cases . with an estimate of the transmitted mode purity , together with measurements of the cavity finesse and throughput efficiency , we were also able to estimate the lg@xmath12 mode content of the input beam to be 66% for the helical beam , and 51% for the sinusoidal beam . a detailed description of the method and results of this experiment can be found in @xcite .",
    "one important difference between higher - order lg modes and the fundamental lg@xmath1 mode is that only the lg@xmath1 mode is unique in its mode order . for each higher - order mode there",
    "exists at least one other mode of the same order .",
    "since the mode filtering effect of optical cavities relies principally on the round trip gouy phase difference between different mode orders , they can not therefore filter out all other modes than the lg@xmath12 when on resonance for order 9 .",
    "for this reason we call the other order 9 modes degenerate with the lg@xmath12 mode",
    ".    this degeneracy of higher - order modes has serious implications for their application in gravitational wave interferometers . in the initial simulations reported in @xcite",
    "the interferometer mirrors were modelled as perfect spherical curved mirrors . in reality",
    "however , the mirrors will have some small deviations from perfect spherical surfaces which can cause coupling from the lg@xmath12 mode into other modes of order 9 .",
    "if we consider this process occurring within the arm cavities of a gravitational wave interferometer , the degeneracy of the modes of order 9 will mean that the mode content of the circulating beam may have a significantly reduced proportion of lg@xmath12 , the remainder being made up principally of other order 9 modes .",
    "if the mode content of both arm cavities is different ( which is likely to be the case if the coupling between modes is driven by the randomly oriented mirror surface distortions ) the modal overlap at the beam splitter will be imperfect and the output port contrast will be reduced .",
    "the method and results of a detailed numerical and analytical investigation into the effect of mirror surface distortions on the purity of lg modes within optical cavities were presented at the 2011 amaldi meeting @xcite , and in @xcite , and another study on this topic is presented in @xcite .",
    "one of the most important outcomes from the work described in @xcite was the derivation of an analytical formula for predicting the amount of coupling between different lg modes upon reflection from a mirror , based on the spatial features of mirror surfaces as described by zernike polynomial functions . in the limit",
    "that the height of the surface distortions is much smaller than the wavelength of the light , coupling between an incident mode lg@xmath26 and a reflected mode lg@xmath27 is only significantly caused by zernike polynomials z@xmath28 which satisfy the condition @xmath29 .",
    "based on this result , it was possible to propose limits on the heights of the most important lower - order zernike polynomial present on mirror surfaces , in order to achieve a circulating mode purity of over 99.9% @xcite .",
    "following the simulation studies and table - top experiments , we continue to pursue experimental tests of lg mode technology .",
    "currently , this involves evaluating the performance of the lg@xmath12 mode in a suspended 10 m cavity at the glasgow prototype facility , and the development of a high - power lg@xmath12 mode laser beam at the hannover high - power laser facility .    procession from table - top experiments to a prototype experiment with suspended mirrors",
    "is a standard feature of the development of new technologies for gravitational wave detectors , in order to ensure compatibility with realistic interferometer subsystems and requirements .",
    "experiments at the glasgow prototype also give us a way to investigate the lg mode degeneracy problem heretofore only looked at theoretically and numerically . though we did not observe the detrimental effects of the mode degeneracy problem in our table - top experiment we believe this is most likely due to the relatively small beam sizes used on the mirrors , and the low cavity finesse in comparison to the advanced detector arm cavities .",
    "however , it is clear that lg modes must also work with larger beam sizes in order to provide the thermal noise benefits that make them attractive in the first place .",
    "lg modes must also be compatible with cavities of similar finesse to the advanced detector arm cavities .",
    "we have therefore been setting up an experiment at the glasgow 10 m prototype facility which uses larger beam sizes in a higher finesse cavity .    the laser mode conversion path on the glasgow 10 m prototype input optics bench .",
    "the red line shows the lg@xmath12 mode path , and the green line shows the lg@xmath1 path that bypasses the phaseplate .",
    "the purple line shows the original lg@xmath1 laser path.,title=\"fig : \" ] the laser mode conversion path on the glasgow 10 m prototype input optics bench .",
    "the red line shows the lg@xmath12 mode path , and the green line shows the lg@xmath1 path that bypasses the phaseplate .",
    "the purple line shows the original lg@xmath1 laser path.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this experiment we will use an etched diffractive optic to facilitate the conversion from lg@xmath1 to lg@xmath12 , similar to that used in @xcite , rather than the slm used in the table - top experiments .",
    "though the slm was very useful for prototyping purposes to investigate the effects of different phase profiles , a fixed transmissive optic allows to generate a higher mode purity with more stability than the slm .",
    "the setup for the lg@xmath12 mode conversion bench is shown in figure [ fig : jiftable ] .",
    "the beam is picked off from the previously used laser path ( shown in purple ) after a fibre output coupler , and directed with a flip mirror into the lg mode conversion area .",
    "the red path shows the lg@xmath12 mode conversion path , in which the beam passes through an eom for generating the control sidebands , and the etched diffractive phaseplate .",
    "the resulting beam is then transmitted through a linear mode cleaner , which is feedback controlled using the pdh method to remain on resonance for mode order 9 .",
    "this serves to increase the mode purity of the beam , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the transmitted beam is then passed back into the previously used laser path using another flip mirror , and on towards the suspended cavity .",
    "the green path is a phaseplate bypass path , which enables us to alternatively operate the linear mode cleaner with the lg@xmath1 mode .",
    "since the light transmitted by the mode cleaner must be defined by the cavity eigenmodes , the transmitted lg@xmath1 and lg@xmath12 beams should have the same alignment and mode matching relative to the suspended cavity .",
    "this enables us to make a valid assessment of the relative performance of the two modes within the suspended cavity .",
    "the experimental work on lg modes at the glasgow prototype is still under way , though we will soon have results about the performance of the lg@xmath12 mode within a cavity of finesse in the region of 600 - around the same finesse foreseen for the advanced detector arm cavities .",
    "we plan to analyse the length control signals for the cavity , as well as the transmitted beam intensity pattern , in order to ascertain the level of coupling between lg modes that occurs in the cavity .",
    "analysis of the circulating mode purity , together with measured data of the cavity mirror surfaces , should enable us to verify the results of the theoretical investigation into the lg mode degeneracy problem described in @xcite . with this information",
    ", we should be in a position to make well informed decisions on the suitability of lg mode technology for future detectors , based on the surface quality of the available optics .",
    "another crucial requirement for lg mode technology to be useful in future detectors is the ability to generate high - power and high - purity lg mode laser beams for the interferometer input .",
    "it is planned to use laser powers in excess of 100w in the advanced detectors in order to bring the shot noise level down , so any prospective lg mode light source must also be able to reach comparable power levels . in collaboration with the members of the aei in hannover that developed the new 200w laser system for advanced ligo @xcite , we are currently setting up an experiment to investigate the technical challenges of generating lg modes at such high powers .",
    "high - power beams from tens to hundreds of watts will be passed through etched diffractive phaseplates .",
    "following the example of our very first experiment on lg modes described in section 3 , the lg beams that are generated will be then filtered by means of a linear mode cleaner , and their subsequent purity analysed .",
    "this work is also still at a preliminary stage , but we expect to be able to report results in the near future .",
    "we have investigated the suitability of higher - order lg mode technology for use in future gravitational wave interferometers for reducing the test mass thermal noise , from many different angles .",
    "an initial simulation study showed that the longitudinal and angular control performance of the lg@xmath12 mode in an advanced virgo - like interferometer was significantly better than the lg@xmath1 mode with the same clipping losses at the cavity mirrors .",
    "it was also shown that increases in the observable event rates of advanced virgo by up to a factor of 2 could be gained by using the lg@xmath12 mode in place of the lg@xmath1 mode .",
    "table - top experiments verified the equivalence of the lg@xmath12 mode and lg@xmath1 mode for pdh longitudinal control signal generation in an optical cavity , and demonstrated the mode cleaning of slm generated lg@xmath12 beams to reach a mode purity of over 99% .",
    "more detailed theoretical investigations into the effects of mirror surface distortions on lg mode purity within optical cavities led to the derivation of an analytical formula for the coupling between lg modes caused by specific mirror distortions . using this formula ,",
    "mirror specifications required for compatibility with the lg@xmath12 mode were subsequently derived .",
    "we are currently engaged in a collaborative effort with the university of glasgow to verify the results of these theoretical investigations , by means of experiment within the 10 m prototype facility in glasgow .",
    "we are also currently investigating the feasibility of generating high - power and high - mode purity lg@xmath12 beams at the hannover high - power laser facility .",
    "higher - order lg modes can potentially offer a significant improvement in the sensitivity of future gravitational wave interferometers : our research program will evaluate how much of that potential is likely to be realisable in practice .",
    "we thank b. barr , a. bell , s. huttner , j. macarthur , b. sorazu and k. strain for providing the opportunity and helping to perform the lg mode experiments at the glasgow 10 m prototype , and we thank c. bogan , p. kwee and b. willke for the same assistance in the high - power lg modes experiment in hannover .",
