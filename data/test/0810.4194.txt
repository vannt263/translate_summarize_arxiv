    "anticipations among high energy physicists for the discovery of new physics at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are very high as it prepares to operate in full swing .",
    "there are a number of compelling rationales for anticipating new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of them is the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , which indicates the survival of more matter than antimater during the evolution of the universe . in the sm ,",
    "the only source of cp violation is the complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "it has been noticed that the size of cp violation in the sm by means of the ckm matrix alone is too small to explain the observed value of the baryon - to - entropy ratio , @xmath2 [ 1 ] , if the universe had begun from a baryon - symmetric state .",
    "thus , in order to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , other sources of adequate cp violation are required .",
    "a number of alternative models beyond the sm have been investigated for the possibility of cp violations .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has been with us for several decades , which nowadays is regarded as the most certain candidate for new physics . in reality , the necessity of cp violation beyond the sm is not the only _ raison detre _ for the susy .",
    "there are multiples of arguments that support its existence in nature .",
    "some supersymmetric models have also been studied in this context , as their sophisticated higgs sectors may possess sources of cp violation [ 2 ] . for some phenomenologically realistic supersymmetric models extended from the sm , soft susy",
    "breaking terms are essential ingredients [ 3 ] .",
    "if these soft susy breaking terms contain complex phases , the phenomenological analyses of these supersymmetric standard models might not only be complicated but also involve cp violation .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the simplest version of supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "its higgs sector has two higgs doublets in order to give masses to up - like quarks and down - like quarks separately . at the one - loop level",
    ", a complex phase in the soft susy breaking terms of the mssm induces an explicit cp mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons [ 4 ] .",
    "non - minimal versions of supersymmetric extension of the sm have additional higgs singlets and thus can dynamically solve the dimensional @xmath3-parameter problem in the mssm by means of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs singlet [ 5,6,7 ] .",
    "they have also been studied within the context of explicit cp violation in their higgs sectors [ 8,9,10,11 ] .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) is a typical member of them . unlike the mssm",
    ", the higgs potential of the nmssm has one nontrivial cp phase after redefining the higgs fields at the tree level [ 9 ] . at the one - loop level",
    ", it also develops cp violating phases .",
    "the effects of explicit cp violation at the one - loop level in the nmssm on the masses of neutral and charged higgs bosons are predicted in the literature [ 10 ] .",
    "the higgs potentials of both the minimal non - minimal supersymmetric model and the @xmath4-extended supersymmetric model may not have any cp phase at the tree level [ 11 ] .",
    "however , these models may also possess complex phases to induce explicit cp violation at the one - loop level , by taking the radiative corrections due to the quark and squark loops into account .    in this article",
    ", we would like to continue to study the possibility of cp violation in the higgs sector of a supersymmetric @xmath0 model .",
    "this model has two @xmath4 symmetries in addition to the sm gauge symmetry , thus with two additional neutral gauge bosons , and two higgs singlets as well as two higgs doublets [ 12,13 ] .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of this model may not have complex phase , because any complex phase can always be eliminated by rotating the relevant higgs fields . at the one - loop level",
    ", it is shown that this model may allow cp violation in an explicit way due to radiative corrections .",
    "we study the higgs phenomenology of this model by varying all the relevant parameters within reasonable ranges , to obtain the upper bound on the lightest neutral higgs boson mass .",
    "we investigate prospects for discovering the neutral higgs bosons of this model at the lhc , by calculating the minimum cross section for producing at least any one of the neutral higgs bosons of this model via the @xmath1 fusion process at the lhc .",
    "let us describe the higgs sector of our model .",
    "we assume that the electroweak gauge symmetry of our model is @xmath5 , where the two extra @xmath4 symmetries are decomposed from @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it is a kind of rank-6 supersymmetric model .",
    "we assume that in general @xmath6 and @xmath7 would mix with a certain mixing angle @xmath8 to become two linearly orthogonal combinations , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the higgs sector of our model consists of two higgs doublets , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and two neutral higgs singlets , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the yukawa interaction between higgs superfields and quark superfields in the superpotential of our model may be expressed as [ 12,13 ] @xmath15 where we take only the third generation into account and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the dimensionless yukawa coupling coefficients of top and bottom quarks , @xmath18 is a dimensionless coefficient , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the higgs doublet superfields , @xmath21 is the higgs singlet superfield , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the right - handed top and bottom quark superfields , and @xmath24 is the left - handed @xmath25 doublet quark superfield of the third generation .",

    "[ 14 ] , where relatively well - known rank-6 susy models are investigated .",

    "these four soft masses in the higgs potential would eventually be eliminated by means of the minimum conditions for the higgs potential with respect to four neutral higgs fields .",
    "the parameters of the higgs potential are assumed to be generally complex .",
    "thus , @xmath18 and @xmath33 in the tree - level higgs potential may be complex such that their complex phases may be factored out explicitly as @xmath38 .",
    "we also assume that the vevs , which four neutral components of the higgs fields acquire after electroweak symmetry breaking , may in general be complex .",
    "however , by redefining the phases of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath14 , we may adjust the vacuum expectation values as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are real and the complex phase @xmath49 is the overall phase in @xmath50 . thus , looking at the higgs potential at the tree level , one can easily notice that the only possible source of complex phases is @xmath51 . by further redefining the phase of the higgs singlet @xmath13",

    "note that @xmath64 is the effect of the two extra @xmath4 symmetries , but it does not contribute the mass splitting between the two stop quark masses .",
    "the mixing , and hence the mass splitting , between the stop quark masses is triggered by @xmath65 .",
    "now let us consider the one - loop radiative corrections to the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "in supersymmetric models , the incomplete cancellation between ordinary particles and their superpartners yield the one - loop corrections to the tree - level higgs boson masses . in susy models ,",
    "the most dominant part of the one - loop corrections to the tree - level higgs potential come primarily from the top and stop quark loops . for large @xmath66 as large as 50 , the contribution of the bottom and sbottom quark loops can also be large . in this paper",
    ", we consider the contributions from the top and stop quark loops at the one - loop level .",
    "the full higgs potential at the one - loop level may be written as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is contribution from the radiative corrections due to the top and stop quark loops .",

    "unlike the tree - level case , we can not redefine the phase of @xmath13 at the one - loop level to cancel it .",
    "thus , @xmath52 may persist at the one - loop level .",
    "this can be most clearly be seen in the non - trivial tadpole minimum condition with respect to the pseudoscalar component of the higgs field : @xmath81 where the first term comes from the tree - level higgs potential and the second term comes from the radiative corrections , and the dimensionless function @xmath82 arising from radiative corrections is defined as @xmath83 + 1 \\ .\\ ] ] but for the radiative corrections , the above tadpole minimum condition at the tree level would be satisfied when @xmath84 . due to the presence of the one - loop corrections , @xmath85 is no longer in general the solution to the above tadpole minimum condition .",
    "our model has twelve real degrees of freedom in the higgs sector .",

    "they may be expressed as @xmath101 @xmath102 explicitly , the matrix elements of @xmath99 and @xmath97 are respectively given as follows : @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 stands for the splitting between an extra @xmath4 symmetry breaking scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "note that both @xmath99 and @xmath106 do not mix @xmath92 with @xmath94 . in other words , there is no scalar - psuedoscalar mixing at the tree - level , hence the cp symmetry .",
    "it is straightforward to recognize that the single element @xmath107 is the squared mass at the tree level of the neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
    "note also that if the two extra @xmath4 symmetries are absent , we would have @xmath108 . in this case ,",
    "one of the neutral scalar higgs bosons would be massless at the tree level , since @xmath99 may be decomposed into a block diagram consisting of three blocks , namely , @xmath109 submatrix , @xmath110 and @xmath107 .",
    "now , at the one - loop level , the squared mass matrix @xmath90 of the five neutral higgs bosons is corrected as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the radiative corrections obtained from @xmath113 as @xmath114 explicitly , the matrix elements of @xmath112 are given as follows , after imposing tadpole minimum conditions : @xmath115 where @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 and the dimensionless function @xmath119 is defined as @xmath120    note first that the matrix elements @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) are proportional to @xmath123 . if @xmath124 , these elements would be zero , and the scalar - psuedoscalar mixing at the one - loop level would not occur in the higgs sector .",
    "therefore , there would be no cp violation in the higgs sector at the one - loop level .",
    "the squared mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson at the one - loop level , @xmath125 , would be given simply by the @xmath126-th element of the @xmath90 , taking @xmath127 .",
    "it is given by adding the radiative corrections as @xmath128 in this case , the @xmath26-terms of extra @xmath4 symmetries would not contribute to the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson either at the tree level or at the one - loop level .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath129 , there would be cp violation at the one - loop level , the cp phase in the radiative corrections generates the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing , thus the five neutral higgs bosons are no longer states of definite cp parity . in this case",
    ", the mass matrix should be diagonalized to obtain mass eigenstates @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) whose squared masses @xmath132 ( @xmath131 ) are the eigenvalues of the mass matrix .",
    "these five neutral higgs bosons are usually numbered such that @xmath133 is the lightest neutral higgs boson and @xmath134 is the heaviest .",
    "hereafter , we work in the explicit cp violation scenario , that is , with @xmath129 .    in our model , the squared masses of the two extra gauge bosons @xmath135 and @xmath136 are obtained as the eigenvalues of the mass matrix for them .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath135 and @xmath136 are given as @xmath137 where @xmath138 the two mixing angles in our model , @xmath139 between @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath140 between @xmath86 and @xmath88 , are expressed as @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we take @xmath143 in our numerical analysis , motivated by the gauge coupling unification .",
    "we consider the region of the parameter space bounded as @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "we assume that the lighter stop quark is heavier than the top quark .",
    "we also assume that all of the relevant mass parameters , @xmath148 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath62 , vary within the range of 100 to 1000 gev . note",
    "that we employ the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson at the one - loop level in the cp conserving scenario , @xmath148 , instead of @xmath33 as an input parameter .",
    "further , we use a combined constraint of @xmath149 gev , as the experimental data on the chargino system set the lower bound on the effective @xmath3 parameter , @xmath150 . for the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ", we would set their ranges not by hand but by experimental constraints .",
    "there are strong experimental constraints on the mass of the extra neutral gauge boson and the mixing between @xmath86 in the sm and the extra neutral gauge boson .",
    "thus , any model with extra neutral gauge bosons , such as our model , should comply with these constraints , whose exact values may dependent on the specific structures of the models .",
    "we would like to take in this article that the mixing angles , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , should be smaller than @xmath151 and the masses of the two extra gauge bosons , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , should be larger than 800 gev .    the experimental constraints on the higgs sector should also be taken into account in the numerical analysis .",
    "the latest experimental analyses tell that the sm higgs boson lighter than 114.5 gev is excluded at the 95 % confidence level .",
    "this lower bound on the sm higgs boson mass may be applied to our model by considering the relevant higgs couplings .",
    "recently , the lep collaborations reported the model - independent upper bound on @xmath152 at the 95 % confidence level [ 16 ] .",
    "first , we determine the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , varying the values of other relevant parameters within their allowed ranges .",
    "while the values of the above parameters are chosen by the random number generation method within their respective ranges , the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined in terms of the other parameters by imposing experimental constraints .",
    "the result is shown in fig.1(a ) , where a distribution of 7125 points is displayed in the ( @xmath47,@xmath48)-plane .",
    "these points are selected among @xmath153 random points as they satisfy all of the above experimental constraints .",
    "each point represents a set of parameter values , of which the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are explicit while others are implicit .",
    "it is notable that these selected points are distributed in the area of the ( @xmath47,@xmath48)-plane where @xmath154 gev .",
    "some points are scattered at @xmath155 gev .",
    "then , we calculate for each point in fig.1(a ) the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson in our model . in this way , it is clear that the results are consistent with the relevant parameter ranges as well as the experimental constraints .",
    "the result is shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the majority of the points are scattered within the range of @xmath156 gev , while a few of them are distributed where @xmath157 is as low as 30 gev .",
    "the result of fig.1(b ) suggests that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson in our model is most probably about 130 gev at the one - loop level .",
    "one may notice some pattern in fig.1(b ) .",
    "we find that this pattern comes from the experimental constraints on the extra gauge bosons rather than that the experimental bound on the sm higgs boson mass .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath158 is found to arise from the experimental constraints on the masses of the extra neutral gauge bosons .",
    "meanwhile , most of points with @xmath159 gev are excluded by the experimental constraints on the sm higgs boson mass .",
    "we also calculate the masses of other neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) , where we display the correlation between @xmath160 and @xmath161 in fig .",
    "1(c ) and the correlation between @xmath162 and @xmath163 in fig .",
    "the points in these figures are obtained with the same parameter values as in figs .",
    "1(a ) or ( b ) . note the clear hierarchy between the masses of the neutral higgs bosons such that @xmath164 in fig .",
    "1(c ) and @xmath165 in fig .",
    "the ranges for the masses of heavier neutral higgs bosons in our model , estimated using the aforementioned parameter values , are : @xmath166 gev , @xmath167 gev , @xmath168 gev , and @xmath169 gev , where the upper bounds come from theoretical arguments and the lower bounds come from phenomenological constraints .",
    "now , we examine the possibility of discovering one of the neutral higgs bosons in our model in the @xmath170 collisions at the lhc , where the most dominant process for the higgs production is the gluon fusion process , with thick qcd backgrounds . the @xmath1 fusion process is considered as the next dominant process for the higgs production , which is relatively cleaner than the gluon fusion process .",
    "we would like to focus on the @xmath1 fusion process .",
    "we find that the pythia program is useful for calculating the higgs production mechanism than for other processes , although it has not yet been applied to the cp violation scenario in the mssm higgs sector .",
    "however , the production cross section of the neutral higgs bosons in our model with explicit cp violation via the @xmath1 fusion process in @xmath170 collisions is obtained by using the pythia 6.4 program after appropriately modifying the relevant higgs coupling coefficients [ 17 ] .",
    "more precisely , we normalize @xmath171 , the @xmath172 coupling coefficient of the higgs coupling to a pair of @xmath89 bosons , by the corresponding sm higgs coupling coefficient .",
    "we have @xmath173 where @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) are the elements of the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix for the five neutral higgs bosons .    technically , we set the number of events to generate for each point as nev = 2000 .",
    "the higgs coupling coefficient is set by mstp(4)=1 , and the normalized higgs coupling to a @xmath89 boson pair is set by paru(165 ) = @xmath176 . the factorization scale and the renormalization scale",
    "are taken to be the neutral higgs boson mass , that is , parp(193 ) = pmas(25,1 ) and parp(194)= pmas(25,1 ) .",
    "the pdf library of the cteq5l is used in our program , mstp(51)=7 , which is the default parton distribution function set for the proton in pythia 6.4 .",
    "we use mstp(33)=0 to include the @xmath177 factor in hard cross sections for parton interactions in pythia 6.4 by default .",
    "the @xmath1 fusion process for the lightest neutral higgs boson is set by msub(124 ) = 1 .    in this way",
    ", we obtain all of @xmath178 ( @xmath131 ) , the production cross sections of @xmath130 in our model with explicit cp violation via the @xmath1 fusion process in @xmath170 collisions .",
    "they are given as functions of the participating neutral higgs boson masses .",
    "among the five production cross sections , we select the largest one , as we are interested in discovering any one of the five neutral higgs bosons .",
    "thus , we introduce @xmath179    we show our result in fig .",
    "2 , where we plot @xmath180 against @xmath157 .",
    "the parameter values for each point are the same as in fig.1(a ) or fig.1(b ) .",
    "we find that the smallest value for @xmath180 is about 1 pb .",
    "this implies that at least one of the five neutral higgs bosons in our model may be produced with its cross section larger than 1 pb . the accumulated integrated luminosity of @xmath181 fb at the lhc would yield 6000 raw higgs events , if we allow 20 % for the efficiency and acceptance .",
    "therefore , we expect with relatively strong confidence that at least one of the five neutral higgs bosons in our model might be produced via the @xmath1 fusion process at the lhc , if they exist .    here , the roles that the exotic quarks take part in are worth mentioning with respect to the higgs phenomenology of our model .",
    "the exotic quarks may inhabit the fundamental 27 representation of @xmath0 , which is the underlying gauge symmetry of our model . in the fundamental 27 representation ,",
    "15 components are occupied by the sm matter fields , 4 components by the two higgs doublets , 2 components by the higgs singlet , and the remaining 6 components are occupied by the exotic quarks [ 12 - 14,18 - 20 ] .",
    "the form of the superpotential tells us that the exotic quarks may couple to various higgs fields .",
    "they couple directly to the neutral component of the higgs singlet @xmath13 and indirectly , through the mixing among the neutral higgs bosons via the diagonalization matrix , to other neutral higgs fields .",
    "if the masses of the exotic quarks are comparable to the electroweak symmetry breaking or susy breaking scales , the low energy susy phenomenology might be affected by their presence .",
    "the effects of the exotic quarks might appear in the gluon fusion processes for higgs productions , as well as in the higgs decay processes .",
    "in particular , for example , the higgs decays into a pair of gluons or photons might receive the effects of the exotic quarks , when the mass of the higgs boson is below the range where the decay channel into a pair of gauge bosons are not yet open .    however , it is somewhat difficult to predict the amount of the exotic quark effects because it depends on the relevant parameters in a complicated way .",
    "the coupling strength of the exotic quarks to the neutral higgs bosons are weak in general but might be strong , depending on what is the explicit structure of the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix for the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "therefore , it would be valuable to study elsewhere a comprehensive research on the effects of the exotic quarks in our model .",
    "we study a supersymmetric @xmath0 model with two extra @xmath4 symmetries besides the sm gauge symmetry , and two neutral higgs singlets besides two mssm higgs doublets .",
    "we find that the higgs sector of our model may generally accommodate a non - trivial complex phase which can cause the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing among the five neutral higgs bosons , by virtue of radiative corrections due to the top and stop quark loops .",
    "thus , explicit cp violation at the one - loop level is viable in our model .",
    "numerical analysis shows that there are parameter regions in our model which comply with a number of experimental constraints such as the lower bound on the extra neutral gauge boson masses and the upper bound on the mixing between the extra neutral gauge bosons and the sm neutral gauge boson . within the allowed parameter regions",
    ", we study the behavior of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs singlets , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we find that they can not be simultaneously small .",
    "the experimental constraints on the extra neutral gauge bosons restrict that @xmath158 should be larger than 2100 gev whereas either one of them may be as small as 400 gev .",
    "the possibility of discovering one of the five neutral higgs bosons in our model is examined by calculating the production cross sections using the pythia 6.4 program , where the relevant higgs couplings are modified suitably .",
    "we focus the @xmath1 fusion process at the lhc for their productions .",
    "we find that at least one of five neutral higgs bosons can be produced enough via the @xmath1 fusion process at the lhc .",
    "thus , we speculate that the present susy @xmath0 model can be tested by the higgs searches at the lhc .",
