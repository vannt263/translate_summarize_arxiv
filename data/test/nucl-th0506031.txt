    "the determination of the binding energy of nuclei starting from realistic @xmath1 potentials is one of the subjects which has received permanent attention from the early days when the brueckner - bethe - goldstone ( bbg ) equation introduced methods to overcome the strong repulsion of the nuclear forces at short distances .    at present , several many body techniques compete to accurately determine the binding energy of nuclear matter starting from the realistic nn potentials .",
    "one of them is the correlated basis functions ( cbf ) @xcite , which follows the line of the hypernetted chain approach ( fhnc ) @xcite .",
    "another one follows the traditional bbg approach @xcite , and , although costly numerically , the variational monte carlo method ( mc ) has allowed to make , in principle , exact calculations , although limited to nuclei with small or medium value of a @xcite .",
    "methods like the selfconsistent treatment of the nucleon selfenergy have also introduced new advances in the field @xcite .",
    "the need for three body forces has also been emphasized and the present status is that it is difficult to be quantitative on the strength of these forces , and usually they are parameterized in order to adjust the precise value of the binding energy @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted in @xcite that short range correlations play an important role when considering these three body forces .",
    "a common feature of these approaches is that they start from the realistic nucleon nucleon interaction , obtained from fits to nn data and deuteron data .",
    "they use hence the free nn interaction as input .",
    "one of the important ingredients of this interaction is the one pion exchange ( ope ) .",
    "however , from detailed studies of the pion nuclear interaction it is well known that the pion properties in the nuclear medium are sizably renormalized @xcite .",
    "there is also the question of the intermediate range attraction , which is basic in the binding of nuclei .",
    "models for this interaction would contain @xmath0 exchange , uncorrelated two pion exchange and omega exchange @xcite . in as much as the pion properties are changed in the medium , so should the two pion exchange be modified .",
    "medium effects in the two - pion exchange have been investigated in early works like in ref .",
    "@xcite restricting themselves in this case to a subset of two pion exchange diagrams with no @xmath3-isobar intermediate states , by including pauli blocking in the intermediate nucleons",
    ".    the medium modification of the two pion exchange got a new impulse after the models of the @xmath4 interaction in the medium showed large modifications @xcite , later on softened by the introduction of chiral constraints  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of this medium modified @xmath4 interaction in the correlated two pion exchange @xmath1 potential increased appreciably the @xmath1 attraction in nuclear matter .",
    "this was partially reduced by the consideration of the chiral constraints in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these latter references",
    "the importance of short range correlations which modify the @xmath5 nucleus selfenergy was already discussed .",
    "the further use of medium modified vector meson masses led to improvements in the nuclear matter saturation curve .",
    "a new perspective into this problem has been made possible by studies of meson meson interaction within chiral unitary approaches  @xcite which allow to improve the description of the correlated two pion exchange @xmath1 interaction  @xcite , as an alternative to the conventional @xmath0-meson exchange interaction .",
    "this picture of the @xmath0 exchange was mandatory after extensive studies showing that the @xmath0 is not a genuine resonance , made up of @xmath6 but just the manifestation of a pion - pion resonance state created by the interaction of the pions , what is called a dynamically generated resonance .",
    "this shows up naturally within the context of chiral unitary approaches which use the input of the chiral lagrangians for the meson meson interaction and extends chiral perturbation theory to implement exactly unitarity in coupled channels @xcite .",
    "this means the @xmath0 exchange inside a nuclear medium will also be modified as direct consequence of the change of the pion properties .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to start from this new picture for the @xmath0 exchange , use also the standard approach for the uncorrelated two pion exchange and modify these in the nuclear medium to see what changes one finds from these sources .",
    "further improvements come from the consideration of short range correlations not only in the pion selfenergy but also in the vertex functions appearing in the model .",
    "the changes obtained are moderate , thanks to the simultaneous consideration of these nuclear short range effects in the calculation . in the absence of these",
    ", the renormalization of the @xmath1 interaction is huge . yet , even the moderate results obtained are large enough to motivate further calculations of the nuclear binding and other properties of matter .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> the corrections obtained for the @xmath1 interaction in the medium in this channel are of the order of 20@xmath2 of the free one in average , and the consideration of short range correlations plays an important role in providing these moderate changes . yet , the corrections are sizable enough to suggest further studies of the stability and properties of nuclear matter . </S>"
