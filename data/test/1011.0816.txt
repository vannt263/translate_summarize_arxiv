    "knowledge of the distribution of cosmic - ray ( cr ) densities within our galaxy is a key to understanding their origin and propagation .",
    "high - energy crs interact with the gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) or the interstellar radiation field , and produce @xmath0-rays via nucleon - nucleon interactions , electron bremsstrahlung and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "since the ism is transparent to these @xmath0-rays , we can probe crs in the local ism , beyond direct measurements performed in the solar system , as well as in remote locations of the galaxy .",
    "although much effort has been made since the cos - b era ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results have been limited by the angular resolution , effective area and energy coverage of the instruments .",
    "the advent of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope enables studying the spectral and spatial distribution of diffuse @xmath0-rays and crs with unprecedented sensitivity .    here",
    "we report an analysis of diffuse @xmath0-ray emission observed in the third galactic quadrant .",
    "the window with galactic longitude @xmath5 and latitude @xmath6 hosts kinematically well - defined segments of the local and the perseus spiral arms and is one of the best regions to study the cr density distribution across the outer galaxy .",
    "the region has been already studied by @xcite using egret data . the improved sensitivity and angular resolution of the _ fermi _ lat ( large area telescope ; * ? ? ? * ) and recent developments in the study of the ism allow us to examine the cr spectra and density distribution with better accuracy .",
    "we exclude from the analysis the region of the monoceros r2 giant molecular cloud and the southern filament of the orion - monoceros complex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , because 1 ) star forming activity and possible high magnetic fields suggested by the filamentary structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) could indicate a special cr environment , and 2 ) an ob association in monoceros r2 may hamper the determination of ism densities from dust tracers ( see   2.1.2 for details ) .",
    "study of the @xmath9 conversion factor which transforms the integrated intensity of the 2.6  mm line of carbon monoxide , @xmath10 , into the molecular hydrogen column density , @xmath11 , is also possible since the region contains well - known molecular complexes . in the local arm",
    "we find the molecular clouds associated with canis major ob  1 , ngc  2348 and ngc  2632 @xcite . at a few kpc from the solar system , in the interarm , lower - density region located between the local and perseus arms , we find maddalena s cloud @xcite , a giant molecular cloud remarkable for its lack of star formation , and the cloud associated with canis major ob  2 @xcite .",
    "this study complements the _ fermi _ lat study of the cassiopeia and cepheus region in the second quadrant reported by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the model preparation in   2 and the @xmath0-ray observations , data selection and the analysis procedure in   3 .",
    "the results are presented in   4 , where we also discuss the emissivity profile measured for the atomic gas and we compare it with predictions by a cr propagation model .",
    "a summary of the study is given in ",
    "in order to derive the @xmath0-ray emissivities associated with the different components of the ism we need to determine the interstellar gas column densities separately for each region and gas phase . for atomic hydrogen we used the leiden / argentine / bonn galactic h  survey by @xcite .",
    "in order to turn the h  line intensities into @xmath12(h ) column densities , a uniform spin temperature @xmath13 has often been adopted in previous studies .",
    "we will consider this option to directly compare our results with the former egret analysis of the same region @xcite and other studies of the galactic diffuse emission by the lat @xcite .",
    "recent h  absorption studies @xcite , however , point to larger average spin temperatures in the outer galaxy , so we have tried different choices of @xmath14 to evaluate how the optical depth correction affects the results",
    ". we will find that the emissivity per h  atom and the inferred cr density is affected by up to @xmath15  50% in the perseus arm , and will take this uncertainty into account in the discussion .",
    "the integrated intensities of the 2.6  mm line of co , @xmath10 , have been derived from the composite survey by @xcite .",
    "the data have been filtered with the moment - masking technique in order to reduce the noise while keeping the resolution of the original data .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows the velocity - longitude profile of h  emission in our region of interest ( roi ) .",
    "the preparation of maps accounting for the different galactic structures present along the line of sight is similar to that described in detail in @xcite and based on a sequence of three steps :    1 .",
    "preliminary separation within galactocentric rings ; 2 .",
    "adjustment of the boundaries based on the velocity structures of the interstellar complexes ; 3 .",
    "correction for the spill - over due to the velocity dispersion of the broad h  lines between adjacent regions .",
    "four regions were defined in galactocentric distance , namely the local arm ( galactocentric radius @xmath16 ) , the interarm region ( @xmath17 ) , the perseus arm ( @xmath18 ) and the region beyond the perseus arm ( which hosts a faint segment of the outer arm ; @xmath19 ) . the boundaries separating these regions under the assumption of a flat rotation curve @xcite for the case of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the galactocentric radius and the orbital velocity of the local group of stars , respectively ) are overlaid in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .    the preparation of the h  and co gas maps started from these preliminary velocity boundaries , which were then adjusted for each line of sight to the closest minimum in the h  spectrum .",
    "then , the spill - over from one velocity interval to the next ones due to the velocity dispersion for the broad h  lines was corrected by fitting each h  spectrum with a combination of gaussian profiles .",
    "we believe that this separation procedure provides more accurate estimates of the ism column densities of each galactic region than a simple slicing based on the rotation curve .    in particular , effort was put into separating the outer arm structures from the more massive perseus arm component , especially at @xmath24 where the h  lines from the two regions merge into a single broad component . for directions where a minimum in the h  brightness temperature profile was not found near the @xmath25 kpc velocity boundary , we integrated the profiles on both sides of the @xmath25 kpc velocity boundary to estimate the perseus and outer arm contributions .",
    "then we inserted a line in the gaussian fitting at the outer - arm velocity extrapolated from the @xmath26 trend observed at @xmath24 to correct for the spill - over due to the velocity dispersion .",
    "given these difficulties we expect large systematic uncertainties in the outer - arm @xmath12(h ) column densities and the corresponding @xmath0-ray emissivities will not be considered for the scientific interpretation .",
    "we note that the impact on the emissivities associated with the inner regions is small , @xmath27% as described in ",
    "[ sec : crgradient ] .",
    "the resulting maps are shown in figure  [ fig : hi ] and [ fig : co ] .",
    "they exhibit a low level of spatial degeneracy , and thus allow us to separate the @xmath0-radiation arising from the interaction with crs in each component .",
    "it has been long debated whether the combination of h  and co surveys traces total column densities of neutral interstellar matter . by comparing gas line surveys , the @xmath0-ray observations by egret and dust thermal emission",
    ", @xcite reported a considerable amount of neutral gas at the interface between the two h  and co emitting phases , associated with cold dust but not properly traced by h  and co observations .",
    "their finding was then confirmed by lat data for the gould belt in the second quadrant @xcite . in order to complement the h  and co maps ,",
    "we have prepared a map derived from the @xmath28 reddening map by @xcite .",
    "the residual point sources at low latitudes were masked by setting to zero regions of @xmath29 radius centered on the positions of potential iras point sources if the @xmath28 magnitude exceeded by @xmath30% that in surrounding pixels .",
    "the masked regions were then restored through an inpainting technique @xcite .",
    "in the course of the work , various source masking techniques have been used with negligible impact on the h  and co emissivity results .",
    "the resulting map was fitted with a linear combination of the set of @xmath12(h ) and @xmath10 maps described in ",
    "the operation was repeated for different choices of h  spin temperature .",
    "the fit was performed over the same region as for the @xmath0-ray analysis , excluding a @xmath31 region centered around canis major ob  1 @xcite where the temperature correction applied by @xcite to construct the @xmath28 map from the dust thermal emission is highly uncertain .",
    "a preliminary fit had led to extremely negative residuals ( @xmath32 mag ) around @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the residual @xmath28 map was calculated masking this region in the fit .",
    "we are aware that the temperature corrections used by @xcite are less reliable with decreasing latitude , but the improvement we find in the @xmath0-ray fit by adding the dust residual map supports the use of their map at low latitude .",
    "the residual @xmath35 map , after subtracting the linear combination of @xmath12(h ) and @xmath10 maps , is shown in figure  [ fig : ebv ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the residuals typically range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 magnitude .",
    "large regions of positive residuals are found along the galactic plane , in association with molecular / atomic clouds .",
    "they are expected to trace gas not correctly traced by h  and co surveys .",
    "a remarkable region of positive residuals is detected at intermediate latitudes around @xmath38 , @xmath39 , in a region not covered by co surveys .",
    "it corresponds to positive residuals also in @xmath0-rays (   [ sec : procedure ] ) and may be due to a missing , but possibly co - bright molecular cloud ( already suggested by @xcite discussing the completeness of their survey , see figure  8 of their paper ) .",
    "the negative residuals are generally small and may result from limitations in the gas column density derivation and/or dust spectral variations .",
    "the dust residual map compares well with the @xmath0-ray residual map obtained when using only h  and co to model the @xmath0-ray emission ( figure  [ fig : ebv ] , right panel ) .",
    "the correlation between the spatial distributions of the dust and @xmath0-ray residuals is statistically confirmed in ",
    "[ sec : procedure ] .",
    "dust and @xmath0-rays are consistent with the presence of missing gas in the positive residual clumps .",
    "the faint `` glow '' of negative residuals on both sides of the galactic plane is driven by the nearby @xmath12(h ) maps and it remains even when using the smallest possible column - densities derived in the optically thin case .",
    "it may suggest a small change in average spin temperature from the massive , compact clouds sampled in the plane to the more diffuse envelopes sampled off the plane , or it may be due to the presence of more missing gas in the plane than our templates can provide for in the fit . the dust - to - gas ratio as well as the @xmath0-ray emissivity in the h  components",
    "would then be driven to higher values by the low latitude data and would slightly overpredict the data off the plane .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath35 map in this region of the sky is complicated by the lack of distance information for the dust emission .",
    "it is not possible to unambiguously assign the residuals to any of the regions under study .",
    "since we aim at separating different regions along the lines of sight to investigate the cr density gradient in the outer galaxy , using the h  and co lines is essential .",
    "we have therefore used the @xmath35 map to correct for the total gas column densities . this approach is supported by the correlation we find between the dust and @xmath0-ray data (   [ sec : procedure ] ) .",
    "we also note that , since the dust contribution linearly correlated with the h  and co maps has been removed in the @xmath35 map , this procedure allows us to extract the @xmath0-ray emissivities that are actually correlated with the h  and co components .",
    "to model @xmath0-ray emission not related with interstellar gas , we referred to the galprop code ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath0-rays produced through ic scattering and to the first _ fermi _ lat catalog ( 1fgl ) for point sources @xcite .",
    "galprop @xcite is a numerical code which solves the cr transport equation within the galaxy and predicts the @xmath0-ray emission produced via interactions of crs with interstellar matter ( nucleon - nucleon interaction and electron bremsstrahlung ) and low - energy photons ( ic scattering ) .",
    "ic emission is calculated from the distribution of ( propagated ) electrons and the interstellar radiation fields developed by @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the ic model map produced in the galprop run 54_77xvarh7s in which the cr electron spectrum is adjusted to agree with that measured by the lat @xcite .",
    "this galprop model has been used in publications by the lat collaboration such as @xcite .",
    "the 1fgl catalog is based on the first 11 months of the science phase of the mission and contains 1451 sources detected at a significance @xmath40 ( the threshold is 25 in term of test statistic , ts ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the maximum likelihood with and without including the source in the model , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is conventionally calculated as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the data and the model - predicted counts in each pixel denoted by the subscript @xmath46 , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ts is expected to be distributed as a @xmath47 with @xmath48 degrees of freedom if the numbers of free parameters in the model are respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( 4 for sources in the 1fgl catalog ) . ] ) . for our analysis",
    "we considered 21 point sources in the roi with ts larger than 50 .      following a well - established approach that dates back to the cos - b era ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we modeled the @xmath0-ray emission as a linear combination of maps tracing the column density of the interstellar medium .",
    "this approach is based on a simple , but very plausible assumption : @xmath0-rays are generated through interactions of crs and the interstellar gas , and the ism itself is transparent to @xmath0-rays .",
    "then , assuming that cr densities do not significantly vary over the scale of the interstellar complexes under study and that crs penetrate clouds uniformly to their cores we can model the @xmath0-ray intensities to first order as a linear combination of contributions from cr interactions with the different gas phases in the various regions along each line of sight .",
    "we also added the ic model map by galprop and models for point sources taken from the 1fgl catalog as described in   2.2 . to represent the extragalactic diffuse emission and the residual instrumental background from misclassified cr interactions in the lat detector",
    ", we also added an isotropic component .",
    "cr interactions with ionized gas are not explicitly included in the model .",
    "the mass column densities of ionized gas are poorly known , but their contribution is generally lower ( @xmath51 ) than that of the neutral gas and its scale height is much larger ( @xmath52  kpc compared with @xmath53 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore expect the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission originating from ionized gas to be largely accommodated in the fit by other components with large angular scales , such as the isotropic and ic ones , and to minimally impact the determination of the neutral gas emissivities .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-ray intensities @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) can be modeled as :    @xmath56 where sum over @xmath46 represents the combination of the galactic regions , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are the emissivities per h  atom and per @xmath10 unit , respectively .",
    "@xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the emissivity per unit of the @xmath35 map ( for which independent normalizations are allowed between the positive and negative residuals ; see   [ sec : procedure ] ) . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the ic model and isotropic background intensities ( @xmath65 ) , respectively , and @xmath66 represents the point source contributions .",
    "compared to the egret study by @xcite , we use two additional maps to better trace the ism : the co map in the perseus arm and the @xmath35 map .",
    "the lat on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , launched on 2008 june 11 , is a pair - tracking telescope , detecting photons from @xmath67  mev to more than 300  gev .",
    "details on the lat instrument and pre - launch expectations of the performance can be found in @xcite , and the on - orbit calibration is described in @xcite .",
    "routine science operations with the lat started on 2008 august 4 .",
    "we have accumulated events from 2008 august 4 to 2010 february 4 to study diffuse @xmath0-rays in our roi . during this time interval",
    "the lat was operated in sky survey mode nearly all of the time , obtaining complete sky coverage every two orbits and relatively uniform exposures over time .",
    "we used the standard lat analysis software , the _ science tools _ and selected events satisfying the standard low - background event selection ( the so - called _ diffuse _ class ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also required the reconstructed zenith angles of the arrival direction of photons to be less than @xmath68 and the center of the lat field of view to be within @xmath69 from the zenith , in order to reduce the contamination of photons from the earth limb .",
    "in addition , we excluded the period of time during which the lat detected bright grbs , i.e. , grb080916c @xcite , grb090510 @xcite , grb090902b @xcite , and grb090926a @xcite .",
    "the model described by equation  ( 1 ) was fitted to the data using the _ science tools _ , which take into account the energy - dependent instrument point spread function and effective area .",
    "we have analyzed the lat data from 100  mev to 25.6  gev using 13 logarithmically - spaced energy bands from 100  mev to 9.05  gev , and a single band above 9.05  gev .",
    "we then have compared the model and data in each energy band using a binned maximum - likelihood method with poisson statistics ( in @xmath70 bins ) ; we thus did not assume an a - priori spectral shape of each model component except for the ic emission .",
    "for the other components the convolution with the instrument response functions was performed assuming an @xmath71 spectrum , and the integrated intensities were allowed to vary in each narrow energy bin .",
    "changing the fixed spectral shape index over the range from @xmath72 to @xmath73 has a negligible effect on the obtained spectrum . in the highest energy band ,",
    "we have set both the normalization and the spectral index free to accommodate the wider bin width .",
    "we used a post - launch response function , p6_v3_diffuse , developed to account for the @xmath0-ray detection inefficiencies due to pile - up and accidental coincidence in the lat @xcite .",
    "we stopped at 25.6  gev since the photon statistics does not allow us to reliably separate different gas components above this energy .",
    "we started with point sources detected with high significance ( @xmath74 ) in the 1fgl catalog ; we have 14 sources in our roi for which the normalizations are set free .",
    "we also included 8 sources lying just outside ( @xmath75 ) of the region boundaries , with all the spectral parameters fixed to those in the 1fgl catalog .",
    "as a starting point we used h  maps prepared for @xmath13 . we added model components step by step as described below .",
    "we first fitted the lat data using equation  ( 1 ) without the @xmath35 map and the co map in the perseus arm , and then included the co map and confirmed that the fit improved significantly ; the test statistic summed over 14 bands with separate fits in each band ( i.e. , 14 more free parameters ) is 187.6 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission associated to the gas traced by co in the perseus arm is thus significantly detected by the lat .",
    "next we included the @xmath35 map in the analysis .",
    "we allowed the independent normalizations between the positive part and the negative part of the @xmath35 map , and found that the normalizations differ with each other .",
    "we thus will use the independent normalizations hereafter .",
    "we chose this model to better represent the lat data and constrain the cr distributions , and leave a detailed discussion about the use of dust as ism tracer to a dedicated paper .",
    "the improvement of the fit is very significant : @xmath76 for 28 more free parameters .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath35 map and the @xmath0-ray residual map obtained by the fit without the @xmath35 map , shown in figure  [ fig : ebv ] , further supports the use of @xmath35 map in our analysis .",
    "we also tried a fit without the ic component to assess the systematics .",
    "the effects on the derived emissivities are typically 23% and @xmath15 5% for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "they are much smaller than the statistical errors and systematic uncertainties ( see below ) , although the inclusion of the ic map improves the fit to the lat data .",
    "therefore the uncertainties on the ic model have no significant impact on our analysis due to its rather flat distribution across the region of interest while the gas in the ism is highly structured . on the other hand , lowering the threshold for point sources down to @xmath79 yields an about twice smaller emissivity for the @xmath10 map in the perseus arm .",
    "the emissivities of other components are unchanged within the statistical errors .",
    "this is plausibly due to the very clumpy distribution of the clouds in the perseus arm as seen by a terrestrial observer , see figure  [ fig : co ] , which makes it difficult to separate from that of some discrete sources .",
    "we thus use equation  ( 1 ) with point sources detected at @xmath80 in the 1fgl catalog as our baseline model , but we do not consider the highly uncertain co emissivities in the perseus arm for the discussion .    we summarize the results in tables  [ tab:125k ] and [ tab:250k ] for @xmath13 and 250  k , respectively , and the number of counts in each energy bin in table  [ tab : counts ] .",
    "the differential emissivities are multiplied by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the center of each energy bin in logarithmic scale .",
    "they are given for each model component .",
    "we note that our isotropic term ( @xmath64 ) includes the contribution of the instrumental background and might partially account also for ionized gas ( see   [ anamodel ] ) , thus it is significantly larger than the extragalactic diffuse emission reported by @xcite .    to illustrate the fit quality , we give the data and model count maps and the residual map in figure  [ fig : gammamap ] ( for @xmath13 ) , in which residuals ( data minus model ) are expressed in approximate standard deviation units ( square root of model - predicted counts ) . although some structures ( clustering of positive or negative residuals ) are observed , the map shows no excesses below @xmath83 and above @xmath84 .",
    "over 99% of the pixels are within @xmath85 .",
    "we thus conclude that our model reasonably reproduces the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : summaryspectra ] presents the fitted spectra for each component .",
    "the emission from the h  gas dominates the @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "although the emission from the gas in the co - bright phase and that traced by @xmath35 is fainter than the ic and isotropic components , their characteristic spatial structures ( see figure  [ fig : hi ] and [ fig : co ] ) allow their spectra to be reliably constrained .    to examine the effect of the optical depth correction applied to derive the h  maps , as anticipated above we tried several choices of a uniform @xmath14 .",
    "we stress that the true @xmath14 is likely to vary within clouds , but we stick to this simple approximation exploring the following values : 100  k ( which is a reasonable lower limit in the uniform approximation ) , 250  k and 400  k ( which are the two values indicated by absorption measurements in the outer galaxy by @xcite ) , and the optically - thin approximation ( which yields the lower limit allowed on the atomic column densities ) .",
    "the results on the maximum log - likelihood values are summarized in table  [ tab : lnl ] together with the integrated h  emissivities obtained above 100  mev in each region .",
    "the evolution of @xmath86 with @xmath14 is plotted in figure  [ fig : logl ] .",
    "the h  emissivity varies by @xmath87% for the local arm , @xmath88% for the interarm region , and @xmath89% for the perseus arm with respect to the @xmath13 case .",
    "we observe an increase of @xmath86 with increasing spin temperature .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath90 is a typical value in the second quadrant of the outer galaxy according to a recent study by @xcite and because @xmath86 saturates at @xmath91 , we regard 250  k as a plausible estimate of the average @xmath14 in our roi .",
    "unfortunately , the estimates by @xcite have a rather large uncertainty ( about  @xmath92  k ) in each galactocentric radius bin , and they do not cover the region in the third quadrant we are investigating ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ? * ) . in the following sections , we will concentrate on @xmath13 for comparison with previous @xmath0-ray measurements and on @xmath90 which agrees well with h  absorption and the lat data .",
    "in figures  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] ( left panels ) , we report the emissivity spectra found per h atom in the local arm , interarm , perseus arm and outermost regions for @xmath93 and 250  k , respectively . for comparison with the local interstellar spectrum ( lis )",
    "we also plot the model spectrum used in @xcite which agrees well with lat data in a mid - to - high - latitude region ( @xmath94 ) of the third quadrant ( assuming @xmath13 ) .",
    "we see that the spectral shape of the local - arm emissivity agrees well with the model for the lis and does not depend on the choice of spin temperature .",
    "the integral emissivity of the local arm is 10% lower than that reported by @xcite for the same spin temperature .",
    "this difference is not significant given the uncertainties in the kinematic separation of the gas components .",
    "the present result is also consistent with the measurement in the second quadrant @xcite .",
    "together they show that the cr density along the local arm is rather uniform within 1  kpc around the sun , both in the second and third quadrants .",
    "the comparison of the data with the model emissivity expected for the local arm region based on locally - measured crs ( figures  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] ) indicates a better fit for higher @xmath14 ; @xmath13 gives emissivities 1520% lower than the model , whereas @xmath90 shows better agreement by about 10% . although the theoretical emissivity has uncertainties due to imperfect knowledge of the cr spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fact that a high @xmath14 value yields a better match both to the local absolute emissivity and to the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission ( figure  [ fig : logl ] ) leads to larger @xmath14 than a value conventionally used in @xmath0-ray astrophysics ( 125  k ) .",
    "this is in accord with independent estimates of @xmath14 as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : procedure ] .",
    "we also observe that the emissivity spectra do not vary significantly with galactocentric distances in the outer galaxy . to examine the spectral shape more quantitatively , we present the emissivity ratios of the interarm and perseus regions relative to the local arm in the right panels of figures  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] . the spectral shape in the interarm region is found to be consistent with that in the local arm ; a fit to the data for @xmath13 with a constant ratio gives @xmath95 for 13 degrees of freedom . although the fit is not fully acceptable for the perseus arm ( @xmath96 ) , the large @xmath47 is driven solely by the last bin .",
    "we note a possible interplay between the perseus - arm and the adjacent outer - arm emissivities in the highest energy bins ( see left panels of figure  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] )",
    ". it can be due to a small but non - negligible spatial difference between the modeled templates and data and/or to the presence of unresolved point sources ( generally harder than diffuse emission ) .",
    "photon fluctuations from the structured gas components can also lead the fit to a slightly different solution in the spatial separation of the components .",
    "one would expect these possible systematic uncertainties to become important at high energy given the limited counts in the overall map .",
    "it is difficult to quantitatively test these effects without knowledge of the true model distributions , but we can note that the small deviations seen at 400560  mev and 1.62.2  gev from a constant ratio are not confirmed by the general trend of the other points .",
    "they indicate that there are systematic uncertainties not fully accounted for by the statistical errors in the fit .",
    "we thus do not claim nor deny the spectral softening of the perseus arm at high energy .",
    "a test using @xmath90 for the @xmath12(h ) maps gives the same conclusion on the spectral shape .",
    "we thus conclude that the spectral shapes are consistent with the lis in the @xmath97  gev energy band , independent of the assumed @xmath14 . considering that these @xmath0-rays trace cr nuclei of energies from a few gev to about 100  gev ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lat data indicate that the energy distribution of the main component of galactic crs does not vary significantly in the outer galaxy in the third quadrant .",
    "we note that @xcite reported a possible spectral hardening in the perseus arm in the second quadrant",
    ". this might be due to the presence of the very active star - forming region of ngc  7538 and of crs having not diffused far from their sources , or to contamination by hard unresolved point sources .",
    "in fact @xcite did not rule out the possibility that their result is due to systematic effects .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-rays are a powerful probe to determine the co - to - h@xmath98 calibration ratio , @xmath9 , if the cr flux is comparable in the different gas phases inside a cloud .",
    "since the @xmath0-ray emission from the molecular gas is primarily due to cr interactions with @xmath99 , and since the molecular binding energy is negligible in processes leading to @xmath0-ray production , the emissivity per @xmath99 molecule is expected to be twice the emissivity per h  atom .",
    "then , under the hypothesis that the same cr flux penetrates the h-  and co - bright phases of an interstellar complex , we can calculate @xmath9 as @xmath100 .",
    "we show @xmath78 as a function of @xmath77 for the local arm and the interarm region in figure  [ fig : xco ] .",
    "we do not consider the correlation in the perseus arm , because @xmath78 from this region is affected by large systematic uncertainties ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "since the emissivity associated with the co - bright gas is not well determined in the lowest energy range ( see table  [ tab:125k ] and [ tab:250k ] ) because of the poor angular resolution of the lat , and the fit at very high energy is affected by larger uncertainties (   4.1 ) , we have plotted only data in the 200  mev9.05  gev range .",
    "the linear correlation supports the assumption that galactic crs penetrate molecular clouds uniformly to their cores .",
    "it also suggests that contamination from point sources and cr spectral variations within the clouds are small .",
    "we have derived the maximum - likelihood estimates of the slope and intercept of the linear relation between @xmath78 and @xmath77 taking into account that @xmath78 and @xmath77 are both measured ( not true ) values with known uncertainties .",
    "the resulting intercepts are compatible with zero .",
    "the @xmath9 values we have obtained for @xmath90 are @xmath4 for the local arm ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 for the interarm region ( @xmath17 ) . decreasing the spin temperature to 125",
    "k does not affect the @xmath9 derivation in the well resolved , not too massive , clouds of the local arm where we find @xmath103 .",
    "on the other hand , the separation in the @xmath0-ray fit between the dense h  peaks and clumpy co cores becomes more difficult for more distant , less resolved clouds where h  and co tend to peak in the same directions .",
    "a change in the largest @xmath12(h ) column - densities from the optical depth correction can impact the @xmath9 determination in two ways : first by changing the @xmath77 emissivity , second by modifying the @xmath12(h ) contrast within the cloud , hence the h  and co separation .",
    "the global impact is mild since we find @xmath104 in the interarm region for @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite reported comparable values of @xmath9 in the second quadrant for @xmath13 : they obtained @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the local arm ( @xmath107 ) and the perseus arm .",
    "given the systematic uncertainty in @xmath9 , roughly of the order of @xmath108 , due to h  optical depth correction , the results of both studies point to a rather uniform ratio over several kpc in the outer galaxy . yet",
    ", these values are twice larger than found in the very nearby gould - belt clouds of cassiopeia and cepheus , @xmath109 , @xmath13 .",
    "however , we confirm that the increase in @xmath9 beyond the solar circle is significantly lower than the trend adopted in the model of @xcite . what fraction of the gould - belt to local - arm difference in the average @xmath9 can be attributed to a difference in the spatial sampling ( resolution ) of the clouds remains to be investigated .",
    "nearly the same region has been analyzed by @xcite using egret data .",
    "the main difference from their analysis is our improved scheme for the kinematical separation of the ism components along the lines of sight and the inclusion of the reddening residual map .",
    "the @xmath9 value measured in the local arm by egret , @xmath110 ( for @xmath13 ) , is statistically compatible with ours . the fact that we excluded the region of monoceros r2 from the analysis can also explain in part this difference .    because of the pile - up of different clouds along a line of sight , the derivation of individual cloud masses is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "let us just note that maddalena s cloud , with its very low rate of star formation , seems to share a quite conventional @xmath9 factor .",
    "further investigation , including higher resolution @xmath0-ray maps when more high - energy lat data become available , is required to fully understand the mass distribution in the clouds .      in figure",
    "[ fig : emissivitygradient ] ( left panel ) we show the emissivity gradient found beyond the solar circle for different spin temperatures . here we do not include the results for the optically - thin approximation which is equivalent to an infinitely high @xmath14 and gives similar emissivities to @xmath111 .",
    "the typical statistical errors associated with these measurements are illustrated in the right panel for the @xmath13 case . in the right panel",
    ", a shaded area shows the characteristic systematic error due to the lat event selection efficiency , evaluated to be @xmath112 in the energy range under study .    in order to evaluate the impact of the delicate separation of the gas in the outermost region ,",
    "we have compared two extreme cases .",
    "the first one adopts the kinematic @xmath25 kpc boundary and applies no correction for velocity dispersion , the second assigns all the outer - arm gas to the perseus arm .",
    "the emissivity in the perseus arm differs by about 5% from the original one , and those in the local arm and interarm regions hardly change .",
    "therefore these effects are significantly smaller than the uncertainties due to the optical depth correction of the h  data .",
    "we also note that the main effect of the lat selection efficiency uncertainty is to rigidly shift the profile without any significant impact on the gradient .",
    "we thus conclude that the most important source of uncertainty in the cr density gradient derivation is currently that in the @xmath12(h ) determination .",
    "this is mainly because the optical depth correction is larger for dense h  clouds in the local and perseus arms than for diffuse clouds in the interarm region .",
    "the loss in contrast between the dense ( low - latitude ) and more diffuse ( mid - latitude ) h  structures resulting from an increase in spin temperature affects the fit , particularly in the perseus component which is more narrowly concentrated near the plane . when probing the cr densities as the `` ratio '' between the observed numbers of @xmath0-rays to h atoms , at the precision provided by the lat the uncertainties in the ism densities are dominant .",
    "an interesting finding of the former egret analysis @xcite was an enhancement of the @xmath0-ray emissivity in the perseus arm compared with the interarm region .",
    "this possibility is relevant for models of diffuse @xmath0-ray emissions based on the assumption that cr and ism densities are coupled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the local arm emissivity obtained by the egret study for @xmath13 is @xmath113 , which is @xmath114 larger than our lat result .",
    "however , the two studies are based on different h  surveys which yield different total @xmath12(h ) column densities integrated along the lines of sight .",
    "the column - density ratios between the surveys varies from 0.6 to 1.0 within the roi , with an average value of @xmath115 .",
    "the difference is likely due to the improved correction for stray - radiation in the more recent survey , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the egret local - arm emissivity scaled by 0.8 is in good agreement with our result for the same spin temperature .",
    "if we do not include the @xmath35 map in the fitting , we obtain an emissivity of @xmath116 which is still consistent with the down - scaled egret result within @xmath1515% .",
    "we thus conclude that our result is consistent with the previous study but is more reliable because of higher @xmath0-ray statistics , finer resolution and an improved h  gas survey .",
    "we can therefore compare the present emissivity gradient ( for consistency in the case @xmath13 ) with that reported by the egret study , as summarized in figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] ( right panel in which the egret results multiplied by 0.8 are also shown ) .",
    "although we observe good agreement between the two studies in the local and the perseus arms , this is not true for the arm / interarm contrast .",
    "the difference could be due to the simple partitioning in cloud velocity used for the egret study .",
    "the h  mass obtained for clouds in the interarm region with the simple partitioning is @xmath117 larger ( for @xmath13 ) than with our separation scheme , exaggerating the amount of gas in the interarm region , and thus lowering the emissivity by the same amount .",
    "our emissivity profile is thus consistent with the previous study , but with improved precision ( smaller statistical errors ) and accuracy ( more reliable region separation method and better estimation of the point source contributions ) .",
    "we thus do not confirm a marked drop in the interarm region .",
    "low spin temperatures yield a smooth decline in h  emissivity to @xmath118 in the outer galaxy , without showing a significant coupling with ism column densities",
    ". the perseus - to - interarm contrast is at most of the order of 15%20% for high spin temperatures as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] .",
    "these profiles are similar at all energies , in particular at high energies where the component separation is more reliable thanks to the better angular resolution .",
    "the surface density of h  in the perseus arm is on average 30%40% higher than in the interarm region .",
    "therefore , even if we adopt @xmath111 which gives the largest arm - interarm contrast , the coupling scale ( or the coupling length ) between the crs and matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) required to agree with the lat data would be larger than those usually assumed for this type of model ( @xmath119 .",
    "see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  7 ) . whether the true emissivity profile exhibits a small contrast between the arms or smoothly declines with distance is beyond our measurement capability without further constraints on the hcolumn - density derivation .",
    "new h  absorption measurements will allow us to investigate this issue with better accuracy .      to compare with the second quadrant results @xcite , we have integrated the emissivities above 200  mev for @xmath13 .",
    "we find values of @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the local - arm , interarm , and perseus - arm regions , respectively .",
    "the nearer value is about 20% lower than in the 2nd quadrant ( which , however , samples very nearby clouds in the gould belt ) and the outer ones compare very well with the 2nd quadrant measurement over the same galactocentric distance range . despite the uncertainties due to the optical - depth correction ( that might have a different impact in the two quadrants ) , both lat studies consistently point to a slowly decreasing emissivity profile beyond @xmath123 .",
    "let us consider the predictions by a cr propagation model to see the impact of such a flat profile on the cr source distribution and propagation parameters .",
    "we adopted a galprop model , starting from the configuration used for the run 54_77xvarh7s which we used to predict the ic contribution .",
    "the cr source distribution in this model is ,    @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the distance of the sun to the galactic center .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : crsourcemodel ] , this function is intermediate between the distribution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) obtained from the @xmath126 relation @xcite and that traced by pulsars @xcite .",
    "the boundaries of the propagation region are chosen to be @xmath127 ( maximum galactocentric radius ) and @xmath128 ( maximum height from the galactic plane ) , beyond which free escape is assumed .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient is assumed to be uniform across the galaxy and is taken as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light and @xmath131 is the rigidity .",
    "we adopted @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( kolmogorov spectrum ) .",
    "reacceleration due to the interstellar magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , which is thought to reproduce the observed b / c ratio at low energy , assumes an alfvn velocity @xmath134 .",
    "the cr source distribution and propagation model parameters have been used often in the literature ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the same cr source distribution and similar propagation parameters are adopted in the galprop run used by @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : gradientmodeldata ] compares the calculated profile ( solid line ) with lat constraints ( bow - tie plot bracketing the profiles obtained for different @xmath14 ; see the left panel of figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] ) .",
    "the model is normalized to the lat measurement in the innermost region . despite the large uncertainties , lat data lead to a significantly flatter profile than predicted by our model ; the lat results indicate to a factor of 2 larger emissivity ( cr energy density ) in the perseus arm even if we assume @xmath135 .",
    "the higher @xmath14 makes the discrepancy larger , hence the conclusion is robust . not using",
    "the @xmath35 map in the analysis does not change the conclusion , since the emissivities in the interarm region and the perseus arm are almost unaffected by its presence .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath0-ray emissivity gradient in the galaxy and the distribution of putative cr sources has been known as the `` gradient problem '' since the cos - b era ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has led to a number of possible interpretations , including , for the specific case of the outer galaxy , the possibility of a very steep gradient in @xmath9 beyond the solar circle @xcite .",
    "the emissivities in the outer galaxy were more difficult to determine in the cos - b / egret era due to lower statistics and higher backgrounds .",
    "now , thanks to the high quality of the lat data and the improved component separation technique applied to gas line data , we measure a flat h  emissivity gradient in the outer galaxy together with a flat evolution of @xmath9 over several kpc , so the gradient problem requires another explanation .",
    "the most straightforward possibility is a larger halo size ( @xmath136 ) , as discussed by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we therefore tried several choices of @xmath136 and @xmath137 as summarized in the dotted lines in the same figure .",
    "the values of @xmath137 are chosen to reasonably reproduce the lis of protons and electrons , b / c ratio and @xmath138 ratio at the solar system , and are similar to those given in @xcite .",
    "all models are normalized to the lat data in the local arm .",
    "models with @xmath139 or smaller are found to give too steep emissivity gradients .",
    "a cr source distribution as in equation  2 with a very large halo ( @xmath140 ) provides a gradient compatible with the @xmath0-ray data , if we fully take into account the systematic uncertainties .",
    "we note that @xmath141 is still compatible with @xmath138 measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "considering the large statistical and systematic uncertainties in the snr distribution , a flatter cr source distribution in the outer galaxy also could be possible .",
    "we thus tried a modified cr source distribution , in which the distribution is the same as equation  2 below @xmath142 and constant beyond it ( see a thin solid line of figure  [ fig : crsourcemodel ] as an example ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : gradientmodeldata ] right shows the models with several choices of @xmath142 for @xmath128 and @xmath132 .",
    "we obtained a reasonable fit to the data using a flat cr source distribution beyond @xmath143 .",
    "such a constant cr source density in the outer galaxy is in contrast not only with the ( highly uncertain ) distribution of snrs , but also with other tracers of massive star formation and snrs , like , 1 ) co lines which trace the interstellar phase where massive stars form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2 ) ob star counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 3 ) the @xmath144al line which is related to the injection of stellar nucleosynthesis products in the ism by snrs @xcite .",
    "however , a very large halo size and/or a flat cr source distribution just beyond the solar circle seem to be favored by the lat data .",
    "the above discussion depends on the propagation parameters and the solution is not unique .",
    "the exploration could be extended to other regions of the parameter space or to a non - uniform diffusion coefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but examining propagation models in detail is beyond the scope of our study .",
    "our bottom line is that the analysis of lat data presented here and by @xcite consistently show that the cr density gradient in the outer galaxy is flatter than expectations by commonly - used propagation models . in the future , the extension to the inner part and the accurate determination of the gradient over the whole galaxy will be key to constraining the cr origin and transport .",
    "we also note that a spin temperature @xmath91 , which is favored by recent studies in the outer galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gives a small arm / interarm contrast at the 1020% level that is not fully compatible with the propagation models ( including the one we adopted here ) which predict a monotonic cr gradient .    even though the present analysis includes a dust template to account for the abundant missing gas present locally at the interface between the h  and co - bright phases , an alternative way to reconcile the flat emissivity profile and",
    "a marked decline in cr density in the outer galaxy is to invoke an increase in missing gas mass with galactocentric distance in the low metallicity environments of the outer galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) beyond the local correction applied here .",
    "we note that the large masses of dark gas in the outer galaxy suggested by @xcite ( outweighing that of h  by a factor of 5 - 15 ) might explain our results , whereas the remarkably constant dark gas fraction of  30% with mild dependence on metallicity suggested by @xcite is not sufficient to explain the large h  emissivities measured by the lat beyond the solar circle .",
    "we have studied the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission in the third galactic quadrant using the first 18 months of _ fermi _ lat science data .",
    "thanks to the excellent performance of the lat , we have obtained high - quality emissivity spectra of the atomic and molecular gas ( traced by @xmath10 ) in the 100  mev ",
    "25.6  gev energy range .    at the level of accuracy allowed by the lat ,",
    "the study of cr densities from @xmath0-ray observations is now mostly limited by the understanding of the ism mass tracers , notably by the uncertainties in the derivation of atomic gas column densities from h  surveys and by the distribution of gas not accounted for by radio and microwave line surveys . in spite of those uncertainties",
    ", robust conclusions can be drawn concerning the ism and crs .",
    "the molecular mass calibration ratio of the local arm is found to be @xmath145 , significantly larger than that for the very local gould - belt clouds in the second galactic quadrant reported by @xcite .",
    "no significant differences of the ratio are found between the local arm and the interarm region .",
    "no significant variations in the cr spectra are found across the outer galaxy in the region studied , and no large contrast in emissivity is seen in the interarm region between the local and perseus arms ( a contrast @xmath146 1020% is allowed by data ) .",
    "the measured gradient is much flatter than predictions by a widely - used propagation model assuming that the cr source distribution largely peaks in the inner galaxy . a larger halo size and/or a flatter cr source distribution beyond the solar circle than those usually assumed",
    "are required to reproduce the lat data , while other scenarios such as a non - uniform diffusion coefficient or vast amounts of missing gas in the outer galaxy are also possible .",
