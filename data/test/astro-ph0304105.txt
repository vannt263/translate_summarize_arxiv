    "there is much evidence ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ) that nonthermal processes power the nuclei , i.e. , the central sources , of seyfert galaxies . in the mid - infrared",
    ", however , thermal radiation from heated dust contributes an additional emission component .",
    "this mid - infrared radiation , at characteristic temperatures of a few hundred kelvin , is believed to emerge from a disk - like structure that is heated by the inner accretion disk ( sanders et al .",
    "a question remains of the geometry of the central , presumably mainly nonthermal , source and how much of the surrounding dust is heated by the central source and how much is heated by starbursts which are located throughout the nucleus and thus form an extended cloud .",
    "it is difficult to resolve this dust component in direct observations using currently available telescopes because the angular extent of the region containing the emitting dust is small .",
    "quantitatively , the seyfert galaxies considered here have observed luminosities of 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7l@xmath8 .",
    "if the dust is at a temperature of @xmath5300  k  the temperature at which blackbody emission peaks at 12.5  @xmath0 m and is heated by a central source , it is predicted to have a separation from the central source 2 - 20 pc or @xmath1  0@xmath2.1 depending on the composition of the dust .",
    "if , on the other hand , the dust were heated by hot stars in starburst regions , the extent of the region containing dust clouds could be much larger .",
    "the diffraction limited full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the keck 10-m telescope  the largest aperture telescope presently available  is 0@xmath2.31 at 12.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "deconvolution techniques and proper sampling of a nearby point source function ( psf ) can improve this resolution significantly .",
    "for example , deconvolution applied to the image of ngc  1068  the nearest and brightest seyfert galaxy  have successfully resolved structure with a size of 0@xmath2.1 ( @xmath57  pc at the distance of ngc  1068 , bock et al .",

    "in this paper we present observations of the nuclei of three nearby , infrared bright seyfert galaxies  ngc  1275 , ngc  4151 , and ngc  7469  taken with the keck 10-m telescope .",
    "these observations , when deconvolved , approach the angular resolution necessary to distinguish thermal from nonthermal emission and , in one case , resolve the structure of the central source . in the mid - infrared ,",
    "all three galaxies are known to contain a strong point - like nucleus and the observations were designed , and optimized , to probe this source . as a result , they are not optimized to delineate low surface brightness , extended emission .",
    "they are thus complementary to observations such as those by radomski et al .",

    "the characteristics of the three seyfert galaxies ( seyfert 1943 ) , taken from the literature , are shown in table  1 . all are known to be bright in the mid - infrared ( iras point source catalog 1989 ; miles et al .",
    "ngc  1275 and ngc  4151 are both compact in the mid - infrared .",
    "miles et al .   have shown , from observations at @xmath510  @xmath0 m with 0@xmath2.7 resolution , that ngc  7469 consists of a compact nucleus surrounded by a lumpy ring @xmath53@xmath2 in diameter .",
    "the ring is presumably a region of active star formation .",
    "miles et al . found that the nucleus plus ring structure in ngc  7469 accounts for @xmath560% of the total 12  @xmath0 m flux density of the galaxy measured by iras .",
    "the observations were made using the keck long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; jones & puetter 1993 ) in the imaging mode at 12.5  @xmath0 m ( @xmath10= 1.16  @xmath0 m ) at the f/25 forward cassegrain focus of the keck i 10-m telescope . the lws si : as array has 128 @xmath3 128 pixels .",
    "the scale is 0@xmath2.08  pixel@xmath9 giving a field of @xmath510@xmath11  10@xmath2 .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  2 .",
    "in the mid - infrared there were no stars in the field from which to estimate point source profiles .",
    "each measurement of the object size was therefore accompanied by multiple observations of one of the three bright stars , identified as the psf in table  2 , which was nearby to the object and of comparable infrared brightness .",
    "the observations were made in runs of 27  54  s by interleaving imaging of the galaxy with observations of the psf star ; the number of comparisons between the galaxy and the psf star is also indicated in table  2 .",
    "the telescope was guided during the observations of the objects using a visual guider on stars near the galaxies .",
    "for these observations , objects and psf calibrators were imaged in a chop - nod scheme where the throw of the secondary chopper was equal to the amplitude of the ( telescope ) nod .",
    "the amplitude of the secondary chopper was set to 5@xmath2 ",
    "15@xmath2 at a frequency @xmath55",
    "all three nights were photometric and in all cases the airmass was between 1.0 and 1.4 . each sequence to measure the object size was preceded by an observation of one of the three bright stars    @xmath12 tau = hr  1457 , @xmath12 boo = hr  5340 , or @xmath13 peg = hr  8775     in order to obtain a photometric calibration .",
    "photometric measurements were made from the raw images before any deconvolution algorithms ( described below ) were applied .",
    "the photometry of the galaxies was based on the following magnitudes ( in the vega based system )  hr  1457 : [ 12.5  @xmath0m]=-3.07  mag , hr  5340 :  @xmath14m]=-3.15  mag , and hr  8775 :  @xmath14m]=-2.55  mag .",
    "the `` sky '' was taken as an annulus 46 to 60 in diameter .",
    "the conversion from magnitude to flux density followed the prescription given in the explanatory supplement to the iras catalog ( beichman et al.1985 ) ; i.e. , at 12.5  @xmath0 m , 0.0  mag was taken as 26.15  jy .",
    "the images were processed following a similar procedure to that described in bock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , briefly summarized as follows .",
    "images were obtained by shifting and combining sub - images after every chop pair , using only the central image , to eliminate any possibility of non - reproducibility in the telescope nod , i.e. , potential differences caused by guiding the telescope were obviated in software by finding the centroid of each object image in each nod .",
    "both end chop images did not always fall onto the array , so were not used in the data reduction .",
    "the results when the end images were included , however , were found to be appreciably the same .",
    "for the psfs , which were not guided , each chop - nod combination consisted of four separate images , which were combined to produce three images : an image near the middle of the array and two images near the edge or off the array .",
    "the middle image was thus seen twice , first in the positive beam of the first chop pair , and then in the negative beam of the second chop pair .",
    "the objects were guided , and eight sub - images were combined into the three images ; the middle image was thus seen four times.the object and psf calibrator images were sub - pixel shifted , rotated , and co - added using a routine that relies on sub - nyquist sampling of the images .",
    "the objects were rotated from array coordinates to equatorial north coordinates during the combination .",
    "the psf calibrators were rotated through a sequence of rotations in array coordinates matched to the object .",
    "the rotations were designed to best match the orientation of the characteristic six - pointed diffraction pattern as it appeared on the array for both object and psf calibrator .",
    "this pattern is fixed with respect to the telescope and thus in paralactic angle and therefore rotates in the field as the telescope tracks .",
    "the resulting psf was thus not rotated to equatorial north , but was rotated through a superposition of rotation angles corresponding to the orientation of the diffraction pattern of the object sequence as it appeared on the array .",
    "the rotations for each psf / object combination were always matched pair - wise , producing a matched psf for every subset of object images under consideration .      because the combined images of the objects were all very nearly point - like and closely resembled the combined psf calibrator images , and variations in the psf , not statistical noise , dominated the overall uncertainty in deconvolving these images , it was necessary to evaluate the stability of the psf by comparing the raw object and psf calibrator images before proceeding to image deconvolution .",
    "an estimate of the intrinsic source size of the object was obtained by assuming the sizes add in quadrature ,    @xmath15 ,    where @xmath16 is the intrinsic source size of the object , @xmath17 is the observed psf size , and @xmath18 is the observed object size all expressed as fwhm .",
    "an estimate of the uncertainty can be gotten from @xmath19 , the dispersion of @xmath20 in the population of pairs .",
    "we will take the quantity @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] as the estimate of the upper limit on the source size .",
    "it should be noted that this definition takes account of the fact that the objects and psfs are often comparable in size , and the fact that the size of the object image on occasion exceeds that of the psf .",
    "each combined object image was deconvolved by a matched psf calibrator image using the richardson - lucy procedure ( richardson 1972 ; lucy 1974 ) as encoded in the idl maximum likelihood routine ( varosi & landsman 1993 ) .",
    "the images were interpolated to a four times finer pixel scale before deconvolution .",
    "the reconvolved image was rebinned and subtracted from the original image and compared with the estimated statistical uncertainty per pixel .",
    "it was found , however , that the uncertainties were largest where the image was brightest , and were always greater than the statistical uncertainties even after iterating the deconvolution routine a large number of times .",
    "the non - uniform uncertainties from deconvolution must be compared to a combination of statistical and psf uncertainties in the region of image of interest .",
    "therefore we chose to stop iterating the deconvolution routine when the residuals were consistent with the measurement uncertainties in the raw images .",
    "ngc  7469 showed a statistically significant detection of structure while the images of ngc  1275 and ngc  4151 , combining all the data , both showed a single point - like compact nucleus .",
    "the fwhm of various angular quantities , obtained before deconvolution was applied , are given in table  3 .",
    "although the uncertainties on the @xmath22 are small , we claim , to be conservative , only to have measured a limiting size for the nuclei of ngc  1275 and ngc  4151 of @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that the psf during the ngc  7469 observations was noticeably more compact and significantly more stable than for any of the other objects .",
    "deconvolution applied to the combined ngc  7469 image confirmed the presence of clear structure .    in the case of ngc  1275 and ngc  7469 ,",
    "the data were extensive enough to provide several sets of the object and the psf calibrator .",
    "the images were paired to both match the object and psf calibrator images in airmass and to minimize the time interval between the two images .",
    "unfortunately , the ngc  4151 data were quite limited , resulting in only two image pairs . in order to obtain a meaningful limit ,",
    "the data were simply sub - divided into five image pairs . this is less than ideal since the pairs all have a common time interval , and the matching in airmass was poor .",
    "further sub - dividing the ngc  4151 images was possible , but gave a nearly identical result . from the present data we conclude that 0@xmath2.16 is an upper limit to the size of the nucleus . in comparison ,",
    "neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , using slit scans and a single element detector , determined the size of the nucleus of ngc  4151 at 11.2  @xmath0 m to be 0@xmath2.16  @xmath24  0@xmath2.04 .",
    "the deconvolved images of ngc  4151 and ngc  1275 do not show structure and these sources appear to be unresolved in these observations . as stated above",
    ", the deconvolution algorithm did not improve the size limit beyond that set by the variations in the psf and we choose to quote the upper limit of the sizes as the size estimated in the analysis of the fwhm in the raw images .    as expected from the work of miles",
    "( 1996 ) , the raw images of ngc  7469 show a bright compact nucleus surrounded by a fainter ring .",
    "the flux from the ring , which has a diameter of @xmath53@xmath2 and is well separated from the nucleus , is comparable to that of the nucleus .",
    "the surface brightness from the ring is less than 5% of the brightness of the central source in the raw image .",
    "[ note that because of the small chop amplitude of these observations we can not make a reliable flux measurement in an adequately large beam to determine this ratio . ]",
    "photometric results are included in the summary of table  4 . with 20  % uncertainties , the flux densities of the compact sources of ngc  1275 and ngc  4151 reported here at 12.5  @xmath0",
    "m agree with those measured at 12  @xmath0 m by iras in a 4@xmath25.5  @xmath3  0@xmath25.8 beam .",
    "these results are consistent with the results on ngc  4151 reported by radomski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who find that 73  % of the 10  @xmath0 m broad band flux is in an unresolved component .",
    "we will assume that the luminosity and color as measured by iras applies to the compact sources .",
    "the flux density of the compact nucleus of ngc  7469 inside a 14 diameter beam is 40  % of the flux density at 12.0  @xmath0 m measured in the much larger iras beam .      the deconvolved image of ngc  7469 , after combining all the data ,",
    "shows significant structure both in the ring and in the nucleus .",
    "the deconvolution routine reaches statistical noise on the 3@xmath2 diameter ring in about ten iterations , due to its low surface brightness .",
    "maximum likelihood does not perform well on images like this requiring large dynamic range , and we note that although many more iterations are needed to resolve the nucleus , they are of no further use in resolving the ring . the deconvolution of the image with ten iterations , thus emphasizing the 3@xmath2 diameter ring , is shown in figure  1 . for purposes of deconvolving the nucleus",
    ", the ring does not affect the images of the central source .",
    "this assertion was tested by deconvolving a 38  @xmath3  38 image of ngc  7469 containing the ring , and by deconvolving a 16  @xmath3  16 image of ngc  7469 excluding the ring .",
    "both deconvolutions produce essentially identical images of the inner 1@xmath26 nucleus . in the following",
    "we will often designate the central nucleus of ngc  7469 simply as `` ngc  7469 '' .",
    "the deconvolved image of the ngc  7469 nucleus with 1000 iterations of the deconvolution algorithm is presented in figure  2 and shows extended structure that is statistically significant based on the estimate of psf variations .",
    "the robustness of the deconvolution technique was tested by sub - dividing the observations of the psf into subgroups and treating successive subgroups as objects .",
    "this test is described in appendix  a. the reproducibility of the extension shown in figure  2 was likewise tested by sub - dividing the data into independent object and psf calibrator images and deconvolving the corresponding image pairs , as shown in the appendix  b. the statistical significance can be evaluated quantitatively by comparing the quality of fit of the hypothesized elongated source to that obtained under the assumption of a simple point source .",
    "this procedure is described in appendix  c with the result that the elongation is estimated to be significant at the 4.3-@xmath27 confidence level .    to summarize the appendices ,",
    "we conclude the extension of ( @xmath104 )  @xmath3  008 seen in ngc  7469 is real for the following reasons :    \\1 .",
    "structure in ngc  7469 was detected statistically based on the fwhm of the object and the psf .",
    "deconvolved psf images , synthesized from the observations for matching in time and airmass , are point - like and more compact than the deconvolved images of ngc  7469 .",
    "deconvolved images using independent pairs of ngc  7469 and the psf produce consistent results with a northwest - southeast extension of similar size and direction .",
    "although the observations were not optimized to study extended emission , the quantity and quality of the data on ngc  1275 and ngc  7469 were sufficiently great to attempt an examination of the extended emission using the technique exploited successfully by radomski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the study of ngc  4151 .",
    "these high resolution images , combined with a precise knowledge of the psf , allow us to best probe extended emission close to the nucleus .    in figure  3 ,",
    "two sets of differences  the galaxy minus the psf and the galaxy minus a fraction of the psf are given .",
    "there is evidence in ngc  7469 for emission in the northwest  southeast direction  i.e. , the orientation of the structure in the deconvolved image  extending almost 1@xmath2 while in ngc  1275 there is an indication of extended emission in the north - south direction .",
    "the putative extended emission is only about three times brighter than the psf residuals , so we advise caution in interpreting these images , especially at the radius of the first airy maximum ( radius = 0.4@xmath2 ) .",
    "although faint , the extended emission reproduces itself if the images are constructed using independent subsets of the data from the first half and second half of the observations , in spite of the fact that the change in paralactic angle rotates the apparent diffraction pattern by 10 @xmath4 . in ngc  7469 ,",
    "the structure noted here is also seen in figure  1 .",
    "the observations at 12.5  @xmath0 m with the 10-m keck telescope yield a resolved structure in ngc  7469 , but give only limits for the size of ngc  1275 and ngc  4151 ; see table  4 . at the distances of the galaxies , the limits on the angular sizes correspond to linear size limits of 10  pc in ngc  4151 and 27  pc in ngc  1275 .",
    "although an asymmetry is obvious in ngc  1068 at a comparable physical scale , none is obvious in ngc  4151 in our images .",
    "the physical temperatures implied for dust grains heated by a central source of luminosity are between 300  k and 450  k depending on the sizes of the individual grains and their composition .",
    "this is substantially hotter than the observed color temperature , based on iras 12  @xmath0 m and 25  @xmath0 m data , of 192  k and 201  k for ngc  1275 and ngc  4151 respectively . as shown in table  4 ,",
    "the limits on the sizes in these sources are not small enough to require optically thick emission , but the lower bound on @xmath28 is 0.25 in ngc  1275 and 0.06 in ngc  4151 if the emission is thermal emission at the color temperature determined from the iras 12  @xmath0 m to 25  @xmath0 m flux density ratio .",
    "this calculation , of course , requires the reasonable assumption that the source structure is essentially the same at 25 and 12  @xmath0 m .    in the case of ngc  7469",
    ", the resolved structure provides strong direct evidence for the dust thermal emission model in the nucleus as well as a limit of @xmath29  0.4 within this structure ( table  4 ) .",
    "the elongated structure is suggestive of a disk geometry .",
    "the `` standard model''of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ; sanders et al .",
    "1989 ) suggests that this disk is heated by the central agn .",
    "the fact , noted above , that graphite and silicate dust grains at distances of @xmath515  pc from the central source , i.e. at the linear radius corresponding to the angular size of the structure , are heated to temperatures of 300 - 450  k , well above the observed color temperature , is consistent with this picture .",
    "the derived brightness temperature , again well below 300  k , is only a limit since the source is unresolved in one dimension .",
    "an interesting question is what is the relationship of the infrared nucleus to the nuclear structure of the galaxy observed in the radio .",
    "observations by thean et al .",
    "( 2001 ) at 1.6-ghz ( 18-cm ) at @xmath5  03 resolution show structure whose orientation is very similar to that seen in the mid - infrared structure .",
    "a similar feature is also seen at 4.9-ghz ( 6-cm ) in the vla image of wilson et al .",
    "although again at a much lower spatial resolution ( 2@xmath2 ) than that seen here in the mid - infrared , high resolution maps in co ( meixner et al .",
    "1990 ) show emission , interpreted as a rotating molecular disk , whose orientation also is similar to that seen in the mid - infrared structure .",
    "vlbi observations of lonsdale , lonsdale & smith ( 2003 ) at 18-cm show that the nucleus of ngc  7469 is a nearly symmetric linear triple source aligned in the east - west direction with the outer components separated by 015 , and the central source nearly centered between these two components .",
    "the agreement between the centroids of the radio peak , as described by lonsdale et al .  , and the mid - infrared peaks is excellent , the two peaks coinciding to within 0040 if the 3@xmath2 ring structures are assumed to be spatially coincident . the uncertainty in the determination of the astrometric coincidence of the radio and infrared nuclei is determined by how well the structures in the 3@xmath2 ring can be aligned .",

    "the object and psf images are very closely matched in airmass and time interval ( see table  a2 ) .",
    "the data set was divided into independent images of the object and psf to assess the stability of the northwest - southeast extension in the deconvolved image of ngc  7469 . splitting the data into two independent images of ngc  7469 and the psf , n_12//psf_12 and n_34//psf_34 , results in two images which both show a similar northwest - southeast extension ; see figure  6 .",
    "this agreement is remarkable given that the image pairs are completely independent . as shown in figure  6 , further sub - dividing the data into four sub - images and psfs results in four individual images which all show the northwest - southeast extension .",
    "furthermore , all images also show two smaller isolated structures located about 0@xmath2.5 to the northwest and southwest .",
    "a smaller structure located @xmath50@xmath2.3 to the east is seen in the two image pairs , but not in each of the four independent sub - images .",
    "the statistical significance of the elongated structure apparent in the deconvolved images of ngc  7469 was evaluated by comparing the quality of fit of the hypothesized elongated source to that obtained under the assumption of a simple point source .",
    "this comparison is based on the residuals with respect to the observed data for the two cases , taking into account our knowledge of the properties of the measurement noise .",
    "the residual images are shown in panels ( e ) and ( f ) of figure  7 , along with the sequence of images used to generate them , consisting of : ( a ) observed image , ( b ) psf , ( c ) ",
    "model \" image representing the central source obtained by deconvolution , and ( d ) the model image convolved with the psf . the residual image ( e )",
    "was obtained by subtracting ( d ) from ( a ) , and is to be compared with ( f ) , which represents the residual image corresponding to the best point - source fit , i.e , the residual image obtained by subtracting ( b ) from ( a ) .",
    "the comparison of ( e ) and ( f ) shows that the residuals are noticeably lower for the extended source than for the point source .",
    "the relative probabilities of the two source - geometry hypotheses can be calculated by comparing the conditional probabilities of the extended source and a point source given the data ( represented by a vector * y * whose components represent the pixel values of the observed image ) by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "a simple application of bayes rule then yields : @xmath37/ \\sigma_i^2\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the point - source and extended - source model images convolved with the psf , respectively , and @xmath40 represents the measurement noise in the @xmath41th pixel .",
    "the summation is over all statistically independent pixels in the image . in deriving this equation a flat prior",
    "was assumed , representing equal _ a priori _ probabilities of extended and point sources .",
    "the measurement noise is assumed to be a gaussian random process with variance : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the standard deviation of the background ( obtained using pixels far from the source itself ) , @xmath44 is the source strength in data units , and @xmath45 is the  variance map \" of the psf , representing the normalized value of psf uncertainty as a function of position . the psf variance map was obtained using the deconvolution residuals of four independent sub - images of the psf calibrator and smoothing the result using a @xmath46-pixel boxcar averaging window .",
    "the psf uncertainty term in the above expression represents a good approximation in the case of a marginally resolved source .",
    "based on this procedure , a probability ratio @xmath47 was obtained . after normalizing the sum of the two probabilities to unity , this result implies that the probability that the data were produced by a point source was of this same order , which corresponds to a @xmath48 ( or greater ) deviation of a gaussian random variable . we can therefore equate the significance of our result to a @xmath49 detection of source elongation .",
