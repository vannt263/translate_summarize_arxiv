    "essentially all low - redshift , powerful ( @xmath14 w  hz@xmath15  sr@xmath15 ) radio galaxies are housed in normal giant elliptical galaxies . thus radio selection has long been regarded as providing an efficient method of identifying high - redshift ellipticals . however , very radio - powerful high - redshift sources have proved virtually useless as probes of galaxy evolution due to the contaminating effects of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) at ultraviolet  infrared wavelengths ( mccarthy et  al .",
    "1987 ; tadhunter et  al .",
    "1992 ; best , longair & rttgering 1996 , 1997 ) . given the success of the lyman - break technique for selecting high - redshift galaxies on the basis of their optical colours ( steidel et  al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) , it might be presumed that radio galaxies are no longer of any importance for probing galaxy evolution .",
    "in fact , nothing could be further from the truth , since the identification of high - redshift galaxies at optical wavelengths is by necessity biased towards the bluest , most ultraviolet - active systems  such methods can not detect old or dust - reddened sources .",
    "what is required is an _ optically unbiased _",
    "selection method , such as radio selection at low flux densities .",
    "unlike their high - power counterparts , faint radio sources have only weak emission lines ( kron , koo & windhorst 1985 ) and show little evidence of an alignment effect ( dunlop & peacock 1993 )",
    ".    there are a number of radio surveys with millijansky flux density limits at 1.4  ghz ( @xmath16  mjy ) .",
    "this limit is sufficiently _ faint _ that a large fraction of the sources potentially lie at high redshifts , and yet sufficiently _ bright _ that objects selected at this flux density are still predominantly radio galaxies rather than low - redshift starbursts ( hopkins et  al.2000 ) .",
    "some of the more recent surveys are the first survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ; white et  al .",
    "1997 ) , the nvss ( condon et  al .  1998 ) , the vla survey of the elais regions ( ciliegi et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and the atca survey of the marano field ( gruppioni et  al .",
    "1997 ) . in order to study the evolution of the hosts of these radio sources ,",
    "it is essential to identify optical / infrared counterparts to a majority of the radio sources .",
    "this has not yet been achieved for any of these recent surveys .",
    "this paper presents essentially complete optical identifications for a subsample of the leiden  berkeley deep survey ( lbds ; windhorst , van heerde & katgert 1984a ) , together with infrared @xmath5-band observations of 85% of the optically identified sources . a companion paper ( waddington et  al.2000a ; hereafter paper ii )",
    "will present the results of the spectroscopic observations and photometric redshift estimates of these sources .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "2 the radio observations and previous work using the lbds are reviewed , and the resolution corrections for the sources are recalculated . in section  3",
    "the optical identifications and photometry of sources in the hercules sample are presented .",
    "the infrared observations are presented in section  4 .",
    "finally , section  5 is a discussion of the properties of the sample as a whole and of a number of the individual sources , and compares the @xmath5-band magnitude distribution to that of brighter radio surveys .",
    "unless otherwise stated , a cosmology with @xmath17  km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is assumed .",
    "the lbds began with a collection of multi - colour prime focus plates that had been acquired with the 4-m mayall telescope at kitt peak for the purpose of faint galaxy and quasar photometry @xcite .",
    "several high latitude fields were chosen in the selected areas sa28 ( referred to as lynx ) , sa57 , sa68 and an area in hercules .",
    "the fields were selected on purely optical criteria , such as high galactic latitude ( @xmath20 ) and minimum h column density , resulting in a random area of sky from the radio perspective .",
    "nine of these fields were then surveyed with the 3-km westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) at 21  cm ( 1.412  ghz ) with a 125 beam @xcite .",
    "these observations yielded noise limited maps with @xmath210.28 mjy in 12  hours , with absolute uncertainties in position of order 04 and in flux of order 35% .",
    "a total of 471 sources were found , out of which a complete sample of 306 sources was selected .",
    "this complete sample is defined by : ( 1 ) a peak signal - to - noise @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath231.0 mjy ; and ( 2 ) a limiting primary beam attenuation of @xmath24  db , which corresponds to a radius of 0464 , or an attenuation factor @xmath25 . with this attenuation radius",
    ", the wsrt field then covers the same area as the mayall 4-m plates .",
    "images were also made at the resolution of the 1.5-km wsrt ( @xmath26 mjy ; windhorst et  al .",
    "1984a ) and at 50  cm ( 0.609  ghz ) with the 3-km wsrt ( @xmath27 mjy ; windhorst 1984 ) .",
    "the radio data for the two hercules fields are summarised in table  [ radiotable ] .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for five sources ( 53w010 , 53w019 , 53w020 , 53w022 , 53w027 ) , only @xmath3-band observations from the 1984 run were available so no colour correction could be applied to them .",
    "in addition , only two standard star observations were available for each of the two nights , which was inadequate to determine both the extinction and zero - points .",
    "thus , the mean extinction coefficient from table  [ kccoeffs ] was adopted , and the zero - point calculated from the observed magnitudes of the standards . for five other sources ( 53w080 , 53w081 , 53w085 , 53w086 , 53w090 ) , no photometric calibrations were available for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images .",
    "the zero - points adopted for these mosaics were taken as the mean of the zero - points for all the other observations in the sample .",
    "this is reflected in the slightly larger errors for these sources in table  [ photmaster ] .",
    "the sky background subtraction for each source was done using a method based upon the image reduction package cassandra by d.  p.  schneider , adapted to run as an iraf task using the apphot package for the numerical work . a rectangular box ( typically 1020  on a side ) surrounding the source , and excluding any other objects ,",
    "was cut out of the mosaic image .",
    "a plane was fitted to this box , excluding from the fit a circle centered on the source , and the sky was subtracted from the image .",
    "photometry was performed using a circular aperture of 40 , 75 or 100 diameter ( depending on the extent of the source ) , with the sky statistics determined over the remainder of the box .",
    "this enabled a large asymmetric sky aperture to be used , which is not possible with the basic apphot , in addition to providing a better measure of the sky background than is possible with an annulus around the object .    during testing of this method",
    "an error was found in the way that apphot calculates magnitude errors for faint objects .",
    "apphot makes the approximation @xmath28 which for faint sources overestimates the error by as much as 0.10.2 magnitudes .",
    "this was corrected by including the second , and for good measure the third , order terms in the expansion : @xmath29 .",
    "the apparent magnitude was then calculated from equation  [ mageqn1 ] using the coefficients in table  [ kccoeffs ] and the appropriate zero - points .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ photmaster ] .",
    "the errors quoted are the quadratic sum of the instrumental magnitude errors from apphot ( shot - noise in the object aperture , sky - noise ) , and the errors in the determination of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in order to compare those radio sources with photographic magnitudes , @xmath33 , to those sources with 4-shooter  gunn magnitudes , @xmath34 , it was necessary to convert one photometric system to another @xcite .",
    "windhorst et  al .",
    "( 1991)derived transformations from the gunn system to the photographic system , and inverting these gives the required equations : @xmath35 for those sources without 4-shooter  observations , the optical magnitudes in table  [ photmaster ] are photographic magnitudes from kron et  al.(1985 ) transformed to the gunn system using these equations .",
    "an error of 0.3 magnitudes is assigned to each of these values , corresponding to the quadratic sum of the error in the transformations ( 0.1  mag ) and the error in the photographic magnitudes ( 0.20.3  mag ) .",
    "for the eighteen sources with both photographic and 4-shooter  gunn photometry , the transformed photographic magnitudes are compared with the 4-shooter  data in fig .",
    "[ gritranscomp ] . it can be seen that the transformations are in good agreement with the data for @xmath3623  mag ; fainter than this , the @xmath33 magnitudes are close to the detection limits of the photographic plates and are less reliable .",
    "infrared data are crucial to understanding high - redshift galaxies . beyond @xmath37 ,",
    "optical observations sample the restframe ultraviolet emission of galaxies and the restframe optical emission has shifted into the near - infrared . thus in order to properly compare sources at high-@xmath38 with those at low-@xmath38",
    ", the analysis must move to longer wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath5-band has long been recognized as a valuable window through which to investigate radio galaxies , and so we sought to obtain @xmath5 magnitudes for the complete hercules sample .",
    "approximately half the sample has been observed during three major observing runs at the 3.8-m uk infrared telescope , mauna kea , hawaii ( table  [ hercukirt ] ) . the first two runs ( 1992 & 1993 ) used the infrared camera ircam , a 62@xmath3958-pixel insb array with a scale of 0.62 arcsec pixel@xmath15 .",
    "all these observations were done in the @xmath5-band .",
    "the 1997 run used the upgraded camera ircam3 , which had 256@xmath39256 pixels with a scale of 0.286 arcsec pixel@xmath15 .",
    "deep @xmath5 images were obtained for sources which had not previously been detected , together with @xmath7-band observations of several galaxies for which @xmath7 was considered important for constraining the redshift .",
    "additional observations of some sources were made during associated projects and via the ukirt service observing programme .",
    "a standard jittering procedure was used to obtain a median - filtered sky flat - field simultaneously with the data .",
    "nine 3-minute exposures were made , each offset by 8  ( 1992 & 1993 ) or 15  ( 1997 ) from the first position , resulting in a central area around the radio source with a maximal exposure time of 27 minutes , surrounded by a border of low signal - to - noise data .",
    "this was repeated two or three times for the faintest sources .",
    "observations of faint standard stars were taken to calibrate the data .",
    "for all three ukirt runs , the image processing stage in the reduction was performed at the telescope by the observers .",
    "this consisted of the following steps : ( i ) a dark frame observed prior to the nine - exposure sequence was subtracted from each image ; ( ii ) a normalised flat - field was constructed by taking the median of the nine exposures ; ( iii ) each exposure was then divided by the flat - field ; ( iv ) an extinction correction was applied ; ( v ) the images were registered and finally combined into a mosaic after rejection of known bad pixels .",
    "the standard star observations were reduced in the same manner , and the instrumental magnitude ( corrected for extinction ) calculated .",
    "comparison with the known apparent magnitude then yielded a zero - point .",
    "standards were observed regularly and the zero - points were found to vary by @xmath40  mag throughout each photometric night .",
    "colour coefficients are small in the infrared and were not determined .",
    "photometry was performed on each of the mosaics using the same method as for the optical data (  3.5 ) , with the exception of the 1992 observations for which the sky background was determined from the mean of @xmath41 circular apertures placed randomly around the source .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ photmaster ] and fig .",

    "discussion of redshift - dependent properties will be presented in paper  ii , following analysis of the new spectroscopic data .      before investigating the photometric properties of the sample as a whole , the optical , infrared & radio observations of some individual sources are worth noting .",

    "comparing the optical and infrared colours recorded in windhorst et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) with those here , shows that they are fully consistent within the errors , although there is some discrepancy between the optical magnitudes .",
    "this may be explained by noting that windhorst  et  al .",
    "use `` total '' magnitudes which are brighter than the 4  aperture magnitudes in table  [ photmaster ]  indeed , application of the same method to these data produces consistent results .",
    "it is important to note that the _ colours _ of faint sources are not significantly affected by aperture size so long as the aperture is larger than the seeing disk , which it is in all cases here .",
    "53w011 & 53w013  there was originally some concern that these two sources may have been confused with the grating rings in the wsrt observations , however both have optical counterparts and so are retained in the sample .",

    "the apparent magnitude distribution is of cosmological interest because it is closely related to the radio source redshift distribution . broadly speaking , the fainter a source is ( in optical / infrared wavebands ) , the more distant it is expected to be . although complicated by evolutionary effects , in the absence of spectroscopic data the magnitude distribution has been an important tool in studying radio galaxies .",

    "i.e.  the faintest radio sources are not in general the faintest sources at optical / infrared wavelengths .",
    "this would suggest that the faintest radio sources are lower ( radio ) luminosity objects at lower redshift , rather than radio - powerful objects at high redshift .",

    "the lbds galaxies are seen here to have much the same distribution as the 1-jansky and psr galaxies .",
    "the median @xmath5 magnitudes for the four samples are 15.3 ( 3cr ) , 16.5 ( 1-jy ) , 16.5 ( psr ) and 16.8 ( lbds ) . to the extent that the @xmath5 magnitude of a powerful radio galaxy is a good estimator of its redshift",

    "this may suggest that the quasar population is not changing as rapidly as the radio galaxy population .",
