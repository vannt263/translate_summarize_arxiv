    "synchronization of neural activity appears in different parts of the mammalian cerebral cortex @xcite , and underlies different neural processes in both normal and anomalous brain functions @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that synchronization plays a vital role in information processing in the brain , e.g. , processing information from different sensory systems to form a coherent and unified perception of the external world @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "synchronization has been detected in pathological conditions such as parkinson s disease @xcite . and",
    "epileptic seizures have long been considered resulting from excessive synchronized brain activity @xcite , though some recent studies suggest that this picture may be an over - simplification @xcite .",
    "therefore understanding the mechanisms of synchronization may be a critical step in elucidating how neural systems work @xcite .",
    "it has stimulated a great deal of theoretical and numerical works , such as the studies on the effects of the topological properties of underlying networks @xcite and the dynamical properties of synaptic coupling @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the response time of synaptic couplings influences the stability of synchronized oscillation in the nonlocally coupled hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) equations @xcite . if the response time of synaptic coupling is slower , synchronized activity of the systems is instable for excitatory coupling . however , the underlying dynamical mechanism of the influence is not clear . in experimental studies @xcite ,",
    "it has been suggested that the generation of prolonged epileptiform neuronal synchronization is favored by lower efficacy of synaptic transmission .",
    "the numerical studies @xcite in a detailed computational model revealed that seizure - like activity occurs when the excitatory synapses are weakened , and the results were confirmed experimentally in mouse neocortical slices . according to the common accepted assumption",
    "that synchronization of neuronal activity underlies seizures , the dynamical mechanism of synchronization may be useful for understanding the way the biological neural system works .",
    "in this work , we numerically investigated the dynamical mechanism underlying the influence of synaptic efficacy on firing synchronization in hh neuron networks . to do this , we first studied the dynamics of the response of hh neuron to excitatory synaptic current . when the efficacy of synapse is low , namely , strength is weak and duration is short , the limit cycle is stable to the perturbation of the synaptic current .",
    "when synaptic efficacy is high , synaptic current can induce the transition of the neurons from limit cycle to fixed point or transient state .",
    "the transition is determined by dynamics of neuron s ionic channel .",
    "the decrease of synaptic current depresses the feedback of sodium ionic current which is responsible for the initiation of the spike . for simplicity",
    "we will refer to the transitions as spike death .    in neuronal networks ,",
    "synaptic input of a neuron is the accumulation of the currents received from all presynaptic neurons .",
    "when the coherence of firing time of neurons is enhanced by the excitatory interaction , the synaptic input of neurons transforms from the fluctuating waveform into the pulse shape like the signal produced by one synapse .",
    "if synaptic efficacy is high , the input signal can induce spike death of the neuron .",
    "then spike death disorders the adjustment of the rhythm of neurons and prevents neurons from firing spikes synchronously .",
    "in contrast , for synapses of lower efficacy , the duration of synaptic current is too short to induce spike death of neurons .",
    "additionally , the firing synchronization is different from synchronous activity of oscillators for the existence of the transitions of neuron s state .",

    "so the positive feedback is weakened .",
    "if the current decreases quickly , the spike of neuron can be depressed .",
    "therefore , for depressing the positive feedback of sodium ionic current , the decrease of current must occur at the onset of generation of spike , and the current must decrease in a large rate .",

    "collective behaviors sensitively depend on the intrinsic dynamics of neurons @xcite , and many types of response of neuron to synaptic coupling may exist @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to make further studies on the relations among different responses and their effects on the collective behaviors of networks .",
    "the variability of strength of synapses was not involved in the present investigation .",
    "the synaptic strength is often affected by the activity of neurons through synaptic plasticity @xcite and synaptic adaption @xcite .",
    "the effect of changes of synaptic strength will be studied elsewhere .",
    "as mentioned above , the phenomena that low efficacy of synapses favors the generation of neuronal synchronization underlying seizure were obtained in experiments and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "here we equated the strength and especially the characteristic time of synapses to the synaptic efficacy , and studied the mechanism by which synapses influence firing synchronization .",
    "the mechanism of the influence may have potentially values for understanding the way the realistic neural system works .",
