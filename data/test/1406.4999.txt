    "in particle physics , the neutrino plays a remarkable role of a `` tiny '' particle .",
    "the scale of neutrino mass @xmath0 is much lower than that of the charged fermions ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "interaction of neutrinos with matter is extremely weak as compared to that in the case of other known elementary fermions .",
    "according to the standard model ( sm ) , it can be mediated only via exchange of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons .",
    "however , the recent development of our knowledge of neutrino mixing and oscillations , supported by the discovery of flavor conversions of neutrinos from different sources ( see  @xcite ) , substantiates the assumption that neutrinos can possess electromagnetic properties and , hence , take part in electromagentic interactions ( see , for instance , the review articles  @xcite ) .",
    "these properties include , in particular , the electric charge , the charge radius , the anapole moment , and the dipole electric and magnetic moments .",
    "such nontypical neutrino features are of particular interest , because they open a door to `` new physics '' beyond the sm ( bsm ) . in spite of appreciable efforts in searches for neutrino electromagnetic characteristics , up to now",
    "there is no experimental evidence favoring their nonvanishing values .    among the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos ,",
    "the most studied and well understood theoretically are neutrino magnetic moments ( nmm ) , along with electric dipole moments .",
    "for the most recent and complete review on theoretical and experimental aspects of nmm , as well as for the corresponding references , see  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian , which describes the coupling of nmm to the electromagnetic field @xmath5 , can be written in the form @xmath6 where the magnetic moments @xmath7 , in the presence of mixing between different neutrino states , are associated with the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath8 .",
    "an interplay between the magnetic moment and neutrino mixing effects is important .",
    "note that the electric ( transition ) moments @xmath9 do also contribute to the coupling .",
    "a dirac neutrino may have non - zero diagonal electric moments in models where cp invariance is violated . for a majorana neutrino",
    "the diagonal magnetic and electric moments are zero .",
    "therefore , nmm can be used to distinguish dirac and majorana neutrinos @xcite .    in the standard model",
    "the magnetic moment of a massless neutrino is zero . in the minimal extension of the sm , the explicit evaluation of the one - loop contributions to the dirac nmm in the leading approximation over small parameters @xmath10 ( @xmath11 are the neutrino masses , @xmath12 ) , that however exactly accounts for the parameters @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) ,",

    "the obtained value for nmm is proportional to the neutrino mass and is , in general , of the order @xmath20 .",
    "much larger values for nmm can be obtained in different other sm extensions ( see @xcite for the detailed discussion ) . however , there is a problem @xcite for any bsm theory how to get a large nmm value and simultaneously to avoid an unacceptable large contribution to the neutrino mass .",
    "recently this problem has been reconsidered for a class of bsm theories and it has been shown in a model - independent way that in principle it is possible to avoid the above mentioned contradiction in the case of dirac @xcite and majorana @xcite neutrinos . it has been shown that in this kind of theoretical models the nmm can naturally reach values of @xmath21 .",
    "these values are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the present laboratory experimental limits ( see bellow ) .",
    "there is also a huge gap of many orders of magnitude between these values and the prediction of the minimal extension of the sm .",
    "therefore , if any direct experimental confirmation of non - zero nmm is obtained in the laboratory experiments , it will open a window to `` new physics '' .",
    "the neutrino magnetic moments are being searched in reactor  @xcite , accelerator  @xcite and solar  @xcite experiments on low - energy elastic neutrino - electron scattering ( for more details see the review articles  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the current best upper limit on the nmm value obtained in such direct laboratory measurements is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a bohr magneton .",
    "this bound , which is due to the gemma experiment  @xcite with a hpge detector at kalinin nuclear power station , is by an order of magnitude larger than the tightest constraint obtained in astrophysics  @xcite : @xmath24 and it by many orders of magnitude exceeds the value derived in the minimally extended sm that includes right - handed neutrinos  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath0 is a neutrino mass . at the same time",
    ", there are different theoretical bsm scenarios that predict much higher @xmath26 values .",
    "for example , the effective nmm value in a class of extra - dimension models can be as large as about @xmath27  @xcite .",

    "for antineutrinos one must substitute @xmath43 .",
    "the possibility for neutrino - electron elastic scattering due to nmm was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the cross section of this process was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the related brief historical notes can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we would like to recall the paper by domogatsky and nadezhin  @xcite , where the cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite was corrected and the antineutrino - electron cross section was considered in the context of the earlier experiments with reactor antineutrinos of cowan and reines  @xcite and cowan et al .",
    "@xcite , which were aimed to reveal the nmm effects .",
    "discussions on the derivation of the cross section and on the optimal conditions for bounding the nmm value , as well as a collection of the cross section formulas for elastic scattering of neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) on electrons , nucleons , and nuclei , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the result relevant to the @xmath26 component in eq .",
    "( [ cr_sec ] ) reads  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "thus , the two components of the cross section  ( [ cr_sec ] ) exhibit qualitatively different dependencies on the recoil - electron kinetic energy @xmath28 .",
    "namely , at low @xmath28 values the sm cross section is practically constant in @xmath28 , while that due to @xmath26 behaves as @xmath46 .",
    "this means that the experimental sensitivity to nmm value critically depends on lowering the energy threshold of the detector employed for measurement of the recoil - electron spectrum .",
    "the current reactor experiments with germanium detectors  @xcite have reached threshold values of @xmath28 as low as few kev and are to further improve the sensitivity to low energy deposition in the detector  @xcite . at low energies , however",
    ", one can expect a modification of the free - electron formulas due to the binding of electrons in the germanium atoms , where e.g. the energy of the @xmath47 line , 9.89kev , indicates that at least some of the atomic binding energies are comparable to the already relevant to the experiment values of @xmath28 .",
    "thus a proper treatment of the atomic effects in neutrino scattering is necessary and important for the analysis of the current and , even more , of the future data with a still lower threshold .",
    "furthermore , there is no known means of independently calibrating experimentally the response of atomic systems , such as the germanium , to the scattering due to the interactions relevant for the neutrino experiments .",
    "therefore one has to rely on a pure theoretical analysis in interpreting the neutrino data .",
    "for the first time this problem was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a 2 - 3 times enhancement of the electroweak cross section in the case of ionization from a 1@xmath48 state of a hydrogen - like atom with nuclear charge @xmath49 had been numerically determined at neutrino energies @xmath50 .",
    "subsequent numerical calculations within the relativistic hartree - fock method for ionization from inner shells of various atoms showed much lower enhancement ( @xmath51 ) of the electroweak contribution  @xcite .",
    "it was found that in the scattering on realistic atoms , such as germanium , the so - called stepping approximation works with a very good accuracy .",
    "the stepping approach , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite from an interpretation of numerical data , treats the process as scattering on individual independent electrons occupying atomic orbitals and suggests that the cross section follows the free - electron behavior in eqs .",
    "( [ cr_sec_sm ] ) and ( [ cr_sec_mu ] ) down to @xmath28 equal to the ionization threshold for the orbital , and that below that energy the electron on the corresponding orbital is ` deactivated ' thus producing a sharp ` step ' in the dependence of the cross section on @xmath28 .",
    "the interest to the role of atomic effects was renewed in several more recent papers .",
    "the early claim  @xcite of a significant enhancement of the nmm contribution in the case of germanium due to the atomic effects has been later disproved  @xcite and it was argued  @xcite that the modification of the free - electron formulas ( [ cr_sec_sm ] ) and ( [ cr_sec_mu ] ) by the atomic - binding effects is insignificant down to very low values of @xmath28 .",
    "this conclusion appeared to be also in contradiction with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was deduced by means of numerical calculations that the @xmath26 contribution to ionization of the helium atomic target by impact of electron antineutrinos strongly enhances relative to the free - electron approximation .",
    "however , from calculations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite it follows that the stepping approximation is well applicable practically down to the ionization threshold for helium .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the most sensitive and widely used method for the experimental investigation of the neutrino electromagnetic properties is provided by direct laboratory measurements of low - energy elastic scattering of neutrinos and antineutrinos with electrons in reactor , accelerator and solar experiments . in this section",
    "we deliver a theoretical background for such studies .",
