    "methods developed for it should be helpful in other dense quantum fluids such as liquid helium ( pandharipande & wiringa  @xcite ) .    the starting point for any nuclear matter calculation is a two - body potential that models the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( pandharipande & wiringa  @xcite ) .",
    "the first nuclear matter calculations were done by euler  ( @xcite ) .",

    "generally the above potentials are limited to a few operators and do nt fit the data for all the scattering channels very well . in many - body calculations of nuclei and nuclear matter , it is suitable to represent the two nucleon interaction as an operator ( lagaris & pandharipande  @xcite ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are functions of the interparticle distance @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are suitably chosen operators . the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath29 ) interaction scattering data uniquely show the occurrence of terms belonging to the eight operators ( lagaris & pandharipande  @xcite ) : @xmath30 in the @xmath31 .",

    "a phenomenologically two - nucleon interaction potential was introduced by lagaris and pandharipande  ( @xcite ) .",

    ", we use the lowest - order constrained variational method ( locv ) to calculate the correlation function of the nuclear matter .",
    "primarily , the technique of locv was used to study the bulk properties of quantal fluids ( owen et al .",
    "@xcite ; modarres & irvine  @xcite ) .",
    "the method was later extended to calculate the symmetry coefficient for the semi - empirical mass formula ( howes et al .",

    "these calculations have been extended in the presence of magnetic field for the spin polarized neutron matter at zero temperature ( bordbar et al .",
    "the locv method is a fully self - consistent formalism and it does not bring any free parameter into the calculation .",
    "it considers the normalization constraint to keep the higher order terms as small as possible .",
    "the functional minimization procedure represents an enormous computational simplification over unconstrained methods ( i.e. , to parameterize the short - range behavior of correlation functions ) that attempts to go beyond the lowest order ( bordbar & modarres  @xcite ) .    in the present work ,",

    "the same as for the case of correlation function , this distance represents the hard core of the nuclear potential . from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , it can be seen that the value of @xmath140 increases as the internucleon distance increases and finally approaches to unity , approximately at @xmath144 . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , we have plotted the pair distribution function of asymmetrical nuclear matter employing @xmath0 potential at different values of proton to neutron ratio ( @xmath139 ) for @xmath135 and different isospin channels ( @xmath56 , @xmath52 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "we can see that at all channels , by increasing @xmath139 , the pair distribution function decreases , corresponding to decreasing of the correlation .",
    "besides , from fig . [ f6 ] , it can be seen that for each @xmath139 , the pair distribution functions of @xmath56 and @xmath54 channels have identical behaviors , while at @xmath52 channel , @xmath140 , behaves differently compared to the other two channels .",
    "these are corresponding to the behavior of correlation function at these channels .      in fig .",

    "there is an overall agreement between our results and those of others calculated with the @xmath141 potential ( modarres  @xcite ) . from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , it is seen that the nucleon - nucleon interaction leads to the reduction of the structure function of nuclear matter with respect to that of the non - interacting @xmath146 @xmath147 system . in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , we have plotted the structure function of asymmetrical nuclear matter with @xmath0 potential at different isospin channels ( @xmath56 , @xmath52 , @xmath54 ) for different values of proton to neutron ratio ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath135 .",
    "it is seen that similar to the pair distribution function , the structure function of @xmath56 channel is like that of the @xmath54 channel , especially at higher values of @xmath145 .",
    "we have found that this similarity becomes more clear as @xmath139 increases .",
    "however , there is a substantial difference between structure functions of @xmath52 channel and @xmath54 and @xmath56 channels .",
    "using the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) method , we have computed the correlation function , the pair distribution function and the structure function of the symmetrical and asymmetrical nuclear matter . in order to investigate the effect of nucleon - nucleon interaction on the properties of nuclear matter , we have also computed the pair distribution function and the structure function of noninteracting _",

    "it was seen that the nucleon - nucleon interaction leads to the reduction of the structure function of nuclear matter with respect to that of the non - interacting _ fermi gas _ system .",
    "we have found that at @xmath52 and @xmath54 channels , the correlation length decreases as the proton to neutron ratio ( @xmath148 increases , while at @xmath56 channel , by increasing @xmath139 , the correlation length increases . however , the behavior of the pair distribution function at @xmath52 channel is considerably different pair from those of other two channels .",
    "this is due to the difference between the behavior of correlation functions of these channels .",
    "it was indicated that for higher @xmath145 and @xmath139 , the structure functions of @xmath56 and @xmath54 channels are identical , corresponding to the similarity between the pair distribution functions of these channels .",
