    "event shape variables are perhaps the most popular observables for testing qcd and for improving our understanding of its dynamics .",
    "event shape studies began in earnest towards the late seventies as a simple quantitative method to understand the nature of gluon bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was on the basis of comparisons to event shape data that one could first deduce that gluons were vector particles , since theoretical predictions employing scalar gluons did not agree with experiment  @xcite .",
    "quite generally , event shapes parametrise the geometrical properties of the energy - momentum flow of an event and their values are therefore directly related to the appearance of an event in the detector . in other words the value of a given event shape encodes in a continuous fashion , for example , the transition from pencil - like two - jet events with hadron flow prominently distributed along some axis , to planar three - jet events or events with a spherical distribution of hadron momenta .",
    "thus they provide more detailed information on the final state geometry than say a jet finding algorithm which would always classify an event as having a certain finite number of jets , even if the actual energy flow is uniformly distributed in the detector and there is no prominent jet structure present in the first place .",
    "event shapes are well suited to testing qcd mainly because , by construction , they are collinear and infrared safe observables .",
    "this means that one can safely compute them in perturbation theory and use the predictions as a means of extracting the strong coupling @xmath1 .",
    "they are also well suited for determinations of other parameters of the theory such as constraining the quark and gluon colour factors as well as the qcd beta function .",
    "additionally they have also been used in other studies for characterising the final state , such as investigations of jet and heavy quark multiplicities as functions of event shape variables  @xcite .    aside from testing the basic properties of qcd , event shape distributions are a powerful probe of our more detailed knowledge of qcd dynamics .",
    "all the commonly studied event shape variables have the property that in the region where the event shape value is small , one is sensitive primarily to gluon emission that is soft compared to the hard scale of the event and/or collinear to one of the hard partons .",
    "such small - transverse - momentum emissions have relatively large emission probabilities ( compared to their high transverse momentum counterparts ) due to logarithmic soft - collinear dynamical enhancements as well as the larger value of their coupling to the hard partons .",
    "predictions for event shape distributions therefore typically contain large logarithms in the region where the event - shape is small , which are a reflection of the importance of multiple soft and/or collinear emission . a successful prediction for an event shape in this region",
    "requires all - order resummed perturbative predictions or the use of a monte - carlo event generator , which contains correctly the appropriate dynamics governing multiple particle production .",
    "comparisons of these predictions to experimental data are therefore a stringent test of the understanding qcd dynamics that has been reached so far .",
    "one other feature of event shapes , that at first appeared as an obstacle to their use in extracting the fundamental parameters of qcd , is the presence of significant non - perturbative effects in the form of power corrections that vary as an inverse power of the hard scale , @xmath2 . for most event shapes ,",
    "phenomenologically it was found that @xmath3 ( as discussed in  @xcite ) , and the resulting non - perturbative effects can be of comparable size to next - to - leading order perturbative predictions , as we shall discuss presently .",
    "the problem however , can be handled to a large extent by hadronisation models embedded in monte - carlo event generators @xcite , which model the conversion of partons into hadrons at the cost of introducing several parameters that need to be tuned to the data .",
    "once this is done , application of such hadronisation models leads to very successful comparisons of perturbative predictions with experimental data with , for example , values of @xmath1 consistent to those obtained from other methods and with relatively small errors .",
    "however since the mid - nineties attempts have also been made to obtain a better insight into the physics of hadronisation and power corrections in particular .",
    "theoretical models such as those based on renormalons have been developed to probe the non - perturbative domain that gives rise to power corrections ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "since the power corrections are relatively large effects for event shape variables , scaling typically as @xmath4 ( no other class of observable shows such large effects ) , event shapes have become the most widely used means of investigating the validity of these ideas . in fact an entire phenomenology of event shapes has developed which is based on accounting for non - perturbative effects via such theoretically inspired models , and including them in fits to event shape data alongside the extraction of other standard qcd parameters . in this way",
    "event shapes also serve as a tool for understanding more quantitatively the role of confinement effects .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in the following section we list the definitions of several commonly studied event shapes in @xmath5 annihilation and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and discuss briefly some of their properties .",
    "then in section  [ sec : perturbative ] we review the state of the art for perturbative predictions of event - shape mean values and distributions .",
    "in particular , we examine the need for resummed predictions for distributions and clarify the nomenclature and notation used in that context , as well as the problem of matching these predictions to fixed order computations .",
    "we then turn , in sections  [ sec : exp ] and [ sec : distributions ] , to comparisons with experimental data and the issue of non - perturbative corrections , required in order to be able to apply parton level calculations to hadronic final state data .",
    "we discuss the various approaches used to estimate non - perturbative corrections , ranging from phenomenological hadronisation models to analytical approaches based on renormalons , and shape - functions .",
    "we also discuss methods where the standard perturbative results are modified by use of renormalisation group improvements or the use of ` dressed gluons ' .",
    "we study fits to event shape data , from different sources , in both @xmath5 annihilation and dis and compare the various approaches that are adopted to make theoretical predictions .",
    "in addition we display some of the results obtained by fitting data for various event shape variables for parameters such as the strong coupling , the qcd colour factors and the qcd beta function .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : outlook ] , we present an outlook on possible future developments in the field .",
    "we list here the most widely studied event shapes , concentrating on those that have received significant experimental and theoretical attention .      _",
    "the _ canonical event shape is the thrust  @xcite , @xmath6 : @xmath7 where the numerator is maximised over directions of the unit vector @xmath8 and the sum is over all final - state hadron momenta @xmath9 ( whose three - vectors are @xmath10 and energies @xmath11 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 is known as the thrust axis . in the limit of two narrow back - to - back jets @xmath12 , while its minimum value of @xmath13 corresponds to events with a uniform distribution of momentum flow in all directions .",
    "the infrared and collinear safety of the thrust ( and other event shapes ) is an essential consequence of its linearity in momenta .",
    "often it is @xmath14 ( also called @xmath15 ) that is referred to insofar as it is this that vanishes in the @xmath16-jet limit .",
    "a number of other commonly studied event shapes are constructed employing the thrust axis . amongst these",
    "are the invariant squared jet - mass  @xcite and the jet - broadening variables  @xcite , defined respectively as @xmath17 where the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis is used to separate the event into left and right hemisphere , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . given these definitions one can study the heavy - jet mass , @xmath20 and wide - jet broadening , @xmath21 ; analogously one defines the light - jet mass ( @xmath22 ) and narrow - jet broadening @xmath23 ; finally one defines also the sum of jet masses @xmath24 and the total jet broadening @xmath25 and their differences @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . like @xmath14 ,",
    "all these variables ( and those that follow ) vanish in the two - jet limit ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are special in that they also vanish in the limit of three narrow jets ( three final - state partons ; or in general for events with any number of jets in the heavy hemisphere , but only one in the light hemisphere ) .",
    "another set of observables @xcite making use of the thrust axis starts with the thrust major @xmath28 , @xmath29 where the maximisation is performed over all directions of the unit vector @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 .",
    "the thrust minor , @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 and is sometimes also known @xcite as the ( normalised ) out - of - plane momentum @xmath34 .",
    "like @xmath22 and @xmath23 , it vanishes in the three - jet limit ( and , in general , for planar events ) .",
    "finally from @xmath28 and @xmath32 one constructs the oblateness , @xmath35 .",
    "an alternative axis is used for the spherocity @xmath36  @xcite , @xmath37 while there exist reliable ( though algorithmically slow ) methods of determining the thrust and thrust minor axes , the general properties of the spherocity axis are less well understood and consequently the spherocity has received less theoretical attention .",
    "an observable similar to the thrust minor ( in that it measures out - of - plane momentum ) , but defined in a manner analogous to the spherocity is the acoplanarity  @xcite , which minimises a ( squared ) projection perpendicular to a plane .",
    "it is also possible to define event shapes without reference to an explicit axis .",
    "the best known examples are the @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameters @xcite which are obtained from the momentum tensor @xcite . because of the quadratic dependence on particle momenta , these observable are collinear unsafe and so no longer widely studied . ]",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 component of the three vector @xmath43 . in terms of the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath47 , the @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameters are given by @xmath48 the @xmath38-parameter is related also to one of a series of fox - wolfram observables  @xcite , @xmath49 , and is sometimes equivalently written as @xmath50 the @xmath39-parameter , like the thrust minor , vanishes for all final - states with up to 3 particles , and in general , for planar events",
    ".    the @xmath38-parameter can actually be considered ( in the limit of all particles being massless ) as the integral of a more differential observable , the energy - energy correlation ( eec ) @xcite , @xmath51 where the average in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmachi ] ) is carried out over all events .",
    "another set of variables that characterise the shape of the final state are the @xmath52-jet resolution parameters that are generated by jet finding algorithms .",
    "examples of these are the jade  @xcite and durham  @xcite jet clustering algorithms .",
    "one introduces distance measures @xmath53 @xmath54 for each pair of particles @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the pair with the smallest @xmath53 is clustered ( by adding the four - momenta  the @xmath57 recombination scheme ) and replaced with a single pseudo - particle ; the @xmath53 are recalculated and the combination procedure repeated until all remaining @xmath53 are larger than some value @xmath58 .",
    "the event - shapes based on these jet algorithms are @xmath59 , defined as the maximum value of @xmath58 for which the event is clustered to 3 jets ; analogously one can define @xmath60 , and so forth . other clustering jet algorithms exist .",
    "most differ essentially in the definition of the distance measure @xmath53 and the recombination procedure .",
    "for example , there are e0 , p and p0 variants  @xcite of the jade algorithm , which differ in the details of the treatment of the difference between energy and the modulus of the 3-momentum .",
    "the geneva algorithm  @xcite is like the jade algorithm except that in the definition of the @xmath53 it is @xmath61 that appears in the denominator instead of the total energy .",
    "an algorithm that has been developed and adopted recently is the cambridge algorithm  @xcite , which uses the same distance measure as the durham algorithm , but with a different clustering sequence .",
    "we note that a number of variants of the above observables have recently been introduced  @xcite , which differ in their treatment of massive particles .",
    "these include the @xmath62-scheme where all occurrences of @xmath11 are replaced by @xmath63 and the @xmath57-scheme where each 3-momentum @xmath43 is rescaled by @xmath64 .",
    "the former leads to a difference between the total energy in the initial and final states , while the latter leads to a final - state with potentially non - zero overall @xmath65-momentum .",
    "while such schemes do have these small drawbacks , for certain observables , notably the jet masses , which are quite sensitive to the masses of the hadrons ( seldom identified in experimental event - shape studies ) , they tend to be both theoretically and experimentally cleaner . ref .",
    "@xcite also introduced a ` decay ' scheme ( an alternative is given in  @xcite ) where all hadrons are artificially decayed to massless particles . since a decay is by definition a stochastic process , this does not give a unique result on an event - by - event basis , but should rather be understood as providing a correction factor which is to be averaged over a large ensemble of events .",
    "it is to be kept in mind that these different schemes all lead to identical perturbative predictions ( with massless quarks ) and differ only at the non - perturbative level .",
    "a final question relating to event - shape definitions concerns the hadron level at which measurements are made .",
    "since shorter lived hadrons decay during the time of flight , one has to specify whether measurements were made at a stage before or after a given species of hadron decays .",
    "it is important therefore when experimental results are quoted , that they should specify which particles have been taken to be stable and which have not .      as well as",
    "the @xmath66 variables discussed above , it is also possible to define , by analogy , event shapes in dis .",
    "the frame in which dis event shapes can be made to most closely resemble those of @xmath66 is the breit frame @xcite .",
    "this is the frame in which @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the incoming proton momentum and @xmath69 the virtual photon momentum .",
    "one defines two hemispheres , separated by the plane normal to the photon direction : the remnant hemisphere ( @xmath70 , containing the proton remnant ) , and the current hemisphere ( @xmath71 ) . at the level of the quark - parton model , @xmath71 is like one hemisphere of @xmath0 and it is therefore natural to define event shapes using only the momenta in this hemisphere . in contrast ,",
    "any observable involving momenta in the remnant hemisphere must take care to limit its sensitivity to the proton remnant , whose fragmentation can not be reliably handled within perturbation theory .",
    "a possible alternative to studying just the current hemisphere , is to take all particles except those in a small cone around the proton direction  @xcite .    a feature that arises in dis",
    "is that there are two natural choices of axis .",
    "for example , for the thrust @xmath72 one can either choose the unit vector @xmath73 to be the photon ( @xmath74 ) axis , @xmath75 , or one can choose it to be the true thrust axis , that which maximises the sum , giving @xmath76 .",
    "similarly one defines two variants of the jet broadening , @xmath77 for the jet - mass and @xmath38-parameter the choice of axis does not enter into the definitions and we have @xmath78 all the above observables can also be defined with an alternative normalisation , @xmath79 replacing @xmath80 , in which case they are named @xmath81 and so on .",
    "we note that @xmath81 was originally proposed in  @xcite . for a reader used to @xmath0 event",
    "shapes the two normalisations might at first sight seem equivalent  however when considering a single hemisphere , as in dis , the equivalence is lost , and indeed there are even events in which the current hemisphere is empty .",
    "this is a problem for observables normalised to the sum of energies in @xmath71 , to the extent that to ensure infrared safety it is necessary to exclude all events in which the energy present in the current hemisphere is smaller than some not too small fraction of @xmath82 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "additionally there are studies of variables that vanish in the 2 + 1-parton limit for dis , in particular the @xmath34 defined in analogy with the thrust minor of @xmath0 , with the thrust axis replaced by the photon axis @xcite , or an azimuthal correlation observable  @xcite . rather than being examined just in @xmath71 ,",
    "these observables use particles also in the remnant hemisphere ( for @xmath34 , all except those in a small cone around the proton ) .    as in @xmath0 ,",
    "jet rates are studied also in dis . unlike the event - shapes described above",
    ", the jet - shapes make use of the momenta in both hemispheres of the breit frame .",
    "their definitions are quite similar to those of @xmath0 except that a clustering to the proton remnant ( beam jet ) is also included  @xcite .",
    "though only @xmath0 and dis are within the scope of this review , we take the opportunity here to note that related observables are being considered also for other processes .",
    "notably for drell - yan production an out - of - plane momentum measurement has been proposed in  @xcite and various thrust and thrust - minor type observables have been considered in hadron - hadron dijet production in  @xcite .",
    "the observables discussed above are all infrared and collinear safe  they do not change their value when an extra soft gluon is added or if a parton is split into two collinear partons . as emerges from the original discussion of sterman and weinberg  @xcite , this is a necessary condition for the cancellation of real and virtual divergences associated with such emissions , and therefore for making finite perturbative predictions .    for an event shape that vanishes in the @xmath52-jet limit ( which we shall generically refer as an @xmath52-jet observable ) , the leading perturbative contribution is of order @xmath83 . for example",
    "the thrust distribution in @xmath0 is given by @xmath84 + { { \\cal o}\\left({\\alpha_s}^2\\right ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "when calculating perturbative predictions for mean values of event shapes , as well as higher moments of their distributions , one has integrals of the form @xmath85 we note that in general , fixed - order event - shape distributions diverge in the limit as @xmath86 goes to @xmath87 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : thrustdist ] ) for @xmath88 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanv ] ) , the weighting with a power of @xmath86 is sufficient to render the singularity integrable , and the integral is dominated by large @xmath86 ( and so large transverse momenta of order @xmath82 , the hard scale ) .",
    "this dominance of a single scale ensures that the coefficients in the perturbative expansion for @xmath89 are well - behaved ( for example they are free of any enhancements associated with logarithms of ratios of disparate scales ) .    beyond leading order ,",
    "perturbative calculations involve complex cancellations between soft and collinear real and virtual contributions and are nearly always left to general - purpose `` fixed - order monte carlo '' programs .",
    "the current state of the art is next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and available programs include : for @xmath0 to 3 jets , event  @xcite , eerad  @xcite and event2 @xcite ; for @xmath0 to 4 jets , menlo parc  @xcite , mercutio @xcite and eerad2  @xcite ; for dis to @xmath90 jets , mepjet  @xcite , disent  @xcite and disaster++ @xcite ; and for all the above processes and additionally dis to @xmath91 jets and various hadron - hadron and photo - production processes , nlojet++  @xcite ( for photo - production , there is additionally jetvip  @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "much progress has been made towards nnlo calculations , though complete results remain to be obtained ( for a review of the current situation , see @xcite ) .",
    "for the event shape distributions themselves , however , fixed order perturbative estimates are only of use away from the @xmath92 region , due to the singular behaviour of the fixed order coefficients in the @xmath93 limit . in this limit , at higher orders each power of @xmath94 is accompanied by a coefficient which grows as @xmath95 .",
    "these problems arise because when @xmath86 is small one places a restriction on real emissions without any corresponding restriction on virtual contributions  the resulting incompleteness of cancellations between logarithmically divergent real and virtual contributions is the origin of the order - by - order logarithmic enhancement of the perturbative contributions . to obtain a meaningful answer",
    "it is therefore necessary to perform an all - orders _ resummation _ of logarithmically enhanced terms .      when discussing resummations it is convenient to refer to the integrated distribution , @xmath96 quite generally @xmath97 has a perturbative expansion of the form @xmath98 one convention is to refer to all terms @xmath99 as leading logarithms ( ll ) , terms @xmath100 as next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) , etc . ,",
    "and within this hierarchy a resummation may account for all ll terms , or all ll and nll terms and so forth .",
    "such a resummation gives a convergent answer up to values of @xmath101 , beyond which terms that are formally subleading can become as important as the leading terms ( for example if @xmath102 , then the nnll term @xmath103 is of the same order as the ll term @xmath104 ) . at its limit of validity , @xmath105 , a n@xmath106ll resummation neglects terms of relative accuracy @xmath107 .",
    "an important point though is that for nearly all observables that have been resummed there exists a property of exponentiation : @xmath108 in some cases @xmath109 is written in terms of a sum of such exponentiated contributions ; in certain other cases the exponentiation holds only for a suitable integral ( e.g.  fourier ) transform of the observable .",
    "the fundamental point of exponentiation is that the inner sum , over @xmath110 , now runs only up to @xmath111 , instead of @xmath112 as was the case in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dumbsum ] ) . with the exponentiated form for the resummation , the nomenclature `` ( next - to)-leading - logarithmic '' acquires a different meaning",
    " n@xmath106ll now refers to all terms in the exponent @xmath113 . to distinguish the two classification schemes we refer to them as n@xmath106ll@xmath114 and n@xmath106ll@xmath115 .",
    "the crucial difference between n@xmath106ll@xmath114 and n@xmath106ll@xmath115 resummations lies in the range of validity and their accuracy .",
    "a n@xmath106ll@xmath115 resummation remains convergent considerably further in @xmath116 , up to @xmath102 ( corresponding usually to the peak of the distribution @xmath117 ) ; at this limit , neglected terms are of relative order @xmath118 .",
    "consequently a n@xmath106ll@xmath115 resummation includes not only all n@xmath106ll@xmath114 terms , but also considerably more .",
    "from now when we use the term n@xmath106ll it should be taken to mean n@xmath106ll@xmath119 .",
    "two main ingredients are involved in the resummations as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expresum ] ) .",
    "firstly one needs to find a way of writing the observable as a factorised expression of terms for individual emissions .",
    "this is often achieved with the aid of one or more integral ( mellin , fourier ) transforms .",
    "secondly one approximates the multi - emission matrix element as a product of individual independent emission factors .",
    "it is to be kept in mind that not all observables exponentiate .",
    "the jade jet resolution is the best known such example  @xcite ( and it has not yet been resummed ) .",
    "the general criteria for exponentiation are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "resummed results to nll accuracy exist for a number of @xmath16-jet observables in @xmath120 jets : the thrust  @xcite , the heavy - jet mass  @xcite and the single - jet and light - jet masses @xcite , jet broadenings @xcite , @xmath38-parameter  @xcite , durham and cambridge jet resolutions @xcite , the thrust major and oblateness @xcite , eec  @xcite and event - shape / energy - flow correlations  @xcite ; for @xmath65-jet observables in @xmath121 jet events we have the thrust minor  @xcite and the @xmath39-parameter @xcite .",

    "we also note that for the @xmath0 thrust and heavy - jet mass there have been investigations of certain classes of corrections beyond nll accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the above resummations all apply to events with only light quarks .",
    "investigations to nll@xmath123 accuracy have also been performed for @xmath0 jet rates with heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "the above resummations are all for @xmath52-jet observables in the @xmath52-jet limit .",
    "for some @xmath65-jet observables it is useful to have resummations in the @xmath16-jet limit ( because it is here that most of the data lie ) , though currently little attention has been devoted to such resummations , with just nll@xmath123 results for jet - resolution parameters @xcite and nll@xmath115 results for the light - jet mass and narrow - jet broadening  @xcite .",
    "furthermore in addition to the resummation of the @xmath38-parameter for @xmath124 there exists a ll resummation  @xcite ( that could straightforward be extended to nll ) of a ` shoulder ' structure at @xmath125 ( related to a step function at lo ) , which corresponds to symmetric three jet events .",
    "some of the observables ( for example many single - jet observables ) have the property that they are sensitive to emissions only in some of the phase space .",
    "these are referred to as non - global observables and nll resummed predictions for them require that one account for coherent ensembles of energy - ordered large - angle gluons .",
    "this has so far been done only in the large-@xmath126 limit  @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) , though progress is being made in extending this to finite @xmath126  @xcite .     at @xmath127 .",
    "the resummed distribution has been matched ( @xmath128 scheme , see below ) so as to include the full lo and nlo contributions .",
    "the inset differs from the main plot only in the scales.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to illustrate the impact of resummations we show in figure  [ fig : thrlonlo ] the lo , nlo and resummed results for the thrust distribution .",
    "not only is the divergence in the lo distribution clearly visible , but one also observes a marked difference in the qualitative behaviour of the lo and nlo results , both of which show large differences relative to the nll resummed prediction at small @xmath14 .    for the practical use of resummed results an important step",
    "is that of matching with the fixed - order prediction . at the simplest level",
    "one may think of matching as simply adding the fixed - order and resummed predictions while subtracting out the doubly counted ( logarithmic ) terms .",
    "such a procedure is however too naive in that the fixed - order contribution generally contains terms that are subleading with respect to the terms included in the resummation , but which still diverge .",
    "for example when matching nll and nlo calculations , one finds that the nlo result has a term @xmath129 , which in the distribution diverges as @xmath130 .",
    "this is unphysical and the matching procedure must be sufficiently sophisticated so as to avoid this problem , and in fact it should nearly always ensure that the matched distribution goes to zero for @xmath131 .",
    "several procedures exist , such as @xmath128 and @xmath109 matching  @xcite and multiplicative matching @xcite and they differ from one - another only in terms that are nnlo and nnll , i.e.  formally beyond the state - of - the - art accuracy .",
    "we note the matching generally ensures that the resummation , in addition to being correct at nll accuracy ( our shorthand for nll@xmath115 ) , is also correct at nnll@xmath123 accuracy .",
    "matching also involves certain other subtleties , for example the ` modification of the logarithm ' , whereby @xmath132 is replaced with @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the largest kinematically allowed value for the observable .",
    "this ensures that the logarithms go to zero at @xmath134 , rather than at some arbitrary point ( usually @xmath135 ) , which is necessary in order for the resulting matched distribution to vanish at @xmath134 .",
    "[ sec : means ] [ sec : meanpc ]    much of the interest in event shapes stems from the wealth of data that is available , covering a large range of centre of mass energies ( @xmath0 ) or photon virtualities ( dis ) .",
    "the @xmath0 data comes from the pre - lep experiments  @xcite , the four lep experiments @xcite @xcite @xcite and sld  @xcite .",
    "in addition , because many observables have been proposed only in the last ten or so years and owing to the particular interest ( see below ) in data at moderate centre of mass energies , the jade data have been re - analysed @xcite . have also been obtained from lep  1 @xcite by considering events with an isolated hard final - state photon and treating them as if they were pure qcd events whose centre of mass energy is that of the recoiling hadronic system .",
    "such a procedure is untrustworthy because it assumes that one can factorise the gluon production from the photon production .",
    "this is only the case when there is strong ordering in transverse momenta between the photon and gluon , and is not therefore applicable when both the photon and the gluon are hard .",
    "tests with monte carlo event generators which may indicate that any ` non - factorisation ' is small  @xcite are not reliable , because the event generator used almost certainly does not contain the full 1-photon , 1-gluon matrix element .",
    "it is also to be noted that the isolation cuts on the photon will bias the distribution of the event shapes , in some cases @xcite similarly to an event - shape energy - flow correlation  @xcite .",

    "it was pointed out in  @xcite that this is inconsistent and full ( two - loop ) calculations revealed  @xcite that if the ` naive ' @xmath152 coefficient is calculated in an appropriate scheme , then the factor @xmath169 comes out to be universal .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this is essentially a consequence of the fact that regardless of whether one accounts for the virtual gluon decay , the distribution of ` non - perturbative ' transverse momentum is independent of rapidity ( the ` tube - model ' of  @xcite , based essentially on boost invariance ) .",
    "while the factor @xmath169 corrects the @xmath152 at two - loop level , the question of even higher order corrections is still open , although one can argue that such effects will be suppressed by a factor @xmath172 relative to the leading power correction .",

[ fig : meandata ] ( right ) any correction to @xmath184 is certainly small compared to that for other observables .",
    "a general point to be kept in mind is that the universality of @xmath163 can be broken by contributions of order @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the mass scale for hadrons @xcite . whether this happens or not depends on the hadron mass scheme in which the observable",

    "the @xmath57-scheme is free of universality breaking terms , as is the decay scheme ( since hadron masses are zero ) .",

    "simple renormalon - inspired arguments suggest that the @xmath191 moments of event shapes should have as their leading power correction at most a @xmath192 contribution ( essentially since @xmath193 vanishes at @xmath194 for small @xmath195 ) .",
    "however as was pointed out by webber  @xcite , the fact ( to be discussed in section  [ sec : anldist ] ) that the @xmath146 power correction essentially corresponds to a shift of the distribution ( for @xmath6 , @xmath38 and @xmath196 , but not for the broadenings ) , means that to a first approximation we will have @xmath197 given that @xmath198 is of order @xmath94 , all higher moments of event shapes will receive power corrections of order @xmath199 , which is parametrically larger than @xmath192 . strictly speaking it is not possible to guarantee the coefficient of @xmath199 given in eq .",

    "an alternative coefficient for the @xmath199 power correction has been proposed in  @xcite , however since it also is not based on a full calculation of the power correction in the three - jet region ( which does not yet exist ) , it is subject to precisely the same reservations as eq .",

    "a final @xmath65-jet result of interest  @xcite is that for the @xmath38-parameter just above the sudakov shoulder , at @xmath125 . this is the only case where a proper calculation exists for the power correction to a two - jet observable in the three jet limit : @xmath204 this is slightly less than half the correction that appears in the two - jet limit ( @xmath205 ) .",

    "two other points of view that have also been used in analysing data on @xmath5 event shapes are the approach of _ dressed gluons _ employed by gardi and grunberg @xcite and the use of _ renormalisation group improved _ perturbation theory  @xcite as carried out by the delphi collaboration  @xcite .      in the gardi - grunberg approach one uses the basic concept of renormalons ( on which the dw model is also based ) , but",

    "this renormalon integral is ill - defined due to the landau singularity in the running coupling and instead of assuming an infrared finite coupling below some matching scale @xmath160 as was the case in the dw model , gardi and grunberg define the renormalon integral by its principal value ( a discussion of the theoretical merits of different approaches has been give in  @xcite ) . in doing this",
    "they explicitly include higher order renormalon contributions in their perturbative result , rather than including them via power behaved corrections below scale @xmath160 that result from assuming an infrared finite coupling ( though they do also compare to something similar , which they call a ` cutoff ' approach ) .",
    "however since one is dealing with an ambiguous integral ( a prescription other than a principal value one would give a result differing by an amount proportional to a power correction ) one must still allow for a power correction term .",
    "gardi and grunberg studied the mean thrust in @xmath5 annihilation and used the following form for fitting to the data : @xmath226+\\frac{\\lambda}{q}\\ ] ] where the subscript pv denotes the principal value of the renormalon integral @xmath227 for the thrust ( which includes the full lo contribution and parts of the higher - order contributions ) and @xmath228 is a piece that accounts for the difference between the true nlo coefficient for @xmath14 and the contribution included in @xmath227 .",

    "we note that @xmath233 in this approach corresponds to a smaller power correction than is required in the dw model .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the inclusion of pieces of higher perturbative orders via a principal value prescription , although it leads to a somewhat small value ( compared to the world average ) of the coupling at scale @xmath234 .",
    "next we turn to the renormalisation group improved ( rgi ) perturbative estimates  @xcite that have also been used to compare with event shape data for the mean value of different event shapes in @xmath5 annihilation . the basic idea behind this approach is to consider the dependence of the observable on the scale @xmath82 , which can be expressed using renormalisation group invariance as @xmath235 where in the above formula @xmath236 , @xmath237 , with @xmath238 being the mean value of a given event shape and @xmath239 being the coefficient of @xmath240 in its perturbative expansion .     from comparisons to @xmath5 event - shape data using the rgi approach .",

    "the delphi collaboration  @xcite have performed a combined fit of the parameter @xmath247 and a parameter @xmath255 that quantifies the power correction  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath255 was found to be consistent with zero in most cases and rather small in all cases which indicates that there is no real need for a power behaved correction once the perturbative expansion is fixed through the rgi technique .",
    "the agreement between @xmath1 values extracted from different observables is impressive ( see figure  [ fig : rgi ] ) with a spread that is only about half as large as that obtained using the standard perturbative result supplemented by a power correction term , using the dw initiated model .",
    "while it is clear that the size of the power correction piece inevitably depends on how one choses to define the perturbative expansion ( in fact all the methods discussed thus far , including the dw model and the gardi - grunberg approach , account for this effect ) , it is nevertheless very interesting that for several different observables , with significantly different perturbative coefficients , one observes after the introduction of rgi , hardly any need for a power correction term .",
    "certainly it is not clear on the basis of any physical arguments , why the genuine non - perturbative power correction should be vanishingly small and that a perturbative result defined in a certain way should lead to a complete description of the data .",
    "the clarification of this issue is still awaited and the above findings are worth further attention and study .    a final point to be kept in mind about the rgi approach in the above form ,",
    "is that it is valid only for inclusive observables that depend on just a single relevant scale parameter @xmath82 .",
    "this makes its applicability somewhat limited and for instance it is not currently clear how to extend the procedure so as to allow a meaningful study of event shape distributions in @xmath5 annihilation or dis event shape mean values and distributions ( which involve additional scales ) .",
    "so far our discussion of comparisons between theory and experiment has been limited to a study of mean values of the event shapes .",
    "as we have seen , there is some ambiguity in the interpretation of these comparisons , with a range of different approaches being able to fit the same data .",
    "this is in many respects an unavoidable limitation of studies of mean values , since the principal characteristic of the different models that is being tested is their @xmath82-dependence , which can also be influenced by a range of ( neglected ) higher - order contributions .",
    "in contrast , the full distributions of event shapes contain considerably more information and therefore have the potential to be more discriminatory .",
    "in section  [ sec : perturbative ] we discussed the perturbative calculation of distributions .",
    "as for mean values though , the comparison to data is complicated by the need for non - perturbative corrections .",
    "these corrections however involve many more degrees of freedom than for mean values , and there are a variety of ways of including them .",
    "accordingly we separate our discussion into two parts : in section  [ sec : evgen ] we shall consider studies in which hadronisation corrections are taken from monte carlo event generators , and where the main object of study is the perturbative distribution , with for example fits of the strong coupling . in section",
    "[ sec : anldist ] we shall then consider studies which involve analytical models for the non - perturbative corrections , and where it is as much the non - perturbative models , as the perturbative calculations that are under study .       compared to a variety of event generators  @xcite .",
    "the shaded band in the lower plot indicates the experimental statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "figure taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   compared to a variety of event generators  @xcite .",
    "the shaded band in the lower plot indicates the experimental statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "figure taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]      before considering the purely perturbative studies mentioned above , let us recall that one major use of event shape distributions has been in the testing and tuning @xcite of monte carlo event generators such as herwig  @xcite , jetset / pythia  @xcite and ariadne  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : tuning ] shows comparisons for two event shapes , the thrust and thrust major , and the agreement is remarkable testimony to the ability of the event generators to reproduce the data .",
    "the use of event generators to probe the details of qcd is unfortunately rather difficult , essentially because they contain a number of parameters affecting both the non - perturbative modelling and in some cases the treatment of the perturbative shower . furthermore though considerable progress is being made in matching to fixed order calculations",
    "( see for example  @xcite ) , event generators are in general able to guarantee neither the nll accuracy nor the nlo accuracy of full matched nll - nlo resummed calculations .",
    "event - shapes ( global @xcite two - jet event shapes ) herwig @xcite is expected to be correct to nll accuracy . ]",
    "nevertheless , the good agreement of the event generators with the data suggests that the bulk of the dynamics is correct and in particular that a good model for the hadronisation corrections can be had by comparing parton and hadron ` levels ' of the generator .",
    "there has been a very widespread use of event generators in this way to complement the nll+nlo perturbative calculations .",
    "such a method has both advantages and drawbacks and it is worth devoting some space to them here . on one hand ,",
    "the parton level of an event generator is not a theoretically well - defined concept  it is regularised with some effective parton mass or transverse momentum cutoff , which already embodies some amount of non - perturbative correction .",
    "in contrast the nlo+nll partonic prediction integrates down to zero momenta without any form ( or need ) of regularisation .",
    "this too implies some amount of non - perturbative contribution , but of a rather different nature from that included via a cutoff .",
    "the resulting difference between the event - generator and the purely perturbative nlo+nll parton levels means that the ` hadronisation ' that must be applied to correct them to hadron level is different in the two cases .",
    "there are nevertheless reasons why event - generators are still used for determining the hadronisation corrections .",
    "the simplest is perhaps that they give a very good description of the data ( cf .",
    "[ fig : tuning ] ) , which suggests that they make a reasonable job of approximating the underlying dynamics .",
    "furthermore the good description is obtained with a single set of parameters for all event shapes , whereas as we shall see , other approaches with a single ( common ) parameter are currently able to give equally good descriptions only for a limited number of event shapes at a time .",
    "additionally , the objection that the monte carlo parton level is ill - defined can , partially , be addressed by including a systematic error on the hadronisation : it is possible for example to change the internal cutoff on the monte carlo parton shower and at the same time retune the hadronisation parameters in such a way that the monte carlo description of the hadron - level data remains reasonable . in this way one",
    "allows for the fact that the connection between monte carlo and nll+nlo ` parton - levels ' is not understood .",
    "this is the procedure that has been used for example in @xcite , and the results are illustrated in figure  [ fig : sldhadr ] as a hadronisation correction factor @xmath256 with an uncertainty corresponding to the shaded band .",
    ", with uncertainties , as discussed in the text ) obtained from the ratio of jetset parton to hadron - level distributions .",
    "it is compared to nlo and nll+nlo predictions .",
    "also shown is the detector to hadron - level correction factor @xmath257 .",
    "figure taken from  @xcite . ]",
    "two further points are to be made regarding monte carlo hadronisation corrections .",
    "firstly , as is starting now to be well known , it is strongly recommended not to correct the data to parton - level , but rather to correct the theoretical perturbative prediction to hadron level .",
    "this is because the correction to parton level entails the addition of extra assumptions , which a few years later may be very difficult to deconvolve from the parton - level ` data ' .",
    "it is straightforward on the other hand to apply a new hadronisation model to a perturbative calculation .",
    "secondly it is best not to treat the hadronisation correction as a simple multiplicative factor . to understand why",
    ", one should look again at figure  [ fig : sldhadr ] ( which , dating from several years ago , corrects data to parton level ) .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath256 ( parton@xmath258hadron ) varies very rapidly close to the peak of the distribution and goes from above @xmath161 to below @xmath161 .",
    "this is because the distribution itself varies very rapidly in this region and the effect of hadronisation is ( to a first approximation , see below ) to shift the peak to larger values of the observable .",
    "but a multiplicative factor , rather than shifting the peak , suppresses it in one place and recreates it ( from non - peak - like structure ) in another . instead of applying a multiplicative correction , the best way to include",
    "a monte carlo hadronisation correction is to determine a transfer matrix @xmath259 which describes the fraction of events in bin @xmath56 at parton level that end up in in bin @xmath55 at hadron level .",
    "then for a binned perturbative distribution @xmath260 , the binned hadronised distribution @xmath261 is obtained by matrix multiplication , @xmath262 .",
    "this has been used for example in @xcite .",
    "having considered the basis and methods for including hadronisation corrections from event generators , let us now examine some of the perturbative studies made possible by this approach .",
    "the majority of them use nll+nlo perturbative calculations to fit for the strong coupling ( as discussed below some , e.g.  @xcite , just use nlo results , which exist for a wider range of observables ) and such fits can be said to be one of the principal results from event - shape studies . in general",
    "there is rather good agreement between the data and the resummed predictions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : sldhadr ] ) .     obtained by fitting nll+nlo event - shape distributions to l3 data at a range of centre of mass energies (",
    "figure taken from  @xcite ) .",
    "only experimental uncertainties are shown.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    an example of such a study is given in figure  [ fig : l3asevln ] , which shows results for fits of @xmath1 to l3 data at a range of energies ( including points below @xmath263 from radiative events which , as discussed earlier , are to be taken with some caution ) .",
    "one important result from such studies is an overall value for @xmath1 , which in this case is @xmath264 @xcite , where the first error is experimental and the second is theoretical .",
    "similar results have been given by other collaborations , e.g.  @xmath265 from aleph  @xcite .",
    "there is also good evidence for the evolution of the coupling , though leaving out the potentially doubtful radiative points leaves the situation somewhat less clearcut , due to the limited statistics at high energies ( another resummed study which gives good evidence for the running of the coupling uses jade and opal data  @xcite , however it is limited to jet rates ) .    these and similar results from the other lep collaborations and jade highlight two important points .",
    "firstly at higher energies there is a need to combine results from all the lep experiments in order to reduce the statistical errors and so improve the evidence for the running of the coupling in the region above @xmath127 .",
    "work in this direction is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "so far only preliminary results are available @xcite , and as well as improving the picture of the high - energy running of the coupling , they suggest a slightly smaller value of @xmath1 than that quoted above , more in accord with world averages  @xcite .    secondly , in the overall result for @xmath266 , by far the most important contribution to the error is that from theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however theoretical uncertainties are notoriously difficult to estimate , since they relate to unknown higher orders .",
    "systematic investigations of the various sources of uncertainty have been carried out in  @xcite and in particular @xcite proposes a standard for the set of sources of uncertainty that ought to be considered , together with an approach for combining the different sources into a single overall uncertainty on @xmath94 .",
    "one of the main principles behind the method is that while one may have numerous estimates of sources of theoretical uncertainty , it is not advisable to combine them in quadrature , as one might be tempted to do , because this is likely to lead to a double - counting of uncertainties .",
    "rather , one should examine the different sources of uncertainty across the whole range of the distribution and at each point , take the maximum of all sources to build up an uncertainty envelope or band , represented by the shaded area in figure  [ fig : lepqcdbands ] ( shown relative to a reference prediction for a ` standard ' theory ) .",
    "the overall uncertainty on the coupling ( rather than the distribution ) is given by the range of variation of @xmath94 such that the prediction remains within the band .",
    "it is to be noted that this kind of approach is of relevance not just to event - shape studies but also quite generally to any resummed matched calculation , which is inherently subject to many sources of arbitrariness .",
    "allowed such that the prediction stays within the uncertainty band.,scaledwidth=63.0% ]      one of the drawbacks of nll+nlo studies is that the nll resummed predictions exist for only a fraction of observables .",
    "recently there has been an extensive study by the delphi collaboration @xcite of 18 event - shape distributions compared to nlo calculations . since in most cases",
    "nlo calculations with a renormalisation scale @xmath267 tend to describe the data rather poorly , they have examined various options for estimating higher orders so as to improve the agreement .",
    "their main approach involves a simultaneous fit of the coupling and the renormalisation scale , i.e.   the renormalisation scale dependence is taken as a way of parameterising possible higher orders . in such a procedure",
    "the choice of fit - range for the observable is rather critical , since the true higher - orders may involve have quite a different structure from that parameterised by the @xmath168 dependence .",
    "the delphi analysis restricts the fit range to be that in which a good fit can be obtained . with these conditions they find relatively consistent values of @xmath94 across their whole range of observables ( finding a scatter of a few percent ) , with a relatively modest theoretical uncertainty , as estimated from the further variation of @xmath168 by a factor of @xmath13 to @xmath16 around the optimal scale .",
    "their overall result from all observables treated in this way is @xmath268 ( including both experimental and theoretical errors ) .",
    "they also compare this approach to a range of other ways of ` estimating ' higher orders .",
    "they find for example that some theoretically based methods for setting the scale ( principle of minimal sensitivity  @xcite , effective charge @xcite ) lead to scales that are quite correlated to the experimentally fitted ones , while another method ( blm @xcite ) is rather uncorrelated .",
    "they compare also to resummation approaches , though there is no equivalent renormalisation scale choice that can be made .",
    "instead the comparison involves rather the quality of fit to the distribution and the final spread of final @xmath1 values as a measure of neglected higher - order uncertainties .",
    "not surprisingly , they find that while the nll results work well in the two - jet region , in the three - jet region the combined nll+nlo predictions fare not that much better than the pure ( @xmath267 ) nlo results .",
    "they go on to argue that nll+nlo is somewhat disfavoured compared to nlo with an ` optimal ' scale .",
    "this statement is however to be treated with some caution , since the fit range was chosen specifically so as to obtain a good fit for nlo with the ` optimal ' scale  one could equally have chosen a fit range tuned to the nll+nlo prediction and one wonders whether the nlo with optimal scale choice would then have fared so well .",
    "regardless of this issue of fit range , it is interesting to note that over the set of observables which can be treated by both methods , the total spread in @xmath1 values is quite similar , being @xmath269 in the case of nlo with optimal scale choice and @xmath270 for nll+nlo .",
    "this is similar to the spread seen for fits to mean values with analytical hadronisation models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meanfits ] ) , though the rgi fits of  @xcite have a somewhat smaller error .",
    "the jet rates ( especially the durham and cambridge algorithms and certain members of the jade family ) are among the few observables for which the pure nlo calculation gives a reasonable description of the distribution ( cf .  table  3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "one particularly interesting set of nlo studies makes use of the 3-jet rate as a function of @xmath271 ( this is just the integral of the distribution of @xmath137 ) in events with primary @xmath144-quarks as compared to light - quark events @xcite ( some of the analyses use other observables , such as the 4-jet rate or the thrust ) . using nlo calculations which account for massive quarks @xcite",
    "makes it possible , in such studies , to extract a value for the @xmath144 mass at a renormalisation scale of @xmath263 , giving first evidence of the ( expected ) running of the @xmath144-quark mass , since all the analyses find @xmath272 in the range @xmath273 to @xmath274  gev ( with rather variable estimates of the theoretical error ) .",
    "we have already seen , in section  [ sec : meanpc ] , that analytical models for hadronisation corrections , combined with normal perturbative predictions , can give a rather good description of mean values . there",
    "the inclusion of a non - perturbative ( hadronisation ) correction was a rather simple affair , eq .",
    "( [ eq : meancorrections ] ) , since it was an additive procedure .",
    "in contrast the general relation between the full distribution @xmath275 for an observable @xmath276 and the perturbatively calculated distribution @xmath277 is more complicated , @xmath278 where @xmath279 encodes all the non - perturbative information .",
    "( [ eq : shapegenconvoluion ] ) can be seen as a generalised convolution , where the shape of the convolution function depends on the value @xmath86 of the variable as well as the coupling and hard scale .",
    "such a general form contains far more information however than can currently be predicted , or even conveniently parameterised . accordingly",
    "analytical hadronisation approaches generally make a number of simplifying assumptions , intended to be valid for some restricted range of the observable .      the most radical simplification of eq .",

    "the situation is more complicated because the power correction is enhanced by the rapidity over which the quark and thrust axes can be considered to coincide , @xmath287 , @xmath288 being the angle between thrust and quark axes  this angle is strongly correlated with the value of the broadening ( determined by perturbative radiation ) and accordingly the extent of the shift becomes @xmath252-dependent  @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is the @xmath0 wide - jet broadening , for which one has @xmath289 where the shift is written for the integrated distribution @xmath290 in order to simplify the expressions .",
    "the @xmath291 enhancement for the power correction to the mean broadening ( tables  [ tab : cvs ] and [ tab : cvsdis ] ) comes about simply because the average value of @xmath292 , after integration over @xmath86 with the resummed distribution , is of order @xmath293 .",

    "accordingly , success in fitting a given event - shape distribution for any single value of @xmath82 can not , alone , be considered strong evidence in favour of the shape - function picture .",
    "the true test of the approach comes by determining the shape function at one value of @xmath82 and then establishing whether it applies for all values of @xmath82 .",
    "this is illustrated for the @xmath0 thrust in fig .",
    "[ fig : thrustshape ] ( left ) , where the following shape - function has been used @xcite , @xmath330 with two free parameters , @xmath331 and @xmath254 ( it has been argued that the behaviour of this function for small @xmath176 and large @xmath176 is similar to that expected from a simple physical model for the dynamics at the origin of the shape function  @xcite ) .",
    "one notes the remarkable agreement , far into the two - jet region , for the whole range of @xmath82 values .    ) . shown for @xmath332 and @xmath333  gev .",

    "right : the thrust distribution at the perturbative ( dge ) level , with a non - perturbative shift , and with a shape function .",
    "figure taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    this is a clear success for the shape - function approach as compared to the simple shift discussed above .",
    "however the drawback of shape - functions is that a priori one loses all predictivity ( save for the first moment ) when going from one observable to another .",
    "this predictivity was one of the main strengths of the shift approach .",
    "considerable work has therefore been devoted to understanding both the general properties of shape functions and the relations between shape functions of different observables .",
    "one line of investigation has been to relate the shape functions for the thrust and heavy - jet mass ( @xmath196 )  this can be done with the help of the observation  @xcite that in the two - jet limit the thrust is just the sum of the light and heavy - jet ( squared normalised ) masses . in  @xcite",
    "korchemsky and tafat introduced a shape function @xmath334 describing the distribution of non - perturbative radiation in each of the two hemispheres .",
    "the shape function for the thrust is then obtained by @xmath335 instead for the heavy - jet mass one calculates the full ( np ) double differential distribution for the two jet masses and from that derives the heavy - jet mass distribution ( this is not quite equivalent to a simple shape - function for @xmath196 ) .",
    "this approach gave a good fit to the thrust and heavy - jet mass data , on the condition that there was significant correlation between the non - perturbative contribution to the two hemispheres .-",
    "parameter ( with an overall rescaling to ensure the correct first moment ) , however the data were less well described than for the thrust .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising : owing to different sensitivities to large - angle radiation , the thrust and @xmath38-parameter shape functions are expected to have a different structure of higher moments  @xcite . ]",
    "it is difficult to interpret this result however , because as has already been mentioned , the default measurement scheme for the jet masses suffers from extra ( universality - breaking ) @xmath146 corrections , and it is possible that in  @xcite these are being mimicked by inter - hemisphere correlations .",
    "the thrust and heavy - jet mass have been investigated in great detail also by gardi and rathsman  @xcite . in analogy with the approach for the mean thrust  @xcite",
    ", they attempt not only to account for nll+nlo and power correction contributions , but also for all ( perturbative ) enhanced effects associated with the running of the coupling , within a formalism that they refer to as dressed gluon exponentiation ( dge ) . among the interesting theoretical results ( see also  @xcite ) is that the renormalon analysis suggests that the second moment of the shape function should be precisely that expected from a pure shift ( the same is true for the @xmath38-parameter @xcite ) .",
    "this observation seems to be consistent with fits to the data , and would explain why the shift approximation works so well , at least for the relevant observables .",
    "the right - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : thrustshape ] shows the result of their analysis for the thrust , with both a shift and a shape - function .",
    "while the shape - function is clearly needed in the immediate vicinity of the peak and below , it is striking to see , above the peak , how well it is approximated by the shift .",
    "one of the other interesting results in  @xcite relates to the analysis of the heavy - jet mass .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , a common hadron - mass scheme ( decay - scheme ) is used for the thrust and the heavy - jet mass , and there are no inter - hemisphere correlations in their shape function .",
    "using the same parameters for the thrust and @xmath196 leads to reasonable fits , suggesting that the true inter - hemisphere correlations may actually be small .",
    "( a fit for @xmath196 alone does however prefer a lower value of @xmath94 than for the thrust , as is seen also with the usual shifted nll+nlo approach @xcite ) .",
    "a puzzle that emerges in the work of  @xcite is that all the fits lead to quite small values of the coupling , @xmath336 with a theoretical error of about @xmath210 .",
    "a similarly low result was obtained in the analogous analysis of the mean thrust  @xcite . in contrast a study of @xmath144-fragmentation using dressed gluon exponentiation finds more standard values , @xmath337  @xcite .",
    "let us close our discussion of shape functions with a recent result by berger & sterman  @xcite .",
    "given that there are no simple relations between the shape functions for most common event shapes , they instead consider a new class of event shapes  @xcite whose definition involves a parameter @xmath331 which allows the nature of the event shape to be continuously varied from a broadening ( @xmath338 ) to a thrust - type observable ( @xmath339 ) and beyond .",
    "their observation is that for all variants of the observable with @xmath340 , the logarithm of any moment of the shape functions scales as @xmath341 . in practice",
    "this scaling is found to hold in monte carlo studies of this class of observables  it would therefore be interesting to have data for these observables with which to make a comparison .",
    "conceptually , event shapes are rather simple observables , yet they are sensitive to a range of characteristics of qcd radiation .",
    "this combination of theoretical simplicity and experimental sensitivity is perhaps one of the main reasons why event shapes have found so many applications .",
    "as we have seen , they provide vital inputs in studies of the ingredients of the qcd lagrangian , such as the coupling and the colour factors ; they play an important role in the tuning and testing of event generators ; and they are at the heart of recent investigations into analytical approaches to understanding the dynamics of hadronisation",
    ".    there remain several directions in which progress may be expected ( or at the very least hoped for ) in coming years .",
    "all the experimental comparisons discussed here have been for event - shapes that vanish in the @xmath16-jet limit , yet there have been significant theoretical developments in recent years for observables that vanish also in the @xmath65-jet limit , examples being the @xmath39-parameter and thrust minor @xcite .",
    "studies with jet rates @xcite suggest that going to such ` three - jet ' observables could reduce theoretical errors , though as discussed in @xcite this needs to be investigated more systematically .",
    "additionally three - jet observables will allow much more stringent tests of analytical hadronisation approaches since for the first time they introduce sensitivity to predictions about hadronisation from a gluon  @xcite , not just from a quark .",
    "one of the frontiers of event shape studies is their extension to new processes .",
    "while @xmath0 is the traditional domain for event - shape studies , we have seen that studies in dis are in many respects competitive with @xmath0 results .",
    "additionally they provide important input on the question of universality of analytical hadronisation models , ruling out for example significant modifications of the hadronisation picture stemming from interactions with the proton remnant .",
    "though so far the question has received only limited study , one interesting application of dis studies would be in the use of event shapes for obtaining information on parton distribution functions , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "currently an option that is attracting growing experimental  @xcite and theoretical @xcite interest is the development of event shapes in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "though much work remains to be done on this subject , it seems that the sensitivity to parton distributions will be somewhat stronger than in most dis observables .",
    "furthermore one expects a rich hadronisation structure associated both with the four - jet structure of hadronic dijet events and with the properties of the underlying event .",
    "it is to be hoped that the availability of automated resummation methods  @xcite will make the theoretical aspects of the study of new observables and processes more straightforward than has been the case in the past .",
    "another frontier on which progress is expected in near future is with respect to the accuracy of theoretical predictions .",
    "nnlo perturbative calculations are making rapid progress ( for a recent review see @xcite ) with the main outstanding problem being that of a full subtraction procedure for combining zero , one and two - loop contributions and its implementation in a monte carlo integrator .",
    "progress on nnll resummations is also being made , albeit so far only in inclusive cases  @xcite .",
    "though technically more involved , an extension to event shape resummations is certainly conceivable in the near future . aside from the expected gains in accuracy that are the main motivation for these calculations",
    ", it will also be interesting to compare the exact higher - order calculations with predictions from approaches such as  @xcite which aim to identify the physically dominant higher - order contributions and in some cases  @xcite claim to significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainties on @xmath94 .",
    "less predictable is what development can be expected on the subject of hadronisation corrections .",
    "as we have seen , much has been learnt from event - shape studies . yet",
    "a variety of open questions remain . at a practical level it would for example be of interest to see an extension of the shape - function approach to a wider range of variables , including the quite subtle case of the broadenings and also to dis event shapes .",
    "the wealth of dis data at low @xmath82 , where shape functions are most important , makes the latter especially interesting .",
    "there remain also important issues that are poorly understood even at the conceptual level . for example",
    "predictions are currently limited to the domain in which the event - shape is close to vanishing ( e.g.  @xmath14 in the @xmath16-jet limit ) .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that problems that persist for a couple of ` recalcitrant ' observables ( specifically , @xmath196 , @xmath301 ) may actually be due to large differences between the power correction in the three - jet region ( a significant part of the fit - range ) and that in the well - understood two - jet limit ( see e.g.   fig .  3 of  @xcite ) . but techniques that would allow the calculation of the power correction to , say , the thrust or the broadening in the @xmath65-jet limit do not yet exist .",
    "another ( partially related ) issue is that of anomalous dimensions  these have so far only been calculated for @xmath146 effects that are associated with hadron masses  @xcite .",
    "yet , as has been pointed out also in @xcite , they are bound to be present for all classes of power suppressed contributions .",
    "one clear physical origin for them is that soft - gluons ( or hadrons ) with transverse momenta of order @xmath254 are radiated not just from the @xmath206 system but also from all soft perturbative gluons with transverse momenta between @xmath254 and @xmath82 .",
    "accounting for radiation from the latter will clearly lead to enhancements of power corrections by terms @xmath342 . and",
    "a final point , not to be forgotten , is that most of the analytical hadronisation approaches are essentially perturbative methods ` in disguise ' .",
    "an understanding of how they really relate to _ _",
    "hadron__isation is very much lacking .",
    "let us close this review by remarking that one of the characteristics of event shape studies is that progress is made not merely through a better understanding of existing observables and data , but also through critical experimental studies of new observables with ( supposedly ! ) better theoretical properties .",
    "the dialogue between experimenters and theorists is crucial in this respect .",
    "we look forward to its being as fruitful in coming years as it has been up to now .",
    "it goes without saying that we are grateful to our collaborators and numerous other colleagues , including members of the lep qcd working group , for the many stimulating discussions that we have had about event shapes . for discussions on issues that arose specifically while writing this review , we thank in particular g.  heinrich , f.  krauss ,",
