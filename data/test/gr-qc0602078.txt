    "<S> boson star systems have rapidly decaying nonradial quasinormal modes and thus the complete gravitational waveform could be extracted for all configurations studied . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational waves emitted from stable , critical , and unstable boson star configurations are analyzed and the numerically observed quasinormal mode frequencies are compared with known linear perturbation results . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition of the high frequency nonspherical modes on the lower frequency spherical modes was observed in the metric oscillations when perturbations with radial and nonradial components were applied . </S>",
    "<S> the collapse of unstable boson stars to black holes was simulated . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent horizons were observed to be slightly nonspherical when initially detected and became spherical as the system evolved . </S>",
    "<S> the application of nonradial perturbations proportional to spherical harmonics is observed not to affect the collapse time . </S>",
    "<S> an unstable star subjected to a large perturbation was observed to migrate to a stable configuration . </S>"
