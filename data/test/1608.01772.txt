    "the left and right panels denote results without escape of nsm ejecta ( @xmath158 ) and with escape , respectively .    the constant sfe significantly delays the enrichment of r - process elements compared to iron and the predicted abundances of emp stars do not match observational results , as mentioned in previous chemical evolution studies .",
    "the predicted abundances of r - process elements are significantly lower than observations at @xmath0}\\lesssim -2 $ ] , and r - ii stars with @xmath159 around @xmath0}\\sim -3 $ ] is not reproduced . on the other hand , if the sfe is lower at lower mass proto - galaxies , r - process elements emerge at @xmath0}\\sim -3 $ ] , even with the long average delay time ( @xmath160 yr ) .",
    "this is because that enrichment timescale of iron is longer for low - mass proto - galaxies in which emp stars were formed and some nsms can take place within the formation epoch of emp stars .",
    "these are consistent with the result of the one zone model by @xcite .",
    "when we do not consider the escape of nsm ejecta from the host proto - galaxies , however , the majority of stars with @xmath0 } < -3 $ ] show very low r - process abundances with [ ba / fe ] @xmath161 , which is apparently at odds with observations ( see the top left panel of fig .",
    "3 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our escape model predicts @xmath162 or @xmath163 for the majority of stars at @xmath0}\\lesssim -3 $ ] , and well reproduces observations of halo stars , as shown in the right top panel .",
    "proto - galaxies lacking nsm events are polluted by r - process elements ejected from nsms in other proto - galaxies .",
    "as mentioned , igm pre - enrichment is mostly responsible for the r - process elements in these stars , and capture of high - energy r - process elements also contribute at @xmath164 .",
    "stars in proto - galaxies without a nsm are distributed at @xmath165 .",
    "nsm events of short delay time , @xmath166 , are the dominant sources of r - process elements for these stars . on the other hand , proto - galaxies in which nsm events take place form stars with @xmath167 .",
    "surface pollution can play an important role for stars in proto - galaxies without a nsm . without surface pollution , there emerges a depression in the number density of stars at @xmath0}\\sim -3 $ ] in the range of @xmath168 where the first nsm occurs .",
    "the surface pollution alleviates the gap . in the model with @xmath158 ,",
    "the surfaces of most emp stars have a tiny amount of ba such as @xmath169 even after surface pollution .    at @xmath0 } > -2 $ ] , the r - process abundance is averaged .",
    "the predicted ba abundance is lower than observations since we neglect the s - process contribution .    at @xmath0}\\gtrsim -1 $ ] , while we can see a clear decreasing trend of @xmath170 as metallicity increases , we do not see a similar  knee \" in the predicted r - process abundance distributions .",
    "this is because the increase of the nsm rate due to the long delay time compensates the increasing production rate of iron enhanced by sne ia .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed depression of @xmath13 is a lower frequency of nsms with high metallicity progenitor stars , although we assume constant frequency in the computation for simplicity .",
    "the event rate of nsms in this model is @xmath171 in the current mw , as shown in figure  [ nsmrate ] .",
    "it is also slightly higher than the estimation based on the observations of binary pulsars in the mw ( @xmath172 , * ? ? ?",
    "both the binary pulsars and the abundances of the metal rich stars indicate a factor of @xmath173 smaller nsm fraction than used in this paper at @xmath174 . at the right axis of figure  [ nsmrate ] ,",
    "the event rate in the mw is converted into the expected detection rate of the gravitational waves ( gws ) by the advanced ligo - virgo network .",
    "ongoing observations of gws will provide better constraints on the nsm rate .    for the metallicity dependence of the nsm rate ,",
    "studies of binary population synthesis predict a lower ns - ns merger rate for lower metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "for the bh - ns merger rate , on the other hand , @xcite predict that a rate for stars with the metallicity of @xmath175 is higher than the population i ( pop i ) stars while @xcite predict that a rate for pop iii stars is lower than that for pop i stars .",
    "further studies are required for the event rate , delay time distribution , and r - process yield of nsms , and their metallicity dependences .    in this paper , we assume that high - energy r - process elements go straight until they lose energies by interaction with gas particles . if proto - galaxies have magnetic field , however , particles can travel along a winding path , which decreases the escape probability and increases the capture rate . on the other hand , the escape probability can be higher in a disk - like gas density profile than in a gas sphere assumed in this work .",
    "in addition , nsm events at the outer region of a proto - galaxy will effectively transfer r - process elements into intergalactic space , although we only consider nsm events at the center of proto - galaxies . furthermore , a ns binary itself can go away from a proto - galaxy if it can get enough velocity from sn explosions .",
    "the velocity of a ns binary is depending on its binary orbit and sn kick .",
    "although we still have no reliable estimation for the velocity distribution of ns binaries , two observed binary pulsars show a proper motion of more than @xmath176 km / s @xcite , which exceeds the typical escape velocity of a proto - galaxy hosting emp stars .",
    "the igm pre - enrichment and transfer of r - process elements between proto - galaxies are depending on these details , but a model taking them into account is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "coalescence of ns binaries is one of the most plausible sites for r - process nucleosynthesis but results of previous chemical evolution models with nsms as major r - process sources is inconsistent with the observed r - process abundances of metal - poor stars .",
    "we revisit the galactic chemical evolution of r - process elements following the nsm scenario .",
    "the novelty of this paper is in considering the effect of propagation of nsm ejecta across proto - galaxies .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , r - process elements from nsms have very large stopping lengths due to their high velocities .",
    "we compute the escape of r - process elements from proto - galaxies , pre - enrichment of igm , and capture of the escaped elements by other proto - galaxies in the chemical evolution model based on the framework of the hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "we have confirmed that the nsm scenario can reproduce the emergence of r - process elements at @xmath0}\\sim -3 $ ] in the case of lower sfe for less massive proto - galaxies , while the constant sfe delays the enrichment of r - process elements , which results in abundance correlations incompatible with observations .    while previous chemical evolution models with the nsm scenario predict many stars lacking r - process elements at very low metallicities , our model with the long - distance propagation of nsm ejecta predicts @xmath165 for stars formed in proto - galaxies without a nsm .",
    "our model succeeds in reproducing the r - process abundance distribution of emp stars .",
    "this result indicates that the nsm scenario is not rejected by the galactic chemical evolution , when we consider the propagation of nsm ejecta beyond the proto - galaxies .",
    "our current model predicts a slightly higher event rate of nsms and results in @xmath177 higher than observations in the current mw while the good consistency with observations at very low metallicity .",
    "it may indicate the metallicity dependence of the nsm rate .",
    "future observations of gws and their electromagnetic counterparts will give us information about the nsm rate and its contribution to the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we adopt a periodic boundary condition which assumes that the high energy r - process elements incoming from outside the simulation box balance the elements escaping from the box .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable assumption at very high redshift since large scale density fluctuation tends to grow at low redshift .",
    "for example , at @xmath97 , only @xmath178 fluctuation of @xmath179 collapses , and the box size is much larger . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not a good approximation at low redshift since the environment around the current mw is significantly different from the average of the universe .    in the current universe , there are @xmath180 mw equivalent galaxies ( mwegs ) on average @xcite , but the number density in our computation box corresponds to @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "it may indicate that the production rate of high energy r - process elements ( the first term of eq .",
    "[ eq : he ] ) may be overestimated by factor @xmath183 at @xmath174 . the capture rate by proto - galaxies ( the second term of eq .",
    "[ eq : he ] ) may also be overestimated since the capture rate in this computation box is dominated by the mw at low redshift . in order to mimic this difference , we compute the chemical evolution model with replacing the eq .",
    "( [ eq : he ] ) to the following equation , @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the relative number density of mwegs .",
    "but for the different boundary condition . incoming rate of high energy r - process particles from boundaries are smaller than outgoing rate by proportional to the relative density of milky way equivalent galaxies .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "figure  [ boundary ] show the result .",
    "the predicted abundance distribution is indistinguishable from the fiducial model at high metallicity or high r - process abundance ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "this is because r - process elements of proto - galaxies in which these stars are formed are dominated by their own nsms . on the other hand , the abundance of proto - galaxies without nsm events decreases since the r - process element abundances of the igm decrease .",
    "the abundance of emp stars at @xmath186 formed before the first nsm in their host proto - galaxies decreases by @xmath187 dex .",
    "we note that the difference can be overestimated at low metallicity since the region around the mw should be more similar to the average of the universe at high redshift .",
