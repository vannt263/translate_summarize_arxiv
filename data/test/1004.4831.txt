    "shearing a fluid of orientable , e.g. rod - like particles is a fundamental example of a soft - matter system driven far away from equilibrium .",
    "the complex dynamics of such systems , examples being worm - like or cylindrical micelles @xcite , ( polymeric ) liquid crystals , blood cells , or colloidal rod ( e.g. tobacco virus ) suspensions , has become a focus of many experimental investigations @xcite , computer simulations @xcite , and theoretical studies over the last years ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . within the isotropic high - temperature ( or low - concentration )",
    "state , application of external shear typically yields either continuous flow - alignment or a discontinuous paranematic - nematic transition @xcite , depending on how close the underlying equilibrium transition is @xcite . corresponding rheological properties such as the  constitutive curve \" formed by the shear stress @xmath0 as function of the shear rate @xmath1 are already non - linear , implying a non - newtonian behavior of the viscosity .",
    "more spectacularly , shearing inside the nematic ( i.e. , orientationally ordered , yet translationally disordered ) phase can induce various bifurcations , that is , non - equilibrium transitions between different dynamic  states  characterized by a specific periodic or non - periodic motion of the nematic director @xcite .",
    "examples are the tumbling or wagging behavior observed both by theory @xcite and in experiments of sheared tobacco viruses @xcite .",
    "further issues receiving much attention are the appearance of rheochaos ( chaotic stress - strain curves and/or orientational dynamics ) @xcite , and , sometimes combined with that , spontaneous spatial - symmetry breaking associated to shear - banding @xcite . in the latter situation ,",
    "the system separates into domains characterized by different local shear rates .",
    "many of these fascinating phenomena can be described by mesoscopic theories focussing on the motion of some suitable , coarse - grained dynamic variables .",
    "an example is the approach developed by hess @xcite and doi @xcite , which is based on an equation of motion for the tensorial orientational order parameter , that is , the alignment tensor @xmath2 .",
    "a constitutive relation then yields the link from @xmath2 to the stress tensor @xmath3 and , thus , the rheology of the system .",
    "the theory is highly non - linear due to the use of a fourth - order landau - de gennes free energy functional describing the relaxation of @xmath4 towards equilibrium . as a consequence of this non - linearity , the ( five - dimensional ) dynamical system involving the independent components of @xmath4 generates complex orientational dynamics and associated rheological properties , even if the analysis is restricted to simple ( couette ) shear geometries and to spatially _ homogeneous _ systems ( for extensions of the hess - doi approach towards inhomogeneous systems see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another class of mesoscopic theories focusses directly on the shear stress @xmath0 as a dynamic variable @xcite , an example being the non - local johnson - segalman model @xcite .",
    "these models are capable of describing , on a quite general level , complex rheological behavior such as shear - banding @xcite , a drawback being that they reflect the ( orientational and/or translational ) dynamics within the underlying liquid only indirectly .    in the present study",
    "we are interested in both , rheological properties and orientational motion , of a complex fluid composed of rod - like particles .",
    "so far , most theoretical studies investigating the orientational dynamics take the shear rate @xmath1 as an external driving parameter . experiments , on the other hand , are often conducted at controlled shear stress ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; moreover , there are various devices where either stress or strain can be controlled .",
    "thus , it is an interesting question to which extent these macroscopic conditions influence the observed dynamics .    in the present study",
    "we explore the implications of controlled stress ( as compared to controlled shear rate ) via an extension of the mesoscopic equations for @xmath2 @xcite . in order to fix the (",
    "time - averaged ) shear stress at an externally imposed value , we supplement the five equations of motion for the nematic order parameters by a further differential equation for @xmath1 . the approach of @xmath0 towards its target value is governed by a control time , @xmath5 .",
    "this control scheme is inspired by the method used in experimental devices : the shear rate is adjusted such that the desired value of the shear stress is approached . some preliminary results for stress - controlled systems have been published in ref .  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we undertake a more systematic study focussing on spatially homogeneous states with only one ( constant ) non - vanishing component of the shear rate ( and stress- ) tensor .",
    "this restriction excludes , e.  g. , the appearance of shear bands @xcite , shear - induced layering @xcite , and other effects @xcite such as the emergence of secondary flow .",
    "however , we consider an analysis of the homogeneous system as compulsory before the full hydrodynamics with spatially inhomogeneous shear rates is performed . nonetheless , the present control approach could , in principle , be applied to inhomogeneous systems ( and cross - couplings between deformation rate and stresses ) without further ado .",
    "indeed , the mesoscopic theory on which our study is based , is fully capable of treating inhomogeneous effects , and we have already performed investigations in this direction ( yet without stress control ) in refs .  @xcite .",
    "a similar strategy was taken by other researchers ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical results for both , orientational dynamics and rheological properties ( i.e. , stress - strain curves and resulting viscosities ) are presented for stress - controlled systems at a fixed value of the  tumbling ",
    "parameter @xcite ( that is , the coupling strength between flow and orientational motion ) , which seems particularly promising based on earlier studies under fixed - strain conditions @xcite . the most interesting results are found at temperatures below the isotropic - to - nematic ( i - n ) phase transition , where the control method turns out to be crucial for the dynamics of the system .",
    "this concerns both the type of bifurcations and their characteristics .",
    "moreover , we show how our control scheme can be used to change _ chaotic _ states seen in systems without stress control into states with regular dynamics , or into stationary states .",
    "this puts our study in the more general context of control in non - linear dynamic systems , where the stabilization of steady or periodic fix points by feedback control of suitable dynamic variables is a major issue @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent sections  [ general]-[explicit_equations ] we summarize the main ingredients of the mesoscopic theory for rod - like particles under shear flow .",
    "our control method is introduced in sec .",
    "[ shear_control ] .",
    "section  [ results ] describes our numerical results , with an emphasis on sheared nematic systems . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] we summarize our main findings and suggest some future directions of research .",
    "we employ a mesoscopic description of the system , where the relevant dynamic variable is the orientational order parameter averaged over some volume in space . in a sheared liquid crystal",
    ", this order parameter corresponds to the time - dependent , 2nd - rank alignment tensor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 describes the molecular axis and @xmath8 indicates the symmetric traceless part of a tensor . in the isotropic equilibrium state ,",
    "all components of @xmath4 are zero . for _ uniaxial _ nematic orientational order , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a scalar proportional to the maier - saupe order parameter @xmath11 , and @xmath12 being the corresponding director . in a sheared system , however , the assumption of uniaxial order ( which leads to the so - called ericksen - leslie theory of orientational dynamics @xcite ) remains appropriate only for small shear rates and temperatures deep within the nematic phase . for intermediate and large shear rates and , in particular , in the vicinity of the i - n phase transition ,",
    "biaxial ordering occurs , and a complete description of the non - equilibrium dynamics requires the full tensor , @xmath2 .    taking @xmath4 as the relevant variable , the system s equilibrium behavior ( in the absence of shear ) is governed by the landau - de gennes free energy @xcite @xmath13 where the notation `` : '' stands for the trace over the product of the two symmetric tensors , and `` @xmath14 '' indicates conventional matrix multiplication . in eq .",
    "( [ free_energy ] ) , @xmath15 is the temperature which is the driving parameter for an i - n transition in a thermotropic liquid crystal ( for lyotropic systems , one would replace @xmath15 by the concentration of the particles ) .",
    "switching on an external shear flow characterized by a velocity field @xmath16 , the alignment tensor becomes a time - dependent quantity .",
    "here we employ the approach first derived from concepts of irreversible thermodynamics @xcite and later from a generalized fokker - planck equation for the orientational distribution function @xcite ( for similar though not identical approaches , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for homogeneous systems",
    "the equation of motion reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vorticity and @xmath19 is the strain rate tensor .",
    "specializing to the case of a plane couette flow characterized by a flow in @xmath20-direction , @xmath21 , the strain rate tensor simplifies to @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in these formulae ,",
    "@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) denote unit vectors along the coordinate axes .",
    "further , the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are relaxation time coefficients , and @xmath28 is a dimensionless coefficient . finally , the ( tensorial ) quantity @xmath29 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hess ] ) corresponds to the derivative of the free energy  ( [ free_energy ] ) with respect to the ( non - conserved ) order parameter , i.e. , @xmath30 . in the absence of shear ( i.e.",
    ", for @xmath31 ) this terms governs the relaxation of @xmath2 towards its equilibrium value determined by @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the ericksen - leslie theory of orientational dynamics @xcite follows from the present approach , when the alignment tensor is uniaxial and the effect of the shear flow on the magnitude of the order parameter can be disregarded .",
    "furthermore , as noted already in the introduction , the present approach can be generalized and has been already applied to inhomogeneous alignment states @xcite , central steps being the inclusion of gradient elasticity terms in the free energy ( see also @xcite ) and an appropriate description of feedback effects of the orientational motion on the flow profile @xcite . not surprisingly , however , these generalizations of the theory imply a substantial increase of the numerical effort , which is the reason why we stick to homogeneous states in the present work .",
    "we next consider the rheological properties of the sheared liquid crystal , which are characterized by its pressure tensor , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the latter consists of an isotropic part involving the hydrostatic pressure @xmath34 , an antisymmetric part , and an symmetric traceless part @xmath35 which we refer to as friction pressure tensor @xcite .",
    "the negative of this latter contribution is the so - called shear stress tensor , @xmath36 .",
    "this quantity is of special interest since it is directly linked with the orientational dynamics in the non - equilibrium system .",
    "specifically , one has @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the so - called second newtonian viscosity , and @xcite @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ p_al ] ) , @xmath40 is the density of the rod - like particles , @xmath41 is their mass , and @xmath42 is boltzmann s constant . in the absence of shear",
    ", one has @xmath43 and consequently @xmath44 .",
    "the friction pressure tensor then reduces to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hesseqpressure ] ) , which is present also in ( sheared ) systems of spherical particles . a concept to _ control _",
    "the shear stress externally is formulated in sec .",
    "[ shear_control ] .      in the practical analysis it is convenient to use scaled variables .",
    "details can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite",
    ". the equilibrium behavior of the system is determined by the effective temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "it follows that the ( first - order ) i - n transition occurs at @xmath46 ( which corresponds to the i - n coexistence point ) , and that the nematic phase ( isotropic ) is ( meta-)stable for temperatures @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . for the description of the non - equilibrium system , times and shear rates are made dimensionless with a convenient reference time .",
    "the latter is chosen as the relaxation time of the alignment at the isotropic - nematic coexistence , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "further , the strength of the coupling between the flow and the alignment tensor is characterized by the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "microscopically , @xmath51 is related to the _ shape _ of the particles , which can be characterized by the axis ratio @xmath52 ( for ellipsoidal particles ) .",

    "it follows that @xmath55 for spherical particles ( @xmath56 ) , whereas @xmath57 for elongated particles ( @xmath58 ) , which is the case considered here .",
    "finally , the scaled analogue of the shear rate @xmath1 is denoted as @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 defined above ) .",
    "besides scaling , the other important step towards practical solution of the problem is to rewrite the tensorial equation  ( [ eq : hess ] ) for the dynamics of @xmath4 into a set of scalar equations for its five independent components , @xmath61 .",
    "this is achieved via an expansion of @xmath4 in a standard tensorial basis @xcite .",

    "a closer analysis of the time - dependence of the individual components reveals that the _ transient _ behavior observed in the period between @xmath138 and @xmath139 time steps ( i.e. , well before the asymptotic kt state is reached ) somewhat depends on the control time , @xmath5 .",

    "this is in accordance to earlier findings on the robustness of the orientational dynamics with respect to time - dependent perturbations of the shear rate @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of our results within the nematic phase is that under controlled stress conditions , the transition from the kt into the shear - aligned state occurs before the system enters the chaotic ( c ) regime observed in calculations at fixed @xmath87 ( see fig .",

    "this suggests that stress control might have a _ stabilizing _ influence on shear - rate - induced chaotic states . to explore this conjecture",

    "the resulting time steps are @xmath136 for both values of @xmath143.,width=302 ]    the corresponding behavior of the in - plane components of the director , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , is shown in fig .  [ a1a2_switch ] .",
    "same as fig .",
    "[ stress_switch ] , but for the components @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the alignment tensor.,width=302 ]    in both figures , one clearly recognizes a drastic change of the dynamics upon the switch from shear- to stress control . before the switch one observes highly irregular dynamics of all non - fixed quantities , that is @xmath122 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 ( and the same holds for the other components of the tensor @xmath4 ) .",
    "closer results reveals that the system at fixed @xmath146 is indeed in a chaotic state @xcite . after the switch , that is , under controlled stress ,",
    "the dynamics becomes regular .",
    "interestingly , the _ character _ of this final state depends on both , the starting point ( @xmath143 ) of the stress control , and the corresponding delay time @xmath5 . for the choices @xmath148 and @xmath106 [ see figs .",

    "the average shear rate is @xmath152 , which is again a typical value for the kt regime as seen in fig .",
    "[ sigma_0 ] .",
    "performing then the switch at the later time @xmath149 ( and @xmath106 ) [ see figs  [ stress_switch]b ) and [ a1a2_switch]b ) ] , all of the displayed quantities become _",
    "constant_. this signals that we are entering a shear aligned ( a ) state , characterized by a shear rate of @xmath153 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the same a state is achievable with the choices @xmath148 and @xmath142 ( or @xmath117 ) . taken altogether , these results reveal that stress control can indeed stabilize the dynamics in systems characterized by unstable motion without control . moreover , the character of the final state is tunable by the details of the control scheme , that is in our case , the starting time of the stress control , and the corresponding delay time .",
    "in this article we have proposed a mesoscopic theory to investigate the orientational dynamics and rheology of sheared complex fluids at fixed , externally imposed shear stress @xmath0 .",
    "our strategy to control @xmath0 consists of supplementing the previously established equations of motion for the orientational order parameters @xcite by a relaxation equation for the shear rate , @xmath87 .",
    "the speed of this relaxation can be tuned by a control ( `` delay '' ) time .",
    "based on the resulting six - dimensional dynamical system we have numerically investigated sheared fluids of rod - like particles at several temperatures around the i - n transition at @xmath154 . at high temperatures , where the equilibrium system is isotropic , shear stress control yields the same asymptotic behavior ( that is , flow alignment ) as that encountered at fixed @xmath87 . within the low - temperature nematic phase , however , the control variable ( stress or strain ) influences both , the location and the _ type _ of bifurcations between different dynamic states .",
    "this finding is relevant not only from a theoretical point of view but also for experiments ; indeed , in rheological set - ups it is often the shear stress rather than the shear rate which can be fixed externally . in our model , the stress - controlled nematic fluid",
    "is characterized by only one non - equilibrium transition from a periodic ( kayaking - tumbling ) into a flow - aligned state , contrary to its @xmath87-controlled counterpart which displays , in addition , wagging and chaotic motion .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics at fixed stress is strongly influenced by the delay time @xmath5 .",
    "large values of the latter tend to damp oscillatory motion .",
    "moreover , the delay time can be used as a parameter to tune the position of the system s transition from a low-@xmath87 to a high-@xmath87 branch .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that our control scheme is capable of stabilizing regular ( periodic or stationary ) states out of chaotic orbits appearing at fixed @xmath87 .    in the present paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the investigation of spatially homogeneous states .",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification in view of experiments pointing to shear - induced inhomogeneities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as mentioned before , our approach is in principle fully capable of treating inhomogeneities as demonstrated , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the latter study dealing with a full three - dimensional spatially resolved flow problem .",
    "interestingly , there is a recent study of das _",
    "@xcite suggesting that the chaotic orientational behavior of our present system at constant @xmath87 transforms into a spatiotemporal chaos , when spatial fluctuations are allowed in the theory ( via gradient terms in the free energy ) .",
    "this suggests that the stress - controlled dynamics reported in present work may also be spatially extended .",
    "we note , however , that a full description of the spatially resolved problem would include _ feedback _ effects of the orientational motion on the flow @xcite ( which are neglected in @xcite , where @xmath87 was assumed to be a constant ) . given the complexity of the resulting numerical study we consider the present findings as first indicators for the true dynamics and as useful starting points for a more detailed investigation .",
    "a further interesting direction would be an extension of the present study towards polar systems @xcite .",
    "finally , the findings in the present study , particularly those regarding chaotic states , are also interesting in the broader context of control in non - linear dynamic systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is currently an intense research on systems such as lasers @xcite , neural systems @xcite , excitable media @xcite , and brownian ratchet systems @xcite , where unstable dynamic behavior is controlled via _ time - delayed feedback control _ ( tdas ) @xcite . in this framework",
    "the equations of motion are supplemented by ",
    "control force \" terms involving differences of an appropriate system variable ( or output quantity ) at a time @xmath155 and an earlier time @xmath156 .",
    "the control force thus vanishes when a specified stationary or periodic state is reached .",
    "this strategy is somewhat different from the present approach where the control is realized by an _",
    "additional _ equation of motion for the shear rate @xmath87 , which is varied until @xmath0 approaches an externally imposed value . despite these differences ,",
    "a common feature of our approach and the tdas method is that the time parameter ( @xmath119 or @xmath5 , respectively ) plays a crucial role for the asymptotic dynamics ( in fact , the present scheme could be viewed as feedback control with additional low - pass filtering involving an exponentially distributed delay @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in our model the actual value of @xmath5 decides which type of non - chaotic state the unstable system selects when starting the control within the chaotic regime .",
    "these similarities suggest that control concepts established in non - linear systems , such as tdas , may be very fruitful not only for a deeper understanding of the rheological properties , but also for the orientational dynamics .",
