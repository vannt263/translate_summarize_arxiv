    "one of the main characteristics of field theories defined in noncommutative space is the infrared / ultraviolet ( ir / uv ) mixing , which , even in models without massless particles , leads to the appearance of infrared divergences and , as a consequence , to the breakdown of the perturbative scheme in many renormalizable models ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the presence of infrared divergences in ordinary field theory signals that one may be expanding around a point of nonanaliticity of the exact solution .",
    "it may indicate the existence of nonperturbative effects that can not be reached by a power series expansion on the perturbative coupling .",
    "in such case , two possible approaches are envisaged .",
    "one may try resummations to rearrange the perturbative series to get a better behaved expansion .",
    "a difficulty in this method is the identification of a parameter to control different orders of the new series .",
    "another possible procedure is to enlarge the theory with new interactions , which , hopefully , will cancel the ir divergences leading to a new expansion without the mentioned singularities . for noncommutative theories",
    "both methods have been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that the resummation may be efficiently controlled by the wilsonian renormalization group , a la polchinski @xcite . on the other side",
    ", it has been shown that there exists a special class of theories , namely supersymmetric models , which are natural candidates to be consistent on noncommutative space , at least as far renormalization is concerned .",
    "this has been proved to be correct for the noncommutative versions of the four dimensional wess - zumino model @xcite and the three dimensional nonlinear sigma model @xcite to all orders and also , at least up to one - loop order , for some supersymmetric gauge models @xcite",
    ". however , noncommutative theories are so subtle and unusual that detailed investigations even in nonsupersymmetric theories are still in order .",
    "proceeding with the aforementioned investigations here we will study the noncommutative @xmath0 model . in this model local gauge invariance",
    "is attained through a composite field that , at least classically , is not dynamical .",
    "this simplifying aspect makes the model a good laboratory for the investigation of general properties of gauge fields in noncommutative space .",
    "the introduction of a gauge symmetry in noncommutative space produces a very rich structure in the sense that , even for the @xmath3 gauge group , there are three alternative ways in which the basic matter field could transform .",
    "we begin our study by considering here the pure @xmath0 model , i. e. , without fermionic matter fields .",
    "as it happens with its real @xmath4 symmetric counterpart , the nonlinear sigma model , only in two dimensions the commutative version of the model is perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "however , both in two and three space - time dimensions it is @xmath1 expandable @xcite .",
    "dynamical generation of gauge degrees of freedom and confinement are interesting aspects of the @xmath1 expansion of the two dimensional model @xcite . when coupled to fermions either minimally or in a supersymmetric fashion the quanta of the basic field @xmath5 are liberated and exact @xmath6 matrices are found @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional model also possesses some interesting properties .",
    "its @xmath1 expansion presents phases in which the basic fields are either massive or massless @xcite .",
    "in particular , if a chern - simons term is added @xcite one finds radiative corrections to the topological mass at the next to leading order of @xmath1 @xcite . in this study",
    "we will work in the unbroken phase ( massive @xmath2 ) of the 2 + 1 dimensional model .    in the noncommutative @xmath0 model ,",
    "because of the underlying noncommutativity , we may consider the basic field as belonging alternatively to a fundamental ( left or right ) or to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "we present a detailed discussion of the renormalization of the model in the fundamental representation up to the next to leading order of @xmath1 .",
    "the model turns out to be renormalizable but the existence of planar and nonplanar graphs with distinct uv behaviors unveils some interesting features . in particular , some graphs in the commutative case , as a consequence of charge conjugation do not contribute .",
    "however , these graphs in the noncommutative setting , where charge conjugation no longer holds @xcite , produces non null results . in spite of that , at least up to the leading nontrivial order of @xmath1 , the model turns out to be renormalizable and free of dangerous infrared divergences @xcite .    in contradistinction to the left fundamental representation , the adjoint representation , already at leading order , presents infrared singularities .",
    "the implications of these singularities are twofold . on one hand ,",
    "those divergences that occur in the gauge sector suggest the existence of strong long range forces . besides that , in the @xmath2 field self - energy corrections there are also quadratic infrared divergences which at higher order will destroy the @xmath1 expansion . it could be argued that , similarly to noncommutative @xmath7 @xcite , this behavior may be ameliorated by the inclusion of fermionic fields .",
    "this will be the subject of a subsequent paper where we will discuss the dynamical generation of a chern - simons term .",
    "the elimination of the ( dangerous ) ir / uv mixing in a supersymmetric extension of the model will be also investigated .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the possible representations for the noncommutative @xmath0 model are presented . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the leading contributions to the case in which the basic field belongs to the left fundamental representation and proceed a detailed examination of both the uv and ir divergences up to the next to leading order of @xmath1 .",
    "dimensional regularization is used and we prove that the model is free from dangerous divergences ( i. e. , nonrenormalizable or nonintegrable ir divergences are absent ) . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the behavior of the green functions when the basic fields belong to the adjoint representation .",
    "in this situation we explicitly verify the presence of ir / uv mixing which jeopardizes the consistency of the model . in sec .",
    "v we present some concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    "we discuss some additional properties of the model .",
    "the commutative cp@xmath8 model is specified by the lagrangian density    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , are complex scalar fields , @xmath11 is the covariant derivative of @xmath5 and @xmath12 an auxiliary gauge field ( classically it is just a convenient notation for the composite field @xmath13 ) ; @xmath14 is the lagrange multiplier field enforcing the constraint @xmath15 .",
    "because of this constraint , the presence of the mass term is classically not relevant . at the quantum level , @xmath16 will be identified with the physical mass for the quanta of the @xmath5 field insofar one enforces zero vacuum expectation value for the @xmath14 field .",
    "the discussion of this fact is entirely analogous to the one in the @xmath4 nonlinear sigma model and will not be pursued here @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative versions of the model are obtained by replacing the ordinary pointwise product by the moyal product @xcite which is associative and satisfies @xcite    @xmath17    where the constant and antisymmetric matrix @xmath18 gives a measure of the noncommutativity strength . to evade possible unitarity and/or causality problems @xcite we will keep @xmath19 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as the moyal ordered product is noncommutative , we shall investigate three possible representations for the matter field :    \\1 .",
    "left representation :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the gauge transformation function and    @xmath22    \\2 .",
    "right representation :    @xmath23    \\3 .",
    "adjoint representation :    @xmath24    to keep the action unchanged under these transformations , the usual derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives defined as    @xmath25    in all three above representations , the gauge field transforms as    @xmath26\\ast ( { \\textrm{e}}^{-i\\lambda } ) _ { \\ast } .",
    "\\label{4}\\ ] ]    for sake of simplicity , we shall restrict our analysis to the left and adjoint representations , as the analysis for right and left representations are very similar .",
    "in the left representation the part of the lagrangian containing the auxiliary field @xmath14 must be written either as    @xmath27    if @xmath14 does not change or    @xmath28    if @xmath14 changes according to the adjoint representation .",
    "if @xmath5 belongs to the adjoint representation then @xmath14 also belongs to this representation and the constraint part of the lagrangian should be of the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters . in",
    "what follows , no matter what representation for the @xmath5 field is adopted , we always assume that @xmath14 belongs to the adjoint representation . as shall be clear in the next section , a great advantage of this assignment is the independence of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 fields in the fundamental representation ( at the leading order of @xmath1 ) . with this choice ,",
    "the noncommutative action for the @xmath0 model in the left representation reads    @xmath34    as we will do shortly , to complete this lagrangian we shall add to it a gauge fixing and faddeev - popov terms .",
    "for the left fundamental representation our graphical notation prescribes the following feynman rules :    @xmath35    for the @xmath5 propagator and    @xmath36    for the vertices ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , where @xmath37 . except for some graphs containing the quadrilinear vertex ( [ n8 ] ) , in the left representation , new features associated with the noncommutativity are present only for graphs with more than two vertices",
    "this fact depends crucially on our choice for the @xmath32 field as belonging to the adjoint representation , which fixes the sign of the phase in ( [ n9 ] ) . in particular",
    ", the leading @xmath1 contribution for the mixed propagator @xmath38 is the same as in commutative situation and therefore vanishes , due to lorentz covariance .",
    "contrarily to the @xmath4 nonlinear sigma model , we will demonstrate that it is possible to construct a renormalizable model without nonintegrable ir / uv mixing . actually , we have :    \\a .",

    "it should be remarked also that the above propagator does not have poles and therefore does not have a particle content .",
    "gauge field two point proper function ( fig .",
    "[ fig1.0]b ) :    @xmath44(k^{2}-m^{2})}- \\frac{2g_{\\mu \\nu } } { k^{2}-m^{2}}\\right\\ } , \\ ] ]    which turns out to be finite if a gauge invariant regularization is adopted . indeed , using dimensional regularization",

    "the gauge field has a particle interpretation .",
    "indeed , @xmath47 so that for small momenta @xmath33 behaves as a maxwell field of intensity @xmath48 times the usual one . for large spacelike momenta    @xmath49    to get the propagator from ( [ 10 ] ) it is necessary to fix the gauge .",
    "we choose to work in the landau gauge by adding to the lagrangian ( [ 1a ] ) the term    @xmath50\\ ] ]    and letting @xmath51 after the calculation . notice the presence of the faddeev - popov ghost term , which due to the non abelian character of the moyal product does not decouple ( the ghost fields will not show up in our leading order calculations but will be relevant in higher orders ) .",
    "it is now straightforward to verify that the gauge field propagator is given by    @xmath52    as a last remark on the feynman rules notice that , as in the commutative theory , any graph containing the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig1.0 ] as subgraphs must be omitted since those ( sub ) graphs were already considered ( to construct the propagators for the @xmath33 and @xmath32 fields ) .    with these results at hand , we determine the ultraviolet degree of superficial divergence for a generic graph @xmath53 as being    @xmath54    where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the number of the external lines associated to the gauge , @xmath5 , @xmath14 and ghost fields , respectively .",
    "renormalization parts are those graphs having @xmath58 ; in a noncommutative theory they occur only for planar ( sub ) graphs . some of the ultraviolet divergences , associated with the planar graphs , may be absorbed by reparametrizations .",
    "as usual , we define the renormalized quantities by the replacements    @xmath59    so that the lagrangian ( [ 1a ] ) written in terms of the new fields changes as @xmath60 , where the counterterm lagrangian is given by    @xmath61    where we introduced @xmath62    these counterterms may be used to enforce @xmath16 as the physical mass of the @xmath2 field , to ensure the elimination of the remaining divergences of the two point function of the @xmath2 field and of the three point function @xmath63 .",
    "the analysis of the uv divergences is much facilitated by the help of the graphical identities @xcite depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] . due to the independence of the auxiliary field propagators on the noncommutative parameter ,",
    "these identities are valid also in the present situation .",
    "it should be observed that , as the @xmath32 field has no particle content , the identities may be used even if we restrict ourselves to the one particle irreducible graphs , i. e. , to graphs which can not be separated into disjoint pieces by cutting just one line , wavy or continuous . before going any further",
    "we would like to stress some important consequences of these identities .",

    "another implication of the graphical identity is that the @xmath64 counterterm is also innocuous if we consider green functions of the @xmath2 and @xmath33 fields only ( no external @xmath32 lines ) ; in that case @xmath65 may be chosen at will and the wave function renormalization for the @xmath32 field is therefore irrelevant . in our approach",

    "we also need to consider those divergences which do not have a corresponding counterterm .",
    "they may have @xmath66 equal to either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 , the dangerous divergences are associated with graphs with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . as mentioned earlier",
    ", this last possibility does not happen if a lorentz covariant regularization is employed .",
    "for @xmath72 there are more possibilities :    \\1 .",

    "besides the uv behavior , in all cases we need to investigate the possible presence of infrared divergences ( uv / ir mixing ) .",
    "we focus first on the processes whose corresponding counterterms are correlated by gauge invariance , namely , corrections for the @xmath2 propagator , the three point @xmath80 and the four point @xmath81 functions .",
