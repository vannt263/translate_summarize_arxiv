    "since the detection of the large - angle temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite  @xcite , many cmb measurements have reported detections or upper limits of the cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum @xmath0 over a wide range of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "recently , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite has measured the @xmath0 in an unprecedented accuracy for @xmath2 and thus made a precise estimation of a number of cosmological parameters .",
    "polarization of the cmb contains a wealth of information about the early universe as well .",
    "it can cross - check the measured @xmath0 and improve the accuracy in determining the cosmological parameters .",
    "a cmb polarization field can be decomposed into an electric - type @xmath3 mode and a magnetic - type @xmath4 mode  @xcite . recently ,",
    "the dasi instrument , a ground - based interferometric array with degree - scale resolution , has detected the cmb @xmath3 polarization and @xmath5 cross - correlation , while setting an upper limit on the @xmath4 polarization  @xcite . furthermore , the wmap has measured the @xmath5 power spectrum  @xcite , which is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the measured cmb anisotropy and indicates a significant large - scale @xmath3 polarization .",
    "measuring the cmb polarization has become one of the main goals of cmb experiments  @xcite .",
    "future ground - based and balloon - borne experiments and the planck satellite will unveil detailed features of the cmb anisotropies , thus allowing one to determine to a high precision the cosmological parameters .    as high - resolution data made by high - sensitivity cmb experiments comes along , it will be necessary to consider the effect of beam asymmetry in data analysis in order to make unbiased estimation of the power spectra and ultimately of the cosmological parameters .",
    "this effect , mainly caused by the off - axis position of the detector in the focal plane of the telescope , is small and so far has been largely neglected in cmb data analysis .",
    "recently , the effect of beam asymmetry has been investigated .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite have shown that the typical difference due to beam asymmetry is of few @xmath6 in planck configuration and increases with the beamwidth and ellipticity  @xcite and that an azimuthally symmetrized beam does not bias the power spectrum estimates for most practical situations  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a fast convolution algorithm based on the decomposition of the asymmetric beam as a sum of circular gaussian functions is developed .",
    "on the other hand , analytic methods have been formulated for treating arbitrary asymmetric beams in full - sky cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy experiments by using spin - weighted spherical harmonics  @xcite and wigner d - functions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have pointed out that for asymmetric beam functions the result of convolutions is on the group manifold of the three - dimensional rotation and provided an algorithm for fast computation of the convolution on this group manifold .",
    "this method has been applied to study the effect of an elliptical gaussian beam in the estimation of temperature and polarization correlation functions using semi - analytic or full numerical integration  @xcite and a perturbative series in powers of the ellipticity parameter  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the effect of beam asymmetry in full - sky cmb single - dish as well as interferometry experiments .",
    "we will derive the full - sky convolution for a complex asymmetric beam and define the measured temperature and polarization anisotropies globally on the group manifold of the three - dimensional rotation by using wigner d - functions  @xcite .",
    "as such , we can extend the standard anisotropy and polarization correlation functions of domain over the celestial sphere to those over the rotation group manifold .",
    "the result is then applied to calculate the full - sky correlation functions for two typical cases : an elliptical gaussian beam and an interferometric gaussian beam .",
    "the former is a good approximation to the actual shape of the window in most of cmb single - dish experiments and the latter is maximally asymmetric due to the finite length of the baseline of the interferometer",
