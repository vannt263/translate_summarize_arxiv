    "in the last years , noncommutative theories have been discussed in the literature by a large number of authors , mainly due to the discovery of their relation to string theory @xcite .",
    "noncommutative field theories were obtained by replacing the usual product of fields by the moyal product ( star product ) . because of the properties of star product , the quadratic part in the action is the same as in the commutative case , with only interaction terms are modified .",
    "consequently , the free propagator is not changed after introducting of the star product .",
    "the inherent nonlocality of these theories leads to the surprising mixture between ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences which could break the perturbative expansion . besides",
    ", the feynman diagrams turn out to exhibit the same ( up to the numerical coefficients ) ultraviolet divergences as in the commutative case .    to avoid difficulties with the uv / ir mixing ,",
    "recently , a new approach was developed in @xcite to study the noncommutative space - time .",
    "this new formalism is based on the coherent state approach , instead of moyal product approach , and is explicitly ultraviolet finite . in this approach",
    "the free propagators acquire a gaussian damping factor , which incorporates @xmath0 as a natural cutoff at large momenta . in @xcite",
    "this formalism was applied for the nonrelativistic scalar field theory .",
    "it was shown that this theory is ultraviolet finite on a quantum plane at the one - loop level .",
    "in particular , the divergent behavior of the model has been regained in the limit @xmath1 , i.e. , when the noncommutativity of the coordinates is removed .    in this work",
    "we will apply the coherent states approach to the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect in the noncommutative plane . in quantum field theory , this effect represents itself essentially as the scattering of spin zero particles through a chern - simons ( cs ) field .",
    "it is well - known that , in the commutative situation @xcite , the quartic self - interaction is necessary to ensure the renormalizability of the model . in the context of the moyal product based noncommutative nonrelativistic field theory @xcite ,",
    "it has been shown that up to the one - loop order the uv divergences of the planar contributions are canceled for the four - point function .",
    "on the other hand , to remove logarithmic infrared divergences originating from the non - planar diagrams in the commutative limit , it was necessary to introduce a quartic self - interaction to the lagrangian .",
    "we show that up to the one - loop order the scattering amplitude is ultraviolet finite . at the same time , the amplitude involves logarithmic singularities as the noncommutative parameter tends to zero . to eliminate them",
    ", it is necessary to include a quartic self - interaction for the scalar field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the coherent state approach to the noncommutative plane . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the model and we compute the particle - particle scattering up to order one loop .",

    "the mean position of the particle over the noncommutative plane is defined as @xmath13 thus , to any operator @xmath14 we associate an ordinary function @xmath15 through their mean values as follows : @xmath16    mean values of any operator over coherent states are commutative quantities upon which one can construct usual quantum field theory .",
    "it is very natural to expect that presence of the exponential factors in the propagator would imply in the uv finiteness of the corresponding field theory @xcite .",

    "the choose of the lower or upper sign in ( [ ampl ] ) , corresponding to a attractive or repulsive quartic self - interaction .",
    "it is instructive to compare the scattering amplitude ( [ ampl ] ) obtained within the coherent state approach with the results obtained for the scattering amplitude within the moyal product approach @xcite .",

    "both amplitudes turn out to be free of any singularities at some critical relations of couplings , those are @xmath70 within the coherent state approach and @xmath71 within the moyal state approach .",
    "thus we find that both approaches display the similar qualitative behaviour in the commutative limit . at the same time",
    ", we find that these amplitudes are different in some minor aspects . in the tree approximation and to first order in @xmath29",
    "our model does not present noncommutative correction whereas in @xcite it was shown a constant noncommutative contribution to the two body scattering .",
    "furthermore , for small scattering angle @xmath31 , the noncommutative correction obtained in this paper shows a @xmath72 dependence whereas in ( [ loopm ] ) this dependence is @xmath73 .",
    "also , we found that the third term in ( [ ampl ] ) gives an constant noncommutative correction and this contribution does not present in ( [ loopm ] ) .",
    "however , these differences are quite natural being caused by use of different regularization and approximation schemes and by the different fashions of introduction of noncommutativity in two formulations of the theory , whereas the main feature , that is , absence of singularities at some certain relation of couplings , is observed in both theories .",
    "in this paper we have formulated the coherent state approach for the noncommutative ab scattering . in analogy with the noncommutative moyal ab scattering",
    "@xcite we observe that the total scattering amplitude is uv finite .",
    "this happens due to arise of the natural cut - off that appears in coherent state approach while in the noncommutative moyal we have uv and uv / ir singularities we need to implement the method of regularition in a conventional way introducing an ad hoc cut - off which has nothing to do with the parameter .",
    "we show that noncommutative aharonov - bohm scattering amplitude obtained by using of the coherent state approach in the commutative limit agrees with the commutative result @xcite .",
    "this is a solid argument for consistency of the method used in this paper .",
    "moreover , we have found that the principal physical conclusions , those are about absence of singularities to critical couplings , are valid both within the coherent state approach and the moyal product approach .",
    "the problem of choice of the preferable approach between moyal product formulation and the coherent states formulation needs special studies similarly to the problem of choice between moyal product and seiberg - witten map @xcite .",
    "let us also make some comments .",
    "first , we would note that the purely spacial character of the noncommutativity is essential for providing the unitarity of the theory , with the similar situation takes place in the relativistic moyal - product based theories @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the relativistic generalization of the coherent state method @xcite allows to provide unitarity without introducing privileged role of time .",
    "second , we can prove that the noncommutative corrections in the theory display exponential decay as distance grows .",
    "indeed , the typical contributions arising within this approach , similar to ( [ tri],[box ] ) , after integration in the internal momentum @xmath74 but before of the expansion in power series in @xmath0 , display the behaviour @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the external momentum , and @xmath77 is a some integer number .",
    "let us transform this expression to the coordinate space .",
    "we get @xmath78 which after integration , for @xmath79 , gives @xmath80 we see that the @xmath0 dependent term representing itself as a noncommutative correction , first , vanishes at @xmath81 , second , exponentially decreases as distance grows .",
    "so we conclude that the noncommutative corrections are highly suppressed with the distance .",
