    "multilayers built from ferromagnetic layers with various spacer layers include a wide variety of magnetic film systems that have been intensively studied during last years . due to remarkable phenomena as giant magnetoresistance ,",
    "exchange - spring behaviour and/or exchange bias , and surface enhanced magnetic anisotropy , such nanostructures have already found a number of applications and are considered as promising candidates for nonvolatile magnetic recording media.@xcite on the other hand , nanoscale superlattices and similar structures provide convenient model systems to study different aspects of surface magnetism and magnetic ordering in confining geometry .    in particular , much attention has been given to multilayers composed of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic nanolayers .",
    "@xcite such layered synthetic antiferromagnets can be separated into two classes according to the symmetries ruling their magnetic properties : superlattices with relatively strong uniaxial anisotropies include low - symmetry multilayers with effective uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the layer planes , e.g. epitaxial systems deposited on ( 110 ) , ( 211 ) faces of cubic substrates.@xcite also multilayer systems with perpendicular anisotropy belong to this class.@xcite magnetization processes in these nanostructures are strongly influenced by the uniaxial anisotropy which is responsible for specific phenomena such as `` surface spin - flop '' @xcite or field - induced metamagnetic jumps.@xcite on the other hand , the uniaxial anisotropy may be absent in layered systems with higher symmetry .",
    "these represent another large and intensively investigated class of synthetic antiferromagnetic nanostructures .",
    "superlattices with planar magnetization grown on ( 001 ) faces of cubic substrates , e.g. multilayers from materials combinations as co / cu @xcite , fe / si @xcite co / cr , @xcite or fe / cr , @xcite belong to this class . in the case of weak four - fold anisotropy , their magnetic properties are mostly determined by the interlayer exchange interactions which may include an important _ biquadratic _ contribution .",
    "@xcite evidence of strong biquadratic exchange interaction has been given in a number of experimental papers for fe / cr two - layers and multilayers @xcite , for fe / si(001 ) multilayers @xcite ) .",
    "strong effective four - fold anisotropies have been found in systems such as co / cr(001 ) or fe / cr(001 ) .",
    "@xcite the competition between magnetic anisotropy , applied fields and exchange energies may cause complicated magnetic effects and processes .",
    "in fact , a great number of novel magnetic configurations and remarkable reorientational effects in external fields have been found in such superlattices .",
    "@xcite in particular , recent experimental results using modern depth - resolving techniques reveal spatially inhomogeneous magnetic structures , e.g. in fe / cr(001 ) superlattices,@xcite and specific reorientation effects imposed by four - fold planar ( tetragonal ) anisotropy.@xcite the understanding and interpretation of the complex magnetization processes found in such systems @xcite requires a theoretical underpinning .",
    "theoretical activity in this field is largely based on analytical and numerical calculations mostly within phenomenological approaches .",
    "@xcite these studies have demonstrated the general validity of the phenomenological models to describe the magnetization processes in antiferromagnetic nanostructures .",
    "@xcite for the system under discussion the phenomenological theory has been developed to describe effects of 90  degree couplings and a concomitant complex evolution of domain structures in fe / cr / fe layers.@xcite four - fold anisotropy effects have been theoretically investigated in ref .   for sandwich structures with @xmath2=2 ferromagnetic layers coupled through a spacer .",
    "multilayer systems provide also experimental models to study effects of the confining surfaces on antiferromagnetic structures.@xcite in this context , specific inhomogeneous magnetic states described for theoretical models in ref .  , have recently been observed in fe / cr superlattices.@xcite the existing theoretical results , however , are restricted to special cases and are not sufficient for an exhaustive description of the magnetic states and field - induced reorientional effects observed in recent experiment .",
    "@xcite in this paper we provide a theoretical analysis of magnetic states and magnetization processes in planar antiferromagnetic superlattices with and without four - fold anisotropy in magnetic fields applied within the multilayer plane . in such magnetic superlattices",
    "the exchange interlayer coupling is an oscillatory function of the spacer thickness.@xcite depending on the spacer thickness an alternating sequence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interlayer couplings is realized , and , by adjusting the spacer thicknesses , very different strengths of antiferromagnetic coupling can be realized .",
    "on the other hand , the four - fold anisotropy includes interface - induced contributions which implies a strong dependency of the effective average anisotropy of each ferromagnetic layer on the layer thickness.@xcite thus , the effective magnetic interactions can vary in extremely broad ranges for such multilayers in dependence on the chosen materials combinations and thicknesses , see e.g. ref .  , where for a co / cu(001 ) two - layer system with a wedged spacer layer the ratio between four - fold anisotropy energy and the exchange coupling is changed by orders of magnitude . in contrast to bulk planar antiferromagnets , where an essentially fixed hierarchy for the strengths of the magnetic interactions holds,@xcite in these artificial antiferromagnetic systems the ratios between different magnetic energies , respectively the phenomenological parameters in the magnetic free - energy , may assume practically arbitrary values .",
    "moreover , as the interlayer exchange is weak compared to direct exchange interactions , the fields to induce spin - reorientation phenomena are similarly weak and experimentally accessible .",
    "the rich phase diagrams for these systems precludes an analysis in all details .",
    "the phase space in terms of the phenomenological parameters includes a large variety of different magnetic states with a corresponding multitude of spontaneous and field - induced phase - transformations . in a first step to such an analysis ,",
    "all laterally homogeneous states in such multilayers must be found .",
    "they are the building blocks for a domain theory.@xcite for the case of laterally homogeneous states of each ferromagnetic sublayer one has a system that behaves like an antiferromagnetically coupled chain of stoner - wohlfarth particles .",
    "this simplified one - dimensional model for the behaviour across the multilayer stack also yields the limiting case for the magnetization processes with maximum hystereses .",
    "again , a direct analysis of all magnetic states even for these one - dimensional models yields an intricate succession of phase diagrams and magnetization curves.@xcite in this paper , we avoid the cumbersome task of listing and classifying _ all _ solutions and transitions . instead , we provide a broad physically intuitive picture of the physical effects due to the different exchange or anisotropic forces , and those imposed by the confining geometry of the system . to this end",
    ", we study limiting cases of the model .",
    "this includes the case of strictly zero anisotropy with and without biquadratic exchange , and the case of infinite anisotropy with fixed four - fold orientation of the magnetizations in each layer . for the antiferromagnetic two - layer systems ( @xmath2=2 ) , i.e. the sandwich structures ( experimentally realized as ferromagnetic / spacer / ferromagnetic trilayers )",
    ", we provide a detailed investigation of the magnetic phase - diagram for arbitrary orientation of fields in the layer planes .",
    "based on this , we can understand the _ basic _ magnetic configurations in the multilayers , and we can give a map of the _ topologically different types _ of magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "we use standard methods to analyse magnetic phases and transitions within the phenomenological approach and the theory of phase transitions.@xcite the one - dimensional chain models are considered as composite order - parameters with many components ( @xmath2 components in a multilayer stack composed of @xmath2 ferromagnetic / spacer bilayers ) and a characteristic structure of couplings between the components defined by interlayer exchange and the surfaces . from this point of view , the very rich phase - diagrams and correspondingly complex sequences of magnetic configurations can be understood . for the general cases of the model",
    ", the equations for equilibrium and phase stability can be solved only by numerical methods . with the methods and results expounded below , one can extend the analysis to specific experimental cases in all detail .",
    "the solutions for the one - dimensional chain models include various field - induced canted and inhomogeneous states with a net magnetization .",
    "based on the phase diagrams of these models , the evolution of laterally inhomogeneous ( domain ) states and magnetization processes can be discussed.@xcite in this connection , the coexistence regions of different phases in the vicinity of discontinuous ( first - order ) magnetic phase transitions are important .",
    "in external fields , thermodynamically stable domain - configuration from these competing phases can be established in extended multilayers this is crucial for an understanding of the hysteretic magnetization processes under coercivity mechanisms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the model and mathematical tools ( sec .",
    "ii ) we consider the effects of the bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions in the next section ( sec .",
    "iii ) . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate in detail four - fold anisotropy effects in antiferromagnetically coupled two - layers and then discuss the generalization of these finding to the case of multilayers . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss domain states and magnetization processes by using qualitative arguments . in the concluding",
    "part we discuss possible extensions of the theory , and we suggest some useful experiments to enhance our understanding of magnetization processes in antiferromagnetic superlattices .",
    "let us consider a stack of @xmath2 ferromagnetic plates infinite in @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions and with finite thickness along @xmath5-axis .",
    "the magnetization of the layers is @xmath6 , and there are indirect interlayer - exchange couplings through spaces between them .",
    "the phenomenological energy of the system can be written in the following form    @xmath7 -\\mathbf{h}\\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\zeta_i \\mathbf{m}_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n } k_i\\left ( \\mathbf{m}_x^4   + \\mathbf{m}_y^4 \\right )   \\label{energy1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are unity vectors along the @xmath10-th layer magnetization . @xmath11",
    "designate deviations of the magnetization in the @xmath10-th layer from the averaged value @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that @xmath13=0 , i.e. the layer magnetizations are restricted to the layer plane . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants of bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions , respectively ; @xmath16 are constants of the in - plane four - fold anisotropy .",
    "the functional ( [ energy1 ] ) generalizes similar models considered earlier in a number of studies on exchange @xcite and anisotropy @xcite effects in planar antiferromagnetic systems . within this approach the ferromagnetic layers are considered as homogeneously magnetized blocks with constant values of the magnetic interactions .",
    "this assumption deserves some comment .",
    "it is well - established that in magnetic nanostructures surface / interface exchange and relativistic interactions strongly modify electronic and magnetic properties within all volume of the magnetic constituents @xcite .",
    "this means that the values of the exchange or anisotropy parameters , and the magnetizations include large interface / surface - induced components which may strongly vary across the thickness of the individual layers.@xcite however , the hypothesis of magnetic homogeneity in the ferromagnetic nanolayers in the models of type ( [ energy1 ] ) has a solid physical basis and is justified by successful applications of these models to describe magnetization processes in layered ferro- and antiferromagnetic nanostructures.@xcite this relies on the fact that in ferromagnetic nanolayers the intrinsic ( direct ) exchange coupling are usually very strong and overcome surface / interface induced interactions .",
    "thus , they play the dominating role to determine the magnetic order _ within _ the layers , which reacts also very stiffly on all external and induced magnetic forces . furthermore , in these planar systems the stray field forces confine the magnetization of the layers into their plane . as a result ,",
    "in most of these systems the ferromagnetic layers preserve essentially homogeneous in - plane magnetized states even under the influence of strongly inhomogeneous induced interactions.@xcite in this connection it is important to stress here that the materials parameters in the phenomenological model ( [ energy1 ] ) should be treated as averages over a multilayer _",
    "period_. they comprise ( in integral form ) all intrinsic and induced energy contributions of the magnetic states in the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "in particular , for the systems under consideration they may also include a contribution from magnetism of the spacer layers .",
    "thus , in contrast to their bulk counterparts which are considered as constants of the magnetic material , in nanoscale multilayer systems the phenomenological parameters strongly depend on many physical and geometrical factors and may considerably vary from sample to sample .",
    "parity of @xmath2 also plays an important role .",
    "the model ( [ energy1 ] ) with _ even _ number of ferromagnetic layers represents systems with fully compensated magnetization .",
    "such superlattices can be treated as analogues to bulk collinear antiferromagnets .",
    "superlattices with odd numbers of layers or with unequal thicknesses of layers own a noncompensated magnetization which strongly determines their global magnetic properties . in their response to an applied field , these structures are similar to bulk ferrimagnets . they could be studied by similar methods as used below , but have to be considered as separate class of systems . concentrating on the properties of systems with fully compensated total magnetization , we consider only superlattices with even @xmath2 and equal magnetization in all layers ( @xmath17 ) . in this contribution dedicated to general properties of these antiferromagnetic superlattices ,",
    "we avoid secondary effects which are related to their micro - structure and interface properties , such as strains , chemical intermixing etc . with",
    "that in view we will study the model ( [ energy1 ] ) mainly for the case of _ identical _ ferromagnetic layers assuming that the exchange and anisotropy constants are equal for all the layers , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "some of the analytical results can be generalized to the isotropic ( i. e. with @xmath21 ) system with mirror symmetry about the center of the layer stack , i.e.  @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in our problem",
    "the magnetization of the _ i_th layer is confined in planar orientations and can be described by the angle @xmath24 between the vector @xmath25 and @xmath3-axis .",
    "thus , calculations of the magnetic states for the model ( [ energy1 ] ) can be reduced to the optimization of the function @xmath26 .",
    "following the theory of bulk antiferromagnetism it is convenient to introduce here the vectors of the _ total magnetization _ @xmath27 and the _ staggered _ ( or _ antiferromagnetism _ ) vector @xmath28 @xmath29 the energy ( [ energy1 ] ) is invariant under transformation @xmath30 , and , therefore , all magnetic states in this model are degenerate with respect to the sign of the staggered vectors . in the following only solutions with a definite sign of the staggered vector",
    "will be discussed .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the full set of solutions includes also those with opposite sign of @xmath28 . the magnetic states with opposite sign of @xmath28 behave identically in an applied magnetic field .",
    "thus , for the magnetization processes there is no need to distinguish these solutions .    for the particular case of a two - layer ( @xmath0 )",
    "the energy ( [ energy1 ] ) can be transformed to the following form @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the angle between the @xmath35 and the @xmath3-axis .",
    "this case of a two - layer is of special interest .",
    "the energy ( [ energy2 ] ) functionally coincides with that of a bulk two - sublattice antiferromagnet .",
    "this offers the opportunity for useful physical relations and analogies with bulk antiferromagnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - layers represent the simplest model of antiferromagnetically coupled layered nanostructures .",
    "the equations minimizing the function @xmath26 have strongly nonlinear character and no analytical solution are available generally .",
    "the body of our results have been obtained by numerical methods .",
    "we solve the coupled equations for equilibria @xmath36 by an efficient conjugate gradient minimization.@xcite for systems with large anisotropy the configurations with the magnetizations oriented in the four - fold easy - axis directions are close to mostly metastable minima of the energy .",
    "these configurations have been systematically searched for global absolute stability and checked for stability .",
    "numerically , this is feasible for @xmath2 not too large with present day computers .",
    "stability limits and phase - transitions are determined from the evolution of the smallest eigenvalue @xmath37 of the stability matrix @xmath38 under changing parameters in ( [ energy1 ] ) , i.e. ratios @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or the applied magnetic field .",

    "the magnetic states for the isotropic two - layer ( @xmath0 ) in the applied field can be obtained by minimization of the energy ( [ energy2 ] ) with @xmath44 . the solutions ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) describe the states with the staggered vector perpendicular to the applied field ( so called _ spin - flop _ ( sf )",

    "[ hxhyinfinite2 ] is valid only for the case of equal exchange constants @xmath257 in the multilayer stack . for arbitrary sets of values for @xmath14 in energy ( [ energy1 ] )",
    "the phase diagrams may become considerably more complex and may contain further phases with different combinations of flipped 90 and 180 degree spin - pairs . even in such cases ,",
    "the outline of the magnetic phase - diagrams , described here for finite equal - constant superlattices , should generally hold : ( i ) the high anisotropy limit is comparably simple with few phases determined by the competing lowest - energy basins of the anisotropy .",
    "non - equal constants may lift some degeneracies that are present in superlattices .",
    "( ii ) in intermediate anisotropy range many elastically distorted phases appear , which are derived from stable and metastable high - anisotropy phases .",
    "( iii ) for vanishing anisotropy the phase - diagrams become simple again as only inhomogeneous spin - flop - like phases and the saturated ferromagnetic phase remain in external fields .",
    "so far , we have analyzed single domain magnetic configurations .",
    "magnetization processes in real systems , however , are usually accompanied by complex reconstruction of the multidomain patterns as those recently observed in fe / cr multilayers.@xcite    there are two main physical mechanism for multidomain states in the systems under discussion .",
    "four - fold degeneracy of the ground - state leads to creation of _ antiferromagnetic multidomain structures _ with 90 degree domain walls . unlike the case of magnetic materials with nonzero total magnetization , where multidomain states are caused by demagnetization effects , in antiferromagnets",
    "such domains are _ metastable _ and arise during the formation of the ordering state , i.e. they have a kinetic origin.@xcite hence , multidomain patterns observed in antiferromagnetic coupled two - layers and multilayers have irregular morphologies and depend on thermal and magnetic - field histories.@xcite    however , another type of multidomain structures arises in the vicinity of field - induced discontinuous transitions.@xcite such thermodynamically stable _ transitional domain structures _ are formed by domains from states corresponding to the coexisting phases at first - order transitions .",
    "these domains are analogous to the domains of a demagnetized ferromagnet . in principle , the equilibrium parameters of such multidomain structures and their boundaries can be calculated by standard methods.@xcite in @xcite such calculations have been carried out for bulk easy - plane tetragonal antiferromagnets . _ magnetoelastic interactions _ lead to modification of the inhomogeneous states and",
    "decrease the regions of the multidomain states up to their complete suppression.@xcite this and other coercivity mechanism partly block the development of the equilibrium states . as a result , in real systems",
    "the evolution of multidomain states @xcite is accompanied by rather strong hystereses.@xcite for experiments , there are two important consequences related to the starting states and history dependence of magnetization processes .",
    "the `` texture '' of a real antiferromagnetic state in zero - field depends on the detailed kinetics imposed by e.g. cooling rates or deposition conditions . on the other hand , field cycling by inner loops for an antiferromagnetic multilayer may yield various metastable configurations and multidomain structures owing to the very wide coexistence region of the domains whenever sizable magnetic anisotropies are present in the multilayer stack",
    "within a phenomenological approach we develop the theory of reorientation transition in antiferromagnetically coupled superlattices with in - plane magnetization .",
    "detailed investigations of the surface effects in the isotropic multilayers ( sec .",
    "iii ) and four - fold anisotropy effects in two - layer systems ( sec .",
    "iv ) reveal the most important features of the system : ( i ) complex evolution of the inhomogeneous states ( figs .  2 - 4 )",
    "is imposed by the strong disbalance of the exchange coupling , i.e. by the _ cut of the exchange bonds_. ( ii ) remarkable field - induced reorientational processes occur due to enhanced four - fold anisotropy ( figs .",
    "8 to [ mvshn8 ] ) .",
    "the model used here , corresponding solutions and phase - diagrams include as special cases earlier theoretical studies on surface @xcite and four - fold anisotropy @xcite effects .",
    "the results are in essential accordance with existing experimental observations on inhomogeneous distribution in the spin - flop phase near the saturation field @xcite , and some effects of four - fold anisotropy in co / cu(001 ) wedged two - layers @xcite and fe / cr superlattices.@xcite our approach and results enable a _ qualitative _ analysis of the magnetization processes in the multilayered systems ( sec .",
    "v ) . in spite of the rather complex phase - diagrams of these systems",
    ", the analysis can be extended towards a quantitative description of real systems belonging to the class of artificial layered antiferromagnets described by eq .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) .    so far most experimental work",
    "is carried out only for special conditions , often data are collected only with fields along easy - axes .",
    "these results only cover small regions of the ( @xmath258,@xmath259)-phase diagrams ( figs .  [ hxhyweak ] to [ hxhyinfinite2 ] ) and do not capture the rich varieties of magnetizations processes in such systems .",
    "it is remarkable that many interesting effects , such as 90-degree folded phases , transitions into asymmetric canted phases etc .",
    ", are present already in antiferromagnetically coupled two - layers.@xcite as we have seen , phase diagrams for multilayer systems with @xmath260 become very complex .",
    "hence , systems with few layers are probably a better starting point for detailed investigations on magnetization processes . such experiments could be used to assess magnetic parameters and quality of such systems .",
    "generally , magnetization processes and checks for their dependence on magnetic and thermal pre - history should be made by applying fields in oblique directions and/or under rotating fields . only then",
    ", the behaviour of the ( @xmath258,@xmath259)-phase diagrams can be usefully compared with detailed theoretical investigations .",
    "further theoretical work may address models with non - equal constants .",
    "also effectively ferrimagnetic systems with odd numbers @xmath2 of layers and with different layer thicknesses may be interesting .",
    "some experimental data for magnetization processes in such systems exist , e.g. for co / cr two - layers with different ferromagnetic layers thicknesses,@xcite and for odd - numbered multilayers.@xcite interesting reorientational effects should arise also in magnetic fields , which are applied perpendicular or under arbitrary angle to the layer plane .",
    "antiferromagnetically coupled superlattices may also undergo transitions into perpendicularly magnetized states for certain thicknesses of the individual ferromagnetic layers , as observed for co / cr(001).@xcite in such cases the stray field must be taken into account already for laterally homogeneous states .",
    "concluding we state that the magnetic effects and phenomena discussed in this paper can be used for detailed investigations on such aspects of nanomagnetism as interlayer - exchange interactions , reorientational , and multidomain processes .",
