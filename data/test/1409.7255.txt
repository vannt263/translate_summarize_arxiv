    "in detection statistics , the relation between the average number of counts during a detection time @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the fluctuations around this value , expressed by the variance @xmath2-@xmath3 , i.e. the variance to mean ratio    q^2 ~    is often used to characterise the statistics of the particle field detected .",
    "for instance in the case of neutrons emitted from a radioactive source following a simple poisson statistics , this ratio is obviously equal to unity .",
    "however , for a neutron chain in a multiplying medium , such as a subcritical reactor with a source or a fissile sample with an inherent neutron source due to spontaneous fission , the branching character represented by the fission process has the consequence that the individual detections will not be independent , rather positive correlations exist between them . hence the variance to mean ratio is larger than unity , and the deviation from unity carries information on the medium in which the branching process ( neutron multiplication ) took place .",
    "this fact was used by feynman and de hoffmann in 1944 - 1956 @xcite for the derivation of a formula for a branching process where the variance to mean was above unity , @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5-function became called the feynman y - function , characterising the deviation of the relative variance from unity .",
    "both its time dependence , expressed by the prompt neutron decay constant @xmath6 , as well as its asymptotic value , carry information on the sought parameters of the system .",
    "the original application of these studies was related to the theoretical description of statistical fluctuations of the number of neutrons in multiplying medium or in other words , to the determination of the level of subcriticality .",
    "therefore , the above - mentioned research remained classified for several years .",
    "the fundamental principles of the feynman - alpha theory have been extensively described in a number of publications , e.g. @xcite .",
    "about a decade ago the interest to this subject returned again in connection to the on - line measurement of subcritical reactivity of accelerator - driven systems ( ads ) . whereas the original feynman - alpha formulas referred to a homogeneous system in an monoenergetic ( `` one - group '' ) description @xcite , dealing only with one exponent or decay constant , the further experiments , e.g. the yalina @xcite and muse @xcite , showed the appearance of more than one decay constant and , therefore , the possible need of extension of the one - group one - region ( also referred to as `` one - point '' ) feynman - alpha formulas to more energy groups and spatial regions .",
    "several attempts were made towards the explanation of multiple exponential modes by the spatial effects @xcite . by that time",
    "it was decided that the future ads - systems will be driven by pulsed neutron and spallation sources which lead to the extension of the theory of variance - to - mean formulas for a continuous source with poisson statistics to the cases of pulsed and spallation neutron sources with different definition of the pulse shapes and pulsing manner @xcite .",
    "latter analysis @xcite showed the close link between the application of feynman - alpha formulas to subcriticality measurements and safeguards .    in line with the above , the suggestion of new safeguards technique for mox / spent fuel assay @xcite , the differential die - away self - interrogation ( ddsi ) technique , displayed the interest towards the energy - dependent aspects of neutron counting . in connection with this ,",
    "the two - group feynman - alpha theory was elaborated in @xcite where delayed neutrons were neglected , and in @xcite with inclusion of delayed neutron precursors .",
    "however , fast fission and thermal detections were neglected in both papers .",
    "the results of further considerations of the importance of the energy - aspect in evaluation of the real systems shows that `` a measured variance - to - mean ratio in fast systems may be contaminated by the energy - higher order mode effect except when the system is near - critical @xcite '' .    in the light of recent advances in detector technologies in safeguards towards the development of",
    "fast neutron detection systems with scintillators , the knowledge of the energy - dependent behavior of neutron counting became a very important issue to be taken into account in feynman - alpha theory .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that the short and long time behavior of the @xmath7-function can be used to assay the amount of @xmath8pu and the absolute amount of @xmath9pu+@xmath10pu in the reprocessed fuel .",
    "therefore , one part of this paper is devoted to the derivation of the general case of one - point two - group feynman - alpha formulas , when fast fission and thermal detections and delayed neutrons are included . however in some cases , for example",
    ", when the fission chambers are used as detectors , the energy importance makes way for the region - dependent aspect .",
    "this issue has not well been studied previously , although some expressions for the one - group two - region feynman - alpha formulas can be found in @xcite . however",
    ", even these investigations are limited to the case of delayed neutron precursors having been neglected and detections accounted for only in one region .",
    "thus , the second part of this paper is devoted to the derivation of the general case of the two - point one - group feynman - alpha formulas , when detections and delayed neutrons are accounted for in both regions .",
    "it has to be noted that the present paper does not carry out fully an analysis of the diagnostic value of the obtained formulas the same way as it was made in the traditional works based on a one - group treatment in a single ( infinite ) homogeneous medium . in the traditional case",
    "the time dependence of the feynman @xmath5 function is characterised essentially with one decay constant which can clearly be related to the subcriticality of the system . in the case of using two energy groups and two spatial regions , the number of decay constants increases and each of them becomes a much more involved function of the increased number of material properties ( reaction intensities ) that the treatment of different regions and energy intervals incurs .",
    "the sought system parameters become very involved functions of these decay constants , and no attempt is made in this paper on the investigation of how these parameters can be extracted from the measurements .",
    "this is deferred to later work .",
    "the objective of the present work is to give a clear and transparent derivation of the various variance - to - mean formulas as functions of the reaction and transition intensities , and to compare the solutions for the different cases .",
    "in this paper , the two - point two - group , the two - group one - point ( with delay neutrons ) and the one - group two - point ( with delayed neutrons ) feynman - alpha formulas were derived by using the kolmogorov forward approach @xcite . in the general model used for derivations",
    "we assume that the neutron population consists of two groups of neutrons : fast ( denoted as 1 ) and thermal ( denoted as 2 ) .",
    "fast and thermal neutrons can undergo different reactions ( i ) listed below :    * absorption ( @xmath11 ) , * fission ( @xmath12 ) , * detection ( @xmath13 ) , * removal from the fast group to the thermal ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "unlike in the terminology , used in the traditional one - group treatments , absorbtion here stands only for capture .",
    "the decay constant of the delayed neutron precursors is given as @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , both the fast and thermal neutrons can transit from one region to the others , in both directions . in all models",
    "the source is considered as releasing n particles with probability _ @xmath16 _ at an emission event . in this paper a term _ `` two - point '' _ has the same meaning as _ `` two - region''_.      for the two - group two - point model it was assumed that two adjacent infinite and homogeneous half - space regions ( denoted as a and b ) with different independent reaction intensities for absorption of fast and thermal neutrons ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , fission induced by fast and thermal neutrons ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and detection of fast and thermal neutrons ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the two regions are coupled by two passage intensities ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) in two different directions describes the intensity of particles ( group i ) leaving region a for region b and @xmath33 is the intensity of particles ( group i ) transferring to region a from region b. ] .",
    "thus , each of the reactions for the different groups of neutrons can be described by transition intensities , as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "total intensities including both the reactions and transitions between the regions for the fast and the thermal neutrons are denoted as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for regions a and b , respectively :    _ a1 = _ a1a + _ a1f +",

    "b2d    the slowing down process , i.e. the removal of neutrons from the fast group to the thermal group is described by the removal reaction intensity @xmath38 . in the two - point two - group model",
    "we also include two extraneous compound poisson sources of fast neutrons placed in different regions , a and/or b , with intensities @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the following , two special cases of the above general form will be described briefly . because in the lower dimensionality of the special cases , inclusion of delayed neutrons is possible .      in the two - group one - point feynman - alpha model ( figure [ fig:25 ] ) , we assume that the medium is infinite and homogeneous .",
    "the neutron population consists of two groups of neutrons , fast and thermal .",
    "a compound poisson source of fast neutrons with emission intensity @xmath41 is included in the model .",

    "the decay constants of delayed neutron precursors are given as @xmath52 and @xmath53 for regions a and b , as shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "thus , total transition intensities for region a and region b are denoted as @xmath54 and @xmath55 :    _ a = _ aa + _ af + _ at + _ ad    _ b = _ ba + _ bf + _ bt + _ bd    in the model we include two compound poisson sources of fast neutrons in regions a and b with emission intensities @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "for the induced fission reaction , we consider that @xmath61 neutrons and @xmath62 delayed neutron precursors are emitted with the probability distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the fission reaction in region a and region b , respectively .",
    "based on the main concept and assumptions used the two - group two - region , the two - group one - region and the two - region one - group feynman - alpha formulas are elaborated as below .      in order to derive the two - point two - group feynman - alpha theory",
