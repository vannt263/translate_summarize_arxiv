    "the thermionic electron emission from metals at high temperatures is today on the basis of countless technical applications .",

    "the stationary flow of thermionic electrons from the metal surface is currently calculated by the classical richardson - dushman ( rd ) equation .",
    "this model considers the thermal equilibrium between the electron gas and the metal lattice and makes use of the fermi - dirac distribution for the electron energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the rd thermionic electron current density @xmath1 essentially relies on the work function @xmath2 of the metal and its temperature @xmath3 , disregarding other important factors , such as the geometry @xcite of the emitting surface or its physical state @xcite .",
    "however , the electron energy distribution in metals at high temperatures frequently differs from the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the stationary rd electron emission regime represents the final step after different energy thermalization processes with shorter time scales @xcite .",
    "this time dependent decay towards the stationary thermal equilibrium have been studied by exposing the metal surfaces to ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the energy spectrum is later monitored to determine the electron energy relaxation rates @xcite .",
    "the average electron energy relaxes fast , within the femtosecond time scale by collisions between electrons .",
    "therefore , the electron @xmath4 and metal @xmath3 temperatures differ within these short times scales .",
    "the thermalization between the electron gas and the metal lattice requires of few tens of picoseconds due to the larger mass of phonons @xcite .",
    "the rd regime is considered to provide an adequate description of the electron emission for long characteristic times when the electron gas and the metal lattice reach the thermal coupling @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this pure rd thermionic emission regime of electrons has not been observed because the energy of the laser pulse lies over damage thresholds of most metals @xcite .",
    "this physical description relies on the implicit assumption of the long time scale relaxation to a thermal equilibrium where the fermi - dirac statistics describes the electron energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "this might be not always the case , even under an efficient energy transfer between the electron gas and metal lattice . for high temperatures the metal might remain out of equilibrium because additional energy exchange processes take place , such as the intense emission of electromagnetic radiation , the development strong surface thermal gradients or the nonuniform electron emission .",
    "the high energy interactions between the electrons and phonons couple the electron gas with the overheated metal lattice , producing groups of fast electrons @xcite .",

    "the rd expression underestimates the experimental emission currents for high metal temperatures , whereas @xmath1 and @xmath6 agree for moderate values .",

    "this @xmath6 accounts for the contribution of high energy electrons in the thermionic electron emission .",
