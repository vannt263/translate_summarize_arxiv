    "shock waves have been observed in a wide range of environments outside the earth , from the solar wind to the hot gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "however , the mechanism whereby the gas in these environments is shocked has been poorly understood . while shock transitions in the earth s atmosphere are mediated by molecular viscosity ( and hence direct particle collisions ) , those in interstellar space and the solar wind are too dilute to form in this way . in non - relativistic shocks , the role of collisions is effectively played by collective interactions of the plasma with the magnetic field .",
    "this results in a multi - scale shock transition having sub - structure at ion kinetic length scales ( larmor radius or inertial length ) and potentially electron kinetic scales ( inertial lengths or whistler mode ) ( e.g. , schwartz et al .",
    "( this volume ) , treumann 2009 ) .",
    "such plasmas are termed collisionless .",
    "the magnetic fields threading through the charged particle plasmas in space endow the plasmas with elastic properties , much like a fluid .",
    "the kinetic energy of the inflowing gas is dissipated within this fluid via collective interactions between the particles and magnetic field , transferring energy from the magnetic field to the particles .",
    "the collective processes are the result of the dc electromagnetic fields present in the shock transition layer , kinematic phase mixing , and also plasma instabilities ; the last give rise to a rich range of plasma waves and turbulent interactions .",
    "it has long been known that these processes may heat the electrons beyond the mass - proportional value predicted by the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions - ample evidence is found in spacecraft studies of solar wind shocks ( schwartz et al .",
    "1988 ) and multi wavelength spectroscopy of supernova remnants ( ghavamian et al .",

    "2012 ) understanding how this process depends on such shock parameters as shock speed , preshock magnetic field orientation and plasma beta has been slow .    in collisionless plasmas ,",
    "the downstream state of the plasma can not be uniquely determined from the upstream parameters because the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions only predict the _ total _ pressure downstream , not the individual contributions from the electrons and ions : @xmath2 . at the limit of a strong shock ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are each 4 times their preshock values , so the relative values of @xmath0and @xmath5immediately behind the shock are wholly dependent upon the nature of the collisionless heating processes occurring at the shock transition .",
    "although an mhd description can be used to describe the behavior of the gas far upstream and far downstream of the shock , a more detailed kinetic approach is required for understanding how the dissipation at the shock front transfers energy from plasma waves and turbulence to the electrons and ions .",
    "non - relativistic collisionless shocks can be broadly sorted into three categories : slow , intermediate and fast .",
    "the three types are defined according to the angle between the shock velocity and upstream magnetic field , as well as the relative value of the shock speed compared to the upstream sound speed ( @xmath6 ) and alfvn speed ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "most astrophysical shocks are quasi - perpendicular ( i.e. , they propagate at a nearly right angle to the preshock magnetic field ) , allowing only for fast - mode propagation . in that case , the relevant quantity is the magnetosonic mach number , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "collisionless shocks have also been classified according to whether the flow speed exceeds the sound speed in the downstream plasma ( kennel 1985 ) . above the critical mach number where the flow is subsonic , the dissipation of flow energy into thermal energy",
    "can no longer be maintained by electrical resistivity , and plasma wave turbulence ( the cause of which are instabilities generated when the electron and ion distribution functions are distorted at the shock transition ) is required ( kennel 1985 ) .",
    "shocks above the critical mach number are termed supercritical , while those below are termed subcritical .",
    "note that even for subcritical shocks , observations suggests that kinetic processes other than resistivity and turbulence contribute to the shock dissipation ( greenstadt and mellott 1987).there are also other , higher critical mach numbers related to the formation of subshocks ( kennel et al .",
    "1985 ) and non - steady cyclic shock reformation beyond the whistler critical mach number ( krasnoselskikh et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the critical mach number for quasi - perpendicular shocks is estimated to be rather low @xmath102.8 ( edmiston and kennel 1984 ) .",
    "the mach numbers of most snr shocks are expected to be well in excess of this value , meaning that they are both fast - mode and supercritical .    as one approaches the high mach numbers expected for astrophysical shocks ( @xmath1120 - 100 for an ambient magnetic field of 3 @xmath12 ) , a greater and greater fraction of the incoming ions become reflected back upstream from the shock front , corresponding to an increasingly turbulent and and disordered shock transition .",
    "physical parameters such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 no longer jump in an ordered manner ( i.e. , the transitions are no longer laminar ) .",
    "in addition to the reflected particles , the hot ions from downstream become hot enough to escape upstream , further enhancing the population of ions in front of the shock .",
    "these ions , which form a precursor , are now believed to play an essential role in the dissipation of high mach number collisionless shocks . aside from providing the seed population for the acceleration of cosmic rays , the precursor ions are likely generate a variety of plasma waves capable of selectively heating the electrons over the ions , thereby providing an important mechanism for raising @xmath16 above the mass - proportional value of @xmath17 .",
    "taken at face value , the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions predict that electrons and ions will be heated in proportion to their masses :    @xmath18    in collisionless shocks , there are three relevant timescales to consider : the time required for coulomb collisions to isotropize a distribution of electrons , @xmath19 , the time required for coulomb collisions to isotropize distribution of ions , @xmath20 , and finally the time required for the electrons and ions to equilibrate to a common temperature , @xmath21 ( spitzer 1962 ) . after a time scale @xmath19 or @xmath20 , the particles in question attain a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the self - collision time , @xmath22 for electrons of density @xmath3 and temperature @xmath0 is ( spitzer 1962 ) :    @xmath23    where ln@xmath24 is the coulomb logarithm , equation [ massprop ] has been used to write the relaxation time in terms of the shock speed and @xmath25 is the shock speed in units of 1000 kms@xmath26 . for a young snr having @xmath271000 kms@xmath26 , postshock density n@xmath281 @xmath29 and ln @xmath3030",
    "the time required to establish a maxwellian distribution at the electron temperature given by equation 1 is @xmath31 0.004 yrs .",
    "the electrons are isotropized by self - collisions first , then the protons , and finally over a longer timescale the electrons and protons equilibrate to a common temperature .",
    "for this reason , coulomb collisions alone are unable to establish equilibration electron and proton distributions at the shock front .",
    "this equilibration is described by the relation    @xmath32    where @xmath33    the temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath5 equilibrate to a common density - weighted average temperature @xmath34 , given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mean mass per particle ( @xmath37 for cosmic abundances ) . for mass - proportional heating ,",
    "the timescale given by equation [ tep ] is @xmath382000 yrs for @xmath39 @xmath401000 kms@xmath26 , of similar order but longer than the proton - proton isotropization timescale , @xmath41 .",
    "these are longer than the age of the snr , substantially so at higher @xmath39 indicating that for minimal heating ( i.e. , @xmath16@xmath421/1836 ) the electrons and ions will not equilibrate to @xmath34 during the lifetime of the snr ( itoh 1978 ; draine & mckee 1993 ) .    the arguments above indicate that coulomb collisions are ineffective at both isotropizing the heavy ion particle distributions and equilibrating the electron and ion temperatures at the transtions of collisionless shocks .",
    "the emission spectra of non - radiative snrs ( dominated mostly by x - ray and ultraviolet emission ) should therefore be sensitive probes of the collisionless heating processes at the shock transition .",
    "we consider the observational constraints of these processes below .",
    "the most useful shocks for studying collisionless equilibration processes are those exhibiting detectable emission from the immediate postshock gas . to be diagnostically useful",
    ", the emission should arise from the region close to the shock front , where temperature disequilibrium between electrons , protons and heavy ions is substantial enough to affect both the relatives fluxes and relative velocity widths of emission lines .",
    "the shape and extent of the spatial profile for the different emission species behind the shock is also a useful diagnostic , especially for the uv resonance lines of he  ii @xmath431640 , c  iv @xmath441548 , 1550 , n  v @xmath441238,1243 , and o  vi @xmath431032 , 1038 . for a given shock speed , the distance behind the shock where the emission peaks depends strongly on the initial electron temperature , and electron temperature immediately behind the shock .",
    "the ubiquity of non - radiative snrs , as well as their relatively simple geometry and very high shock speeds , makes these objects the most important laboratories for investigating the efficiency and nature of electron - ion and ion - ion equilibration .",
    "other non - radiative shocks available for study are those occurring in stellar wind bubbles ( for example , wolf - rayet bubbles ) ( gosset et al .",
    "2011 ) and in galaxy cluster shocks ( e.g. , the bullet cluster ( markevitch et al . 2005 ) and abell 2146 ( russell et al .",
    "however , these shocks are far less frequently observed than those in snrs , leaving the latter as the most important objects providing both a broad range of shock speeds and corresponding diagnostic information ( such as proper motions and spatially resolved structure ) .",
    "shocks in star forming regions , such as hh objects and their associated bow shocks , tend to be clumpy and complicated , and are usually located in dense environments ( @xmath45100 - 1000 @xmath29 ) with low enough shock speeds ( @xmath39@xmath46100 - 200 kms@xmath26 ) to be radiative . in those cases ,",
    "the optical and uv emission ( where the most valuable shock diagnostic line emission arises ) is dominated by emission from the cooling and recombination zones far downstream from the shock . in those regions",
    "the cooling of the gas below 100,000k and the accompanying compression of the gas result in a collisional plasma with @xmath47 .",
    "this erases any memory of the initial electron - ion equilibration .",
    "furthermore , a significant fraction of the ly @xmath48 continuum produced in the recomination zone is expected to pass upstream and ionize the preshock gas . in strong shocks",
    "( @xmath39@xmath4980 kms@xmath26 ) , this results in complete ionization of hydrogen ( shull & mckee 1979 ; cox & raymond 1985 ; dopita et al .",
    "1993 ) , thus precluding the use of collisionally excited balmer line emission from neutral h ( described in the next section ) as a temperature equilibration diagnostic .      in the late 1970s",
    "it was discovered that very fast ( @xmath102000 kms@xmath26 ) shocks in young snrs could generate detectable optical emission very close to the shock transition ( chevalier & raymond 1978 ; chevalier , kirshner & raymond 1980 ) , providing a valuable diagnostic of physical conditions at the shock before coulomb collisions or cooling could alter them .",
    "this emission is produced by collisional excitation of h  i as it flows into the shock front .",
    "the cold neutral component does not interact directly with the plasma waves and turbulence at the shock , while the ionized component is strongly heated and compressed by a factor of four ( when the shock is strong ) .",
    "some of the cold h is destroyed by collisional ionization ; however , the rest of the cold h undergoes charge exchange with hot ions behind the shock , generating a separate population of hot h. approximately 1 in every 5 collisions results in collisional excitation to the n=3 level of h , producing h@xmath48 and ly @xmath52 emission .",
    "the h@xmath48 line from the cold neutrals is narrow and reflects the preshock temperature ( @xmath5330,000  k ) , while that from the hot neutrals is broad ( typically @xmath54500 kms@xmath26 ) , and reflects the postchock temperature ( and to a large extent , the velocity distribution ) of the protons ( chevalier & raymond 1978 ; chevalier , kirshner & raymond 1980 ; smith et al .",
    "1991 ; ghavamian et al .",
    "2001 ) ( figure [ fig : balmerprofile ] ) . in balmer - dominated shocks , the broad to narrow h@xmath48 flux ratio is proportional to the ratio of the charge exchange rate to the ionization rate , with the latter being highly sensitive to the electron and proton temperatures .",
    "this makes the broad to narrow ratio , @xmath55 , very sensitive to @xmath16 .",
    "there is only weak dependence of @xmath55 on the preshock h  i fraction and preshock temperature , mainly due to differences in the amount of ly @xmath52 converted into h@xmath48 in the narrow component ( ghavamian et al . 2001 ; van adelsberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "-0.2 in    the first systematic attempt to use balmer - dominated snrs to infer @xmath16 for collisionless shocks was attempted by ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . using the broad h@xmath48 line widths",
    "measured from a sample of balmer - dominated shocks , they constrained the range of plausible shock speeds between the limits of minimal equilibration and full equilibration .",
    "they then predicted the broad - to - narrow ratios for a grid of shock models over this range of @xmath39 and @xmath16 , allowing @xmath16 to be constrained .",
    "the range of broad component h@xmath48 widths observed in snrs ranges from @xmath10250 kms@xmath26 for the slowest balmer - dominated shocks ( cgynus loop ) , to @xmath10 500 kms@xmath26 for intermediate - velocity shocks ( rcw 86 ) and finally @xmath102600 kms@xmath26 for the fastest shocks ( snr 0509@xmath5667.5 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a well - sampled range of shock speeds : nearly a factor of 10 . the primary uncertainty in measurement of the broad component width at low shock speeds ( @xmath57200 kms@xmath26 , as seen in the northeastern cygnus loop ; hester et al .",
    "1994 ) is disentangling the broad and narrow components when they are of comparable width . at high shock speeds ( @xmath582000 kms@xmath26 )",
    "the main difficulty is the baseline uncertainty of the surrounding continuum : if the peak of the broad line is low and the width very large , errors in ascertaining where the broad line merges into the background can lead to underestimates of the broad component width .",
    "the range of @xmath55 for this sample of balmer - dominated shocks lies between 0.4 and 1.2 ( kirshner , winkler & chevalier 1987 ; smith et al .",
    "1991 ; ghavamian et al . 2001 ; 2003 , rakowski , ghavamian & laming 2009 ) .",
    "however , it does not not vary with broad component width in a monotonic fashion .",
    "recently there has been substantial improvement in the modeling of balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "earlier calculations of the broad h@xmath48 line profile assumed that it formed from a single charge exchange ( chevalier , kirshner & raymond 1980 ; smith et al .",
    "1991 ; ghavamian et al .",
    "2001 ) , and it treated the hot and cold neutrals as two separate , distinct populations , with a given neutral belonging to either one or the other .",
    "however , in reality an interaction tree is required to track the number of photons emitted by each neutral over multiple excitations and charge exchanges .",
    "these effects were first incorporated in the balmer - dominated shock models of heng & mccray ( 2007 ) , who also found that charge exchange results in a third population of neutrals having velocity widths intermediate between the hot and cold neutrals .",
    "further improvements in modeling of balmer - dominated shocks were included by van adelsberg et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who included the momentum transferred by charge exchange between the hot neutrals and protons .",
    "this allowed the bulk velocity of the postshock neutrals to be calculated separately from those of the protons .",
    "inclusion of the momentum transfer showed that for shock speeds @xmath571000 kms@xmath26 , charge exchange effectively couples the fast neutral and thermal proton distributions , while for high shock speeds ( @xmath585000 kms@xmath26 ) , it does so far less effectively .",
    "this results in a fast neutral distribution that is skewed relative to the protons in velocity space and an average velocity that is much higher for the fast neutrals than the protons ( van adelsberg et al .",
    "together , the inclusion of all these effects has enhanced the ability of the models to match the observed broad - to - narrow ratios ( and hence predict @xmath16 ) .",
    "in particular , the newer models can now match the low broad - to - narrow ratio ( @xmath55@xmath590.67 ) observed in knot g of tycho s snr , yielding @xmath16@xmath590.05 , @xmath39@xmath591600 kms@xmath26 .",
    "however , even after all the additional physics is included , the balmer - dominated shock models are still unable to reach the low broad - to - narrow ratios measured along the rims of dem l71 ( @xmath55@xmath590.2 - 0.7 ; ghavamian et al .",
    "2003 ; rakowski , ghavamian & laming 2009 ) .",

    "chandra _ observations ( rakowski , ghavamian & hughes 2003 ) .",
    "the most promising explanation advanced for the @xmath55 discrepancy has been added narrow component flux from the shock precursor ( raymond et al . 2011 ; morlino et al .",

    "these developments are described in more detail in the next section .",
    "the plot of @xmath16 versus @xmath39for the available sample of balmer - dominated shocks shows a declining trend of equilibration with shock speed ( ghavamian et al . 2007 ; heng et al .",
    "2007 ; van adelsberg et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the trend is described by ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as full equilibration for shock speeds up to and including 400 kms@xmath26 , and a declining equilibration proportional to the inverse square of the shock speed above 400 kms@xmath26 .",
    "this description can be characterized in the following way : @xmath60 where the functional form of the the @xmath16 relation is designed to asymptotically transition to @xmath16=@xmath17 at very high shock velocities .",

    "( 2008 ) , is shown in figure  [ fig : plotequil ] ( note that the shock models used in producing these plots do not include contribution from the shock precursor ) .",
    "although the inverse correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath39was largely confirmed by van adelsberg et al ( 2008 ) , there may be some evidence of departure from the @xmath16@xmath50 @xmath61 relation at shock speeds exceeding 2000 kms@xmath26 .",
    "van adelsberg et al .",
    "find that when all three measured broad component widths and broad - to - narrow ratios from sn 1006 are included in the plot ( @xmath39@xmath102200 - 2500 kms@xmath26 ) , a slight upturn in the @xmath16-@xmath39 relation appears . the @xmath16 ratios for those cases",
    "are found to be @xmath100.03 , superficially similar to @xmath62 , rather than @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is not clear , nor whether this indicates a breakdown in the @xmath61 dependence at shock speeds exceeding 2000 kms@xmath26 . some caveats to consider when interpreting the upturn in @xmath16 seen in figure [ fig : plotequil ] are as follows : for shock speeds @xmath582000 kms@xmath26 collisional ionization and excitation of h are primarily caused by proton ( and to a lesser degree , alpha particle ) impact ( laming et al . 1996 ; ghavamian 1999 ; ghavamian et al . 2001 ; tseliakhovich et al .",
    "experimentally measured cross sections for these interactions have still not been available to high precision ( uncertainties @xmath1020%-30% still exist ) , although more sophisticated theoretical calculations are now becoming available ( see , for example , tseliakhovich et al .",
    "in addition , as the broad component width increases , the h@xmath48 profiles are spread out over an increasing number of pixels , resulting in noisier spectra and greater measurement uncertainty in the broad component width . these larger error bars in turn result in a larger uncertainty in @xmath39 , especially at shock speeds of 2000 kms@xmath26 and higher .",
    "the best way to further constrain the equilibration - shock speed relation is to add new data points to the curve shown in figure  [ fig : plotequil ] . to this end",
    ", we present balmer - dominated h@xmath48 profiles for two additional positions in tycho s snr ( different from those of knot g presented by kirshner , winkler & chevalier ( 1987 ) , smith et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "these profiles , shown in figure  [ fig : tychocennwspec ] , were acquired with a moderate resolution spectrograph in 1998 ( for details on the observational setup , see ghavamian 1999 and ghavamian et al .",
    "the profile marked ne was obtained from a clump of h@xmath48 emission located along the northeastern edge of tycho s snr , approximately 1@xmath64 northward of knot g. the clump appears behind the main body of the balmer filaments and exhibits a broad component that is substantially doppler shifted to the red ( 10.7@xmath651.2  , or about 490 kms@xmath26 ) .",
    "the doppler shift reflects the bulk velocity of the hot posthock proton distribution , so the significant velocity shift of the broad component centroid indicates that the shock in the ne has a substantial velocity component into the plane of the sky , i.e. , that the ne shock is located on the far side of the blast wave shell .",
    "the broad h@xmath48 width of the ne shock is 1300@xmath6565 kms@xmath26 ( the smallest broad component width measured in tycho s snr so far ) , with @xmath55=0.85@xmath650.04 .",
    "the nw shock , on the other hand , has a broad h@xmath48 width of 2040@xmath6555 kms@xmath26 ( the largest broad component width measured in this snr so far ) , with @xmath55=0.45@xmath650.15 .",
    "neither of these broad - to - narrow ratios is strictly reproduced by the latest models of van adelsberg et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , with the lowest predicted ratios being for case b ( the assumption of optically thick conditions for ly @xmath52 photons in the narrow component ) and for low equilibrations ( @xmath16@xmath570.1 ) . for these low equilibrations , the corresponding shock speeds for the ne and nw shocks in tycho are approximately 1400 kms@xmath26 and 2250 kms@xmath26 ( using figures 5 and 10 of van adelsberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : plotequil ] we have added data from the ne and nw shocks in tycho s snr to the @xmath16-@xmath39 plot .",
    "the two data points help fill in a portion of the plot where the data are sparse : the region between approximately 1200 kms@xmath26 and 1500 kms@xmath26 , as well as the region beyond 2000 kms@xmath26 , where the existing data are taken entirely from sn 1006 .",
    "the added point near 1400 kms@xmath26 is fully consistent with the @xmath61 relation , while @xmath16 is not well constrained enough for the point at 2250 kms@xmath26 to contradict the appearance of an upturn at the highest shock velocities .",
    "it is clear that proper characterization of the equilibration - shock velocity curve above 2000 kms@xmath26 will require both higher signal - to - noise spectra on existing balmer - dominated shocks , as well as new data points beyond a broad component width of 2500 kms@xmath26 .",
    "although the inverse squared relation between equilibration and shock velocity appears has been the most salient result of the study of balmer - dominated shocks , there have been discrepant results reported in a small subset of cases . recently the broad h@xmath48 component in the lmc snr 0509@xmath5667.5 was detected for the first time ( helder , kosenko & vink 2010 ) .",
    "broad emission was observed along both the northeastern rim ( fwhm 3900@xmath65800 kms@xmath26 ) and southwestern rim ( fwhm 2680@xmath6570 kms@xmath26 ) , with the former being the fastest balmer - dominated shock detected to date having the characteristic broad and narrow component h@xmath48 emission .",
    "interestingly , the broad - to - narrow ratios for both shocks are exceptionally low , @xmath55=0.08@xmath650.02 and 0.29@xmath650.01 along the ne and sw rims , respectively .",
    "as noted by helder , kosenko & vink ( 2010 ) these ratios are nearly twice as large as the smallest ones predicted by the models of van adelsberg et al .",

    "helder , kosenko & vink ( 2010 ) suggest that this indicates some thermal energy loss ( @xmath1020% ) to cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "this picture is supported by the presence of nonthermal x - ray emission in their fitted rgs spectra of snr 0509@xmath5667.5 .",
    "the result described above relies upon an accurate disentangling of the bulk doppler broadening from the thermal doppler broadening in the x - ray lines .",
    "the disentangling depends on parameters such as the ratio of reverse shock to forward shock velocities , as well as the ratio of the gradients in the reverse and forward shock velocities , which in turn had to be assumed from evolutionary snr models .",
    "the result , while intriguing , is still significantly uncertain . on the other hand , helder , kosenko & vink ( 2010 ) found that the x - ray shock velocities from the ne could only be reconciled with the observed broad h@xmath48 width there if @xmath16@xmath660.2 , which clearly which predicts @xmath16@xmath67 predicted from equation  [ tetpeq ] .",
    "if this result were to be confimed by future observations , it would present a new challenge in understanding how electron - ion equilibration occurs in fast collisionless shocks .",
    "one possibility , given the presence of nonthermal x - ray emission in the spectra of 0509@xmath5667.5 ( warren & hughes 2004 ; helder , kosenko & vink 2010 ) is that the moderate loss of thermal energy to cosmic ray acceleration may have slightly increased the compression and reduced the temperature at the shock front compared to the case with no acceleration ( decourchelle , ellison & ballet 2000 ; ellison et al . 2007 ) .",
    "both of these effects would tend to render the plasma more collisional , possibly explaining the @xmath16@xmath660.2 result .",
    "however , it is also worth noting that the shock velocity used for obtaining @xmath16 in the ne is subject to the same model dependence and uncertainties as the sw measurements , so similar caution is required in its interpretation .",

    "2007 , described in the next section ) . furthermore , as pointed out by drury et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the ion - neutral damping of alfvn waves in the precursor is unimportant for cosmic rays which have already exceeded @xmath90 . since the acceleration time for cosmic rays shortens considerably with shock speed ( @xmath104 ; malkov & drury 2001 ) , the fastest balmer - dominated shocks are more likely to have accelerated particles beyond @xmath90 and hence will begin to exhibit nonthermal x - ray emission and cosmic - ray modified shock structure .",
    "a good example is the aforementioned snr 0509@xmath5667.5 , where the shock speeds exceed 5000 kms@xmath26 ( helder , kosenko & vink 2010 ) and nonthermal x - ray emission from cosmic ray accelerated electrons is detected from the forward shock .",
    "the forward shocks in more evolved balmer - dominated snrs ( such as sn 1006 and tycho s snr ) will have swept up more mass and slowed down to speeds @xmath572000 kms@xmath26 , by which point @xmath105 will have lengthened and the shocks will be less cosmic - ray dominated .",

    "these shocks are in a different area of parameter space than the snr shocks discussed here , and the physics governing the electron heating in relativistic shocks is substantially different . at the very high alfvnic mach numbers characteristic of gamma - ray bursts , the shock transition becomes very thin ( less than an electron gyroradius ) .",
    "electrons in this case may be once again accelerated by the cross shock potential , similar to the very low mach number case . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of other studies consider non - relativistic shocks relevant to snrs ( @xmath570.01c ) , where accelerated particles such as cosmic rays or solar energetic particles ( seps ) may play an important role in establishing their shock structure .",
    "these studies have sought to identify plasma waves capable of boosting electrons to mildly relativistic energies ( e.g. , amano & hoshino 2010 ; riquelme & spitkovsky 2011 ) , with the objective of understanding how electrons are injected into the cosmic ray acceleration process .",
    "this is a different ( though related ) question from what we consider here , namely how electrons are promptly heated to temperatures @xmath105@xmath9310@xmath70  k at the shock front ( ghavamian et al . 2007 ; rakowski et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this limits our consideration of the work done so far to two broad scenarios of electron heating in fast , non - relativistic collisionless shocks .",
    "one scenario is based on lower hybrid wave heating in the cosmic ray precursor ( laming 2000 ; ghavamian et al .",
    "2007 ; rakowski et al . 2008 ) while the other is based on counterstreaming instabilities ahead of the shock ( e.g. , the buneman instability , cargill & papadapoulos ( 1988 ) , matsukiyo 2010 ; dieckmann et al .",
    "we discuss these mechanisms below in turn .",
    "the most significant result of the balmer - dominated shock studies , the inverse squared relation between @xmath16 and @xmath39 , places a useful constraint on the range of plausible equilibration mechanisms at the shock front .",
    "the simplest way to obtain @xmath16@xmath106 is to set @xmath107 at shock speeds of 400 kms@xmath26 and higher , while allowing @xmath1 to rise according to the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions , @xmath108 .",

    "the time dependence and non - locality introduced reduces the degree of electron heating .",
    "however at sufficiently alfvn mach number ( where the shock transition becomes thin ( on the order of the electron convective gyroradius or inertial length ) , significant electron heating may again occur . in the absence of magnetic field amplification by cosmic rays , this might be expected to happen at snr shocks .",
    "however it is much more likely in environments where the plasma beta is low , such as galaxy clusters .",
    "it may also occur in cases where a significant population of cosmic rays is unlikely due to the low age of the shock , as in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "from the beginning , a detailed study of the fastest collisionless shocks has been hampered by one inherent limitation : they occur in objects which are too remote for in situ study .",
    "although some collisionless shocks in our solar system reach alfvnic mach numbers as high as 30 ( such as those around saturn ; achilleos et al .",
    "2006 ; masters et al .",

    "in addition , the range of plasma betas attainable in the solar system is larger than the range of plasma betas attained in the interstellar medium .",
    "another fundamental difference between solar wind and snr shocks is the fact that the former are short - lived phenomena confined to small spatial scales ( millions of km ) in a curved ( bow shock ) geometry , whereas the latter are sustained for thousands of years , on spatial scales of parsecs , often well - described by a planar geometry .",
    "this results in an irreducible difference between the two types of shocks : particles crossing back and forth between upstream and downstream can remain in contact with snr shocks for long periods of time , allowing accelerated crs to acquire much more energy in snr shocks than in solar wind shocks .",

    "furthermore , given the low mach numbers found in the galaxy clusters , it is plausible that the shock transitions in these cases are laminar ( as opposed to turbulent like the snr and fastest solar wind shocks ) , with electron heating occurring efficiently at the shock front via the same type of cross - shock potential as seen in the slowest solar wind and slowest snr ( @xmath39@xmath53 400 kms@xmath26 ) shocks .",
    "this is of course a speculation ; further insight into collisionless cluster shocks may be obtained via numerical simulations for the appropriate conditions .",
    "there have been exciting advances in the study of electron - ion temperature equilibration in collisionless shocks during the past few years .",
    "perhaps most notable has been the growing realization that temperature equilibration and cosmic ray acceleration may be intertwined processes .",
    "optical studies of collisionless shocks in partially neutral gas ( balmer - dominated shocks ) have shown that the electron - ion temperature equilibration is a declining function of shock speed , well characterized as @xmath16@xmath184 .",
    "this relationship most likely arises due to electron heating ahead of the shock that is nearly independent of shock speed above 400 kms@xmath26 .",
    "cosmic ray precursors , with moderately amplified preshock magnetic field and density , are the most logical sites for electron heating in snr collisionless shocks .",
    "the transition to fully equilibrated snr shocks at speeds below 400 kms@xmath26 may be due to a less turbulent and more laminar structure at low shock speeds and mach numbers .",
    "this allows the electrons to experience a more uniform cross - shock potential , and hence higher energization compared to higher shock speeds and mach numbers , where the shock jump is more turbulent and disordered .",
    "the magnetosonic mach numbers of snr shocks may match those in solar wind shocks if there is a approximately an order of magnitude increase in the alfvn speed of the preshock gas in snrs compared to the average ism value .",
    "this is possible if there is a moderately amplified preshock magnetic field ( @xmath1010 ) , and is readily provided by compression and heating in a cosmic ray precursor . in solar wind shocks , the precursor is due to suprathermal , non - relativistic ions , resulting in a @xmath16@xmath185 seen in the solar wind .",
    "while balmer - dominated shocks have allowed us to elucidate some of the physics of electron - ion temperature equilibration , ion - neutral damping limits most of those observed to cases where the shock structure has not become strongly modified by cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "given this limitation , _ electron - ion equilibration studies of fast , collisionless shocks in fully pre - ionized gas would be highly desirable_. such a sample would allow the equilibration to be studied over a range of speeds where shocks are increasingly affected by feedback from the accelerated cosmic rays .",
    "in such circumstances it is unclear what would happen to the @xmath16 versus @xmath39  relation .",
    "if , as predicted by amato & blasi ( 2009 ) , bell s non - resonant cosmic ray instability takes over from the resonant instability at the highest shock speeds , then additional electron heating may occur in the fastest shocks ( @xmath39@xmath585000 kms@xmath26 ) , resulting in substantial deviation from the @xmath16@xmath184 relation .",
    "such deviations may already have been seen in the fastest ( @xmath39@xmath582000 kms@xmath26 ) shocks , where there is evidence that @xmath16 does not settle down to @xmath17 , but rather @xmath100.03 .",
    "other deviations may have been detected in snr 0509@xmath5667.5 , where @xmath16 for a 5000 kms@xmath26 shock has been estimated to be @xmath100.2 , substantially higher than predicted by the inverse squared relation .",
    "however , the study of such shocks would be challenging . without an h@xmath48 broad component to constrain the range of @xmath39",
    ", shock speeds would have to be determined by other means , such as proper motion studies . that would require x - ray and or uv imagery of snrs with well - constrained distances ( such as those in the lmc or smc ) , over multiple epochs .",
    "it would also require spectroscopy of the forward shocks in these snrs , in order to constrain both the electron temperature ( via x - ray continuum fits and and uv emission line ratios ) and the ion temperature ( e.g. , via he  ii , c  iv , n  v and o  vi resonance lines ) .    an important test of our ideas concerning electron heating by cosmic ray generated waves in a shock precursor would be to measure electron temperatures at snr shocks exhibiting strong cosmic ray modification and substantial magnetic field amplification ( @xmath186100 ) . several snrs show x - ray filaments produced by synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray electrons , and are generally distinct from those shocks with strong balmer emission .",
    "the absence of neutral material ahead of these shock means that optical and uv emission is weak , and electron temperatures will have to be measured from x - ray spectra .",
    "difficulties arise in distinguishing thermal electron bremsstrahlung from cosmic ray electron synchrotron emission , requiring data of high signal to noise .",
    "further complications in some snrs ( e.g. cas a ) stem from scattering of bright x - ray emission from the ejecta such that it coincides spatially with emission from the forward shock .",
    "such scattering may either be local , due to snr dust , or instrumental , due to telescope imperfections .",
    "this leaves sn 1006 as the best likely target for such an observation , since due to its evolutionary state , only the outer layers of ejecta have encountered the reverse shock .",
    "the development of missions like solar orbiter and solar probe plus will allow _ in situ _ measurements of shocks in the solar wind , most likely associated with coronal mass ejections , much closer to the sun .",
    "these will probe a different parameter regime , where the magnetic field pressure dominates over the gas pressure ( low @xmath52 , similar to ism shocks ) .",
    "as such , measurements here might yield insights into the properties of similar plasma in the precursors of snr shocks where the magnetic field has been amplified by cosmic rays .",
