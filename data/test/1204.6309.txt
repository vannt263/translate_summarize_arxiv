    "chiral symmetry is believed to be a fundamental symmetry of qcd . however , this symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures and chemical potentials by a finite expectation value of the quark ( or chiral ) condensate , @xmath2 per light quark flavor in vacuum . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the symmetry is expected to be restored as the value of the condensate approaches zero .",
    "such behavior has been observed in lattice - qcd computations  @xcite , but it remains a long - standing goal to observe chiral restoration in experiment .",
    "this is difficult because a direct measurement of the chiral condensate is not possible .",
    "one way to indirectly infer the chiral condensate and deduce chiral symmetry restoration is through the use of sum rules .",
    "they are formulated to relate hadronic spectral functions to properties of the ground state ( condensates ) including chiral order parameters .",
    "the observation of in - medium changes of hadronic spectral functions can then signal pertinent changes in these order parameters . of particular interest are spectral functions of so - called chiral partners , _",
    "i.e. _ , hadronic states which are degenerate at chiral restoration , but are split in vacuum due to dynamical chiral breaking .",
    "the prime example are the iso - vector vector and axial - vector channels which are connected through weinberg - type sum rules  @xcite ( see , _",
    "e.g , _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study of chiral partners in the open - charm sector ) .",
    "therefore an accurate measurement of both the vector and axial - vector spectral functions can be used to infer chiral order parameters and thus  observe \" chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "additional information can be gleaned from the spectral functions by considering qcd sum rules  @xcite which are dependent on both chirally symmetric and chirally breaking ground - state properties .",
    "a lot has been learned about the in - medium vector spectral function from dilepton measurements and their interpretation  @xcite , but no experimental measurement of the in - medium axial - vector spectral function has been performed to date .",
    "one is thus left with constructing effective models of the axial - vector spectral function in order to study chiral symmetry restoration .    in order to reliably evaluate in - medium effects on the vector and axial - vector spectral functions",
    ", one should first control their properties in vacuum .",
    "this is aided by accurate experimental measurements of the vacuum spectral functions through @xmath3-decays by the aleph and opal collaborations  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "sum rules have been used along with experimental data to calculate the condensates  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the condensates can be used to constrain the spectral functions .",
    "weinberg s original study assumed a @xmath4-function approximation for both the low - lying vector and axial - vector resonances in his sum rules to determine the famous relation between the masses of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons , @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "similarly , qcd sum rules have been applied in the vector channel , where early works approximated the @xmath5 by a @xmath4 function while also considering medium effects  @xcite . more recent work has considered spectral functions with a breit - wigner shape for the @xmath5 peak  @xcite , and have included the axial - vector channel in their analyses  @xcite , while others analyzed calculations based upon a microscopic theory  @xcite . clearly , the focus in previous work was on qcd sum rules , with the contribution to the continuum approximated by a @xmath8-function with a threshold energy .",
    "furthermore , until the most recent studies  @xcite , the vacuum spectral functions did not take advantage of the high - precision @xmath3-decay data . the often simplified constructions of spectral functions used to analyze the sum rules , and the dearth of analyses to include the axial - vector channel or consider the weinberg - type sum rules , leaves this area open for further considerations .",
    "in the present paper , we simultaneously analyze vector and axial - vector spectral functions in vacuum using an extended model which combines a microscopic @xmath5 spectral function with breit - wigner anstze for the @xmath6 and the first excited states .",
    "this model is quantitatively constrained by both the experimental @xmath3-decays  @xcite and the weinberg - type sum rules  @xcite . by using this combination of criteria ,",
    "the model may be considered a non - trivial fit of the data .",
    "novel features of our analysis include the study of excited states and the postulate that the continuum contribution is identical for both the vector and axial - vector channels , as should be the case in the perturbative regime .",
    "in particular , the use of the weinberg - type sum rules leads us to deduce the presence of an excited axial - vector state , about which rather little is known to date  @xcite . as an additional check ,",
    "we utilize the constructed spectral functions in a pertinent analysis of qcd sum rules .",

    "sum rules are a valuable tool for understanding non - perturbative aspects of qcd as they relate two different formulations of the same correlation function to each other . for the current paper",
    ", we will focus on two classes of sum rules , weinberg - type and qcd sum rules .",
    "let us begin by defining the current - current correlators for the vector and axial - vector channels , @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pertinent currents in the quark basis .",
    "the correlators can be decomposed into 4-dimensional transverse and longitudinal parts as @xmath13 since the vector current is conserved , @xmath14 .",
    "the longitudinal component of the axial - vector is governed by the contribution from the pion which causes the axial current not to be conserved . in vacuum , the self - energy of the pion is assumed to be negligible , rendering the imaginary part of the longitudinal axial - vector polarization of the simple form @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "it is also useful to define an additional polarization function , @xmath17 ( which corresponds to @xmath18 in ref .",
    "the transverse polarization functions for both vector and axial - vector channels are used to define the spectral functions such that @xmath19 a spectral function for @xmath20 can be defined in a similar manner as @xmath21 from the definition of @xmath20 and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pipole ] ) and ( [ eq : specdef ] ) , we see that @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ , this spectral function has contributions from both the pion and the axial - vector mesons ( plus continuum , see below ) .",

    "they have the general form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is an integer , and @xmath26 are chiral order parameters dependent on the sum rule in question .",

    "( [ eq : wsr2 ] ) should both the vector and axial - vector spectral functions be known precisely .",
    "the sum rule for @xmath33 was introduced by das , mathur , and okubo @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean squared radius of the charged pion , and @xmath36 is the coupling constant for the radiative pion decay , @xmath37 .",
    "we label this sum rule as the @xmath38 one since it has a smaller value of @xmath25 as compared to weinberg s initial sum rules .",
    "lastly , kapusta and shuryak  @xcite derived a sum rule for @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the part of the four - quark condensate which breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "the explicit quark content of this operator is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denote the gell - mann matrices .",
    "it is common to assume that this operator can be factorized into the chiral condensate , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a parameter larger than one to mimic the contributions beyond ground - state saturation .",
    "typically the weinberg - type sum rules are expressed in vacuum in terms of @xmath46 as is done here .",
    "however , it is possible to include the pion pole into the axial - vector spectral function and thereby write the sum rules in terms of @xmath47 with their right - hand - side ( rhs ) appropriately adjusted .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the sum rules at finite temperature .    for studies of chiral symmetry restoration ,",
    "satisfying these sum rules is critical both in medium and in vacuum . in the present work",
    ", we will make the first step by using the first three , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wsr1 ] ) , ( [ eq : wsr2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : wsr0 ] ) , to constrain the parameters of the vacuum spectral functions .",
    "the last sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsr3 ] ) , is not used due to a large uncertainty in the value of @xmath45 and the rather high sensitivity of the integration to large @xmath48 where the control from experimental data is limited .",
    "nevertheless , we will still examine how well it is satisfied by the constructed spectral functions .",
    "the qcd sum rules , on the other hand , apply to the vector and axial - vector channels separately .",
    "they were first introduced by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov using the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite .",
    "they relate the integral over the spectral function to a series of ground - state operators ( expectation values ) specific for the channel of interest . to improve the convergence of the integral over the spectral function , one performs a borel transform on both sides of the sum rule . for the vector channel one obtains @xmath49 and for the axial - vector channel @xmath50 by performing the borel transform , one trades the space - like 4-momentum , @xmath51 , with the borel mass , @xmath52 .",
    "note that the axial - vector spectral function is defined to contain the contribution from the pion pole ( use of @xmath53 , not @xmath46 ) . to the order @xmath54 , which we are working , the following operators figure : the chiral condensate , @xmath55 , the gluon condensate , @xmath56 , and the vector and axial - vector four - quark condensates , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the four - quark condensates can be expressed in terms of their quark content as in @xcite @xmath59 @xmath60 and are related to the chirally breaking four - quark condensate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q4xb ] ) as @xmath61 these forms of the four - quark condensates and the coefficients in the sum rules are chosen such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 have a simple factorized form , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are , in principle , independent and thus could take on different values ; they are related to @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) via @xmath66 for simplicity we have chosen @xmath64 and @xmath65 as numerically identical , which then implies from eq .",

    "_ @xmath67 .",
    "a more general discussion on the properties of four - quark condensates can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that the sign of the chiral - condensate term is the same for the two sum rules , not opposite as one might expect since the chiral condensate is a chirally odd operator .",
    "the latter reasoning actually applies to the transverse part of the axial - vector current .",
    "however , the qcd sum rule written above is for the total current including the longitudinal part induced by the pion contribution .",
    "this leads to the signs presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a1qcd ] ) .",
    "we also note that the weinberg sum rules 1 - 3 can be derived from the qcd sum rules by subtracting both sides of the vector and axial - vector qcd sum rules from each other , taylor expanding the borel convergence factor @xmath68 , and equating the coefficients of equal powers of @xmath52 on each side .",
    "a similar procedure was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in ref .",
    "@xcite to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsr3 ] ) .",
    "if one knows the vector or axial - vector spectral function , the qcd sum rule can be used to determine the values of the condensates .",
    "conversely , since the condensates are universal low - energy operators , they can be calculated from other processes , and in turn be used to constrain the spectral functions .",
    "though related to the weinberg - type , qcd sum rules can provide different constraints on the spectral functions because both chirally even and chirally odd operators are involved .",
    "a recent study of the constraints on the spectral functions imposed by the chiral odd operators in the qcd sum rules can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a potential drawback of the qcd sum rules comes from the relatively large uncertainty of the values of the gluon and 4-quark condensates , as compared with the pion mass or its decay constant in the first three weinberg sum rules .",
    "therefore , we will not use the qcd sum rules to constrain the vacuum spectral functions , but rather use the constructed spectral functions to constrain the condensates and in this way perform a consistency check .    in principle , there are corrections to the qcd sum rules  @xcite . besides the conventional perturbative and power corrections , the most prominent one not included here is associated with the exchange of instantons with the vacuum .",
    "it turns out that the importance of instantons depends on the specific correlator  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , whether direct - instanton interactions are operative , like in the scalar and pseudoscalar meson channels .",
    "in both the vector and axial - vector channels these are absent and the remaining corrections are probably small  @xcite .",
    "we therefore believe that the qcd sum rules considered here are sufficiently accurate .",
    "so far , we have discussed weinberg - type and qcd sum rules and their usefulness in constructing vacuum spectral functions . in this section ,",
    "we present a model which we will use to construct the spectral functions suitable for a physically motivated fit to @xmath3-decay data . note that for the purpose of the present work the concrete fit functions and parameter values are not important as long as the data are accurately reproduced .",
    "our main ansatz , which is one of the differences of our work from previous analyses , is that the vector and axial - vector spectral functions are divided up into three parts : the ground - state resonance , a first excited state , and a universal continuum , @xmath69 the explicit form of each part will be discussed in turn .",
    "the ground - state resonance in the vector channel , the @xmath70 , has been well - studied in effective hadronic lagrangians ; we here employ the spectral function of ref .",
    "@xcite which was originally fit to the pion electromagnetic form - factor and @xmath71-wave @xmath72 scattering phase shifts , but also turns out to describe the experimental @xmath3-decay data well  @xcite ; its medium modifications have been widely applied to experiment , _",
    "e.g. _ , in dilepton and photon production in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite and in elementary reactions  @xcite .",
    "these features make the @xmath5 spectral function a suitable starting point ( both in vacuum and for future studies in medium ) for the other two components which will largely rely on fits to the @xmath3-decay data .",
    "the spectral properties of the @xmath6 meson are much less studied , especially in the medium . since our eventual objective",
    "are studies of the spectral function s medium modifications ( and the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration for the vector and axial - vector ) , we adopt a more schematic ansatz for the @xmath6 spectral function . rather than using the vacuum spectral function from an effective hadronic model ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we employ a generic breit - wigner form , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the bare mass , @xmath75 the axial - vector coupling constant , and @xmath76 the energy dependent width of the resonance .",
    "these parameters will be determined uniquely for the @xmath6 .",
    "the form of the coefficient @xmath77 is the same as in vector - meson dominance .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath6 width will be approximated by an @xmath78-wave decay into @xmath79 . in order to properly incorporate the three - pion final state , the spectral shape of the @xmath5",
    "will be accounted for by integrating over its spectral function .",
    "finally , to simulate the finite size of the @xmath80 vertex and to control the large energy behavior of the @xmath6 spectral function , a hadronic form - factor is included .",
    "putting all of this together , the energy dependent width of the @xmath6 takes the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath5 propagator , and the center of mass momentum of the @xmath5 and @xmath83 decay products , @xmath84 , is given by @xmath85 this ansatz involves two additional parameters , a form - factor cut - off , @xmath86 , and the @xmath87 coupling constant which determines the magnitude of the on - shell width , @xmath88 , defined as @xmath89 .",
    "the first excited resonances in both vector and axial - vector channels , namely the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are included in the current construction .",
    "their contribution to the spectral functions is presented here while the motivation will be provided later .",
    "again , we note that not only is this the first attempt to include them in such a study , but given the well established @xmath0 contribution , we will be deducing the _ need _ to include the @xmath1 based upon the weinberg - type sum rules . a microscopic description of the excited resonance states is not well understood to date .",
    "therefore , as was done for the @xmath6 , the spectral functions of the excited resonances will be approximated by a breit - wigner shape as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b - w ] ) . to construct the energy - dependent width ,",
    "we are once again guided by plausible decay channels .",
    "however , unlike for the @xmath6 case , the decay products are not well established .",
    "instead we postulate that the width exhibits a threshold which is controlled by an estimated mass scale .",
    "we further postulate that the partial - wave distribution of the decay products is the same as for its corresponding ground state , namely the @xmath0 decays through a @xmath71-wave process while the @xmath1 decays through an @xmath78-wave process .",
    "furthermore , since the actual decay products of the excited resonances are not explicitly specified , treating them off - shell by folding in their spectral function is not warranted . as for the ground states , a form - factor will be included .",
    "this leads to a width of the @xmath0 as @xmath90 and for the @xmath1 as @xmath91 the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 set the bare mass for the pertinent resonances ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 correspond to the effective mass thresholds of the decay products , while @xmath96 and @xmath97 set the form - factor scales .",
    "lastly , the overall strengths of the widths are given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which again have been normalized such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "at high energies , the contribution from the continuum can be calculated from perturbative qcd .",
    "most previous work has assumed that this contribution exhibits a threshold energy below which it vanished while the perturbative value was assumed above .",
    "we have adopted a continuous function for all energies which approaches the perturbative value for large energies  @xcite , @xmath102}\\right).\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath103 plays the role of a threshold energy while @xmath4 determines how fast the limiting value is achieved .",
    "furthermore , because at high energies , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the perturbative regime , qcd is chirally invariant , we postulate an identical continuum contribution to both channels .",
    "thus the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath4 are the same for the vector and axial - vector channels and @xmath104 .",
    "this is the first time that this feature has been implemented ; besides the underlying physical motivation of degenerate perturbative continua , it will play a crucial role in interpreting the vacuum spectral functions .",
    "the total number of fit parameters of our model for the vector and axial - vector spectral functions in vacuum is 16 ( the three from the @xmath5 spectral function have been fixed before ) .",
    "they include the masses @xmath105 , the couplings @xmath106 , the width strengths @xmath107 , and the form - factors scales @xmath108 for each @xmath109 and @xmath1 states . the @xmath0 and @xmath1 furthermore incorporate a threshold mass scale , @xmath110 , and finally the continuum carries the two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath4 .",
    "the continuum also depends on the strong coupling constant which was chosen to be @xmath111 .",
    "this set of convenient and physically motivated parameters was determined by fitting the spectral distributions of hadronic @xmath3-decays into an even and odd number of pions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the requirement of reproducing the weinberg - type sum rules was imposed ( except the third one , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsr3 ] ) , _ cf . _  our comment above ) .",
    "the fit was not done for all 16 parameters simultaneously , but rather three sequential fits were performed .",
    "first , the parameters of the @xmath6 peak and the continuum were determined from the axial - vector aleph @xmath3-decay data .",
    "second , the @xmath112 peak parameters were determined from the vector aleph @xmath3-decay data .",
    "and lastly , the parameters associated with the @xmath1 peak were determined from the weinberg - type sum rules .",

    "a measure of the goodness of fit is the coefficient of determination , @xmath113 .",
    "the vector channel has an @xmath113 value of 0.991 while the axial - vector channel ( without the @xmath1 ) has an @xmath113 value of 0.997 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     second , the current study is the first to include excited resonance states into a construction of the spectral functions using sum rule techniques .",
    "previous works  @xcite have argued that their continuum ansatz , with a smaller threshold , was providing sufficient agreement with the data such that explicitly treating these states was not necessary .",
    "however , when the continuum is pushed to higher energies , a region in energy is created where the vector spectral function is no longer in good agreement with experiment ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig : rhospec ] for the continuum contribution undershooting the data ) . to accommodate this ,",
    "it is therefore natural to include the effects of a @xmath0 resonance .",
    "this argument , based upon _",
    "observed _ bumps in experimental data , can not be applied to the axial - vector channel , since there is no direct indication which suggests a clear need for an @xmath1 state _",
    "a priori_. however , our enforcing of the weinberg - type sum rules dictates additional strength in the axial - vector channel which is not incompatible with data .",
    "to further illustrate this point , let us switch off the @xmath1 peak .",
    "the resulting axial - vector spectral function still describes the data as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1spec2 ] , but evaluating the weinberg - type sum rules in this scenario leads to appreciable discrepancies in all cases , _ cf . _  the dot - dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : wsr ] .",
    "therefore , the requirement of satisfying the sum rules by the constructed spectral functions lets us deduce the presence of an @xmath1 state .",
    ", compared to experimental data  @xcite . ]",
    "third , one may ask if there is other evidence for an excited axial - vector state .",
    "the particle data group  @xcite lists three possible candidates , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , though none of them are very well established ( the latter two can only be found in the  further states \" list and none are included in the summary table ) .",
    "being the first excited resonance , it would be natural to associate our @xmath1 with the @xmath114 , but the mass and width do not match well .",
    "a similar problem actually holds for the excited vector resonance : while we fit the aleph data with a single @xmath0 state of mass 1565  mev , the pdg has states at @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this suggests that the bump seen in the data is an amalgamation of the two excited @xmath5 states . in principle , we could have tried to use a spectral function with two excited states , but the significance for the latter is not apparent from the single bump in the @xmath3-decay data and thus it would only serve to increase the number of our parameters without improving the fit .",
    "though we call our state @xmath0 , it may well represent the contribution from the two excited resonance states quoted by the pdg .",
    "a similar argument holds for the @xmath1 state .",
    "it is then not a problem that the properties of this proposed state do not match well with previously seen individual resonances .",
    "nevertheless , it is rather consistent with an average of the lowest two states , similar to the @xmath0 case .",
    "fourth , by adjusting the parameters of the @xmath1 states , the percent deviations of the weinberg - type sum rules can change . the percent deviation of the second weinberg - type sum rule is the most sensitive to such changes in parameters because the rhs of this sum rule is numerically very small .",
    "each sum rule responds differently to each parameter .",
    "for example , the percent deviation of wsr-3 can be decreased by shifting the @xmath1 mass to lower energies , however the percent deviation of all the other sum rules becomes worse . as an extreme case",
    ", the @xmath1 can be shifted to lower energies accompanied by the reduction of the @xmath1 coupling so that wsr-2 and wsr-3 are both ",
    "precisely \" satisfied ; wsr-0 and wsr-1 are then violated by @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "although the overall deviations are smaller in this case than with the parameters in table [ tab : para ] , we believe that is it better to get the best possible agreement with the two sum rules which are most accurately know .    finally , the other fitted parameters seem to be in reasonable agreement with expectations .",
    "the @xmath6 mass is well within the pdg range  @xcite , while its width is at the upper end of its range .",
    "the form - factor scales of around 1 gev are of typical hadronic size , with the one for the @xmath6 somewhat , though not unreasonably , smaller .",
    "the threshold scale is consistent with decays into 4@xmath83 states for the @xmath0 , while it is slightly larger than the physically expected 5@xmath83 threshold for the @xmath1 .",
    "although the coupling for the @xmath1 , @xmath121 , seems large compared to the other states , its numerical value is dependent on the location of the continuum as discussed above .",
    "overall , the chosen parameters result in spectral functions that fit the data and appear to be within reason of their physical interpretation .",
    "although the qcd sum rules were not used to initially constrain the model , it is interesting to determine to what extent the resulting spectral functions satisfy them . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhoqcd ] ) and ( [ eq : a1qcd ] ) , one can see that there are three condensates whose values are needed .",
    "the quark condensate will be set at the commonly used value , @xmath122 . however , there is appreciable variability in the values of @xmath45 and the gluon condensate in the literature .",
    "their values will be tuned to optimize the agreement of the qcd sum rules given our input spectral functions .    to quantify this agreement ,",
    "we will use the method described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this method",
    ", one first defines a lhs and a rhs corresponding to the resonance part in the dispersion integral and the ope with the continuum contribution from the dispersion integral subtracted , respectively . for our purposes",
    ", this division will be written as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhoqcd ] ) and ( [ eq : a1qcd ] ) with the continuum part of the spectral functions subtracted from both sides .",
    "second , a range in the borel mass , the so - called borel window , needs to be established where one expects the best agreement between the two sides given their applicability limitations .",
    "we will define the lower limit , @xmath123 , in the standard way , _",
    "i.e. _ , as the borel mass where the terms proportional to @xmath124 contribute at most 10% to the rhs , indicating that the ope becomes unreliable at still smaller values of the borel mass . for large borel mass ,",
    "the ope is dominated by the @xmath125 term . however",
    ", this term is nearly trivially satisfied by the continuum . therefore , in order to analyze the agreement due to the resonance states , an upper limit to the borel window is introduced .",
    "this is typically chosen as the mass where the continuum contribution equals the one from the resonances .",
    "we have found that applying this procedure with our spectral functions results in a borel window nearly double in size of what was previously found in the literature .",
    "this difference simply arises due to the significantly higher energies for the onset of our universal continuum .",
    "we therefore decided to redefine the upper limit of the window , @xmath126 , as the mass where the continuum contribution is half of the resonance contribution .",
    "this produces a borel window of similar size as in previous studies . instead of a 50/50 split between continuum and resonances at the upper range",
    ", we thus have a 67/33 proportion between resonances and continuum . with these considerations",
    ", we found a borel window of @xmath127 for the vector channel and @xmath128 for the axial - vector channel , which is comparable to earlier studies  @xcite .    with spectral functions , condensate values , and the borel window defined",
    ", the agreement between the two sides of the sum rule is measured by the value @xmath129 defined as @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "one can think of @xmath129 as the average deviation between the two sides over the borel window .",
    "the optimization of the values for @xmath45 and the gluon condensate thus amounts to minimizing @xmath129 . optimizing the vector and axial - vector channels independently yields different values of @xmath45 and the gluon condensate for the two channels . while the gluon condensate should be identical",
    ", the value of @xmath45 , representing correlations beyond the ground state , can , in principle , be different for different quantum numbers . for simplicity ,",
    "we have decided to also assume a universal @xmath45 value and to minimize the sum of the @xmath129 values obtained from the two channels , that is , we minimize @xmath132 . to estimate the uncertainty in the optimized values , the range in @xmath45 and",
    "the gluon condensate which produces a combined deviation of less than @xmath133 has been found .",
    "the minimization procedure gives @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the optimized @xmath129 values for vector and axial - vector channel are 0.24% and 0.56% , respectively . increasing the upper limit of the borel window , @xmath126 by @xmath136 yields no significant change in the values of the parameters , but increases the deviation .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath64 and @xmath65 are decoupled , the optimization procedure yields rather similar results , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 , thereby justifying _ a posteriori _ the simplifying assumption of identical @xmath45 values .",
    "our values for @xmath45 are well within the range previously found in the literature  @xcite , while the value for the gluon condensate is in the upper range .",
    "for example , early applications in charmonium sum rules have extracted @xmath142  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "more recent studies of higher moments of the charmonium sum rules yield significantly larger values , of around @xmath143  @xcite , close to our value .    to illustrate the agreement of the qcd sum rules , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : qcd ] both lhs and rhs for each channel , scaled by @xmath52 , as a function of @xmath144 over the borel window . with the sub-@xmath133 agreement , it is difficult to distinguish the two curves in each figure .",
    "we note that an increase in @xmath45 with fixed gluon condensate will shift the rhs of the vector channel down , while the rhs of the axial channel is shifted up ( dashed curves ) , thereby making the agreement in _ _ b__oth channels worse .",
    "overall , the spectral functions constructed may be considered consistent with the qcd sum rules .",
    "in the present work , we have performed a combined analysis of weinberg - type and qcd sum rules using vacuum spectral functions for vector and axial - vector channels constructed via quantitative fits to hadronic @xmath3-decay data . for the ground - state resonances , we employed a microscopic @xmath5 spectral function and a breit - wigner ansatz for the @xmath6 .",
    "a novel feature of our approach is the introduction of an excited state in each channel which , in turn , allowed us to employ an universal perturbative continuum part at high energies .",
    "the universality of the continua is rather welcome in view of chiral degeneracy in perturbation theory , and leads to a higher onset energy than in previous works .",
    "while the excited vector state ( @xmath0 ) was deduced from an accurate fit to data , we have found that the three lowest weinberg - type sum rules can be quantitatively satisfied only if the existence of an @xmath1 state is postulated .",
    "the latter lies outside the direct realm of the axial - vector @xmath3-decay data , but the extracted mass is compatible with ( and in a sense confirms ) an average of previously observed states .",
    "furthermore , the resulting spectral functions were implemented into qcd sum rules , resulting in a sub-@xmath133 agreement with the operator product expansion ( comparable to other state - of - the - art analyses ) .",
    "we believe that these spectral functions provide a good basis for future studies of medium modifications , to shed light on the long - standing problem of testing chiral symmetry restoration with dilepton data .",
