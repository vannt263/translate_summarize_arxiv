    "the modification of the free space properties of a vector meson in hadronic or nuclear matter is an important problem which has attracted much attention . among the properties of immediate interest are the mass shift and width broadening of the particle in a medium .",
    "many authors have studied these questions for the @xmath0 meson , and also in some cases the @xmath1 meson , at zero temperature in equilibrium nuclear matter , see the reviews of ref .",
    "@xcite and refs . @xcite .",
    "more closely related to this paper is the finite temperature work of rapp _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who have considered the medium modification of the pions comprising the meson , as well as additional medium scattering contributions .",
    "there have also been studies @xcite of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons in a pion heat bath , although we shall see that nucleons produce a larger effect .",
    "qcd sum rules have also been employed @xcite , but these are tailored to the small distance behavior whereas , as eletsky and ioffe @xcite have pointed out , the self - energy is determined by meson - nucleon scattering at relatively large distances of order 1 fm ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "many of these works have relied on effective lagrangians ; however , we would like to adopt as model - independent an approach as possible .",
    "therefore we use experimental data to construct the amplitude for vector mesons scattering from pions and nucleons .",
    "the low energy region is described in terms of resonances plus background , while at high energies a regge model is employed . in principle",
    "the amplitude should be completely determined by the data . in practice",
    "there are uncertainties because the data are often inaccurate and incomplete , particularly for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "it is therefore important to check that the real and imaginary parts of our amplitudes approximately satisfy the dispersion relation which follows from the analytic properties of the amplitude . using our amplitude the in - medium self - energy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "mesons can be calculated at finite temperature and density .",
    "we use the leading term of the exact self - energy expansion @xcite which requires that the densities be sufficiently small that only single scatterings are important . where possible we will compare with results from the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite which has been extensively tested . for the @xmath0 meson this paper represents an updated and improved version of earlier work @xcite hereinafter referred to as eik .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the formalism , parameters and results for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "these are employed in sec .",
    "iii where the self - energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are presented .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "we assume that the self - energies of the isovector @xmath0 and isoscalar @xmath1 vector mesons are dominated by scattering from the pions and nucleons present in a heat bath .",
    "accordingly we need four scattering amplitudes .",
    "we will adopt the two - component duality approach due to harari @xcite ( see also collins @xcite ) which states that while ordinary reggeons are dual to @xmath2-channel resonances , the pomeron is dual to the background upon which the resonances are superimposed . taking for definiteness the case of a @xmath0 meson scattering from particle @xmath3 , we write the forward scattering amplitude in the c.m",
    ". system as @xmath4 here the first term involves a sum over a series of breit - wigner resonances of mass @xmath5 and total width @xmath6 , while the second term is the pomeron background contribution which is discussed in sec .",
    "ii b below .",
    "no background contribution was included in eik @xcite . for the breit - wigner term we have used the non - relativistic form which amounts to setting @xmath7 in the relativistic denominator @xmath8 .",
    "this has a negligible effect on the results we present . in the usual notation @xmath9",
    "is the total c.m .",
    "energy and the magnitude of the c.m .",
    "momentum is @xmath10 [ s-(m_{\\rho}-m_{a})^2]}/\\sqrt{s } \\;.\\ ] ] the statistical averaging factor for spin and isospin is @xmath11 in an obvious notation . since we are averaging over all spin directions we shall not distinguish longitudinal and transverse polarizations .",
    "the isospin averaging implies that all charge states of particle @xmath3 are equally populated so there is no medium - induced mixing @xcite between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . in eq .",
    "( [ lef ] ) @xmath12 represents the partial width for the resonance decay into the @xmath13 channel . if we denote the c.m .",
    "momentum at resonance by @xmath14 , then for @xmath15 we use the value obtained from the total width and the branching ratio on resonance",
    ". however the threshold behavior of the partial width is known and we incorporate this for @xmath16 by replacing @xmath12 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the relative angular momentum between the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 . since the total width is the sum of the partial widths this dependence should be incorporated in @xmath6 .",
    "we do this in the case that @xmath3 is a pion , but when @xmath3 is a nucleon there are many decay channels and it becomes impractical , so we simply take @xmath6 to be a constant .    for the case of @xmath19 scattering",
    "we use the @xmath20 and @xmath21 resonances from manley and saleski @xcite which are listed in table i. these provide a better match onto the high energy region than the fit of vrana _ et al .",
    "it is also necessary to include the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 subthreshold resonances since they make a substantial contribution . in order to estimate the widths we assume that the vector dominance model is valid , even though it is better suited to high energies",
    "this allows us to relate the photon and @xmath0 widths .",
    "specifically , since both resonances are close to the @xmath19 threshold , we can write for each of them @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is @xmath27 c.m . momentum .",
    "then vector dominance gives @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fine structure constant .",
    "for the coupling to the photon we take @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 can be deduced from the decay width and the photon branching ratio of the resonances @xcite .    for the case of @xmath33",
    "much less information is available , although better data is expected in the future @xcite .",
    "therefore we adopt two extreme models with the expectation that reality lies somewhere between the two .",
    "the first we refer to as the two resonance model since , in addition to the subthreshold @xmath23 , we include the two resonances reported by manley and saleski @xcite .",
    "these are the @xmath34 [ @xmath35 mev , branching ratio to @xmath33 0.30 ] and the @xmath36 [ @xmath37 mev , branching ratio 0.49 ] .",
    "it must be stressed that there is uncertainty in these assignments ; for example , vrana _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report @xmath33 strength only for the @xmath36 with a roughly similar width and branching ratio .",
    "for the second model , motivated by the fact that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 differ only in isospin , we use for the @xmath1 the same @xmath38 @xmath20 resonances as for the @xmath0 with the same partial widths , except that we omit the @xmath39 since it decays 7580% in the @xmath19 channel @xcite . in the other cases the errors are sufficiently large that similar @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays could be accomodated",
    "we refer to this as the multi - resonance model .",
    "we also examined the alternative procedure of adopting the decay widths in the @xmath33 channel for the resonances found in the quark model calculations of capstick and roberts @xcite .",
    "we found , however , that the cross section was too small for satisfactory matching onto the high energy part .",
    "turning now to the @xmath40 amplitude , eq .",
    "( [ lef ] ) indicates that a breit - wigner contribution for @xmath2-waves in the limit @xmath41 is a constant since a factor of @xmath42 is included in the partial width .",
    "according to adler s theorem the pion scattering amplitude on any hadronic target vanishes when @xmath41 in the limit of massless pions . in the framework of an effective lagrangian",
    "this can be achieved if a derivative coupling is used for the pion field , @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the term in the lagrangian responsible for @xmath44 involves @xmath43 multiplied by the @xmath0-meson field strength tensor @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath47 field .",
    "this gives an additional factor which should be included for an @xmath2-wave partial width of @xmath48 for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a normalization point .",
    "when @xmath51 this factor is replaced by unity . since this is a soft pion effect it is reasonable to cut it off when @xmath52 , hence we take the normalization point to be @xmath53 .",
    "we believe this is more reasonable than taking the resonance mass for @xmath54 as in eik @xcite .",
    "the analogous factor is also introduced for the @xmath55 resonance .",
    "the parameters @xcite for these and the other meson resonances included in the calculation are listed in table i. for the @xmath56 amplitude only the @xmath57 is listed as having appreciable strength @xcite .",
    "we take it to decay 100% to @xmath56 with a width of 142 mev and apply the adler factor as outlined above .",
    "the high energy forward scattering amplitude is known @xcite to be well approximated by the regge form @xmath58 we shall consider a pomeron term @xmath59 and a regge term @xmath60 . in order to obtain the intercept @xmath61 and the residue @xmath62 for the @xmath63th regge pole trajectory we use the relation between the amplitude and the total cross section given by the optical theorem : @xmath64 .",
    "high energy scattering is dominated by contributions from individual quarks  the additive quark model .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to average over charge states and take the cross section @xmath65 . using the particle data group listing @xcite this gives intercepts @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( the units yield a cross section in mb with energies in gev ) .",
    "we would like to take @xmath70 , averaged over charge states .",
    "of course data for the latter are not available , but for regge exchange in the @xmath71-channel it is appropriate to invoke factorization @xcite so that the residue @xmath72 , using ref .",
    "similarly @xmath73 .",
    "the intercepts @xmath61 are universal .",
    "these parameters yield cross sections which are roughly 30% smaller than in eik @xcite where the @xmath27 and @xmath74 cross sections were employed along with vector dominance .",
    "this , together with the background term in eq .",
    "( [ lef ] ) , allows us to satisfy the dispersion relation ( see below ) significantly more accurately than with the eik parameterization @xcite .    since the different isospin structure of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1",
    "is expected to be insignificant at high energy , we adopt the same parameterization for the @xmath56 and @xmath33 scattering amplitudes as for the @xmath40 and @xmath19 amplitudes .",
    "the parameters for the pomeron obtained here are also used for the background term in eq .",
    "( [ lef ] ) .",
    "note that if the pomeron intercept @xmath75 were exactly 1 , the pomeron amplitude would be pure imaginary .",
    "since we shall work in the rest frame of the heat bath we will give the scattering amplitude for the case that particle @xmath3 is at rest .",
    "this is related to the c.m .",
    "amplitude by @xmath76 where @xmath77 the imaginary parts of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] . in most cases",
    "the low energy part contains a number of overlapping resonances so that the structure is washed out .",
    "the exception is the case of the @xmath56 amplitude where the single @xmath80 resonance is clearly visible ( note that this amplitude is the same in the middle and lower panels ) . because of the kinematics , eq .",
    "( [ kin ] ) , the resonance region ends at @xmath81 gev for @xmath19 and @xmath82 gev for @xmath40 and it is matched onto the regge part slightly beyond these points . at low energies the @xmath19 amplitude is of similar magnitude to the @xmath33 amplitude in the multi - resonance model , but it is much smaller in the two - resonance model .",
    "this is less marked for the real part of the amplitude , given in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , where the two @xmath33 amplitudes are more similar and both are smaller in magnitude than the @xmath19 amplitude in this resonance region .",
    "the pion scattering amplitudes display the change in sign expected for breit - wigner resonances .",
    "this is not seen in the nucleon case because of the subthreshold resonances included here .",
    "these are neglected by kondratyuk _",
    "@xcite which may be the reason that their @xmath19 amplitude becomes slightly positive at small momenta ; it is also somewhat larger in magnitude at large momenta .",
    "they obtained their result from a dispersion integral over an imaginary amplitude constructed from resonances at low energy and vector dominance together with photon cross sections at high energy .",
    "the scattering amplitude should obey a once - subtracted dispersion relation relating the real part to a principal value integral over the imaginary part : @xmath83 thus one can compare the analytical real part of secs .",
    "ii a and b with the result from eq .",
    "( [ di ] ) ; the difference should be the constant @xmath84 .",
    "this does not hold if one uses the regge form for @xmath85 at all energies , the difference only becomes exactly constant if the lower limit of the integration is arbitarily taken to be the point where @xmath86 @xcite . alternatively , if one assumes a pure resonance form for the amplitude the aforementioned difference is not constant either . in both cases",
    "noticeable deviations from constancy start to appear at energies @xmath87 below about 2 gev .",
    "this trend is also seen for the differences when the actual amplitudes are used , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "the nucleon amplitudes give the most reasonable account of the dispersion relation , with the @xmath33 two - resonance case showing a larger deviation from constancy than the other two cases . for pion scattering",
    "the deviations are larger , although it should be borne in mind that the amplitudes themselves are larger too .",
    "of course one would not expect phenomenological approximations to precisely obey the stringent constraints which follow from the analytic properties of the amplitude , and in that light we view the results in fig . [ fig : three ] as reasonable .",
    "we remark that we have considered variations in the parameters involved in the amplitude and have not obtained improvement .",
    "in particular , omission of the background pomeron term in eq .",
    "( [ lef ] ) gives much worse results .",
    "there are inevitable uncertainties in a phenomenological parameterization of a scattering amplitude so it is useful to compare with other work . here",
    "we contrast total cross sections calculated from the imaginary parts of the amplitudes discussed above with those used in the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "the latter employs a resonance description at the lower energies without , however , a background term . at the higher energies",
    "the cern  hera parameterizations @xcite are used , together with the additive quark model , leading to color string excitations .",
    "comparison of the cross sections for scattering from pions in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] shows quite close agreement except at the lowest energies .",
    "here the urqmd cross sections increase because no factor of @xmath88 is included in the width , nor is the adler factor included .",
    "since physically the cross section should go to zero in the chiral limit of massless pions we prefer our result where the cross sections are small .",
    "note that precisely at threshold , @xmath89 , both approaches give a divergent cross section which , however , is of no consequence for the calculation of the self energies .",
    "the corresponding results for the nucleon cross sections are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] .",
    "again there is very close agreement at high energies , but less good agreement at low energies .",
    "for the @xmath0 the basic difference is that urqmd joins the string region to the resonance region at a lower energy .",
    "in fact our cross section compares better with that of kondratyuk _ et al . _ @xcite . for",
    "the @xmath1 cross section only the @xmath34 resonance is included in the urqmd model , whereas we also include the @xmath36 .",
    "this can be seen rather clearly in the lower panel for the two - resonance model .",
    "naturally our multi - resonance model for the @xmath1 bears little resemblance to urqmd ( middle panel ) at low energies , being closer to the @xmath19 case .",
    "apart from this we would say that there is broad agreement between urqmd and the present results .",
    "for a @xmath0 meson scattering from hadron @xmath3 in the medium the contribution to the retarded self - energy @xcite is : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the energy and momentum of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is either a bose - einstein or fermi - dirac occupation number as appropriate for particle @xmath3 .",
    "if the self - energy is evaluated on shell in the rest frame of @xmath3 it is possible to do all the angular integrations , giving @xmath95 f_{\\rho a}\\left(\\frac{m_\\rho \\omega}{m_a}\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath3 is a boson .",
    "if @xmath3 is a fermion @xmath97 has an additional chemical potential contribution @xmath98 and the argument of the logarithm becomes @xmath99/[1+\\exp(-\\omega_+/t)]$ ] .",
    "the total self - energy is given by summing over all target species and including the vacuum contribution @xmath100 here the vacuum part of @xmath101 can only depend on the invariant mass , @xmath102 , whereas the matter parts can in principle depend on @xmath91 and @xmath92 separately .",
    "however , in the approximation we are using the scattering amplitudes are of necessity evaluated on the mass shell of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this means that the matter parts only depend on @xmath92 because @xmath103 is fixed at @xmath104 .",
    "the dispersion relation is determined from the poles of the propagator with the self - energy evaluated on shell , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath105 . taking again for definiteness the case of the @xmath0 we have @xmath106 since the self - energy has real and imaginary parts so does @xmath107 .",

    "we define the mass shift to be @xmath111    we assume that the hadronic matter can be considered to be a weakly interacting gas of pions and nucleons . in order to test this assumption",
    "we have run the urqmd code in a box for baryon densities up to twice normal nuclear matter density at temperatures up to 150 mev .",
    "the results show that more than 95% of all @xmath0-meson scatterings occur from pions and nucleons so that it is reasonable to focus on these interactions .",
    "we will consider nucleon densities of @xmath1120 , 1 and 2 in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density ( @xmath113 nucleons/@xmath114 ) .",
    "we assume that the system is in thermal equilibrium with a temperature below 170 mev so that hadrons are the approriate degrees of freedom rather than quarks and gluons . for densities of 1 and 2 the nucleon chemical potentials are , respectively , 747 and 821 mev at @xmath115 = 100 mev , and 543 and 650 mev at @xmath115 = 150 mev .",
    "anti - nucleons are not included .",
    "the vector meson widths are shown as a function of momentum in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] for two temperatures and three nucleon densities .",
    "note that the widths given here are defined to be in the rest frame of the thermal system .",
    "( the present results replace those of eletsky and kapusta @xcite since the weighting of the pion contribution was too small there due to a computer code error .",
    "the nucleon contributions still dominate , however . ) for @xmath116 the @xmath117 results are little changed from the vacuum value until temperatures of the order of the pion mass are reached . at @xmath118 mev the width generated by collisions with pions is about 50 mev .",
    "this is a factor of two larger than obtained by haglin @xcite using an effective lagrangian , but a little less than the 80 mev reported by rapp and gale @xcite .",
    "interactions with nucleons give a 100 mev contribution to the width at @xmath119 , similar to the zero temperature estimate of kondratyuk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and about twice that at @xmath120 .",
    "thus at the highest temperatures and densities the width is 23 times the vacuum value and is becoming comparable to the mass .",
    "the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] are the same for @xmath117 since nucleons are not involved in this case . here",
    "the effect of increasing the temperature , and therefore the pion density , is much more marked than for the @xmath0 since the vacuum width of the @xmath1 is so small . at @xmath118",
    "mev the width is about 50 mev which is similar to the value obtained by schneider and weise @xcite in an effective lagrangian approach , but a factor of two larger than given by haglin @xcite .",
    "when the nucleon density is non - zero we expect nature to lie somewhere between the larger widths given by the multi - resonance model ( middle panel ) and the smaller widths given by the two - resonance model ( lower panel ) . the functional dependence on @xmath92 differs in the two cases .",
    "however , for a temperature of 150 mev and @xmath119 , @xmath121 is expected to lie between 100 and 150 mev .",
    "this is an enhancement of the vacuum width by a factor of 1218 , which is in line with rapp s estimate @xcite of a factor of 20 at a slightly higher temperature of 180 mev .    in the urqmd model",
    "collisional widths can be obtained by allowing a volume of matter to come to equilibrium at a given temperature and baryon density @xcite .",
    "then the average time between collisions of a @xmath0 meson with a given species , @xmath122 or @xmath123 , can be determined .",
    "the reciprocal of this gives the width due to collisional broadening ( in units with @xmath124 ) . in order for the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium to make sense detailed balance must hold",
    "therefore , for present purposes , it is necessary to drop the string contribution and retain only the resonance contribution @xcite .",
    "thus the results should be most reliable at low momenta .",
    "we show the urqmd results for the collisional broadening due to scattering from pions and nucleons separately in fig .",
    "[ fig : seven ] .",
    "they are compared with the results discussed above for two representative cases of baryon density , @xmath125 , and temperature .",
    "for @xmath126 with @xmath127 mev and @xmath128 with @xmath118 mev , the baryon chemical potentials are 630 and 479 mev , respectively , which correspond to nucleon densities @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with all densities in units of @xmath131 .",
    "the present results agree quite nicely with urqmd at low momenta , suggesting that interference between sequential scatterings can be ignored at these temperatures and densities as we have done .",

    "<S> the mass shift , width broadening , and spectral density for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in a heat bath of nucleons and pions are calculated using a general formula which relates the self - energy to the real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we use experimental data to saturate the scattering amplitude at low energies with resonances and include a background pomeron term , while at high energies a regge parameterization is used . the real part obtained </S>",
    "<S> directly is compared with the result of a dispersion integral over the imaginary part . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks of the spectral densities are little shifted from their vacuum positions , but the widths are considerably increased due to collisional broadening . where possible we compare with the urqmd model and find quite good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> at normal nuclear matter density and a temperature of 150 mev the spectral density of the @xmath0 meson has a width of 345 mev , while that for the @xmath1 is in the range 90150 mev . </S>"
