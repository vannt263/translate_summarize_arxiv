    "a theoretical foundation for understanding complex networks has developed rapidly over the course of the past few years @xcite .",
    "more recently , the subject of detecting network _ communities _ has gained an large amount of attention , for reviews see refs  @xcite .",
    "community structure describes the property of many networks that nodes divide into modules with dense connections between the members of each module and sparser connections between modules .    in spite of a tremendous research effort , the mathematical tools developed to describe the structure of large complex networks are continuously being refined and redefined .",
    "essential features related to network structure and topology are not necessarily captured by traditional global features such as the average degree , degree distribution , average path length , clustering coefficient , etc . in order to understand complex networks ,",
    "we need to develop new measures that capture these structural properties .",
    "understanding community structures is an important step towards developing a range of tools that can provide a deeper and more systematic understanding of complex networks .",
    "one important reason is that modules in networks can show quite heterogenic behavior @xcite , that is , the link structure of modules can vary significantly from module to module . for such heterogenic systems , global measures",
    "can be directly misleading .",
    "also , in practical applications of network theory , knowledge of the community structure of a given network is important .",
    "access to the modular structure of the internet could help search engines supply more relevant responses to queries on terms that belong to several distinct communities . in biological networks",
    ", modules can correspond to functional units of some biological system @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to an analysis of the modularity @xmath0 . identifying communities in a graph",
    "has a long history in mathematics and computer science @xcite .",
    "one obvious way to partition a graph into @xmath1 communities is distribute nodes into the communities , such that the number of links connecting the different modules of the network is minimized .",
    "the minimal number of connecting links is called the _ cut size _",
    "@xmath2 of the network .",
    "consider an unweighted and undirected graph with @xmath3 nodes and @xmath4 links .",
    "this network can be represented by an adjacency matrix @xmath5 with elements @xmath6 this matrix is symmetric with @xmath7 entries .",
    "the degree @xmath8 of node @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "let us express the cut - size in terms of @xmath5 ; we find that @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the community to which node @xmath9 belongs and @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "minimizing @xmath2 is an integer programming problem that can be solved exactly in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "the leading order of the polynomial , however , is @xmath17 which very expensive for even very small networks . due to this fact",
    ", most graph partitioning has been based on spectral methods ( more below ) .",
    "newman has argued @xcite that @xmath2 is not the right quantity to minimize in the context of complex networks .",
    "there are several reasons for this : first of all , the notion of cut - size does not capture the essence of our ` definition ' of network as a tendency for nodes to divide into modules with dense connections between the members of module and sparser connections between modules . according to newman ,",
    "a good division is not necessarily one , in which there are few edges between the modules , it is one where there are fewer edges than expected .",
    "there are other problems with @xmath2 : if we set the community sizes free , minimizing @xmath2 will tend to favor small communities , thus the use of @xmath2 forces us to decide on and set the sizes of the communities in advance .    as a solution to these problems , girvan and newman",
    "propose the modularity @xmath0 of a network @xcite , defined as @xmath18\\delta(c_i , c_j).\\ ] ] the @xmath19 , here , are a null model , designed to encapsulate the ` more edges than expected ' part of the intuitive network definition .",
    "it denotes the probability that a link exists between node @xmath9 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , if we know nothing about the graph , an obvious choice would be to set @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is some constant probability .",
    "however , we know that the degree distributions of real networks are often far from random , therefore the choice of @xmath23 is sensible ; this model implies that the probability of a link existing between two nodes is proportional to the degree of the two nodes in question .",
    "we will make exclusive use of this null model in the following ; the properly normalized version is @xmath24 .",
    "it is axiomatically demanded that that @xmath25 when all nodes are placed in one single community .",
    "this constrains the @xmath19 such that @xmath26 we also note that @xmath27 , which follows from the symmetry of @xmath5 .    comparing eqs .   and",
    ", we notice that there are two differences between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first is that @xmath0 implies that we _",
    "maximize _ the number of intra - community links instead of minimizing the the number of inter - community links as is the case for @xmath2this is the difference between multiplying by @xmath28 and @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the second difference lies in the the introduction of the @xmath19 in equation  .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath19 serves to incorporate information about the inter - community links into the quantity we are optimizing .",
    "use of modularity to identify network communities is not , however , completely unproblematic .",
    "criticism has been raised by fortunato and barthlemy @xcite who point out that the @xmath0 measure has a resolution limit .",
    "this stems from the fact that the null model @xmath30 can be misleading . in a large network ,",
    "the expected number of links between two small modules is small and thus , a single link between two such modules is enough to join them into a single community .",
    "a variation of the same criticism has been raised by rosvall and bergstrom  @xcite .",
    "these authors point out that the normalization of @xmath19 by the total number of links @xmath4 has the effect that if one adds a distinct ( not connected to the remaining network ) module to the network being analyzed and partition the whole network again allowing for an additional module , the division of the original modules can shift substantially due to the increase of @xmath4 .    in spite of these problems ,",
    "the modularity is a highly interesting method for detecting communities in complex networks when we keep in mind the limitations pointed out above .",
    "what makes the modularity particularly interesting compared to other clustering methods is its ability to inform us of the optimal number of communities for a given network term in the eq .   and",
    "is therefore directly linked to the conceptual problems with @xmath0 mentioned in the previous paragraph . ] .",
    "the question of finding the optimal @xmath0 is a discrete optimization problem . we can estimate the size of the space we must search to find the maximum .",
    "the number of ways to divide @xmath3 vertices into @xmath1 non - empty sets ( communities ) is given by the stirling number of the second kind @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "since we do not know the number of communities that will maximize @xmath0 before we begin dividing the network , we need to examine a total of @xmath32 community divisions @xcite . even for small networks , this is an enormous space , which renders exhaustive search out of the question .",
    "motivated by the success of spectral methods in graph partitioning , newman suggests a spectral optimization of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we define a matrix , called the modularity matrix @xmath33 and an @xmath34 _ community matrix _ @xmath35 .",
    "each column of @xmath35 corresponds to a community of the graph and each row corresponds to a node , such that the elements @xmath36 since each node can only belong to one community , the columns of @xmath35 are orthogonal and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38-symbol in equation   can be expressed as @xmath39 which allows us to express the modularity compactly as @xmath40 this is the quantity that we wish to maximize .",
    "the next step is the ` spectral relaxation ' , where we relax the discreteness constraints on @xmath35 , allowing elements of this matrix to possess real values .",
    "we do , however , constrain the length of the column vectors by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a @xmath43 matrix with the number of nodes in each community @xmath44 along the diagonal . in order to determine the maximum , we take @xmath45 + { \\mathrm{tr}}[(\\mathbf{s}^t \\mathbf{s } - \\mathbf{m})\\tilde{\\lambda } ] \\right ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a @xmath43 diagonal matrix of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the maximum is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 for cosmetical reasons .",
    "eq .   is a standard matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "optimizing in the relaxed representation , we substitute this solution into eq .  , and see that in order to maximize @xmath0 , we must choose the @xmath1 largest eigenvalues of @xmath49 and their corresponding eigenvectors . since all rows and columns of @xmath49 sum to zero by definition , the vector @xmath50 is always an eigenvector of @xmath49 with the eigenvalue @xmath51 .",
    "in general the modularity matrix can have both positive and negative eigenvalues .",
    "it is clear from eq .   that the eigenvectors corresponding to negative eigenvalues can never yield a positive contribution to the modularity",
    "thus , the number of positive eigenvalues presents an upper bound on the number of possible communities .    however , we need to convert our problem back to a discrete one .",
    "this is a non - trivial task .",
    "there is no standard way to go from the @xmath3 continuous entries in each of the @xmath1 largest eigenvectors of the modularity matrix and back to discrete @xmath52 values of the community matrix @xmath35 .",
    "one simple way of circumventing this problem is to use repeated bisection of the network .",
    "this is the procedure that newman @xcite recommends . in newman s scheme ,",
    "the only eigenvector utilized is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath53 of @xmath49 ( with highest contribution to @xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xmath52 vector most parallel to this continuous eigenvector , is one where the positive elements of the eigenvector are set to one and the negative elements zero .",
    "this is the first column of the community matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the second column must contain the remaining elements .    we can increase the modularity iteratively by bisecting the network into smaller and smaller pieces . however , this repeated bisection of the network is problematic .",
    "there is no guarantee that that the best division into three groups can be arrived at by finding by first determine the best division into two and then dividing one of those two again .",
    "it is straight forward to construct examples where a sub - optimal division into communities is obtained when using bisection @xcite .",
    "spectral optimization is not perfect  especially when only the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath53 is employed .",
    "therefore , newman suggests that it should only be used as a starting point . in order to improve the modularity",
    ", newman has devised an algorithm inspired by the classical kernighan - lin ( kl ) scheme @xcite .",
    "the procedure is as follows : after each bisection of the network we go through the nodes and find the one that yields the highest increase in the modularity of the entire network ( or smallest decrease if no increase is possible ) if moved to the other module .",
    "this node is now moved to the other module and becomes inactive .",
    "the next step is to go through the remaining @xmath54 nodes and perform the same action .",
    "we continue like this until all nodes have been moved .",
    "finally , we go through all the intermediate states and pick the one with the highest value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the new starting division .",
    "we proceed iteratively from this configuration until no further improvement can be found .",
    "let us call this optimization the ` kln - algorithm ' .    in the spectral optimization ,",
    "the computational bottleneck is the calculation of the leading eigenvector(s ) of @xmath49 , which is non - sparse .",
    "naively , we would expect this to scale like @xmath55 .",
    "however , @xmath49 s structure allows for a faster calculation .",
    "we can write the product of @xmath49 and a vector @xmath56 @xcite as @xmath57 this way we have a divided the multiplication into ( i ) sparse matrix product with the adjacency matrix that takes @xmath58 , and ( ii ) the inner product @xmath59 that takes @xmath60 . thus the entire product @xmath61 scales like @xmath58 .",
    "the total running for a bisection determining the eigenvector(s ) is therefore @xmath62 rather than the naive guess of @xmath55 . using eq .   during the kln - algorithm",
    "reduces the cost of this step to @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "simulated annealing was proposed by kirkpatrick _",
    "et al_.  @xcite who noted the conceptual similarity between global optimization and finding the ground state of a physical system .",
    "formally , simulated annealing maps the global optimization problem onto a physical system by identifying the cost function with the energy function and by considering this system to be in equilibrium with a heat bath of a given temperature @xmath63 . by annealing",
    ", i.e. , slowly lowering the temperature of the heat bath , the probability of the ground state of the physical system grows towards unity",
    ". this is contingent on whether or not the temperature can be decreased slowly enough such that the system stays in equilibrium , i.e. , that the probability is gibbsian @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is a constant ensuring proper normalization .",
    "kirkpatrick et al .",
    "realized the annealing process by monte carlo sampling .",
    "the representation of the constrained modularity optimization problem is equivalent to a @xmath1-state potts model .",
    "gibbs sampling for the potts model with the modularity @xmath0 as energy function has been investigated by reichardt and bornholdt , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "mean field annealing is a deterministic alternative to monte carlo sampling for combinatorial optimization and has been pioneered by peterson et al .",
    "mean field annealing avoids extensive stochastic simulation and equilibration , which makes the method particularly well suited for optimization .",
    "there is a close connection between gibbs sampling and mf annealing . in gibbs sampling ,",
    "every variable is updated by random draw of a potts state with a conditional distribution , @xmath66 where the sum runs over the @xmath1 values of the @xmath9th potts variable and @xmath67 denotes the set of potts variables excluding the @xmath9th node . as noted by @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gibbs2 ] ) is local in the sense that the part of the energy function containing variables not connected with the @xmath9th cancels out in the fraction .",
    "the mean field approximation is obtained by computing the conditional mean of the set of variables coding for the @xmath9th potts variable using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gibbs2 ] ) and approximating the potts variables in the conditional probability by their means @xcite .",
    "this leads to a simple self - consistent set of non - linear equations for the means , @xmath68 for symmetric connectivity matrices with @xmath69 , the set of mean field equations has the unique high - temperature solution @xmath70 .",
    "this solution becomes unstable at the mean field critical temperature , @xmath71 , determined by the maximal eigenvalue @xmath53 of @xmath49 .",
    "this mean field algorithm is fast .",
    "each synchronous iteration ( see section  [ sec : experiments ] for details on implementation ) requires a multiplication of @xmath49 by the mean vector @xmath72 .",
