    "quantum communication and computation offer technological advances by performing information processing with quantum mechanics  @xcite . in order to perform these tasks over large distances , photons are the obvious choice to carry quantum information .",
    "however , transmission over large distances is dramatically hampered by attenuation in optical fibers .",
    "unlike classical fiber optic communication , amplifiers placed periodically along the transmission channel can not be used to overcome this loss owing to the  no - cloning \" theorem  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , quantum repeaters have been proposed to resolve this issue by using entanglement shared between adjacent nodes and joint measurements to create entanglement between the start node and the terminal node  @xcite .",
    "a crucial element in this scheme is the ability to efficiently store and retrieve single photons using a quantum memory  @xcite . to date",
    ", the essential ingredients of a photonic quantum memory have been demonstrated using ensembles of ultracold alkali atoms  @xcite , ensembles of ultracold atoms in cavities  @xcite , warm vapors of alkali atoms  @xcite , ultracold single atoms in cavities  @xcite , and solid - state systems composed of rare - earth dopants in crystals  @xcite . specifically , retrieval efficiencies as high as 73@xmath0 and storage times as long as 3.2  ms have been simultaneously demonstrated using ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the combination of large optical depths and long ground state hyperfine coherence make ultracold atomic ensembles an attractive platform for optical quantum memories .",
    "while there are quantum memory schemes which use probabilistically - generated spin waves from spontaneous raman scattering in atomic ensembles , it has been shown that schemes based on fast ( rates approaching the ghz scale ) single photon or entangled photon sources can provide better performance  @xcite .",
    "thus , one would ideally like a source of quantum light states that is on - demand and bright , meaning it can produce these photons on fast timescales ( broadband ) in a triggered fashion .",
    "in addition , these broadband photons should be indistinguishable so they bunch perfectly on a beamsplitter  @xcite .",
    "a promising source of such on - demand , non - classical light states are epitaxially grown , gaas - based semiconductor quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite .",
    "the short spontaneous emission lifetime of a qd , more than an order of magnitude shorter than that of an alkali atom , and the fact that it is embedded in a robust optoelectronic material make it an attractive candidate as a quantum light source . as an individual two - level system",
    ", the qd naturally emits one photon when it is excited and collection of this photon can be very efficient by proper design of the surrounding dielectric  @xcite .",
    "single photon count rates can in principle approach 1 ghz , with higher rates possible by taking advantage of a purcell enhancement .",
    "in addition , qds have been shown to emit polarization entangled photons by means of a cascaded decay  @xcite . finally , qd - generated photons can have a high degree of indistinguishability  @xcite . aside from these optical properties ,",
    "the internal spin states of charged quantum dots have received considerable attention for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "spin coherence times as along as 1  @xmath2s have been measured  @xcite and because the spin state can be entangled with the polarization of an emitted photon  @xcite , charged quantum dots are a natural candidate for a solid - state qubit that interacts strongly with light .",
    "while qds are promising sources of single or entangled photons , they must be coupled to a high quality quantum memory in order to be a viable source for long distance quantum information processing . here , we investigate the storage and retrieval of a broadband , qd - generated single photon with a 1 ns lifetime in an ultracold , dense ensemble of @xmath1rb atoms .",
    "taking previously measured experimental parameters , we find that the total efficiency ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the storage and retrieval efficiencies ) can exceed 28@xmath0 for storage and backwards retrieval of a photon with a 1  ns lifetime in a @xmath1rb ensemble with an on - resonance optical depth of 150 .",
    "because the bandwidth of the qd photon can approach the excited - state hyperfine splitting in @xmath1rb , this result was obtained by extending the @xmath6-system theory of gorshkov _ et al _ @xcite to a four - level system . using the gradient ascent approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , we determine the maximum efficiency as well as the optimal control pulse for photon storage .",
    "we find that the control pulse can be easily generated using a 12  mw laser diode in contrast to the broadband , raman - based scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite where a mode - locked laser is required . finally , we consider the effects of excess dephasing and spectral wandering of the qd optical transition and show that the memory efficiency remains fairly robust .",
    "these results show that with existing technology , qd - generated photons can be reliably interfaced with ultracold atomic ensembles , paving the way for their future use in quantum information as well as opening interesting avenues in the study of hybrid quantum systems .",

    ", we briefly touch on the main points and restrict the discussion to those schemes described by the theory of gorshkov _ et al _ , namely those based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , off - resonant raman , or photon echo interactions  @xcite . in that work",
    ", these three schemes were shown to yield similar storage efficiencies for the same optical depth of the @xmath6 medium and are in this sense equivalent",
    ". however , there are tradeoffs in the actual physical implementation for these schemes which will be discussed later .    the basic picture of photon storage in such a system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "each atom in the ensemble is composed of two ground states @xmath7 and @xmath8 that can be optically coupled to the excited state @xmath9 .",
    "these two transitions can be individually addressed using a sufficient ground state splitting or by selection rules so as to avoid cross - coupling .",

    ", the control pulse dynamically creates a transparency window in the absorption profile of the @xmath11 transition while adiabatically reducing the group velocity of the quantum field to 0  @xcite . in raman storage",
    ", the control pulse enables the quantum field to be absorbed into @xmath8 by a two - photon raman transition  @xcite . for photon echo storage ,",
    "the quantum field promotes an atom to the excited state @xmath9 and the control pulse transfers the excitation to @xmath8 by performing a fast @xmath15 pulse . in all cases , the quantum field transfers one atom from @xmath7 to @xmath8",
    ", however there is no knowledge of which atom . thus the excitation is coherently distributed over the entire ensemble and it is this collective behavior that makes the process efficient .    the quantum field is now stored in this collective ground state coherence and is therefore sensitive to decoherence processes .",
    "these processes , which can include magnetic field fluctuations or atomic motion , set the limit for the spin wave coherence time , and hence , the duration the photon can be stored .",
    "notably , the spin wave is more robust against decoherence than many other multi - particle entangled states  @xcite",
    ". the spin wave can be re - converted into a photon by using another control pulse ( see fig .  [",

    "this process creates a photon propagating in the opposite direction to its initial propagation .",

    "nonetheless , efficient quantum frequency conversion techniques have been demonstrated using qds  @xcite such that the single photon produced by a qd could be frequency translated to another wavelength without destroying its quantum characteristics .",

    "this becomes especially important at high optical depth and large control fields  @xcite .",
    "one can choose ground states from the same @xmath129 manifold , but then the energy splitting is limited to what can be obtained by zeeman shifting the levels .",
    "for the purposes of qd photon storage , we choose one ground state in @xmath127 and one in @xmath128 .",
    "furthermore , since both states must be coupled to a common excited state , the difference between the @xmath130 values must be between -2 and 2 .",

    "[ sec : intro ] , the long coherence between the hyperfine ground states of @xmath1rb make it very attractive as a quantum memory .",
    "this long coherence is usually limited experimentally by magnetic field fluctuations that cause small zeeman shifts of the @xmath130 levels .",
    "therefore , choosing @xmath130 levels that are common mode to magnetic field fluctuations for the ground states @xmath7 and @xmath8 is crucial to achieving long storage times .",
    "notably , it is not possible to find two states in the same @xmath129 manifold that are common mode to magnetic field fluctuations .",

    "the excess linewidth of quantum dot generated photons can be caused by two distinct physical processes .",

    "the gradient ascent algorithm is implemented using a dynamic step size @xmath59 to guarantee quick convergence .",
    "the step size is determined using an inexact line search such that @xmath59 is initialized to a large value ( 1000@xmath22 ) at each step of the ascent and the increase of @xmath243 and its gradient are calculated at the next step .",
    "if this step does not meet the wolfe conditions  @xcite , the step size is reduced geometrically until they are satisfied .",
    "the optimization proceeds until @xmath243 has not been increased by more than 0.001@xmath243 compared to the average of the three previous values .",
    "this tolerance was estimated by considering the errors resulting from the numerical integration .",
    "errors in the reported efficiencies are @xmath2441  @xmath0 which was determined by examining the variation in efficiencies for perturbations of the time - space grid . for the parameter set",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath102 , @xmath245  mhz , the gradient ascent optimization took approximately 20 minutes on a standard computer .",
    "the pure dephasing process was simulated by first obtaining @xmath171 on a finite grid using ( pseudo-)random numbers drawn from a normal distribution .",
    "then , @xmath170 was calculated using @xmath246 .",
    "averaging over many trajectories yielded the correct diffusion behavior @xmath247 ^ 2 \\rangle = d_{\\phi } \\tau$ ] .",
    "the extracted @xmath4 and @xmath243 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] were obtained by averaging the results of 100 different phase trajectories for each value of @xmath174 .     for the heaviside model and for the three - level ( 3l ) model ( @xmath248  ps ) of the qd photon . ]",
    "the slowly varying photon waveform @xmath77 is not physical due to the infinitely sharp rise of @xmath78 .",
    "a more realistic model might include the non - zero temporal width of the excitation pulse or fast loading of the qd from another excited state .",
    "for the latter , @xmath249 for a three - level model with instantaneous excitation of an ancillary excited state that loads the qd with rate @xmath250 .",
    "for comparison , we have implemented this form of @xmath251 with @xmath252  ps  @xcite using configuration 4 of @xmath85 storage with @xmath253 .",
    "we obtain roughly the same efficiencies ( @xmath254 , @xmath255 ) and peak control rabi frequency ( @xmath256 ) as found in table  [ tab : d2_2_eff ] .",
    "both input photons and control pulses are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : figb_1 ] . because the curves and efficiencies are extremely similar",
    ", we conclude that the infinitely sharp rise of @xmath78 in the simple photon waveform does not dramatically influence the results and is therefore a sufficiently representative choice .",
    "in the preceding analysis , cross - coupling of the control field @xmath12 to the @xmath11 transition was neglected due to the large ground - state hyperfine splitting of @xmath2576.835  ghz . because the control field can be quite strong and the optical depth quite large",
    ", this cross - coupling can lead to detrimental effects that reduce the storage and retrieval efficiencies in practice  @xcite .",
    "of course , a proper choice of ground states and optical polarizations can eliminate cross - coupling completely .",
    "for example , choosing ground states whose @xmath130 values differ like @xmath258 and @xmath259 and using circularly - polarized light allows cross - coupling to be neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "configurations such as @xmath260 and @xmath261 are coupled to the excited state by light of the same polarization . in this case , the control beam can off - resonantly drive the @xmath11 transition as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : figc_1 ] and coherently generate a stokes field @xmath262 in a four - wave mixing ( fwm ) type of process  @xcite .",
    "the stokes field can interfere with the spin - wave created from storage of the quantum field @xmath35 and lead to reduced storage and retrieval efficiencies .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stokes field was taken into account theoretically and was shown to match experimental results quite well .",
    "following the same approach here , we obtain the stokes - modified equations of motion for a three - level system @xmath263 where @xmath262 is the stokes field and the off - resonant interaction @xmath264 has been adiabatically eliminated , leaving an effective coupling between @xmath262 and @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , this interaction induces time - dependent light shifts of + @xmath265 and -@xmath266 for states @xmath9 and @xmath7 respectively . using these equations of motion with the optimized control field for on - resonance storage of a qd - generated photon with configuration 3 of @xmath121 storage with ground states @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) , one obtains the same storage and total efficiencies as in table  [ tab : d1_2_eff ] .",
    "this result indicates that the effect of fwm in this storage scheme is negligible .",
    "another way to determine the relative effect of fwm is to consider the ratio of the last two terms in eq .",
    "[ eqn:3lfwms ] .",
    "the ratio of the fwm term to the normal @xmath267 term should roughly scale as @xmath268 , which is approximately 2@xmath269 for typical parameters considered here .",
    "compared to typical parameters found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the onset of fwm effects was measured , this ratio is about three orders of magnitude smaller so fwm can be safely neglected .",
