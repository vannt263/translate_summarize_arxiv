    "since the first claim of hemispherical power asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies @xcite as measured by the wmap satellite in its first - year observation , a growing number of papers on the subject have appeared in the literature .",

    "a dipolar modulation has also been considered , in the literature . in @xcite",
    "the data resolution is lowered and a modulation of the cmb signal is assumed for angular scales up to a maximum multipole considered , @xmath3 . instead ,",
    "@xcite proposed the use of an optimal quadratic estimator on full - resolution data , finding mild evidence for a dipolar modulation at large angular scales .",
    "they show that the effect strongly depends on the choice of @xmath3 and that it decreases if the higher multipoles are included in the analysis .",
    "a re - analysis of the latter has been presented by the wmap team @xcite , where the connection between the asymmetry and the cutoff scale is further investigated .",
    "however , the polarization sector remains poorly explored in this context .",
    "@xcite investigated the properties of the cmb polarization field on the two hemispheres defined by @xmath0 @xcite , exploiting an implementation of the quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) method @xcite .",
    "no significant anomalies in the polarization and temperature - polarization cross - correlation were found in wmap 5-year data @xcite .",
    "dipolar modulations in temperature and polarization have been studied in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .    in the present work we test the hemispherical power asymmetry at large scale on wmap 7-year temperature and polarization maps without any theoretical assumptions . by sampling the whole sky in 24 equally - spaced symmetry axis , we test the power asymmetry on as many pairs of hemispheres . for each of those ,",
    "we compute the same figures of merit as we did in our previous work @xcite .",
    "moreover , we analyze the dependence of our results from the parameter @xmath4 along the lines suggested in @xcite , showing that our conclusions are only mildly affected by any _ a posteriori _ choice .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the methodology , the estimators and the dataset of our analysis . in section 3 we present our results assessing their significance by monte carlo simulations . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implications of power asymmetries in polarization for non - isotropic models . in section 5",
    "we draw our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the algebra of the qml estimator , we define the 24 pairs of hemispheres under investigation and describe our dataset , simulations and estimators .      in order to evaluate the angular power spectra",

    "given a map in temperature and polarization @xmath5 , the qml provides estimates @xmath6 - with @xmath7 being one of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 - of the angular power spectrum as :    @xmath14 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where the fisher matrix @xmath15 is defined as    @xmath16 \\,,\\ ] ]    and the @xmath17 matrix is given by    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the global ( signal plus noise ) covariance matrix and @xmath20 the fiducial power spectrum .",
    "although an initial assumption for a fiducial power spectrum @xmath21 is needed , the qml method provides unbiased estimates of the power spectrum contained in the map regardless of the initial guess , @xmath22 where the average is taken over the ensemble of realizations and @xmath23 denotes the underlying model .",
    "the covariance matrix associated to the estimates is the inverse fisher matrix , @xmath24 and it does depend on the assumption for the fiducial power spectrum @xmath21 : the closer the guess to the true power spectrum is , the closer are the error bars to minimum variance . according to the cramer - rao inequality , eq .",
    "( [ minimum ] ) tells us that the qml has the smallest error bars .",
    "we thus call the qml an ` optimal ' estimator .      in order to uniformly sample the sky ,",
