    "thin shell components can be found in many large built - up mechanical structures such as cars , ships , and aeroplanes .",
    "the prediction of the mid- and high- frequency vibrational properties of these structures becomes computationally prohibitive for standard element - based methods , such as the finite element method @xcite .",
    "the main reasons for this limitation are : firstly , very fine meshes are required for an adequate representation of the highly oscillatory wave solutions and the computational complexity grows with frequency raised to the power of the dimension of the space being modelled . secondly , small uncertainties originating from the manufacturing process lead to a much larger variability in vibro - acoustic responses in the high frequency range @xcite , meaning that the response of any individual manufactured structure is of less interest to computer aided engineering practitioners than the average responses .    methods such as statistical energy analysis ( sea ) @xcite and ray tracing @xcite are more commonly applied for modelling wave problems at high frequencies .",
    "sea has traditionally proved more popular for structural vibration problems with low damping @xcite , whereas ray tracing has found its niche in applications where relatively few reflections need to be tracked in computer graphics @xcite , room acoustics @xcite and seismology @xcite .",
    "ray tracing has also been applied to elastic wave transmission problems on shells and plates @xcite . in this context",
    "the ring frequency , that is the frequency above which longitudinal waves in a curved shell behave as they would in a flat plate , provides a useful point of reference . beyond the ring frequency",
    "the ray dynamics in a curved shell are relatively simple following geodesic paths , but below the ring frequency one finds that asymptotic ( ray ) theories show richer features .",
    "the dispersion relations become highly anisotropic with likewise anisotropic propagation @xcite .",
    "an sea treatment would fail to capture the non - trivial way in which the curved shell geometry influences the wave and ray propagation below the ring frequency @xcite , and hence ray methods can provide useful insight @xcite .",
    "wave scattering from discontinuous line joints below the ring frequency has been considered in @xcite .",
    "however , manufacturers of large built - up mechanical structures are increasingly developing larger and lighter sub - components , whereby large thin shell structures are replacing more traditional plate - beam and multi - plate assemblies .",
    "the manufacturing process for such thin shells often entails casting molten metal ( for example aluminium ) , which gives rise to curved components with smooth transitions between flat and curved regions .",
    "this raises the question of how the ray and wave scattering , and hence the vibrational properties of the structure , are modified in these smooth designs . in this work",
    "we study the case of a singly curved shell , chosen here as an assembly of two plates joined smoothly with a quarter of a cylinder .",
    "this simplified assembly represents a typical curved region within one of the larger sub - structures described above .",
    "we shall go beyond plane waves and ray tracing calculations by solving the full wave scattering problem numerically .",
    "the numerical solution to the full wave scattering problem will be discussed in comparison with the corresponding ray tracing calculations . in both cases",
    "we find effective laws for the scattering properties , which may be inserted into ray or wave propagation modelling techniques such as dynamical energy analysis ( dea ) @xcite or the wave and finite element method @xcite .",
    "in particular , combining these local scattering models within a larger model of a built - up structure will lead to a hybrid method for structures including curved thin shell components in the mid - frequency regime . here",
    ", the natural definition of the mid - frequency regime is given by the range of frequencies that are high enough for a pure fem analysis to be impractical , but low enough so that a simple geodesic description of the trajectory evolution is invalid . in the high - frequency case ,",
    "dea @xcite can be applied to model the vibrational energy transport of a built - up structure along geodesic paths using the mesh data from a fem analysis @xcite .",
    "in fact , dea presents a link between ray tracing and sea by casting the wave or ray problem into the language of evolution operators .",
    "we note that an equivalent operator formalism has also been long known in computer graphics @xcite , although the theory underlying dea arose from the more general setting of evolution operators for transporting flows in dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the organisation of the article is as follows : we introduce the necessary shell theory and derive a wave scattering model for a singly curved shell in sect .",
    "we then present two approaches for solving the wave scattering model ; a short wavelength asymptotic ray tracing model based on this shell theory is detailed in sect .",
    "[ sec : raytrac ] , and a finite difference discretisation of the full wave model is described in sect .",

    "we assume an isotropic shell of thickness @xmath1 , young s modulus @xmath2 , density @xmath3 and with poisson ratio @xmath4 .",

    "the tangential displacements @xmath12 in the directions @xmath13 , respectively , satisfy @xcite @xmath14 the term @xmath15 represents the inverse of the first fundamental form as explained in [ sec : tensors ] .",

    "in addition , structural damping may be incorporated in the usual way by replacing the young s modulus @xmath2 in the equations above with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the damping loss factor .",

    "the incident , reflected and transmitted waves in @xmath19 are also indicated . ]    in this section we simplify the shell theory presented above for the case of a cylindrical ridge as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ridgegeom ] .",
    "the only simplifying assumption is that the shell is not curved with respect to the direction @xmath25 .",
    "we define the principal curvature @xmath26 ( in the direction @xmath27 ) as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant corresponding to the maximum curvature in the cylindrical region .",
    "a smoothly varying curvature with respect to @xmath27 is obtained via the interpolation function @xmath30 given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the centres of the transitions between the two flat regions where @xmath33 and the cylindrical region where @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : curv ] . also , @xmath35 is the width of the transition region .",
    "note that the case of a non - smooth joint between a cylindrical ridge and a pair of connecting plates is obtained in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "a cylindrical ridge with a prescribed bending angle @xmath37 can be designed by integrating the angular increment @xmath38 to find the total length @xmath39 of the curved section of the geometry such that @xmath40 for the desired angle .",
    "the length @xmath39 is then found by numerically solving the implicit equation ( [ eq : angleinc ] ) . in this work",
    "we take a quarter cylinder with @xmath41 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ridgegeom ] .    in the above described geometrical setting ,",
    "the shell theory presented in the last section is simplified considerably if we choose an orthonormal basis @xmath42 along the axes @xmath43 .",
    "we then measure all tensor fields relative to this basis , that is , we work in physical components .",
    "the metric becomes @xmath44 and so the first fundamental form and its dual both reduce to the identity matrix @xmath45 therefore the raising and lowering of indices becomes trivial .",
    "the second fundamental form @xmath10 in the basis @xmath42 is simply @xmath46 and zero for all other combinations of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the covariant derivative ( see [ sec : tensors ] ) , likewise reduces considerably since all derivatives vanish for the metric ( [ eq : metricid ] ) .",
    "hence , all christoffel symbols vanish and the covariant derivative is identical to the directional derivative , i.e. @xmath49 . applying the above simplifications in the shell equation for the normal displacement ( [ eq : pdesys1 ] ) and assuming that material constants and the thickness are constant yields the following equation @xmath50 where we write @xmath51 and @xmath52 for simplicity of notation .",
    "we adopt this notation for the remainder of the paper since we are no longer considering differential equations written in tensor form . repeating the simplification process for the in - plane wave equation system ( [ eq : pdesys2 ] ) gives @xmath53 \\label{eq : pdesys2b}\\frac{\\rho h}{c }   \\frac{\\partial^2 u^2}{\\partial t^2 } = & \\:\\frac{\\partial^2 u^2}{\\partial y^2}+\\frac{(1+\\nu)}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2u^1}{\\partial x \\partial y}+\\frac{(1-\\nu)}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2u^2}{\\partial x^2}+\\nu\\kappa\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , a simplified set of partial differential equations ( pdes ) describe the wave motion in the cylindrical ridge shell geometry under consideration here .",
    "in the next section we discuss how under certain modelling assumptions , this system can be reduced further to a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "in this work we are primarily interested in how the scattering properties of a thin shell cylindrical ridge depend on the frequency and the direction of a prescribed incident plane wave originating in the flat region ( where @xmath54 ) . as such it makes sense to consider time - harmonic waves with angular frequency @xmath55 .",
    "further , we can extract scattering properties that are independent of the position along the ridge by exploiting the translational symmetry and assuming that the ridge is of infinite extent in the @xmath56direction . under these assumptions",
    "we may write @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the component of the wavenumber in the @xmath56direction and @xmath59^\\text{t}$ ] are the coefficients of ( [ eq : odeansatz ] ) in the in - plane directions @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the normal direction , respectively .",
    "substitution of the ansatz ( [ eq : odeansatz ] ) into the pde system ( [ eq : pdesys1a ] ) - ( [ eq : pdesys2b ] ) yields the following fourth - order ode system in the variable @xmath60 : @xmath62\\label{eq : odesys2 } c_s^2\\:\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^2 v}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^2}+\\left(\\omega^2-c_p^2k_y^2\\right)v+\\mathrm{i } k_y\\left((c_p^2-c_s^2)\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}u}{{\\mathrm{d}}x}+\\nu c_p^2\\kappa \\hat{w}\\right)&=0,\\\\[2pt]\\label{eq : odesys3 } \\frac{b}{\\rho h}\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^4 \\hat{w}}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^4}-2k_y^2\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^2 \\hat{w}}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^2}+k_y^4\\hat{w}\\right)+(c_p^2\\kappa^2-\\omega^2)\\hat{w}+c_p^2\\kappa\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}u}{{\\mathrm{d}}x}+i\\nu k_y v\\right)&=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the constants in the above system have been simplified by writing them in terms of the pressure and shear wave velocities , @xmath63 respectively .",
    "in particular , we have made use of the following easily verified relations @xmath64 later in the paper we will write the above ode system in the shorthand form @xmath65 for brevity of exposition .",
    "we connect the curved region to flat plates on each side using interfaces .",
    "imposing a set of conditions at these interfaces will enable us to formulate the set of odes ( [ eq : odesysb ] ) as a boundary value problem , and then by considering the flux of the incoming and outgoing wave fields at these interfaces we are able to formulate a scattering problem .",
    "we assume that the interfaces reside in the asymptotically flat regions and as such the interfaces themselves do not give rise to reflection / transmission phenomena , only the interior region between the interfaces governs the scattering properties .",
    "each interface is assumed to satisfy the continuity conditions given in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , continuity of displacement , rotation , traction , moment , and normal shear stress . since the material properties are constant throughout the entire geometry , then the interface conditions may be written simply as @xmath66    the superscripts specify the value of the quantity as we approach the interface from either the interior region @xmath67 containing the ridge , or the exterior flat region @xmath68 beyond the interfaces on either side of the ridge . in the sequel",
    "we will refer to the interior region as @xmath69 , and the union of the exterior regions as @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : curv ] ) .",
    "the waves in @xmath19 are precisely those of classical plate theory and therefore the wave modes in @xmath19 that are scattered by @xmath20 will be one ( or more ) of bending , pressure , shear or evanescent bending type . in relation to the vector @xmath70",
    "we have that @xmath71 describes the sum of the bending wave contributions and that the in - plane wave types will each be given by a linear combination of @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this work",
    "we consider only incident bending modes @xmath74 originating in the exterior @xmath19 and being scattered by the ridge in @xmath69 . however , the extension to other incident wave types is straightforward . for the purpose of investigating directional properties",
    "we consider plane wave scattering .",
    "we introduce the notation that the interface to the left of @xmath69 is located at @xmath75 and the interface to the right is correspondingly at @xmath76 .",
    "then an incident wave of unit amplitude travelling in from the left of @xmath20 can be written in the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the wave - number associated with the incident bending mode in the @xmath60-direction . in order to write the resulting scattered waves in a concise manner we introduce @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then the scattered waves in @xmath19 may be written @xmath81 where @xmath82 designates the scattered wave type as either bending ( @xmath83 ) , evanescent bending ( @xmath84 ) , pressure ( @xmath85 ) or shear ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath87 designates whether the scattered wave is reflected ( @xmath88 ) or transmitted ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "that is , whether the scattered wave emerges in @xmath19 on the same side of the ridge as the incident wave is sent in , or on the other side .",
    "the value of @xmath48 also prescribes the sign in the @xmath90 as negative for @xmath91 and positive for @xmath92 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath93 denotes the corresponding wave amplitude , which are related to @xmath70 via the following relations @xmath94 v^{\\beta}(x)=&a^p_\\beta\\exp(\\pm \\mathrm{i } k^p_x x_\\beta)\\sin\\theta\\pm a^s_\\beta\\exp(\\pm \\mathrm{i } k^s_x x_\\beta ) \\cos\\theta,\\\\[2pt]\\label{eq : wrt } \\hat{w}^{\\beta}(x)=&a^b_\\beta\\exp(\\pm \\mathrm{i } k^b_x x_\\beta)+a^e_\\beta\\exp(-k^b_x |x_\\beta|).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath95 is the angle between the scattered wave directions and the @xmath96axis ( positive or negatively oriented depending on the direction of propagation ) .",

    "@xcite , for which the reflection takes place off - centre at a fixed location only .",
    "that is , for the models presented in refs .",
    "@xcite the reflection would take place at the location of the jump in the curvature between the flat region and the cylindrical region .",
    "this would be off - centre in the example here , since the centre point @xmath24 corresponds to the centre of the cylindrical region .    in the next section we consider an equivalent scattering problem to the one above , but instead using the finite difference model described in the previous section to numerically solve the full wave problem .",
    "the full wave model will include the phase information omitted in the pure ray approximation applied in this section , but at the cost of a computational expense which scales with frequency .",
    "such a study is feasible up to reasonably high frequencies due to the one - dimensional setup of the problem derived in sect .",
    "however , the high frequency purely transmissive behaviour for the problem here is relatively straightforward to predict , and we find that both methods may be used for the more interesting mid - frequency case studied here .",
    "we restrict the study to bending excitations as in the previous section . for smooth joints",
    "this means that only the bending mode is active , with negligible conversion to in - plane modes .",
    "that is , the scattering probabilities become @xmath173 ) with very small @xmath35 in the interpolation function ( [ eq : interp ] ) , mode conversions appeared in the numerics at almost normal incidence .",
    "we defer the study of this case to future work and note the possibility of using discontinuous joints instead for this case .",
    "note that we use the term probabilities to describe the coefficients defined in ( [ eq : prob ] ) since for an incoming bending wave of unit amplitude ( [ eq : winc ] ) , conservation of energy gives that @xmath174 . in the full wave picture considered here these coefficients ( [ eq : prob ] )",
    "actually give the proportions of reflected and transmitted wave energy .",
    "however , for comparison with the ray tracing results in the last section , they give the probabilities of reflection and transmission for a particular incoming trajectory .     plotted on a linear scale .",
    "the plot shows anti - resonances close to @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 . there is a switch in the dominant behaviour from transmission to reflection close to @xmath178.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     plotted on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the logarithmic scale emphasises the anti - resonance reflection peaks and the switch from transmission to reflection that were evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : coeff].,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the dependence of the reflection and transmission probabilities on the value of the trace wave number @xmath168 is shown in fig .",

    "[ sec : scatscheme ] for both @xmath179 and @xmath180 grid points in @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath181 m and @xmath182 m , respectively .",
    "the ratio of wavelength to @xmath137 is @xmath183 for the case @xmath179 and hence the rule of thumb requiring 6 points per wavelength for reliable results suggests that in both cases our results should be reasonably well converged .",
    "this convergence is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : coeff ] , since it is difficult to detect differences between the plots for @xmath179 and @xmath180 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : coeff ] shows that the scattering coefficients of the full wave problem include discrete anti - resonance points ( points of perfect reflection ) that were not present in the ray tracing calculation .",
    "in addition , the threshold behaviour from transmission to reflection has been smoothed in the full wave calculations , whereas for the ray tracing solution there is a sudden jump from transmission to reflection corresponding to the location of the hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "hence , for the calculations in this section there is a region of @xmath168 values where both reflection and transmission take place at the same time .",
    "this region lies roughly between @xmath184 and @xmath185 , but one observes an obvious switch from dominant transmission behaviour to dominant reflection behaviour at a threshold value around @xmath186 , which is close to the threshold estimate ( @xmath187 ) from the corresponding ray tracing calculation .",
    "it appears therefore that the asymptotic ray model slightly over predicts the transmission / reflection threshold compared with the full wave solution , but still produces a reliable estimate within around @xmath188 of the total @xmath168 range .",
    "a more complete picture appears when the scattering coefficients are plotted on a logarithmic scale , see fig .",
    "[ fig : logcoeff ] .",
    "we can then clearly identify the discrete reflection points in the region of perfect transmission . the dips or peaks",
    "can be arbitrarily close to zero , or unity , depending on the resolution of the plot .",
    "the discrepancy between the finite difference solution for the reflection coefficient with @xmath179 and @xmath180 is also more evident in this figure since the logarithmic scaling amplifies the differences at very small values of @xmath189 below @xmath190 .",
    "however , the positions of the anti - resonances and the switch from transmission to reflection remain in excellent agreement for both @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",

    "note that there is no mode conversion and so the in - plane contributions @xmath72 and @xmath73 only have support on the curved region and vanish in @xmath19 . in the case of reflection ( @xmath194 ) and transmission ( @xmath192 )",
    "the expected behaviour is observed .",

    "[ fig : wfmiddle ] , the bending wave continues through the ridge without significant deformation from the shape of the initial plane wave excitation .",
    "this is equivalent to the corresponding ray tracing result .",
    "however , if @xmath168 is chosen coincide with one of the anti - resonance peaks in the transmission region that were not present in the ray tracing result , then the bending wave field is localised in the central cylindrical region ; for example , at @xmath177 as shown in plot ( f ) of fig .",

    "we have investigated bending wave scattering across a smoothed plate and quarter cylinder configuration in the interesting mid - frequency case , close to the ring frequency for the cylinder .",
    "results have been obtained in a simplified and effectively one - dimensional setting using both a high - frequency ray - tracing approximation and a finite difference discretisation of the equivalent full - wave problem .",
    "previous studies on plate and cylinder connections have concentrated on joints having discontinuous curvature where reflections can occur , however the smoothed joints considered here also give rise to reflections within the cylindrical part of the structure .",
    "furthermore , the ray tracing calculations suggest the existence of a threshold incident wave direction which separates waves or rays that exhibit reflective or transmissive behaviour .",
    "this threshold direction is also evident from the smoothed transition between reflection and transmission observed in the full wave calculations .",
    "hence , relatively simple scattering laws can be employed to model the propagation of structure - borne noise in shells , and ultimately in built - up structures containing thin shell components .",
    "the full wave solution shows that in addition to the switch from transmission to reflection as the incident wave direction becomes increasingly oblique , there are also anti - resonances giving rise to perfect reflection at a discrete set of directions where transmission would typically be expected . in these cases",
    "the wave functions appear as trapped modes that localise in the cylindrical part of the configuration .",
    "there are several avenues for further research , including extensions to multiply - curved and fluid - loaded shells .",
    "in addition , the scattering laws could be incorporated within computed aided engineering simulations of built - up structures via wave methods , such as the wave and finite element method or dynamical energy analysis .",
