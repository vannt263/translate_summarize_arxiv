    "since the seminal paper by peimbert & costero ( 1969 ) discussing the empirical methods to obtain the chemical abundances , planetary nebulae ( pn ) observations have been used to derive the chemical composition of the interstellar gas in the galaxy ( for example , peimbert and torres - peimbert 1971 ) , as well as in nearby galaxies ( for example , ford et al .",
    "the results have been used for different purposes including pn classification ( peimbert 1978 , 1990 , fandez - abans & maciel 1987a ) and abundance gradient determination ( fandez - abans & maciel 1986 , 1987b ) .",
    "the empirical method used to derive the elemental chemical abundance from emission lines depends on the gas temperature and electron density ( mccall 1984 ) .",
    "the temperature is obtained from the observed [ o iii ] line ratio ( t@xmath1 ) , from the [ n ii ] line ratio ( t@xmath2 ) , or from the balmer discontinuity ( t@xmath3 ) , and usually give different values . on the one hand ,",
    "the difference between t@xmath1 and t@xmath2 is probably due to the fact that o@xmath0 and n@xmath4 are in different regions , respectively at the high- and low - ionization zones . on the other hand ,",
    "a t@xmath1 higher than t@xmath3 is generally explained by the presence of temperature fluctuations ( peimbert 1967 ) . very accurate data for a large sample of pn show that the difference between t@xmath3 and t@xmath1 can reach up to 6000 k ( liu & danziger 1993 ) .",
    "as discussed by the authors , such a value can not be reproduced by photoionization models of un - clumped gas . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of unresolved condensations could solve the problem ( viegas & clegg 1994 ) , indicating that t@xmath3 is probably a better indicator of the gas temperature . in this case",
    ", the elemental abundances must be derived assuming t@xmath3 instead of t@xmath1 .",
    "ionic abundances derived from both collisionally excited and recombination lines of c and o may also indicate the presence of temperature and/or density fluctuations in planetary nebulae , as recently discussed by mathis , torres - peimbert and peimbert ( 1998 ) .",
    "abundances derived from recombination lines are usually higher than those from collisionally excited lines .",
    "regarding the abundance gradient in the galaxy , it indicates that the abundances are higher closer to the galactic center . since the oxygen lines are the main coolants , the gas temperature of the pn must be lower closer to the galactic center . in addition , the forbidden line emissivities increase rapidly with the gas temperature reaching a plateau for t @xmath5 5 x 10@xmath6k .",
    "thus , a change in the gas temperature from t@xmath1 to t@xmath3 must induce a bigger change in the abundance of the pn closer to the center , and , consequently , a change of the abundance gradient of the galaxy .    in this paper , we quantify the systematic error in the abundance gradient due to an overestimation of the gas temperature , using a monte carlo method .",
    "the data sample is discussed in  2 . the method used and the results are presented in  3 .",
    "the conclusions appear in  4 .",
    "as proposed by peimbert ( 1978 ) , the pn of the galactic disk can be classified in type i , ii and iii .",
    "however , our sample includes only type ii pn , which are probably more representative of the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "in fact , they are relatively young , produced by intermediate mass stars and participate in the galactic rotation ( maciel & dutra 1992 ) . on the contrary , type i pn",
    "are probably very young and their chemical abundance would correspond to the present interstellar abundance ( maciel & kppen 1994 ) , while type iii pn have probably originated from old less massive stars and could be displaced from their birthplace ( maciel & dutra 1992 ) .",
    "previous gradient determinations were obtained using the abundance values provided by different authors .",
    "some of them included objects for which the t@xmath1 or the electron density could not be calculated , so the abundances were derived assuming a given value for these quantities . in order to estimate the systematic error in the galatic abundance gradient induced by an overestimation of the temperature ,",
    "we need a homogeneous sample of abundance data . since the data available in the literature come from different observations and authors , it was necessary to recalculate the empirical abundances for all the objects in the sample from the observed emission - line intensities . for this ,",
    "the optical line intensities necessary to calculate the temperature from the [ o iii ] and [ n ii ] line ratios , the density from the [ s ii ] line ratio , as well as the ionic fractional of the ions present in the gas , are needed . therefore , among all the type ii pn data in the literature , only those with those line intensities available , as well as the galactocentric distance , were selected .",
    "these criteria reduced the sample to 43 objects listed in table 1 with the corresponding references .",
    "the adopted distances come from maciel & kppen ( 1994 ) .",
    "we are interested in analysing systematic errors in the elemental abundance gradient derived from pn .",
    "usually the gradient is obtained from abundance data available in the literature . in our case , we need a homogeneous sample , i.e. , the elemental abundance must be derived by the same method , in particular using the same equations for the ionic fractions and ionization corrections .",
    "following peimbert & costero ( 1969 ) , the empirical method used to derive the chemical abundances is based on the observed optical lines and depends on the temperature and electron density of the emitting region . here",
    "the emission line used are : [ o ii]@xmath7 3727 , [ o ii]@xmath7 7327 , [ o iii]@xmath7 4363 , [ o iii]@xmath7 4959 + 5007 , [ n ii]@xmath7 6548 + 6584 , [ ne iii]@xmath7 3868 + 3967 , [ s ii]@xmath7 6717 , [ s ii]@xmath7 6730 , [ s iii]@xmath7 6312 , he i @xmath7 5876 , he ii @xmath7 4686 and h@xmath8 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the temperature of the high and low ionization regions are given , respectively , by the [ o iii ] and [ n ii ] line ratios . because the dispersion of most of the observations is not enough to separate the [ o ii ] doublet , the electron density is obtained from the [ s ii ] line ratio .",
    "once the physical conditions of the emitting regions are obtained , the ionic abundances , relative to h@xmath9 , are calculated from the observed emision - line intensities corrected for reddening .    the ionic abundances for o@xmath9 , o@xmath0 , n@xmath9 , ne@xmath0 , s@xmath9 and s@xmath0 have been obtained using the emission line coefficients from mccall ( 1984 ) . however , since there are unobserved ions present in the gas , ionization correction factors are adopted in order to obtain the elemental abundances , as shown in equations 1 to 4 below .",
    "the ionic abundances of he@xmath4 and he@xmath0 have been obtained from brocklehurst ( 1972 ) and the corrections for collisional de - excitation of he@xmath4 adopted from kingdon and ferland ( 1995 ) .",
    "the total helium abundance is the sum of the ions he@xmath4 and he@xmath0 since the neutral helium in those objects is negligible .",
    "@xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12 } .\\ ] ]    @xmath13    the calculated elemental abundances are listed in table 1 .",
    "these values are used to derive the standard abundance gradient , @xmath14 , in the absence of temperature fluctuations .",

    "the reason for the different results are mainly due to the collisional term included in the estimate of the he@xmath9 fractional abundance and in the icf value used for s / h .    the he@xmath9 fractional abundance is used as the icf correction for the o abundance ( eq .",
    "1 ) , and an incorrect value may afffect all the results derived from it .",
    "the main problem comes from collisional correction of he@xmath9 . in some of the previous papers",
    "this correction is not accounted for ( freitas pacheco et al .",
    "1992 ) , leading to an overabundance of the he@xmath9 fractional abundance , and consequently , of the he abundance .",

    "1991 ) as proposed by clegg ( 1987 ) which may overcorrect he@xmath9/he ( kingdon and ferland 1995 ) , leading to an underestimate of the he abundance .",
    "however , for the objects listed in table 1 , the results using clegg s correction or kingdom and ferland correction for he i @xmath75876 differ by less than 3 % .",
    "regarding the s abundance , the icf used by different authors has changed over the years leading to different results .",
    "two decades ago , an icf similar to the icf for n was assumed ( barker 1978 ) , followed by a more precise value ( barker 1983 ) . however , several authors ( for example freitas pacheco et al . 1991 and references therein )",
    "used the icf value suggested by dennefeld and stasinska ( 1983 ) , based on photoionization models for hii regions . because the hii region ionizing stars have lower temperatures , the high ionization zone of hii regions is smaller than in planetary nebulae , leading to a smaller ionization correction factor due to the presence of highly ionized ions .",

    "the icf is usually the same in all works .",

    "three of these distant pn are usually classified as type i planetary .",
    "however , they were reclassified as type ii by maciel and quireza ( 1999 ) and included in their sample . since they have high ne abundance , their ne abundance gradient is flatter . without these pn in the sample ,",
    "the ne gradient is -0.042 @xmath26 0.014 ( quireza 1999 ) , which is in agreement with our result ( table 3 ) within the errors .",
    "if the balmer temperature were available for most of the type ii pn , a new value for the galactic abundance gradient could easily be obtained by recalculating the chemical abundances for each object assuming t@xmath3 as the gas temperature .",
    "as shown by viegas & clegg ( 1994 ) , if the difference between t@xmath1 and t@xmath3 is due to density fluctuations , the oxygen and neon abundance may increase up to 50 % .",
    "this would resolve the discrepancy between the elemental abundances derived from permitted lines and from forbidden lines .",
    "the value of t@xmath3 is not available for most of the pn of our sample , thus the estimation of the systematic error , introduced into the abundance gradient by an uncertainty in the gas temperature , is obtained by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the method is similar to that used by steigman , viegas and gruenwald ( 1997 ) . for each pn",
    ", we assume that the t@xmath1 is overestimated by @xmath30 t chosen from a distribution ranging from zero to @xmath30 t@xmath31 , following a probability p(@xmath30 t ) , which can be constant , linear increasing or linear decreasing . thus",
    ", if a constant p(@xmath30 t ) is assumed for each object , any value of @xmath30 t between 0 and @xmath30t@xmath31 has the same probability to be randomly chosen .",
    "on the other hand , if a linear increasing ( or deacreasing ) probablility is assumed , higher ( or lower ) @xmath30 t values are favored .",
    "once the type of probability and @xmath30 t@xmath31 are chosen , the chemical abundances are recalculated for each pn in the sample using t = t@xmath1 - @xmath30 t for the high ionization zone , as described in  2.1 .",
    "a new value of the elemental abundance gradient , @xmath22 , is then obtained by linear fit for each element , as well as the difference @xmath30@xmath22=@xmath22 - @xmath14 . the procedure is repeated 15,000 times and the @xmath30@xmath22 average value gives the estimate of the systematic error in the gradient due to an overestimation of the gas temperature .    since the difference between t@xmath1 and t@xmath3 is not easily explained , a possible overestimation of t@xmath2 must be also analized .",
    "there is no reason to adopt the same change @xmath30 t for t@xmath1 and t@xmath2 .",
    "in fact , no correlation was found between these two temperatures ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in addition , for most of the pn , t@xmath2 is close to t@xmath3 .",
    "thus , when calculating the systematic error in the abundance gradient , only a decrease in t@xmath1 is accounted for ; t@xmath2 remaining constant .",
    "the pn sample observed by liu & danziger ( 1993 ) shows that the difference between t@xmath1 and t@xmath3 can reach up to 6000 k , although most objects show a difference less than 4000 k. this value will be assumed as the maximum in our calculations .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulations are shown in table 4 and 5 , for @xmath30t@xmath31 equal to 4000 k and 2000 k , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the results obtained with a lower t@xmath1 is to steepen the gradients .",
    "because of the rapid increase of the line emissivity with the gas temperature and of the expected increase of the pn gas temperature from inner region to the outer region of the galaxy , we expect that the increase of the abundance , due to a decreasing of t@xmath1 , is stronger for the pn closer to the center , leading to a steeper gradient .",
    "this effect is found for all elements .",
    "although the n and s abundances are not directly dependent on t@xmath1 ( as o and ne abundances are ) , steeper gradients are also obtained .",

    "the fe / h gradient was -0.095 dex kpc@xmath32 ( friel 1995 ) , but recent results indicate a flatter gradient in agreement with the o / h gradient from the b stars ( friel 1999 ) . the temperature effect discussed in this paper could also apply to hii regions , and we would expect that the corresponding abundance gradient would also be steeper , approaching the former value obtained from open clusters , although o and fe are produced by different progenitors .",
    "however , two important issues are _ how to explain the observed gradient and how constant it is during the galactic evolution_.    a value for the radial abundance gradients as precise as possible is of fundamental importance for the chemical evolution models of our galaxy ( e.g. chiappini 1998 ) the abundance gradient is an important constraint on the models , since it is not restricted to the solar vicinity as are most of the other constraints .",
    "the temporal and spatial behavior of the gradient depends on the star formation rate and on the gas density distribution in the disc .",
    "regarding chemical evolution models , different authors adopt different prescriptions for the input parameters , and different solutions are obtained .",
    "some constraints are satisfied by different models , however , the abundance gradient is one of the few that may really determine the model .",
    "the model discussed by chiappini ( 1998 ) gives an o gradient of - 0.04 dex / kpc for the inner part of the galaxy , which is too flat .",
    "she suggests that if radial flows are included in the model the theoretical o gradient could become steeper .",
    "as shown in this paper , the real elemental abundance gradient may be steeper than previously assumed , and it may then imply that radial flows must really be accounted for in future models .",
    "we are indebt for discussions with r. b. gruenwald , w. j. maciel and r. costa .",
    "we are also thankful to an anonymous referee whose useful comments greatly improved this paper .",
