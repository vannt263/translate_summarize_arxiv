    "the potential use of white dwarfs ( wds ) as chronometers has long been recognised .",
    "the relative accuracy of stellar age estimates based on up - to - date models , combined with the long evolutionary timescales of wds and their abundance in most galactic systems , means this approach has been used to age a wide variety of stellar configurations .",
    "these include wd - subdwarf binaries ( monteiro et al .",
    "2006 ) , single burst populations such as globular and open clusters ( hansen et al . 2007 ;",
    "von hippel & gilmore 2000 , jeffery et al .",
    "2007 ) , and continuous populations such as the galactic disk ( winget et al .",
    "1987 , oswalt et al .",
    "1995 , leggett et al .",
    "the standard tool used for this technique is the luminosity function ( lf ) for wds , which contains information on both the absolute age and the star formation history of a stellar system .",
    "the star formation history is essentially imprinted on the entire lf , and authors working on parametric forms for the lf ( eg .",
    "noh & scalo 1990 ) predict bumps and inflexions corresponding to changes in the rate of star production in the past .",
    "the absolute age is constrained by the marked downturn in the lf at faint magnitudes , where the cooling ages of wds converge on that of the population as a whole .",
    "modern surveys that apply this to the galactic disk have suffered from small observational samples of faint wds at the lf turning point .",
    "this is confounded by the fact that the atmospheric physics of such ` ultracool ' wds is currently poorly understood , with only a handful of stars extensively studied ( eg bergeron & leggett 2002 ) .",
    "the largest lf measurement currently published is that of harris et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , using a sample of 6000 wds selected from a combination of the sdss and usno - b .",
    "the presence of only 4 stars beyond the turning point precludes any accurate constraint on the lf at these magnitudes .",
    "we are working on a program to measure the wdlf by exploiting data from the all - sky supercosmos sky survey ( sss ) .",
    "sensitive proper motion detection combined with accurate photometry over wide angles enables large samples of wds to be catalogued using reduced proper motion methods . in section 2",
    "we outline the sss , and go on to descibe our survey procedures in sections 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "we present our lf in section 6 , and discuss the limitations and possible future refinements in section 7 .",
    "the supercosmos sky survey was compiled by digitizing several generations of photographic schmidt plate surveys .",
    "the photographic source material includes the poss - i and poss - ii surveys in the northern hemisphere , and a combination of eso and serc surveys in the south . over 1700 fields",
    "are required to cover the entire sky , with each field being observed in four photographic bands @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 and @xmath9 in the north / south respectively . only @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath8 are normally used for photometry , @xmath9 being generally of poorer quality and very similar in response to @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath9 is used to provide an early epoch for improved astrometric solutions in each field .",
    "the subscripts refer to particular filter / emulsion combinations , and will be dropped throughout the rest of this paper",
    ". we will sometimes refer to @xmath9 and @xmath7 as first- and second - epoch @xmath10 respectively . due to reasons outlined in section [ propermotionerrors ] ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to objects detected at all four epochs . the survey data is housed in relational databases available online at ` http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/ssa/ ` .",
    "an introduction to the sss and further technical details can be found in hambly et al .",
    "we avoid the galactic plane by @xmath11 and the centre by @xmath12 .",
    "these regions are heavily affected by blending and poor photometric calibration due to differential extinction within the field .",
    "we also reject six fields centred on the magellanic clouds for the same reasons .",
    "this gives a total sky coverage of 10.2 sr , or about 80% of the sky .",
    "taking into account the regions lost around bright stars due to diffraction spikes and scattered light haloes , the total survey area is 9.4 sr , or just over 75% of the sky .",
    "the supercosmos image analysis mode software measures 32 parameters for each object detection , some of which we restrict in order to ensure our final wd catalogue only contains objects with reliable , high quality images .",
    "we only accept objects with the _ deblending flag _ set to zero , meaning no image fragmentation has been detected .",
    "quality number _ is an integer indicating situations encountered during image analysis , such as proximity to a bright star or plate boundary , and is set such that increasingly severe circumstances are assigned higher values .",
    "we restrict this parameter to values less than 128 . the _ profile classification statistic _",
    "@xmath13 gives a magnitude - independent measure of the ` stellarity ' of an image , by quantifying the deviation of the radial profile slope from that of the mean stellar template .",
    "it is scaled to a zero mean , unit variance gaussian distribution .",
    "objects with @xmath14 are rejected .",
    "previous studies utilising digitized schmidt plate data have placed cuts on the ellipticities of images , in order to limit contamination by faint galaxies and noise .",
    "however , we have found that the ellipticities measured by supercosmos are extremely noisy at intermediate to faint magnitudes , and that any intuitively sensible cut will result in a seriously incomplete sample of stars .",
    "this may be due in part to the eight - fold nearest neighbour pixel connectivity employed by the supercosmos image analysis software .",
    "we have decided to ignore this parameter .",
    "the northern half of the sss data was digitized from photographic copies of poss - i and poss - ii survey originals . unfortunately",
    ", this seems to have degraded the quality of the data , resulting in erroneous astrometric fits for a fraction of objects .",
    "this may be due to the photographic copying process rendering blended objects harder to detect .",
    "certainly , the distribution of the astrometric residuals for affected objects deviates significantly from the expected @xmath15 form , indicating that something is going wrong with the centroiding .",
    "this problem first became obvious when we started to analyse the reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram for the northern hemisphere ( see section [ methods ] ) , and noticed an extended population of objects at high values of rpm , in approximately the same region as cool wds .",
    "this is what is expected if the proper motions of objects no longer correlate with distance - essentially , stars with bad proper motions are scattered from their usual locii and any discrimination between distinct galactic and stellar components is lost .",
    "the main consequence for this work is that the highly numerous disk main sequence stars tend to scatter into the wd region , completely swamping the cool wd locus .",
    "unfortunately , this contamination can not adequately be removed by simply applying judicious selection cuts on the image parameters , and we have been forced to devise a new statistic to identify these objects .",
    "this statistic is calculated using the known distributions of @xmath15 ( astrometric fit residuals ) and @xmath13 for both reliable and unreliable objects .",
    "the main result is that bad objects are successfully removed by placing a selection cut on this new statistic , and that a certain fraction of good objects are also removed .",
    "this fraction can be precisely measured and corrected for in later analysis , given that this statistic is independent of magnitude , colour and proper motion .",
    "the upper limit on proper motions is set to @xmath16 yr@xmath3 for the entire survey .",
    "this arises from the mean epoch spread and reliable pairing radius between consecutive observations in each field .",
    "this limit is not so important for producing large stellar catalogues , due to the lower probability of stars having such motions .",
    "note , however , that nearby ultracool wds and halo stars are expected to show larger motions . to produce a large sample of stars , we reduce the lower proper motion limit as far as possible while maintaining a 5@xmath17 proper motion detection threshold on all objects .",
    "this level has been chosen to limit observational scatter in the rpm diagram .",
    "our lower limit is thus dictated by the proper motion errors , which in general differ from field to field due to varying time baselines and plate quality , and within individual fields are a function of apparent magnitude , due mostly to centroiding precision as detailed in section 2.2.5 of hambly et al 2001c .",
    "it is natural therefore to allow our lower proper motion limit to vary from field to field , and to make it a function of apparent magnitude within each field . in general",
    ", there is no analytic form for the distribution of proper motion errors with apparent magnitude , and a numerical solution has to be found .      for every survey field , we plot the proper motion uncertainty @xmath18 against @xmath19 for all objects .",
    "many fields share the same general form for this distribution , in particular a minimum of @xmath20 mas yr@xmath3 at around @xmath21 , rising to considerably larger errors at brighter and fainter magnitudes .",
    "objects detected on only three plates show a similar distribution offset to larger @xmath18 by up to @xmath22 yr@xmath3 . rather than attempting to define a separate lower proper motion limit for these objects , we simply discard them .",
    "we wish to find the upper boundary of this distribution , denoted @xmath23 .",
    "we may then define our @xmath24-threshold lower proper motion limit at every magnitude by simply multiplying this function by 5 .",
    "@xmath23 is estimated by first binning objects according to magnitude , interactively so that each bin contains 100 points , which allows reasonable estimation of @xmath23 at the extremes where objects are of low density .",
    "this results in @xmath25 bins , where @xmath26 and is typically of the order of 100 .",
    "each of the @xmath25 points @xmath27 is then defined by the largest @xmath18 at the mean @xmath19 value in each bin , after rejecting the top 3% of points as outliers .",
    "the set of points @xmath27 shows considerable noise on small scales , and is processed through one stage of smoothing to remove this .",
    "a savitzky - golay filtering technique is used ( savitzky & golay 1964 ) , generalized to allow for non - regular data .",
    "this results in a final set of @xmath25 points @xmath27 , which are interpolated linearly to define @xmath23 at all magnitudes .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of the proper motion error distribution and @xmath23 for one field .",

    "the magnitude completeness of catalogues derived from schmidt plates has been analysed extensively in the literature .",
    "we follow a similar approach to tinney , reid and mould ( 1993 ) , except that with nearly 8000 schmidt plates in  1700 fields it is unfeasible to model the differential stellar and galactic number counts in each .",
    "we proceed by assuming that within each of the eight photographic surveys compiled into the sss the completeness of each plate is an identical function of the plate detection limit .",
    "this allows for the considerable variation in depth of plates within each survey .",
    "we estimate the _ completeness function _ for each survey , using a subset of five fields chosen at high galactic latitude , in order to reduce the effects of image crowding and interstellar extinction . the completeness function is defined to be the fraction of objects recovered as a function of apparent magnitude , and relies on an estimate of the intrinsic stellar and galactic number counts in each field .",
    "figure 2 shows the typical number count histograms for observed and modelled data in one field .",
    "intrinsic stellar number counts are modelled using the besancon galaxy model ( robin et al .",
    "these will generally be different in each field due to different lines of sight through the galaxy .",
    "conversely , galaxy number counts are assumed to be isotropic , with the large ( @xmath28 ) fields smoothing out any small scale structure .",
    "suitable empirical counts have been published by many authors ( eg jones et al .",
    "2001 ) , and in this study we use those compiled by the durham cosmology group . in log - number space the galaxy counts are well fitted by straight lines in each band over the range of interest .",
    "the completeness function in each field is given by @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "for each survey we obtain five measures of @xmath29@xmath31 , which are individually shifted according to the plate depth then averaged to obtain @xmath32@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is magnitudes above the plate limit .",
    "uncertainties are assigned from the sample variance of the individual measures .",
    "the resulting eight functions are used to define dynamic magnitude limits for the remaining fields in each survey .",
    "one such function is presented in figure 3 .",
    "the offset from the plate limit chosen as the completeness limit ( @xmath35 ) for each survey is given in table 1 , along with the corresponding mean magnitude limits for each band .",

    "the _ reduced proper motion _ statistic @xmath37 uses the correlation between proper motion and distance to estimate the absolute magnitude of nearby stars , and is commonly employed for identifying extremely sub - luminous wds in proper motion surveys .",
    "the fact that @xmath38 can be expressed in quantities intrinsic to the star @xmath39 suggests that we can use stellar and kinematic models to predict the range of @xmath38 for wds of various colour and velocity .",
    "this allows us to perform rigorous selections on @xmath38 to produce well defined catalogues of wd candidates .",
    "this is done in the @xmath38-colour plane , where an appropriate colour - magnitude relation can be used to find the regions inhabited by wds of various tangential velocity .",
    "figure 4 shows the reduced proper motion diagram ( rpmd ) for our objects .",
    "this is topologically similar to the hr diagram .",
    "cooling tracks for wds with hydrogen and helium atmospheres and a range of @xmath40 are plotted .",
    "wds of larger tangential velocity are located below these lines , and we select objects from below the da track as our wd candidates .",
    "cool wds of low velocity share identical values of @xmath38 with subdwarfs in the high velocity tail of the halo , so these two populations overlap to some extent in the rpmd .",
    "contamination by subdwarfs can be reduced by applying a minimum tangential velocity threshold to the kinematic selection of wds .",
    "this essentially selects wd candidates from regions more widely separated from the subdwarf locus .",
    "the fraction of wds that fall below the chosen @xmath40 threshold can be corrected for by including a ` discovery fraction ' .",
    "this is calculated by projecting the wd velocity ellipsoid onto the sky , and integrating the resulting @xmath40 distribution over the range of allowed velocities , according to the prescription of murray ( 1983 ) . as each line of sight",
    "sees a slightly different projection of the velocity ellipsoid , this has to be done separately for each survey field .",
    "we assume the velocity ellipsoid for disk wds matches that of local dm stars measured by reid et al 1995 , and set @xmath41 = ( 43,31,25 ) kms@xmath3 with an asymmetric drift of -22 kms@xmath3 relative to the local standard of rest .",

    "we use a simple variance - weighted least - squares fitting procedure , and reject objects with @xmath46 .",
    "such objects are mostly unresolved binaries , as detailed in section [ wddm ] . with only one degree of freedom",
    "we can not measure the gravity or atmosphere type of each star , so we assume @xmath47 for all stars and fit both hydrogen ( da ) and helium ( db ) atmospheres .",
    "over- and under - massive wds exist in roughly equal proportion , and fitting them with normal - mass atmospheres has opposite effects and so should ( roughly ) cancel out .",
