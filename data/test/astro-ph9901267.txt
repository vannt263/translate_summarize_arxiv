    "whenever a radically new wavelength or sensitivity regime is opened in astronomy , new classes of object and unexplained phenomena are discovered .",
    "the iras satellite , in opening the mid- to far - ir sky , revealed that the bolometric luminosities of many galaxies are dominated by this spectral region .",
    "this has raised questions concerning the evolution of galaxies in the mid- to far - ir , the role of dust - extinction in the formation of galaxies , the relationship between quasars and galaxies , and the nature of galaxy formation itself .",
    "limited as they were to fluxes not much smaller than 1jy , the iras surveys were constrained to the fairly local universe for the vast majority of the detected objects .",
    "the evolutionary properties of ir galaxies , both the normal galaxy population and the unusual ultra- and hyper - luminous objects ( see e.g. clements et al .",
    "1996a ) , are thus still mostly unknown .",
    "recent work in the visible and near - ir has had a major impact on our understanding of the star formation history of galaxies ( eg .",
    "steidel et al . , 1996 ,",
    "cowie et al . , 1994 ,",
    "giavalisco et al . , 1996 , lilly et al . ,",
    "it appears that the star formation rate in the universe peaked at around z=1 and has been declining since ( madau et al .",
    "many of the objects studied in deep , high redshift fields appear to be distorted , and are possibly undergoing tidal interaction or merging ( abraham et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "it is well  known that tidal interactions and mergers in the local universe produce significant amounts of star formation ( joseph & wright , 1985 , clements et al .",
    ", 1996b , lawrence et al . , 1989 ) , and that these are usually associated with a significant luminosity in the mid- to far - ir .",
    "the dust responsible for this emission is heated by the star formation process , which it also obscures .",
    "we must thus consider that the view of the universe obtained in the visible and near - ir , corresponding to the rest - frame optical and near - uv of many of the objects observed , may well be biased by such obscuring material .",
    "the question of how much of the star - formation in the universe is obscured by dust thus becomes important .",
    "this issue can only be properly addressed by selecting objects in the mid- or far - ir which are less affected by such obscuration .",
    "previous work in the mid- and far - ir used data from iras , with all - sky sensitivities of @xmath40.1 jy in the mid - ir bands ( 12 and 25 @xmath0 m ) , and @xmath4 0.31 jy at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "these typically allow the detection of galaxies out to z=0.2 , though a few exceptional objects , such as the gravitationally lensed z=2.286 galaxy iras10214 + 4724 ( rowan - robinson et al . , 1991 , serjeant et al . , 1995 ) ,",
    "have also been detected .",
    "most evolutionary studies with iras have concentrated on the 60@xmath0 m waveband ( sanders et al . , 1990 , hacking & houck , 1987 , bertin et al . , 1997 ) . this work has found evidence for strong evolution in the 60@xmath0 m population , at rates similar to those of optically selected agn , but the nature of this evolution is still unclear , and it is difficult to extrapolate to higher redshift with any confidence .    at mid - ir wavelengths , the iras mission has produced both large - area surveys of fairly nearby objects ( eg .",
    "rush et al . , 1993 ) , and small - area , deep surveys in repeatedly scanned regions ( eg . hacking & houck , 1987 ) .",
    "the former surveys do not probe sufficiently deeply into the universe to be able to say much about galaxy evolution , but they do have the advantage that plentiful data exists for the nearby galaxy samples they produce .",
    "the latter surveys are plagued by stellar contamination .",
    "the vast majority of the 12@xmath0 m objects in the survey of hacking et al .",
    ", for example , are stars  there are only five galaxies in their entire survey .    the infrared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al . 1996 ) provides a major improvement to our observational capabilities beyond those of the iras satellite . for observations in the mid - ir , the isocam instrument ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) allows us to reach flux limits @xmath4100 times fainter than those achieved by iras while observing fairly large areas ( @xmath40.1 sq . degree ) in integration times of only a few hours .",
    "we can thus probe flux regimes that were previously impossible to study .",
    "this paper presents the results of a survey of four high galactic latitude fields using the lw10 ( 12@xmath0 m ) filter , which was specifically designed to match the 12@xmath0 m filter on the iras satellite .",
    "the present results can thus be compared to existing iras data with minimal model - dependent k- corrections .",
    "this survey is much deeper than any based on iras data , and is sufficiently deep to detect distant galaxies .",
    "the survey region is also fairly small and at high galactic latitude , so that stellar contamination should not be a major problem .",
    "there are of course other studies in the mid - ir underway using the iso satellite .",
    "these include the deep and ultradeep surveys ( elbaz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , the elais survey ( oliver et al . , in preparation ) and the isohdf project ( oliver et al . , 1997",
    "; desert et al . , 1998 ( paper i ) ; aussel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "all of these programmes use the lw2 6.7@xmath0 m and/or lw3 15@xmath0 m filter on iso .",
    "only the isohdf results have been published to date . at 15@xmath0 m",
    "these observations reach a flux limit of @xmath40.1 mjy , about 5 times deeper than the observations discussed here , but cover only 1/24th of the area .",
    "there are also deep surveys at longer wavelengths using the phot instrument at 175@xmath0 m ( kawara et al .",
    ", 1998 , and puget et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "future missions will also be probing this part of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the first of these will be the wire mission ( fang et al . ,",
    "1996 ) which will obtain a large area , deep survey at 12 and 25@xmath0 m .",
    "the sirtf project ( werner & bicay , 1997 ) and iris satellite ( okuda , 1998 ) will also be used for deep number counts , and should be able to probe significantly deeper than iso .",
    "finally the planned ngst ( stockman & mather , 1997 ) will provide incomparable performance in this cosmologically interesting waveband .",
    "the present work provides the first results of the exploration of the distant universe at these mid - ir wavelengths , and can provide a guideline for future missions , useful for their planning and preparation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations , data reduction and calibration .",
    "section 3 provides details on identifications of the 12@xmath0 m source population , star - galaxy separation , and on individual source properties .",
    "section 4 discusses number counts , comparison with statistics at other wavelengths , and with model predictions .",
    "section 5 summarises our conclusions .",
    "the observations presented here were part of a survey of cometary dust trails ( iso project name jdavies / jkdtrail ) .",
    "the original goal was to observe the width and structures of the cometary trails , which are produced by large particles , ejected from the comet into independent heliocentric orbits but with very similar orbital elements and very small radiation pressure effects .",
    "the comet 7p / pons - winnecke was selected because of its similarity to other comets with dust trails , the detection of a dust trail by iras ( sykes & walker , 1992 ) and its suitability for observation by iso .",
    "four fields were imaged , each field being a raster map centred on the ephemeris prediction for particles with the same orbital elements as the nucleus except for the mean anomaly of the orbit , which was shifted by @xmath5 ( ahead ) and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( behind ) .",
    "each raster was 11 by 7 pointings , with a spacing of @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "the pixel field of view was @xmath11 , so that there was substantial overlap between individual frames of the 32 by 32 pixel isocam lw array ( cesarsky et al . , 1996 ) to ensure good flatfielding and high observational redundancy .",
    "a typical position on the sky was visited 12 times during the raster , each time with a different pixel of the array .",
    "the rasters were rotated such that the predicted cometary trail would run parallel to the short axis of the raster .",
    "unfortunately for the cometry trails programme , the observations took place on 17 august 1997 , one day later than assumed for the ephemeris calculations and therefore the trail is predicted to run horizontally across the very bottom edge of the image .",
    "based on the results of observations of the trail of another comet ( p / kopff ) from the same observing program ( davies et al . , 1997 )",
    ", we expect that the trail would occupy at most the lower @xmath12 of the image and that it would be relatively smooth .",
    "the presence of the dust trail in the field should not have any effect on the observations presented here , though an excess of sources in the bottom of the raster could potentially be related to structures in the dust trail .",
    "no such excess is seen .",
    "all observations presented here are in the lw10 filter , which is very similar to the iras 12 @xmath0 m filter in wavelength - dependent response .",
    "since these fields are at high galactic lattitude ( @xmath1350 degrees ) , and , in the absence of cometary trails , are effectively blank fields , they become ideal for a deep survey of the extragalctic 12@xmath0 m source population .",
    "the positions of the fields are given in table  [ fields ] .",
    "the data reduction process is described in detail in paper 1 . basically , for each aot file ( total 4 ) the raw data ( cisp format ) and pointing history ( iiph format ) are read and merged . the raw data cube ( typically 1244 readouts of 32 by 32 pixels )",
    "is deglitched for fast and slow cosmic ray impacts .",
    "a transient correction is applied to recover the linearity and the nominal flux response of the camera . a triple  beam method",
    "is then applied to the processed data cube , in order to find the best ( on- ( off1+off2)/2 ) differential value of the sky brightness for each pixel and each raster position , where off1 and off2 refer to the previous and next raster position value for the same camera pixel .",
    "the resulting low  level reduced cube is then simply flat  fielded ( there is no need for a dark correction because we perform a differential measurement on the sky ) .",
    "the flat  fielded reduced cube along with an error cube is made up of 77 values for each of the 32 by 32 pixels of the camera .",
    "the 2 cubes are then projected onto the sky using an average effective position for iso during each raster position , with a @xmath14 optimal weighting .",
    "a noise map is thus calculated as well as a sky differential map .",
    "any given source will leave 2 negative half ",
    "flux ghosts 60 arcseconds away on both sides along the raster scan direction .",
    "this is a trade  off in order to beat the 1/f noise regime that is reached by the camera for long integrations per position . on the final map , shown in fig .",
    "[ images ] , we search for point sources with a gaussian fitting algorithm that uses the noise map for weighting the pixels and deducing the noise of the final flux measurement .",
    "a fwhm of 9 arcseconds was used .",
    "the final internal flux is converted to @xmath0jy by using the isocam cookbook value ( cesarsky et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "the present understanding of isocam calibration is that no additional factor should be applied to the pre - flight sensitivity estimates for the determination of surface brightness .",
    "we have devised a scheme to assess the reproducibility of the sources , in order to test for false sources that would be due to undetected glitches .",
    "this is described in detail in paper i , but consists of breaking the observations of each object into a number of independent subsurveys .",
    "sources are deemed reliable if they are detectable , with suitably reduced significance , in each of these subsurveys .",
    "of the 193 sources above the 3@xmath1 limit only 7 fail the reproducibility test ( 4% ) and these are not considered in the following .",
    "visual screening helped in removing a further 38 residual companions of strong sources due to imperfect fitting .",
    "visual screening also showed that two sources , f1_0 and f2_0 , were significantly extended at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "we thus use aperture photometry to obtain an accurate flux for these objects .",
    "the aperture used had a diameter of 20 arcsecs .",
    "simulation of the expected psf from iso after the same processing reveals that part of the flux is missed by the optimised gaussian fitting .",
    "we therefore correct the fluxes and errors by a factor of 1.52 determined from this modelling .",
    "the final absolute photometry should be in error by no more than an estimated 30% .",
    "the fluxes are given at the nominal wavelength of 12 @xmath0 m ( i.e. an additional correction of @xmath15 is applied since the nominal isocam calibration is for a wavelength of 11.5@xmath0 m ) , in order to facilitate the comparison with previous iras observations .",
    "this assumes a flat spectrum in @xmath16 as was used for iras calibration .",
    "the flux prediction for known stars should thus be colour corrected , since they have a rayleigh - jeans spectral index , in order for comparison to isocam measurements : the real flux at 12@xmath0 m should be divided by 0.902 .",
    "an additional factor comes from the fact that the psf is smaller for stellar sources ( which are dominated by the short wavelength part of the broad filter ) than for the assumed extragalactic sources which have a broader spectrum .",
    "thus the real flux should also be multiplied by a supplementary factor of 1.13 ( see section 3.1 for this _ a priori _ calibration and the comparison with flux measurements of known stars in the fields ) .",
    "the basic calibration of isocam , before the corrections for point sources are applied , can be checked by comparing the integrated surface brightness of these fields with values interpolated from the dirbe experiment on cobe ( hauser et al .",
    "the iso surface brightnesses agree with the dirbe values to better than 5% .",
    "the sensitivity that is achieved in the central area of the fields is about @xmath17jy .",
    "this was achieved with a total integration time of 4 minutes for each camera field  of  view .",
    "astrometry was assessed by matching iso sources to bright stars in the fields .",
    "we estimate the astrometric accuracy to be @xmath46  ( 2 @xmath1 ) .",
    ".details of 12@xmath0 m survey fields [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     predicted fluxes are calculated as described in the text .",
    "a star is described as having a candidate ir excess if its predicted flux is less than half the measured flux .",
    "[ stars ]    we are then able to remove all 13 stars from the 12@xmath0 m source lists generated in this survey , and can thus examine the statistics of faint galaxies at 12@xmath0 m .",

    "nevertheless , it is a useful check of the processing to note that the only iras galaxy within the survey region has been detected by isocam .",
    "integral number counts from a survey with homogeneous sensitivity are calculated by summing up the number of sources to a given flux limit , and then dividing by the survey area : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the area of the survey . however , in our case the noise in the survey is inhomogeneous ( it has a bowl - like shape ) since the border pixels were observed with smaller integration times .",

    "similarly some galaxies close to but above the flux limit will be scattered out of the catalogue .",
    "however , since there are many more galaxies at fainter fluxes , more galaxies will be scattered above the flux limit than below it . number counts that are uncorrected for this bias thus show a steep rise in counts towards the faintest flux levels . in the case of gaussian noise and",

    "these counts are derived from two different isocam filters ( lw10 and lw3 ) with rather different response functions .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "6 , there appears to be a clear offset between the two differential galaxy counts by roughly a factor 2  4 ( though the two bins with overlapping fluxes are in formal agreement ) . no simple model can explain this shift in the counts by such a large factor over such a narrow flux interval .",

    ". such an approach may be useful for understanding the present work and its relation to the isohdf data .",
    "however , assumptions would have to be made about the nature of the faint mid - ir galaxy population , and whether it was significantly different from the local galaxies studied in detail by iras and iso .",
    "there are already suggestions from the isohdf that there are more and bigger starbursts in the faint mid - ir selected galaxies than in the local population ( rowan - robinson et al . , 1997 ) .",

    "a proper test of models of this population is thus even more critically dependent on obtaining the redshifts of individual sources than similar work at optical or far - ir wavelengths .",
