    "multiobject spectroscopy of globular cluster candidates in the halo of m104 was obtained using fors1 at the eso vlt in service mode in april 2000 .",
    "five mos setups were observed with exposure time @xmath6 min each with the 600b grism and 1@xmath7 wide slitlets , yielding a resolution of @xmath8   ( fmhm ) .",
    "all the available 19 movable slits were used , giving the highest priority to globular clusters spectroscopically confirmed by bridges and coll .",
    "@xcite . in total 75 objects were observed , including candidates visually selected on the basis of their shape and magnitude . since most targets were observed in more than one mask , the typical target exposure time is 200 min .",
    "long - slit spectra of galactic globular clusters spanning a wide range in metallicity were also obtained for radial velocity and line strength calibration .",
    "the mos spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated using iraf standard tasks .",
    "the cross - correlation task fxcor was employed to measure radial velocities , using integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters as templates , and checking the velocity systematics against synthetic spectra of simple stellar populations @xcite . in total 57 objects",
    "were confirmed to be globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy on the basis of their radial velocities , 27 of which are new .",

    "absorption line indices were measured for all the confirmed clusters , after convolving the spectra with an appropriate wavelength - dependent kernel to match the resolution of the lick / ids system .",
    "the line strengths were measured using the passbands defined by worthey et al . @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the template galactic globular clusters were compared with previous index data @xcite to put our measurements on a standard system .",
    "small offsets were applied to some indices ( e.g. , mg1 , mg2 ) , while no corrections were needed for narrow - band indices such as mg@xmath10 .",
    "the correlations between different metal line indices are well defined and give a consistent picture of metal line strengths in the m104 globular clusters .",
    "analysis of the relative abundances of iron - peak versus @xmath11-elements , and comparison with models including non - solar abundance ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) , will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the metallicities of globular clusters in m104 were derived following the empirical approach based on the index - metallicity relations for galactic clusters .",
    "weighted mean metallicities were calculated using several indices @xcite .",
    "the assumptions behind the empirical calibrations are that clusters in m104 are as old as those in the milky way , and the abundance ratios follow the same trend with metallicity as in the milky way globular cluster system .",
    "this approach has the advantage of providing a robust , model - independent ranking based on direct comparison of the line strengths in the target clusters with those of the milky way globulars .",

    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ f_heldf1 ] for the mg2 versus [ fe / h ] relation .",
    "the non - linearity is confirmed by the spectral synthesis models , and was previously noticed by others ( @xcite , @xcite ) . as a result , a straightforward extrapolation of the original linear calibrations above [ fe / h]@xmath9 would seriously overestimate the metallicity of the stronger - lined clusters . as a simple approximation of the non - linear behavior of mg2 and other indices , we adopted two different slopes for clusters below and above [ fe / h]@xmath13 . for clusters less metal - rich than this value ,",
    "our calibration is identical to the original one @xcite .",
    "details on the new relations for very metal - rich clusters , as well as abundances derived from comparisons with models , will be given elsewhere .",
    "we find a range in metallicity from [ fe / h]@xmath14 to [ fe / h]@xmath15 with a mean value [ fe / h]@xmath16 .",
    "some clusters with super - solar abundances are indeed present in m104 .",
    "very few clusters appear to be more metal - poor than [ fe / h]@xmath17 .    diagnostic diagrams of balmer line strengths against metal line indices were used to estimate the ages of globular clusters in the halo of m104 .",
    "figure  [ f_heldf2 ] shows the distribution of clusters in the diagram using h@xmath1 against mg2 .",
    "most globular clusters in m104 appear consistent with an old age , comparable to that of milky way globular clusters .",
    "the clusters in the halo of m104 appear to be coeval with the clusters in the inner ( bulge ) regions studied by @xcite .",

    "the clusters on the e side have @xmath22 km s@xmath21  with a velocity dispersion @xmath23 km s@xmath21 . on the w side , the velocity dispersion is @xmath24 km s@xmath21  and the mean radial velocity 1052 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the velocity distribution is non - gaussian on the e side due to the presence of a distinct group of clusters with radial velocities @xmath25 km s@xmath21 .",
    "given the large scatter of the velocity measurements , the evidence for rotation is marginal .",
    "a linear fit including all data points gives a small difference for the mean cluster velocities on the e and w sides , indicating a very shallow rotation curve , @xmath26 km s@xmath21 kpc@xmath21 . with the present data ,",
    "no difference is obvious between the kinematics of metal - rich and metal - poor clusters .",
    "a larger sample of precise radial velocities will be necessary to establish the presence of rotation for the m104 halo clusters , and further observations are planned to this aim .",
    "figure  [ f_heldf3 ] also shows ( right panel ) the spatial distribution of clusters with approaching and receding velocity .",
    "this distribution might suggest that the kinematic axis is inclined with respect to the photometric minor axis .",
    "the metallicities derived from spectroscopy of globular clusters in the bulge and halo of m104 confirm a bimodal [ fe / h ] distribution , in agreement with the results from photometry ( @xcite ; moretti et al .",
    "2002 , this volume ) and with the spectroscopic results for the inner cluster sample @xcite .",
    "a two - gaussian fit to the distribution has two peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath27 and [ fe / h]@xmath28 , very similar to those of globular clusters in our galaxy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance distribution indicates that out to 15 kpc , the metal - rich clusters are 4 times more abundant than the metal - poor ones .",
    "a plot of globular cluster metallicities against the distance from the center shows that metal - rich clusters are more numerous near the galaxy center .",
    "this radial gradient has been mostly interpreted as caused by a changing mix of two ( metal - rich and metal - poor ) cluster populations .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ f_heldf4 ] suggests that the global [ fe / h ] distribution is produced by superposition of cluster populations whose properties vary in a complex way as a function of distance from the galaxy center .",
    "bimodality seems to be an ( over)simplified description of the metallicity distribution of globular clusters in m104  reality is probably more complex than we thought in this and many other galaxies ."
