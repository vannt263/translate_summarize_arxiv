    "this review focuses specifically on what we have learned about the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( cc  sne ) by examining images of the supernova ( sn ) sites taken prior to the explosion . by registering pre - sn and post - sn images , usually taken at high resolution using either space - based optical detectors , or ground - based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics systems ( lgs - ao ) , about one dozen cc sn progenitors have now been directly detected ( i.e. , shown to be spatially coincident with the sn ) in pre - sn images , with roughly two dozen upper limits derived from non - detections @xcite .",
    "this field has come a long way in the last decade , and promises to advance rapidly as more and more nearby galaxies  hosts of future cc sne  have high - resolution images added to the archive .",
    "this review is organized as follows . following a brief summary of sn classification and stellar evolution theory (   2 ) , one example from each of the following three categories of progenitor studies",
    "is provided (   3 ; ordered from most - to - least common ) : ( 1 ) no progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) ; ( 2 ) likely progenitor star identified via spatial coincidence in pre - sn and post - sn images ; ( 3 ) progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) and subsequently confirmed by demonstrating its absence in images taken after the sn has faded beyond detection . a summary of overall results to date for each sn type",
    "is then given (   4 ) , followed by a brief discussion of outstanding questions and areas in which future progress is likely (   5 ) .",
    "note that discussion is limited to what the examination of images of sn sites taken prior to the explosion has taught us , and necessarily excludes ( or relegates to very brief comment ) such related investigations as sn environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by elias rosa in this volume ) and sn progenitor `` forensics '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by modjaz in this volume ) . for a comprehensive discussion of all such related areas ,",
    "see the recent review by @xcite .",
    "it is typical to subdivide cc  sne into at least five major categories ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) : ii - plateau ( ii - p ; hydrogen in spectrum and plateau in optical light curve ) , ii - linear ( ii - l ; hydrogen in spectrum , no plateau in optical light curve ) , iin ( hydrogen in spectrum and spectral and photometric evidence for interaction between sn ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium [ csm ] ) , iib ( hydrogen in spectrum initially , but transforms into a hydrogen - deficient spectrum at later times ) , and ib / c ( no evidence for hydrogen in spectrum at any time ) , where the ordering is a roughly increasing one in terms of inferred degree of envelope stripping prior to explosion ( i.e. , ii - p are the least stripped at the time of explosion , and ib / c are the most stripped ) .",
    "while most of this review focuses on the observational advances that have been made , theoretical input is critical to translate observed progenitor luminosity ( or limits ) into zero - age - main - sequence masses ( @xmath0 ) and stellar evolutionary states . among the most complete ( and accessiblestars . ] ) stellar evolution models at present are the metallicity - dependent models produced with the cambridge stellar evolution code , stars , the descendant of the code developed originally by @xcite and updated most recently by @xcite ( 2004 ; see also @xcite , and references therein ) , since they follow stellar evolution up to the initiation of core neon burning , which is likely to give an accurate indication of the pre - sn luminosity .",
    "the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) of the stars evolutionary tracks are shown in figure  1 for stars ranging in initial mass from @xmath1 .",
    "comparison with other contemporary model grids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) show that the endpoints for stars in the @xmath2 range differ by at most @xmath3 dex in luminosity among the codes @xcite , which gives some assurance that systematic uncertainties are not great , at least at the low - mass end for red supergiant ( rsg ) stars .",
    "two areas of uncertainty in need of better quantification ( or , at least , agreement within the community ) include the effects that stellar rotation and mass - loss might have on the observable characteristics of stars prior to core collapse .",
    "not surprisingly , when no progenitor star is actually detected at the sn location in pre - sn images , only an upper limit to the progenitor s luminosity and , hence , mass , can be derived . to illustrate the analysis process in such a situation , i consider sn  2006my , an sn",
    "ii - p that exploded in a galaxy @xmath4 mpc away ( nearly all sne with progenitor studies are within @xmath5 mpc , since source confusion becomes an increasing problem with distance ) .",
    "details for this particular event are provided by @xcite ; here i briefly outline the steps my colleagues and i took to derive an upper mass limit on its progenitor .    the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) imaged the site of sn  2006my using the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in 1994 ( pre - sn ) and again in 2007 ( shortly after explosion ) .",
    "we registered the two images and pinpointed the sn location to better than 30 milli - arcsec in the pre - sn frame ( figure 2a , b ) .",
    "such fine registration allowed us to rule out a nearby point source ( source ` 1 ' in figure 2a ) as the progenitor star with greater than @xmath6 confidence .",
    "( note that this source had been previously identified by @xcite as the likely progenitor based on registration with lower - resolution ground - based optical post - sn images . )",
    "we next set an @xmath7-band detection limit in the pre - sn frame by placing artificial stars of progressively fainter magnitude at the sn location and letting the photometry software ( in this case , hstphot , see @xcite ) attempt to detect them .",
    "the point at which the software no longer detected a point source then serves as the limiting upper magnitude for the progenitor star .    to translate this single - filter detection limit into a luminosity , we assumed that the progenitor was a rsg ( given other sn  ii - p progenitor detections this seems a reasonable assumption ; see  3.2 and  4 ) , and then determined the greatest bolometric magnitude it could have had while still remaining below our detection threshold .",
    "this is accomplished through :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the distance modulus of the host galaxy ( ngc 4651 ) , @xmath10 the extinction to sn  2006my , @xmath7 the @xmath7-band detection threshold , @xmath11 the color range of rsg stars ( i.e. , spectral types @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 the bolometric correction corresponding to each @xmath14 . upon adopting the most conservative values for each of the parameters ( i.e. , the ones that produce the least restrictive @xmath15 for the progenitor s upper luminosity limit ) , and allowing for a maximum systematic uncertainty of 0.2 dex in the theoretical stellar model endpoints ( see   2 ) , the limiting bolometric magnitude above which any rsg would have been detected in our pre - sn image , @xmath15 , is derived .",
    "we then compared this with the final luminosity of stars with @xmath16 predicted by the stars stellar evolution models ( figure 2c ) to derive an upper bound on the progenitor mass of @xmath17 . from this analysis , then , we conclude that any rsg progenitor with an initial mass greater than @xmath18 would have been detected using our analysis procedure .    analyses similar to that described here for sn  2006my have been carried out on each of 22 non - detections in pre - sn images @xcite . as we shall see (   4 ) , it is the sheer number of such progenitor non - detections that permits rather strong conclusions to be drawn about cc sn progenitors from this category of progenitor studies .",
    "next , we consider the individually more revealing situation where an object coincident with the transformed sn location is actually detected in the pre - sn image(s ) , a situation that exists now for 11 cc sne @xcite . as an outstanding example of the analytic power provided by having multi - filter pre - sn images available ( especially in the near infrared for rsg progenitors ) , we consider the recent work of @xcite on sn  2008bk , a very nearby ( @xmath19 mpc ) sn  ii - p . in this case ,",
    "pre - sn ground - based images in @xmath20 were registered with post - sn lgs - ao @xmath21-band images to yield solid progenitor star detections in @xmath22 , and upper luminosity limits in @xmath23 and @xmath24 . when compared with the known spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of rsg , a good match for the progenitor of sn  2008bk",
    "is found with a progenitor of spectral type m4i ( figure  3 ) . from comparison with the stars stellar evolutionary models an initial progenitor mass of @xmath25",
    "is derived for this sn .",
    "similar studies on seven other detected sn  ii - p progenitors have found stars consistent with rsg in all cases , providing nice agreement between theory and observation . as we shall see in   4 , however , the _ range _ of masses inferred for these rsg progenitors is somewhat unexpected .",
    "finally , we consider the most satisfying situation where images taken before , during , and long after the sn explosion exist that clearly show the progenitor star , the sn , and the absence of the progenitor star , respectively .",
    "such a sequence provides nearly conclusive proof of the progenitor star s identity .",
    "currently , such a time series exists for only two objects : sn  1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sn  2005gl @xcite .",
    "because the case of sn  1987a is well - known , i present sn  2005gl as the example of this situation ; it also clearly demonstrates the investigative power provided by having a third observation , long after the sn has dropped below detection .",
    "as shown by @xcite , early spectra of sn  2005gl exhibited the classic features of a type iin event , showing narrow but resolved lines of hydrogen superposed on an intermediate - width component on an otherwise featureless continuum .",
    "analysis of the spectral features indicate ejecta interacting with a dense csm , whose properties suggest that the progenitor star exploded shortly after an lbv - like mass - loss episode . comparison of a pre - sn _ hst _ image with a post - sn image obtained from the ground using the lgs - ao at the keck ii telescope established a spatial coincidence between the sn and a very bright source possessing an estimated luminosity of over @xmath26 ( @xcite ; see figures  4a and 4b ) .",
    "the only single stars known to possess such an extraordinary luminosity are very massive ( @xmath27 ; see figure  1 ) , which conventional theory predicts should explode only after the lbv phase has ended @xcite .",
    "initially , strong claims for the unexpectedly luminous progenitor / sn  2005gl association had to be tempered by consideration of the distance of sn  2005gl s host galaxy . at over 60 mpc away , the @xmath28 resolution of the pre - sn _ hst _ image corresponds to @xmath5 pc , which raises suspicion that the object could be , e.g. , an unresolved stellar cluster or association of several massive stars , with only part of the light coming from the actual progenitor of sn  2005gl @xcite .",
    "additional observations , therefore , were clearly needed to settle the case , and two years later , an additional _ hst _ observation was made .",
    "this observation demonstrates that the luminous source in the pre - sn image has , indeed , disappeared ( figure  4c ) , which implies that the progenitor of sn  2005gl was a single , extremely luminous , star that exploded while in the lbv phase @xcite .",
    "such a luminosity is indicative of having had an initial mass of @xmath29 , which likely left behind a stellar mass black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to exploding during an unexpected evolutionary phase , the very fact _ that _ such a massive star is demonstrated to have exploded at all  as opposed to directly collapsing to a black hole with no sn explosion  is important , since the optical signature produced at the time of stellar collapse to a black hole is , at present , virtually unconstrained by either observation or theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the three examples discussed in   3 serve to illustrate how the science of seeking progenitors in pre - sn images is carried out , and what conclusions can typically be drawn .",
    "i now briefly summarize results to date arising from direct progenitor searches in pre - sn images ; for a more comprehensive review , see @xcite .",
    "* type ii - plateau : * sne  ii - p are by far the most well - defined category of cc sne in terms of direct observational progenitor constraints , having had eight putative progenitor detections made and 12 upper luminosity limits established .",
    "all of the available evidence suggests that rsg are the immediate progenitors of sne  ii - p . by employing a uniform reduction and analysis procedure ,",
    "@xcite has produced the cumulative frequency distribution shown in figure  5 for sne  ii - p , from which an intriguing result is immediately evident : all but one of the sne  ii - p have initial masses constrained to be @xmath30 , with the most massive _ detected _ progenitor of an sn  ii - p having a mass of only @xmath31 .",
    "this is surprising , since rsg up to @xmath32 are clearly observed in the local group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and would have easily been detected in the pre - sn images .",
    "this lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne ii - p lead @xcite to speculate that these massive rsg progenitors may be forming black holes heralded by faint , or non - existent , sn explosions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* type ii - linear : * a rare type of cc sn , it is perhaps not surprising that only one sn  ii - l ( sn  1980k ) has a pre - sn image , the analysis of which rules out massive rsg greater than about @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the stellar population of the type ii - l sn  1979c by @xcite determines a mass range of @xmath34 for its progenitor . at this point ,",
    "firm conclusions about the progenitors of sne  ii - l can not be made , although early indications are that at least some do not arise from extremely massive stars .",
    "* type iin : * sn  2005gl , described earlier in this review (   3.3 ) as having a very massive ( @xmath27 ) progenitor that exploded while in the lbv phase , is the only example of an sn  iin for which a progenitor has been detected in pre - sn images .",
    "whether such a massive progenitor is indicative of the class as a whole is not known .",
    "* type iib : * pre - sn images exist for two events .",
    "first , sn  1993j in m81 , where extensive analyses of pre - sn and post - sn images ( and spectra ) lead to the conclusion that a @xmath35 star exploded in a binary system , with a slightly less massive secondary surviving the explosion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "very recently , the type iib sn  2008ax has provided a great opportunity to further investigate this rare class of cc sne since pre - sn _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images exist in @xmath36 .",
    "a study by @xcite finds a curiously flat sed for the progenitor star , which is impossible to reconcile with a single rsg , but may be consistent with an early - type w - r ( wn class ) progenitor , suggesting a progenitor star with a large ( @xmath37 ) initial mass .",
    "* type ib / c : * a well - studied class , with ten upper limits but no detections from analysis of pre - sn images .",
    "the lack of detections is surprising , since it is commonly thought that at least some of the progenitors of sne  ib / c should be luminous , single w - r stars , in addition to others perhaps arising from lower mass stars in binary systems . while none of the non - detections definitively rule out a w - r progenitor",
    ", @xcite demonstrates that it is quite unlikely at this point that all sne  ib / c come from them .",
    "a summary of the current state of affairs of cc sn progenitor research via studies of pre - sn images is provided by figure  6 .",
    "the science of seeking sn progenitors has made tremendous strides in just the last ten years . for the future ,",
    "i look with particular interest at the extremes as areas ripe for breakthrough discoveries , since it is there that many of our most fundamental questions lie . on the low - mass end , how will the lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne  ii - p be resolved ?",
    "are we seeing the first glimpse of the mass cutoff for direct collapse to black holes ?",
    "if so , then how will this be reconciled with the _ very _ massive stars ( i.e. , the other mass extreme ) that apparently do explode as sne  iin or possibly iib ? and finally , how does binarity influence all of these conclusions ?",
    "clearly , we are just at the beginning stages of this exciting field of research , and great advances will no doubt be made in the coming decade .",
    "i thank the scientific organizing committee of the `` hot and cool : bridging gaps in massive star evolution '' conference for inviting me to provide this review .",
    "i thank seppo mattila for permitting reproduction of a figure from a recent paper , and stephen smartt for allowing the use of figures in advance of publication of his annual reviews article on the topic ."
