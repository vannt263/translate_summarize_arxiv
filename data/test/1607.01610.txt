    "the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is of prime importance for the investigation of nuclear structure  @xcite , heavy - ion reaction dynamics  @xcite , and many issues in astrophysics  @xcite .",

    "different models and approaches can produce rather different high - density behaviors  @xcite , while the complexity arises for the eos of asymmetric matter when the phase transitions , such as hyperon productions , meson condensations , and quark deconfinement , take place at high densities .",
    "normally , phase transitions can soften the eos and reduce the neutron star ( ns ) maximum mass significantly .",
    "recently , massive ns s , for instance , the pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 with @xmath0  @xcite , and psr j0348 + 0432 , with @xmath1  @xcite were identified with the high - precision measurements .",
    "the larger ns mass means the stiffer eos of ns matter at high densities .",
    "considering the phase transitions in the ns core and the eos constraint from the collective flow data at high densities , it is difficult for the nuclear models to reproduce ns s as massive as @xmath2 .",
    "this indeed proposes a challenge to the nuclear eos at supra - normal densities .",
    "one may doubt whether there are new degrees of freedom besides nucleons in ns s  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one may contemplate what interactions can allow the new degrees of freedom in massive nss@xcite .",
    "the mixture of low - density hadronic matter and high - density quark matter may form in the ns core after the hadron - quark transition occurs with the increase of density . in order to evade the potential confliction between the softened eos due to the appearance of the quark phase and the observed massive ns s , it is necessary to stiffen the quark eos , for instance , by considering the strong coupling and/or color superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new repulsion , provided by the u - boson , was introduced for nucleons in ns s",
    "the light u - boson , first proposed by fayet  @xcite , might be regarded as the mediator of the putative fifth force  @xcite .",
    "recently , this light u - boson has been considered as the interaction mediator of the mev dark matter to account for the bright 511 kev @xmath3-ray from the galactic bulge  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the u - boson with the nucleons is very weak , but can increase appreciably the ns maximum mass  @xcite and influence the transition density at the inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust , effectively  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the weak coupling to baryons plays a striking role in stabilizing neutron stars in the presence of the super - soft symmetry energy  @xcite that is extracted from the fopi / gsi data on the @xmath4 ratio in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .    in this work",

    "in the rmf models we adopted in this work , the nucleon - nucleon interaction is realized via the exchange of three mesons : the isoscalar meson @xmath5 , which provides the intermediate - range attraction between the nucleons , the isoscalar - vector meson @xmath6 , which offers the short - range repulsion , and the isovector - vector meson @xmath7 , which accounts for the isospin dependence of the nuclear force .",
    "though the @xmath8 meson interacts strongly with nucleons , we do not include it here because the rmf framework just has the hartree term that gives a zero contribution of the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the @xmath8 mesons can be included in the relativistic hartree - fock approximation . without the exchange terms ,",
    "the rmf approximation still works well due mainly to the fact that in the relativistic framework the fermions are already identified by the dirac equation that is specifically for fermions .",
    "moreover , the interaction in the rmf approximation , built upon the equilibrium between the intermediate - range attraction and the short - range repulsion , can yield the saturation properties of nuclear matter very well  @xcite .",

    "however , the maxwell construction does not have the mixed phase . in the maxwell construction , a direct transition from hadronic to quark matter is accompanied by a density jump and both phases are separately charge neutral . regardless of the charge chemical equilibrium ,",
    "only a single ( baryon ) chemical potential is common to the hadronic and quark phases with a constant pressure . to avoid the motion of charge due to the different charge chemical potentials in two phases in the maxwell construction , a more realistic equation of state",
    "can be obtained from the wigner - seitz cell calculation by taking into account the coulomb and surface effects .",

    "it is striking to see that the stiff eos with the nl3 , which is not favored by the constraint from the flow data of the heavy - ion reactions  @xcite , even becomes much softer than the soft fsugold eos due to the hadron - quark transition . with the inclusion of the u - boson ,",
    "the soft eos is stiffened greatly . because the eos of hybrid star matter initiated with the nl3 is now much softer than that with the fsugold , the stiffening effect turns out to be much more appreciable for the eos initiated with the nl3 .",
    "the similar stiffening role of the u - boson can also be clearly seen in the case without phase transition , as we compare curves with the nl3 and fsugold .",
    "since the softening of the eos due to the hadron - quark phase transition reduces largely the maximum mass of ns s , we will see below that the inclusion of the u - boson plays an important role in satisfying the maximum mass constraint for ns s .    .",

    "[ eospt ] , the eos of hybrid star matter is stiffened significantly due to the repulsion provided by the u - boson .",
    "we see that the eos with the soft ( fsugold ) and stiff ( nl3 ) hadron phase models acquires similar stiffening especially for the case with the fixed bag constant .",
    "this is different from the case in pure hadronic matter where a much more significant stiffening effect is produced by the soft model  @xcite . while for the case with the fixed transition density , the stiffening role of u - boson is more significant for the stiff parameter set nl3 .",
    "the reason for these to occur lies in the following facts . in pure hadronic matter with rmf models",
    ", there is the cancelation between the repulsion provided by the vector meson and the attraction provided by the scalar meson .",
    "thus , more significant cancelation in the soft model sharpens the importance of the repulsion provided by the u - boson . while quarks are modeled by the mit bag model with the same bag constant , the repulsion provided by the u - boson plays the same stiffening role in the quark phase eos , after the hadron - quark phase transition occurs . in the case with the fixed transition density ,",
    "the quark phase eos connected to the hadronic phase with the nl3 is softer than that with the fsugold , because of the larger bag constant .",
    "meanwhile , due to the phase equilibrium in the mixed phase , the eos initiated with the nl3 is softer than that with the fsugold with increasing the density .",

    "this is understandable , because the different bag constants are used to obtain the same transition density .",
    "however , compared to the large difference in the eos s in pure hadronic matter , as shown in fig .",

    "compared to the evolution of eos s with the nl3 and fsugold , we see that the stiffer eos undergoes a more appreciable softening of the eos in the mixed phase , as the quark phase is given by the same mit bag model either with the fixed bag constant or with a given transition density .",

    "it is also interesting to examine the effect of the u - boson on the ns structure , although the inclusion of the u - boson does not change the chemical and mechanical equilibriums , the transition densities , and the extents of each phases as well . as an example , here we examine the size of the quark core and of the mixed phase for the maximum mass configuration with the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath98 . with the inclusion of the u - boson , the ns maximum mass increases from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "it is found in the ns with the maximum mass configuration that the radius of pure quark core is 5.3 km , which is smaller than 5.76 km obtained without the inclusion of the u - boson .",
    "the shell of the mixed phase extends from 5.3 to 8.6 km , while without the inclusion of the u - boson , the shell starts from 5.76 to 7.6 km .",
    "these results indicate that the u - boson may change the ratio of various phases in the particular ns though it does not take part in the phase transition .    .",
    "the dotted curve is the result with the density - dependent coupling constant of the u - boson , depicted in the inset . to obtain the density - dependent coupling ,",
    "the mass of the u - boson is taken as @xmath101 .",
    "[ gudd],width=302,height=302 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ mr ] , the ns radius is significantly increased by the u - boson . it was pointed out in the literature  @xcite that the ns radius is primarily determined by the eos in the lower density region of @xmath102 to @xmath66 . since the inclusion of the u - boson also increases the pressure in the lower density region appreciably , a large extent of the ns radius is obtained accordingly with various @xmath103 s of interest .",
    "this is similar to the previous works in ref .",
    "it is known that the extraction of ns radii from observations still suffers from large systematic uncertainties  @xcite involved in the distance measurements and theoretical analyses of the light spectrum  @xcite .",
    "there is yet no consensus on the extracted ns radii to date .",
    "for instance , using the thermal spectra from quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) guillot and collaborators extracted ns radii of @xmath104 km  @xcite , while a relevant study of spectroscopic radius measurements also suggest small radii @xmath105 km for a 1.5 @xmath106 ns  @xcite .",
    "there are also larger extracted radii : a 3-@xmath17 lower limit of 11.1 km on the radius of the psr j0437 - 4715  @xcite and a lower limit of 13 km for 4u 1608 - 52  @xcite .",
    "if the small radii of ns s is established , we need to reconsider the large ns radii produced by the u - boson .",
    "a possible solution of the ns radius suppression is to invoke the appropriate in - medium effects  @xcite . considering that the ns radii are mainly determined by the low - density eos , it is possible to reduce the ns radii by constructing the density - dependent coupling constant for the u - boson in the low - density regime . in the high - density regime ,",
    "we neglect the in - medium effect for the u - boson , as one knows that the in - medium effect at high densities is suppressed greatly by the pauli blocking  @xcite . as an example",
    ", we perform the calculation with the eos whose hadron phase part is obtained with the fsugold and find that the appropriate density - dependent coupling constant of the u - boson can reduce the ns radii significantly , as shown in fig .  [ gudd ] .",
    "the density - dependent coupling constant , depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ gudd ] , is designed to little change the pressure in the low - density regime  @xcite .",
    "while the energy density still acquires a significant increase from the u - boson , the resulting ns radius is even less than the one obtained with the pure hadron phase eos .",
    "since the ns maximum mass is determined mainly by the high - density eos , the present form of the density dependence just gives rise to a moderate reduction of the ns maximum mass .",
    "stars , the u - boson is also needed with the parameter denoted in the legend . [ fmr2],width=340,height=302 ]    in figs .",
    "[ mr ] and [ gudd ] , we have not included the contribution of the qcd correction .",
    "the influence of the qcd correction on the ns maximum mass is rather sensitive to the transition density . given large transition densities , the qcd correction just plays limited role in enhancing the ns maximum mass , since the maximum mass in this case is dominated by the hadron phase eos . as the transition density decreases , the qcd correction brings more significant enhancement for the ns maximum mass .",
    "this findings are consistent with those in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as we fix the bag constant , the situation for the qcd correction is different because the transition density itself in this case is increased by the correction through the phase equilibrium conditions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fmr2 ] , the qcd correction with the fixed bag constant gives rise to a significant enhancement of the ns maximum mass , which is mainly attributed to the appreciable rise of the transition density . in this case , since the hadron phase eos with the nl3 is much stiffer than that with the fsugold , the large transition density due to the qcd correction leads to a more appreciable enhancement of the ns maximum mass with the nl3 . with the inclusion of the u - boson ,",
    "the ns maximum mass can further increase to satisfy the @xmath2 constraint  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that we just need a smaller ratio parameter of the u - boson to meet the maximum mass constraint in this case .",
    "this is more apparent for the eos with the stiff nl3 : the ratio parameter is largely reduced by the qcd correction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fmr2 ]    since the magnitude and in - medium behavior of the u - boson ratio parameter are important for the ns properties , it remains significant to discuss the parameters for the u - boson . to satisfy the ns maximum mass constraint ,",
    "the ratio parameter @xmath103 in this work is estimated to be around @xmath107 , depending on the hadron phase models chosen . to avoid the violation of the low - energy nuclear constraints for finite nuclei",
    ", we may limit the weak interaction strength of the u - boson with the mass being of order @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath108 is 0.01 , then the mass of the u - boson would be below @xmath109 , responsible for a long - range interaction .",
    "the weak interaction strength of the u - boson does not compromise the success of nuclear models in reproducing the properties of finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the inclusion of the qcd correction may reduce the ratio parameter significantly .",
    "we note that these estimated orders of magnitude for the u - boson parameters can be compatible with parameter regions allowed by a few experimental constraints  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the density - dependent parameter of the u - boson is found to be consistent with the usual predictions on the ns radius , while the density dependence would originate from the in - medium effect in the nuclear many - body system  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the hadron - quark phase transition using the gibbs conditions with the rmf models for hadron phase and mit bag model for quark phase .",
    "we have considered the u - boson to stiffen the eos of hybrid matter that is softened greatly by the phase transition . with the inclusion of the u - boson",
    ", the hybrid eos is appreciably stiffened , and the stiffening extent is similar in the eos s with stiff and soft hadron phase models due to the fact that the same mit model is used for the quark phase . as a result , the ns maximum mass is significantly increased by the u - boson .",
    "in addition , we have investigated the effect of the effective qcd correction on the hybrid eos .",
    "this correction may give rise to the stiffening of the hybrid eos and the increase of the ns maximum mass that is significant as the transition density is not very high .",
    "the effective qcd correction can reduce the coupling strength of the u - boson that is needed to satisfy ns maximum mass constraint . while the inclusion of the u - boson also increases the ns radius significantly , we find that appropriate density dependence of the u - boson coupling constant may bring the ns radius down to the regime consistent with the observations and other model predictions .",
    "we have also discussed that with the weak interaction strength the inclusion of the u - boson does not compromise the success of conventional nuclear models in reproducing properties of finite nuclei . in summary",
    ", the inclusion of the u - boson can favorably allow the existence of quark degrees of freedom in the ns interior that is declined by the large mass ns observations .",
    "on the other hand , the future coincident measurements and more precise extraction of the mass and radius of neutron stars may also bring the constraint for the u - boson that is yet to be detected in the terrestrial laboratory .",
