    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are mostly galactic objects that emit short bursts of x - ray and gamma radiation at irregular intervals . at times these sources emit exceptionally energetic flares that last hundreds of seconds , with peak luminosities of up to @xmath2erg s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the most luminous sgr flare observed to date was recorded on 27 december 2004 , and originated from sgr 1806@xmath120 @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were observed at late times in the lightcurve tail by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) @xcite and the ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) @xcite satellites , most notably at @xmath4hz and @xmath5hz @xcite . although the exact timing of the qpo signals is unclear",
    "since the peak flare saturated both detectors , the signals can be unambiguously observed beginning approximately @xmath6s after the initial flare @xcite .    the @xmath7s period of the lightcurve tail observed during the december 2004 hyperflare @xcite , as well as the phase - dependence of the qpo features , suggests that the parent object might be a type of slowly rotating neutron star .",
    "in this model the phase dependence can be interpreted as localization to a specific region of the star s surface , and the observed frequencies may be related to particular seismic modes @xcite , making qpos an interesting probe of the astroseismology of sgrs . in particular ,",
    "if qpos are indeed related to seismic vibrations of a neutron star , then we can estimate the thickness of the star s crust , and possibly infer what type of material makes up the star s interior @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that changes in the observed qpos over time may be indicative of physical changes in the source , such as a decaying magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the magnetar model @xcite proposes that sgrs are a type of highly magnetized ns with a surface magnetic field in excess of @xmath8 g . in this model qpos",
    "can be explained by a starquake event , in which the star s magnetic field becomes twisted and then violently rearranges , exciting crustal or global seismic modes and releasing gamma ray bursts with the observed qpo structures @xcite .",
    "numerical studies in which the magnetar is treated as a coupled system consisting of an elastic crust and a magnetohydrodynamic fluid core have demonstrated a number of interesting effects .",
    "these include the dynamical generation of instabilities and asymmetric quasi - equilibria in the magnetic field @xcite , as well as a coupling between discrete crustal modes and continuous bands of global alfvn modes , with qpos appearing in the late time starquake oscillations near the edges of the alfvn spectral bands @xcite .",
    "this numerical work also suggests that some qpos may be exceptionally strong because they are close in frequency to one of the crustal modes @xcite .",
    "the same dynamics may also drive the emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) by exciting the magnetar s seismic modes ; in particular , crustal f - modes @xcite . although it is argued that at realistic values of the magnetic field strength f - modes are unlikely to be sufficiently excited to produce an observable signal in second - generation gravitational wave detectors @xcite , zink et al .",
    "note that low - frequency modes up to 100 hz remain unstudied , and may be sufficiently excited to produce detectable gw signals @xcite .",
    "a number of searches for gravitational radiation associated with sgrs and magnetars have been conducted . in particular , a search for gws associated with f - mode ringdowns in six magnetars targeting the frequency ranges @xmath9khz , @xmath10hz , and @xmath11hz , with time windows of @xmath12ms , found no evidence of a gw signal @xcite .",
    "other searches targeting short - duration ( @xmath13s ) gws from sgrs @xcite as well as stacked gw emissions associated with the sgr 1900@xmath1414 storm event @xcite also found no evidence of gws associated with sgr bursts at energies accessible by past interferometric gravitational wave detectors .",
    "our work extends a search algorithm developed by matone and mrka @xcite , targeting narrow - band , long - duration gw signals associated with sgr qpos .",
    "this algorithm is based on an excess energy method and thus does not presume any particular waveform for the emitted gw signal .",
    "in addition , the algorithm also does not require exact knowledge of the timing of the gw signal relative to the electromagnetic trigger ; we choose conservative @xmath0 long time windows encompassing the entire flare event .",
    "the algorithm was previously applied to ligo data recorded during the december 2004 sgr 1806@xmath120 hyperflare event to constrain the energetics of any associated gw signal , and set a lowest bound of @xmath15erg on the total gw emissions associated with the qpo at @xmath4hz @xcite . a similar algorithm targeting long - duration gw transients using a complementary cross - power technique",
    "is discussed in @xcite , and is also relevant to searches for gws from sgrs in the ligo data .",
    "the ligo network of interferometric gravitational wave detectors has completed 6 science runs to date .",
    "science runs 5 and 6 lasted from november 4th , 2005 to september 30th , 2007 , and from july 7th , 2009 to october 20th , 2010 , respectively . during s5 alone",
    "@xmath16 em flares originating from sgr 1806@xmath120 were observed .",
    "if sgr flares are indeed coupled to seismic vibrations of a neutron star as suggested by the magnetar model , one might expect that each burst should excite the same , characteristic frequencies of the star s crust regardless of the luminosity of the flare , leading to repeated gw emissions at the same frequencies . as a result , a comprehensive algorithm analyzing all triggers and qpo frequencies overlapping with the ligo data set for evidence of repeated gw emissions from sgr flares might prove itself more sensitive than an algorithm targeting a single burst or qpo frequency .",
    "although we illustrate the concept through a @xmath17hz frequency band centered on the @xmath4hz qpo observed during the december 2004 sgr 1806@xmath120 hyperflare , the algorithm can be applied to any frequency window of interest , allowing the method to target each of the observed qpo frequencies .",
    "the algorithm concept presented has been designed to efficiently process large , multi - detector data sets containing multiple sgr flares from a single source , and includes a number of data quality measures intended to account for nonstationarity and deviations from gaussianity in the data stream of a physical detector operating for months or years .",
    "the method , like the methods mentioned above , benefits from knowledge of the arrival time of an electromagnetic counterpart to the hypothesized gw signal , as well as knowledge of the sky position of the source .",
    "in addition , we further assume that the recurrent sgr bursts contain the same qpo structures and seismic modes observed in hyperflares , and introduce a new detection criterion based on the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test and fisher s method , allowing us to increase the sensitivity of the algorithm relative to analyzing a single event .",
    "we also discuss the problem of variable detector orientation for each trigger , and discuss how to optimize the concept accordingly .",
    "we show that with the proper data conditioning procedures the behaviour of real data can be modeled well mathematically and approximated numerically through gaussian statistics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : data ] we present a concept study of the off - source detector background and orientation using playground data segments from ligo s fifth science run @xcite .",
    "the time domain algorithm splits the data stream by bandpass filtering into three channels of a specific bandwidth motivated by x - ray observation constraints @xmath18 : the qpo channel , which is centered on the qpo frequency , and the @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels , centered at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath18 for example can be derived from the measured full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the qpos observed in the em ( x - ray ) emissions.20 hyperflare a table summarizing the frequencies and fwhms of the observed qpos can be found in @xcite . if assuming , based on the magnetar model , that the qpo frequencies and bandwidths are the same as the f - modes of the neutron star , these can also be the frequencies and bandwidths of the gravitational radiation @xcite .",

    "[ subsec : dq ] .",
    "] defining the excess energy in this manner allows us to isolate the contribution of a gw signal associated with the qpo to the total energy of the data stream while simultaneously suppressing broadband instrumental noise .",
    "it is also necessary to account for temporal non - stationarity in the data stream since we perform a comprehensive analysis with data spanning several years , during which changes in the properties of the detector noise are too significant to be ignored .",
    "we accomplish this by computing the excess energy in the time interval @xmath28 , the excess energy in the time interval @xmath29 , and then computing the difference in excess energy @xmath30 resulting in a quantity which can be compared directly across different times . for on - source measurements",

    "a number of measures have been implemented to account for instrumental transients and the variability in data quality across long stretches of time .",
    "we rely primarily on three techniques : ( i ) the application of data quality flags , ( ii ) transient glitch rejection , and ( iii ) the use of a locally - determined weighting factor @xmath27 to measure the excess energy ( defined by ) .    1 .",
    "data quality flags are constructed by the lsc s detector characterization working group to characterize noise contamination in the detector s data stream , and mark the times of known environmental noise sources and detector calibration issues .",
    "the flags are divided into categories 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 based on severity and duration .",
    "here we reject any data marked with a flag designated category 1  times when the detector was not taking data in the design configuration  or category 2  times when well - understood instrumental glitches were observed .",
    "we also avoid standard and significant line features while selecting the frequency bands , and we propose to apply lock - in filtering techniques to mitigate the effects of any potentially unavoidable line features .",
    "detailed descriptions of the flags can be found in @xcite .",
    "2 .   transient glitch rejection provides a second method for reducing noise contamination . since we expect a long - duration signal lasting hundreds of seconds we can safely reject transient glitches over much smaller time scales .",
    "this is accomplished using a method similar to the glitch veto algorithm discussed in @xcite : we divide the data stream of each , filtered channel into tiles of length @xmath65 , typically of order @xmath66s or less , compute distributions of the energy per tile for each of the three channels , and recursively veto any tiles with energy more than @xmath67 standard deviations from the mean tile energy .",
    "we then divide each channel by a duty factor @xmath68 to renormalize the remaining data in this example .",
    "the veto is applied to the strain time series of each filtered channel independently since glitches are not generally distributed evenly in frequency space .",
    "this process is iterated until either all outliers have been removed or the fraction of data vetoed passes a cutoff value , typically chosen to be 10% , at which point the data segment is rejected as unreliable .",
    "another source of data contamination arises from the curvature of the ligo noise floor . naively choosing @xmath43 in the definition of the excess energy statistic results in a quantity that does not properly account for differences in the background noise across multiple frequency bands . since the properties of the detector noise change with time we are forced to calculate an appropriate value of @xmath27 for each measurement . , which shows a plot of @xmath27 calculated using ligo data . ] with this in mind we define a local weighting factor @xmath27 by averaging the four quantities @xmath69 calculated by summing the energies of each channel in the time interval @xmath70 $ ] for each of the four times @xmath71 .",

    "the measurement is centered about a time @xmath31 which is either the time of an observed sgr trigger or randomly sampled from the background data .",

    "these four values are averaged to estimate @xmath27 , and then @xmath50 is computed using this value in and . the part of the diagram corresponding to @xmath50 is divided into a solid region and a dashed region to emphasize that it is the difference in excess energy between these two regions which we ultimately calculate using the locally determined @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig : w_schematic],width=326 ] +   + we choose @xmath24 to be the same time interval used for computing excess energy measurements , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 to be the minimum adjacent times which ensure that none of the measurements overlap . with this scheme we can use the data immediately preceding and following the region used for a given @xmath50 measurement to determine the appropriate value of @xmath27 in .",
    "defined in this way , @xmath27 accounts for differences between channels due to the shape of the noise floor , as well as changes in the noise floor over time .",
    "in order to validate the concept and test the mathematical model of section [ sec : theory ] we simulate the result of applying the pipeline to a set of detected sgr 1806@xmath120 flares coinciding with the data from ligo s fifth science run ( s5 ) .",
    "this is accomplished by configuring the pipeline to perform a realistic study but replacing the ligo data stream with stretches of randomly generated gaussian white noise .",
    "this is not unreasonable as the data quality cut studies indicated that the  cleaned  data is very similar to a gaussian random set .",
    "we construct a background sampling distribution by calculating @xmath33 for simulated data consisting of 240 seconds of randomly generated gaussian white noise with strain spectral noise density @xmath75hz@xmath76 .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is chosen so that the simulated noise is similar in magnitude to the ligo noise floor during s5 . we choose @xmath78hz and @xmath79hz , corresponding to the frequency and fwhm of the strongest qpo signal observed in the lightcurve tail of the 27 december , 2004 sgr 1806@xmath120 hyperflare event , and @xmath80s @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath24 is shorter than the @xmath81s duration of the lightcurve tail observed during the sgr 1806@xmath120 hyperflare , nevertheless for the purposes of a concept study , is less computationally expensive while providing essentially the same insight .",
    "we also compute the theoretical pdf of the background distribution using the same parameters to compare the theoretical result to the simulation .    in anticipation of later work utilizing ligo data , we also construct a second background distribution incorporating a simulated veto step to demonstrate that our algorithm is robust with respect to the inclusion of data quality vetoes .",
    "this is accomplished by randomly removing 5% of the sampling points from the strain time series of each , filtered channel independently , and then applying a duty factor to each channel .",
    "we also obtain a fitted pdf by using nonlinear least squares regression to fit the theoretical cdf to the empirical cdf of the resulting background distribution .",

    "we choose to explore fisher s method over a coherent method for two main reasons : ( i ) fisher s method does not require us to assume any relationship between the waveforms observed in different detectors beyond the existence of excess energy in the qpo band , and ( ii ) a significant fraction of triggers will only be recorded by one detector because of downtime , and coherent methods are not applicable for these triggers .",
    "likewise , we can use fisher s method to define the sensitivity for the detector network .",
    "we obtain a set of antenna factors for a given detector by calculating the antenna response function at the time of each trigger in the dominant polarization frame ( dpf ) of that detector . for a single detector , this is the frame in which the detector response is entirely in the plus direction ( @xmath140 ) @xcite .",

    "[ fig : af]a shows the quantity @xmath57 for each trigger and for h1 and l1 separately . since the algorithm becomes more sensitive as the number of triggers increases , but is less sensitive if the detector is poorly aligned for some of the triggers , we expect that there is an optimal subset of the full list of triggers for which the sensitivity of a multi trigger approach is maximized .",

    "analytical results for the pdf and cdf of the detector background distribution enabled us to demonstrate that these expressions accurately describe the output of the pipeline applied to ( i ) gaussian white noise and ( ii ) off - source ligo s5 data from the 4-km hanford detector after reasonable data quality cuts . in turn",

    "it is important to note that a useful side product of the method might be the ability to identify distinct running condition of the gravitational wave detectors ( for a similar work in this topic , see @xcite ) .",
    "we also demonstrated how to combine the data streams of multiple , independent detectors into a single study on an alternative non - coherent way , and illustrated how to optimize the algorithm for a future search involving the s5 hanford - livingston data set . simulating the optimal trigger list and using gaussian white noise with strain spectral noise density @xmath147 resulted in an upper bound on the total energy emitted in isotropic gravitational radiation by sgr 1806@xmath120 in the 30 seconds following a flare of @xmath148 where @xmath62 is the detector - source distance .",
    "due to the uncertainties of currently available model predictions , throughout our study we assumed that ( i ) the central frequency , bandwidth , and time scale of a gravitational wave signal associated with an sgr qpo event can directly be taken from the electromagnetic observations of the qpo signal , ( ii ) the duration of the gravitational wave signals are the same for every qpo event of the same sgr source , and ( iii ) the duration of all the gravitational wave signals associated with the astrophysical triggers from an sgr source can be approximated with the duration of the longest flare event among the triggers ( e.g. in case of sgr 1806@xmath120 , it is the 27 december 2004 hyperflare event ) .",
    "these assumptions however might turn out to be too optimistic as theoretical model predictions become more sophisticated in the future .",
    "our method can be applied to any chosen central frequency , and can be generalized to a wide scale of bandwidths . however , a more detailed study is necessary to see the consequences of having different durations for the gravitational wave signals emitted during the different flare events of the same sgr source .",
