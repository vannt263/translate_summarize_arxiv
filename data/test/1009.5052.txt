    "recently there was much interest in rectification in nanoscale systems .",
    "@xcite nonlinear mesoscopic transport exhibits much interesting physics such as a peculiar magnetic field dependence of the current @xcite and negative differential resistance for the rectification current at low voltages.@xcite another motivation for the investigation of mesoscopic diode or ratchet @xcite effect comes from possible practical applications in nanoelectronics and energy conversion .",
    "following the pioneering paper by christen and bttiker @xcite most attention has focused on a simpler case of a fermi - liquid conductor . at the same time , the diode effect requires a combination of spacial asymmetry and strong electron interactions in the conductor .",
    "hence , one may expect a stronger ratchet current in strongly interacting luttinger liquid systems .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by a recent study of transport asymmetries in one - channel quantum wires.@xcite refs .",
    "have focused on a one - channel luttinger liquid in a linear conductor in the presence of a single asymmetric scatterer .",
    "this is the conceptually simplest situation giving rise to rectification . at the same time , changing geometry may increase asymmetry and hence the rectification current . in this paper",
    "we consider an asymmetric setup based on a y - junction of three quantum wires with three impurities .",
    "we show that a stronger diode effect can be achieved in such system than in a linear luttinger liquid and rectification is possible even in the case of symmetric point scatterers .",
    "we focus on the simplest one - channel y - junctions .",
    "more complicated luttinger liquid junctions , such as y - junctions of single - wall carbon nanotubes , are also of interest . in particular , it might be easier to make such junctions in a reproducible way .",
    "y - junctions are among basic elements of electric circuits , however , a theoretical investigation of luttinger liquid y - junctions@xcite has begun only during the last decade . by now , there is a good understanding of linear conductance near various fixed points as well as tunneling density of states.@xcite in this paper we extend the previous research to the problem of transport asymmetries .",
    "specifically , we consider a setup of the type shown in fig .",
    "we assume that one of the three terminals is kept at zero voltage .",
    "ac voltages with amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , are applied to the remaining two terminals . in a general case ,",
    "a dc - current is generated in each of the three wires in the junction , fig .",
    "1 . the three currents are different but can be computed in a similar way .",
    "we calculate such rectification dc currents for various types of y - junctions .",
    "we focus on the limit of a low - frequency ac voltage bias . in order to determine the amplitude of the rectification effect in that limit",
    ", it is sufficient to find the difference of the dc currents at the opposite dc bias voltages , i.e. , compare the current when the potentials at the terminals are time - independent and equal 0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the current when the potentials are 0 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "refs .  ) .",
    "this corresponds to a dc current generated by low - frequency square voltage waves .",
    "we find that in some classes of y - junctions the rectification current is higher than in a linear wire with the same strength of the repulsive electron interaction at the same voltage bias . in a certain interval of low voltages",
    "the rectification current exhibits a power - law dependence on the bias : @xmath7 .",
    "the exponent @xmath8 can be negative .",
    "clearly , such dependence with a negative exponent can not extend all the way to zero voltage as @xmath9 at @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the rectification current reaches a maximum at a certain voltage .",
    "we demonstrate that in junctions without time - reversal symmetry , the maximal rectification current can be comparable with the total current @xmath0 even for low voltages and modest interaction strength in the wires .",
    "in particular , such rectification current can be achieved in the `` island setup '' , illustrated in fig .  1 , which can be experimentally realized in quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "for comparison , in a linear wire , the rectification current @xcite is always much lower than @xmath11 .",
    "the diode effect in y - junctions is not as strong in the presence of time - reversal symmetry as in its absence . still , the maximal rectification current is higher than in a linear conductor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , after a brief qualitative discussion , we describe our setup and formulate a model .",
    "we then review the properties of y - junctions and derive a general expression for the rectification current .",
    "next , we apply the general formalism to the model of three weakly connected wires .",
    "then we determine the leading contributions to the rectification current at different interaction strengths and matching conditions at the junction .",
    "we discover several regimes with different voltage dependences of the current .",
    "finally , we discuss how to build a junction with the maximal rectification current .",
    "is applied to the first wire .",
    "wires 2 and 3 are connected to the ground .",
    "we calculate the dc current in wire 1 . one can view ab , cd and ef as edges of an integer quantum hall liquid .",
    "this corresponds to an `` island junction''.@xcite , width=192 ]    we consider a junction of @xmath12 one - channel wires . in the subsequent sections we will specialize to the case of @xmath13 and assume that the system is spin - polarized or , equivalently , that charge carriers are spinless fermions . in all cases",
    "we assume that long range coulomb interaction in the conductor is screened by the gates .",
    "in such situation the applied voltage bias affects not only the current but also the charge density in the system .",
    "rectification is possible , if a change of the voltage bias sign results in a change of not only the sign but also absolute value of the current .",
    "the latter obviously requires left - right asymmetry in the system .",
    "asymmetry may have two origins : asymmetry caused by the way how the bias is applied and geometric asymmetry due to , e.g. , an asymmetric scatterer.@xcite in particular , one can consider a situation in which several terminals are kept at zero electric potential and the potential of the other terminals changes between @xmath14 and @xmath5 .",
    "the charge density is different for the opposite voltage signs .",
    "this in turn affects the current and leads to rectification .",
    "such density - driven rectification is possible in a broad range of situations including systems without electron interaction in the presence of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it has been investigated in the context of a carbon nanotube junction in the noninteracting - electrons approximation in ref .  .",
    "at a high voltage bias a strong rectification effect was found . in this paper ,",
    "on the other hand , we focus on the low - voltage regime and , in particular , the universal behavior at low bias . in that limit the density - driven rectification effect",
    "is of little importance as it results in a small rectification current @xmath15 in a noninteracting system .",
    "besides , the density - driven rectification requires a specific way to apply bias . if we are interested , for example , in the transformation of incoming electromagnetic radiation into a dc current then clearly the potential oscillates in all terminals .",
    "thus , in this paper we focus on the rectification mechanism due to geometric asymmetry .",
    "y - junctions have a `` built - in '' geometric asymmetry .",
    "indeed , let us focus on the current @xmath16 in one of the three wires connected by the junction .",
    "the current @xmath17 equals the sum of the currents in the other two wires .",
    "thus , the same current enters the junction through two wires and leaves through one only .",
    "this means that the two sides of the junction are not equivalent since they correspond to 1 and 2 wires .",
    "thus , we may expect that geometric mechanism of rectification applies to any y - junction .",
    "however , as we demonstrate below , the geometric mechanism only works , if electron interaction is present or time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "indeed , let us consider a time - reversal invariant system of non - interacting spinless fermions in an @xmath12-terminal mesoscopic junction .",
    "we calculate the current between terminals @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we compare the current in the situation when terminals @xmath18 are kept at the voltage @xmath2 and terminals @xmath20 are kept at zero bias ( case 1 ) with the current in the situation when terminals @xmath21 are kept at zero bias and terminals @xmath19 are kept at the voltage @xmath2 ( case 2 ) . for non - interacting fermions",
    "the current reduces to the sum of the single particle contributions corresponding to each energy in the window @xmath22 .",
    "we thus compare such contributions for two opposite voltage biases .",
    "the wave function of an electron incoming from terminal @xmath23 with the momentum @xmath24 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the coordinate in wire number @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a unitary scattering matrix .",
    "the above notations for the wave function imply that the probability to find an electron with the wave function @xmath29 in wire number @xmath30 is determined by the outgoing wave and is proportional to @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the probability is determined by both the incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry implies that @xmath33 is also a solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the solution is made of @xmath12 incoming waves and one outgoing wave .",
    "it can be represented as a linear combination of waves @xmath34 with different @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the outgoing wave satisfies the equation @xmath35 .",
    "the absence of outgoing waves in the channels with numbers @xmath36 implies that @xmath37 .",
    "hence , @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "now we can compare the contributions to the current from particles with the energy @xmath40 for two opposite signs of the bias .",
    "electrons , incoming from different terminals , are not coherent . hence , in case 1 , @xmath41 . in case 2 , @xmath42 .",
    "the currents are equal from the symmetry of the scattering matrix and hence the diode effect is absent .        in the presence of electron interaction , the rectification effect becomes possible .",
    "this can be understood already from a simple model with two point scatterers of unequal strength in a linear wire ( fig .",
    "similar rectification mechanisms operate in more complex junctions of luttinger liquids .",
    "we will assume that long - range coulomb interactions are screened by the gates and thus the charge density depends on the voltage . in fig .",
    "2a we consider the situation with the incoming current from the left .",
    "backscattering off two impurities results in a `` staircase '' charge density profile ( we have averaged over friedel oscillations ) .",
    "the `` staircase '' goes up as one moves from the right to the left . for the opposite voltage sign ,",
    "the incoming current arrives from the right , fig .",
    "we again have a `` staircase '' charge density profile but now the `` staircase '' goes down as one moves from the right to the left . in the absence of electron interactions",
    ", the transmission coefficients must be the same in both cases and rectification is absent .",
    "let us now consider the effect of electron interactions in a simple mean - field hartree picture .",
    "since long - range coulomb interactions are screened , the relation between the charge density @xmath43 and the electric potential @xmath44 is local . assuming small charge density variations",
    ", we thus find @xmath45 .",
    "incoming electrons are scattered by a combined potential of the two impurities and the hartree potential @xmath44 .",
    "the latter depends on the incoming charge density and hence the applied voltage .",
    "hence , for opposite voltage signs , electrons feel different backscattering potentials .",
    "this results in different transmission coefficients and thus rectification .",
    "another mechanism of transport asymmetries comes from time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "the latter is possible in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we illustrate asymmetric transport in the absence of the time - reversal symmetry with a model system depicted in fig .",
    "while it is not a realistic model of any mesoscopic conductor , it is very simple and exhibits strong transport asymmetries .",
    "we assume no electron interactions in the model .",
    "we consider a box with four holes in its sides .",
    "each hole corresponds to a terminal in a more realistic description of a junction .",
    "we assume that all charge carriers , entering the box through the holes , have exactly the same speed , perpendicular to the wall in which the hole is made . the speed @xmath46 , where @xmath2 plays a role , similar to the electrostatic potential of a terminal in a realistic junction . at @xmath10 the speed @xmath47 and",
    "hence no current is injected . in a y - junction ,",
    "charge density , injected from each terminal , depends on its electrostatic potential .",
    "a comparison between opposite voltage signs in a realistic junction corresponds in our model to the comparison between the situations with the charge injected through the right and left holes ( figs .",
    "3a , c ) and through the upper and lower holes ( figs .",
    "3b , d ) . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the current through each hole is zero in both situations : currents of the particles , injected through the opposite holes , cancel as shown in figs .",
    "let us now turn on a magnetic field in shaded areas ( figs .",
    "if the charge carriers are injected from the upper and lower holes then the current remains zero even in the presence of a magnetic field ( fig .",
    "3d ) . indeed",
    ", the carriers never enter the region with the field .",
    "however , if the carriers arrive from the left and right holes then they are deflected by the field ( fig .",
    "3c ) and the electric currents are nonzero in all four holes .",
    "this illustrates how magnetic field can result in transport asymmetry .",
    "the above arguments make it plausible that the rectification effect is the strongest if both strong electron interaction is present and time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "this is confirmed by our calculations below for y - junctions of quantum wires with and without time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in this section we formulate our model and review basic properties of y - junctions .",
    "we consider a y - junction with the action    @xmath48,\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 are the actions of three uniform wires and @xmath50 describe three impurities in the wires close to the junction point @xmath51 .",
    "the above action must be supplied by matching conditions for three wires .",
    "they will be discussed below .",
    "the action of a uniform wire is given by the equation    @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 are the operators of incoming and outgoing chiral electron fields , @xmath54 is the effective fermi velocity , @xmath55 defines the interaction strength .",
    "we set @xmath56 and the electron charge @xmath57 in most of the following text .",
    "we assume that the long range part of the coulomb force is screened by the gates .",
    "hence , the electron density depends on the voltage bias .",
    "the impurity hamiltonians @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the potential of the impurity in wire number @xmath24 , the impurity being located close to the junction at @xmath51 .",
    "we only take the backscattering part of the impurity hamiltonian into account as the forward scattering terms do not affect our results .",
    "we assume the same interaction strength and fermi velocity in each wire .    in order to treat the case of strong interaction",
    "it is convenient to bosonize @xcite the action in terms of the chiral fields @xmath60 such that @xmath61 , where the opposite signs should be chosen for the in- and out - fields , the commutator @xmath62=\\mp2\\pi i\\delta(y - x)\\delta_{kl}\\ ] ] and @xmath63 plays the role of the effective fermi momentum and determines the average charge density in the wires .",
    "@xmath64 are klein factors , necessary to ensure the proper fermi commutation relations .",
    "the local densities of in- and out - moving particles in point @xmath65 are @xmath66 .",
    "the action now assumes the form @xmath67;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath68)+h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , with real @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are of the order of the fourier components of the asymmetric potential , @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath71 can be nonzero even for a symmetric potential @xmath73 in contrast to the situation considered in refs . .",
    "for example , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the above expression for the backscattering operators @xmath50 includes multi - particle backscattering processes.@xcite such multi - particle contributions to the action are inevitably generated under the action of the renormalization group by the interplay of a short - range coulomb interaction and impurity potential ( see ref .   for a discussion ) .",
    "all prefactors @xmath70 have the same order of magnitude and are proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that backscattering amplitudes @xmath70 have the same order of magnitude in all three wires .",
    "the use of the fields @xmath76 at @xmath51 in the backscattering operators is justified , if the distance from the impurities to the junction is lower than the scale @xmath77 set by the voltage bias .",
    "we assume that @xmath70 are sufficiently small so that a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath70 can be developed for the calculation of the current .",
    "the conditions on @xmath70 will be formulated below .    following the standard notation conventions , the hamiltonian , corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ bos ] ) , can be written as    @xmath78,\\ ] ]    where the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the above action alone is not enough to describe the system and matching conditions at the junction are necessary . as we will see , matching conditions are subject to several restrictions .",
    "the most general matching condition has the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is an arbitrary function .",
    "below we will focus on the situation in which the system is close to a fixed point . then",
    "only most relevant operators should be kept in the matching conditions and hence all derivatives of the bose - fields @xmath83 can be neglected .",
    "next , we note that the shift of any field @xmath84 by a constant @xmath85 is a gauge transformation that does not change the physics of the system .",
    "hence , the matching conditions must be invariant with respect to such gauge transformations .",
    "this singles out the boundary conditions of the form @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a matrix with real matrix elements . with this matching condition ,",
    "it is easy to solve the equations of motion for the chiral fields @xmath88 in the absence of the interaction ( @xmath89 ) and impurities , for arbitrary initial conditions for fields @xmath84 . substituting the solution into the commutation relations ( [ comm ] ) for in- and outgoing fields",
    ", one finds that they are compatible , provided that the matrix @xmath87 is orthogonal .",
    "the same condition for the matching matrix must hold for a general case with an arbitrary interaction strength @xcite since the problem can be reduced to a model of non - interacting bosons by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) in each wire ( see the next section ) .",
    "thus , we established that @xmath87 is a real orthogonal matrix .",
    "we next demonstrate that the sum of the elements of each of its rows and columns equals one.@xcite it is again convenient to consider the situation without electron interaction and tunneling . in that case",
    "the currents of in- and outgoing electrons in each wire are @xmath90 .",
    "charge conservation implies that the sum of the currents in all wires is zero at @xmath51 .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) one finds that @xmath91 .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) by @xmath92 and repeating the same argument one also finds that @xmath93 .",
    "again , electron interactions do not affect the above result @xcite .",

    "each cosine tends to keep its argument at zero .",
    "this can be achieved simultaneously for each cosine only if their arguments commute .",
    "this happens for a unitary @xmath87 .",
    "the cosines describe tunneling between different wires .",
    "thus , charge conservation implies @xmath93 .",
    "this provides an alternative derivation of the matching conditions .    since we plan to separately investigate time - reversal invariant and non - invariant systems , we next need to determine what matching conditions satisfy the time - reversal symmetry",
    "this is easy as the time - reversal transformation corresponds to the change of variables @xmath96 . from eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) we then see that in time - reversal - invariant systems @xmath97 . taking into account that @xmath87 is orthogonal",
    "we conclude that in time - reversal invariant systems it is also symmetric.@xcite the action ( [ l ] ) is always time - reversal invariant .",
    "thus , the behavior of the whole junction with respect to time reversal is determined solely by the symmetry of the matching matrix @xmath87 .    at this point",
    "we are in the position to give a full classification of fixed - point matching matrices.@xcite for time - reversal invariant systems , it is convenient to use a parametrization from ref .  .",
    "we discover three possibilities with time reversal symmetry : @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    ". eq .  ( [ identity ] ) corresponds to three disconnected wires .",
    "the cases of @xmath104 correspond to a junction of two wires and a detached third wire .",
    "the physics is the same as for one linear wire and will not be discussed below .    in the absence of time - reversal symmetry we use the parametrization from ref .  :",
    "@xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the case of @xmath109 , @xmath110 corresponds to the island setup , depicted in fig .",
    "1 . note that the matching matrix ( [ 122 ] ) has the form ( [ no - time ] ) with @xmath111 so we will consider it with the case of no time - reversal symmetry .    in general , matching matrices contain negative matrix elements .",
    "this means that the incoming current in one wire may suppress outgoing current in that or other wires .",
    "such situation is possible in the presence of andreev scattering , if , for example , a part of the junction is superconducting .",
    "negative matrix elements were also predicted in y - shaped beam splitters for cold bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "note that for noninteracting electrons no negative matrix elements are allowed @xcite since in the absence of interaction the elements of the matrix @xmath87 reduce to the squares of the absolute values of the elements of the scattering matrix ( cf .",
    "in order to calculate the current we need to include a voltage bias .",
    "we model fermi - liquid leads by assuming that electron interaction in the wires is zero at large distances @xmath65 from the junction.@xcite we will assume that leads 2 and 3 are kept at a zero voltage .",
    "the bias voltage @xmath112 is applied to lead 1 .",
    "the results do not change in a more general model with the potential @xmath112 applied to lead 1 , the potential @xmath113 , @xmath4 , applied to lead 2 , and a zero potential applied to lead 3 .",
    "we will use the language of zero @xmath114 since it is simpler .",
    "our approach can be easily extended to a general @xmath114 .",
    "the calculations will be based on a renormalization group approach with the voltage @xmath2 playing the role of the infrared cutoff .",
    "thus , we will assume that the temperature @xmath115 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the role of the voltage does not reduce solely to that of a cut - off ; otherwise the density - driven rectification would be lost ( see a discussion after eq .",
    "( [ int - repr ] ) ) .",
    "it is well known that in luttinger liquids a voltage bias can play a more prominent role than just a cut - off ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . at the same time , the leading contribution to the total current at zero temperature can be estimated by simply setting the renormalization group cutoff to the value of the voltage @xcite .",
    "below we find that the rectification current is comparable with the total current in certain regimes in the absence of the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this certainly means that in those regimes the rectification current can be computed by assuming that the voltage plays the role of a cutoff only ( we however do not make such an assumption ) .    for a general @xmath114",
    ", we do not expect the current to depend significantly on the temperature at @xmath115 .",
    "such dependence can emerge at particular values of @xmath114 .",
    "in particular , in the island setup ( fig .",
    "1 ) , this happens at @xmath116 .",
    "this can be seen from the keldysh perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "hence , at @xmath116 our approach applies only for @xmath119 in the island setup .",
    "we want to find the current in the first wire . at low frequencies the current conserves",
    "and hence it is sufficient to find the current in lead 1 .",
    "it is given by the sum of the chiral incoming and outgoing currents @xmath120 .",
    "the incoming current can be found from the landauer formula and is linear in voltage .",
    "it does not contribute to the rectification current .",
    "we thus focus on the outgoing current in lead 1 .",
    "it can be found with a generalization of the approach of ref .  .",
    "our approach is also related to that of ref . .",
    "in what follows we set the temperature @xmath121 to simplify notations .",
    "our method can be easily generalized to finite temperatures .",
    "let us introduce an auxiliary field @xmath122 : @xmath123 the field @xmath124 satisfies a simple matching condition @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the auxiliary field is a chiral field propagating through the junction . in the stationary regime",
    "the average time - derivative of any operator is zero .",
    "let us now consider the operator @xmath126 , where the integration extends between points taken in the noninteracting leads .",
    "its meaning is the charge carried by the mode @xmath124 .",

    "the first term in the right hand side is linear in the voltage bias and can not contribute to the rectification current .",
    "thus , we have to calculate only the second contribution to the right hand side .",
    "in other words , our problem reduces to the calculation of the average backscattering current whose operator equals @xmath130 , where @xmath131 \\nonumber\\\\ = & i[u_l(f^{k\\dagger}_of^k_i)^n\\exp(i\\alpha_l+in\\{\\sum_p ( m^{-1})_{kp}\\phi^p_o(0 ) -\\phi^k_o(0)\\ } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + h.c.,\\hat o ] \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it can be understood as the charge of a chiral mode propagating through the junction . in other words",

    "the role of impurities is played by three constrictions in the junctions .",
    "alternatively , one can use a single quantum hall island confined between edges ab , cd and ef ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the rectification current scales as @xmath411 at @xmath412 .",
    "time - reversal symmetry is broken in such setup .",
    "thus , the rectification current can be made comparable to the total ac current even in the low voltage regime .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "most of the time we ignored phase factors @xmath413 in tunneling operators .",
    "as the example of three weakly connected wires shows , for special values of the phases the rectification effect is suppressed .",
    "it has the same order of magnitude for other values of the phases .",
    "we considered the simplest example of a junction : 3 spin - polarized wires .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize our results to a system with spin .",
    "this may result in a more complicated behavior as the minimal model with spin includes 6 channels : two for each wire .",
    "still , we expect a similar physics .",
    "in particular , a time - reversal - invariant system with spin can be obtained from two copies of the `` island junctions '' with opposite spins and chiralities . in the absence of the interaction between the copies",
    ", the problem reduces to a spin - polarized island junction .",
    "an actual realization , based , e.g. , on a topological insulator , must involve interaction between opposite spins .",
