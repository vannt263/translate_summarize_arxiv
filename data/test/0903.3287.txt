    "euclidean geometry was assumed to be the only consistent geometry until the nineteenth century . eventually , failing to prove euclid s fifth postulate ( known as the parallel postulate ) from the others opened the door to abstract geometries .",
    "the first two abstract geometries that were historically called imaginary geometries are the hyperbolic geometry and the spherical geometry .",
    "the essential difference between euclidean and these non - euclidean geometries is the nature of parallel lines . while in euclidean geometry",

    "nilforoushan and mohades  @xcite concentrated on the hyperbolic voronoi diagram in the poincar 2d disk for which they report an incremental quadratic algorithm , and characterize geometrically the orthogonality of bisectors with geodesics .",
    "note that by using the graphics processor unit ( gpu ) , it is easy to rasterize interactively voronoi diagrams  @xcite for any arbitrary distance function , including the distance of hyperbolic geometry .    in this paper , we revisit these work by considering the klein projective disk model .",
    "we showed in section  [ sec : hvdpd ] that bisectors are hyperplanes , implying that the voronoi diagram is affine and therefore can be easily constructed from an equivalent power diagram .",

    "the klein model ( or beltrami - klein model  @xcite ) uses the interior of a unit circle for fully representing the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the klein model is also known as the projective disk model where lines are depicted by chords of the circle ( e.g. , line segments joining any two points of the circle ) .",
    "although the klein model offers a simple visualization of geodesics as line segments , it has the disadvantage of being a non - conformal representation : that is , angles of the hyperbolic plane are not preserved , and get distorted in this model .",

    "a similar lifting / projection mechanism holds for hyperbolic voronoi diagram in the upper - plane model ( the proof relying on pencils of spheres  @xcite is omitted )    the 2d hyperbolic voronoi diagram on the upper plane can be obtained by first computing the intersection of 3d halfspaces implied by the paraboloid lifting , then projecting horizontally the edges of the 3d polytope to the paraboloid , and finally projecting vertically these curves on the plane .",
