    "a particularly rich and diverse route is followed by carbon . in the cool surroundings of carbon stars  evolved stars that have dredged up large amounts of carbon to the stellar surface ",
    "more than 60 individual molecular species have been identified , including benzene , polyynes and cyanopolyynes @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spectra reveal diverse dusty materials such as hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac or a - c : h ) and silicon carbide ( sic ) . as the mass - loss process strips the outer layers of the star ,",
    "a hot ( @xmath0 k ) central white dwarf becomes exposed , whose strong uv irradiation further processes the ejecta and makes them visible as a planetary nebula ( pn ) . a key component of the carbon dust inventory in pne are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and pah - like species , a class of large and hardy carbonaceous species whose formation mechanisms are unclear @xcite .",
    "although not a single pah member has been identified in space , their characteristic spectral features at infrared wavelengths are observed throughout the universe , from which it is inferred that they reside ubiquitously in space and could lock up as much as 15% of the cosmic carbon ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "two other large aromatic species have been recently identified in space : c@xmath1 and c@xmath2 .",
    "these are the best - known members of the family of fullerenes , a class of molecules made of hexagonal and pentagonal aromatic carbon rings , fused in the shape of a hollow sphere or ellipsoid .",
    "the most abundant of these molecules , the buckminsterfullerene c@xmath3 , has the structure of an old - fashioned black and white soccer ball .",
    "the near - spherical carbon configuration of these two molecules , which have a closed surface , a closed - shell electron distribution and an almost unstrained network , results in a very high stability against dissociation and prolonged exposure to high temperature .",
    "fullerenes , in particular c@xmath3 , have peculiar and appealing photochemical , electrochemical and physical properties , which can be exploited in various fields , from nanotechnology to medicine , to space science .",
    "c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 were discovered during laser ablation experiments on graphite targets , aiming to study long carbon chains in interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "because of their remarkable stability , fullerenes appeared particularly suited to survive the harsh conditions of the interstellar medium .",
    "their unique properties indicate that they may play an important role in organic astrochemistry and astrobiology .",
    "cosmic fullerenes remained elusive until the recent discovery of c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 in the planetary nebula tc 1 by @xcite .",
    "fullerenes have since been confirmed in many more evolved star environments @xcite , as well as in young stellar objects @xcite , reflection nebulae ( rne ) @xcite and photodissociation regions @xcite .",
    "fullerenes can be efficiently synthesized in the laboratory by the vaporization of carbon rods in an electric arc @xcite and from hydrocarbon combustion under optimised conditions @xcite .",
    "however , the formation routes of fullerenes in space are still unknown .",
    "we review the currently known formation mechanisms of fullerenes in the laboratory (   [ earth_sec ] ) , showing why these methods would not work in space (   [ not_working_sec ] ) .",
    "we propose an alternative pathway , consistent with astrophysical conditions , based on the photo - processing of a family of carbonaceous species which we name `` arophatics '' (   [ our_mechanism_sec ] ) .",
    "we discuss the observations of fullerenes in pne (   [ observations_sec ] ) and finally we summarize our conclusions (   [ conclusions_sec ] ) .",
    "the original discovery of c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 dates back to 1985 with the experiment of @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "carbon species were vaporized from a graphite target into a he flow with tunable pressure / density .",
    "the vaporization was done by a pulsed laser , the resulting carbon clusters were expanded in a supersonic molecular beam , photoionized and their masses measured by a time - of - flight mass spectrometer .",
    "vaporization at low he pressure ( less than 10 torr ) leads to a broad distribution of clusters , with 38 to 120 carbon atoms ( always even numbers ) , with c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 present but not the dominant species . at a pressure of 760 torr",
    "the c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 peaks clearly dominated .",
    "when the expansion of the he+carbon cluster mixture was delayed , the resulting mass distribution was completely dominated by c@xmath3 - 50% of total large cluster abundance , and c@xmath5 , with 5 % of total large cluster abundance .",
    "these distributions have been interpreted as due to the increasing number of he - cluster and cluster - cluster collisions , resulting in the `` survival of the fittest '' , i.e. the more stable clusters .",
    "the famous icosahedral soccer ball structure was proposed for the first time for c@xmath6 , and later confirmed by spectroscopic studies @xcite .",
    "however , the elementary reaction mechanisms occurring during the `` thermalization '' process remained unknown .",
    "@xcite experimentally studied the gas - phase formation of carbonaceous compounds .",
    "their first experiment was essentially a replication of the kroto experiment , i.e. laser vaporization of a graphite target in a quenching atmosphere of he or he / h@xmath7 with pressures between 3.3 and 26.7 mbar .",
    "the vibrational temperature of the laser - induced plasma was estimated to be between 4000 and 6000 k for the laser power densities used . in a second set of experiments ,",
    "the laser - induced pyrolysis of c@xmath7h@xmath7 and c@xmath8h@xmath8 using a pulsed laser with high power densities was studied .",
    "the resulting condensation temperatures were above 3500 k , comparable with the vaporization experiment . in a third set of experiments , laser - induced pyrolysis of the same hydrocarbon precursors",
    "was carried out , but this time at a much lower temperature ( max 1700 k ) .",
    "the analysis of the condensation products showed a striking effect of the temperature . during the high temperature experiments , only fullerene - like soot and fullerenes were produced . during the low temperature experiments , only soot and pahs",
    "were formed ( 100 % pahs at @xmath9 1000 k ) .",
    "the results clearly tell that the temperature determines which kind of condensates will be formed .",
    "moreover , the two pathways seem to be mutually exclusive , at least under these experimental conditions : fullerenes and pahs can not be formed together .",
    "it is important to note that high pressure has been used during the experiments to concentrate the condensation within a small volume , i.e. to mantain a high density of the condensing species .",
    "the laboratory experiments described in the previous sections do not tell us how fullerene is formed from graphite and hydrocarbons , but only under which conditions this happens .",
    "the elementary reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of fullerenes can be investigated performing quantum chemical molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . in one set of simulations",
    "a hot carbon vapor was reproduced by putting 40 randomly oriented c@xmath7 molecules in a tiny 20  cubic box @xcite .",
    "the system was let to evolve , and extra c@xmath7 molecules were added at fixed times in order to simulate an open environment . during the first stage ,",
    "the system was kept at a constant temperature of 2000 k and giant carbon cages self - assembled . during the second stage of the simulation",
    "the temperature was raised to 3000 k , and the shrinking of these hot giant fullerenes down to c@xmath10 was observed @xcite .",
    "the formation of the giant cages starts with nucleation of polycyclic structures ( hexagons and pentagons ) from entangled polyyne chains .",
    "this is followed by growth of the structure and finally cage closure similar to the self - capping of open - ended single - walled nanotubes .",
    "because of the rapid gain of energy due to cage closure , the giant fullerenic cages are produced in a vibrationally highly excited state .",
    "the excess energy has to be dissipated , either by unimolecular dissociation or collision with other carbon clusters or carrier gas atoms .",
    "the simulations show that the newly produced giant fullerenes inevitably shrink to smaller sizes .",
    "all the road maps to fullerene formation proposed by previous models were associated with intermediate structures that are in thermodynamic equilibrium , while a hot carbon vapor is indeed a system far from thermodynamic equilibrium . in the model developed by irle , morokuma and collaborators , for the first time",
    "the dynamic self - assembly of fullerene molecules occurs as an irreversible process emerging naturally under the nonequilibrium conditions typical of a hot carbon vapor .",
    "the experimental results of @xcite have presented evidence of the spontaneous tendency of electron - irradiated graphite to include pentagons in its hexagonal network , hence form curved structures .",
    "this has been further confirmed by @xcite , who have shown that fullerenes can form directly from graphene in a similar fashion . in the experiment of chuvilin and co - workers ,",
    "a sheet of graphene was exposed to a beam of energetic 80 kev electrons .",
    "the energy transferred to the graphene results in the loss of carbon atoms from the edges of the sheet .",
    "if the size of the graphene flake is not too big ( less than a few hundreds of carbon atoms ) , the loss of carbon atoms at the edge will lead to the formation of pentagons , which triggers the curving of graphene into a bowl - shaped structure .",
    "further carbon removal from the edges using the electron beam will reduce the size of the curved structure until it is sufficiently small to zip up its open edges and isomerize into a closed fullerene structure .",
    "@xcite claim having identified the fundamental processes leading to the formation of fullerenes in a recent experimental work , based on laser vaporization of pure c@xmath3 in the presence of carbon vapor . according to this study",
    ", fullerenes would self - assemble bottom - up through a closed network growth ( cng ) mechanism based on the ingestion of atomic carbon and c@xmath7 clusters .",
    "it should be noted that the work from @xcite provides experimental evidence of the growth of larger fullerenes from pre - existing c@xmath3 only .",
    "because the experiments show that the cng of larger fullerenes does not result in the production of c@xmath6 , it is deduced that c@xmath3 formation must be a result of cng from smaller fullerenes",
    ". however , the initial formation mechanism of such smaller fullerenes is still under debate .",
    "although all the chemical ingredients and the required temperatures for graphite vaporization and hydrocarbon combustion can be found in astrophysical environments , the densities are far too low to proceed to fullerene formation on reasonable timescales . in space , the most favourable conditions for fullerene formation via vaporization / combustion are found in a post - shock gas . in such environments the fullerene building blocks , i.e. c@xmath11 groups and polycyclic species coming from the fragmentation of pahs @xcite , ought to exist in the required vibrationally excited states .",
    "however , the post - shock carbon densities are low and represent a serious obstacle to fullerene formation .",
    "we have derived the scaling rule ( eq .  [ scaling_eq ] ) relating the time @xmath12 , required for fullerene condensation , with the initial density @xmath13 of the carbon gas .",
    "the details of the calculation are reported in the appendix .",
    "this scaling rule has then been used to estimate the time necessary for the coagulation of fullerenes from a carbon gas with interstellar densities ( @xmath14 10@xmath15  carbon  @xmath16 ) .",
    "the scaling rule is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the condensation timescales corresponding to densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . knowing the density and timescale in simulations , @xmath20 and @xmath18 , and the density of the interstellar gas , @xmath21",
    ", we can then calculate the fullerene condensation time in space , @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt @xmath20  =  10@xmath22  carbon  @xmath16 and @xmath18  =  50 ps @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen density of the post - shock gas is @xmath9  1  @xmath16 , but carbon is 10@xmath15 less abundant , so @xmath21  =  10@xmath15  carbon  @xmath16 . from eq .",
    "[ scaling_eq ] we obtain @xmath19  =  1.6  @xmath23  10@xmath24 yr , which is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "we also estimate the carbon density @xmath21 required to form fullerenes in a shocked gas before the temperature drops below 1000 k. at this temperature the condensation of fullerenes can not occur . for a typical interstellar shock with a velocity of 125  km  s@xmath25 the cooling time ( after which the temperature of the post - shock gas drops below 1000 k ) is about 2@xmath2310@xmath26 yr . under these conditions ,",
    "the required carbon atom density for the condensation of fullerenes is @xmath21  =  3@xmath2310@xmath27  carbon  @xmath16 , and in space such densities do not exist outside of stellar atmospheres .",
    "@xcite propose a scheme for the direct formation of c@xmath6 from pahs in the reflection nebula ngc 7023 based on graphene dissociation experiments from @xcite . in ngc 7023 fullerenes and pahs appear to coexist in the same location close to the central star , while only pahs are detected further away from the star .",
    "according to @xcite , a similar phenomenon to the one described by @xcite occurs in ngc 7023 , but induced by photo processing instead of electron bombardment .",
    "the absorption of uv photons from the central star first completely dehydrogenates the pahs @xcite , producing graphene flakes .",
    "further photon absorption induces the loss of carbons from the edges of the graphene sheet .",
    "this , according to @xcite , gives rise to pentagonal defects which will induce the curvature of the sheet and the subsequent closure of the cage to form a c@xmath3 molecule .",
    "there are some issues related to the applicability of the results from such experiments to interstellar conditions .",
    "first of all , it is not possible in space to tune the number of carbons removed from the graphene flake in order to get the right size required for cage closure .",
    "the number of ejected carbons depends on the rather slow photodissociation process , which is governed by the dissociation parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this parameter describes the dissociation rate of a highly excited pah molecule using an arrhenius law @xcite , and to a first approximation can be seen as the energy that needs to be concentrated over a bond in order to break it and release a fragment .",
    "the dissociation probability ( and hence the dissociation rate ) decreases for increasing @xmath28 because more energy is required in the bond that has to be broken .",
    "the value of @xmath28 has been derived from experimental data only for very small pahs ( up to 24 c - atoms ) with a very open carbon skeleton .",
    "the extrapolation of such results to larger ( @xmath9 50 c - atoms ) and compact astrophysically relevant pahs dissociating under interstellar conditions is very uncertain , leading to values of @xmath28 ranging from 3.65 to 5.6 ev @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to values for the dissociation probability going from 0.5 to 3@xmath2310@xmath29 respectively . to form fullerenes during the lifetime of ngc 7023 ,",
    "the mechanism proposed by @xcite needs a specific tuning of the parameters involved .",
    "bacause the size of pahs can not be controlled as during experiments , the number of carbons in the precursor molecule is severely constrained to about 70 atoms , very close to the 60 carbons required to form c@xmath3 .",
    "more importantly , the most favourable conditions for dissociation are chosen , i.e. , the lowest value for the dissociation parameter , @xmath28 = 3.65 ev . however",
    ", this choice does not appear physically motivated .",
    "indeed , if another legitimate value is adopted for the dissociation parameter , e.g. , @xmath28 = 4.6 ev ( the value falling in the middle of the range determined for @xmath28  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the decrease of the dissociation rate is such that the fragmentation process is far too slow and the conclusion suggested in @xcite no longer holds : pahs with 70 carbon atoms require longer than the lifetime of ngc 7023 to fragment , therefore they can not be the precursors of the c@xmath3 observed at the present epoch .",
    "thus , none of these mechanisms are feasible in the astrophysical settings where fullerenes have been detected , and hence , alternative routes are needed .",
    "trace amounts of fullerenes have been identified among the dissociation products of uv - irradiated hacs @xcite .",
    "together with fullerene emission , the three pne tc 1 , smp lmc 56 and smp smc 16 show broad emission plateaus between 6  9 @xmath30 m and between 10  13 @xmath30 m , compatible with emission from h - rich amorphous carbon nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a viable formation route in space could exist that starts from hac processing ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this study we focus on the formation of fullerenes in the circumstellar environments of proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) and pne .",
    "hacs are an abundant carbonaceous dust component in both these types of objects @xcite . in addition ,",
    "one of the main characteristics of pne is their strong radiation field , which will process the hacs .      in their experiments ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that hac / a - c : h decomposition leads to a low density material ( @xmath31 g  @xmath16 ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite showed that the decomposition end - product is an aerogel - like material consisting of weakly - connected aromatic `` proto - graphitic '' or pah - like clusters in a `` friable network '' .",
    "the dehydrogenation of small carbonaceous particles , containing less than a few hundred c atoms , will likely lead to structures that resemble the particles seen by @xcite in their experiments and/or the locally aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons ( laphs ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "the particles in the @xcite experiments are found to be small alkanes , unsaturated carbon - chain radicals and small dehydrogenated pah - like species .",
    "after the release of these lighter molecules @xcite observed a strong mass peak near 500amu ( @xmath32 c atom , proto - graphitic , aromatic clusters ) having ir spectra similar to that of hac / a - c(:h ) with absorption and emission features at 3.3 , 3.4 and @xmath33 m .",
    "the results of these experiments and recent modelling @xcite therefore imply an intimate mix of aromatic clusters and aliphatic groups in small carbonaceous species .",
    "we note that the laph structures studied by @xcite have compositions in the range c@xmath34h@xmath35 to c@xmath36h@xmath37 and contain aromatic domains with only a few rings per domain , which are linked by bridging aliphatic ring systems , and should have ir spectral properties similar to hac / a - c(:h ) materials ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the conditions required for hac dehydrogenation are common in space , we can thus expect the formation of laph - like species where the aromatic components are bridged by olefinic carbon - containing rings and chains .",
    "the key component in these structures is the presence of the aliphatic bridging groups linking the aromatic clusters , in what we here call `` arophatic '' structures .",
    "such structures , analogous to an aliphatic periphery on pah molecules ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could provide sites for molecular hydrogen formation in pdrs @xcite .",
    "size - dependent @xmath38 band considerations indicate that the intrinsic aromatic clusters are indeed most likely to consist of ` isolated ' two- and three - ring systems in such small hydrocarbon particles @xcite .",
    "the non - aromatic carbon atoms are in the form of `` more flexible '' short olefinic and/or aliphatic bridging structures such as ch = ch and ch@xmath7ch@xmath7. this generic type of structure was also proposed by @xcite , who suggested that aliphatic cyclo - hydrocarbons are the precursors to aromatic cluster formation in hac materials .",
    "this kind of configuration , with aliphatic chains attached to aromatic sites , is also found in aromatic - aliphatic linked hydrocarbon ( aalh ) structures , which appear to have an important role in the nucleation of nanoparticles in soot formation in flames @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that aalhs are small and relatively simple molecules , such as 1,2-di(naphthalen- 2-yl)ethane ( dne ) , while our proposed `` arophatic '' clusters are bigger and more complex structures .",
    "the aliphatic bridging structures must be quasi - orthogonal to the aromatic species that they bridge and will be unable to transform into aromatic structures without compromising ( _ i.e. _ , destroying ) the entire structure . these active sites could , likely , interchange between @xmath39 olefinic and radical @xmath40 states with dangling bonds , in a kind of isomerisation `` flipping '' process , which could play a key role in cage closure and fullerene formation in the solid state .",
    "the work of @xcite indicates that small clusters within a - c(:h ) materials are chain - like , while the larger clusters are three - dimensional , cage - like , @xmath39 structures and as @xcite show these cage - like structures have a natural tendency to close - up and form fullerene - like and fullerene structures .",
    "the `` arophatic '' clusters are structures evolving from larger , amorphous hydrocarbon particles and , from a topological point of view , they will inevitably end up with a tube - like , cup - like or cage - like appearance ( _ e.g. _ , see the two right hand species in fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "such structures are ` curled - up ' or ` folded - over ' , defected graphite ( dg ) or graphene sheets @xcite , and we can therefore represent them by their ` flattened - out ' equivalents as per fig .",
    "12 in @xcite but with aromatic domains reduced in size to only a few rings per aromatic cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig_arophatics_0 ] ) .",
    "[ b ]        the aromatisation of the aliphatic bridges to form pentagons can provide a viable route to fullerene formation in the solid phase via these `` arophatic '' species .",
    "the key process is the dehydrogenation of the aliphatic and olefinic `` bridges '' which naturally leads to aromatic pentagon formation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_schemes ] for small a - c : h particle fragments .",
    "it appears that there is a link between small carbonaceous particle dehydrogenation in intense uv radiation fields and the formation of fullerenes , which could explain the observation of fullerenes in circumstellar regions associated with small hydrocarbon grains ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "the mechanism that we propose for fullerene formation in space is the following .",
    "the starting point is large , nm - sized , h - rich a - c : h particles containing more than a hundred carbon atoms .",
    "uv photolysis by photons with energy above 10 ev dehydrogenates these grains @xcite and leads to further changes in the molecular structure  a process that we call * stir * ( * s*tructural * t*ransformations in * i*ntense * r*adiation fields ) . stir processing requires constant heating ( by photon absorption ) to keep the particle in a vibrationally excited state that promotes structural transformations leading to the closing of cage - like structures within the a - c : h nanoparticle .",
    "amorphous carbon nanoparticles can be maintained at thermal - equilibrium temperatures of the order of 100 - 150  k by photon absorption ( for h - rich a - c : h particles with band gaps larger than 1 ev ) even at thousands of astronomical units from the central stars of pne , due to their low emissivity at the long wavelengths where they radiate thermally @xcite .",
    "however , at these same distances , almost completely dehydrogenated nanoparticles have temperatures of only tens of kelvin , as expected .    in order to form fullerenes ,",
    "the arophatic clusters resulting from stir processing must be large , containing more than a hundred carbon atoms , as exemplified in figs .",
    "[ fig_arophatics_2 ] and [ fig_movie2_shot ] .",
    "a key step in the route to fullerenes is the formation of 5-membered rings .",
    "this can occur via dehydrogenation during the stir processing of the parent a - c : h or of the emerging arophatic cluster , in a similar fashion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_schemes ] for small a - c : h particles .",
    "dehydrogenation is a viable way to introduce 5-membered rings , as indicated by @xcite .",
    "this work shows that structures with a high degree of curvature result from dehydrogenation reactions occurring in aromatic hydrocarbon compounds .",
    "these reactions involve the loss of hydrogen with rearrangement of the structure and ring closure which leads to five - membered rings , and hence curvature .",
    "uv irradiation of hac nanoparticles not only causes dehydrogenation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but also forces the structure to curl up because of the introduction of pentagonal rings .",
    "in fact , the uv - induced dehydrogenation _ is _ the cause of the formation of 5-membered rings .",

    "the initial , stir - driven ( catastrophic ) photolysis and the following cage closure induced by the formation of pentagonal rings will result in a highly excited structure .",
    "the cage will release the excess energy via ejection of c@xmath42 molecules , shrinking down to the islands of stability represented by c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the down - sizing occurs through unimolecular decomposition of the vibrationally excited cage , resulting in the ejection of carbon molecules . to model the unimolecular dissociation we adopt an arrhenius law @xcite , which describes the evolution of the dissociation rate as a function of the temperature of the dissociating species : @xmath43 the quantity @xmath44 is the rate for carbon ejection measured in carbon atom lost per second ( c / s ) , @xmath45 the vibrational temperature of the fullerenic cage and @xmath46 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the unimolecular decomposition is governed by two parameters : the pre - exponential factor @xmath47 and the dissociation energy @xmath28 .",

    "the value of 0.36 ev that we have calculated for @xmath28 should be considered as a lower limit , having been determined under the most favourable conditions for fullerene formation on earth , as indicated by simulations ( nevertheless the optimized conditions for industrial production of fullerene are quite similar ) .",

    "the shrinking stops at c@xmath1 because of the very high arrhenius dissociation energy @xmath28 for c@xmath11 elimination to c@xmath56 , @xmath57  10  ev @xcite .",
    "the estimated temperatures of a few hundreds of kelvin for fullerenes detected in planetary nebulae @xcite are far from the approximately 1000 k required to overcome this decomposition barrier @xcite .",
    "our model proposes the formation of a single c@xmath3 ( c@xmath5 ) molecule from a single large arophatic cluster .",
    "this implies that the parent a - c : h particles must be nm - sized , and therefore contain a hundred or more carbon atoms , because of the dissociative loss of carbon ( and hydrogen ) atoms that will occur during structural transformation .",
    "note that the large arophatic clusters can be further fragmented by the same radiation field that caused their formation from the parent a - c : h grain .",
    "most of the formed arophatics will fragment into structures other than fullerenes , resulting in a fullerene formation process that is rather inefficient , consistent with the low fullerene abundance observed in space so far .",
    "the peculiarities of the pne where fullerenes have been detected are their intense uv radiation fields , sufficient to sustain photo - chemical processing of hacs , and the ablation of carbonaceous material from the dense circumstellar matter formed during their agb phase .",
    "thus , in these objects abundant , nm - sized , h - rich , a - c : h dust is being liberated and undergoing catastrophic uv - photolysis , which leads to stir processing . in tc 1 , c@xmath3 and c@xmath4",
    "have been detected far for the central star ( 8000 au  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but even at this distance the uv irradiation is sufficient to keep the particles in a vibrationally excited state ( @xmath58 100 - 130  k ) and to trigger and sustain the stir processing of the a - c : h dust and the shrinking of the resulting giant fullerenic cages down to c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 .",
    "it appears that the young pne where fullerenes have been observed are the optimised factories for their formation because their stellar emission peaks in the required 10 ev photon energy regime . in their pre - pne stages",
    "these objects do not have sufficient uv photons to dehydrogenate and heat the dust , and in their later stages the radiation field is so much harder that dissociative losses will destroy the h - rich carbonaceous particles before they can re - structure to form fullerenes .",
    "we studied the formation of fullerenes c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 in planetary nebulae , for which a satisfactory formation path is still missing .    in space ,",
    "the low density of the gas precludes the formation of fullerene materials following known vaporization or combustion synthesis routes even on astronomical timescales .",
    "the direct formation of c@xmath3 through dissociation - induced curvature of dehydrogenated pahs requires a very specific tuning of the dissociation parameters , and thus appears unlikely .",
    "the scheme for fullerene formation in space that we propose is based on a top - down approach .",
    "the top of the tree is represented by large a - c : h / hac particles , i.e. materials whose presence in space has been firmly established .",
    "uv photolysis promotes structural transformations in the parent a - c : h particle with the formation of what we call `` arophatic '' clusters : 3-d , hollow structures characterized by the presence of aromatic clusters linked by aliphatic bridging groups .",
    "uv - induced dehydrogenation of the emerging arophatic cluster ( or the parent a - c : h ) introduces pentagonal rings , and hence curvature , in the evolving structure .    the result is a large , vibrationally - excited fullerenic cage that shrinks down to the stable molecules c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 through emission of c@xmath7 groups . the very high energy barrier for c@xmath7 ejection from c@xmath3 prevents further dissociation .",
    "the young pne where fullerenes have been observed appear as the optimised factories for the formation of these molecules . in their pre - pne stages",
    "the formation of fullerene - like structure is not favoured because these objects lack sufficient uv photons to dehydrogenate and heat the dust . in their later stages",
    "the radiation field is so much harder that it will destroy h - rich carbonaceous particles before they can re - structure to form fullerenes .",
