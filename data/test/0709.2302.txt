    "in calphad ( calculation of phase diagrams ) modeling@xcite , thermodynamic properties of a solution phase in a ternary  or higher - order system are usually obtained through combining those of its constitutive binary systems and occasionally with ternary interaction parameters . since the most dominant interatomic reaction in a multicomponent system is that of the binaries , accurate thermodynamic descriptions which are capable of reproducing the characteristics of binary solution phases are prerequisites to a successful multicomponent thermodynamic modeling . in this",
    "regard , considerable efforts have been made to develop models for combining thermodynamic descriptions for binary solution phases to be used in higher - order systems@xcite .    in typical thermodynamic modelings ,",
    "ternary interaction parameters for solid solution phases are not introduced since their thermochemical data , such as mixing enthalpy , which are needed in the parameter evaluation are very difficult to measure .",
    "in fact , obtaining accurate thermochemical data for solid solution phases is challenging even for binaries due to sluggish kinetics at low temperatures so that it is hard to reach a complete thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the existence of intermediate phases narrows the experimentally accessible composition range for thermochemical properties of solid solution phases .",
    "as the number of elements increases in a multicomponent system , the complexity of acquiring reliable data also increases .",
    "consequently , interaction parameters for the excess gibbs energy of binary solid solution phases are usually evaluated only from phase equilibrium data and those of ternary are usually omitted due to the lack of data .    fortunately , the dearth of experimental data for solid solution phases can be overcome by atomic level calculations , such as first - principles calculations .",
    "specially designed supercells , so - called special quasirandom structures ( sqs ) suggested by @xcite , whose lattice sites are occupied by constituent atoms so as to reproduce the average correlation functions of a completely random solution , are one of the representative methods .",
    "sqss can be completely relaxed within density functional theory ( dft ) codes to consider the effect of local relaxation and can also be applied to any other system by changing the atoms because they are structural templates .",
    "a limitation is that sqss of a unit cell size that is manageable with present dft codes can only be obtained at certain compositions , e.g. @xmath3=0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 in the substitutional @xmath4 binary alloys .",
    "nevertheless , first - principles study of sqss at those three compositions permit accurate predictions of various properties of solid solutions .",
    "it has already been successfully applied to calculate thermodynamic properties of binary solid solution phases for fcc , bcc and hcp phases@xcite .    two ternary fcc sqss in an a - b - c system , which can be applied to four different compositions at @xmath5 ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 ; and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are developed to investigate the mixing enthalpies for ternary fcc solid solution phases in the present work .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : the impact of ternary interaction parameters on a ternary solution phase in the calphad approach is briefly reviewed .",
    "then the generated ternary fcc sqss are characterized in terms of their atomic arrangements to reproduce the pair and multi - site correlation functions of completely random fcc solid solutions .",
    "finally , the generated sqss are applied to the ca - sr - yb system which presumably has fcc solid solution phases throughout the entire composition range in all three binaries and ternary .",
    "the gibbs energy of a ternary solution phase , @xmath12 , is expressed as@xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mole fraction of element @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the gibbs energy of @xmath12 phase of pure element @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the excess gibbs energies of the constitutive binary and ternary systems , respectively .",
    "the excess gibbs energies for binary and ternary systems can be further described as    @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-th order interaction parameter@xcite in a binary and normally described as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are model parameters evaluated from experimental information .",
    "ternary parameter of element @xmath15 , @xmath26 , in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : xs2_tern ] also have the form of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : xs2_interaction ] . if all three @xmath27-parameters in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : xs2_tern ] are identical , as in a ternary regular solution@xcite ,    @xmath28    then the ternary excess gibbs energy shown in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : xs2_tern ] can be further simplified to    @xmath29    since @xmath30 in a ternary .",
    "thermodynamic properties of solid solution phases can be calculated in several ways ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a popular approach is to use a database of first - principles calculations to determine the so - called effective cluster interactions ( eci ) that describe the energetics of the alloy system of interest .",
    "these interactions are then used as an input for efficient statistical mechanics methods , such as the cluster variation method or monte carlo simulations . while this general approach is able to model ordered phases ( with potential point defects ) and disordered ( with potential short - range order ) within a unified framework , it can be computationally demanding .",
    "fortunately , in cases where the sole objective is obtain a reliable thermodynamic model for disordered phases that can be reasonably assumed to lack significant short - range order , the use of sqs provides a considerably more straightforward and computationally efficient approach .    as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , first - principles study of sqs can effectively consider the limitations discussed above , and it has been demonstrated that binary sqss can be applied to calculate thermodynamic properties of binary solid solutions , such as mixing enthalpy , for fcc , bcc , and hcp structures@xcite .",
    "it is thus anticipated that first - principles calculations of ternary sqss should be able to reproduce thermodynamic properties of ternary solid solutions if their atomic configurations , which are represented as correlation functions , are very close to those of ternary solid solutions .",
    "correlation functions of solid solution phases are well derived in @xcite . in the following section ,",
    "the correlation functions for binary and ternary systems are briefly summarized .",
    "the normalized correlation functions , @xmath31 , in crystalline structures are defined as    @xmath32    where the sum is over all the distinctive @xmath33-site clusters , which are geometrically equivalent , in the @xmath34 lattice sites structure .",
    "when @xmath33=1 , 2 , 3 , @xmath35 , then @xmath33-site clusters are point , pair , triplets , and so forth .",
    "site occupation variables are denoted as @xmath36 , where the subscript @xmath33 indicates that the @xmath33-th constituent located in the corresponding site .",
    "the superscript @xmath37 takes values 2 , 3 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with @xmath39 as the number of constituents , which represents a constituent @xmath37 at a given lattice site .    for binary systems when @xmath40 , conventional values of the site occupation variables @xmath36 are @xmath411 depending on whether a lattice site is occupied by a or b atoms .",
    "according to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : correlation_function ] , the normalized point correlation function for the second constituent site ( b atom sites ) is given as @xmath42 with @xmath43 = 1 or -1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the atom sites do not need to be distinguished in a binary system since they are switchable . with the mole fractions of a and b being @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , ( @xmath46 ) then @xmath47 .",
    "for a @xmath33-site cluster , the normalized correlation functions for the binary solid solution is formulated as    @xmath48    similarly , for ternary systems when @xmath49 , the values of the site occupation variables @xmath36 conventionally take + 1 , 0 , or -1 if a lattice site is occupied by a , b , or c atoms , respectively .",
    "the normalized point correlation function for the second constituent site ( b atom sites ) is given as @xmath42 with @xmath50 + 1 , 0 , or , -1 .",
    "for the third constituent site ( c atom sites ) , the correlation function can be given as @xmath51 with @xmath50 + 1 , 0 , or , -1 .",
    "with the mole fractions of a , b , and c being @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath52 , respectively ( @xmath53 ) , then @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath45 is due to its site occupation variable being 0 . for a @xmath33-site cluster with @xmath56 b atom sites and @xmath57 c atom sites ( @xmath58 ) , the normalized correlation functions for the ternary solid solution",
    "is denoted as    @xmath59      in the present work , two different ternary fcc sqss are generated .",
    "the first sqs is at the equimolar composition where @xmath0 and the second is at @xmath1 , @xmath2 . by switching the occupation of the @xmath60 atoms in the second sqs with either @xmath61 or @xmath39 atoms ,",
    "two other sqss can be obtained where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , mixing enthalpy at four different compositions in a ternary system can be determined from first - principles total energy calculations of ternary fcc sqss by    @xmath67    where @xmath68 represents the total energy of each structure , and the reference states for all pure elements are fcc .    when the number of atoms in the ternary sqs is less than 24 , the alloy theoretic automated toolkit ( atat)@xcite has been used to generate ternary fcc sqss .",
    "since the atat enumerates all the atomic configurations within each supercell and then checks its correlation functions , the time needed to find sqss increases exponentially as the size of a supercell increases . for the sake of efficiency , to find sqss bigger than 24-lattice sites , a monte - carlo - like scheme@xcite has been used . in each supercell with different lattice vectors , atom positions are randomly exchanged between the atoms and correlation functions of a supercell are calculated after every alternation .",
    "if the correlation functions of a new state are getting closer to those of random solutions , then the new configuration is accepted .",
    "otherwise the new state is discarded and another configuration will be generated from the previous one .",
    "this process continues until the atomic arrangement of a supercell converges to the closest correlation functions of the random solution . in both methods , direct search via atat and monte - carlo - like scheme , a supercell whose correlation functions matches best with that of a completely random structure",
    "is chosen as the sqs at a given number of lattice sites .",

    "[ fig : t_sqs ] .",
    "these two sqss are selected for later calculations because they are adequate with respect to their size and correlation functions at each concentration @xmath69 . ] .",
    "the space groups of both structures are @xmath70 with all the atoms at their ideal fcc sites .",
    "the correlation functions of the generated two sqss are given in tables [ tbl : cfternabc ] and [ tbl : cfterna2bc ] , respectively .",
