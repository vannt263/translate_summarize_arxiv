    "several recent models have considered epidemics on a network that changes structure dynamically according to rules that do not depend on the nodes epidemic status @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the models of a static network or models with externally applied changes in structure , a new class of models based on endemic sis populations on an _ adaptive _ network has been recently introduced @xcite .",
    "changes to the network structure are made in response to the epidemic spread and in turn affect future spreading of the epidemic . here , the new parameter is one that describes the rewiring rate of the network , which is controlled by the fraction of susceptible ( s)-infective ( i ) links .",
    "the network alters dynamically when there are contacts between s and i , and social pressures ( the desire to avoid illness ) rewire the contacts to be instead between s and s. infections are reduced due to isolation , and a new phenomenon occurs : for appropriate choices of parameters , bistability between the disease free equilibrium and endemic state has been observed .",
    "this is in contrast to static networks in a large population , where there is typically only a single attracting endemic or disease free state .    in this paper",

    "initial conditions are constructed in one of two ways .",
    "we either generate a random ( erds - rnyi ) graph of susceptibles and convert a fraction @xmath10 of them to infectives , or we use the final state of a previous run as an initial condition .",
    "transients are discarded and simulations run long enough that the initial conditions do not affect the results .    following @xcite , we also developed a corresponding mean field model for the system .",

    "these distances are of interest because they relate to the number of hops the disease must make in order to reach an uninfected individual .",
    "the disease can not propagate through recovered nodes until they become susceptible again , so the distance from the nearest infective does not necessarily correspond to a path for disease propagation .",

    "as figure [ fig : idist]b shows , the distribution of distances for these random networks decays in the same way as it does in an adaptive network .",
    "thus the form of the distribution of distances depends mainly on local dynamics ( node and link dynamics ) rather than on the details of longer range correlations .",
    "the main difference is that the adaptive network has some nodes fully disconnected from infected components , while the random networks do not .",
    "most of these nodes are recovereds with degree 0 , which appear when infectives of degree 0 recover .",

    "[ fig : bdparamq0064 ] and [ fig : bdparamq0016 ] that depending on the value of the re - susceptibility rate @xmath3 , the bistability regions iii are vastly different .",

    "this is known to cause very different scaling laws in generic problems , which can be much slower @xcite .        to motivate the power law scaling of the fluctuations , we consider scaling near a generic saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the simplest generic case of a saddle - node bifurcation for equilibrium points comes from solving for zeroes of the vector field at a parameter value where one eigenvalue of the jacobian passes through zero .",
    "standard normal form analysis allows one to consider the generic problem of a saddle - node bifurcation . in one dimension , the stochastic differential equation of a saddle - node bifurcation may be modeled as @xmath57 the parameter is @xmath58 , and we suppose noise is additive . since noise in general may cause a `` shift '' in parameter values where the saddle - node point disappears , we assume that the noise near the bifucation is sufficiently small , where @xmath59 is a white noise term , and @xmath60 is a brownian increment .",
    "we further assume that we are always near the attracting branch of the saddle - node , so we are in a near equilibrium setting . such an assumption allows us to examine the stationary probability density function ( pdf ) of the stochastic dynamics by employing the fokker - planck equation near steady state . for the stochastic differential equation , eq .",

    "we obtained spurious results for our system with @xmath21 nodes , possibly because the small system size led to rapid die out and we were unable to obtain good statistics near the bifurcation point . away from the bifurcation point ,",

    "@xcite , the rewiring leads to bistability of the endemic and disease free states .",
    "a mean field version of the model predicted the steady states with good numerical accuracy and was also valuable in studying the fluctuations of the system , with the caveat that one must be near the appropriate type of bifurcation in the mean field to obtain corresponding results . with the addition of the recovered class and re - susceptibility rate",
    ", we can control the width of the bistability region by manipulating the location of the bifurcation points .",
    "we studied the effects of the rewiring on the network geometry .",
    "degree distributions were altered , and mean field arguments were able to predict the distributions for susceptibles and recovereds .",
    "however , a new analytical approach that includes correlations is needed to fully understand the degree distributions .",
    "the other network property we considered was the distribution of distances from non - infected nodes to the nearest infective , a quantity that may be important in disease spreading and its control .",
    "this distribution depended primarily on node and link dynamics rather than on higher order correlations , so it could be predicted from random graphs .",
    "it is possible to compute the distribution of distances from an infective analytically for random graphs , but this calculation is awkward for a three species system ( s , i , r ) and does not have a simple functional form , so we have omitted discussion of analytical results here .",
    "delayed outbreaks were observed in the rewired system .",
    "peaks in the infective fraction lagged behind peaks in the number of nodes that neighbor an infective . for the parameter values studied here , the lag time is on the order of 10% of the mean infectious period , which might be considered a very short lag time .",
    "however , the parameters in this study were not selected to correspond to any specific disease . for most real diseases",
    ", we would expect a much slower rate for immunity to wear off and recovered individuals to become susceptible again , compared to the mean infectious period .",
    "this regime would be more difficult to study in monte carlo simulations , since the average number of infected nodes would be much smaller than seen here .",
    "further work is needed to determine whether the observation of delayed outbreaks due to rewiring would persist or perhaps become more significant in a physically realistic system .",
    "finally , we considered lifetimes of the endemic state near the saddle - node bifurcation where it loses stability . in order to achieve extinction from a steady state , the disease must first overcome the attractive forces , which are weak near the bifurcation point .",
    "due to the generic local topology of the saddle - node structure , the escape rate is well characterized analytically @xcite .",
    "we found that the monte carlo simulation agrees qualitatively with the escape times and yields a well - known power law .",
    "however , this is for parameters in which endemic and extinction states are not too far apart .",
    "such extinction regimes can be analyzed using a fokker - planck approach @xcite .",
    "although preliminary results are in agreement with the expected scaling , further study of the lifetime scaling is needed , including in regimes that are physically realistic , and where the usual extinction rates can not be modeled with a fokker - planck approach .",
    "in addition to the directions for further research mentioned above , a major challenge is to develop network geometries and rewiring rules that are more consistent with human social networks .",
    "real social networks are expected to have community structure @xcite .",
    "the networks studied here did not . in our rewired networks ,",
    "the number of connections from non - infected nodes to infected nodes was reduced in comparison to a random network , while the number of connections between non - infected nodes was increased . however",
    ", this process does not induce a community structure on the network in the newman - girvan q - modularity sense @xcite .",
    "rewiring was a non - local effect ; new neighbors were chosen at random amongst all non - infected nodes in the network rather than introducing a local structure .",
    "it has been shown for static networks that community structure affects disease dynamics @xcite , and we expect an impact in adaptive networks as well .    in the current work ,",
    "an ideal setting was proposed where non - infected nodes were assumed to behave rationally and have perfect knowledge of the disease status of their current neighbors and potential new neighbors .",
    "it would be of interest to consider a situation in which not all contagious individuals appear ill or know that they are contagious , as might be the case for a sexually transmitted disease possessing asymptomatic individuals .. this effect might be modeled by simultaneous spreading through the network of both the disease and information about the disease . if the current model is extended with information and community structure , social dynamics could be extrapolated to improve contact tracing and epidemic control in organized populations with local structure .",
