    "starting with the original suggestion by cornwall @xcite , the possibility of a nonzero gluon mass has been discussed in various contexts over the past 15 years . it has been argued ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) that the severe infrared singularities of the gluon interaction might resolve themselves in the creation of a gluon mass .",
    "the emergence of this mass might be closely related to the nontrivial nature of the qcd vacuum , in particular to the gluon condensate of shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite .",
    "however unlike the by now very much established gluon condensate or the constituent mass of quarks , the concept of a gluon mass meets a lot of reservation as it touches the fundamental principles of gauge invariance and renormalizability .",
    "as argued by many authors and in particular by @xcite , the only way to make massive nonabelian vector mesons compatible with a decent high energy behaviour , i.e. with renormalizability , seems to be the higgs mechanism .",
    "the effective lagrangian advocated in @xcite for a massive gluon theory - field in the lagrangian in terms of the gauge field ] in fact can be understood as a higgs model with the ramification that all physical higgs particles have been removed from the theory by making them infinitely heavy .",
    "more precisely , this model is the generalization of the @xmath3 higgs - model with a frozen radial degree of freedom to the case of the gauge group @xmath4 . in this gauged nonlinear @xmath5-model , the @xmath6",
    "would - be goldstone bosons provide the longitudinal polarization degrees of freedom for the gluons . in the unitary gauge",
    ", they are absorbed into the redefinition of the gauge field , leaving us with a massive vector boson theory with a global @xmath4 symmetry .    though the conflict between a gluon mass and gauge invariance is avoided in this model",
    ", the renormalizability has obviously been lost in the way of going from a linear @xmath5-model to the nonlinear one .",
    "one of the main questions then is , how severe the loss of renormalizability really is .",
    "from the situation of @xmath3 , where the resulting new divergence is only logarithmic in the cut - off or the physical higgs mass - a fact known as screening theorem of veltman @xcite - , we may hope for a similar behaviour in the @xmath4 case . to clarify this point",
    ", the systematic analysis of @xcite for the divergencies should be extended from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "another critical issue to the significance of this model as an effective low energy theory is the confinement property . in the higgs phase ,",
    "i.e. the phase corresponding to superconductivity , magnetic monopoles are confined and the wilson loop in the fundamental representation satisfies a perimeter law .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that at some critical coupling the model is expected to undergo a transition to a phase with condensed vortices . in this phase the t hooft loop , i.e.",
    "the order parameter related to confinement of monopoles , can be shown to satisfy a perimeter law implying - according to the classification of phases by t hooft @xcite - an area law for the wilson loop in the fundamental representation .    on the phenomenological side , effects of a finite gluon mass",
    "have been considered in the past for the standard quarkonium decays into gluons @xcite , potential models for glue - balls @xcite , approximations to the qcd - hamiltonian combined with a variational method @xcite , a possible relation between the gluon condensate and the gluon mass through qcd sum - rules @xcite , the two - gluon exchange contribution to the pomeron @xcite , and the vacuum functional of @xmath4 yang - mills theory @xcite .    in a recent analysis",
    "@xcite of @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays it was investigated in detail whether the deficiencies between experiment and theory for the total decay rate and the inclusive photon spectrum can be understood as being due to relativistic corrections or alternatively due to a finite gluon mass .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite is that the relativistic corrections needed to bring experiment and theory into agreement do not scale in the expected manner when going from c - quarks to b - quarks .",
    "the alternative with a gluon mass leads to values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays , respectively .",
    "the authors interpret the rise of the gluon mass parameter as an indication that without phase - space limitation the true gluon mass would be of the order of @xmath11 and is reduced to effectively smaller values due to phase space limitations in @xmath8 and @xmath7 decays .    as a continuation of previous efforts to determine phenomenological values for the gluon mass , we treat in this paper the following three subjects .",
    "first we complete in section 2 the analysis of @xcite by taking into account a finite gluon mass not only in the phase space but also in the amplitudes for @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays . for this purpose",
    "we derive the analytical form of the dalitz distributions for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for massive gluons to leading order in @xmath15 , thus extending the classical formulas originally derived for positronium decays ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using these results we determine by a comparison with the results of @xcite corrected values for the gluon mass .    as a further basic process affected by a finite gluon mass we consider in section 3 the @xmath2 annihilation into mass - less quarks .",
    "the analytic form of the vacuum polarization to order @xmath16 with a massive vector boson has been known for a long time @xcite . analyzing the dispersion relation for the derivative of the vacuum polarisation function , a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath17 can be derived for the euclidean region .",
    "this expansion can serve as a basis to relate the gluon mass m to the gluon condensate by equating the @xmath18 term in this expansion with the @xmath18 term in the operator product expansion as used before in ref . @xcite . as it turns out ,",
    "the expression obtained in this way is different from the expression in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a mellin - transform technique has been used to isolate the @xmath18 term in the loop diagrams .",
    "our relation can be used to derive a simple expression for the gluon mass in terms of the gluon condensate .    in a similar spirit we deal in section 4 with the two - point function for the scalar glue - ball current instead of the electromagnetic current .",
    "matching the result obtained for this two - point function in the massive theory with the result obtained from the operator expansion in the massless theory , a similar , albeit not exactly identical , relation between the gluon mass and the gluon condensate is obtained .    in section 5 finally the results are summarized and a few remarks concerning possible future directions of this research are made .",
    "in this section we present our results for the decay rates of triplet @xmath19 and singlet @xmath20 @xmath21-wave quarkonia states into massive gluons .",
    "the calculation uses the standard approximation of neglecting the dependence on the momenta of the heavy quarks .",
    "accordingly we can write :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 represents the spatial @xmath24 wave - function at the origin and @xmath25 is calculated with @xmath26 and @xmath27 at rest .",
    "we use @xmath28 to parametrize the dependence on the ratio between gluon mass @xmath29 and quark mass @xmath30 . on the level of our approximation ,",
    "@xmath31 of course can be identified with the mass of the respective singlet or triplet quarkonium state .",
    "we start with the @xmath32 decay rate which is given by :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the decay rate for @xmath35 and the gluon mass effects on the amplitude squared and the phase space have been separated for convenience . as can be seen from eq.([gg ] ) the amplitude squared decreases with increasing @xmath29 , though compared to the phase space the effect only starts at one order higher in @xmath36 .    for the dalitz distribution of @xmath37",
    "we obtain the basic formula :    @xmath38    where the variables @xmath39 are related to the gluon energies @xmath40 by @xmath41 .",
    "similar to before @xmath34 represents the integrated decay rate for mass - less gluons .",
    "apart from the constant term proportional to @xmath36 , eq.([ggg ] ) has a similar form as in the mass - less case , i.e. the numerator of the distribution can be written as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a second order polynomial in @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 reduces to the form @xmath47 , well known from the classic positronium formula .",
    "when one of the gluons , say gluon 1 , is replaced by a photon , the corresponding expression reads with @xmath48 replacing @xmath49 :    using these expressions and integrating over phase space we can now make a simple analysis to estimate new values for the gluon mass which take into account both phase - space and amplitude effects .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "1,2 , where the integrated decay rate is plotted as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "as can be seen , the inclusion of the gluon mass in the amplitude leads to an increase of the decay rate .",
    "this feature might be expected on the basis that for massive gluons there are in addition the channels involving longitudinal gluons . using the values for the gluon mass from ref.(@xcite ) i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", respectively , we conclude that in order to reach the same level of suppression the gluon mass values change to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the numbers in brackets refer to the case where the @xmath55 reaction is used to make the matching .",
    "[ f3 g ]    [ fgamma+2 g ]    another quantity of interest is the photon energy spectrum .",
    "the analytic form is given in the appendix .",
    "examples for the effect of the gluon mass on the shape of this distribution are shown in fig .",
    "3 . as can be seen , the larger gluon mass needed to produce the same amount of suppression when the gluon mass effect is taken into account in both the amplitude and the phase space , leads to a sharper cut - off at the end of the spectrum .",
    "however , in this region we can not take the massive gluon model really serious , and there are other effects like the fermi - motion of the quarks to which this behaviour is sensitive to .",
    "[ fgammadist ]",
    "[ fvacpol ]    as a further basic process we consider now the leading order effect of a massive gluon on the electro - magnetic vacuum polarisation , i.e. the diagrams given in fig . 4 .",
    "to simplify matters , we take the massless quark limit .",
    "a systematic expansion in terms of @xmath17 can most easily be derived starting from the dispersion relation for the derivative of the vacuum polarisation function .",
    "@xmath56    the imaginary part @xmath57 for the diagrams in fig .",
    "4 has been known for a long time @xcite , and for @xmath58 is given by :    @xmath59    for convenience the normalisation has been factored out , i.e. @xmath60 for a single quark flavor with unit charge and @xmath61 colours .",
    "eq.([vacpol:1 ] ) also determines @xmath57 for @xmath62 through the symmetry relation :    @xmath63    the function @xmath64 has the small-@xmath44 expansion : @xmath65 as a consequence , the following expansion for @xmath66 in terms of @xmath17 can be derived :    @xmath67    numerically we have :    @xmath68    equation ( [ d - expansion ] ) should be compared with the result from the operator - product expansion :    @xmath69    the first term represents the perturbative contribution from the diagrams in fig.4 with massless gluons , and the second term is the contribution from the gluon condensate as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in our normalization ) . equating the @xmath18 terms in ( [ d - expansion ] ) and ( [ svz ] )",
    ", we obtain :    @xmath70    the corresponding expression derived in @xcite reads :    @xmath71    which has no resemblance to what we have obtained .    at present the origin of this discrepancy",
    "is not satisfactorily explained .",
    "however , since our own calculation only uses standard feynman diagram techniques and has been checked by an independent calculation where the diagrams in fig.4 are calculated by a numerical procedure along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , we suspect that the mellin transform technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite has not been properly applied .    a @xmath72-independent relation between m and the gluon condensate",
    "can be obtained from eq.([mass - cond:1 ] ) by using for @xmath73 the standard expression @xmath74 for the running coupling with @xmath75 and evaluating eq.([mass - cond:1 ] ) to leading order in @xmath76 .",
    "the result is :    @xmath77    yielding @xmath78 for @xmath79 and the standard svz - value for the gluon condensate @xmath80 .",
    "instead of the electromagnetic current we consider in this section the scalar glue - ball current defined in terms of the gluon field - strength tensor @xmath81 by    @xmath82    for ease of writing we use @xmath83 to denote the current with a unit normalization factor and @xmath84 for the current with a normalization factor @xmath85 which turns @xmath84 into a renormalization group invariant quantity . instead of the more generally valid factor @xmath86    as a first step we calculate the diagram in fig . 5 for @xmath83 in the massive theory .",
    "defining @xmath87 for euclidean @xmath88 by :    @xmath89    we obtain : @xmath90 where @xmath91 means equality up to polynomial terms which do not survive a three - fold subtraction needed to remove the uv - divergencies . from ( [ gg - pihat:2 ] )",
    "we obtain the following expansion in terms of @xmath17 :    @xmath92    which is free of logarithmic factors @xmath93 up to order @xmath18 . as visible from this expression ,",
    "the normalization of @xmath94 has been chosen such that the third derivative equals to one in the massless limit .",
    "[ fggcorr ]    as a second step we make a renormalization - group analysis for the coefficient function of the gluon condensate @xmath95 in the operator- product expansion of the two - point function @xmath96 for the scalar current @xmath97 :    @xmath98    the coefficient function @xmath99 has the following expansion in @xmath85 :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is a constant whose value can be found from applying wick s theorem to the product of currents @xmath102 : @xmath103 independence of @xmath99 from the renormalization point @xmath104 requires the coefficient @xmath105 in ( [ c_gg:1 ] ) to be a polynomial of degree @xmath106 in the variable @xmath107 . choosing @xmath108 and using the @xmath109-loop expression for @xmath110 , we obtain :    @xmath111    where @xmath112    the desired relation between m and the gluon condensate is now obtained by matching the @xmath18 terms in eq.([c_gg:2 ] ) and @xmath113 .",
    "the result is :    @xmath114    comparing with the result obtained in section 3 in eq.([m_vp ] ) , we recognize that we have almost obtained the same result except that the numerical coefficient is smaller by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "thus the previous estimate for @xmath29 is reduced from @xmath115 to @xmath116    it is interesting to compare eq.([m_gg ] ) with the result of ref.(@xcite ) obtained by a variational investigation of an ansatz for the vacuum functional .",
    "again both results have the same structure and color dependence ( large @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , here there is a large difference in the numerical constant , i.e. @xmath117 for ref.(@xcite ) instead of @xmath118 . as a consequence",
    "their mass estimate is larger by a factor @xmath119 .",
    "in this paper we have continued previous attempts to estimate values for the gluon mass by confronting results obtained in leading order calculations for massive gluons with experimental results ; either by a direct comparison as for @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays or in a more indirect way by matching against nonperturbative contributions in the correlator of the electromagnetic current or the scalar glue - ball current . for the decays of heavy quarkonia the dalitz distributions involving @xmath120 or",
    "@xmath121 massive gluons were derived , extending thus the basic formulae originally derived for positronium to this more general case .",
    "we then analyzed the leading qcd correction of the electromagnetic vacuum polarisation and determined the coefficients in an expansion in @xmath122 which are relevant for a comparison with the leading nonperturbative contribution for this quantity .",
    "we found a different result for the @xmath18-coefficient as previously given in the literature and claim that our result is correct as it has been checked by a completely different method than the one presented in this paper .",
    "our result was then used to derive a simple renormalization - group invariant expression between the gluon mass and the gluon condensate .",
    "finally a similar kind of analysis was applied to the correlator of the scalar glue - ball current where gluon mass effects already appear on the @xmath109-loop level .",
    "again this leads to a relation between the gluon mass and the gluon condensate which is renormalization group invariant although with a slightly different numerical coefficient",
    ".    taken at face value , there is a large spread between the mass estimates from heavy quarkonia decays , in particular the @xmath8-decays where we can expect gluon mass effects to have fully developed , and the values obtained from the analysis of the correlators .",
    "certainly the value of @xmath123 obtained from @xmath8-decays should be considered as an upper bound , since the starting values of @xcite for the gluon mass have been obtained under the assumption that the main suppression comes from the gluon mass , not the relativistic corrections .",
    "as argued for instance in @xcite , the pattern of suppressions in the total @xmath7 and @xmath8 decay rates can quantitatively be reproduced if the momentum dependence of the quarks is taken into account .",
    "whether this straightforward incorporation of relativistic effects is legitimate is , however , still under debate ( see @xcite ) , and therefore a substantial gluon mass - though smaller in magnitude than the values discussed here - may indeed be required by the data . the results from matching the leading nonperturbative correction in the correlator for the electromagnetic and the scalar glueball current are equal to each other up to a factor of @xmath1 in the relation for @xmath124 .",
    "although this has little effect on the numerical value of the gluon mass @xmath29 , the dependence on the process remains to be explained . in this context",
    "it would also be interesting to derive the expansion in powers of @xmath125 of the total decay rates of heavy quarkonia discussed in section 2 and match them likewise against the leading nonperturbative correction from the gluon condensate .",
    "a more complete analysis should also cover the @xmath122 corrections obtained in the massive theory , which seem to have no correspondence in the operator - product expansion .",
    "it has been argued in ref.(@xcite ) that these corrections cancel against corrections from the formation of a vortex condensate .",
    "we believe that this proposition requires further examination .",
    "one of us ( w.w . ) would like to thank the physics department of wuhan university for the kind hospitality which has been extended to him in 1995 and 1996 on the occasion of his visits as foreign scholar .",
    "for the distribution of the photon in @xmath126 the following expression is obtained from eq.([gamma2 g ] ) by integrating over the gluons ."
