    "the creation of public archives of high - value observational data ( e.g. , nasa s hsearc ) has been a great boon to astronomical research in the past decade .",
    "it has given rise to a new kind of astronomer  the archival astronomer  who is free to check the methods and results of the data s authors , as well as to pursue independent , and sometimes novel , lines of inquiry .",
    "archival astronomy is expected to grow in scope and importance in the coming decade . by creating this archive of simulated x - ray clusters ,",
    "we hope to extend this concept into the computational realm where simulations are growing in size and complexity .",
    "our goal is to produce large , statistical catalogs of @xmath1 100 clusters simulated at high resolution for two cases : ( 1 ) with , and ( 2 ) without non - adiabatic physical processes , in order to :  @xmath2 understand the role of non - adiabatic processes in x - ray clusters , +  @xmath2 make definitive predictions of the xlf evolution in both cases , +  @xmath2 compare degree of cluster substructure with observational samples , +  @xmath2 determine frequency of cooling flows as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "+ we simulate a @xmath0cdm model with parameters @xmath4 .",
    "the survey volume is @xmath5 mpc on a side .",
    "we employ a new hydro+n - body code @xcite which uses adaptive mesh refinement to place high resolution grids where needed .",
    "first , a survey calculation was performed with @xmath6 cells , @xmath7 particles , and two levels of refinement everywhere to locate the clusters in our sample .",
    "then , each cluster is recomputed with up to 7 levels of refinement within the cluster environment .",
    "the dm mass resolution is @xmath8 ; the l7 spatial resolution is @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the adiabatic ( control ) sample is near completion and being analyzed .",
    "preliminary results focusing on the ten brightest clusters have been reported in @xcite and a second , more extensive paper is in preparation .",
    "amr simulation data structures are hierarchical and complex , and require specialized software for their manipulation and analysis @xcite .",
    "one of the design goals of the sca was to shield the user from the complexity ( and size ) of amr simulation data .",
    "we accomplished this by developing the sca as a workbench - style system that lets users interact with the archived data over the web .",
    "the user begins by selecting a cluster from a catalog list or a 3d vrml map .",
    "the server then retrieves the raw amr data from ncsa s mass storage system .",
    "once the data is on the sca web server , the user extracts from the amr files particle data and field data sampled to a uniform grid of user - specified size and resolution . at this point ,",
    "the user may export the extracted data as hdf files for local analysis or use the suite of analysis tools provided as a part of the sca .",
    "the tools , which include 2d and 3d visualization tools , x - ray and sz imager , and graphing tool , are implemented as thin java applets in a client- server model .",
    "more detail can be found in @xcite .",
