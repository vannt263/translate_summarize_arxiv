    "the single - impurity kondo model  @xcite is unquestionably one of the most important models studied in condensed matter physics over the past decades .",
    "the investigation of its equilibrium properties has caused the development of important theoretical tools such as renormalization group methods or the bethe ansatz for impurity systems  @xcite .",
    "more than 20 years ago it was also realized  @xcite that the kondo model can be used to describe transport experiments through quantum dots .",
    "the developments in the ability to engineer devices on the nanoscale has led to the experimental realization of kondo physics in such systems  @xcite .",
    "one particular advantage of these quantum dots is the almost full control over system parameters like temperature , bias and gate voltages , magnetic field , and exchange couplings .",
    "these possibilities have triggered a great interest in the theoretical study of quantum dots out of equilibrium .",
    "a wide range of theoretical methods has been applied in the past , including non - equilibrium perturbation theory  @xcite , the flow - equation method  @xcite , coulomb gas representations  @xcite , real - time and functional renormalization group methods  @xcite , a non - equilibrium extension of the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method  @xcite , and time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques  @xcite .",
    "these studies established the importance of relaxation and decoherence effects for the understanding of non - equilibrium physics . from an experimental point of view",
    "various measurable quantities like the steady - state current , the magnetization , and the static susceptibility have been calculated .    beside the application of these techniques",
    "there were also attempts to employ the known integrability of certain impurity models in equilibrium , notably the anderson impurity model and the interacting resonant level model , to investigate their non - equilibrium properties .",
    "konik et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the differential conductance in the anderson impurity model by combining the well - known scattering states of the equilibrium system  @xcite with a landauer - bttiker formalism . in this work the chemical potentials in the leads",
    "were coupled to dressed excitations rather than free electrons and the calculation was restricted to a subset of the excitations .",
    "in contrast , a different approach was recently put forward by metha and andrei  @xcite to treat the interacting resonant level model .",
    "they constructed a new set of scattering states of bethe - ansatz form which share the quantum numbers of free electrons in the incoming channel , hence allowing the application of a finite voltage in the usual manner .",
    "however , questions concerning the existence of these scattering states and issues related to the used regularization scheme of the theory remain open .",
    "nevertheless , the interacting resonant level model has become one of the benchmark systems in the study of non - equilibrium physics  @xcite .    despite the large number of studies of impurity models out of equilibrium only few results are known for the dynamical correlation functions .",
    "the spin dynamics of a non - equilibrium quantum dot has been studied by using a majorana fermion representation  @xcite , which yields the qualitative low - frequency properties of the correlation functions . the transverse susceptibility in a kondo model",
    "was studied by paaske et al .",
    "@xcite using non - equilibrium perturbation theory together with a pseudo - fermion representation of the kondo spin .",
    "they showed that the fourier transform of the transverse susceptibility possesses a peak if its frequency equals the value of the applied magnetic field , @xmath6 , and that the width of this peak is given by the transverse spin relaxation rate @xmath7 .",
    "their derivation was , however , restricted to either the regime @xmath8 or @xmath9 , where @xmath0 denotes the applied voltage .",
    "very recently , fritsch and kehrein  @xcite applied the flow - equation method to study the longitudinal correlation function as well as the magnetization and t - matrix in a kondo model in and out of equilibrium .",
    "the numerical solution of the two - loop scaling equations allowed them to study the correlation function for all combinations of the parameters voltage , temperature , and magnetic field , provided the weak - coupling condition ( i.e. the presence of a large enough infrared cutoff ) was satisfied . in particular , these numerical solutions were used to compare the effects of an applied voltage and a finite temperature , revealing qualitative differences such as the appearance of kondo splitting in the non - equilibrium situation . in general , however , this method can not provide analytic expressions for the line shape .",
    "in this article we will generalize the real - time renormalization group method in frequency space  @xcite to allow the calculation of dynamical correlation functions of arbitrary dot operators in systems describing spin and/or orbital fluctuations . in this setting the quantum dot is coupled to non - interacting leads which are held at different chemical potentials .",
    "the derived two - loop rg equations can be solved analytically in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "explicitly , we calculate the longitudinal and transverse spin - spin correlation and response functions in a two - lead kondo model in a magnetic field @xmath1 up to order @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the effective coupling at the energy scale @xmath12 where the flow of the coupling constant is cut - off . in order to satisfy the weak - coupling condition @xmath13 either the applied voltage or the magnetic field have to be sufficiently large compared to the kondo temperature , @xmath14 , where @xmath3 is the scale where the system enters the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we note that the applied formalism does not rely on a fermionic representation of the kondo spin but rather deals with its matrix representation in liouville space directly .",
    "the longitudinal response function possesses a peak at the spin relaxation rate @xmath15 , which gets suppressed in a finite magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , in the case of a strong magnetic field , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the renormalized magnetic field ( see eq .   for the precise value ) , the longitudinal correlation and response function show `` kink - like '' structures at the frequencies @xmath18 , which were also observed using the flow - equation method  @xcite .",
    "here we additionally provide the line shape close to these `` kinks '' and show that the real part of the response functions shows characteristic logarithmic features at @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore we study the longitudinal and transverse fluctuation - dissipation ratios .",
    "as expected these ratios show a revival of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite provided the applied voltage is small compared to the magnetic field or the considered oscillation frequency .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next two sections",
    "we will define the general set up we want to study and define the used notations",
    ". this will include the kondo model , the notion of liouville operators as well as the definition of the symmetrized correlation function and susceptibility . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pe ] we will then derive perturbative expansions for the kernels needed to calculate these correlation functions . this will be performed in liouville space ; the expansion is done in powers of the exchange coupling between the dot and the reservoirs .",
    "these perturbative expansions can be applied to any model describing spin and/or orbital fluctuations as well as correlation functions of arbitrary operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : genrg ] we will use these results to derive the rg equations for the kernels of pure dot operators . in the following section we will further specialize to the two - lead kondo model , where we use the explicit expressions of the liouville operator and the coupling between the dot and the reservoirs to derive analytic results for the effective kernels appearing in the correlation functions .",
    "finally , these expressions for the kernels are used in secs .",
    "[ sec : cf ] and  [ sec : tcf ] to calculate the longitudinal and transverse correlation and response functions .",

    "all notations which we will use in the following were originally set up . in order to increase the readability of the present manuscript we will briefly recall the basic formulas and notations .",
