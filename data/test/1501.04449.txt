    "understanding of this turbulence is therefore essential for the proper interpretation of astronomical radio observations .",
    "the properties and characteristics of this turbulence can best be studied by observing point - like radio sources , where the results are not influenced by the extended structure of the source , but instead are directly attributable to the effect of the ism itself .",
    "pulsars are such sources . dispersion and scattering affect radio emission from pulsars . whereas dispersion in the plasma column introduces delays in arrival time that depend upon frequency and results in smearing of the pulse , scattering by density inhomogeneities causes angular broadening , pulse broadening , intensity modulation or scintillation , and distortion of radio spectra in the form of diffraction patterns .",

    "the interferometric visibility on these long baselines takes the form of random phase and amplitude variations that vary randomly with observing frequency and time . in the fourier - conjugate domain of delay and fringe rate ,",
    "the visibility forms a localized , extended region around the origin , composed of many random spikes .",
    "we characterize the shape of this region using averages and correlation functions .",
    "we argue theoretically that its extent in delay is given by the average envelope of the impulse - response function of interstellar scattering , sometimes called the pulse - broadening function .",

    "our long baseline interferometer completely resolves the scattering disk .",
    "instead we see a distribution of spikes around zero delay and fringe rate that is concentrated in a relatively limited region of the delay - fringe rate domain .",
    "the locations of the various spikes appear to be random .",
    "because the scattering disk is completely resolved on our long baseline , we conclude that the spikes are a consequence of random reinforcement or cancellation of paths to the different locations of the two telescopes , and hence interferometer phase .    in figure",
    "[ fig : frrt_delay ] , the distribution of the magnitude of visibility is relatively broad along the delay axis and relatively narrow along the fringe rate axis .",

    ", the visibility shows many narrow , discrete spikes .",
    "if statistics of the random phase and amplitude of scintillation are gaussian , and the phases of the fourier transform randomize the different sums that comprise the visibility in the delay - fringe rate domain , then the square modulus of @xmath72 should be drawn from an exponential distribution , multiplied by the envelope defined by the deterministic part of the impulse - response function , as discussed in the appendix .    along the delay axis",

    "the widths are somewhat larger than values expected from observing bandwidth of 16  mhz and time span of 71.4  s , of @xmath80  ns and @xmath81  mhz respectively , probably because of the non - uniformity of receiver bandpasses and pulse - to - pulse intensity variations , respectively .",
    "the broader part of the distribution takes an exponential form along the fringe - rate axis in this case ; more generally , the form can be complicated , particularly over times longer than 600  s. traveling ionospheric disturbances may affect the time behavior of our 92-cm observations ; in particular , they may be responsible for the 20 to 25  mhz width of the narrow component in fringe rate , as noted in table  [ tab : scatt_params ] .",
    "we do not analyze the broader distribution in fringe rate further in this paper ; we will discuss this distribution , and the influence of traveling ionospheric disturbances , in a separate publication ( paper iii , popov et al . in preparation ) .",
    "because of the relatively small optical path length of the ionosphere , even at @xmath82  cm , they can not affect the cross spectrum @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the magnitude of the visibility in delay / fringe - rate domain changes with baseline length .",
    "figure  [ fig : delay_fine_structure ] displays cross - sections through the maximum of the distribution of magnitude for a range of baseline lengths , as a function of delay . the maxima lie near zero fringe rate , as expected . under the plausible and usual assumption that the correct fringe rate lies at the fringe rate , @xmath83 , where the distribution peaks ,",
    "the cross - section represents the visibility averaged over the time span of the sample : @xmath84 the top panel of figure  [ fig : delay_fine_structure ] shows this cross - section through figure  [ fig : frrt_delay ] .",
    "the next lower panel shows the cross - section for the slightly shorter kl - ra baseline .",
    "the three lower plots give the equivalent cross - sections for 10 times and 100 times shorter projected baselines .",
    "these three short - baseline cross - sections are qualitatively different from the long baseline cross sections : the visibility has a central spike resulting from the component of the cross - spectrum that has a constant phase over frequency , as well as the broad distribution from the component that has a varying phase over frequency .",
    "the central spike is strongest for the shortest baseline and weaker for the next longer baselines , as expected based on the results of sections  [ sec : visibility ] and  [ sec : acf_visibility ] . at very long baselines the central spike",
    "is absent even after averaging the visibility over the whole observing period , and only the broad component is present .",
    "as expected from figure  [ fig : frrt_delay ] , in the delay / time domain the broad component appears as spikes distributed over a range of about @xmath85s in delay .",
    "these spikes keep their position in delay for the scintillation time of about 100 to 115  s , as listed in table  [ tab : scatt_params ] .",

    "they seek to reduce noise from the observing system and emission of the source , as well as variations from the finite number of scintillations sampled , while preserving the statistics of scintillation .",
    "the averages and correlation functions allow the inference of parameters of the impulse - response function of propagation from the statistics of visibility .",
    "the mean square modulus of visibility , @xmath86 , provides useful and simple characterization of visibility . to approximate the average over realizations of scattering @xmath41 , we average over many samples in time @xmath13 and over bins in delay @xmath17 .",

    "we also average over 16 lags in delay @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting average shows a broad component surrounding the origin ; on shorter baselines , it shows a spike at the origin .",
    "the broad distribution samples the properties of the fine structure seen in figures  [ fig : frrt_delay ] and [ fig : delay_fine_structure ] , and the spike to those seen on the shorter baselines in figure [ fig : delay_fine_structure ] . we argue in section  [ sec : impulse - response_visibility ] that the spike in @xmath87 is related to the average visibility , and the broad component to the impulse - response function .    figure  [ fig : cross - section_fr - dl ] shows an example of the broad component of @xmath87 .",
    "this is estimated as @xmath88 , by selecting the peak fringe rate @xmath52 to average in time for each of 6 scans , averaging the results for the scans , and averaging over 16 lags of delay to smooth the data .",

    "we obtained 22 measurements in total , with 6 samples of @xmath101 for november 26 , 28 , 29 observing sessions .",
    "we obtained only 4 such samples for november 27 because of no significant detections of @xmath7 for two scans on that date .",

    "the kernel @xmath28 is the impulse - response function ; in other words , if the pulsar emits a sharp spike , then the observed electric field of the pulse is simply a copy of @xmath28 . because of this convolution",

    "an average of the squared electric field over many impulses emitted by the source over times longer than @xmath34 will reveal the characteristic form .",
    "one simple model form for @xmath28 that includes deterministic and random parts is the product of a non - varying envelope @xmath170 , and a random function @xmath171 , that varies rapidly with @xmath30 during the course of each pulse : @xmath172 both @xmath171 and @xmath173 span a few times @xmath33 . over that time span",

    ", @xmath33 is some fraction of the width of one pulse , or a few microseconds ; whereas @xmath34 is many pulsar periods , or many seconds .",
    "such situations , where a convolution may have a slowly - varying kernel , are commonly treated as `` dynamic spectra '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the intensity received by an observer for an electric - field impulse at the source , averaged over many such impulses with different realizations of the scattering material , is the square modulus of the deterministic part of @xmath28 , which we call @xmath49 : @xmath175 here , the subscripted angular brackets @xmath176 indicate a statistical average over realizations of the scattering medium , for example as approximated by an average over pulses spanning a time greater than @xmath34 .",

    "the electric field emitted by the pulsar is the product of noise , drawn from a zero - mean gaussian distribution in the complex plane , with a more - slowly varying envelope that determines the standard deviation of the noise at each instant .",

    "<S> , we describe this phenomenon , characterize it with averages and correlation functions , and interpret it as the result of decorrelation of the impulse - response function of interstellar scattering between the widely - separated antennas . </S>",
    "<S> this instrument included the 10-m space radio telescope , the 110-m green bank telescope , the @xmath0-m westerbork synthesis radio telescope , and the 64-m kalyazin radio telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were performed at 324 mhz , on baselines of up to 235,000  km in november  2012 and january  2014 . in the delay domain , on long baselines </S>",
    "<S> the interferometric visibility consists of many discrete spikes within a limited range of delays . on short baselines </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a sharp spike surrounded by lower spikes . </S>",
    "<S> the average envelope of correlations of the visibility function show two exponential scales , with characteristic delays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , indicating the presence of two scales of scattering in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> these two scales are present in the pulse - broadening function . </S>",
    "<S> the longer scale contains 0.38 times the scattered power of the shorter one . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the longer tail arises from highly - scattered paths , possibly from anisotropic scattering or from substructure at large angles . </S>"
