    "x - ray observations of seyfert 1 nuclei have provided direct evidence for significant quantities of optically - thin photoionized gas along our line - of - sight to the central x - ray source .",
    "the first indications of such material , which has become known as the _ warm absorber _ , were found with low resolution x - ray spectroscopy of the luminous seyfert nucleus mr  2251 - 178 using _ exosat _",
    "( halpern 1984 ) .",
    "the next significant advancement came several years later when _ rosat _ pspc observations of the nearby seyfert 1 galaxy mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 revealed a broad absorption feature at @xmath1kev ( nandra & pounds 1992 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as being a blend of the photoelectric k - shell edges of ovii and oviii ( at 0.74kev and 0.87kev , respectively ) which are imprinted upon the primary x - ray spectrum when the line - of - sight to the central engine passes through the warm absorber .",
    "the ccds on board the us / japanese x - ray satellite _ asca _ provide an order of magnitude improvement in spectral resolution over the _ rosat _ pspc and allow us to study warm absorbers in detail .",
    "_ asca _ observations can separate and independently measure the properties of the ovii / oviii edges .",
    "detailed scrutiny of the _ asca _ spectra of bright seyfert 1 s can also reveal the presence of other edges and lines , although oxygen edges usually dominate .",
    "_ asca _ has shown us that approximately half of all seyfert 1 nuclei display a warm absorber ( reynolds 1997 ) .    in this contribution",
    ", i shall describe two studies that address the physical nature of the warm absorber .",
    "due to the fact that it has been most extensively observed by _",
    ", i will focus on results for the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "during performance verification observations , _ asca _ found large variations in the depths of the oxygen edges in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 ( fabian et al .",
    "1994 ; reynolds et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the timescales of this variability were found to be as short as @xmath3s . however , the physical nature of this variability was unclear . within the context of a one - zone photoionization model ( characterized by the column density @xmath4 and the ionization parameter @xmath5 ) , a drop in the primary x - ray flux was accompanied by an increase in both the column density and ionization parameter .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a situation in which the total absorber column density is correlated to the intrinsic x - ray flux on such short timescales ( reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "a long _ asca _ observation of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 resolved this confusion .",
    "figure  1 shows the intrinsic x - ray luminosity and the warm oxygen edge depths as a function of time for this observation .",
    "it can be seen that the ovii edge depth remains essentially constant whereas the oviii edge depth is strongly anti - correlated with the primary x - ray flux ( otani et al .",
    "the fact that the warm absorber variability is directly related to the primary x - ray variability is direct evidence that the warm absorber is photoionized .",
    "however , the constancy of the ovii edge is inconsistent with a one - zone absorber model . to see this",
    ", we suppose that the warm absorber can be described as a single uniform slab and note that the recombination and photoionization timescales of this material must be short in order to see any variability of the edge depths .",
    "the relative depths of the oxygen edges fixes the ionization parameter of this slab to be @xmath6 .",
    "however , for this value of @xmath5 , photoionization models clearly show that the ovii edge depth should decrease , and the oviii edge depth should increase , as the primary ionizing flux increases . this is contrary to observations .    the simplest extension of the one - zone model , a two - zone model ,",
    "can nicely account for the observed behaviour ( otani et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this model ,",
    "much of the ovii edge results from a distant , tenuous warm absorber which has a long recombination timescale and so is not seen to react to changes in the ionizing flux .",
    "spectral fitting shows this absorber to have a column density of @xmath7 , an ionization parameter of @xmath8 , and to be at a distance of @xmath9pc from the central engine .",
    "by contrast , much of the oviii edge originates from an inner warm absorber which is highly ionized and has a short recombination timescale .",
    "a drop in the ionizing flux leads to recombination of fully - stripped oxygen into oviii ions and thus an increase in the oviii edge depth .",
    "this region is constrained to have @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 cm .",
    "it is tempting to identify this component with an optically - thin component of the broad line region .",
    "it is important to account for the two - zone nature of this absorber when discussing the thermal stability of the warm material .",
    "the thermal stability of photoionized plasma to isobaric perturbations can be studied by examining the thermal equilibrium curve on the ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) plane ( mccray 1979 ; krolik , mckee and tarter 1981 ) .",
    "parts of this curve which have negative slope and are associated with a multi - valued regime correspond to thermally unstable equilibria .",
    "a one - zone model for the warm absorber implies that it is either thermally unstable or exists in extremely small pockets of stable parameter space ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ) .",
    "however , given a two - zone parameterization , the situation is rather different , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we find that the outer warm absorber can be understood as material at the extreme ( hot ) end of the stable cold branch , whereas the inner warm absorber is material at the extreme ( cold ) end of the stable intermediate / hot branch .",
    "whilst the exact form of this curve is sensitive to the ionizing continuum shape assumed , it is clear that the two - zone nature of the absorber must be accounted for in any discussion of thermal stability .",
    "whilst reporting the results of the first optical spectroscopy of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 , pineda et al .",
    "( 1980 ) noted that the x - ray spectrum does _ not _ display the neutral absorption expected on the basis of its optical reddening .",
    "this issue has recently been investigated in more detail by reynolds et al .",
    "both the optical emission line spectrum and the continuum form suggest that this seyfert nucleus is reddened by @xmath15 or more . assuming a standard lmc extinction law and using a galactic dust / gas ratio implies that a gas column of at least @xmath16 should accompany this reddening",
    ". however , x - ray spectroscopy with both _ asca _ and _ rosat _ can set stringent limits on the cold ( i.e. , neutral ) gas column of @xmath17 .    a similar situation has been found for the quasar iras  13349 + 2438 ( brandt et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this object",
    ", spectropolarimetry reveals a heavily reddened direct continuum and an unreddened scattered component ( wills et al .",
    "x - ray observations reveal a variable x - ray source ( indicating that we are viewing the x - ray source directly , rather than through scattered flux ) with a warm absorber but no detectable neutral absorption .",
    "the x - ray upper limits on the neutral column are an order of magnitude lower than that expected on the basis of the reddening ( brandt et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "since the x - ray flux is thought to originate from deeper within the central engine than the optical flux , this discrepancy is difficult to understand as a purely geometric effect .",
    "a dust / gas ratio which is 10 times the galactic value would reconcile these studies , but is difficult to understand physically ( we might expect dust grains to be preferentially destroyed near an agn , but not preferentially created ) .",
    "the most reasonable resolution of this problem is that the dust responsible for the optical reddening resides in the warm absorber . in both mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 and iras  13349 + 2438 ,",
    "the inferred dust / warm - gas ratio is similar to the galactic dust / cold - gas ratio . in other words",
    ", the warm absorber appears to represent galactic - like dusty gas that has been ionized with little destruction of the dust grains .    under the conditions envisaged ,",
    "the dust grains are thermally decoupled from the relatively tenuous gas .",
    "they come into a thermal equilibrium such that the thermal radiation emitted by each grain balances the incident agn flux on that grain .",
    "grains can survive provided two conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , the grains must be sufficiently far from the central engine so that they do not sublime . in the case of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15",
    ", this translates into a distance limit of @xmath18 cm and suggests that it is the outer warm absorber , as opposed to the inner warm absorber , which is dusty .",
    "secondly , the gas temperature can not exceed @xmath19k or else the grains would be destroyed via thermal sputtering .",
    "this is easily satisfied if the warm absorber is photoionized rather than collisionally ionized .",
    "this dust may be responsible for a significant part of the infra - red bump seen in the broad - band spectrum of many seyfert nuclei .",
    "two studies relevant to the physical nature of the warm absorber have been described . to summarize the results of these investigations :    1 .",
    "the temporal variability of the warm absorber in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 as seen by _ asca _ suggests that it is comprised of at least two zones .",
    "the inner zone may be related to the broad line region whereas the outer zone is at radii characteristic of the putative molecular torus and the narrow line region .",
    "the absence of neutral absorption , which is naively expected to accompany the optical reddening in both mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 and iras  13349 + 2438 , suggests that the warm absorber may be dusty . in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 ,",
    "this dust must lie in the outer warm absorber or else it would be sublimated by the intense agn radiation field .",
    "i am indebted to andy fabian , chiko otani and martin ward with whom much of this work was performed in collaboration .",
    "this work was supported by a pparc ( uk ) studentship and the national science foundation under grant ast-9529175 .",
    "c.  reynolds mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 shows a fairly clean pattern of variability  the ovii edge remains essentially constant whilst only the oviii edge varies . in this case",
    "we can decouple the two zones quite easily . in a more general case ( i.e.",
    ", both oxygen edges varying ) it is rather more difficult",
    ". this may be the case in some other seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  3227 ) in which a complex pattern of warm absorber variability is seen .      c.  reynolds not much is known .",
    "_ iue _ shows it to be a rather faint uv source and i m not aware of a _ hst _ uv spectrum of this object . to my knowledge ,",
    "the only uv feature that has definitely been detected is the civ@xmath20 line ( even the continuum is barely detected ) .",
    "this is all consistent with it being heavily reddened .      c.  reynolds as the x - ray flux is seen to enter a low state , the warm absorber is seen to change in the manner i described , and the iron line is seen to get broader and stronger .",
    "however , the iron line is thought to originate from the innermost regions of the accretion flow and so is probably not directly related to any changes in the warm absorber .",
    "_ asca _ does not detect any iron edge , but the constraints are nt very strong due to the limited sensitivity of _ asca _ at energies above the iron line .",
