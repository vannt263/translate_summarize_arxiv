    "partial wave analysis(pwa ) now is widely used in physics analysis of high energy experimental physics . as an effective method , by analyzing information of final state particles ,",

    "the centrifugal barrier effects are considered .",
    "it is known that , after a resonance decays into final state particles , the outward - going wave is being reflected inward by the centrifugal barrier .",
    "therefore , the radial probability density at infinity is the centrifugal barrier factor @xmath0 times the radial probability density at the interaction radius @xmath1 .",
    "+ the centrifugal barrier effects are studied in literatures @xcite .",
    "basic results of the papers are that the shape and the partial decay width of a resonance are affected by the centrifugal barrier effects .",
    "the centrifugal barrier factor @xmath2 has two parameters , the orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath3 and the interaction radius @xmath1 .",
    "it shows that the interaction radii range from 0.25 to 0.75 f for the meson resonance decays and from 0.1 to 1 f for the baryon decays .",
    "+ it is conventionally believed that the influence of the centrifugal barrier effects to physics analysis is small .",
    "therefore , the centrifugal barrier effects are not considered in some physics analysis , which corresponds to the case that @xmath4 or @xmath5 . in partial wave analysis ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier effects are considered , but the interaction radius @xmath1 is set to 1 f for all resonances@xcite . in this paper , the influence of the centrifugal barrier effects to physics analysis is studied , and a method is proposed to measure the interaction radius in physics analysis .",
    "first , the decay amplitude used in the physics analysis is given .",
    "then , the problem that how the resonance s line shape is affected by the centrifugal barrier effects is studied . finally , we will discuss how to measure the interaction radius in a pwa fit .",
    "let s consider a two body decay @xmath6.in the center of mass system of the mother particle @xmath7 , the magnitude of the momentum of the particle @xmath8 is @xmath9 , and the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the daughter particle system is @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that the interaction potential @xmath11 is almost zero when @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the interaction radius of the mother particle @xmath7 .",
    "the wave equation which holds outside the interaction radius @xmath13 is [ 01 ] r  + r + ( k^2 - ) r = 0 , where @xmath1 is the radial wave function , and @xmath14 is the semiclassical impact parameter .",

    "it could be seen that the shapes of these curves change greatly when the momentum @xmath9 is in the region 0 - 2 gev , which is just in the momentum region of final state particles produced in the decays of most mesons or hadrons .",
    "different shapes of barrier factors give out different line shapes of resonances .",
    "if the centrifugal barrier effects are not correctly considered , the line shape of a resonance given by it will be quite different from the one with the centrifugal barrier factors correctly considered , which will cause large errors in the measurement of mass , width and branching ratio of a resonance . if the momentum of the daughter particle in the center of mass system of the mother particle is greater than 3 gev , the influence of the centrifugal barrier effects to such kind of decay will be small . in this case",
    ", the mass of mother particle must be greater than 6 gev .",
