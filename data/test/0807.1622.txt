    "the recent experimental developments in ultracold fermi gases and in particular the experimental realization of the bec - bcs crossover through feshbach resonance @xcite have arised in a field where theoretical investigations started a long time ago . indeed fairly soon after the publication of the bardeen - cooper - shrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite , the extension to the neutral fermi liquid @xmath4he",
    "was considered @xcite .",
    "although the case of liquid @xmath4he is more complex than the one of ultracold gases , it is nevertheless analogous to the situation found on the bcs side of the crossover , in the strong interaction regime .",
    "similarly the possibility of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of composite bosons was considered quite early for excitons in semiconductors @xcite , where the composite nature of these bosons is expected to be an essential physical feature .",
    "this is the situation met in the bec range of the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "deep theoretical investigation of this last situation was made not long afterwards by keldysh and kozlov @xcite , following a seminal work by popov @xcite which considered a physical model with short range potentials , much closer to the ultracold gas case . in both cases , due to the formal similarity between the bogoliubov and the bcs frameworks , the theoretical treatment relied on the fact that in the dilute limit the formalism leads directly to the schrdinger equation for the molecular state corresponding to the composite boson .",
    "this provided an anticipation of the study of the whole bec - bcs crossover .",
    "independently eagles @xcite , in the course of a study of superconductivity in doped semiconductors ( where the electron gas has a low concentration compared to standard metals ) , was led to investigate the extrapolation of the simple bcs formalism toward the dilute regime where pair formation would take place , due to the attractive interaction , and bose condensation of these pairs should occur at lower temperatures .    in the context of cold gases ,",
    "the physics of the crossover was considered by leggett @xcite , who stressed the physical interest of considering cooper pairs as giant molecules , emphasized the change of physical regime when the chemical potential goes through zero , and introduced the scattering length in the bcs formulation .",
    "the matter was taken up by nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite who studied the smooth evolution of the critical temperature in the crossover within the simplest @xmath5matrix approximation , showing in particular how the critical temperature of the ideal bose gas is recovered in the strong coupling limit .",
    "s de melo , randeria and engelbrecht @xcite addressed the crossover with the functional integral formalism .",
    "as it has often been stressed , the physical situation found in this bec - bcs crossover is extremely interesting since ( at least for wide feshbach resonances @xcite ) the scattering length @xmath6 of the different fermions with mass @xmath7 is enough to fully describe their interaction , while one has still to deal with the full complexity of a strongly interacting system . as a result",
    "the theoretical problem has not been solved exactly and one has to rely on various approximate schemes @xcite , the simplest one being the straight bcs formalism ( often called bcs - mf ) which is known to give a correct description at zero temperature in both the extreme bec and bcs limits @xmath8 .",
    "the imperfections of the approximate treatments are clearer in the bec regime",
    ". indeed if one wants to describe properly the departure from the ideal bose gas of dimers , one has to provide a correct description of the dimer - dimer interaction , in order to find the expected physics of a weakly interacting bose gas . as stressed by keldysh and kozlov @xcite the composite nature of the dimers",
    "has already to be properly taken into account at this stage in order to obtain correct results .    a first step in this direction for the specific case of short range interactions , relevant for cold gases , was made by haussmann @xcite who obtained , both in the normal and in the superfluid state ( where this can be found naturally out of the bcs ansatz ) , that the dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath1 is related to the fermion scattering length @xmath6 by @xmath9 .",
    "this result was also obtained in ref.@xcite in the superfluid state by other methods .",
    "the level of approximation corresponding to this result turns out to be the born approximation for the dimer - dimer scattering . at the same level of approximation pieri and",
    "strinati @xcite derived quite recently the gross - pitaevskii equation from the bogoliubov - de gennes equations . however",
    "this level of approximation was markedly improved by pieri and strinati @xcite who performed the calculation at the level of a @xmath5matrix approximation and found @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless their calculation does not include all the processes resulting from the existence of the fermions making up these composite bosons .",
    "the exact numerical result was obtained recently by petrov , salomon and shlyapnikov @xcite who basically solved the relevant schrdinger equation for the four - body problem and found for this dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath11 .",
    "thereafter it was shown @xcite how this same problem could be exactly formulated and solved within the methods of quantum field theory , with naturally exactly the same result .",
    "this last work is quite relevant to the present paper , and represents the basis out of which we will work .",
    "this is naturally linked to the fact that field theoretic methods are a convenient , and probably necessary , framework for an exact formulation and solution of this superfluid strong coupling problem raised by the bec - bcs crossover .    in this paper , we provide an exact approach to the bec - bcs crossover problem from the bec side by presenting an exact fermionic theory of a bec superfluid of composite bosons in the low density range .",
    "the two interacting fermion species we deal with are actually the two lowest energy hyperfine states used experimentally @xcite in ultracold gases of @xmath12li or @xmath13k , and as it is usually done we will for convenience refer to them as `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' states . specifically working in the low density range",
    "means that we proceed basically to an expansion in powers of the gas density .",
    "otherwise our framework is completely general . in the present paper we deal with the lower orders in this expansion , but",
    "nothing in principle prevents our approach to be extended to higher orders , although admittedly this will require much more work .",
    "similarly we will restrict ourselves to the @xmath14 situation , which brings strong simplifications as we will see because in this case there are no fermions at all in the normal state .",
    "however it is quite possible to extend our approach to non zero temperature .",
    "finally we deal here with thermodynamics , but our framework allows us naturally to calculate dynamical quantities .    as we mentionned",
    "our approach is in principle a low density expansion .",
    "however the density @xmath0 is not a convenient basic parameter since it rather appears in the formalism as the result of a calculation . on the other hand",
    "it is known ( and we will see it explicitely below ) that in the simple bcs approximation for the bec limit , which as mentionned above corresponds to a born approximation at the level of the mean field term , the density @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the gap parameter of the bcs theory . hence a convenient way to proceed effectively to a low density expansion is rather to expand in powers of @xmath16 .",
    "however this quantity is specific of the bcs approximation , which has no general validity .",
    "but it is directly related to the anomalous self - energy @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is an energy - momentum four - vector ) which is a completely general microscopic quantity characteristic of a superfluid system .",
    "hence our method will specifically be an expansion of the general equations in powers of the anomalous self - energy @xmath17 .    here",
    "we will calculate the equation of state , or more precisely the dependence of the chemical potential @xmath19 on the density @xmath0 ( a short account of our calculation has already been published @xcite ) .",
    "actually this is rather the reciprocal of this function which comes naturally out of the calculation , since @xmath19 enters the green s functions while @xmath0 is obtained at the end of the calculation , after elimination of @xmath17 which comes in the intermediate steps .",
    "the lowest order term in the expression of @xmath19 , beyond the trivial term of half the molecular binding energy @xmath20 , is the mean - field term .",
    "one has to note that , even at this stage , the composite nature of the bosons we deal with is entering as noted by keldysh and kozlov @xcite .",
    "however in our case it is lumped into the full dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "this result is physically natural since , beyond the zeroth order term @xmath20 in the chemical potential @xcite corresponding to an isolated molecule , we expect in a density expansion to find the physics of two coexisting molecules , which should be fully describable by @xmath1 for its static properties , corresponding to the zero energy scattering properties . nevertheless , as far as we know",
    ", this quite reasonable result has always been in the literature more or less taken for granted or cursorily obtained , but not fully explicitely derived from a microscopic theory for composite bosons .",
    "hence our first step will be to obtain this fully explicit derivation .",
    "however we are naturally essentially interested by the next order term , at which we will also limit our present calculation . from the theory of weakly interacting elementary bosons this term is proportional to @xmath2 , as first obtained by lee and yang @xcite .",
    "we refer to this term as the lhy term",
    ". this term has then been rederived by beliaev @xcite making use of field theoretic methods .",
    "naturally it is reasonable to expect that a similar term arises for composite bosons .",
    "what is however less clear is that the coefficient is just the same as for elementary bosons , i.e. that it can be simply expressed in the same way in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed it is clear that , at some stage in the expansion , the composite nature of the bosons will enter by other quantities than those describing the physics of elementary bosons .",
    "this is quite obvious physically since , by going to higher densities ( which corresponds to take into account higher order terms in the expansion ) , we will go toward unitarity and find physical properties linked to the existence of fermi seas .",
    "obviously this can not be obtained from the physics of elementary bosons .",
    "hence it is conceivable that additional processes contribute to the @xmath2 term for composite bosons .",
    "nevertheless we will find at the end of our paper that the @xmath2 term is indeed identical to the lhy term provided the dimer - dimer scattering length is used .",
    "the fact that this is not obvious is immediately realized from the number and the complexity of our steps , which do not map systematically on the elementary boson derivation .",
    "on the other hand this result makes sense physically when it is realized that the lhy term is directly linked to the existence of the gapless collective mode .",
    "a standard perturbation expansion should produce a @xmath3 term as the next term after the mean - field one .",
    "the existence of the lhy term is linked to the presence of these gapless elementary excitations which produce a singularity in the expansion , leading formally to a divergence in the coefficient of the @xmath3 term . obtaining the proper result",
    "is equivalent to the resummation of a partial series to all order in perturbations in order to get rid of the singularity .",
    "since these steps involve only low energies , they do not test the internal structure of the bosons which comes into play when energies of order of the binding energy @xmath21 are involved .",
    "in such a case it is reasonable that no difference appears between elementary and composite bosons . on the other hand the calculation of the coefficient of the regular @xmath3 term in the expansion involves the consideration of energies of order of the binding energy , as we will see explicitely , making explicit the composite nature of the bosons .",
    "this implies that at the level of this term one finds a result different from the case of elementary bosons .",
    "note that this result has been previously assumed to be correct in calculations of collective mode frequencies @xcite .",
    "on one hand this was in agreement with monte - carlo calculations @xcite , and on the other hand this has been supported by very recent experiments @xcite .",
    "at the level of handling the collective mode , very strong analogies with a purely bosonic approach , in particular with beliaev s work @xcite will appear for obvious physical reasons , although it can be seen that our treatment bypasses a good deal of beliaev s detailed diagrammatic analysis . we will not try to put these analogies away , but rather make use of these similarities and correspondances to make easier the physical and technical understanding of our calculation .",
    "however we will never make an actual use of a bosonic approach and all our theory is a purely fermionic theory , the essential physical feature being that we deal with fermion physics but with negative chemical potential @xmath22 .",
    "in particular we often use the word dimer to describe two fermions with spin up and spin down .",
    "but since the theory contains , in the corresponding propagator , not only the bound state of these fermions but also the scattering states , it should be taken as a simple convenient wording , although it is naturally physically suggestive .",
    "more generally and formally the anomalous self - energies @xmath23 and @xmath24 play clearly a role analogous to @xmath25 and @xmath26 for bosonic superfluidity .",
    "our paper is organized according to the above introduction . after introducing briefly the general formalism in the next section [ general ] ,",
    "we proceed to the calculation of the normal and anomalous self - energies in section [ deltexp ] to lowest order in @xmath17 , which leads us to the mean field term in the expression of the chemical potential .",
    "then in section [ collmod ] we proceed to discuss the collective mode which plays an essential role in the calculation of the lhy term .",
    "then the calculation of the contribution of this collective mode to the normal and anomalous self - energies is performed in section [ sigcollmod ] , at the end of which the lhy contribution to the chemical potential is obtained .",
    "a number of technical details are treated in appendices , to try to make more palatable the main part of this paper which is already fairly heavy .",
    "our work deals only with the @xmath14 situation .",
    "hence it would be most natural to use the standard @xmath14 green s function formalism and naturally all the content of our paper can be reproduced with this formalism .",
    "however one has in this case to be careful in dealing with real frequencies , and specify precisely the location , with respect to the real axis , of singularities in the corresponding complex plane .",
    "this is often left implicit . a simple way to clarify",
    "this question is to deal with complex frequencies .",
    "but this is actually what one has to do naturally when one works at @xmath27 , where the frequencies run on the imaginary frequency axis . in the @xmath28",
    "limit the discrete sums over matsubara frequencies turn into integrals over frequencies running on the imaginary axis ( the link with the @xmath14 formalism is merely obtained by continuing analytically the frequencies toward the real frequency axis , that is performing a so - called wick rotation on the frequency ) .",
    "this leads to somewhat clearer results . hence , despite its somewhat artificial character , we will work quite specifically with this @xmath14 limit of the @xmath27 formalism .",
    "actually this will not appear in many our expressions because of their formal nature and for this reason it does not make any real problem .",
    "the essential point is that , in this way , we will always have perfectly regular expressions , with an effective handling which is quite clear and easy .",
    "we deal only with the formalism of fermionic superfluidity , as it is known in superconductivity @xcite and superfluid @xmath4he @xcite .",
    "this entails the use of both the normal fermionic green s functions @xmath29 , where we make use of the four - vector notation @xmath30 , and their anomalous counterpart @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where we make use of standard notations @xcite .",
    "this could be written in a compact nambu formalism , but for clarity we prefer to write the normal and anomalous parts explicitely , with slightly different sign conventions . in practice",
    "we will always consider in the following , when we calculate @xmath33 , that we deal with @xmath34 , without writing it explicitely for simplicity .",
    "the existence ( i.e. the fact that they are non zero ) of these anomalous green s function is the basic ingredient of fermionic superfluidity in our formalism .",
    "this is quite clear physically since they are related to the condensate .",
    ", [ eqdysona]),width=377 ]    we start by writing dyson s equations for this superfluid : @xmath35 their corresponding diagrammatic representation being given in fig .",
    "[ figdyson ] .",
    "here @xmath36^{-1}$ ] is the free atom green s function , with @xmath37 the atom kinetic energy @xmath38 measured from the chemical potential @xmath19 .",
    "the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath17 are respectively the normal and the anomalous self - energies . by definition @xmath39",
    "is the sum of all diagrams , with one entering @xmath18 line and one outgoing @xmath18 line , which can not separated into two disconnected parts by cutting a single @xmath40 line ( or @xmath41 line ) .",
    "@xmath17 has the same definition except that it has two entering lines , one ( @xmath42 ) line and one ( @xmath43 ) line .",
    "we note that @xmath17 depends naturally in the general case on momentum and frequency . in the second equation , for @xmath32 which begins with an outgoing ( @xmath43 ) line and",
    "finishes with an outgoing ( @xmath42 ) line , it would look more symmetrical to introduce a corresponding anomalous self - energy @xmath44 , analogous to @xmath17 , but with two outgoing lines , one ( @xmath45 ) line and one ( @xmath46 ) line .",
    "however it can be related directly to @xmath47 by time reversal , as we have written explicitely .",
    "all formulae in the following turn out to be simpler to interpret when this substitution is done , and we will follow this standard habit .",
    "we note also that , since we deal with an equilibrium situation , where the gas is homogeneous , we do not need to introduce green s functions with different entering and outgoing momenta , as it would be required in the case of an inhomogeneous system .",
    "dyson s equations eq .",
    "( [ eqdyson ] ) can be understood as a way of ordering the full perturbation expansion , by gathering terms into @xmath39 and @xmath17 .",
    "however it is interesting to note that this can be done in slightly different ways .",
    "for example we can gather in eq .",
    "( [ eqdyson ] ) all the terms where only the free green s function @xmath40 and the normal self - energy @xmath39 appear , that is the terms where no anomalous terms are present .",
    "this leads to introduce @xmath48 , that is @xmath49 .",
    "in this way , by making use of @xmath50 instead of @xmath40 , we are only left to write in dyson s equations the anomalous terms , that is to rewrite these equations as : @xmath51 it is indeed checked easily that the algebraic solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqdyson],[eqdysona ] ) , as well as the one of eq .",
    "( [ eqdyson1 ] , [ eqdyson1a ] ) , is indeed : @xmath52 making use of the expression of @xmath53 this can be rewritten as : @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result could have been obtained directly in the following way . in the definition",
    "we have taken above for the self - energy , we had excluded diagrams made of two blocks linked by a single propagator @xmath40 ( corresponding to an atom propagating to the right , as for the definition of the normal self - energy ) or @xmath41 ( corresponding to an atom propagating to the left , as it is produced by the anomalous self - energies ) .",
    "however we could take another definition where we would exclude only blocks linked by a rightward propagator , just as in the normal state . in this case the formal expression of @xmath33 in terms of the self - energy , i.e. @xmath55 , is just the same as in the normal state , as it is indeed the case in eq .",
    "( [ eqdysonsol1 ] ) .",
    "but the expression of the self - energy has been naturally modified from @xmath39 to @xmath56 .",
    "indeed we have to include now terms containing leftward propagators @xmath41 .",
    "but it is easily realized that these new terms contain at most a product @xmath57 , corresponding to the presence of anomalous self - energies of opposite types at the extremities of the block .",
    "these two anomalous self - energies can be separated by any number of leftward propagators @xmath41 , with normal self - energies @xmath58 .",
    "the sum of all these produces a factor @xmath59 , which leads to the relation : @xmath60 in agreeement with eq .",
    "( [ eqdysonsol1 ] ) .",
    "while they are completely general , the considerations presented in the preceding section are not of much practical use since we have no expressions for the normal and anomalous self - energies . in order to obtain explicit expressions",
    ", we will now begin to proceed along the lines outlined in the introduction , namely to perform a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath16 . in the present section , as an introduction and as a first step , we will only consider the lowest order in this expansion .",
    "the next order will then be addressed in the next section . in the first subsection we will consider the expansion of the normal self - energy , which turns out to be the easier one .",
    "then the anomalous self - energy will be handled along the same lines .      as we have indicated in the introduction , and as we will check explicitely below",
    ", the expansion in powers of @xmath16 has the character of an expansion in powers of the density @xmath0 since we will find @xmath62 .",
    "hence the zeroth order in powers of @xmath16 corresponds to an infinitely dilute gas for which the normal self - energy is naturally zero .",
    "since by its definition this normal self - energy contains only processes which conserve globally the number of particles , the lowest order term @xmath63 in the normal self - energy must contain both @xmath16 and @xmath64 , because @xmath16 implies from its definition the annihilation of two atoms ( going physically in the condensate ) , while @xmath64 corresponds to the creation of two atoms ( coming out of the condensate ) . hence this lowest order term in the normal self - energy",
    "is the sum of all diagrams which contain @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and which have one entering line @xmath18 and one outgoing line @xmath18 , the rest of the diagrams containing only ( since we proceed to an expansion ) @xmath67 quantities , that is normal state quantities ( see fig . [ figt3 ] ) .",
    "we call the sum of all these normal state diagrams the normal part of @xmath63 .",
    "this is just @xmath63 , except for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 terms .",
    ", width=226 ]    explicitely this means that this normal part of the diagrams contains only any number of bare propagators @xmath40 and of interactions lines .",
    "moreover the two atom lines coming out of @xmath66(with opposite spins ) are not allowed to interact immediately after entering the normal part of the diagram , since such an interaction is already included in @xmath66 ( as we will see explicitely below ) and allowing it would amount to double counting of diagrams . similarly the two atom lines entering @xmath65 are not allowed to interact immediately before . as it happens , such a normal state set of diagrams has already been essentially considered in ref.@xcite . indeed in this paper",
    "the scattering of a single atom by a dimer ( made of atoms with opposite spins ) has been calculated .",
    "the fact that a dimer is entering the diagram implied that the two corresponding atom lines can not interact immediately in the diagram , since such an interaction is already taken into account in the dimer propagator and this would be again double counting .",
    "there is a similar requirement for the two lines corresponding to the outgoing dimer .",
    "we see that the requirements on the normal part of @xmath63 are just the same as in the above paper . in this ref.@xcite",
    "the sum of all these diagrams was denoted @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( respectively @xmath70 ) is the four - vector of the entering ( respectively outgoing ) atom , and @xmath71 is the total four - vector of the single atom and the dimer . in our statement",
    "we apparently overlook the fact that @xmath68 contains only three atom lines , which go from the beginning to the end of the diagram , with various interactions between them in the diagram , since we deal with the vacuum scattering of an atom and a dimer .",
    "in contrast we could think that , in addition to these lines , the normal part of @xmath63 may contain any number of loops of atom lines .",
    "however it is clear physically that these loops are not allowed . indeed",
    "if we think of this normal part as representing , in a time representation , a succession of processes due to interaction , the appearance of a loop corresponds to the creation of a particle - hole pair . while such processes can always occur at non zero temperature , in our @xmath14 situation they are possible only if the chemical potential @xmath19 is positive , thereby allowing the existence of a fermi sea in which the hole can be created .",
    "but in our dilute regime we have @xmath72 and these processes are forbidden",
    ". this argument is developped more technically in appendix [ appnoloop ] .",
    "hence it is correct to identify the normal part of @xmath63 with @xmath73 since both contain only three atom lines , subject to the same restrictions indicated above .",
    "nevertheless there is still a small difference in the general case between the normal part we want and @xmath73 . in the definition of @xmath73 one has to sum over all possible four - vectors for the two lines making up the entering dimer , with the only restriction that their sum is fixed at @xmath74 .",
    "a similar summation applies for the two lines making up the outgoing dimer .",
    "on the other hand in our normal part the two lines ( p,@xmath75 ) and ( -p,@xmath76 ) entering in @xmath65 have a total zero four - vector , and because @xmath65 depends on @xmath77 , when we sum over @xmath77 , there is a weight @xmath65 which depends on @xmath77 , in contrast with the case of @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in appendix [ appt3 ] , it is possible to express in the general case our self - energy in terms of @xmath73 .",
    "but in our specific problem , this is an unnecessary complication since we will see that , at the order of the expansion we are considering , the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath77 can be neglected , and @xmath65 can be considered as a constant which we denote merely as @xmath16 . hence we can factor @xmath61 out .",
    "similar considerations apply to @xmath78 and the entering dimer lines .",
    "there is still a very important point to consider before writing our expression for @xmath63 . among all the diagrams we have considered contributing to @xmath63",
    ", there is necessarily a diagram which gives a contribution @xmath79 because it satisfies all our requirements .",
    "indeed this is just what is coming from the lowest order diagram in @xmath73 , which gives a contribution @xmath80 to @xmath73 and corresponds merely to the born approximation .",
    "this diagram is necessarily present because we considered it already in the preceding section [ general ] , when we were dealing with the general expansion of @xmath33 in powers of @xmath81 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is just the last term in eq.([eqdysonsol1 ] ) , when we replace @xmath59 by @xmath41 ( since we want only normal state diagrams ) and take @xmath17 independent of @xmath18 .",
    "however , since it is already explicitely present in eq.([eqdysonsol1 ] ) , this implies automatically that it is reducible ( and indeed it is obviously reducible ) and for this reason should not be included in @xmath63 ( otherwise we would double count this diagram ) . on the other hand",
    "this is clearly the only reducible contribution coming from @xmath73 , as seen directly from the diagrammatic expansion @xcite of @xmath73 , or because any such reducible contribution has to appear explicitely from eq.([eqdysonsol1 ] ) as explained above .",
    "accordingly we have to subtract this contribution out and we obtain finally : @xmath82 we can also rewrite this result in terms of our self - energy @xmath83 as : @xmath84 this result is also directly quite natural since , when we evaluate @xmath83 , the diagrams with @xmath41 are not considered as reducible , as we have seen , and accordingly @xmath79 should not be subtracted .",
    "we are now in position to calculate the single spin atomic density @xmath0 , which is given quite generally by : @xmath85 if @xmath86 is replaced by @xmath87 , one checks easily that @xmath88 , which is physically obvious since in this case we deal with a non interacting fermion gas , at @xmath14 , and chemical potential @xmath22 .",

    "this seems physically reasonable since , in eq .",
    "( [ eqdefn1 ] ) , @xmath73 describes the scattering of an atom with the condensate which has clearly to be taken into account .",
    "however the actual situation turns out to be much simpler . in order to calculate the integral over @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eqdefn1 ] ) , it is convenient to close the contour in the upper complex half - plane @xmath97 ( which corresponds to @xmath98 ) , since the pole of @xmath99^{-1}$ ] is found for @xmath100 ( since @xmath101 ) .",
    "however it is shown in appendix [ appt3anal ] that , except for the born contribution , @xmath102 is analytical in the upper complex half - plane and does not contribute to the integral .",
    "the result comes entirely from the born contribution .",
    "this means that surprisingly the contribution of @xmath63 to @xmath0 is zero , and that the only non zero contribution comes from the explicit bcs term @xmath103 in eq .",

    "since the lhy terms come physically from the low energy collective mode , we need first to derive the expression for the collective mode propagator , as well as its anomalous counterpart .",

    "this is also more natural physically since we are interested in particular in the ( real ) frequency of the collective mode .",

    "note that physically this propagator describes the bound state of the two fermions , through its pole at @xmath212 , as well as the continuum of scattering states where the dimer is broken , through the continuum in the spectral function starting at @xmath213 .        in the superfluid we want to obtain the correction to this normal state result to lowest order in @xmath214 .",
    "more precisely we want to correct what corresponds to the self - energy if we had a single particle propagator . in the present case",
    "this is the irreducible vertex in the particle - particle channel , which by definition can not be separated in two disconnected parts by cutting two fermion propagators .",
    "more precisely , since the bare interaction between fermions is already taken into account in @xmath108 , this is the part of this irreducible vertex beyond the bare interaction we are interested in .",
    "this part @xmath215 of the irreducible vertex depends on the quadrivectors @xmath123 and @xmath124 of the entering particles , as well as on those @xmath216 and @xmath217 of the outgoing particles .",

    "however we had also to write the second sum , which describes the anomalous processes where a dimer can be annihilated into the condensate or can be created from the condensate .",
    "this leads to introduce , in correspondance with the first sum , an anomalous irreducible vertex @xmath223 where four fermions are entering ( annihilated into the condensate ) and none is going out . correspondingly we need to introduce an anomalous full vertex @xmath224 with only outgoing fermion lines . naturally in order to close our set of equations we have to write for this vertex the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation , which is shown diagrammatically in fig .",

    "since we have already found that @xmath267 , we can easily check that eq.([moddisp ] ) is indeed satisfied in this case .",
    "now , as we will see , we are more specifically interested in the collective mode dispersion relation for wave vectors @xmath268 and frequencies @xmath269 .",
    "since @xmath270 and @xmath271 are of the same order of magnitude , we can expand the bare dimer propagator to first order as : @xmath272 on the other hand the typical scale of variation of @xmath192 on its arguments is @xmath188 for the wave vectors and @xmath270 for the energies , since we deal with a normal state quantity and there are accordingly no other scales in the corresponding problem .",
    "hence , for the wave vectors and frequencies we are considering , we can still take : @xmath273 on the other hand the above result at @xmath261 implies also that we have @xmath274 , and eq . ( [ moddisp ] ) for the collective mode frequency @xmath275",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath276 where we have set @xmath277 and in the last step we have used the lowest order expressions for @xmath278 and @xmath214 to calculate this quantity . naturally eq.([bog ] ) is just the bogoliubov dispersion relation , with the proper scattering dimer - dimer scattering length .",
    "as we have already indicated in the introduction , the lhy term arises from the collective mode contributions to the self - energies .",
    "if we were to continue naturally our above procedure and go to next order in @xmath16 , i.e. to order @xmath279 for example in the calculation of the normal self - energy , we would find singular results ( as it can be checked by proceeding to such a formal expansion in the explicit calculations performed below ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the collective mode is gapless , and the lack of gap in the excitation spectrum leads to a singularity in the perturbative expansion .",
    "hence , instead of the next order terms , we include the whole contribution coming from the collective mode . avoiding in this way to proceed immediately to a @xmath16 expansion",
    "is equivalent to a series resummation , which allows to take care of singularities .",
    "writing the collective mode contributions to the self - energy is formally easy , when one notices for example the analogy of the normal part of the collective mode propagator with the product of @xmath64 and @xmath16 .",
    "indeed the term @xmath64 acts as a source of fermions in our diagrams , coming physically out of the condensate , while @xmath16 acts as a sink of fermions going into the condensate . these source and sink related to the condensate are required since , at @xmath280 , no fermions are present except coming from the superfluid .",
    "however when we allow to insert the normal part of a collective mode propagator , the starting part of the propagator acts as a sink for the rest of the diagram while the end part acts as a source .",
    "hence we have just to substitute @xmath244 by the normal part of a collective mode propagator",
    ". we will proceed in a similar way for the anomalous parts .",
    "naturally we will have to take care that the self - energy contributions already calculated above are not counted twice , by removing the corresponding terms .",

    "we have naturally to sum over the variable @xmath71 of the collective mode .",

    "for the zeroth order term , this is fairly obvious physically since it corresponds to a normal state diagram with a normal state dimer propagator , and at @xmath14 no dimers are present which makes all diagrams of this kind equal to zero .",
    "mathematically this would happen because , in this diagram , the presence of a normal state dimer would necessarily imply , since there is no down - spin entering line , the presence of a down - spin loop ( if we calculate the up - spin self - energy ) which can not be present as explained in appendix [ appnoloop ] .     in the collective mode contribution to the normal self - energy eq.([eqsigmod ] ) depicted in fig.[figxab],width=226 ]",
    "the conclusion is the same for the first order term , but the argument is slightly more complicated .",
    "the factor of @xmath214 in this term is @xmath284 ^ 2t_4(p/2,p/2;p/2)$ ] , which is a normal state diagram ( see fig.[figaaaa ] ) .",
    "it is actually a part of the diagrams belonging to @xmath102 since it has one entering fermion line and one entering dimer line , with the same for the outgoing lines .",
    "however we have seen , as it is detailed in appendix [ appt3anal ] , that only the born term in @xmath73 gives a non zero contribution to the particle number . on the other hand the term @xmath284",
    "^ 2t_4(p/2,p/2;p/2)$ ] does obviously not contain the born term of @xmath73 since this last one reduces to a simple propagator , whereas the presence of the factor @xmath108 implies at least two lines , with interaction between them .",
    "actually one can see more precisely that our term is equal to zero , since it contains necessarily propagators going backward in time ( see appendix [ appnoloop ] and [ appt3anal ] ) .",
    "taking the born contribution for @xmath73 and @xmath192 in @xmath284 ^ 2t_4(p/2,p/2;p/2)$ ] gives a good example of this .",
    "finally , after these considerations , we see that we can still use eq.([eqsigmod ] ) for @xmath285",
    ". the conclusion will be different for the mode contribution to the anomalous self - energy discussed below .",

    "quite similarly it will be enough to replace here @xmath33 by @xmath40 to obtain the lowest order contribution of the collective mode we are interested in .",

    "we have first considered the contribution of the low frequency singularities .",
    "we have now to finish up by showing that the higher frequency ones give a negligible contribution .",

    "hence we are again left with the evaluation of @xmath311 .",

    "the integration is now over the imaginary @xmath313 axis and is closed in the negative @xmath313 half - plane .",
    "the contour can be deformed to merely enclose the negative @xmath313 axis , and corresponding to the singularities on this axis , @xmath314 has a jump across this axis .",
    "hence we have : @xmath315 now , from eq.([gamn ] ) , @xmath316 contains a first term @xmath317 which has all its singularities on the real positive @xmath313 axis , corresponding to the continuous spectrum of the broken dimer ( for @xmath108 ) and of the broken pair of dimers ( for @xmath318 ) .",
    "hence it is real on the negative @xmath313 axis and does not contribute to @xmath319 in eq.([eqcorr1 ] ) . from eq.([gamn ] ) the second term of @xmath320 is @xmath321 , which is directly proportional to @xmath322 from the product @xmath323 .",
    "accordingly we have proved basically our point since our result , being proportional to @xmath324 , is indeed negligible compared to the result eq.([ncmfin ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath2 .    actually , to complete our proof",

    "this detailed analysis is performed in appendix [ normselfa ] .",
    "we will now proceed in a similar way to obtain the mode contribution @xmath325 to the anomalous self - energy @xmath326 .",
    "this contribution is obtained by replacing , in the diagrams which lead to the second term of eq.([eqdelta ] ) , any second order product @xmath244 , @xmath327 or @xmath328 , by the corresponding collective mode propagator .",

    "the diagonal component @xmath282 of the collective mode propagator is depicted by the heavy line with a single arrow and the off - diagonal one @xmath329 by the heavy line with two arrows . for the two diagrams",

    "however , as in section [ anomself ] , it is more convenient to add these reducible terms to both members of the equation for @xmath16 . in the left - hand side",
    "one obtains @xmath332^{-1}f(p)[g_0(-p)]^{-1}$ ] , while in the right - hand side one recovers @xmath127 instead of @xmath141 .",
    "finally we restrict ourselves to the contribution of the low frequency collective mode , the higher frequency contributions being expected to be of order @xmath333 and thus negligible , just as in the preceding section [ modnormal ] . accordingly",
    "the variable @xmath71 in @xmath282 and @xmath329 is small .",
    "this implies that @xmath334 , which comes as a factor of @xmath282 , can be replaced by @xmath335 at the order we are working .",

    "this gives merely : @xmath345 now if we proceed as in eq.([eqintx ] ) we come to an integral with an ultraviolet divergence , which would invalidate our procedure .",
    "the reason for this problem is that we have not yet consistently removed in our calculation the terms of order zero and one in @xmath214 , as we have done precedingly . that we should do it was already appearent in eq.([eqfapp ] ) by the notation @xmath346 instead of @xmath347 ( which implies also a multiplication by @xmath348 ) .",
    "we recall that these terms have to be subtracted out because they have already been taken into account in our preceding lowest order calculation .",
    "however in the above preceding cases , it turned out that these terms were equal to zero , which made the subtraction transparent . here",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the most efficient way to perform this subtraction is to note that , from eq.([gamabar ] ) , @xmath329 contains already an explicit factor @xmath254 in the numerator , proportional to @xmath214 , which gives directly the factor @xmath349 in eq.([barza ] ) .",
    "hence the term of order @xmath214 to be subtracted is merely obtained by taking the other factors to order zero in @xmath214 , that is by replacing @xmath275 in eq.([barza ] ) by its zeroth order expression @xmath350 .",
    "actually this argument is a bit too fast .",
    "it misses the fact that we may at the same time evaluate @xmath351 in eq.([eqfapp ] ) with the chemical potential taken as @xmath352 , even for the @xmath353 term , as we had done in eq.([eqt4 ] ) .",

    "in this paper we have presented a general theoretical framework to deal with fermionic superfluidity on the bec side of the bec - bcs crossover .",

    "any interaction between the @xmath114 and @xmath115 propagators is forbidden since this would merely amount to double count processes which are already taken into account in @xmath64 and @xmath61 . in this way we end up with the conclusion that only the born term leads to a non zero contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "in calculating the coefficient of @xmath322 in eq.([eqcorr1 ] ) , it is clear that we can evaluate all the other factors to zeroth order in @xmath16 , since we have already an explicit factor @xmath322 .",

    "this leaves us with : @xmath412    @xmath413 .",
    "naturally this result could have been obtained more directly , by a straight expansion of @xmath282 in powers of @xmath16 , instead of resumming a whole perturbation series , as we have done in section [ collmod ] , and then expanding the result .",

    "this is just the contribution eq.([ncmfin ] ) , where we have obtained the precise coefficient by our careful handling of this low frequency domain .",

    "to be complete we have also to verify that there are no other sources of divergence in eq.([eqgam ] ) , analogous to what we have found at low momentum .",
    "since there is no singularity arising at finite frequency or momentum , the only possibility comes from the large frequency @xmath429 , large momentum @xmath430 region . in order to evaluate the contribution in this domain ,",
    "it is more convenient to go back to the imaginary axis contour by performing backward the first step of eq.([eqcorr1 ] ) and write this overall contribution as : @xmath431 the scattering amplitudes @xmath432 and @xmath433 , introduced by @xmath254 and @xmath434 , may be shown to be equal and are dominated as expected in this range by the born contribution .",

    "the corresponding diagram in @xmath31 is shown in fig.[figdiagsub ] .",
    "this leads to : @xmath441 where @xmath254 is given by eq.([gammirra ] ) .",
    "let us first replace the dimer propagator @xmath108 , given by eq.([2vertex ] ) , by its value @xmath442 where @xmath443 is replaced by its zeroth order value @xmath352 .",
    "when we consider the contribution from the low frequency and momentum contribution , we may replace @xmath254 by @xmath444 , and the pole of @xmath445 at @xmath446 gives : @xmath447= \\frac{4\\pi \\mu _ b\\sqrt{e_b}}{m^{3/2 } }   \\frac{4m}{{\\bf p}^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is indeed the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([eqgamaslash ] ) since in this last equation , which turns out to be of order @xmath448 , we have to make consistently @xmath449 ( and similarly we have to take @xmath450 , with @xmath451 ) .",
    "we are now left with the evaluation of the difference between our original expression and the one we have just considered , namely : @xmath452\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives at the level of eq.([eqgap3 ] ) , after insertion at the level of eq.([eqfapp ] ) and summation over @xmath18 and @xmath71 : @xmath453 t_4(p,0;0 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq.([gammirra ] ) for @xmath254 and the relation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) between @xmath192 and @xmath127 , namely @xmath454 .",
    "we show now that this difference is just what is required to be allowed to replace @xmath455 in eq.([eqt4 ] ) by @xmath456 , which is directly related to the dimer - dimer scattering scattering length @xmath1 by eq.([eqam ] ) .",
    "indeed it has been shown in @xcite that scattering amplitude @xmath457 satisfies quite generally an integral equation analogous to the standard integral equation for elementary bosons , namely : @xmath458 where @xmath459 is the sum of all irreducible diagrams with respect to cutting two dimer propagators , which is itself obtained from an integral equation with explicit kernel @xcite .",
    "formally this equation can be rewritten in terms of operators as : @xmath460 where we have introduced the diagonal operator @xmath461 ( the factor @xmath330 is again topological ) .",
    "we consider now this equation for @xmath462 and @xmath259 .",
    "with respect to the energy variable corresponding to @xmath71 , we take the two values @xmath195 and @xmath463 ( we note the operators with this last value with a superscript @xmath464 ) .",
    "the crucial point is that the difference between @xmath465 and @xmath466 is of order @xmath467 , that is the expansion of @xmath465 in powers of @xmath467 is regular .",
    "such a difference is negligible at the order we are working at .",
    "the regularity of the expansion can be seen from the integral equation ( eq.(b2 ) of ref.@xcite ) satisfied by @xmath465 , which is completely analogous to the one satisfied by @xmath127 ( eq.(9 ) of ref.@xcite ) , except that the last term ( with two dimer propagators ) in the equation for @xmath127 is not present for @xmath465 .",
    "this integral equation can be transformed in the same way , leading to more explicit expressions ( see eq.(11 ) and eq.(13 ) of ref.@xcite ) . on these expressions",
    "one checks easily that , for @xmath19 in the vicinity of @xmath352 , the propagator @xmath202 is evaluated for values of its argument which are never in the vicinity of its pole .",
    "hence one can proceed to a regular expansion .",
    "by contrast one sees also on the equations for @xmath127 that , for the term containing two dimer propagators the argument does reach the pole value , which makes the expansion singular .",
    "this explains why we can not argue that the difference between @xmath468 and @xmath469 is of order @xmath467 and negligible .",
    "the equation for @xmath470 reads : @xmath471^{-1}=\\left[t_4 ^ 0\\right]^{-1}+d^0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] writing the difference with eq.([eqform ] ) and taking into account @xmath472 , we have : @xmath473^{-1}-t_4^{-1}=d - d_0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be rewritten explicitely , after premultiplication by @xmath474 and postmultiplication by @xmath475 , as : @xmath476t_4(q,0;\\{{\\bf 0},-e_b\\})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last term we have been allowed to replace @xmath195 by @xmath270 at the order we are working .",
    "the same substitution is allowed in eq.([eqabc ] ) , which completes our proof .",
    "let us finally note that , with respect to this part , our procedure has obvious strong analogies with the work of beliaev @xcite .",
    "indeed , as soon as we have established the non trivial result that , at our level of approximation , the structure of @xmath465 can be omitted which makes it analogous to an effective interaction , our dimers behave as elementary bosons and we are basically back to the situation investigated by beliaev .    for a very recent review , see s. giorgini , l. p. pitaevskii and s. stringari , arxiv:0706.3360 and to be published in rev .",
