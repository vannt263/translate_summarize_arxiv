    "after the completion of the palomar - quest northern sky survey in september 2008 the quest large field camera ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baltay et al . 2007 ) ) was moved and installed on the 1.0-m eso schmidt in la silla and had first light on april 24 , 2009 .",
    "since september 2009 , the southern survey has been in routine observations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* andrews et al . 2008 ) ) and the telescope and camera are controlled from yale and fully robotic .",
    "we have 90@xmath1 of the time on the telescope with 10@xmath1 allocated to chile .",
    "the quest camera consists of 112 ccds of 600 @xmath2 2400 sarnoff thinned pixels , back illuminated devices with 13 @xmath3 m x 13 @xmath3 m pixel pitch .",
    "the camera covers an area of 4.6@xmath4 @xmath2 3.6@xmath4 on the sky and a plate scale of 0.86 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the survey covers @xmath51000 square degrees per night , primarily between @xmath625@xmath4 to allow for follow up from both hemispheres . the lsq variability ( sn and transient ) survey uses 60 sec exposures ( and the tno survey-180 sec ) taken twice a night with a cadence of 2 nights in one broad band filter of 4000 to 7000 ( qst*-band ) .",
    "the seeing at la silla for the 60 sec exposures is 1.7 arcsec fwhm , reaching depth of 20.5 mag .",
    "the lsq survey subtraction pipeline has started producing between 400 and 900 transient candidates each night ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the lsq rr lyrae star ( rrls ) survey is searching the galactic halo for rrls that have v magnitudes between roughly 14 and 20 . because rrls are excellent standard candles",
    ", they provide a powerful probe of the density distribution of the halo , which is being examined for halo substructure . plotted",
    "are the v magnitude light - curves for three type ab rrls ( fig.[fig5](a ) ) , which illustrate the typical photometric precisions at these magnitudes . from their mean v magnitudes",
    ", we estimate that rrab 12574 , 10770 , and 5381 lie 7 , 13 , and 52 kpc from the sun , respectively .        a deep eclipsing cataclysmic variable ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rabinowitz et al .",
    "2011a ) ) was discovered with eclipse depths @xmath75.7 magnitudes , orbital period 94.657 min , and peak brightness v@xmath518 at j2000 position 17h 25 m 54.8s , -64 deg 38 min 39 sec .",
    "light curves in b , v , r , i , z and j were obtained with smarts 1.3-m and 1.0-m telescopes at cerro tololo and spectra from 3500 to 9000 with the soar 4.3-m telescope at cerro pachon .",
    "the optical light curves ( fig.[fig5](b ) ) show a deep , 5-min eclipse immediately followed by a shallow 38-min eclipse and then sinusoidal variation .",
    "no eclipses appear in j. during the deep eclipse the measure of v - j @xmath7 7.1 corresponds to a spectral type m8 or later secondary .",
    "the spectra show strong hydrogen emission lines , doppler broadened by 600 - 1300 km s-1 , oscillating with radial velocity that peaks at mid deep eclipse with semiamplitude 500 @xmath6 22 km s-1 .",
    "it is suggested that lsq172554.8 - 643839 is a polar with a low - mass secondary viewed at high inclination .",
    "an apparent dwarf nova was discovered ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rabinowitz et al . 2011b ) ) on june 11.046 ( when the variable was at magnitude r = 16.3 ) and june 11.063 ut ( at r = 16.0)(fig.[fig6](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "a faint source is reported at this position in the guide star catalog v2.3.2 ( with bj = 20.76 ) .",
    "simultaneous visible and j - band observations were taken with andicam on the 1.3-m smarts telescope at cerro tololo .",
    "a spectrum ( range 0.350 - 0.966 nm ) taken on june 26 with gmos on the gemini south telescope reveals strong h - alpha and h - beta emission lines , with h - alpha clearly double - peaked , indicating the presence of an accretion disk with rotational velocity 1000 km / s ."
