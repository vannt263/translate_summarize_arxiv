    "experimentally , quantum dots were intensively studied in recent years , using a variety of different techniques , including capacitance @xcite , transport @xcite , far - infrared @xcite and raman spectroscopy @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , quantum dots are ideal physical objects for studying effects of electron - electron correlations .",
    "different theoretical approaches , including analytical calculations @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , density functional theory @xcite and other methods @xcite , were applied to study their properties , for a recent review see ref . @xcite .",

    "the aim of these studies is to investigate the fermi liquid ",
    "wigner solid crossover in the dots , at a varying strength of coulomb interaction . detailed knowledge of the physics of such a crossover in microscopic dots could be compared with that obtained for macroscopic 2des @xcite and might shed light on the nature of the metal - insulator transition in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "so far , full energy spectra of an @xmath6-electron parabolic quantum dot in zero magnetic field , as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath7 , were published only for @xmath8 ( quantum - dot helium @xcite ) . for larger",
    "@xmath6 a number of results for the ground state energy of the dots were reported at separate points of the @xmath7 axis .",
    "sometimes , however , results obtained by different methods contradict to each other , and full understanding of physical properties of @xmath6-electron dots at @xmath5 has not yet been achieved .",
    "even for three electrons in a parabolic confining potential ( quantum - dot lithium ) available in the literature results are somewhat confusing and do not give a clear and exact picture of the ground state of the dot .",
    "egger et al . reported in @xcite on a transition from a partly to a fully spin - polarized ground state at @xmath9 caused by the intra - dot coulomb interaction ( @xmath10-component of the total spin @xmath11 changes from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) .",
    "this conclusion was based on results of qmc calculations ( multilevel blocking algorithm ) .",

    "they gave _ the same _ energies of the 1/2 and 3/2 states .",
    "the conclusion from these two publications in the part concerning the three - electron quantum dot is thus not clear .",
    "husler @xcite , calculating the energy spectrum of a three - electron dot using the so - called pocket state method , gave a more definite indication on the existence of such a transition .",
    "he presented his results , however , in some specific for the method and not - directly related to @xmath7 units , which does not allow one to quantitatively characterize the transition ( e.g. to get the value of the interaction parameter @xmath7 at the transition point ) .",
    "husler also pointed out that some indications on such a transition can be also seen in earlier studies of a three - electron dot : in ref .",

    "i study the densities and the pair - correlation functions in the ground and the first excited states of the system at a number of @xmath7-points , including the vicinity of the transition .",

    "additional and even more interesting information can be extracted from figures [ dens11u ] and [ dens11d ] , which show separately the densities of spin - up and spin - down polarized electrons .",

    "such a situation is a peculiar quantum - mechanical feature : it is not encountered in the classical picture . with the growing @xmath7 ( electron - electron interaction increases )",
    "the two spin - up electrons push the spin - down electron out from the center , but the structure `` one ( spin - down ) electron is essentially closer to the center , two ( spin - up ) electrons rotate around '' conserves up to @xmath171 : the density of the spin - up electrons has a clear maximum at a finite distance from the origin , while the density of spin - down electron still maximal at @xmath170 . at even larger @xmath7 ( @xmath172 ) ( stronger electron - electron interaction ) the density maximum of the spin - down electron",

    "let @xmath178 ( the second row of plots ) .",
    "one sees that the maximum of the pair - correlation function is about two times closer to the center of the dot for the spin - down electron ( figure [ pcf11b ] ) than for the spin - up electron ( figure [ pcf111a ] ) . at @xmath14",
    "this difference is less pronounced but can also be seen . in figure [ pcf11b ]",
    "one also sees that in the limit of weak coulomb interaction @xmath161 the spin - down electron is localized in the center , in agreement with the above analysis of the density plots .",
    "the internal structure of the state @xmath67 thus corresponds to an angle - averaged configuration of an _",
