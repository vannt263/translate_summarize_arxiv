    "entangled qubits play a key role in many applications of quantum information @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "an example of a qubit is the polarization state of a photon . more generally , a qudit is a quantum system whose state lies in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the higher dimensionality implies a greater potential for applications in quantum information processing and this explains the continuously growing interest in methods for creating entangled qudits .    among these methods , spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) appears to be the most reliable one for creating entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "recently , several techniques have been used to create entangled qudits from down - converted photons .",
    "for example , conservation of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) in spdc , has been used to create entangled states with @xmath1 @xcite , and a time binning method was employed to realize states with @xmath2 @xcite . recently",
    ", spatial degrees of freedom in spdc @xcite have been exploited to demonstrate entanglement for the cases @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that _ useful _ high - dimensional entanglement can be witnessed by violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite which also furnish a test of nonlocality for a quantum system .",
    "however , tests of @xmath0-dimensional inequalities for bipartite quantum systems , require the use of at least @xmath5 detectors which becomes exceedingly difficult ( if not impossible ) for large @xmath0 .    in a previous paper @xcite we proposed an experiment to show the entanglement of high - dimensional two - photon oam states , with _ two _ detectors only .",
    "this scheme indeed allows to verify the existence of high - dimensional non - separability , as demonstrated by our subsequent experimental results @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we went on to use a @xmath6-dimensional bell inequality to check the non - locality of our oam - entangled photons . in the meantime we have realized that this implicitly assumes dichotomic variables , a condition that was not fulfilled by the scheme proposed in @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we propose an experimental scheme to explicitly test the non - locality ( namely , the _ useful _ entanglement ) of very - high - dimensional two - photon oam states ( @xmath7 ) , by using just @xmath8 detectors .",
    "the advantages of our method with respect to those using @xmath5 detectors are obvious for @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , we stress that the scheme we propose is designed to realize dichotomic observables .",
    "the idea is first to project the infinite - dimensional two - photon state onto several different four - dimensional subspaces ( in order to select different four - dimensional two - photon states ) , and then to apply the clauser - horne ( ch ) inequality @xcite to each selected state .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ whether such a scheme will work or not .",
    "in fact several legitimate questions can be raised : ( i ) does this dimensional reduction spoil the entanglement of the two - photon state ?",
    "( ii ) do selected four - dimensional states maximally violate the chsh inequality ? ( iii ) are distinct four - dimensional subspaces equivalent ? in the rest of this paper we will address these questions .",
    "let us describe the scheme of our proposed experiment ( fig .",
    "1 ) . a thin nonlinear crystal yields oam - entangled photon pairs , and the two photons ( say @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are fed into two balanced mach - zehnder interferometers .",
    "each mach - zehnder @xmath12 is made of a @xmath13 input beam splitter and a variable - reflectivity output beam splitter , indicated in fig .",

    "such a vbs can be easily realized , for example , by exploiting the polarization degrees of freedom of the spdc photons .",
    "type i crystals emit photon pairs with a well defined linear polarization .",
    "then , the combination of an half - wave plate before the mach - zehnder and a polarizing beam splitter as output bs of the same interferometer , realizes the desired vbs . another possibility is to use use a fabry - prot talon whose mirror separation can be varied , to realize a so - called `` lorentzian beam splitter '' @xcite , which works as a vbs . in each channel @xmath20 of the interferometer @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , there is a spiral phase plate spp ( complementary spiral phase plate : cspp ) , oriented at @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . in the following",

    "the output channel `` @xmath26 '' of the interferometer @xmath27 is coupled to a single - mode fiber @xmath28 which sustains the laguerre - gaussian mode @xmath29 with waist @xmath30 .",
    "the output ports of the two fibers @xmath31 and @xmath32 are coupled with two detectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , which measure the twin - photon coincidence rate .",

    "now , providing that the state vectors @xmath273 ) are chosen to be linearly independent , we can extend the ch test to the @xmath226 pairs @xmath274 defining @xmath226 pairs of two - dimensional subspaces whose union define a @xmath275 two - photon subspace . in this way we can demonstrate the non - local nature of the high - dimensional two - photon oam - entangled states .    in summary",
    ", in this paper we proposed a novel experimental setup to investigate the non - locality of high - dimensional two - photon oam - entangled states generated by spdc .",
    "we use a pair of modified mach - zehnder interferometers ( one per photon ) , as oam analyzers . inside each mz",
    "there are two spps ( one per arm ) which can rotate around their axes and permit us to explore the infinite - dimensional two - photon hilbert space .",
    "the output port of each mz is made of a reflectivity - varying beam splitter which acts as a polarizer in the two - dimensional space defined by the two spatial modes ( the two arms ) of each mz .",
    "when the output ports of these oam analyzers are fed into single - mode optical fibers , the effective dimensionality of the two - photon hilbert space reduces from @xmath177 to @xmath8 .",
    "because of this entanglement - preserving dimensional reduction , our experimental scheme permits us to check the non - locality of the two - photon oam - entangled state , by using a @xmath276 inequality @xcite . in this way we found the maximum violation of the ch inequality for any four - dimensional two - photon subspace selected by the spps orientations .",
    "moreover , because of the strict analogy between ours four - dimensional two - photon subspaces and four - dimensional two - photon _ polarization _ space , other interesting experiments ( e.g. teleportation of spatial degrees of freedom ) can be implemented by using our scheme .        for completeness",
