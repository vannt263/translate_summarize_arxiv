    "it is a prototype of materials which exhibit several polytypes ( more than 200 ) and the only iv - iv compound which possesses long range order polytypes .",
    "the cubic modification 3c - sic has a zinc - blende structure , being thus the type with closest structural relationship to both diamond and elemental si .",
    "from the point of view of basic research , there exists a large body of experimental data on silicon carbide , so that the quality of theoretical approaches and computer simulations can be contrasted against them.@xcite    the influence of anharmonic effects in the vibrational properties of 3c - sic is revealed by several experimental studies .",
    "the pressure dependence of optical phonons in 3c - sic has been measured by means of first- and second - order raman scattering up to 23 gpa , @xcite while their temperature dependence has been studied by first - order raman scattering up to 750 k. @xcite the pressure dependence of phonon lifetimes , which provides detailed information on the anharmonic phonon - phonon interaction , has been also calculated from first principles using perturbation theory.@xcite these calculations permitted a detailed analysis of the microscopic anharmonic mechanism and yielded accurate predictions of experimental properties .    the thermal expansion of the lattice is another property determined by the anharmonicity of the interatomic potential .",
    "there is no evidence of negative thermal expansion in 3c - sic , in contrast to diamond and elemental si , which show negative thermal expansion at temperatures below 100 k. @xcite an analysis of the most reliable experimental data for the thermal expansion of 3c - sic led to a tabulation of recommended values for this quantity in ref . .",
    "theoretical results for the temperature dependence of the linear thermal expansion for 3c - sic have been also reported using the quasiharmonic approximation.@xcite    the optical properties of 3c - sic have been measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry as a function of temperature in the range between 90 and 550 k.@xcite the electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the decrease found in the interband transition energies as temperature increases .",
    "we recall that the renormalization of the optical response of semiconductors by electron - phonon interaction has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years,@xcite with special focus in the characterization of isotopic effects.@xcite from a theoretical point of view , the electron - phonon interaction in tetrahedral semiconductors has been studied so far by perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite    an interesting alternative to perturbational approaches to study the coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in solids , is the combination of the path integral ( pi ) formulation with electronic structure methods .",
    "the path integral approach to statistical mechanics allows us to study finite temperature properties that are related to the quantum nature of the atomic nuclei .",
    "@xcite an advantage of its combination with electronic structure methods is that both the electrons and the atomic nuclei are then treated quantum mechanically in the framework of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation , so that phonon - phonon and electron - phonon interactions are automatically considered in the simulation .",
    "this unified scheme has been applied so far to the study of solids and molecules containing light atoms .",
    "@xcite a recent application of this method has shown that the electron - phonon coupling leads to a zero - point renormalization of the direct electronic gap of diamond of 10%,@xcite in agreement with a previous perturbational analysis.@xcite    in this paper we present a path integral molecular dynamics study of 3c - sic at temperatures between 100 and 1200 k and pressures up to 60 gpa .",
    "the electronic structure was treated with a non - orthogonal tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian as a reasonable compromise to reduce the computational cost of deriving the bo energy surface for the nuclear dynamics .",
    "we are interested in the simulation of vibrational properties that rely on phonon - phonon interactions , such as the temperature dependence of the linear expansion coefficient , and also in the simulation of electronic properties that are determined by electron - phonon coupling , such as the temperature dependence of the direct electronic gap .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we describe the computational method employed in our simulations .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in sec.iii , dealing with the thermal expansion coefficient and the temperature dependence of the direct electronic gap of 3c - sic .",
    "the results for the electronic gap in 3c - sic will be then related to those derived for diamond and crystalline si .",
    "the results of the simulation will also be compared to available experimental data .",
    "the pressure dependence of the electronic gap as well as the results for the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative at 300 k will complete sec.iii . in sec.iv , we present the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "the formalism employed here for the quantum treatment of electrons and nuclei is based on the combination of the path integral formulation , to derive properties of the atomic nuclei in thermal equilibrium , with an electronic tight - binding hamiltonian to describe the bo energy surface , @xmath0 , of 3c - sic as a function of the nuclear configuration @xmath1 .",
    "this approach has been recently used in our simulation of diamond@xcite and isolated hydrogenic impurities in diamond@xcite in the canonical @xmath2 ensemble ( number of atoms @xmath3 , volume @xmath4 , and temperature @xmath5 are constant ) .",
    "therefore , we present here only a brief summary of the method , with focus on those extensions required for the 3c - sic simulations , that were performed in both the @xmath2 and the isothermal - isobaric @xmath6 ensemble ( @xmath3 , pressure @xmath7 , and @xmath5 are constant ) .",
    "the combination of the path integral formalism with ab initio hamiltonians based on density funtional theory ( dft ) is an interesting alternative that has been reviewed in the literature , @xcite but it has not been applied so far to the investigation of the temperature dependence of the optical response in semiconductors .",
    "typically tight binding methods are two orders of magnitude faster than ab initio dft methods .    the employed tight - binding one - electron effective hamiltonian is based on density functional ( df ) calculations.@xcite the tb energy consists of two terms , the first one of which is the sum of occupied one - electron state energies , and the second is given by a pair - wise repulsive interatomic potential .",
    "the one - electron states are derived by diagonalizing a two - center hamiltonian using a minimal basis of non - orthogonal atomic orbitals .",
    "the pair potential is adjusted so that the df energy is reproduced for a series of reference systems ( e.g. the dimer , the crystal , etc . )",
    "the total energy is thus obtained by adding to the electronic energy the repulsive pair - potential .",
    "preliminary calculations on 3c - sic revealed that the original parameterization of the pair - potential between si and c leads to an overestimation of anharmonic effects in 3c - sic , a fact that motivated us to improve the parameterization of the si - c pair - potential as explained in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "the computational advantage of using the path - integral formulation of statistical mechanics is based on the so - called `` quantum - classical '' isomorphism .",
    "thus , this method exploits the fact that the partition function of a quantum system is formally equivalent to that of a classical one , obtained by replacing each quantum particle ( here , atomic nucleus ) by a ring polymer consisting of @xmath8 `` beads '' , connected by harmonic springs.@xcite in many - body problems , the configuration space of the classical isomorph is usually sampled by monte carlo or molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques . here",
    ", we have employed the pi md method , which has been found to require less computer time resources when applied to our problem .",
    "effective algorithms to perform pi md simulations in the canonical @xmath2 ensemble have been described in detail by martyna _",
    "et al._@xcite and by tuckerman.@xcite the extensions for pi md simulations in the @xmath6 ensemble require the definition of appropriate dynamical equations of motion to include the volume as fluctuating dynamical variable , and multiple time step algorithms to integrate these equations numerically .",
    "these extensions are well documented in refs . .",
    "for the simulation of 3c - sic in the @xmath6 ensemble only isotropic volume fluctuations were allowed .",
    "all calculations presented here were carried out using originally developed software , which enables efficient pi md simulations on parallel supercomputers .",
    "simulations were performed on a @xmath9 supercell of the 3c - sic face - centered cubic cell with periodic boundary conditions , containing @xmath10 64 atoms .",
    "convergence criteria used previously for diamond were proved to apply also for the 3c - sic simulations .",
    "thus , we used only the @xmath11 point for the sampling of the brillouin zone  ( bz ) of the simulation supercell in the electronic structure calculation .",
    "a set of 4 @xmath12 points would increase the computer time by a factor of 10 without significant changes of the results presented here . for a given temperature , a typical run consisted of @xmath13 md steps for system equilibration , followed by @xmath14 steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties . to have a nearly constant precision in the path integral results at different temperatures , we have taken a number of beads , @xmath8 ( trotter number ) , that scales with @xmath15 k. the atomic masses of c and si",
    "were set to 12.011 and 28.086 amu , respectively . within the employed formalism ,",
    "the classical limit of a given nucleus is reached by setting the corresponding nuclear mass tending to infinity .",
    "thus , for comparison with the results of our full pi md simulations , we have carried out some pi md simulations were the mass of either c or si was set to a very large number ( @xmath16 amu ) .",
    "the main effect of setting such a large nuclear mass in the path integral simulation is that the ring polymer associated to the atomic nucleus shrinks and looks just like a point ( classical ) particle .",
    "moreover , the calculation of thermostatted equations of motion by using chains of nos - hoover thermostats ( see below ) ensures that the canonical probability distribution of the shrinked classical - like particles is correctly sampled as a function of temperature .",
    "also classical md simulations were performed with the same interatomic interaction .",
    "the classical limit is easily achieved within the pi algorithm by setting the trotter number @xmath8 = 1 .",
    "the quantum simulations were performed using a staging transformation for the bead coordinates .",
    "chains of four nos - hoover thermostats were coupled to each of the staging variables to generate the canonical @xmath2 ensemble .",
    "@xcite to integrate the equations of motion we have used the reversible reference system propagator algorithm ( respa ) , which allows one to define different time steps for the integration of the fast and slow degrees of freedom.@xcite for the evolution of the fast dynamical variables , that include the thermostats and harmonic bead interactions , we used a time step @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the time step associated to the calculation of tb forces . a value of @xmath18 = 0.5  fs was found to provide adequate convergence . the thermostat `` mass '' parameter , @xmath19 , is chosen to evolve in the scale of the harmonic bead forces by being defined as@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 = @xmath22 represents the inverse temperature . in the case of the @xmath6 ensemble a chain of four barostats was coupled to the volume and the barostat `` mass '' parameter was set 100 times larger than the thermostat one . by calculating the average pressure in the @xmath2 ensemble we could check the internal consistency between our @xmath6 and @xmath2 simulations .",

    "the direct electronic gap of 3c - sic was derived as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ensemble average of the one - electron states associated with the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band at the @xmath11 ( @xmath26 ) reciprocal lattice point . for details on the calculation of the expectation values @xmath24 and @xmath25 see ref . .",
    "several sets of simulations were performed in this work .",
    "two sets of 3c - sic simulations were done at temperatures between 100 and 1200 k. one set corresponds to @xmath6 simulations at constant pressure ( @xmath7=0 ) , and the other to @xmath2 simulations at constant volume ( @xmath27  ) .",

    "the simulation method employed in this work has demonstrated its capability for the description of anharmonic effects related to the phonon - phonon interaction , as well as for the treatment of the electron - phonon coupling in semiconducting solids as a function of temperature .",

    "the zero - point renormalization of the cell parameter of 3c - sic is calculated to be @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we find that this value is close to the sum of zero - point renormalizations obtained when only one type of atomic nuclei ( either si or c ) is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "this near linear behavior is probably related to the fact that the cell parameter renormalization depends only on second - order terms in the nuclei displacements , due to the small magnitude of @xmath58 .",
    "the direct electronic gap at @xmath11 of 3c - sic has a significant temperature dependence as a consequence of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the effect of the zero - point vibrations of the lattice phonons leads to a gap renormalization of @xmath59 ev ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this effect is so large that any theoretical approach aiming at a quantitative determination of the direct electronic gap can not be based only on an improved solution of the many - body electron problem , but it should also include the treatment of the electron - phonon interaction .",

    "the calculated pressure coefficient of @xmath36 is 39 mev / gpa at 300 k. an ab initio calculation without considering temperature and electron - phonon interactions gives a value of 51 mev / gpa .",
