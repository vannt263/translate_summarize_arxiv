    "melanin is a biological pigment found in the skin , hair and eyes of many species , including humans .",
    "it is thought to be a photoprotectant , but paradoxically has also been implicated in the chain of events that lead to melanoma skin cancer @xcite .",
    "of the two types found in human skin ( eumelanin and pheomelanin ) eumelanin is the most common , and the most extensively studied .",
    "eumelanin is known to be a macromolecule of dhi ( dihydroxyindole ) and dhica ( dihydroxyindole - carboxylic acid ) , but the nature of the secondary structure ( i.e. the supramolecular organisation ) is not known .",
    "likely related to its photoprotective role , eumelanin has a broadband absorption spectrum that increases exponentially towards the ultraviolet .",
    "this is a highly unusual feature ; most biological pigments exhibit distinct absorption bands .",
    "the origin of the broadband absorption spectrum of eumelanin has long been the topic of scientific debate , which continues to this day .",
    "galvao and caldas have used huckel theory to attempt to reproduce the broadband shape , with some success @xcite .",
    "more recently , density functional theory has been used to predict the optical properties of small eumelanin oliogmers @xcite .",
    "this has lead to the theory that eumelanin may in fact be a collection of different small oligomers of varying electronic structure .",
    "the broadband absorption of eumelanin may then be due to the summation of these individual spectra @xcite .",
    "this idea was recently extended by the suggestion that the broadband absorption may be due to extreme chemical disorder @xcite .",
    "wolbarsht first suggested that the broadband absorption spectrum may be due to scattering , rather than electronic or physical properties of the eumelanin itself @xcite .",
    "he noted that rayleigh scattering would reproduce the broadband spectrum , and account for the increase in optical density at short wavelengths .",
    "this has very serious implications ; if the measured shape of the absorption spectrum is dominated by scattering then great care must be taken when calculating optical properties . despite several studies on the topic , optical scattering remains a significant concern .",
    "the published literature on the scattering of eumelanin solutions is sparse and not cohesive , hence it is useful at this point to briefly review past work .",
    "the importance of optical scattering was noted by nofsinger and simon when they discovered that the shape of the eumelanin absorption spectrum is strongly dependant upon the particle size @xcite . since",
    "scattering intensity is very strongly dependant upon particle size this could indicate that the optical density of eumelanin is dominated by scattering . to test this ,",
    "they conducted photoacoustic measurments which suggested that the measured optical density was not dominated by scattering for wavelengths longer than 400 nm for any particle size fraction @xcite . an earlier photoacoustic calorimetry measurement by forest and simon similarly suggested that scattering contributes no more than @xmath4 of the total light extinction at 350 nm @xcite . hence nofsinger and simon concluded that the observed dependance upon particle size was due to electronic and physical properties of the eumelanin .",
    "recently , a number of optical emission and excitation studies have been published , which report accurate quantitative measurement of key properties such as the radiative quantum yield as a function of wavelength @xcite .",
    "such studies provide valuable insight into energy absorption and dissipation mechanisms , as well as shedding light on the structural question .",
    "these measurements require the assumption that scattering is negligible .",
    "if this is not the case , the scattering coefficient should be measured and subtracted from the optical density to obtain the true absorption .",
    "this was attempted by krysciak , who directly measured the optical scattering from a dilute eumelanin solution as a function of wavelength @xcite .",
    "he found scattering to be negligible between 500 and 700 nm , but also discovered the puzzling result of ` negative scattering ' at shorter wavelengths .",
    "he suggested that this was due to multiple scattering events and absorption ( which becomes very large at shorter wavelengths ) decreasing the measured scattering below the previously measured baseline .",
    "krysciak s results were non - conclusive , neither confirming nor excluding the prescence of scattering at optical wavelengths .",
    "the following year , kurtz reported on a theoretical prediction of the relative contributions of scattering and absorption to the optical density of eumelanin @xcite .",
    "he found that in the rayleigh regime ( particle radii much less than the wavelength ) absorption dominated over scattering , whereas for larger particles the two contributed equally .",
    "he emphasised the very strong dependance of scattering on particle size .",
    "the importance of this is experimentally apparent in a 2001 study by sardar et al .",
    "where scattering and absorption coefficients were measured at four optical wavelengths between 633 nm and 476 nm @xcite .",
    "they found that scattering far outweighed absorption at all wavelengths , contributing more than @xmath5 of the optical density at 633 nm .",
    "this result contradicts all previous studies , and is almost certainly due to the sample preparation , which resulted in what was described as ` a brown turbid suspension ' .",
    "the authors state that the eumelanin particles were not solubilised and remained a particulate suspension . under these conditions",
    ", the particle sizes would most likely be much larger than those in the well solubilised , dilute solutions typically used for spectroscopic studies @xcite .",
    "other studies have attempted to use alternative methods to measure the absorption of eumelanin in the absence of scattering effects .",
    "caiti et al . used photoacoustic phase angle spectroscopy of powdered melanins in the dry state @xcite .",
    "this technique is insensitive to scattering , and confirmed unambiguously the decrease in the absorption of melanins with increasing wavelength .",
    "unfortunately , the phase spectra do not correspond by visual inspection to absorption spectra , and interpretation remains difficult .",
    "therefore , while this study sheds doubt on the wolbarsht model , it does not allow correction of absorption spectra for scattering effects in a quantitative way .",
    "similarly , a recent study by albuquerque et al . used photopyroelectric spectroscopy to measure the optical absorption coefficient of eumelanin in the solid state @xcite . again , the decrease in absorption with increasing wavelength was confirmed , although a direct comparison with solution measurements could not be made due to the different properties of the system .",
    "interestingly , a band gap was observed at 1.70ev ( 730 nm ) , which is possibly hidden in solution spectra by scattering .    a careful study by vitkin et al . in 1994",
    "gives the most quantitative estimate available of the scattering coefficient of a eumelanin solution @xcite .",
    "vitkin et al",
    ". conducted photometric measurements with a double integrating sphere system at 580 nm and 633 nm .",
    "they found that scattering contributed @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the total attenuation coefficient at each wavelength respectively .",
    "these values , while small , are enough to introduce significant error in the measurement of the radiative quantum yield and other optical parameters , and should ideally be corrected for .",
    "a measurement of the scattering coefficient as a function of wavelength would allow the subtraction of scattering effects from the optical density spectrum to achieve this .",
    "if the scattering coefficient as a function of wavelength were known , the shape of the scattering spectrum could be compared with rayleigh theory . as stated earlier",
    ", there remains debate as to the secondary structure of eumelanin : heteropolymer or nanoaggregate @xcite .",
    "this is a most fundamental question , since it influences the interpretation of many other experiments .",
    "since rayleigh scattering is strongly dependant upon particle size , these scattering measurements can also be used to determine a fundamental particle size of eumelanin in solution .",
    "hence we have conducted an integrated scattering measurement as a function of wavelength over the ultraviolet range , where scattering effects should be most significant .    in addition , the solutions used by vitkin et al .",
    "( @xmath8 to @xmath9 eumelanin by weight ) were more concentrated than those best suited to photoluminescence measurements .",
    "the broadband absorption spectrum of eumelanin gives rise to significant reabsorption and inner filter effects at concentrations above @xmath10 by weight @xcite .",
    "although scattering should scale linearly with concentration it is feasible that there is less aggregation at lower concentrations , giving rise to less scattering .",
    "hence we have made a direct measurement of the scattering coefficient at the ideal spectroscopic concentration .    in this study",
    "we :    1 .",
    "measure the integrated scattering from an optical spectroscopy grade eumelanin solution as a function of wavelength from 210 nm to 325 nm 2 .",
    "develop general equations to calculate the scattering in broadband absorbing samples , and apply these to the specific case of a eumelanin solution 3 .",
    "show that the measured scattering is consistent with rayleigh theory , and use this to estimate an approximate particle size",
    "synthetic eumelanin ( dopamelanin ) derived from the non - enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine was purchased from sigma aldrich , and used without further purification .",
    "the powder was solubilized to form a @xmath11 solution ( by weight ) in high purity @xmath12 milliq de - ionised water .",
    "this stock solution was then diluted to a concentration ( by weight ) of @xmath10 . to aid solubility ,",
    "the ph of the solution was adjusted to approximately ph11.5 using naoh , and the solution gently heated with sonication . under such conditions a pale brown ,",
    "apparently continuous eumelanin dispersion was produced .",
    "this is identical to the sample preparation typically used for spectroscopic analysis @xcite .",
    "this concentration is usually selected since it maximises the weak photoluminescence signal whilst minimising distorting re - absorption and probe beam attenuation effects .      an absorption spectrum between 200 nm and 800 nm",
    "was recorded for the synthetic eumelanin solution using a perkin elmer lambda 40 spectrophotometer .",
    "an integration of 2 nm , scan speed of 240nm / min and slit width of 3 nm bandpass were used .",
    "the spectrum was collected using a quartz 1 cm square cuvette .",
    "solvent scans ( obtained under identical conditions ) were used for background correction .",
    "scattering measurements were made using a perkin elmer lambda 40 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere attachment ( labsphere rsa - pe-20 reflectance spectroscopy accessory ) .",
    "the solution was contained within a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette that was placed at the front and back of the sphere as shown in figure [ fig : scatteringapparatus ] b ) and c ) to measure the forwards and backwards integrated scattering respectively .",
    "measurements were taken with a scan speed of 120nm / min , a slit width of 4 nm bandpass and 2 nm smoothing . since the scattering intensity was very low each scan",
    "was taken five times and averaged .",
    "the @xmath13 reflectance intensity was determined using a labsphere certified reflectance standard , as shown in figure [ fig : scatteringapparatus ] a ) .",
    "the solvent alone was measured in both the front and back positions ( figure [ fig : scatteringapparatus ] b ) and c ) ) and subtracted after absorption correction ( described in the following section ) .",
    "some light was inevitably lost due to the non - zero size of the beam entry and exit holes in the sphere , and due to the width of the cuvette .",
    "this loss , along with the non - perfect reflectivity of the inside of the sphere was accounted for by the use of the @xmath13 transmission measurement as a standard .",
    "a short path length cuvette ( 1 mm ) was used to minimise this loss .",
    "eumelanin solutions have strong , broadband absorbance , and all optical spectroscopic results are therefore affected by re - absorption ( attenuation of photoluminescence ) and inner filter ( attenuation of the incident beam ) effects . although a narrow cuvette and dilute concentration were used to minimise these effects , it was necessary to perform a careful analysis to account for attenuation of the measured scattering by absorption .",
    "we derive here a general method for correcting for absorption effects in scattering measurements that can be applied to any strongly absorbing solution .",
    "we define @xmath14 to be the forward scattering coefficient , @xmath15 to be the backward scattering coefficient , and @xmath16 to be the total scattering coefficient , such that @xmath17 .",
    "the absorption coefficient is given by @xmath18 and the total attentuation coefficient is given by @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 ( any attenuation not due to scattering is included in the absorption coefficient ) .",
    "consider a cuvette of width @xmath21 , with a beam of light incident from the left , as shown in figure [ fig : cuvette1 ] . by definition , in a small region @xmath22 the attenuation of the beam due to each effect ( scattering or absorption ) is proportional to each @xmath23 , and to the intensity of the beam in that region ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore : @xmath25 which is the familiar beer - lambert law , where @xmath26 is the intensity of light incident upon the cuvette .",
    "therefore the intensity of light scattered forward ( @xmath27 ) is given by : @xmath28dx \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\frac{\\alpha_{sf}}{\\alpha_t}i_0\\left(1-e^{-\\alpha_td}\\right ) \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we make the geometric approximation that the light scattered in the forward direction will travel a path length of @xmath29 to leave the cuvette ( refer to figure [ fig : cuvette1 ] ) . as the scattered light travels this distance through the eumelanin solution it will be attenuated by absorption .",
    "we assume that attenuation is only due to absorption here , and not scattering , since multiple scattering events will still be detected .",
    "let the final intensity emitted forwards from the cuvette ( attenuated by absorption ) be given by @xmath30 . using the beer - lambert law : @xmath31i_0 \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to determine the amount of light that was originally scattered ( @xmath27 ) from the attenuated intensity that we measure ( @xmath30 ) we combine equations [ eq:3 ] and [ eq:4 ] to eliminate @xmath26 : @xmath32 where we must subtract off the background signal ( @xmath33 ) which is measured from a blank cuvette ( containing solvent only ) to remove scattering from the solvent and cuvette walls .",
    "this process can be repeated in a very similar manner for the backwards scattering to find : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the intensity of light scattered backwards , @xmath36 is this intensity attenuated by absorption , and @xmath37 is the background scattering in the backwards direction . note that the different form of the equation is due to the fact that the absorption for back scattering is calculated over a distance @xmath38 rather than @xmath29 , as shown in figure [ fig : cuvette1 ] .",
    "we must now take into account the actual manner in which the intensity of the scattered light was measured .",
    "we define @xmath39 to be the light received by the detector as a percentage of the maximum light received with a standard reflector in place of the beamdump ( refer to figure [ fig : scatteringapparatus ] ) : @xmath40 assuming the detector receives a constant fraction of the true scattered light , and @xmath13 of the light is scattered by the standard reflector in the calibration test : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is scattering in either the forwards or backwards direction .",
    "thus @xmath39 is the percentage of incident light scattered by the sample .",
    "however , the detected values are affected by absorption .",
    "let @xmath43 be the scattering signal actually measured ( affected by absorption ) : @xmath44 since @xmath39 is linear in @xmath45 we can apply the recorrection given in equation [ eq : intensitycorrection ] to obtain @xmath46 , the true percentage of @xmath26 that is scattered forwards : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the background scattering signal measured in the forwards directions . similarly for scattering backwards : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the percentage of incident light scattered backwards , @xmath51 is this percentage attenuated by absorption , and @xmath52 is the percentage scattered backwards in the background measurement .",
    "finally , we must relate these to the total scattering coefficient , @xmath53 . combining equations [ eq:3 ] and [ eq:6 ] and similar equations for backscattering",
    "we find that the total scattering , @xmath54 , is given by : @xmath55 combining this with equations [ eq:7 ] and [ eq:8 ]",
    "we find : @xmath56 since @xmath20 this equation has only one unknown ( @xmath53 ) and can be solved ( @xmath43 , @xmath51 , @xmath48 , @xmath52 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 are all measurable ) .",
    "this must be done numerically , since @xmath53 appears non - trivially on both sides .",
    "figure [ fig : scatvsabs ] shows the absorption coefficient for a @xmath10 ( by weight ) solution of synthetic eumelanin over the visible and uv range .",
    "it is typically broadband , and in excellent agreement with previously published absorption spectra of eumelanins @xcite . the measured scattering coefficient for the same solution is also shown , as a function of wavelength between 210 nm and 325 nm ( calculated using equation [ eq : final ] ) . for wavelengths longer than 325",
    "nm the scattering coefficient was less than the minimum sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "we expect that scattering will decrease at longer wavelengths ; rayleigh scattering , for particles with radii smaller than @xmath57 50 nm has a @xmath58 dependance , and mie scattering , for larger particles , is independant of wavelength .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the scattering coefficient is less than the measured values over the whole visible range .",
    "the percentage of the total attenuation due to scattering ( @xmath59 ) was calculated as a function of wavelength , and is plotted in figure [ fig : percscat ] . it can be shown that the ratio of the coefficients is equivalent to the ratio of the intensities : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the intensity of light lost due to absorption and @xmath62 is the intensity of light lost due to scattering .",
    "hence this quantity gives the percentage of the lost intensity that is due to scattering .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig : percscat ] that scattering contributes less than @xmath0 of the total loss at all wavelengths within the measured range .",
    "this means that measured absorption spectra ( total loss spectra ) of eumelanin can be assumed to be primarily due to actual absorption , and used for interpretation of spectroscopic data without further manipulation .",
    "this allows accurate determination of important quantities such as the radiative quantum yield of eumelanin @xcite .",
    "this percentage is less than that measured by vitkin et al .",
    "( @xmath6 at 580 nm and @xmath7 at 633 nm ) and possibly indicates less aggregation in our more dilute solutions @xcite .",
    "the scattering coefficient appears to exhibit a dependancy upon the wavelength ( figure [ fig : scatwithfit ] ) which is suggestive of rayleigh scattering , rather than mie scattering ( which is independant of wavelength ) .",
    "let us therefore determine whether the measured scattering coefficient is consistent with rayleigh scattering alone ( no mie scattering ) .",
    "as shown by jackson @xcite , in the rayligh limit ( particles much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light ) , the scattering coefficient ( @xmath53 ) for dielectric spheres of radius @xmath63 with dielectric constant @xmath64 in a vacuum is given by :    @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the wavelength of the illuminating light and @xmath67 is the number of spheres per unit volume .",
    "this calculation can be repeated with the spheres in a solvent of dielectric constant @xmath68 to show that the scattering coefficient is then given by :    @xmath69    hence , knowing the way that the scattering coefficient depends upon the wavelength , we can estimate the size of the particles giving rise to scattering .",
    "unfortunately , it is nontrivial to apply this to melanins , since the structure of the fundamental particles is unknown .",
    "this makes determining the number of particles per unit volume challenging .",
    "nevertheless , we can make some assumptions about the structure to determine an estimate of the particle size .    in the absence of a better structural model , it is a fair assumption that eumelanin monomers form approximately spherical particles",
    ". the volume of each particle will be equal to the number of monomers per particle ( @xmath70 ) multiplied by the ` volume of a single monomer ' ( @xmath71 ) which can be estimated to be @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "hence :    @xmath73 the molecular weight of a dihydroxyindole monomer is 149g / mol . the molecular weight of an aggregate will therefore be @xmath74g / mol .",
    "let @xmath75 be the concentration of our solution in weight percent , such that @xmath76 for a solution that is @xmath10 eumelanin by weight .",
    "taking the density of the solvent ( water ) to be @xmath77 , @xmath78 of solution will contain @xmath75 grams of eumelanin , or @xmath79 moles of eumelanin aggregates .",
    "the number of aggregates per @xmath80 of solution will then be given by :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is avogadros number .",
    "applying this to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rayleigh_original ] ) we find :    @xmath83    the dielectric constant for eumelanin ( @xmath64 ) has been measured to be @xmath84 at optical frequencies ( 633 nm ) @xcite .",
    "the dielectric constant for water ( @xmath68 ) is known to be @xmath85 at optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 has been estimated to be @xmath72 , as discussed above . knowing these parameters we can fit the scattering coefficient vs wavelength curve by varying the particle size , @xmath63 .",
    "although we have used several very rough assumptions about the structure of eumelanin , the particle radius is to the third power in the equation for the scattering coefficient .",
    "the scattering is therefore strongly dependant upon the particle size and it can be determined somewhat accurately from a measurement of scattering .    this was done over the range 210 nm to 325 nm where accurate scattering data was available , as shown in figure [ fig : scatwithfit ] .",
    "the best fit was found for a particle radius of @xmath1 nm . the good fit of the data to rayleigh scattering theory suggests that we are in fact measuring scattering , and not another phenomemon ( instrumental or otherwise ) .",
    "this particle size is larger than that predicted by cheng et al .",
    "@xcite , and possibly suggests that the protomolecules further aggregate .",
    "larger particles were measured by vitkin et al . , who report a particle size distribution for a similar sample preparation that has most particles with radii in the range 10 - 70 nm @xcite .",
    "hence an approximate particle size of 38 nm is reasonable .",
    "the integrated scattering of a eumelanin solution was measured as a function of incident wavelength , and found to contribute less than @xmath0 of the optical density between 210 nm and 325 nm .",
    "this means that eumelanin absorption spectra can be interpreted as actual absorption with a high degree of confidence , and allows the calculation of many other optical spectroscopic quantities , such as the radiative quantum yield , without direct subtraction of scattering @xcite .",
    "hence , as long as eumelanin spectroscopic solutions are appropriately prepared and well solubilised , scattering is not a concern . the scattering coefficient vs wavelength",
    "was found to fit rayleigh theory with a particle radius of @xmath1 nm .",
    "this is a larger estimate of the fundamental particle size than those previously reported from x - ray scattering and microscopy studies @xcite , and perhaps indicates that in our samples the fundamental particles have aggregated .",
    "this is consistent with other optical studies @xcite . knowing the physical structure of eumelanin particles is essential for interpretation of spectroscopic results , and therefore for understanding the de - excitation pathways in eumelanin and its biological functionality .",
