    "[ sec : isola ] we briefly discuss a possible extensions of our models that could show isola bifurcation .",
    "several numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo transition occurs via supercritical or subcritical bifurcation . typically , subcritical bifurcations take place for small magnetic prandtl number , while the supercritical ones are observed for large magnetic prandtl numbers  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of our present work is to understand this interesting crossover via low - dimensional models .",
    "we first establish the nature of a subcritical dynamo transition using direct numerical simulations .",
    "we relate a well - known one - dimensional dynamical system ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : combined ] ) ) to dynamo transition and discuss that the subcritical bifurcations require higher - order nonlinearity as compared to the supercritical ones .",
    "this model also explains why the basin of attraction of the dynamo and the no - dynamo states in the numerical simulations are separated by a well - defined boundary .",
    "the scope of the one - dimensional model is however limited , and it does not provide us insights into the role of magnetic prandtl number . therefore we construct more sophisticated dynamo models motivated by the symmetries and the nature of the nonlinearities of the mhd equations .",
    "these models contain crucial higher - order nonlinearities of the form @xmath171 and @xmath172 , which arise due to higher order interactions .",

    "a strong `` stabilising '' influence of the impellers with high magnetic permeability could be one of the primary reasons  @xcite .",
    "we require further analysis to test this conjecture .    in our 3-mode model ,",
    "the dynamo transition depends crucially on the extent of stabilizing and destabilizing terms .",
    "supercritical to subcritical transition takes place when non - linear term similar to the @xmath80 term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : combined ] ) destabilizes the magnetic field which is subsequently stabilized by an even higher order term .",
    "this feature could be similar to the recent findings of sreenivasan and jones  @xcite for the subcritical spherical - shell dynamo in which the lorentz force , which otherwise saturates the magnetic field , destabilizes it .",
    "interestingly , our model is much simpler than that of sreenivasan and jones  @xcite , which includes rotation and complex interplay of helicity .",
    "future investigation of the role of each part ( e.g. , rotation , convection , mhd nonlinearity ) would be very valuable .",
    "in summary , our dynamo model exhibits supercritical and subcritical dynamo transitions .",
    "the model also shows a changeover from supercriticality to subcriticality when the magnetic prandtl number is decreased .",
    "it would be interesting to make quantitative comparisons of the model with realistic dynamos .",
