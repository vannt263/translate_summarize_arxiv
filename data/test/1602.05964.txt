    "superconductivity in cuprate materials still poses many questions that lack a theoretical understanding .",
    "one is about the maximum value of the critical temperature for superconductivity ( @xmath0 ) that could be achieved due to the pairing mechanism , which also concerns the effects that limit @xmath0 in practice .",
    "traditionally , the answer to this question was refined by synthesizing new materials or by changing control parameters such as external pressure .",
    "a new approach is the manipulation of materials properties such as order parameters by driving phonons with light  @xcite .    in the underdoped regime , @xmath0 is presumably limited by the occurrence of a pseudogap .",
    "the nature of this pseudogap state has not yet been clarified , and it is often interpreted as a state with competing orders or preformed pairs .",
    "recent experiments in which the properties of underdoped cuprates are manipulated by driving phonons with light are promising to provide further insights about the physics in the underdoped regime . a series of remarkable experiments reported for example evidence for transient superconducting states induced by light in underdoped yttrium  @xcite ( ybco ) and lanthanum  @xcite ( lco ) based cuprates far above @xmath0 , and even up to room temperature in the former case .    in lanthanum - based cuprates , a transient superconducting state can be induced above @xmath0 around 12% hole doping  @xcite , where superconductivity competes strongly with stripe order . in equilibrium and above @xmath0 ,",
    "stripe order frustrates hopping perpendicular to the copper oxygen layers and destroys interlayer coherence .",
    "stimulation with light leads to a melting of stripe order , which enhances the interlayer coherence and gives rise to a transient superconducting state  @xcite .",
    "the situation for yttrium based compounds  @xcite is less clear . from an experimental point of view",
    ", there is evidence for the melting of a competing order parameter  @xcite , redistribution of interlayer coupling  @xcite and non - equilibrium lattice distortions  @xcite .",
    "evidence also exists for a precursor superconducting state in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "several theories try to explain the transient superconducting state as a product of a redistribution of spectral weight  @xcite or parametric cooling  @xcite of phase fluctuations due to periodic driving , exploiting the bilayer structure of ybco .",
    "an alternative scenario invokes competition between bond - density wave ( bdw ) order and superconductivity in a three - dimensional model , where light modulates the interlayer hopping and influences the competition of orders  @xcite .    in the experiments on ybco ,",
    "the enhancement of superconductivity is observed when mid - infrared light couples resonantly to infrared phonons  @xcite , which in turn excite raman phonons via nonlinear couplings  @xcite .",
    "it thus does not seem to be related to a photo - induced redistribution of quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "the phonon frequencies are mismatched with the plasma resonance and a direct coupling to phase fluctuations seems inefficient .",
    "all three above - mentioned theories have difficulties in explaining why bdw correlations melt and pairing correlations appear on roughly the same time scales , while the disappearance of pairing correlations and the reappearance of bdw correlations happens on very different scales  @xcite . moreover , the proposed mechanisms either make use of the fact that ybco is a bilayer cuprate or the electron hopping perpendicular to the copper oxygen layers plays a prominent role .",
    "it is generally believed that the important physics of cuprate superconductors takes place in the copper oxygen planes , with the spacer layers mainly serving as charge reservoirs .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether light - induced superconductivity could be achieved in a single copper oxygen plane .",
    "this question is intriguing because such a mechanism could also be at work in other cuprate materials that have one or multiple copper oxygen layers per unit cell and where experiments are more difficult .    in this paper we propose a mechanism for light - induced superconductivity based on the competition between bdw correlations and superconductivity , which may be applicable slightly above the equilibrium @xmath0 where the system is close to a bdw instability  @xcite .",
    "we describe the interplay of bdw and pairing fluctuations with a phenomenological non - linear sigma model  @xcite , and investigate the external driving of this model by coupling it to phonons via electrons .",
    "parameter quenches of the non - linear sigma model have been studied by fu  _ et  al . _  in ref .  .",
    "the electrons are described as a fractionalized fermi liquid ( fl@xmath1 )  @xcite , which is a model for the pseudogap state in underdoped cuprates .",
    "it shows bdw correlations at an axial wave vector that connects the tips of fermi arcs  @xcite , as seen in experiment  @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient of our theory is the enhanced coupling of electrons and phonons at the bdw wave vector that is observed in experiments .",
    "it leads to a strong softening of the phonon dispersion  @xcite and a phonon linewidth that increases strongly with decreasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "our theory traces back the enhanced electron - phonon coupling to vertex corrections due to short - range antiferromagnetic fluctuations and explains the phonon renormalization above @xmath0 as being a consequence of strong bdw fluctuations .",
    "however , the enhanced electron - phonon coupling does not directly lead to an enhancement of @xmath0 because it is restricted to a small region in momentum space and certain non - linear couplings between phonons and pairing fluctuations nearly cancel in our model .",
    "instead , the combination of strong phonon softening and phonon anharmonicities allows for the efficient driving of phonons near the bdw wavevector by light pulses .",
    "these strongly driven phonons suppress bdw fluctuations by enhancing their mass , thereby enlarging the relative size of the phase space for pairing , which enhances superconducting correlations .",

    ", our mechanism does not specifically require this model and will work for a generic landau theory of competing orders , since it relies only on the discrepancies in mass renormalizations of different order parameters .",
