    "one of the most important challenges for the realization of quantum information tasks is the implementation of quantum logic gates that are _ robust _ against unwanted perturbations  @xcite .",
    "two kinds of perturbations with qualitatively different features can be distinguished : the first kind has a purely _ quantum _ nature , and it is induced by the interaction of the quantum system implementing the logic gate with the environment ; the second kind has instead a _ classical _ nature , and it is caused by the presence of instrumental noise in the ` external parameters ' used to control the system .",
    "the unwanted interaction with the environment is the source of the phenomenon known as quantum _ decoherence _",
    "the effects of this interaction can be modeled by means of suitable ` master equations ' ( i.e.evolution equations ) for the density matrix of the quantum system implementing the logic gate ; at least in the markovian regime , they are negligibly small if the _ operational time _ of the logic gate is short enough .",
    "the classical perturbations stem from an unavoidable noisy component intrinsic in the external driving fields ( e.g.laser beams  @xcite ) that can be usually regarded as classical fields ; hence , it is essentially due to instrumental instability .",
    "the effects of these perturbations can be evaluated by studying standard ( non - autonomous ) schrdinger equations where the instrumental noise is taken into account by suitably modeling the noisy components of the classical parameters ( e.g.  the field amplitude ) associated with the external driving fields .    among the several strategies for realizing quantum logic gates discussed in the literature , a prominent position is held by _",
    "holonomic gates_. they were first proposed by zanardi and rasetti  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and rely on the theory of holonomy and of the associated holonomy groups in principal fiber bundles  @xcite , a subject which is familiar to theoretical physicists due to the central role played in gauge theories  @xcite and in the well - known phenomenon of abelian  @xcite and non - abelian  @xcite adiabatic phases .",
    "actually , a holonomic gate can be regarded as a straightforward application of the theory of non - abelian adiabatic phases to quantum computation .    since the very beginning , holonomic gates were considered to be intrinsically robust against classical noise  @xcite , thanks to the geometric features of holonomy in hilbert bundles . as we will briefly recall below",
    ", three main ingredients are needed in order to realize such holonomic gates .",
    "+ the first ingredient is a suitable physical system described by a quantum hamiltonian depending on some set of parameters , these parameters being associated with the external ( classical ) driving fields that are assumed to be experimentally controllable functions of time ; the unavoidable instrumental instability ( stochastic noise ) affecting the driving fields is the source of the classical noise  we will call it _ parametric noise _ , in the following  that has been mentioned above .",
    "+ the second ingredient consists in selecting a suitable eigenspace of the given hamiltonian  an eigenspace depending smoothly on the external parameters , hence actually an iso - degenerate family of eigenspaces ; let us call them the family of _ relevant eigenspaces _  and in fixing in the parameter space an ` initial point ' and a loop through this point .",
    "to such a loop corresponds an excursion of the parameter - dependent hamiltonian ( hence , of its eigenprojectors ) and a certain _ ideal unitary transformation _ in the _ encoding eigenspace _ , namely , that particular relevant eigenspace fixed by the initial ( and final ) point of the loop in the parameter space .",
    "this ideal transformation is determined by _",
    "kato s adiabatic evolutor _ associated with the given hamiltonian and with the chosen loop in the parameter space , and it has a simple geometric interpretation as a holonomy phenomenon ( geometric phase ) .",
    "the ideal unitary transformation plays a central role in kato s formulation of the adiabatic theorem  @xcite applied to our context .",
    "indeed , the external parameters are controllable functions of time and in the _ adiabatic limit _ ",
    "i.e. , in the limit where the loop in the parameter space is covered in a operational time tending to infinity  the _ real evolution over the operational time _ , determined by the given physical hamiltonian , becomes _ cyclic _ in the encoding eigenspace and , apart from an irrelevant overall ` dynamical phase factor ' , _ coalesces in this subspace with the ideal unitary transformation_. we stress that the ideal unitary transformation should be thought , in our context , as an _ ideal quantum gate _ whose behavior can be , in general , only approached by a _",
    "non - ideal quantum gate _ corresponding to the real evolution over a suitably large , but finite , operational time .",
    "+ accordingly , the third ingredient is the choice of a suitable operational time  which will be called _ balanced working time _",
    ", in the following  for the real quantum gate .",
    "this time span must be short enough to achieve a fast quantum computer and to avoid the ravages of decoherence , but long enough to justify the adiabatic approximation ( i.e.  to approach the behavior of the ideal quantum gate ) which is at the root of the appearing of geometric phases .",
    "hence , a balanced working time is determined by a touchy trade - off between two competing and not necessarily compatible demands .    the problem of robustness of holonomic gates against parametric noise has been studied in both the abelian and non - abelian case with different approaches  @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the effects of random perturbations of the control parameters are considered .",
    "it is worth noticing , however , that such effects are evaluated with the adiabatic limit already being performed , thus essentially confirming quantitatively the standard qualitative _ geometric argument _ usually adopted to support the robustness of holonomic gates , argument which will be recalled later on .",
    "as holonomic gates are generally considered to be _ a priori _ robust against parametric noise , attention has mainly focused on the study of decoherence effects  @xcite and on the possibility of partially suppressing them  @xcite .",
    "these investigations show that , for certain physical systems and for certain models and regimes of the coupling with the environment , one is able to estimate the typical time - scale within which the effects of decoherence can be neglected . hence one can determine , in principle , a balanced working time for these systems . at this point one should",
    "actually _ check _ whether this balanced working time guarantees a suitable robustness of the quantum gate against parametric noise , namely , whether the effects of this kind of noise on the fidelity of the non - ideal quantum gate with respect to the ideal one can be neglected or not .    recently , a new ingredient has been proposed for the implementation of a holonomic quantum gate  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) where the authors have observed  for the model of a ion - trap quantum gate proposed by duan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite  the existence of a _ optimal working time _ ,",
    "namely , of a specific operational time for which the non - ideal ( i.e.  finite - time ) gate behaves _ exactly _ as the ideal ( i.e.  adiabatic ) gate ; they show , furthermore , that over the optimal working time the effects of the environment are negligible .",
    "thus , such a optimal working time turns out to be also a balanced working time .",
    "+ we stress that , anyway , the fact that the non - ideal gate behaves , in correspondence to the optimal working time , as the ideal one can not be used to rule out the influence of parametric noise on the base of the standard geometric argument .",
    "indeed , one should not expect that , perturbing the loop in the parameter space , the non - ideal gate will still mimic the behavior of the ideal one .",
    "hence one can not apply , in principle , the standard geometric argument to support the robustness of this kind of holonomic gate against parametric noise . a critical analysis of this simple , but somehow subtle , issue is the main aim of the present contribution .    in conclusion , we think that the impact of parametric noise on holonomic gates is still an open problem and one is not legitimated , in general , to state the robustness of non - ideal holonomic gates against this kind of perturbations on the base a generic geometric argument . in our present contribution",
    ", we will try to illustrate this assertion by means of quantitative arguments , focusing on the ion - trap model proposed by duan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . even if other models have been proposed in the literature  @xcite , the model of duan _ et al . _",

    "this geometric character of the dynamics in the adiabatic limit is at the heart of the usual argument in favor of the robustness of holonomic quantum computation . a stochastic noise in the control parameter can modify the details of the loop but , for a sufficiently great number of cycles of the noise during the system evolution",

    "notice that this model of noise acts on both the amplitude and the de - tuning of the lasers . from ( [ monoc_noise ] )",

    "we have considered the case in which only the real part of ( [ monoc_noise ] ) is taken ; in this case the perturbation acts only in the amplitude of the coupling but not in the de - tuning .",

    "we consider a model of noise which preserves the spectrum of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , because of its symmetries an analytical solution of the noisy dynamics is available .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the evolution operator can be evaluated without approximation in several situations . referring to the model in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , it is possible to evaluate the evolution operator along _ any _ segment on the parametric sphere as far as one of the parameters @xmath55 is kept constant . in particular , referring to the case in fig .",
    "[ loop](b ) , the loop is composed by three segments and along each of them the previous condition is satisfied .",
    "thus one can demonstrate  @xcite that the total evolution operator can be splitted in the form @xmath56 where @xmath28 is the total time evolution and @xmath57 are the times needed for covering each segment ( for simplicity we suppose that the speed of the evolution are constant in each segment ) ; moreover , the intermediate @xmath58 s can be explicitly calculated  @xcite .",
    "their form is very peculiar and it is possible to see that , in terms of the parameters @xmath55 , one can write @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the constant values of the parameters during the evolution along the segment @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "we want to use these results for gaining information about the influence of the noise .",
    "we will therefore consider the following model : every @xmath58 is splitted in @xmath67 evolution operators @xmath68 evolving for a time @xmath69 ( a sub - segment ) such that @xmath70 the evolution in the segment @xmath71 reads @xmath72 in each sub - segment one of the sphere parameters is constant and the other evolves ( we are moving on meridians or parallels ) .",

    "this way we have splitted the evolution on a single meridian ( parallel ) in a sequence of evolutions of shorter meridians ( parallels ) . using eq.s ( [ u1])-([decompositionsegment ] ) we can write @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 $ ] are random variables uniformly distributed in the chosen interval ( @xmath76 ) . we stress again that each operator in the decomposition has a ( large and not transparent ) analytical expression . using this model",
    "we have computed the average gate fidelity at the first optimal operational time @xmath18 by means of eq .",

    "we have also analyzed the case of a noise which include de - tuning by considering complex random variables @xmath95 .",

    "the aim of this section is to look for a physical explanation of the observed robustness of the considered finite time non - adiabatic gate . due to the fact that all the models of noise induce the same qualitative behavior of the fidelity , in the following we are going to consider in more details the model presented in sec .",
    "[ random ] .",
    "it is worth to notice that only for the first model the noise affects both the amplitude and the phase of the control parameters , while the other two models of noise concern only their amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , it is a result of  @xcite that the main contribution in the noisy dynamics is due to the component in the amplitude .",
    "as already recalled , the relevant parameter for the geometrical cancellation usually related to holonomic gates in the adiabatic regime is the number of fluctuations of the noise during the gate operational time ( denoted @xmath67 ) .",

    "the fluctuations of the solid angle around the ideal value ( @xmath79 ) start to be negligible for @xmath101 ; a comparison with the curve for the fourth optimal working point ( squares in fig .",
    "[ no - collapse ] ) suggests that the recovery of the fidelity for long cyclic evolution times is given also by geometric cancellation .",
    "for non adiabatic evolution times one can imagine the existence of a different mechanism which accounts for the observed cancellation of the noise effects for sufficiently fast noise which is related to a _ dynamical _ instead of geometrical cancellation .",
    "a dynamical effect could not be directly related to the swept solid angle : in this case the relevant parameter is expected to be the typical time of the noise @xmath102 and a dynamical cancellation of the noise should appear if its typical frequency is sufficiently large compared to the system frequency , namely @xmath103 .",
    "of course this condition implies , for fixed operational time @xmath28 , that @xmath104 ( the usual condition for geometric cancellation ) ; nevertheless , as fig .  [ collapse ] shows , a cancellation of the noise effects appears on a frequency scale @xmath105 _ independently _ of the chosen value of the operational time , thus suggesting a dynamical mechanism for the noise cancellation at least for the first four optimal operational times .",
    "the fact that in the non adiabatic regime the robustness has a dynamical origin can also explain why the minimum value of the fidelity tends to decrease for increasing values of @xmath106 : if the geometric cancellation is not present , the noise is less effective in disturbing the system when the evolution time is short .",
    "in this paper we have considered the influence of parametric noise on the efficiency of a non adiabatic holonomic gate which is known to be robust in the ideal case .",
    "three models of parametric noise have been discussed in the case of finite operational time .",
    "the average gate fidelities for all the models of noise considered here present an analogous qualitative behavior . for each of the three models the non ideal gate presents a breakdown of the average gate fidelity for small frequencies of the noise ( compared to the system bohr frequency ) , while a high value of the fidelity is reached for noise with higher frequencies .",
    "this can lead to say that the presence of a `` resonant frequency '' for the breakdown of @xmath77 is a general feature of any model of parametric noise .",
    "we want to stress again that the usual argument in favor of the robustness of holonomic quantum computation is based on the purely geometric nature of the holonomy group that describes the adiabatic transformations . since the dynamics has a",
    "_ completely _ geometric character _",

    "our conclusion is that , in the range of operational times considered here , the observed cancellation effects are mainly related to a dynamical average over fast oscillations of the noise @xmath107 and there is no relevant connection with the swept solid angle which plays a crucial role for the usual argument in favor of robustness of the holonomic computation in the adiabatic regime .",
