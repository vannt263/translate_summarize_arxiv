    "it is well - established that the best solution of the solar neutrino oscillation is msw - lma ; this is strongly supported by many experiments results@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . for this solution",
    "it is expected that the @xmath0 survival probability in the low energy region ( @xmath11 mev ) is higher than in the high energy region ( @xmath210 mev ) , because for low energies vacuum oscillation is dominant while for high energies matter oscillation is dominant .",
    "so a transition from vacuum to matter oscillation should exist , roughly between 1.0 and 10.0 mev , in the energy range in which solar neutrinos predominate .",
    "the recoil electron energy threshold of super - kamioakande is around 5 mev , so super - kamiokande has a chance to discover the low - energy upturn in the spectrum .    to realize this goal , reducing background and systematic uncertainty below 5.5 mev and lowering the recoil electron energy threshold are important @xcite .",
    "if we can take 5 years of 4 mev threshold data with 70% reduced background below 5.5 mev and half the energy - correlated systematic uncertainty compared to sk - i , we should observe a spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and might discover this energy spectrum distortion .",
    "so , starting with the data of sk - iii , making these detector and analysis improvements has been high priority work .",
    "since the end of sk - i , we have worked hard to reduce background and systematic uncertainties , improving several key items .",
    "the following sections will introduce some of them .",
    "a major background for the solar neutrino observation at sk is the radioactivity from radon ( rn ) in our otherwise extremely pure water .",
    "this ultra - pure water which fills the detector is made from natural mine water using a very high efficiency water purification system .",
    "the rn background events are very similar to solar events , so it is very difficult to remove them using only analysis tools . as a result , many rn events could be included in the final data set .",
    "to reduce this background , the improvement of the rn reduction efficiency of the sk water purification system is the most effective approach .",
    "so , since the end of sk - i we have upgraded the system several times , including the addition of a new heat exchanger and two reverse osmosis units for sk - iii .    in addition , we investigated the water flow in the tank by purposefully injecting radon - enriched water . tracing the resulting background events in time from this injected rn , we found stagnation of water in the top and bottom of the detector volume which increased the background . to counter this effect we installed new pipes and changed the water flow .",
    "previously , the water was supplied from the bottom of the inner detector ( i d ) and drained from the top of both the i d and outer detector ( od ) .",
    "now , it is supplied from the i d bottom and drained from the top and bottom in the i d and od , with a total flow two times faster than before . as a result",
    "we have a central region with half the background ( yellow box in fig . [ figver ] ) as compared with sk - i , making lowering of the energy threshold a possibility .",
    "note that the excessive background near the wall and bottom of sk - iii also existed in sk - ii .",
    "this background is from the fiber reinforced plastic ( frp ) pmt covers which were added at the start of sk - ii in order to protect against propagating shock waves from pmt implosions , and so could not be reduced by improving the water system .",
    "it posed a significant obstacle to enlarging the fiducial volume below 6.5 mev .",
    "the vertex shift , defined as a vector from an averaged position of the reconstructed vertices of the data to that of corresponding monte carlo ( mc ) data , has been one of the main systematic uncertainties for the solar neutrino flux measurement since the beginning of sk - i@xcite . because it could make events move in or out of the fiducial volume",
    ", it is a non - negligible systematic uncertainty .",
    "vertex shift is measured by placing a ni - cf gamma ray source at several positions of the tank .",
    "the reconstructed data vertices were shifted more than 10 cm from the real source position inward toward the tank center , in contrast those of mc which were shifted less than 10 cm .",
    "the origin of the excessive shift of the data was a mystery since sk - i . in sk - iii",
    ", we investigated this mystery , resolving it just ten days before the end of sk - iii .",
    "it turned out that relative hit timing within a wide range ( @xmath3100 nsec ) was not perfect due to characteristics of our electronics .",
    "we measured the timing linearity by artificially shifting the external trigger timing , a common stop signal of individual tdcs for each hit channel .",
    "we found that hit timing should be corrected -0.7@xmath4 to restore linearity .",
    "after the correction was applied the vertex shift shortened significantly ( see fig . [ figversh ] ) . as a result , the background events around the wall ( inside brown ellipse ) were reduced and the fiducial volume between 5.0 and 6.5 mev could be enlarged up to 13.3 kton ( fig .",
    "[ figver_vs ] ) .",
    "in addition , we can apply the same correction for sk - i / ii and expect to reduce the systematic uncertainty of the sk - i / ii data , because the sk - iii daq is the same as that of sk - i / ii .",
    "time variation of data ( black ) and mc ( red ) over the full sk - iii period with fixed water transparency.,width=302 ]     of several positions before and after the position dependent mc installation , width=302 ]    that the water quality in sk changes as a function of time was known ; the sk - i mc took it into account @xcite . in sk - iii",
    "we also measured the time variation of the water transparency using @xmath5-@xmath6 decay data , as well as the wavelength dependence of various scattering and absorption water coefficients using a nitrogen / dye laser system @xcite .    using the full period of sk - iii , we investigated possible relationships among the water transparency and water coefficients and found , similar to sk - i",
    ", the only apparent connection was between water transparency and the absorption coefficients .",
    "so we installed the absorption coefficients as a function of the water transparency measured by @xmath5-@xmath6 decay data and the scattering coefficients as a constant for the water transparency . as a result",
    "we had a time dependent mc .",
    "we tested this mc with muon decay data .",
    "figure [ figtimdecaye ] shows the @xmath7 time variation of data and mc in sk - iii assuming a fixed water transparency .",
    "@xmath7 is the effective number of hits to yield the same value at any position in the sk tank by applying several corrections to the number of hits @xcite .",
    "one such correction takes into account the water transparency . to observe the effect of the time variation of water transparency directly",
    ", we did nt apply this correction , and confirmed that mc tracks the data properly .",
    "we also found a position dependence in the water quality .",
    "the existence of position dependence due to the water flow has been debated since sk - i .",
    "we installed light injectors on the barrel of the detector and tried to find it , but this method could nt resolve the question .",
    "finally , in sk - iii , using several calibration sources we concluded that position dependence not only exists but also changes as a function of time .",
    "so we made a position dependent mc by installing a z - dependence in the water coefficients varied by the so - called top - bottom asymmetry as measured using calibration data over the full sk - iii data - taking period .",
    "we tested this mc with calibration data @xcite .",
    "we took the data at several positions(fig .",
    "[ figdtp ] ) . before correction",
    "the difference between data and mc was @xmath33% at the top of the detector , @xmath32% in the center , and @xmath31% at the bottom , but after correction was less than 1% at the top and in the center .",
    "however , the difference at the bottom became larger ; it still needs improvement .",
    "another large source of systematic uncertainty in sk - i is the angular resolution @xcite .",
    "because this uncertainty comes essentially from the hit pattern difference between data and mc , we must tune the mc to reduce the uncertainty .",
    "the mc was tuned several times .",
    "daq - related items like single photoelectron response , timing resolution , etc . , and optical properties like scattering and absorption coefficients , the reflectance of pmts , etc . , were tuned using several calibration sources , as was done for sk - i @xcite .",
    "when we calculated the difference of the angular resolution of data and mc , their agreement was not improved compared with sk - i .",
    "so we explored several optical properties using mc , finally finding that halving the original value for the reflectivity of a black sheet which covers the i d wall gave better agreement . until that time we used the sk - ii value for black sheet reflectivity ,",
    "even though the materials of sk - ii / iii black sheet are different .",
    "to confirm this finding , we put a light injector with a black sheet reflector into the sk tank and measured the amount of direct light and reflected light for specific incident angles .",
    "figure [ example_black ] shows the ratio of the amount of charge due to reflected light versus direct light of data ( black ) and half reflectivity mc ( red ) .",
    "this shows reasonable agreement , even if the 337 nm result ( upper figure ) still needs tuning .",
    "next , we improved the direction fitter itself .",
    "in essence , the likelihood function that represents the distribution of the opening angle between the particle direction and the vector from the reconstructed vetex to the hit pmt position was improved . in sk - i it was made for 10 mev mc electrons @xcite , while for sk - iii several energy bins were considered . as a result , we achieved about 10% better angular resolution around 5 mev than in sk - i ( fig .",
    "[ example_veres ] ) .",
    "in addition to the above efforts , we retuned most of the reconstruction tools and reduction criteria to reduce their systematic uncertainties .",
    "we are continuing to tune those items whose tuning results were nt sufficiently good , as mentioned in the previous sections .",
    "as the determination of our systematic errors is still under way , we ca nt show the exact numbers of the systematic uncertainties yet .",
    "as a result of the above efforts , we took good solar neutrino data during the full super - kamiokande - iii data - taking period , which ran from august of 2006 through august of 2008 .",
    "currently 298 live days of data with a lower total energy threshold of 4.5 mev is finished being analyzed .",
    "this section shows the following new solar neutrino results for this data set :    * observed @xmath8 flux in sk - iii * angular distributions * @xmath8 flux time variation * recoil electron energy spectrum * day / night asymmetry    but the 4.5 - 5.0 mev energy bin still needs additional mc tuning , so for the flux calculation we did nt include this bin .",
    "we have only quoted statistical errors , since the estimation of the systematic uncertainties is nt finished .",
    "solar neutrinos traversing sk occasionally interact with bound electrons of water molecules .",
    "these @xmath8-@xmath6 interactions are elastic scattering , and their incident neutrino and a recoil electron directions are highly correlated . fig .",
    "[ example_figure ] shows the @xmath9 distribution of solar neutrino event candidates where @xmath10 is the angle between the recoil electron direction and the direction from the sun ; a sharp peak around 1.0 is observed . using the same method as sk - i @xcite , we extracted the solar neutrino signal from this distribution .",
    "the best - fit value for the number of signal events between 5.0 mev and 20.0 mev is @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 flux is @xmath12 is consistent with sk - i / ii values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 within the statistical error .",
    "[ subsecflux ] showed the angular distribution of all events between 5.0 and 20.0 mev .",
    "this section will focus on the angular distributions of the lowest energy bins .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ example_figure_col2 ] shows the 5.0 - 5.5 , 5.5 - 6.0 and 6.0 - 6.5 mev regions . for these energy bins ,",
    "the fiducial volume ( 13.3 kton ) is smaller than that ( 22.5 kton ) of higher energy bins , because of the large number of background events from the i d wall ( sec .",
    "[ subsecws ] ) . as a result of the effort described in sec .",
    "[ seccur ] , the background level in sk - iii became lower than that of sk - i , especially below 6.0 mev where it has been cut by one half .",
    "moreover , the solar peak of sk - iii is sharper than that of sk - i . in other words ,",
    "the improved direction fitter ( sec .",
    "[ subsecar ] ) has made sk - iii s angular resolution better than sk - i s .",
    "next , we d like to report a new low energy bin of 4.5 - 5.0 mev . as a result of improvement of the sk water purification system",
    ", we were able to achieve the 4.5 mev recoil electron energy threshold .",
    "though high background from the i d wall make this fiducial volume ( 9.0 kton ) much smaller than that of higher energy ranges , the low background in the central detector region provides a possibility to analyze the 4.5 - 5.0 mev region ; we have observed the solar signal in this energy bin .",
    "figure [ example_angle2 ] shows the angular distribution of this region .",
    "because of the huge background rate and insufficient exposure , at first glance the solar peak is nt readily apparent , but the fitting result was good .",
    "still , due to the remaining work we can not quote the exact flux number yet .",
    "the time or seasonal variation of the total flux since the start of sk - i is shown in fig .",
    "[ example_time ] .",
    "the size of each horizontal bin is 1.5 months .",
    "the variation agrees well with a sinusoidal trend consistent with the expected @xmath15 variations in sk - i data due to the eccentricity of the earth s orbit around the sun .",
    "contribution.,width=302 ]    figure [ example_spec ] shows the ratios of the expected ( normalized by the sk - i best fit ) mc and measured recoil electron energy spectra of sk - i / ii / iii .",
    "the dotted lines are the average data / mc ratios and the green bands represent statistical error .",
    "the red areas indicate the expected @xmath8 contribution from the sk - i best fit and the white areas under the dotted lines are the @xmath16 @xmath8 contributions .",
    "we can confirm that sk - i / ii / iii are statistically consistent ; even though sk - iii has lower backgrounds below 6.5 mev , statistical errors are bigger .",
    "the day / night asymmetry(@xmath17 ) is the only direct test of matter effects on the solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "this value is obtained from @xmath18 , where d and n are the day and night fluxes measured by selecting events which occur when the cosine of the solar zenith angle is less than zero ( day ) and greater than zero ( night ) , respectively . in sk - i it was measured as @xmath19 , and also fitted as @xmath20 , and in sk - ii measured as @xmath21 . in sk - iii",
    "it can be measured to 4.3%(stat . ) with the shown 298 days of data , and perhaps to 3.7%(stat . ) using the entire sk - iii data set including periods of high threshold or high background runs .",
    "if so , then using the combined sk - i / ii / iii data can determine it to 1.6%(stat . ) and fit variations to 1.3%(stat . ) .",
    "we achieved lower backgrounds below 6.0 mev in the center of sk , and have almost finished analyzing sk - iii data .",
    "we are trying to reduce systematic errors compared to sk - i and the estimation of these systematic errors is under way .",
    "our sk - iii results are consistent with the sk - i / ii results within statistical uncertainties . at sk - iii ,",
    "the recoil electron energy threshold was lowered to 4.5 mev . with existing data , sk is statistically sensitive down to lma day / night asymmetries of 1.3% .",
