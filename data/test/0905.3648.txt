    "the atlas experiment @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite must be synchronized to the collisions to ensure the quality of the event data recorded by its sub - detectors . in order to facilitate this",
    ", the lhc provides beam related timing signals to the experiments via optical fibers that are several kilometers long @xcite .",
    "the phase of these clock signals can drift , e.g. due to temperature fluctuations , causing front - end electronics to sample at non - optimal working point . on both sides of atlas , 175 m upstream from the interaction point , beam pick - up detectors are installed along the lhc beam pipe .",
    "this paper describes how these detectors are used    * to monitor the phase between the collisions and the lhc clock signals that drive the atlas electronics * to monitor the structure and uniformity of the lhc beams * as input to the trigger system",
    "[ fig : bptxstation ]    the bptx stations are beam position monitors provided by the lhc machine , but operated by experiments for timing purposes .",
    "they are comprised of four electrostatic button pick - up detectors , arranged symmetrically in the transverse plane around the lhc beam pipe .",
    "since the signal from a passing charge distribution is linearly proportional to distance to first order , the signals from all four pick - ups are summed to cancel out potential beam position deviations .",
    "the resulting signal is then transmitted to the underground counting room _ usa15 _ via a 220 m low - loss cable .",
    "figure  [ fig : bptxstation ] shows the installed bptx station for beam 2 on the c - side of atlas . at the bottom of the photograph , the cables from the four button pick - ups are visible",
    "the bptx signals are used for two separate purposes within atlas , by the trigger system and by a monitoring system for the lhc beams and timing signals .",
    "figure  [ fig : bptxcontextdiagram ] shows the bptx system and how it interacts with the related systems @xcite .",
    "the optical timing signals from the lhc arrive in the underground counting room to a receiver module , the ` rf2ttc ` .",
    "this module converts the optical signals to _",
    "_ ttc _ _ signals and can also manipulate their phase , duration etc . if needed .",
    "the electrical signals are then transmitted to the atlas sub - detectors via the _ central trigger processor _ ( ctp ) of the level-1 trigger system and to the bptx monitoring system .",
    "the atlas trigger system is designed in three levels , each level sequentially refining the selection of events to be saved for further offine analysis .",
    "the level-1 trigger is implemented in custom electronics and performs a first selection of events within 2.5 @xmath0s , based primarily on reduced - granularity data from the calorimeters and the muon spectrometer .",
    "the selected events are processed further by the _",
    "high level trigger _",
    "system which is implemented in software .",
    "the signals from the bptx stations are discriminated with a constant - fraction discriminator to provide atlas with an accurate and reliable timing reference in the form of a standard nim pulse .",
    "this pulse is fed into the level-1 _ central trigger processor _ where it serves as a trigger condition indicating a bunch passing through atlas .",
    "furthermore , the bptx detectors are used by a stand - alone monitoring system for the lhc bunches and timing signals .",
    "the bptx and lhc timing signals are digitized by a deep - memory , high sampling rate ( 5ghz ) oscilloscope and transferred to a computer running linux for analysis .",
    "the features of the scope enables capturing a full lhc turn in one acquisition while retaining enough detail to get about 5 measurement points on the sharp falling edge of each bptx pulse ( see e.g. figure  [ fig : firstbunch ] ) . since most of the high - frequency content of the bptx signals is attenuated by the long transmission line , the frequency spectrum of the signals arriving in atlas peaks around 400 mhz , making an analog bandwidth of 600 mhz sufficient for the oscilloscope used for digitization . by making fits to the identified bunch pulses and clock edges , the bptx monitoring system measures the phase between each bunch and the clock signal with high accuracy .",
    "monitoring these quantites is crucial to guarantee a stable phase relationship for optimal signal sampling in the subdetector front - end electronics .",
    "in addition to monitoring this phase , the intensity and longitudinal length of the individual bunches are measured and the structure of the beams is determined .",
    "using the bptx monitoring applications , the shifter in the control room can verify that the timing signals are synchronized to the collisions , and also look for so - called _ satellite bunches _ , out - of - time bunches that would cause off - center collisions in atlas .",
    "the monitoring system is running independently from the atlas online data acquisition infrastructure , enabling monitoring of the lhc machine in the control room even when atlas is not taking data .",
    "summary data from the bptx monitoring system , e.g. mean bunch intensity and phase , is published to the atlas _ _ detector control system__@xcite and ultimately saved to the conditions database .",
    "on september 10 , 2008 , the first lhc proton bunch reached atlas .",
    "figure [ fig : firstbunch ] shows the pulse recorded by the bptx monitoring system .",
    "a few hours later , a bunch was successfully circulated 8 turns around the accelerator and seen by atlas as depicted in figure  [ fig:8turns ] .",
    "the pulses are separated by 89@xmath0s , corresponding to the time it takes for an lhc bunch to circulate around the 27 km long ring .",
    "the pulse amplitude , which is proportional to the bunch intensity , is degrading from turn to turn , which is consistent with the beam loss and debunching expected for a beam not yet captured by the lhc rf system .          around 1 am on september 12 , 2008",
    ", a single bunch was circulated around the lhc for about 20 minutes after being captured by the rf system .",
    "the bptx monitoring system measured the intensity during this period , and the resulting plot is shown in figure  [ fig : longfill ] .",
    "it should be noted that this is a relative but not yet normalized intensity measurement .",
    "the scattering of the data points suggests that the precision is around 10% .",
    "figure  [ fig : persistency ] shows an oscilloscope picture recorded in persistency mode during the same time period .",
    "the falling edge of the analog bptx signal for beam 2 ( the scope channel with bipolar pulses to the left ) is used as scope trigger and can be seen together with the discriminated bptx signal used as level-1 trigger input ( with longer nim pulse to the right ) .",
    "the clock related to beam 2 ( bottom ) is stable within an rms of 40 picoseconds with respect to the beam , indicating rf capture .",
    "the reference clock signal ( top ) , corresponding to the bunch frequency at a higher energy , has a different frequency .",
    "in the first period of beam in the lhc , the bptx system was used extensively as a trigger to time in the read - out windows of the sub - detectors of the atlas experiment .",
    "the bptx monitoring system was able to record the very first lhc bunch approaching atlas , and provided detailed information about the beams during these first days of data taking .",
    "the authors would like to thank the atlas collaboration and its level-1 central trigger group in which most of this work was carried out .",
    "we would also like to express our deepest gratitude to the lhc community , both for the support and for providing the bptx detectors .    00",
