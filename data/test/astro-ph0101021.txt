    "the identification and study of very cool white dwarf ( wd ) stars is important for understanding the evolution of wds , their luminosity function , their space density , and their total formation rate .",
    "this study is particularly important for wds in the galactic halo , because they are sufficiently old that most are expected to have cooled to very low temperatures @xcite . until recently , the coolest wds known had temperatures @xmath04000  k ( bergeron et al .  1997 ; leggett et al .",
    "the discovery @xcite of two wds that definitely have temperatures below 4000  k has shown that such cool wds do exist and has added impetus for further searches .",
    "very cool wds will have molecular hydrogen in their atmospheres if any hydrogen is present . in these high - density atmospheres , collisions can induce a temporary electric dipole moment in the hydrogen molecules .",
    "calculations predict ( borosow et al .",
    "1989 ; lenzuini et al . 1991 ; saumon et al . 1994 ; borosow et al .",
    "1997 ) a high opacity at infrared wavelengths , referred to as collision - induced absorption ( cia ) .",
    "this opacity produces a spectral energy distribution with greatly depressed red / infrared flux that should result in distinctive colors ( bergeron et al .",
    "1995a ; bergeron et al .",
    "1997 ; hansen & phinney 1998 ; hansen 1998 ; hansen 1999 ; saumon & jacobson 1999 ; chabrier 1999 ) . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "@xcite should be especially effective at identifying such stars @xcite .",
    "this survey is obtaining deep ccd images of 10,000 deg@xmath1 of the north galactic cap in five photometric bands ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) to a limiting magnitude @xmath7  see fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and appendix a of fan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for details of the photometric system .",
    "this paper describes the first such star found by sdss in its commissioning data .",
    "this star appears to have stronger cia and , therefore , is probably cooler than the two previously known sub-4000  k wds .",
    "in addition , the rediscovery of lhs  3250 , previously the wd with strongest cia , is reported . both ( re)discoveries indicate that sdss can find other similar stars .",
    "imaging data from the sdss 2.5 m telescope and its survey camera @xcite now include most of the equatorial stripe with @xmath8 and outside of the galactic plane , as well as a number of scans away from the equator .",
    "the two stars reported here are a new white dwarf , sdssp j133739.40 + 000142.8 ( hereafter referred to as sdss 1337 + 00 ; `` p '' indicates that the coordinates are preliminary ) , and lhs  3250 @xcite .",
    "they were imaged on 1999 march 21 and 2000 april 04 , respectively .",
    "their positions , proper motions , and magnitudes are given in table  1 magnitudes are on the ab system ( lupton et al . 1999 ) , and errors are internal .",
    "only preliminary colors and magnitudes are available , until the sdss photometric system has been established ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are used to designate these preliminary values .",
    "final magnitudes and colors are not likely to change by much more than a few hundredths .",
    "note , the difference between @xmath11 magnitudes and traditional logarithmic magnitudes is negligible at these magnitudes well above the survey limits . ] . a finding chart for sdss 1337 + 00",
    "is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the proper motion is derived from the sdss position and the position in the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite measured on the palomar observatory sky survey o and e plates taken in 1952 . for comparison ,",
    "table  1 also includes data taken from the literature @xcite for the cool wd wd0346 + 246 .",
    "magnitudes in the sdss system and in the johnson / cousins / cit system are included in table  1 , where some of the values not observed directly have been transformed from the other system using predicted relations for normal stars @xcite .",
    "these estimated values are probably accurate to better than 0.1 mag .",
    "the @xmath12 magnitude limit for sdss 1337 + 00 was kindly obtained by f.  vrba with the usno 1.55 m telescope and aladdin insb array detector .",
    "the colors of sdss 1337 + 00 and lhs  3250 are highly unusual , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "they are plotted along with a sample of normal wds with synthesized sdss colors @xcite , and with observed j magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the two curves show the colors of h and he wd model atmospheres @xcite with log  @xmath13 ( kindly calculated and made available to us by pierre bergeron ) .",
    "the deviation of the spectral energy distributions of these two stars from normal white dwarfs and non - degenerate stars is dramatic .",
    "1337 + 00 has colors in figure 2(b ) and 2(c ) even more extreme than those for lhs  3250 .    spectroscopic `` plates '' ( exposures with fiber configurations covering the 3-degree field of view ) are taken by sdss after imaging data are available  objects ( primarily galaxies and qso candidates ) are selected for observation based on their image morphology and colors .",
    "qsos with redshift @xmath14 have @xmath15 colors @xcite similar to those predicted for very cool wds . objects with such colors will be selected as high - redshift qso candidates , and those brighter than @xmath16 will be given high priority for spectroscopic observation as qso targets .",
    "they also will be selected as cool - wd candidates , but given lower priority for spectra . both sdss 1337 + 00 and",
    "lhs  3250 were allocated fibers as qso candidates .",
    "the two sdss fiber spectrographs cover 3800 - 9200    at a spectral resolution of 1800 .",
    "the exposure time is 45  min under optimum observing conditions , or more as necessary to reach a target s / n .",
    "the spectra are extracted and calibrated with an automated software pipeline ( frieman et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the spectra of sdss 1337 + 00 and lhs  3250 were taken on 2000 may 07 ( plate 0299 , 75 min exposure ) and 2000 may 28 ( plate 0349 , 90 min exposure ) , respectively .",
    "they have been smoothed to 6    resolution , and are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the spectrum of lhs  3250 has been scaled to match that of sdss 1337 + 00 for ease of comparison ; it agrees quite well with the spectrum previously published @xcite .",
    "there are no significant features in the spectrum of either star .",
    "the spectra show that sdss  1337 + 00 has relatively less flux at red - infrared wavelengths , consistent with the colors shown in figure  2 .",
    "the low flux at red - infrared wavelengths in sdss  1337 + 00 appears similar to that in lhs  3250 but more pronounced .",
    "the most viable explanation is that we are seeing cia from molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "less extreme cia is also seen in wd0346 + 246 @xcite , and possibly in lhs  1126 @xcite and f351 - 50 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of cia in these stars represents a striking confirmation of the qualitative trends expected from theoretical model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "figure  4 compares the spectrum of sdss  1337 + 00 with models of pure hydrogen atmospheres at three cool temperatures .",
    "the discrepancy between the models and the observed spectrum is most likely the result of missing opacities in the theoretical models , as well as the likelihood of the admixture of helium into the hydrogen atmosphere to provide additional h@xmath17-he cia @xcite .",
    "improvements to both the atmosphere models and the theoretical opacity inputs are underway . for example , new models with low temperatures and mixed ( helium - dominated ) composition @xcite show the sensitivity of cia and the output spectrum to the input assumptions .",
    "however , these new models only explore a few compositions out of many plausible possibilities ; they still do not give improved fits to the spectra in figure  2 .",
    "until further improved models are available , we can only deduce broad constraints on the effective temperature .",
    "the fact that the h@xmath17 cia is strong suggests the objects are somewhat cooler than 4000  k. while temperatures below 3000  k can not be ruled out , such low temperatures imply cooling ages for some ranges of mass that exceed reasonable estimates for the age of the galaxy ( see section 4 ) , so a temperature range 3000 - 4000  k is suggested .",
    "much recent attention has been devoted to the existence of halo wds , motivated by microlensing @xcite and optical @xcite observations , and a few wds are known to be halo stars @xcite .",
    "are these two very cool wds part of the halo population ?",
    "the proper motion and distance of wd0346 + 246 give a tangential velocity of 175  km  s@xmath18 , indicating that star is indeed a halo object @xcite .",
    "however , the proper motion of lhs  3250 is smaller ( v@xmath19 = 81  km  s@xmath18 ) and is consistent with membership in either the disk or the halo ; meanwhile , its luminosity is not as low as expected for a presumably very old halo wd .",
    "the proper motion of sdss  1337 + 00 is smaller yet . if it has an absolute magnitude similar to that of lhs  3250 ( @xmath20 = 15.7 ) , then its distance will be about 54  pc and v@xmath19 will be 46  km  s@xmath18 . alternatively ,",
    "if it has the lower luminosity ( @xmath21 ) expected for a conventional , 0.6-@xmath22 wd cooling to a temperature where cia becomes strong , then its distance will be about 20  pc and v@xmath19 will be only 17  km  s@xmath18 . in either case ( pending a parallax measurement )",
    ", these two coolest wds do not have the properties expected for halo stars .    to properly constrain the nature of these objects",
    ", we must consider not only wds with conventional c / o cores , but also the known population of low mass ( @xmath23 or less ) helium core wds found in binaries @xcite .",
    "such objects are the result of truncated stellar evolution in close binaries @xcite and cool more slowly ( for similar masses ) as a result of the increased heat capacity of the helium core .",
    "figure  5 shows the cooling time for wds with hydrogen atmospheres ( hansen 1999 ; see also benvenuto & althaus 1999 , chabrier et al .",
    "2000 , salaris et al .",
    "conventional wds ( @xmath24 ) require ages @xmath258.5  gyr to cool to 4000  k. wds more massive than average can cool somewhat faster at late times due to the earlier onset of core crystallization .",
    "the aforementioned low mass helium core wds can potentially cool below 4000  k much faster .",
    "a 0.23 @xmath22 helium core wd may cool below 4000  k in @xmath06  gyr .",
    "( note that very low mass wds may possess thick hydrogen envelopes and thus will cool more slowly , with a contribution to their luminosity from residual hydrogen burning @xcite .",
    "if true , this will cause the curves shown in figure  5 to turn upwards again below @xmath26 . )",
    "further progress requires that we determine a temperature or a radius , because the luminosity is known ( or soon will be , after the parallax of sdss 1337 + 00 is measured ) .",
    "the radius varies from @xmath27  cm for the @xmath28 model , to @xmath29 cm for the @xmath30 model , so the luminosity at fixed temperature varies by a factor of 7 between these two possibilities .",
    "fitting the spectrum with models may give very accurate temperatures when the models are improved ( section 3 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of lhs  3250 ( @xmath31 ) suggests a low mass , helium core wd as the most likely of the above options . in many respects",
    "sdss  1337 + 00 is similar  the proper motion and apparent magnitude are both consistent with it being an lhs  3250 analog , but slightly cooler , at two to three times the distance .",
    "both stars are more likely to belong to the old disk or thick disk populations than to the halo .",
    "most wds have masses @xmath24 .",
    "both low mass and high mass wds are minority constituents .",
    "thus it seems surprising that such potentially anomalous wds are among the first cool wds found in the sdss survey .",
    "this may , in part , be due to the strong color selection involved .",
    "wds are only selected for spectroscopic follow - up if they appear to lie outside the main stellar locus in the @xmath32 passbands .",
    "thus , the accelerated evolution to low temperatures at the high- and low - mass ends of the distribution may favor their detection .",
    "identifying cool wds with temperatures about 3500 - 4500  k that do not have such strong cia is more difficult .",
    "transition stars like wd0346 + 246 may be found using a combination of visible and near - infrared colors , or using an intermediate - band filter to find stars with no mgh absorption feature @xcite , and then doing follow - up spectroscopy . with spectroscopic plates taken and examined covering roughly 400 square degrees of sky ,",
    "we have found two cool wds ( one previously known ) .",
    "thus we might expect to find at least several tens in the full sdss survey .",
    "we are grateful to f. vrba for obtaining the j magnitude limit of sdss 1337 + 00 .",
