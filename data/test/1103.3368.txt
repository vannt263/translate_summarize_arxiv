    "the transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) is a quantum critical phenomenon , which was predicted theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite a few decades ago .",
    "although experimentally there is no a priori reason to neglect electron - electron interactions , it is usually modelled theoretically by noninteracting particles in two dimensions ( 2d ) , in a perpendicular magnetic field and a random potential . despite the apparent simplicity of this conceptual setup",
    ", it turns out to be very difficult to derive analytically the critical exponents of this transition .",
    "important progress was achieved by the introduction of a simple network model which retains the salient features of guiding centre motion and quantum tunnelling in the presence of disorder : the chalker - coddington ( cc ) model  @xcite .",
    "extensive numerical studies based on the cc model or other approaches have led to good estimates for the critical exponents , notably the correlation - length exponent @xmath5  @xcite ( a larger value @xmath6 has also been reported  @xcite ) . also , a semi - classical argument  @xcite yields the prediction @xmath7 .",
    "the cc model is also the starting point for several analytical approaches , like the description by a @xmath8-model  @xcite , or a mapping to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum many - body system  @xcite .",
    "however , from the point of view of critical lattice models , no exact solution of the cc model has been found so far .",
    "the situation is very different for the _ spin _ quantum hall effect ( sqhe ) : the generalisation of the cc model to sqhe  @xcite ( which we shall call @xmath9-cc ) maps exactly to classical bond percolation , where a large class of exponents are known  @xcite .",
    "this mapping of @xmath9-cc to classical percolation was first observed by gruzberg _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used a supersymmetric ( susy ) spin - chain formulation .",
    "later on , it was realised  @xcite that the susy _ lattice path integral _",
    "maps @xmath9-cc to a statistical model of lattice paths , which are exactly the hulls of bond - percolation clusters .",
    "moreover , a number of sqhe physical observables are expressed in terms of percolation correlation functions , and this mapping is valid even at the level of lattice models .    in this paper , we propose a treatment of the original cc model based on the lattice path integral .",
    "since the corresponding statistical model involves paths which may pass through a given edge infinitely many times , the number of configurations per unit surface is infinite , and the model is not directly tractable by exact - solution methods such as yang - baxter integrability and conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "we therefore introduce a _ truncation procedure _ , leading to a series of finite statistical models , and focus on the first order of truncation .",
    "the arising model is a two - colour loop model including vacancies , and with loop fugacity @xmath4 .",
    "integrable multi - colour loop models have been known for a long time  @xcite .",
    "they were originally defined through multi - dimensional height models , but they may as well describe coupled copies of classical magnetism models , such as the potts or @xmath10 models , and also the ground state of _ quantum _ loop models . more specifically , in a two - colour , completely packed ( _ i.e. _ without vacancies ) loop model  @xcite , new integrable points were identified through a mapping to a braid - monoid algebra : the birman - wenzl - murakami ( bwm ) algebra  @xcite . in the present paper , we use a similar approach on the loop model arising from our truncation procedure , which is a two - colour loop model including vacancies . generalising to arbitrary loop fugacity @xmath0",
    ", we obtain four critical branches in the phase diagram of this loop model .",
    "we then study the critical properties of these branches .",
    "we find that two of these regimes ( denoted 1 and 2 ) correspond to a pair of decoupled coulomb - gas ( cg ) theories , whereas the other two ( 3 and 4 ) relate to the @xmath1 wess - zumino - witten coset model , for values @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "we obtain analytically two critical exponents : one of them , @xmath13 , corresponds to an elliptic deformation of the integrable weights , and the other one , @xmath14 , is associated to a perturbation of the weight per monomer .",
    "the truncated , modified cc model is realised by the @xmath4 point of regime 4 , but this point is outside the validity range for the analytic continuation of the wzw exponents .",
    "our numerical study gives the estimate @xmath15 for the correlation - length exponent , and @xmath16 for the fractal dimension of paths .",
    "this is clearly incompatible with the iqhe universality class , and hence our integrable two - colour loop model is only a crude approximation to iqhe .",
    "however , the truncation procedure may be carried out to higher orders , possibly yielding more accurate , solvable approximations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the definition of the cc model and its lattice susy path - integral formulation , and explain our truncation procedure , resulting in a two - colour loop model .",
    "this truncation is compared in detail with the one used in  @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we use a mapping to a dilute braid - monoid algebra to derive the integrable boltzmann weights of the two - colour loop model , as well as the corresponding 1d hamiltonian . in section 4",
    ", we identify the four critical regimes of the integrable model and the corresponding cfts . numerical and analytical support for the identification of these cfts",
    "is given . in section 5 ,",
    "we examine in more detail regime 4 , which contains the truncated , modified cc model at @xmath4 .",
    "we discuss the analytic continuation of cft results , and estimate numerically some critical exponents , including the correlation - length exponent @xmath17 .",
    "the paper has three appendices .",
    "appendix a contains the details of the mapping to the dilute bwm ( dbwm ) algebra used in section 3 . in appendix b",
    ", we exhibit a lattice holomorphic parafermion @xmath18 in the integrable model . in appendix c",
    ", we expose the exact solution of a particular point in regime 4 , which is mapped to free fermions .",
    "this mapping provides a valuable check on our results , and also gives a proof that the @xmath19 loop model has central charge @xmath20 .",
    "the chalker - coddington model  @xcite is a simple lattice model for the iqhe .",
    "the latter consists of a two - dimensional gas of non - interacting electrons in a disordered medium , subject to a strong transverse magnetic field . in the presence of the random potential ,",
    "the landau levels are broadened , and eigenenergies are of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an integer , @xmath23 is the cyclotron energy of the electron in the magnetic field , and @xmath24 is a random part . let us recall briefly the main ingredients of the cc model .",
    "we consider an electron in the eigenstate of energy @xmath25 .",
    "the spatial trajectories of the electron over finite time steps @xmath26 are modelled by paths on the directed square lattice @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cc - def ] ) , and the time - evolution operator over @xmath26 is denoted @xmath28 .",
    "the operator @xmath28 reads @xmath29 with two types of factors :    * on each directed edge @xmath30 , the operator @xmath31 takes the particle along @xmath30 and multiplies the wavefunction by a random aharonov - bohm phase @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 are independent and uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath34 $ ] .",

    "in particular , the correlation - length exponent @xmath44 , defined by the scaling of the correlation length @xmath45 has been estimated as  @xcite @xmath46          the problem of solving the cc model amounts to the diagonalisation of a random time - evolution operator .",

    "paths configurations are weighted by the elements of the vertex @xmath78-matrix , and an additional factor @xmath79 .",
    "note that closed loops have a vanishing weight , because the bosonic and fermionic contributions cancel each other .      in the form  , @xmath71 can be viewed as a two - point correlation function in a classical , two - dimensional statistical model for two - colour path configurations .",
    "no approximation has been introduced so far , and thus is identical to the value of @xmath71 in the original cc model .",
    "the main difficulty in evaluating is that the paths @xmath80 may go through a given edge an arbitrary number of times @xmath77 , and thus the statistical model has an infinite number of degrees of freedom per edge .",
    "this type of problem is not usually tractable by exact solution methods , so we need to _ truncate _ the statistical model to a finite loop model in order to use these methods .",
    "this is very analogous to what nienhuis did for the @xmath10 spin model  @xcite on the hexagonal lattice : in that context , the spin model with variables @xmath81 was formally mapped to a polygon model where edges could be used an arbitrary number of times , but the substitution @xmath82 in the edge interaction led to a finite loop model , while preserving the @xmath10 symmetry of the original spin model .",
    "the truncation we propose consists in keeping only the terms of   with @xmath83 , _",
    "i.e. _ the configurations where each of the paths @xmath84 visits an edge at most once .",
    "this preserves the boson / fermion supersymmetry , ensuring that closed loops still have a vanishing weight in the truncated model .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "in the original expression   for the action on the edges , we can imagine choosing a different fugacity @xmath85 for each edge ( so that it now appears inside the summation over @xmath30 . )",
    "this does not affect the supersymmetry of the action .",
    "on expanding in powers of all the @xmath85 , the bosonic contribution to a given edge now enters with a factor @xmath86 .",
    "thus our truncation to @xmath87 amounts to keeping only the terms up to first order in the expansion of the partition function in powers of @xmath88 , and then setting all the @xmath89 again .. note that to this order we have either nothing , or a pair of bosons of different flavours ( 1 and 2 ) , or a pair of fermions of different flavours , propagating along each edge .",
    "the supersymmetry ensures that each closed loop is counted with weight @xmath90 . at this stage",
    "it is simpler to switch to a replica formulation rather than using supersymmetry explicitly : we have a model with two flavours of boson , such that each edge is either unoccupied , or occupied by each flavour exactly once .",

    "the vertices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc - model ] .",

    "for example , at @xmath91 we would have either 2 pairs of bosons of each flavour , or 1 pair of bosons and 1 pair of fermions .",
    "( we can never have more than one pair of fermions because the grassmann variables square to zero . )",
    "note that in such a truncation we could give such a configuration a weight different from @xmath92 and still preserve the supersymmetry .",
    "this points to the existence of an infinite - dimensional space of possible supersymmetric truncations .",
