    "however it is far weaker when it comes to the formation and evolution of the star - forming components of galaxies . in this review ,",
    "i will concentrate on disk galaxies , and discuss the problems that have arisen with some of the proposed solutions .",
    "much of our understanding centres on the concept of self - regulation of the global star formation rate .",
    "unfortunately , some of the key ingredients are poorly known .",
    "the dark matter that dominates the matter budget of the universe , and in particular the galactic mass budget , is considered to be non - dissipative . while the precise nature of the dark matter remains elusive",
    ", the hierarchical formation of non - dissipative dark potential wells in which baryons dissipate and condense into stars , has provided a successful model for many elements of the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "galaxy clustering can be explained in such a framework , as can the properties of the dark halos that are inferred , for example , from rotation curves , and of the intergalactic medium where neutral baryons in the form of the lyman alpha forest provide a powerful probe of the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "tidal torques are generated by nonlinear interactions between neighbouring fluctuations and nascent halos .",
    "if the baryons conserve angular momentum as they dissipate kinetic energy and contract , disks spanning the observed size distribution are formed .",
    "the distribution of angular momentum is not such a good match , as the theory predicts far more low angular momentum gas than is seen .",
    "once the baryon disk is self - gravitating , it is gravitationally unstable and fragments into stars .",
    "this general overview of disk formation can match many of the observed properties of disks provided that disk star formation is an inefficient process .",
    "observed disks are still gas - rich and star formation extends over 50 or more disk dynamical time - scales .",
    "disk star formation can be understood via a hybrid model that is a combination of phenomenology and gravitational instability theory .",
    "the low efficiency of star formation is determined by the gravitational instability of a cold gas - rich disk , resulting in the formation of warm molecular gas clouds which in turn fragment into stars . cloud collapse and star formation",
    "are enhanced by cloud coalescence and growth , as the clouds orbit the galaxy .",
    "this process is modulated and amplified by the spiral density wave pattern of the differentially rotating disk .",
    "the instability in a gas disk is quenched by the toomre criterion , when the toomre parameter , @xmath5 , becomes larger than unity . here",
    "the critical surface density is , to within a numerical factor of order unity , given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 equal to the epicyclic frequency and @xmath8 being the gas velocity dispersion . for a disk consisting of stars and gas ,",
    "the criterion must be slightly modified , but it is essentially the coldest component , the gas , that drives the instability , provided that the gas surface density @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the disk stellar surface density and @xmath11 is the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "this scheme is used to derive an empirical star formation rate , the schmidt - kennicutt law , which has been applied to fit a large sample of star - forming disk galaxies . beyond the radius where the azimuthally - averaged surface density drops below the critical value , the disk is stable to cloud formation . the inferred star formation rate , if one assumes that the clouds once formed are unstable to star formation within a disk rotation time or less , can be approximated by @xmath12 for @xmath13 with @xmath14 the instability requires the disk to be in differential rotation , at rate @xmath15 .",
    "the predictions of such a semi - empirical model are straightforward : star formation occurs inside - out in disks , quenching below the threshold surface density of cold gas ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) of a few solar masses per square parsec , and star formation decays monotonically as the gas supply is exhausted .",
    "the duration of star formation can be extended if gas infall occurs from the halo .",
    "broadly viewed , such a model works reasonably well from the point of view of chemical evolution ( cf .",
    "prantzos , these proceedings ) .",
    "however detailed recent studies of disk star formation suggest that there are significant omissions in the underlying physics .",
    "for example , there is the realization that the radial dependence of disk star formation is not always well modeled by the empirical law @xcite . in some galaxies",
    ", star formation occurs below the threshold surface density .",
    "this is most likely due to the non - axially symmetric distribution of the gas .",
    "locally the gas surface density may be high , as for example in spiral arms .",
    "another hint of the need for a more complex theory comes from studies of the age distribution of disk stars . in the milky way",
    ", the star formation rate history is seen to be non - monotonic @xcite .",
    "in fact , studies of chromospheric age indicators reveal a series of modest star bursts . a similar pattern is found in other nearby galaxies where stars can be resolved , and the hertzsprung - russell diagram can be used to study the star formation history .",
    "presumably , infall is occurring in a non - uniform way , for example via mergers of satellite galaxies",
    ". studies of the metallicity distribution of old disk stars in the solar neighbourhood require early infall in order to account for the paucity of old metal - poor stars .",
    "the underlying logic of dissipative disk formation in weakly interacting halos of cold dark matter seems compelling .",
    "star formation is inefficient in disks because of self - regulation .",
    "the disk forms via collapse in the dark halo of gas that has acquired some angular momentum via tidal torques between neighbouring halos . the dimensionless angular momentum parameter is initially @xmath18 and contraction by a factor of order 10 in an isothermal dark halo of virial radius 100 kpc that dominates the gravity results in a disk of scale around 5 kpc if specific angular momentum is approximately conserved .",
    "the gas disk is cold and gravitationally unstable , forming giant cloud complexes that aggregate gas and are in turn unstable to fragmentation .",
    "feedback both via dynamical heating of the stars and by supernova remnant interactions heat and stabilize the system against further star formation , until further gas infall drives further gas cooling .    because of the bottom - up nature of the clustering hierarchy , driven by the approximately scale - invariant primordial density fluctuation spectrum , the density fluctuation amplitude scales with mass as @xmath19 with @xmath20 on galaxy scales .",
    "this means that massive halos form after lower mass halos , with the virialization redshift scaling as approximately @xmath21 .",
    "there is as much mass in the low mass halos as in the massive halos , with the number of halos scaling as @xmath22 .",
    "there are serious deficiencies in the model that remain when disk formation is incorporated by such simple rules into semi - analytic galaxy formation theory that builds on numerical simulations of dark matter clusters .",
    "several fundamental problems have arisen in detailed attempts to implement disk formation .",
    "the baryons undergo excessive cooling .",
    "the highest resolution simulations to date have revealed that as a consequence of the unresolved clumpiness of the dark matter , most of the baryonic angular momentum is lost to the dark halo by dynamical friction of infalling baryon clumps .",
    "the final specific angular momentum is only twenty percent or less of what is observed .",
    "the angular momentum distribution also does not match that of dark halos if the baryon angular momentum distribution tracks that of the dark matter , there being far too much low angular momentum gas at small galactocentric radii in the models .",
    "even if angular momentum is assumed to be conserved by the baryons , the final disk in a milky way - like galaxy is about twice as massive as observed .",
    "one issue is generic to hierarchical formation models with a specified efficiency of turning gas into stars .",
    "the most massive systems form late , and hence are expected to be younger and therefore bluer than less massive disks .",
    "the opposite trend is seen in the disk colour - magnitude relation @xcite .",
    "a further difficulty arises from the substructure in the dark halos that results in the formation of many satellite halos .",
    "these are not observed as stellar systems , for example in the distribution of local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "another problem concerns the density distribution of the dark matter halos .",
    "the dark matter halos seem to be too concentrated compared to actual galaxies .",
    "cusps are predicted in the halo cores that are not seen in nature , and the ratio of dark mass to baryonic mass is excessive in the vicinity of the baryon - dominated disk .",
    "several galaxies have been modelled in detail and illustrate these various trends .",
    "the milky way has the best studied rotation curve .",
    "binney and evans combined the inner rotation curve with microlensing data to infer that the observed microlensing optical depth towards the galactic centre requires so many stars that one has difficulty in acommodating a diffuse cold dark matter component .",
    "no more than 10 percent of the dark matter within 5 kpc can be diffuse and non - baryonic @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nfw profile ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 with @xmath25 ) is not allowed .",
    "indeed , the highest resolution simulations require an even steeper dark matter cusp ; @xmath26 .",
    "this certainly would not allow enough bulge and inner disk stars to give a reasonable microlensing optical depth .    a complementary study by klypin et al focuses on the outer milky way rotation curve .",
    "they argue that up to half of the mass within 10 kpc may be contributed by the dark halo , thereby allowing a nfw profile @xcite .",
    "however this conclusion comes at a cost . only 60 percent of the baryons inferred by the model to be within the virial radius can be accomodated in the bulge , stellar halo and disk , including interstellar matter .",
    "most of the observed mass of course is in stars , which are measured directly for stars of order a solar mass or larger , and via rotation curve modelling , diffuse infrared emission and bulge microlensing for the least massive stars .",
    "all disk formation and evolution simulations seem to run into a similar difficulty , as for example in a recent discussion of colour evolution @xcite .",
    "several of these issues are manifestations of the overcooling problem that is generic to hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "the cooled baryon fraction in cluster simulations is about 30 percent , whereas the global cdm prediction is about 5 percent for the baryon fraction , which for @xmath27 predicts 15 percent for rich clusters , as indeed is observed .",
    "about half of the cooled baryons remain on the peripheries of clusters as the warm / hot intergalactic medium at @xmath28 k. numerical sph simulations find such a wigm , although the physics of how this gas is heated yet remains outside the cluster virial radius is not completely clear .",
    "shock heating is obviously important , but there are numerical issues that need to be clarified .",
    "the wigm however only acccounts for about 30 percent of the total baryon content of the low redshift universe",
    ". the cluster x - ray luminosity - temperature correlation , which monitors the mass in virialised gas , does not satisfy the simple scaling expected in hierarchical collapse models , but rather suggests that preheating , preferentially in the lower mass clusters , may have helped to steepen the luminosity - temperature correlation from @xmath29 to @xmath29 .",
    "another probe of dark matter in reasonably luminous disks comes from studying the kinematics of barred galaxies .",
    "debattista and sellwood argued that a maximal disk is required , eg for ngc 3198 , in order to maintain a self - gravitating bar @xcite . on the other hand , kranz et al .",
    "find varying results for the disk mass fraction by modelling the detailed kinematic structure , for example the ( unbarred ) galaxy ngc 4254 requires a submaximal disk @xcite .",
    "the colour - magnitude relation ( b - k versus k ) reveals another difficulty @xcite .",
    "the more luminous galaxies , the redder they are , indicative of less vigorous recent star formation .",
    "semi - analytical disk models , even when feedback is included , give the inverse correlation .",
    "this is another manifestation of the overcooling problem .",
    "the oldest early - type galaxies are found to be the most massive , and these have the highest @xmath30 $ ] , indicative of the shortest star formation time - scales .",
    "the opposite trend is expected in hierarchical models @xcite .",
    "the baryon fraction in stars may be understood if approximately half the baryons that initially cooled within the virial radius have been expelled .",
    "supernova feedback seems incapable of driving such a wind in the early gas - rich phase of galaxy formation because of the significance of cooling .",
    "however there are indications that vigorous winds are seen in the lyman break galaxies , as inferred from the inverse p cygni line profiles in template spectra and from the lyman alpha forest suppression found within a mpc or so of the lyman break galaxies . in nearby galaxies where so - called superwinds are found ,",
    "the observed mass outflow rate is comparable to the star formation rate , e.g. in ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that strong winds can be driven from typical galaxies , yet numerical simulations find that winds are stalled for the more massive halos .    what physics has hitherto been omitted from the simulations ?",
    "the simulations are gravity - driven .",
    "star formation may be , in extreme situations , pressure - driven .",
    "this could result in strong positive feedback via for example shock - triggered massive star formation and generate enhanced rates of correlated supernovae .",
    "that would in turn drive a transient wind .",
    "starbursts are known to drive winds .",
    "one mechanism appeals to bar formation .",
    "a merger creates a transient bar .",
    "the spin - down and dissolution of this bar torques and accelerates the gas which responds by an enhanced rate of dissipation and angular momentum loss , for example via cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "bars are known to drive luminous starbursts , and minor mergers may drive ultraluminous starbursts , the ultimate sources of superwinds .",
    "the gas - rich environment provides a plausible site for supermassive black hole formation .",
    "this phenomenon appears to occur contemporaneously with spheroid formation , as inferred from the remarkable correlation between central black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion .",
    "smbh - driven outflows , manifest as a smbh - energized component of the overall luminosity , may be important in early phases of galaxy formation .",
    "at least one explanation of the observed correlation appeals to outflows as the self - regulatory mechanism .",
    "while the formation of structure in halos building up from clouds of weakly interacting dark matter is reasonably well understood , the formation of the luminous components of galaxies is founded on simplistic assumptions . a more realistic treatment of star formation in forming galaxies",
    "must ultimately modify many of the predictions that are failing to adequately confront the observations .",
    "feedback from supernovae is one solution that is being widely discussed .",
    "supernova remnants deposit substantial energy into the interstellar medium , and are responsible for the observed multiphase structure of the interstellar gas . some nearby low mass star - forming galaxies show a porous structure in the interstellar gas , where many overlapping shells and bubbles are seen that demonstrate that supernova input is playing an important role in pressurizing the interstellar gas . some display an anti - correlation between x - ray and @xmath3 emission , indicative of supernova - driven bubbles .",
    "the microphysics of the interface between the supernova - heated gas and the cold interstellar medium is inadequately resolved by the simulations . plausibly , there are surprises in store .",
    "feedback reduces the efficiency of star formation .",
    "this is important for understanding the longevity of disk star formation .",
    "however attempts to use feedback in the phase of disk formation have had mixed success .",
    "a basic problem is that feedback delays star formation : if this works too well , all stars are young , in contrast to what is found in the outer parts of nearby disks such as m31 . numerical simulations that incorporate feedback find that disks are still too small , although possibly by only a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "if efficiency of star formation is to account for the observed colour - magnitude relation , then one needs a systematic reduction in efficiency of star formation with decreasing galaxy mass .",
    "some evidence for this is found in the correlations between stellar surface brightness and total stellar mass in the sdss study of 80,000 early and late - type galaxies @xcite . in ellipticals ,",
    "such an effect would help to simultaneously account for the trend of increasing @xmath30 $ ] with galaxy mass , if the most massive galaxies are the oldest and formed stars most rapidly .",
    "however no detailed implementation has been made of the relevant physics , in large part because one needs to incorporate a multiphase interstellar medium .",
    "the brute force computational approach will not resolve the outstanding problems in disk galaxy formation .",
    "what seems to be needed are further analytical insights that will allow refinement of the simple prescriptions for star formation .",
    "one such approach has come from studying turbulence - driven viscous evolution of differentially rotating disks .",
    "recent investigations of star formation suggest that turbulence plays an important role in accounting for the longevity of star - forming clouds and their fragmentation into stars .",
    "the jeans mass in a typical interstellar cloud greatly exceeds the stellar mass range .",
    "it is likely that the gravitational instability of galaxy disks is a primary source of interstellar cloud turbulent motions , supplemented on small scales by supernova feedback . of course",
    ", these drivers of turbulence are coupled together , since the rates of star formation and star deaths are controlled by global gravitational instability . in effect , differential rotation is the ultimate source of the turbulence .",
    "a promising hypothesis is that turbulent viscosity , by regulating the gas flow , controls the star formation rate , and indeed that the star formation time - scale is given by the time - scale for the viscous transfer of angular momentum @xcite . on the scale of molecular clouds ,",
    "such an ansatz is reasonable , since one has to shed angular momentum in order to form stars .",
    "magnetic fields are the common culprit in conventional star - forming clouds , but in protogalactic disks one most likely has to appeal to another source of angular momentum transfer .",
    "turbulent viscosity is capable of fulfilling this role .",
    "indeed , the resulting disk has been shown to generically develop an exponential density profile @xcite . in infall models",
    ", the initial angular momentum profile determines the final disk scale length if angular momentum is conserved .",
    "however as found in high resolution simulations , some 90 percent of the baryonic specific angular momentum is lost to the dark halo , and there is no preferred solution for disk sizes . in viscous disk models ,",
    "the scale length is set by the competition between viscosity - driven star formation , that freezes the scale length once stars form , and dynamical friction on the dark matter , that competes for the same angular momentum supply .",
    "the characteristic viscous scale is determined by the cloud mean free path between collisions , itself comparable to the disk instability scale that drives the turbulence , and in combination with the residual rotation rate , provides the ultimate constraint on disk scales .",
    "another byproduct of the viscous disk model is the gas fraction @xcite . the viscous redistribution time - scale , and hence the star formation time - scale , is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cloud mean free path ( of order the disk scale height ) , and @xmath8 is the cloud velocity dispersion .",
    "disk instability yields @xmath33 the star formation efficiency , if determined by supernova feedback and approximate conservation of momentum , is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the specific supernova momentum per unit mass injected into the interstellar medium . here",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass in stars per supernova and @xmath38 is the velocity of transition of a remnant to approximate momentum conservation .",
    "the characteristic star formation time may then defined to be @xmath39 where @xmath15 is the disk rotation rate at radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the instantaneous stellar mass and @xmath42 is the gas mass .",
    "a steady state is reached in which the gas fraction is @xmath43 and the disk scale length is @xmath44 thus the disc scale depends both on cosmology and on local conditions .",
    "the inferred present epoch numbers are plausible : for @xmath45 one finds @xmath46 and @xmath47 also , one has now @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50kpc . at disk formation , one expects that @xmath51 , @xmath52 yr , and @xmath53 kpc , appropriate to the protodisk .",
    "these values result in a stellar disk scale - length @xmath54 kpc .",
    "it is encouraging that simple analytic estimates come out with reasonable numbers for gas and stellar disk scales and gas fraction .",
    "whether such a simple model survives incorporation into 3-dimensional simulations of disk formation in the presence of a live dark matter halo and energetic winds remains of course to be seen .",
    "spheroids are an integral component of practically all disk galaxies . studies of spheroid formation are complicated by the fact that there is no global theory of star formation even at the semi - empirical level that works moderately well for cold gas disks .",
    "small spheroids most likely form by secular evolution of bar - unstable disks .",
    "however it is not possible to form massive spheroids by secular evolution .",
    "galaxy mergers are undoubtedly the major trigger for formation both of massive spheroids in early - type disk galaxies and of elliptical galaxies .",
    "it has been realized from the earliest simulations of mergers that gas - rich precursors are required in order to attain the high central densities of massive spheroids .",
    "the gas dissipates , forms stars that in turn self - enrich more gas , ending up with the metal - rich nuclei characteristic of massive ellipticals .",
    "this must have happened with high efficiency , since spheroidal stellar populations are characteristically old .",
    "the necessarily high star formation rate constitutes a star burst , defined simply by the requirement that the mean star formation rate is inferred to have been much higher , perhaps by two orders of magnitude , than the mass of stars divided by a hubble time .",
    "nearby starbursts are well studied .",
    "typically , starbursts are rare in the nearby universe but increasingly common at high redshift . star formation rates of up to 1000 m@xmath55 yr@xmath56 are inferred .",
    "the most extreme star formation rates are invariably associated with evidence for an ongoing merger .",
    "most of the star formation generated by gas concentration triggered in a merger is shrouded by dust , and most of the radiation is absorbed and reemitted in the far infrared .",
    "simulations demonstrate that the mergers of gas - rich galaxies efficiently drive the gas into the central kiloparsec of the merged galaxy by a powerful combination of tidal torquing on the gas due to the merged transient stellar bar that results from the merger , which removes angular momentum and compresses the gas , followed by strong dissipation of energy by radiative cooling of the gas .",
    "ultraluminous infrared starbursts are likely to be the sites of ongoing spheroid formation .",
    "this conjecture is supported by near - infrared observations of post - starburst galaxies , where the characteristic de vaucouleurs profiles found in spheroids can be recognized in the newly formed stars .",
    "there is an intriguing complication .",
    "spheroids have been found to be intimately linked with supermassive black holes .",
    "the tight correlation observed between black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion covers the range of black hole masses @xmath57 to @xmath58 m@xmath55 . and encompasses stellar spheroids as small as that of the milky way ( @xmath59 m@xmath55 ) to those as massive as m87 ( @xmath60 m@xmath55 ) .",
    "the clear implication is that the formation of spheroids and supermassive black holes was contemporaneous .",
    "if the spheroid formed by a merger , the strong central gas enhancement provides an ideal environment for supermassive black hole formation .",
    "the enormous amount of binding energy released as the smbh formed would impact the protogalactic gaseous environment , as would the ensuing effects of energy released by infall into the newly formed black hole .",
    "outflows would be a natural outcome , and these could help stimulate further star formation .",
    "observationally , it is unclear what role quasar - like activity plays in the energetics of the far - infrared and submillimeter galaxies that are undergoing luminous starbursts . in the nearby case of arp 220",
    ", it is apparent that star formation and buried quasars play comparable roles in accounting for the observed luminosity .",
    "there seem to be two distinct modes of global star formation .",
    "an inefficient , quiescent mode that is self - regulated by feedback occurs in galactic disks . a violent",
    ", efficient starburst mode is triggered and fueled by merger - induced tidal torques , and accounts for the formation of the massive stellar spheroids .",
    "the disk mode of star formation most likely also accounts for the low mass spheroids , which are generated dynamically via secular evolution of disks .",
    "semi - analytic galaxy formation modelling has not yet incorporated the full richness of star formation phenomenology .",
    "there are five critical issues currently confronting semi - analytic theory , and improvements in star formation modelling and the dynamical coupling of baryonic and non - baryonic matter will be necessary to address most of them .",
    "* perhaps the most innocuous of the problems is the overproduction of substructure , and in particular the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is likely to be resolved at least in part by early photo - ionization at redshifts above 6 , before the reionization of the intergalactic medium was complete .",
    "early photo - ionization of dwarfs with velocity dispersion less than about 30 km / s suffices to eject most of the gas before the bulk of the star formation has occurred . because this happens early",
    ", there is a proximity effect : only the most widely separated dwarfs , which experience a lower uv flux , retain their gas and survive as stellar systems .",
    "one can both account for the paucity of observed dwarfs and their mean separations from the parent galaxies .",
    "what is not yet clear is whether the number of smc - like systems predicted is consistant with observations , nor more seriously perhaps , is whether reconciling the low dwarf abundance in the local group allows one to also understand the apparent surfeit of dwarfs observed in some nearby galaxy clusters . *",
    "the baryon overcooling problem is more serious .",
    "the factor of about 2 excess predicted for disk baryons can be resolved either by ejection or by hiding the gas .",
    "winds can occur if outflows from massive galaxies are stronger than predicted by simple disk modelling and simulations .",
    "the lyman break galaxies possibly indicate the effectiveness of early winds , but it is likely that these galaxies end up as e or s0 galaxies , as inferred from their spatial clustering .",
    "substantial amounts of gas could be hidden in the form of dense cold clumps of @xmath17 , or even in diffuse @xmath17 in the outer disk , where @xmath17 may be more readily hidden .",
    "* disk scale lengths can possibly be explained via turbulent feedback .",
    "winds may play a role here too , if the predominantly low angular momentum gas , which ends up in the central core , is preferentially expelled .",
    "a supermassive black hole - driven outflow may provide a possible driver for the nuclear wind .",
    "* disk colours , and indeed spheroid colours , present another difficulty , as exemplified by the colour - magnitude relation .",
    "disks , whose global colours are characteristic of intermediate age populations , have stellar populations that are systematically too red , and too old , at large masses . for ellipticals ,",
    "the problem is somewhat different .",
    "the colour - magnitude relation is driven primarily by metallicity , with there being little evidence for any significant age spread in cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "the stellar populations are predominantly old .",
    "both massive and low mass ellipticals have similar ages .",
    "either the low mass systems formed stars earlier but less efficiently , hence reducing their effective age , or gas accretion occurred to produce a similar effect .",
    "the alpha element ratio enhancement for the cores of massive ellipticals supports an early and efficient duration of star formation for these systems .",
    "field ellipticals and s0s however show a substantial age spread . *",
    "the issue of a cusp in the dark matter profile represents a contentious issue around which the observations have not yet converged .",
    "it may be that dynamical effects , such as black hole mergers , provide the best means of scouring out the cusp .",
    "the related matter of dark matter concentration seems to vary between galaxies , and there are hints that it varies between barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "this suggests again that a complex dynamical history may be partly to blame .",
    "i am indebted to my group at oxford for many discussions of galaxy formation , and in particular for conversations pertinent to this review with julien devriendt , ignacio ferreras , adrianne slyz and james taylor .",
