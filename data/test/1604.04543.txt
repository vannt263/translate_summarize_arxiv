    "radio observations of ultracool dwarfs ( ucds ; @xcite ) address important issues in the physics of low - mass stars , brown dwarfs , and planets .",
    "the most commonly discussed problem is the generation and topology of the magnetic fields in fully - convective , low - mass stars and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "because these objects are cool , rapid rotators , the usual magnetic activity indicators provided by h@xmath1 and x - ray emission become inefficient , and the zeeman splitting based technique does not work , due to the rotational broadening of spectral lines employed in this method @xcite . on the other hand , radio detections , especially of the electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) driven",
    ", rapid bursts of emission , enable a direct measurement of the lower bound to the local magnetic field strength ( @xcite , and references therein ) , provide means to measure stellar rotation @xcite , and diagnose the conditions of the magnetosphere - ionosphere interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition , modeling of the time - frequency ( dynamic ) spectra of these bursts provides information on the ucd magnetic field topology @xcite .",
    "another problem that can be addressed using radio detection as a tool is the angular momentum evolution of ucds @xcite .",
    "rotation period measurements of young brown dwarfs in clusters demonstrate that these objects lose very little of their initial angular momentum as they evolve @xcite .",
    "measurements of the periodic radio bursts generated by the coolest , old dwarfs probe the late stages of their rotational evolution .",
    "the advantage of using ecm - generated radio flaring for period measurements over optical / near - infrared photometry is that their precision is not dependent on cloud - induced intensity variations .",
    "for example , the apparent radio flaring period of a rapidly - rotating , m9-type ucd , tvlm 513 - 46546 , shows only a @xmath00.03% variation around the average value of 7054.468 s calculated over a 7-year baseline @xcite . in contrast , the measurability and precision of photometrically - derived periods critically depend on the ratio of the period itself to the timescale of cloud evolution @xcite .",
    "the late l , t , and y - type dwarfs detectable in the radio can also be treated as proxies for studies of the magnetic properties of young , massive exoplanets , assuming , for example , the magnetic field scaling predictions discussed by @xcite .",
    "although attempts to detect low - frequency radio emission from hot jupiters generated by the stellar wind - planetary magnetosphere interaction have not been successful ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) , ghz - frequency measurements of hot exoplanets discovered by direct imaging at optical wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) may offer a practical alternative in the form of detections of ecm radio bursts similar to those generated by the coolest ucds @xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we have been searching for polarized radio flaring from these objects with the arecibo radio telescope .",
    "our first survey of 33 ucds at 5 ghz has resulted in the first discovery of a radio emitting t - dwarf , the t6.5 ucd , 2mass j10475385 + 212423 ( j1047 + 21 ; route & wolszczan 2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "follow - up jansky very large array ( jvla ) observations detected quiescent radio emission from this object @xcite , confirmed its flaring component @xcite , and produced a measurement of the 1.77-hr rotation period of the star @xcite .",
    "in addition , guided by the fact that j1047 + 21 is also a weak h@xmath1 emitter , @xcite have detected quiescent and flaring radio emission from four out of five h@xmath1 and optical / infrared variability - selected l and t - type ucds .    here , we report the arecibo detection of another t - dwarf , wisepc j112254.73 + 255021.5 ( j1122 + 25 ) , in the course of the second part of our unbiased survey of late l and t - type ucds .",
    "the most distinguishing characteristic of this new radio - emitting ucd is its tentatively established ultra - fast rotation period .",
    "if confirmed , it will become by far the shortest one measured for any ucd .",
    "our observations , the detection of flares from j1122 + 25 , their characteristics , and a tentative measurement of the ucd s rotation period are described in section 2 .",
    "further discussion of these results and our conclusions are given in section 3 .",
    "the entire arecibo ucd survey will be described in a forthcoming paper .",
    "wisepc j112254.73 + 255021.5 was discovered in the course of the wide - field infrared survey explorer survey ( wise ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "medium resolution near - infrared spectroscopy using the spex on nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) led to the classification of the object as a t6 brown dwarf , with a spectrophotometric distance estimate of 16.9 pc .",
    "nearby m5 field star lhs 302 has similar distance and proper motion to that of j1122 + 25 , but due to its low mass and a wide projected separation of @xmath04500 au , the objects are unlikely to be physically bound .",
    "the continuing l and t- spectral type dwarf survey with the arecibo radio telescope uses the instrumental setup and data analysis method discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "j1122 + 25 has been detected on 2013 may 8 as a broadband , left - hand circularly polarized ( lcp ) , @xmath01.5 mjy flare .",
    "four additional lcp flares have been identified in the data taken on 2013 december 27 and 31 , and 2014 january 4 , during a weeklong confirmation run .",
    "the 2013 december 27 event , shown in fig .",
    "1 as the most prominent example of the j1122 + 25 flaring , consists of two 100% lcp bursts , occurring @xmath01100 s apart , with peak fluxes of @xmath03 mjy and @xmath02.5 mjy , respectively , at the full , 0.1 s resolution .",
    "an additional 10 hours of observations made in 2015 may and june , non - simultaneously covering the 3 - 4 ghz and 4 - 5 ghz bands , have not produced any additional detections .",
    "a search of the `` 14dec17 '' release of the first radio catalog  found no radio sources within the half - power beam width of the telescope , with a detection limit of 0.92 mjy .",
    "the nearest sources are the star j112253.4 + 255250.2 at a separation of 148.8 arcsec , and j112247.6 + 254736.9 , an unknown object 184.3 arcsec away with peak fluxes of 1.19 mjy and 4.08 mjy , respectively , at 1.4 ghz .",
    "these sources are located well outside of the arecibo @xmath01 arcmin beam at 5 ghz .",
    "j1122 + 25 is only the second radio emitting t - dwarf identified in an unbiased survey , after our detection of flaring from j1047 + 21 @xcite .",
    "j1122 + 25 emits broadband , short duration , 30 - 120 s pulses , characterized by a rapid , variable frequency drift ( 50 - 800 mhz s@xmath2 ) and left circular polarization ranging from 15% to 100 % .",
    "these characteristics are typical of ecm emission generated by electrons moving in the magnetic fields of rapidly rotating ucds @xcite . similar to j1047 + 21 ,",
    "the emission is clearly sporadic with only five pulse detections in 29 hours of observations .",
    "however , as observed by @xcite , j1047 + 21 does undergo periods of activity , during which several varying , consecutive pulses can be detected .",
    "the shortest measurable timescale of intensity fluctuations in the flares can be used to estimate an upper limit to the source size and a lower limit to its brightness temperature .",
    "we have computed a noise - corrected autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the strongest , december 27 flare sampled at the original , 0.1 s resolution , and integrated over the interference free parts of the total bandpass , @xmath3=1 ghz ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the acf shows a clear change of slope around the @xmath02 s lag , indicating the presence of intensity fluctuations in the flare on a similar timescale .",
    "as the flare rapidly drifts in frequency at @xmath450800 mhz s@xmath2 , this timescale most likely represents intensity variations that are faster than our 0.1 s resolution , but they are smeared by frequency drifting to @xmath51.252 s. this places an upper limit of @xmath00.4 r@xmath6 on the size of the emitting region , and leads to the source s brightness temperature estimate , t@xmath7 k.    the high degree of circular polarization of the j1122 + 25 flares and the above t@xmath8 , which is close to the t@xmath9 k compton limit of compact radio sources @xcite , make it entirely feasible to assume that the ecm mechanism is responsible for their generation . in this case , the star s local magnetic field strength , @xmath10 , can be estimated from the corresponding cyclotron frequency , @xmath11 b ( gauss ) , where @xmath12 hz , represents the upper end of the 1 ghz receiver bandpass .",
    "because the observed emission appears to extend beyond that frequency for all five flares , the cutoff frequency of emission has yet to be measured , and the computed @xmath13 kg must be treated as a lower limit to the actual magnetic field strength of the star .      we have investigated the possibility that , despite their sporadic character , the flares may be periodic .",
    "if all five flares appear in phase with the dwarf s rotation period , it is obviously constrained by the @xmath01100 s separation of the two december 27 events ( fig .",
    "1 ) . to refine this period estimate and test whether the five flares are indeed phase - connected , we have used a monte carlo ( mc ) approach in which trial periods have been randomly drawn from a 15 to 20 min .",
    "interval , and fitted to flare times - of - arrival ( toas ) with the tempo  modeling code in a manner described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the modeling process is complicated by the high variability of the flare profiles , thus making it impossible to unambiguously determine the phase reference points for toa measurements . therefore , in our procedure , we have included a random selection of toas from windows which were centered on the flares and spanned the full widths of flare profiles at the 10% flux density level .",
    "tempo was used to fit 2000 trial periods to each of the 500 sets of randomly - selected , five flare toas .",
    "surprisingly , we have easily obtained a phase - connected timing solution with a new , improved period of 1035.7881@xmath140.0008 s and a post - fit rms residual , @xmath150.86 s. phase alignment of the five flares at the best - fit period is shown in fig .",
    "the same period is obtained with the flare toas fixed at the approximate centers of the profiles , but the post - fit @xmath16 becomes @xmath010 s , which reflects the toa uncertainty due to the changing flare morphology ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as the result of period modeling based on only five data points must be treated with caution , we have checked its statistical significance with a mc simulation in which we have randomly drawn 5@xmath1710@xmath18 sets of five time - tags of samples from the five , 10-minute , 667-data point observing windows containing flares ( figs 1,3 ) , and used tempo to fit the measured best - fit period to these simulated arrival times . by counting the post - fit @xmath1910 s values from these fits ,",
    "we have computed a 0.01% false alarm probability ( fap ) for our period measurement of the j1122 + 25 flares . for a much more restrictive , @xmath191 s criterion",
    ", the fap becomes vanishingly small .",
    "another possibility is that the two , apparently consecutive , december 27 flares were generated by different activity regions in the magnetosphere , and only one of them was rotational phase - connected to the remaining three events .",
    "such behavior has been observed in other well - studied , periodically radio emitting ucds , such as tvlm 513 and 2mass j07464256 + 2000321 ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we have therefore conducted mc tests in the manner described above by removing either of these two flares from the data set .",
    "the best - fit period for the four flares with the first december 27 one removed is 1032.6988@xmath140.0008 s with @xmath16=0.16 s. not surprisingly , this is very close to the 1035 s period calculated for the five flare case .",
    "the data are also very well fitted with the approximately third subharmonic of that period , 3107.519@xmath140.002 s and @xmath16=0.82 s. when the second flare is excluded , the best - fit period is 2053.1398@xmath140.0005 , @xmath16=0.22 s , expectably close to twice the shortest period , which necessarily produces the same fit .",
    "the fap values for the two fits , using the @xmath1910 s criterion , are 0.2% and 0.02% , respectively . as discussed above",
    ", it is important to remember that the tiny , formal tempo errors associated with the best - fit periods are much smaller than the actual , more realistic uncertainties of @xmath2015 s resulting from the flare profile variability and the associated ambiguity in determining the actual toas .",
    "these uncertainties have been estimated from the scatter of the best - fit periods with @xmath1910 s around the one with the lowest @xmath16 value .",
    "finally , we have folded all the available data not containing the five flares , modulo the best - fit periods , to check for the possible presence of low - level , periodic emission .",
    "this analysis has not produced any obvious detection , down to the 3@xmath16 level of @xmath030 @xmath21jy .",
    "we conclude that both the available observational evidence and the fap estimates suggest that one of the three , obviously harmonically - related periodicities in the j1122 + 25 flaring over the period of 8 months is very likely to be real , but additional , extensive , possibly multi - wavelength observations are needed to verify this result .",
    "our detection of radio flaring from the t - dwarf j1122 + 25 , reported in this paper , significantly adds to the small group of five late - l and t - dwarfs previously known to display this type of activity @xcite .",
    "the j1122 + 25 flares are lcp with brightness temperatures approaching 10@xmath22 k , indicating their ecm origin . in this case",
    ", the local magnetic field strength must exceed 1.8 kg , in agreement with similar measurements of other radio detected ucds @xcite .    clearly , the most interesting aspect of our radio detection of j1122 + 25 is the tantalizing possibility that the flares from this ucd occur at a period that may be as short as @xmath017 minutes .",
    "the shortest rotation periods derived from the photometric variability of ucds at optical / near - infrared wavelengths are 1.41 and 1.55 hours , for the t6.5 dwarf 2mass j22282889 - 4310262 @xcite and the t7 dwarf 2mass j00501994 - 3322402 @xcite , respectively .",
    "an even shorter , but never confirmed periodicity of 16.5 min has been reported for the t4.5 dwarf 2 m 0559 - 1404 @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have observed a varying , 30 - 46.4 min periodicity in the young , m8.5 dwarf s ori 45 , but , obviously , even if real , it could not be interpreted in terms of stellar rotation , because of its variability .    in principle",
    ", the rotational breakup period of an old brown dwarf , @xmath23 , could be as short as @xmath020 min , using the standard value of r , which is the jupiter radius , r@xmath6=7@xmath1710@xmath24 m , and the mass , m@xmath2580 m@xmath6 .",
    "assuming @xmath26 s , the shortest of the three possible periods of the j1122 + 25 flares , one needs r@xmath250.9 r@xmath6 to ensure that @xmath27 .",
    "taking into account a significant oblateness of the star induced by rapid rotation , and using the darwin - radau relationship @xcite , the oblateness of a rotating star is given in terms of its polar and equatorial radii , r@xmath28 and r@xmath29 , as : @xmath30}^{-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the angular rotational velocity of the star , k = i/(mr@xmath32 ) ranges from 0.261 to 0.205 for the polytropic indices n=1 and n=1.5 , respectively , and i is the moment of inertia . assuming the observed value of @xmath31=6.1@xmath1710@xmath33 s@xmath2 , n=1.5 for high surface gravity , the corresponding breakup oblateness , @xmath34 @xcite , and r=0.8 r@xmath6 , we get log(g)@xmath05.5 . this , together with constraints provided by the dwarf s temperature of @xmath35 k @xcite , and the evolutionary models of @xcite , gives m@xmath3660 m@xmath6 and a lower limit of @xmath01 gyr to the age of the star .    of course , the two longer periods produce correspondingly less extreme characteristics of the dwarf .",
    "for example , for p@xmath37=2053 s and r = r@xmath6 , the darwin - radau approximation gives log(g)@xmath365 , which leads to m@xmath3635 m@xmath6 for t@xmath29=1000 k. if any of the three measured periods is real , all these estimates make j1122 + 25 an ultra - rapidly rotating , massive ucd with the radius falling well within the theoretical range for dwarfs older than 1 gyr .    despite the plausibility of the existence of",
    "sufficiently evolved dwarfs rotating at periods @xmath251 hour , based on the investigations of the angular momentum loss in the evolving substellar objects ( see @xcite , for a review ) , none have been detected so far . whereas objects rotating close to their breakup periods may be rare , this situation could also be caused by observational biases . however ,",
    "several ground and space - based surveys of l and t dwarfs conducted in the past had sufficiently high sensitivity and cadence of photometric measurements to be able to detect such periodicities ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , photometric fluctuations of the ucds generated by cloud dynamics can dramatically blur their rotation - induced variability , even for the shortest periods observed so far @xcite . the same could happen for objects with rotational periods @xmath251 hour , if the `` weather '' related variations on such the short timescales are still feasible .    ideally , assuming any of the three possible periods discussed above , and a quasi - steady emission source , flares from j1122",
    "+ 25 should be detectable at least once during each , typically @xmath02-hour long observing session .",
    "flaring from this dwarf is clearly sporadic , but , as in the case of the first radio detected t - dwarf , j1047 + 21 @xcite , it could occasionally undergo periods of higher activity @xcite .",
    "the sporadic appearance of flares from j1122 + 25 and a few other radio - emitting t - dwarfs detected so far is most likely related to variations in the flow of electrons into the magnetic field needed to power the observed , ecm - generated flaring . given the star s largely neutral , field - decoupled atmosphere , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have argued that , like in the cases of jupiter and saturn , the power needed to create such currents in the magnetosphere is extracted from rotation . in particular , @xcite propose that such currents could be created through magnetic field reconnection at the boundary between the closed and the open field lines , where the magnetosphere opens up to the interstellar medium . as the conditions in this transition region are expected to be highly variable , it would naturally explain the intermittent character of the observed emission .    of course , more work is needed to confirm the j1122 + 25 flaring period reported in this paper .",
    "this includes a study of its photometric variability and , if possible , a measurement of the @xmath38 value , which , if the rotation period reported here is real , is likely to be much above 100 km s@xmath2 . more attempts to detect radio flaring from the dwarf are also important . finally , it would be of interest to verify if j1122 + 25 is a detectable h@xmath1 emitter and/or it exhibits any enhanced variability at optical / infrared wavelengths .",
    "if so , it would further strengthen the evidence presented by @xcite that the best candidates for detectable radio emission among the coolest ucds are the ones that exhibit one or both of these properties .",
