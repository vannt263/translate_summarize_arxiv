    "the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , first proposed by @xcite , is a commonly used device for numerical approximation of integrals of the type @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a probability density function .",
    "intuitively , the method is based on producing a sample @xmath2 of random variables from the distribution @xmath1 defines .",
    "the integral @xmath3 is approximated with the average @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the random variables @xmath2 are a realization of a markov chain , constructed so that the chain has @xmath1 as the unique invariant distribution .",
    "one of the most commonly applied constructions of such a chain in @xmath5 is to let @xmath6 with some fixed point @xmath7 , and recursively for @xmath8 :    1 .",
    "simulate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an independent random variable distributed according to some symmetric proposal distribution @xmath11 , for example , a  zero - mean gaussian , and 2 .   with probability @xmath12 ,",
    "the proposal is accepted and @xmath13 ; otherwise the proposal is rejected and @xmath14 .",
    "this symmetric random - walk metropolis algorithm is often efficient enough , even in a relatively complex and high - dimensional situation , provided that the proposal distribution @xmath11 is selected properly . finding a good proposal for a particular problem can , however , be a difficult task .",
    "recently , there has been a number of publications describing different adaptation techniques aiming to find a good proposal automatically @xcite ( see also the review article @xcite ) .",
    "it has been a common practice to perform trial runs , and determine the proposal from the outcome .",
    "the recently proposed methods are different in that they adapt on - the - fly , continuously during the estimation run . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the forerunner of these methods , the adaptive metropolis ( am ) algorithm @xcite , which is a random - walk metropolis sampler with a gaussian proposal @xmath15 having a covariance @xmath16 .",
    "the proposal covariance @xmath16 is updated continuously during the run , according to the history of the chain . in general , such an adaptation may , if carelessly implemented , destroy the correct ergodicity properties , that is , that @xmath17 does not converge to @xmath3 as @xmath18 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for practical considerations of the am algorithm",
    ", the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "in the original paper @xcite presenting the am algorithm , the first ergodicity result for such adaptive algorithms was obtained .",
    "more precisely , a strong law of large numbers was proved for bounded functionals , when the algorithm is run on a compact subset of @xmath5 .",
    "after that , several authors have obtained more general conditions under which an adaptive mcmc process preserves the correct ergodicity properties .",
    "andrieu and robert @xcite established the connection between adaptive mcmc and stochastic approximation , and proposed a general framework for adaptation .",
    "atchad and rosenthal @xcite developed further the technique of @xcite .",
    "andrieu and moulines @xcite made important progress by generalizing the poisson equation and martingale approximation techniques to the adaptive setting .",
    "they proved the ergodicity and a central limit theorem for a class of adaptive mcmc schemes .",
    "roberts and rosenthal @xcite use an interesting approach based on coupling to show a weak law of large numbers .",
    "however , in the case of am , all the techniques essentially assume that the adapted parameter is constrained to a predefined compact set , or do not present concrete verifiable conditions .",
    "the only result to overcome this assumption is the one by andrieu and moulines @xcite .",
    "their result , however , requires a modification of the algorithm , including additional re - projections back to some fixed compact set .",
    "this paper describes sufficient conditions under which the am algorithm preserves the correct ergodicity properties , and @xmath19 almost surely as @xmath18 for any function @xmath20 that is bounded on compact sets and grows at most exponentially as @xmath21 .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ thm : am - ergodicity ] ) holds for the original am process ( without re - projections ) having a target distribution supported on  @xmath5 .",
    "essentially , the target density @xmath1 must have asymptotically lighter tails than @xmath22 for some @xmath23 , and for large enough @xmath24 , the sets @xmath25 must have uniformly regular contours .",
    "our assumptions are very close to the well - known conditions proposed by jarner and hansen @xcite to ensure the geometric convergence of a ( nonadaptive ) metropolis process . by the techniques of this paper ,",
    "one may also establish a central limit theorem ( see theorem [ thm : am - clt ] ) .",
    "the ergodicity results for the am process rely on three main contributions .",
    "first , in section [ sec : notations ] , we describe an adaptive mcmc framework , in which the adaptation parameter is constrained at each time to a feasible adaptation set . in section",
    "[ sec : main - andrieu ] , we prove a strong law of large numbers for such a process , through a modification of the technique of andrieu and moulines @xcite .",
    "second , we propose an independent estimate for the growth rate of a process satisfying a general drift condition in section [ sec : grow - bound ] .",
    "third , in section [ sec : am - ergodicity ] , we provide an estimate for constants of geometric drift for a symmetric random - walk metropolis process , when the target distribution has super - exponentially decaying tails with regular contours .",
    "the paper is essentially self - contained , and assumes little background knowledge .",
    "only the basic martingale theory is needed to follow the argument , with the exception of theorem [ th : m - t - computable ] by meyn and tweedie @xcite , restated in appendix [ sec : proof - lemma - drift - to - conv ] . even though we consider only the am algorithm , our techniques apply also to many other adaptive mcmc schemes of similar type .",
    "we consider an adaptive markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) chain evolving in space @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the state space of the `` mcmc '' chain @xmath28 and the adaptation parameter @xmath29 evolves in @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a separable normed vector space .",
    "we assume an underlying probability space @xmath32 , and denote the expectation with respect to @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "the natural filtration of the chain is denoted with @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "we also assume that we are given an increasing sequence @xmath37 of subsets of the adaptation parameter space @xmath38 .",
    "the random variables @xmath39 form a stochastic chain , starting from @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and for @xmath42 , satisfying the following recursion : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a transition probability for each @xmath45 , @xmath46 is an adaptation function , and @xmath47 is a decreasing sequence of adaptation step sizes @xmath48 .",
    "the functions @xmath49 are defined as @xmath50 thus , @xmath51 ensures that @xmath52 lies in @xmath53 for each @xmath42 .",
    "the recursion ( [ eq : adapt - eq ] ) can also be considered as constrained robbins  monro stochastic approximation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let @xmath54 be a function .",
    "we define a @xmath55-norm of a function @xmath20 as @xmath56 as usual , we denote the integration of a function @xmath20 with respect to a ( signed ) measure @xmath57 as @xmath58 , and define @xmath59 for a transition probability @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath55-norm of a signed measure is defined as @xmath61 the indicator function of a set @xmath62 is denoted as @xmath63 and equals one if @xmath64 and zero otherwise .",
    "in addition , we use the notation @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we define the following regularity property for a family of functions @xmath67 .    [ def : poly - lip ]",
    "suppose @xmath54 . given an increasing sequence of subsets @xmath68 , @xmath8",
    ", we say that a family of functions @xmath67 , with @xmath69 , is @xmath70-polynomially lipschitz with constants @xmath71 , if for all @xmath72 , we have @xmath73",
    "this section contains general ergodicity results for a sequentially constrained process defined in section [ sec : notations ] .",
    "these results can be seen auxiliary to our results on adaptive metropolis in section [ sec : am - ergodicity ] , but may be applied to other adaptive mcmc methods as well .",
    "suppose that the adaptation algorithm has the form given in ( [ eq : state - eq ] ) and ( [ eq : adapt - eq ] ) , and the following assumptions are satisfied for some @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    1 .   for each @xmath45",

    ". then @xmath99    the proof of theorem [ thm : slln - restricted ] is postponed to the end of this section .",
    "we start by the following lemma , whose proof is given in appendix [ sec : proof - lemma - drift - to - conv ] .",
    "it shows that if we have polynomially worse bounds for drift and minorization constants , then the speed of geometric convergence can get only polynomially worse .",
