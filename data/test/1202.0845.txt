    "a wealth of @xmath0 data , for single- and double - polarization observables , is anticipated from electromagnetic facilities worldwide over the coming months and years .",
    "these data will be pivotal in determining the underlying amplitudes in complete experiments , and in discerning between various microscopic models of multichannel reaction theory .",
    "the focus of precision electromagnetic measurements , over the nucleon resonance region , is to more fully map the non - perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics , the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , to shed light on its confining and chiral symmetry breaking properties .",
    "these electromagnetic data take the field to the next and necessary level of precision .",
    "this is required in order to obtain a theoretical description of the nucleon that both explains and subsumes the simple constituent quark model , which has provided a qualitative picture of nucleon structure and reactions .",
    "the expected data heralds an era of precision hadron spectroscopy , particularly for baryons , and has ushered in a renaissance in hadronic reaction theory .",
    "significant refinements in the quality and quantity of available data offer the opportunity to develop more sophisticated models of hadronic reactions , constrained by fundamental principles of field theory , such as unitarity and gauge invariance , which have model dependencies under better control , if not eliminated .",
    "such a complete and successful phenomenology would appear to be a prerequisite for a deeper understanding in terms of quarks and gluons  @xcite .    the present manuscript details multipole analyses of the single - pion photoproduction data using a parametrization form related to , but an improvement upon , previous said parametrizations  @xcite .",
    "the energy - dependent ( ed ) analysis is performed over the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath1 ) range from the near - threshold region to about 2.5  gev , including resonances through the fourth resonance region .",
    "we also generate single energy solutions ( ses ) , which fit the data over narrow energy bins assuming phase information obtained from the ed solutions .",
    "the relations between ed and ses fits have been extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . a detailed discussion of amplitude and observable conventions is also given in this source .",
    "the fitted pion - photoproduction database is identical to that used in our most recent  @xcite sn11 analysis , based on the standard said parametrization . in the following section",
    ", we compare the previous and present said fit forms used to analyze these data .",

    "the chew - mandelstam ( cm ) energy - dependent ( ed ) parametrization for the hadronic @xmath2 matrix , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been used in a recent coupled - channel fit of @xmath3 elastic scattering and @xmath4 reaction data .",
    "it gives a realistic description of the data with @xmath5 per datum better than any other parametrization or model , to our knowledge  @xcite .",
    "the parametrization form used in this fit is given as @xmath6^{-1}_{\\alpha\\sigma }      { \\ensuremath{\\overline{k}}}_{\\sigma\\beta } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are indices for the considered channels , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "this parametrization has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . given the success of this approach in the hadronic two - body sector ,",
    "its application to the study of meson photoproduction is warranted .",
    "the main result of the present study is the use of the information encoded in eq .   by employing the factor @xmath12^{-1}$ ] ( called the `` hadronic rescattering matrix '' ) in the photoproduction parametrization form .",
    "the cm form of eq .   may be extended to include the electromagnetic channel as : @xmath13^{-1}_{\\alpha\\sigma }      { \\ensuremath{\\overline{k}}}_{\\sigma\\gamma } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 denotes the electromagnetic channel , @xmath15 , and @xmath9 denotes the hadronic channels which appear in the parametrization of the hadronic rescattering matrix , @xmath16^{-1}$ ] .",
    "note that by sharing the common factor , @xmath16^{-1}$ ] which encodes , at least qualitatively speaking , the hadronic channel coupling ( or rescattering ) effects , eqs .   and",
    "constitute a unified approach to the problem of parametrizing the hadronic scattering and photoproduction amplitudes .",
    "we pause here to make several remarks about the analytic form of the parametrization and its use in the present study .",
    "we first note that since the cm  k - matrix @xmath17 is a polynomial in the center - of - mass energy , @xmath1 , an entire function , non - analytic points in the complex-@xmath1 plane are all a result of the hadronic rescattering matrix , @xmath16^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this matrix has branch points and poles consistent with two - body and quasi - two - body unitarity  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - two - body channels , @xmath18  and @xmath19  model the three - body @xmath20   channel only approximately .",
    "we use eqs .   and as follows .",
    "the parameters of the hadronic cm  k - matrix , @xmath21 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 may include ( depending on the partial wave ) @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are fixed by fitting the @xmath22 and @xmath23  data as in ref .",
    "the @xmath24-photoproduction data is then fitted  @xcite by varying only the parameters of the electromagnetic cm  k - matrix elements , @xmath25 , where @xmath9 includes the channels @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "this approach differs markedly from that adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite . there , the fit form , motivated by a multichannel heitler k - matrix approach  @xcite",
    ", @xmath26 was modified to include a term @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the elastic @xmath29 scattering partial - wave amplitude associated with the pion - photoproduction multipole amplitude @xmath30 .",
    "the added piece , which grows with the @xmath29 reaction cross section , was found to improve the fit at energies above the @xmath31 threshold .",
    "each of the phenomenological terms @xmath32 to @xmath33 was parameterized as a polynomial in energy , having the correct threshold behavior .    in the new form , terms @xmath32 and @xmath34",
    "have been effectively replaced by a single cm  k - matrix element , @xmath35 .",
    "conversely , the influence of channels opening above @xmath29 is now ( more correctly ) associated with individual channels ( @xmath31 , @xmath18 , and @xmath36 ) rather than a single term .",
    "large cancellations found to occur between the born , @xmath32 , and @xmath34 terms suggested that a more economical parametrization is possible  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cm  k - matrix form provides a better overall fit to the data with fewer free parameters , as we will show in the next section .",
    "in table  [ tab : tbl1 ] , the fit quality and number of searched parameters is compared for the two fit forms discussed in the previous section . here",
    "we have used the same database to 2.7  gev as was used in generating solution sn11  @xcite .",
    "the present cm12 form requires fewer parameters to achieve a slightly better data fit .",
    "the energy - dependence of this result was tested by repeating the analyses over three different energy ranges .    as the fit employs polynomial functions for @xmath32 to @xmath33 , of sn11 , or the electromagnetic cm  k - matrix elements of cm12",
    ", a subjective criteria is required to determine the order of polynomials fitted . in the fits to 2.7  gev",
    ", the order of polynomial functions was increased until further additions improved the overall @xmath5 by 50 or less .",
    "this same criteria was used in both the sn11 and cm12 fits , in order to have a basis for comparison . as more parameters were searched , their ability to improve the fit diminished . in the fits to lower energy limits",
    ", parameters were removed in steps , again with the condition that removing a parameter should not increase the overall @xmath5 by more than 50 .    in figures  [ fig : f1]@xmath37[fig : f6 ] , we compare sn11 and cm12 to maid07  @xcite and bonn - gatchina  @xcite fits .",
    "only proton - target multipoles are presented , as changes in the neutron - target database are likely to alter these fits in the near future . for resonances with a canonical breit - wigner shape , such as the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , all solutions agree fairly well in the neighborhood of the resonance energy .",
    "the fit cm12 deviates significantly from sn11 in the @xmath42 multipole .",
    "the cm12 phase behavior , from threshold up to the peak of the @xmath43 resonance , differs from sn11 and maid07 , but is qualitatively similar to the bonn - gatchina result , as shown in figure  [ fig : f7 ] . while both sn11 and maid07 essentially follow the @xmath44 pion - nucleon phase up to the @xmath31 threshold cusp , the cm12 and bonn - gatchina fits depart from this phase above the two - pion production threshold .",
    "some structures occuring in sn11 , between threshold and the first resonance energies , are missing or diminished in cm12 .",
    "examples are the real parts of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . in each of these cases ,",
    "the cm12 fit more closely resembles the maid07 and bonn - gatchina results .",
    "this reflects the fact that the replacement of the phenomenological terms @xmath32 and @xmath34 of eq .",
