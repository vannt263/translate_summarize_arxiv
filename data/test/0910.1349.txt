    "in recent years unexpectedly strong radio emission has been detected from very low mass stars and brown dwarfs ( hereafter , ultracool dwarfs ) , revealing that these objects are capable of generating and dissipating kg - strength magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the radio luminosity remains nearly uniform from early - m to mid - l dwarfs , even though other magnetic activity indicators ( h@xmath12 and x - rays ) decline by about two orders of magnitude over the same spectral type range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , radio observations provide a particularly powerful probe of the magnetic field properties .",
    "the radio emission from several ultracool dwarfs also exhibits a periodicity that matches the stellar rotation velocity ( @xmath13 ) , thereby pointing to a large - scale , axisymmetric , and stable magnetic field configuration on timescales of hours to years @xcite .",
    "these conclusions are also supported by observations of zeeman broadening in feh molecular lines @xcite and time - resolved optical spectropolarimetry @xcite .",
    "since ultracool dwarfs are fully convective , the solar - type @xmath14 dynamo , which operates at the shearing interface between the radiative and convective zones @xcite , can not be responsible for generating and amplifying the inferred fields .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations suggest that large scale axisymmetric fields can still be generated in fully convective objects , at least for conditions that roughly correspond to mid - m dwarfs ( @xmath15 m@xmath16 ; @xcite ) .",
    "simulations that correspond to the conditions in ultracool dwarfs are challenging and have not been investigated so far . as a result",
    ", observational constraints on the scale , geometry , and origin of the fields are essential .",
    "the spectroscopic zeeman techniques are currently of limited utility for the dim and generally rapidly - rotating ultracool dwarfs , since they require very high signal - to - noise ratios and have reduced sensitivity at high rotation velocities due to line broadening @xcite .",
    "detailed radio observations are thus crucial .    here",
    "we present the first very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of ultracool dwarfs , aimed at providing further constraints on their magnetic field properties .",
    "in particular , these observations have sufficient angular resolution to detect astrometric shifts of a few tenths of a milliarcsecond that may be exerted by a sub - stellar companion with a period of a few hours .",
    "they also allow us to directly image a radio - emitting companion down to milliarcsecond scales .",
    "the presence of such putative companions may enhance the magnetic activity through direct or tidal interaction .",
    "we detect the well - studied m8.5 dwarf tvlm513 - 46546 with the vlba , the first such detection for any ultracool dwarf .",
    "the detectability of this object with the vlba suggests that long - term astrometric monitoring could reveal the presence of a planetary - mass companion on a @xmath7 d orbit .",
    "such a detection would also usher in a new era of extrasolar planet studies through radio astrometry .",
    "the m8.5 dwarf tvlm51346546 ( hereafter tvlm51346 ) is located at a distance of 10.6 pc @xcite .",
    "it was first detected at radio wavelengths by @xcite who found persistent emission and a circularly polarized flare lasting about 15 min at 8.5 ghz .",
    "subsequently , @xcite detected quiescent radio emission at 4.9 and 8.5 ghz , but did not detect any flares .",
    "@xcite found rotational modulation in the radio emission with a periodicity of @xmath9 hr , and subsequently , @xcite detected periodic bursts of circularly polarized radio emission with a period of 1.96 hr .",
    "most recently , @xcite confirmed the presence of polarized flares combined with quiescent emission in simultaneous multi - wavelength observations ( radio , x - ray , and h@xmath12 ) .",
    "these authors also found weak x - ray emission and periodic h@xmath12 emission .",
    "thus , the current picture of the radio emission from tvlm51346 is one involving different activity states ; quiescent radio emission appears to always be present ( @xmath17 @xmath18jy at 8.5 ghz ) , but variability and periodic bursts have not been detected in all observations .",
    "we also observed 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 ( hereafter , 2m0036 + 18 ) , an l3.5 dwarf located at a distance of 8.8 pc @xcite . this object has also been previously detected at radio wavelengths :",
    "@xcite found strongly variable and periodic radio emission with a periodicity of 3 hr , which was later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the average 8.5 ghz flux density measured previously was about 135 @xmath18jy @xcite .",
    "tvlm51346 and 2m0036 + 18 were observed simultaneously with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , the very large array ( vla ) , and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) on 2008 march 30 .",
    "four hours of on - source time in the vlbi observations were obtained at 05:4512:32 ut for tvlm51346 and 13:4020:35 ut for 2m0036 + 18 ; the vla observations covered the entire time range .",
    "all data were analyzed with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "vla observations were obtained at a frequency of 8.5 ghz with 26 antennas in the c configuration .",
    "we used the standard continuum setup with @xmath19 mhz bands and full polarization .",
    "flux calibration was obtained using j1331 + 305 , while j1455 + 2131 ( for tvlm51346 ) and j0019 + 2021 ( for 2m0036 + 18 ) were used as complex gain calibrator sources .",
    "the bootstrapped flux densities for these two sources were 0.081 jy and 0.866 jy , respectively .",
    "about once every 50 min additional scans of secondary calibrators were obtained , resulting in corresponding gaps in the target source light curves .",
    "the vlbi observations included the 10-antenna vlba , the gbt , and the vla as a phased array .",
    "phase - referenced observations were carried out with a data rate of 256 mbit s@xmath20 in dual polarization , using 2-bit sampling .",
    "eight base - band channels of 8 mhz bandwidth each covered an aggregate bandwidth of 32 mhz .",
    "the correlator dump time was 2 s. the complex gain calibrators j1455 + 2131 and j0019 + 2021 were located at distances of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .    unfortunately , the phase calibrators were not sufficiently bright to phase up the vla between scans on the target sources , and the phased vla data had to be removed from the vlbi experiment . similarly , the gbt experienced bad weather , and the telescope had to be stowed for nearly 2.5 hr due to freezing rain during the second half of the experiment . as a result of the poor phases we also removed the gbt from the vlbi experiment . finally , of the ten vlba antennas , we removed hancock ( hn ) , which experienced heavy snow fall and hence elevated system temperatures .",
    "we therefore separately analyze the vla and vlba data sets .",
    "the vla data allow us to determine the flux densities of our target sources , to construct light curves , and to constrain the search areas for counterparts on vlbi scales .",
    "both sources are detected in the vla observations .",
    "tvlm51346 has a flux density of @xmath23 @xmath18jy , and is located at a position of ra= ( @xmath24 s ) , dec= ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the synthesized beam size is @xmath26 .",
    "no circular polarization is detected in the integrated data , with a @xmath4 limit of @xmath27 .",
    "the light curve reveals that the emission is composed of a quiescent component and short - duration flares lasting for only a few minutes but with circular polarization approaching @xmath28 ( figure  [ dwf1501_lc2 ] ) .",
    "the most prominent flares are detected at 08:25 and 09:22 ut . during the first two hours ,",
    "when no flares are detected , the flux density is @xmath29 @xmath18jy .    in light of previous results indicating that tvlm51346 exhibits periodic radio variability , we conducted a periodicity search using the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite ; figure  [ scarglefig ] .",
    "we find a signal at a period of 58.8 min , exactly half of the previously reported period .",
    "surprisingly , no obvious signal is detected at the harmonic of 117.6 min , even though three cycles at that periodicity fit into the observation .",
    "the 58.8-min period is the only peak in the periodogram above the critical level of about 16 that corresponds to a false alarm probability of 0.01 .",
    "note that the false alarm probability does not take into account the flux density errors of the light curve .",
    "we also detect 2m0036 + 18 with a flux density of @xmath30 @xmath18jy , similar to previous detections (  [ sec : targets ] ) .",
    "no significant variability was detected in the light curve .",
    "tvlm51346 is detected with the vlba , the first such detection of any ultracool dwarf . to locate the source in a data set using the inner seven vlba antennas we shifted the phase center of the @xmath31 data to the nominal vla position and created a map covering @xmath32 , encompassing the vla position uncertainty ( @xmath33 mas ) .",
    "we find a single robust source at the @xmath34 significance level , which persists with changes in the imaging parameters and source detection routines ( aips sad and jmfit ) .",
    "the source is located 46 mas ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) from the nominal vla position",
    ". we therefore identify this source as the vlba counterpart of tvlm51346 and shift the phase center to this position for subsequent analysis .",
    "the source is located at a position of ra= ( @xmath36 s ) , dec= ( @xmath37 ) , where the errors are statistical only ( figure  [ dwf1501_vlbi_1 ] ) .    with a synthesized beam size of @xmath38 mas ( @xmath39 )",
    "the source appears to be unresolved ; it has a peak brightness of @xmath40 @xmath18jy beam@xmath20 and an integrated flux density of @xmath41 @xmath18mjy ( the vla and vlba fluxes overlap at the @xmath42 level ) . at the distance of tvlm51346",
    ", the beam size corresponds to a spatial resolution of about 0.026 au , or about 50 times larger than the expected radius of tvlm51346 .    to follow up on this detection with an increased angular resolution",
    ", we added the outer vlba antennas located on mauna kea and st .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam size is @xmath43 mas ( @xmath44 ) . at this resolution ,",
    "the s / n ratio decreases , and the peak brightness of tvlm51346 is @xmath45 @xmath18jy beam@xmath20 , and its integrated flux density of @xmath46 @xmath18jy has a larger error bar since the source no longer appears to be well - described by a single unresolved gaussian component .",
    "instead , it appears asymmetric and resolved ( figure  [ dwf1501_vlbi_2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates a marginally resolved source on the longest baselines , but the significance is too low to warrant a firm conclusion .",
    "the synthesized beam corresponds to a source size of about 20 stellar radii , larger than expected for the magnetic field scale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that if tvlm51346 is indeed resolved , then this likely indicates a binary system with two radio - emitting sources and a projected separation of about 1 mas . in this case , since radio emission has only been detected to date from objects with spectral type earlier than l3.5 @xcite , the binary would likely be close to equal mass .",
    "we note that 2m0036 + 18 was not detected in the vlba data due to insufficient sensitivity .",
    "since tvlm51346 is unresolved on a scale of about 2.5 mas , we can place a firm lower limit on the brightness temperature of its quiescent emission of @xmath47k .",
    "this is not sufficiently high to _ directly _ rule out thermal emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to constrain the brightness temperature to values above @xmath48 k , indicative of non - thermal emission",
    ", the angular resolution will have to be @xmath49 mas .",
    "we note that other considerations ( expected size of the magnetic field , radio spectral index ) point to non - thermal emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sub - milliarcsecond astrometry of tvlm51346 that is available thanks to its detectability with the vlba underscores the potential for a vlbi astrometric companion search .",
    "since tvlm51346 is already at the stellar / sub - stellar transition , such a companion would be a sub - stellar object ( brown dwarf or planet ) .",
    "@xcite have recently used such vlba astrometry to search for companions to nearby early - m dwarfs .",
    "they detected five m dwarfs with spectral types m1-m5 in one to three epochs with the vlba down to a @xmath50 sensitivity limit of about 0.5 mjy .",
    "their astrometric residuals compared to optical measurements of the parallax and proper motion were about 0.2 mas , similar to the astrometric accuracy we achieved here for tvlm51346 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of our detection only allows us to search for an astrometric shift during the 7-hour observation when separately imaging the first and second halves of the data set . using data from the inner 7 vlba antennas we find a positional difference of @xmath51 mas , consistent with no significant shift .",
    "we note that the expected maximum astrometric shift ( equal - mass companion ) for an orbit of a few hours is about @xmath52 mas , indicating that vlba observations alone ( with @xmath53 mas ) can not detect the presence of such a companion at the brightness level of tvlm 51364 .",
    "however , more sensitive combined vlba+gbt observations may provide the required signal - to - noise ratio to probe the presence of an equal - mass companion in a few - hour orbit ( corresponding to a separation of @xmath54 stellar radii ) .",
    "moreover , if tvlm51346 is indeed a roughly equal mass binary with a projected separation of about 1 mas ( @xmath55 d orbit ) we expect an easily detectable astrometric signature of @xmath2 mas on a 1 d timescale .    equally important",
    ", a planetary - mass companion to tvlm51346 can be detected on longer timescales , since a wider orbit leads to a larger astrometric signal . in figure  [ exoplanetfig ]",
    "we plot the maximum reflex motion induced by a companion orbiting tvlm51346 with a range of masses ( @xmath56 m@xmath6 ) and orbital periods ( @xmath57 d to 1 yr ) .",
    "we find that at @xmath58 mas for vlba observations similar to the one presented here , we can detect a 10 m@xmath6 companion with an orbital period of @xmath7 d ( @xmath8 au ) , or a 2 m@xmath6 companion with an orbital period of @xmath10 yr ( @xmath59 au ) . using the combined vlba+gbt , with an expected astrometric uncertainty of @xmath60 mas ( due to a higher signal - to - noise ratio and a higher fraction of longer baselines ) , we will be able to detect a 1 m@xmath6 planetary companion in a @xmath61 yr orbit .",
    "we note that these limits are appropriate for the case where tvlm51346 is a single star .",
    "if the object is an equal mass binary , as may be indicated by the results of direct imaging , the search for planetary - mass companions will be more challenging .",
    "using high angular resolution radio vlbi observations , we clearly detect the ultracool dwarf tvlm51346 on an unprecedented small scale of about 2.5 mas or about 50 stellar radii .",
    "the source is unresolved on this scale , but it may be marginally resolved on a @xmath2 mas scale when using the longest vlba baselines , although the s / n ratio is low .",
    "given the corresponding physical scale of about 20 stellar radii , this may point to a binary system with two radio - emitting sources in a @xmath55 d orbit .    beyond the possibility of a spatially resolved binary , a search for an astrometric shift in the position of the source due to the gravitational influence of a close companion yields a @xmath4 limit of @xmath62 mas , about 3 times larger than the expected shift for an equal - mass companion in a few - hour orbit .",
    "since we lost the phased - vla and gbt data , we expect that future vlbi observations will provide the requisite astrometric accuracy to search for an equal - mass companion in such a tight orbit .",
    "these future observations will also allow us to determine whether the marginally - resolved emission from tvlm51346 is indeed due to an equal mass companion with a projected separation of about 20 stellar radii .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the expected maximum reflex motion is about 1 mas , easily detectable with vlba+gbt observations that span several days .    equally important",
    ", the fact that tvlm51346 is detected with the vlba opens the possibility to astrometrically search for a planetary - mass companion with a @xmath63 d orbit .",
    "monitoring of tvlm51346 with the vlba or vlba+gbt on timescales of days to months to years will allow us to probe the existence of companions with masses of @xmath64 m@xmath6 and with orbits of @xmath65 d to @xmath2 yr .",
    "these observations may lead to the first detection of an extrasolar planet via radio astrometry .",
    "thus , the use of vlbi observations opens up a wide companion parameter space for tvlm51346 , with detection via direct imaging for a roughly equal - mass radio - emitting companion down to a scale of @xmath3 stellar radii , and detection via reflex motion on scales as small as a few stellar radii for an equal mass companion , and scales of @xmath66 au for a planetary mass companion .",
    "this first vlba detection also paves the way for similar observations of known and future radio - emitting ultracool dwarfs in search of companions ."
