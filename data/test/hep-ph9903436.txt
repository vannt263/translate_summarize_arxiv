    "the phenomenological interest of prompt - photon production in fixed - target experiments  @xcite resides mainly in its use as a gluon probe in structure - function studies .",
    "prompt - photon production is historically our main source of information on the gluon parton density at large  @xmath4 ( e.g. @xmath5 )  @xcite , a region which has very little influence on the evolution of the deep - inelastic - scattering structure functions .",
    "this same region is relevant for hadron colliders in production phenomena at very large transverse momenta , and thus its understanding is crucial in order to disentangle possible new physics signals from the qcd background .    for example , a particularly interesting problem has emerged in the past few years in the production of large - transverse - energy ( ) jets at the tevatron .",
    "an excess over the qcd prediction has been reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite , for jets with @xmath6  gev . while the excess has not been confirmed by the d@xmath7 data  @xcite ,",
    "it is of interest to study the uncertainty in the high-  tail of the jet distribution due to the gluon density systematics , to see whether there is room for deviations as large as those detected by cdf .",
    "for example , a suitable modification of the gluon density at large @xmath4 has been proposed ( cteq4hj  @xcite ) , which is consistent with the excess observed by cdf .",
    "the study of the recent e706 prompt - photon data  @xcite , however , suggests that a consistent fit of the large-@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) rate is incompatible with the cteq4hj gluon density  @xcite .",
    "moreover , both jet cross sections and direct - photon cross sections at high transverse energy are affected by soft - gluon effects .",
    "these effects should be understood in both cases in order to be able to claim a discrepancy with qcd predictions .",
    "in particular , these effects can be very important in the direct - photon case , since the typical  values probed are much smaller than in the case of jet production at the tevatron and , therefore , the size of the running coupling @xmath10 at the relevant scales is bigger .",
    "comparisons between theory and prompt - photon experimental results have been carried out recently in refs .",
    "the recent e706 data  @xcite seem to differ most from the next - to - leading order calculation , over the whole @xmath8 range . in refs .",
    "@xcite , an attempt is made to fit the e706 data by introducing an intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons with @xmath11 .",
    "the precise details of how the intrinsic @xmath12 is incorporated in the calculations , however , can significantly affect the impact of these corrections , as shown by the large variations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the use of an intrinsic - transverse - momentum model is sometimes motivated as a way of estimating the effects of soft - gluon emission .",
    "the most prominent effect of soft - gluon emission in drell - yan pair production is the generation of the characteristic transverse - momentum spectrum of the lepton pair .",
    "this can be modeled with an appropriate intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons . as a matter of fact",
    ", the formalism for soft - gluon resummation in drell - yan pair production can be shown to merge , at very small transverse momenta , into some non - perturbative intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons inside the hadron  @xcite .",
    "while this approach is not unreasonable when one considers the transverse momentum of the produced _ pair _ , it can however lead to inconsistencies for the problem of _ single_-photon production .",
    "in fact , for example , it is quite clear that the photon @xmath8 spectrum at large @xmath8 explores the kinematic region of @xmath13 in the parton densities , which is certainly not the case for the transverse - momentum distribution of a drell - yan pair .",
    "thus , as of now , a method for the inclusion of non - perturbative effects in the resummed formulae for the high-@xmath8 limit of the inclusive photon cross section is not available .",
    "furthermore , in the opposite limit of small @xmath8 , it is the multiple emission of hard ( rather than soft ) gluons that leads to a sizeable perturbative broadening of the transverse momenta of the incoming partons  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the effect of soft - gluon resummation in prompt - photon production near the threshold limit , that is to say for @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical evaluation of these effects , at the next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy , has been carried out independently in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we shall review in the next section the necessary formalism , using the language of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will present its phenomenological applications , and we will thus discuss its numerical implementation as well as its impact on physical cross sections .    as is well known , prompt - photon production takes place both by hard - photon emission from initial- or final - state quarks ( direct component ) , and by collinear radiation from final - state partons .",
    "this last mechanism is not fully calculable in perturbation theory and , in fact , it depends upon the photon fragmentation function .",
    "because of the large suppression of the fragmentation function at large momentum fractions @xmath15 , it is usually believed that this contribution becomes irrelevant when @xmath16 increases .",
    "contrary to common wisdom , we shall instead show that the very - large-@xmath8 behaviour of the direct and of the fragmentation production processes is the same if the incoming hadrons do not contain valence antiquarks , as in the case of @xmath17 collisions . under these circumstances",
    ", resummation should therefore be performed for the fragmentation emission too .",
    "we will show , however , that in the cases of practical interest the corrections due to the fragmentation processes are small , and we shall limit our considerations to the hard - photon part .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ secnotat ]",
    "we review the formalism for the resummation of threshold effects , and the main formulas valid for the specific case of prompt - photon production .",
    "there we also recall the main issues related to the inversion of the resummed expressions from mellin space back to the physical @xmath4 space . in section  [ results ]",
    "we study numerically the impact of the resummation corrections .",
    "we explore the effects both at the parton and hadron level , considering kinematical configurations and distributions of phenomenological relevance for current experiments .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the study of the size of the resummation corrections , and of the residual dependence on the choice of renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "section  [ datacomp ] contains a comparison between our results and the data from some recent experiments .",
    "this does not want to be a comprehensive phenomenological study , but a preliminary analysis of the impact of our results on the comparison of theory and data .",
    "our conclusions , and the outlook for future progress , are given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "an appendix collects some details of the resummation formulas .",
    "we consider the inclusive production of a single prompt photon in hadron collisions : [ procgamma ] h_1(p_1 ) + h_2(p_2 ) ( p ) + x .",
    "the colliding hadrons @xmath18 and @xmath19 carry momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "we parametrize the momenta in terms of light - cone coordinates : p^= ( p^+ , p_t , p^- ) , p^ ( p^0 p^3 ) . in their centre - of - mass frame , using massless kinematics , the momenta of the colliding hadrons have the following light - cone coordinates [ mom ] p_1^= ( 1,0,0 ) , p_2^= ( 0,0,1 ) , where @xmath22 is the centre - of - mass energy squared . the photon momentum @xmath23 is thus parametrized as [ momp ] p^= ( e^y , e_t , e^-y ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the transverse energy and the rapidity , respectively .",

    "the large disagreement between data and theory already present at nlo  @xcite is still present , as no net increase is obtained from the resummation contributions .",
    "their only effect is to reduce the scale dependence .",
    "a similar picture emerges from the comparison of the theory with the @xmath210 ua6 data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ua6comp ] .",
    "the disagreement between data and theory at low  is however much less dramatic here than in the case of e706 .",
    "the extent to which these low-  discrepancies can be removed by the inclusion of non - perturbative effects such as an intrinsic @xmath12 remains to be understood , as the global consistency of the different data sets is not very compelling  @xcite .",
    "we presented in this paper a numerical study of the impact of resummation corrections , at the next - to - leading logarithmic level , on the transverse energy distribution of direct photons produced in hadronic collisions .",
    "we dealt with the resummation of the @xmath223 sudakov logarithms studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", this work is mostly of relevance for typical fixed - target photon production .",
    "the current prompt - photon data from the high - energy hadronic colliders cover in fact the region @xmath224 , where sudakov effects are negligible .",
    "we showed that the inclusion of higher - order sudakov corrections improves significantly the factorization and renormalization scale dependence , relative to what observed in the fixed - order nl calculations .",
    "even when the scales are varied independently , the uncertainty from scale variations is significantly reduced . as a result of the reduced scale dependence ,",
    "the overall size of the resummation contributions depends significantly on the chosen scale . in general , however , the resummed cross sections for different scale choices have values contained within the nlo uncertainty band for   values up to 0.5 , and exceed the upper side of the nlo band by large factors when  approaches 1 .",
    "still , our resummation corrections turn out to be much smaller , at least in the range of existing data , than the effects induced at large  by some implementations of intrinsic @xmath12 effects , as discussed in refs .  @xcite . in these papers",
    "the effect of intrinsic-@xmath12 corrections was evaluated to be as large as factors of 3 and more , for the whole  range .",
    "we believe that this is related to the absence in the intrinsic-@xmath12 models of the appropriate sudakov suppression due to the presence of the hadronic system recoiling against the photon ( represented at ll in our formalism by the negative terms in the exponents of eqs .",
    "( [ dlresqg  ] ) and  ( [ dlresqq  ] ) ) .",
    "in our work we did not include resummation corrections to the fragmentation processes .",
    "we proved that , in @xmath17 collisions , the large-@xmath60 behaviour of the corrections to the @xmath225 processes is formally similar to that of the corrections to the leading one , @xmath226 .",
    "these corrections are therefore not suppressed when @xmath60 increases towards larger values . whether they can be neglected or not , is therefore a pure matter of numerics .",
    "we showed that their contribution is not dominant in the  regions of experimental interest , and limited ourselves to including them at the fixed next - to - leading order .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ fragcomp ] , we have no reasons to believe that the resummation corrections are any larger for the fragmentation processes than for the @xmath101 channel . a more quantitative study of these statements , and a complete phenomenological assessment of the comparison between theory and the current sets of data in view of the results presented in this paper , will be the subject of future work .",
