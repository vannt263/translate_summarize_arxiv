    "its fast write and read , small cell size , non - volatility and excellent endurance , spin transfer torque - based random access memory ( stt - ram ) devices bear excellent potential of dominating the embedded and standalone memory world in the near future .",
    "however , in order to compete with existing embedded technology , an stt - ram bit cell should be able to meet the following requirements : ( i ) a tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) needs to exceed 150% for low - power read ; ( ii ) thermal stability ( @xmath2 ) must be greater than 60 to achieve high static reliability ; ( iii ) a scalable spin transfer torque switching current ( @xmath3 1.5 x @xmath4 a/@xmath5 ) ; ( iv ) a very low write error rate ( wer ) @xmath6 with a fast device write time @xmath7 10ns ; and ( v ) an overall low energy write ( @xmath71pj ) , which corresponds to a low switching voltage @xcite .",
    "achieving such a diverse set of targets will require meticulous design and material engineering .",
    "the free layer in the stt - ram mtj memory cell is responsible for data storage , and must have enough stability against stochastic thermal switching to retain data for at least 10 years@xcite .",
    "in other words , the thermal stability , @xmath2 , needs to be greater than 60 . while we desire the device to have high thermal stability , the critical current and the time needed to switch also increase proportionally .",
    "higher thermal stability also contributes to longer switching tails , as the magnetization tends to be nearer to the stagnation points ( @xmath8 ) in the potential landscape , without any external perturbation . near the stagnation point ,",
    "the torque proportional to @xmath9 is too small to initiate switching .",
    "therefore a thermally stable free layer would require a relatively high current to have very low error rate @xmath10 for switching within 5 - 10 ns , resulting in costlier write operations .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a model ( fig 1 ) that can be used to calculate the current and energy consumed during a write operation with an acceptable wer for a given pulse width , @xmath11 , in a perpendicular stt - ram cell .",
    "the calculation is done in three blocks : ( 1 ) given a write - error - rate and switching time , we use an expression for switching errors from @xcite to extract the @xmath12 ratio , where @xmath13 is the current applied and @xmath14 is the critical current .",
    "( 2 ) the critical switching current @xmath14 is calculated using the landau - lifschitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation to yield the applied current @xmath13 .",
    "this expression also includes additional effects due to voltage - dependent polarization responsible for observed switching asymmetries@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) using a modified version of simmons tunneling current equation , that s includes the crucial pre - factors responsible for tmr , we can then estimate the switching voltage and thence the switching energy cost .",
    "the last two steps are coupled and need to be solved self - consistently , as the switching voltage depends on critical current , which depends on polarization , which in turn depends back on voltage .",
    "the energy consumed during the write operation can then be estimated from the switching current , voltage and time as @xmath15 .",
    "coupling all three equations  the wer expression , the modified simmons tunneling equation and the modified critical current equation@xcite including the role of voltage - dependent polarization are non - standard in the literature .",
    "note that this paper focuses on perpendicular materials , for which the wer expression has been explicitly worked out and calibrated against stochastic llg solutions@xcite . in future papers",
    ", we will extend this study to in - plane materials as well as to double barrier stt - rams .",
    "section ii describes the worst case , based on solving the fokker - planck equation . in section iii , we present the simmons equation modified to include spin dependent tunneling .",
    "the modified equations are used to extract electronic parameters from published cofeb / mgo / cofeb mtj current - voltage graphs . using the parameters extracted from the fit in section iii",
    ", the worst case energy consumption is thereafter calculated for a given @xmath2 and error rate in section iv .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    given a desired write - error - rate ( wer ) and switching delay @xmath11 , we can calculate the amount of current overdrive required relative to the critical switching current @xcite .",
    "numerically this amounts to introducing a stochastic langevin thermal torque in llg and then taking a time average over many runs .",
    "the equivalent probabilistic approach is to solve the fokker - planck equation for the probability density of each configuration and then average over the distribution to extract various moments .",
    "the fokker - planck equation can be solved analytically for the simple case of a perpendicular material with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the corresponding probability of _ not switching _ within a given delay @xmath11 , defining the wer , is expressed as @xmath16\\nonumber\\\\ i & = & i / i_c\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the current required and @xmath14 is the critical switching current , @xmath17 is the gilbert damping parameter , @xmath18 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath19 is the thermal stability of the free layer .",
    "@xmath20 is the volume of the free layer and @xmath1 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "@xmath21 is the effective anisotropy field resulting from both crystalline anisotropy(@xmath22 ) and demagnetization field .",
    "@xmath23 is the energy barrier that separates the two magnetization directions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    solving the llg equation we get a critical current similar to the expression derived by j.z .",
    "sun@xcite , but modified to include the proper switching asymmetry through the effective voltage dependent polarization(described in the next section ) , @xmath26 from the given @xmath27 and @xmath11 , we can get the current overdrive @xmath28 . in conjunction with the critical current",
    "above , we can then extract the applied current @xmath13 . finally ,",
    "using the modified version of simmons equation described in the next section , we can then estimate the switching voltage .",
    "in a magnetic tunnel junction , there are two ferromagnetic ( fm ) electrodes with an insulator between them . ignoring atomistic effects such as symmetry filtering@xcite",
    ", the one - band alignment problem across the magnetic tunnel junction can be specified with six parameters : ( i ) @xmath29 is the barrier offset between the contact and the insulator , ( ii ) @xmath30 is fermi - energy relative to the conduction band minimum in each contact ( assumed to be comprised of the same material ) , ( iii ) @xmath31 is the band splitting between majority and minority spin electrons and related to the contact polarization , ( iv ) w is the width of the insulator , while ( v ) @xmath32 and ( vi ) @xmath33 are the effective electron masses in the contact and barrier respectively ( fig .",
    "3 ) . at thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "the fermi levels at the two fm electrodes are aligned .",
    "however for a positive bias @xmath34 applied to the free layer , the energy levels in the fixed fm are shifted up by @xmath35 and the ones in the free fm are lowered by @xmath35 , separating the fermi levels at the two electrodes by @xmath34 .",
    "the mismatch in the fermi levels cause current to flow in the system through oxide tunneling . in a free electron model for the electrodes ,",

    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the unit vector orientations for the magnetizations in the free and fixed layers respectively .",
    "when a positive bias is applied , polarized electrons flow from the fixed fm contact to the free layer , causing the magnetization of the free layer to switch from anti - parallel to parallel . for negative bias ,",
    "the electron flow removes magnetization from the right layer , causing it to rotate from p to ap .",
    "notice that the torque exerted at the right , free ferromagnetic layer depends on the effective _ voltage - dependent _ polarization of the incident electrons from the left , fixed layer@xcite .",
    "this voltage dependence is critical to understanding the observed p to ap vs ap to p asymmetry in sttrams .",
    "the effective polarization of the incident electrons at a given voltage is given by , @xmath48 the voltage dependency on electron momentums , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are not explicitly mentioned in eq . 3 and 4 for notational simplicity .",

    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    using the self - consistent analytical model illustrated in fig . 1 , we calculate the worst case energy consumption during a write operation at room temperature for @xmath2=60 and various delays ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "energy consumption during p to ap switching is greater than that consumed during ap to p switching .",
    "this is because the effective polarization of the torque at negative voltage is less than that at positive voltage@xcite .",
    "+    energy consumed is the product of current , voltage applied and delay ( @xmath15 ) . when the applied current is greater than the critical current , the switching is precessional and the switching delay of the free layer is inversely proportional to the current , @xmath51 ^ 2+e\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    . at lower delay , the energy decreases logarithmically with delay as @xmath52 ^ 2 $ ] is the dominant term . at higher delay",

    "there is thus an energy minimum , @xmath54 , corresponding to an optimal delay value , @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , keeping @xmath2 at 60 , if @xmath0 is increased from 3.34 koe to 5.34 koe , and @xmath1 adjusted accordingly from 1257.3 emu / cc to 786.5 emu / cc , the @xmath54 is shifted from 0.1252pj at 10.5ns to 0.0783pj at 6.6ns for ap to p switching . similarly for p to ap switching , the energy minimum shifts lower from 0.3829pj at 16.25ns to 0.2393pj at 10ns . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath54 can be reduced quite significantly by increasing the anisotropy field , @xmath0 and decreasing the saturation magnetization , @xmath1 accordingly , while maintaining thermal stability .",
    "the duration of the voltage pulse needed to achieve the switching with @xmath10 write error rate , @xmath55 , also decreases with higher anisotropy field ( fig .",

    "3 ) and ( 2 ) a corresponding model that approximately calculates the energy consumed during a write operation that ensures a certain error rate and delay time . the combination of the two models enables us to calculate the energy consumption without performing a full - fledged stochastic calculation and to evaluate ways to reduce the energy consumption during worst - case writing in stt - ram . at lower delay",
