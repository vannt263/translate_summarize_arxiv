    "the sensitivity which @xmath0-body integrations exhibit to small changes in initial conditions and to numerical errors has been an active area of research since miller s landmark study .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the exponential divergence of near - by orbits for systems with @xmath1 and found that the separation of nearby orbits increases rapidly when close binary interactions occur .",
    "he suggested that the divergence of near - by orbits is too rapid to be solely accounted by binary interactions and suggests that there must be a collective effect to account for the results .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the divergence rate was reduced if the potential was replaced with a softened potential and concluded that the divergence is mainly due to close binary interactions .",
    "the dramatic effects of numerical errors on @xmath0-body integrations was also demonstrated in an important paper by @xcite . after coordinating a study with 11 different integrations of the same 25-body problem for 2.5 crossing times , lecar found that quantities such as half mass radius and the moment of inertia can change by as much as 100 percent . in a study with @xmath2 , @xcite demonstrated that the amplification of initial errors can increase by as much as @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , they showed that the growth of errors during close encounters can be amplified by as much as @xmath4 , however some of the growth can be recovered after the encounter is over .",
    "the sensitivity to small changes in initial conditions and numerical errors is a property associated with chaotic systems .",
    "a measure of the sensitivity of numerical errors can be determined by the lyapunov exponent @xmath5 .",
    "early work suggested that the lyapunov exponent is inversely proportional to the crossing time @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggest a dependence on @xmath0 of the form @xmath7 or perhaps @xmath8 , implying that as @xmath0 increases the rate of separation decreases and the lyapunov exponent increases .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence was later numerically verified by @xcite .    despite the difficulty calculating solutions to @xmath0-body integrations",
    ", computers still remain a useful tool to study self gravitating systems .",
    "if numerical errors in numerical solutions to the @xmath0-body problem cause such drastic changes in the actual positions and velocities of particles how can we trust the dynamics that these solutions represent ? shadowing is a way of proving that a true solution to a dynamical system follows close to a numerical solution .",
    "if true orbits can be found close to numerical orbits then the dynamics represented by the numerical solutions represents true dynamics .",
    "this study will discuss the existence of shadow orbits for the gravitational 3-body problem .",

    "next , a refinement procedure which makes corrections to numerical orbits to reduce the errors incurred at each time step will be presented .",
    "the sitnikov problem will then be presented and used as a simple model to discuss escape and capture of orbits .",
    "an approximate poincar map is then presented to model orbits of the sitnikov problem and will be used in conjunction with the refinement procedure to discuss the validity of numerical solutions by way of shadowing . the failure of the refinement procedure to find shadow orbits will then be discussed and regions of phase - space where the procedure fails will be delineated . finally , it will be demonstrated that the shadow times for this problem can be modeled as a poisson process .",

    "it would be expected that , like the results found in this study , shadowing with the refinement procedure breaks down near boundaries of escape for unstable orbits .",
    "in fact , the break down of the refinement procedure near escape boundaries would be expected for general 3-body configurations .",
    "as solutions approach parabolic escape boundaries , an orbit can undergo increasingly long ejections from the left - over binary system .",
    "small changes in the energy of an orbit in this region can cause significant changes in the time of return for the orbit .",
    "if the refinement procedure could make changes to the orbits so as to conserve the energy of the ejected body it might improve the success rate of the refinement procedure . finally , the sitnikov 4-body problem @xcite provides a starting point for examining the relationship between the shadowing distance and the number of bodies .",
    "extra bodies can be added in circular orbits about the center of mass .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that as the number of moving bodies in a fixed potential increases the shadow durations decrease .",
    "it would be of interest to determine if a similar relationship holds for the sitnikov @xmath0-body problem .",
    "it should be stressed again that the failure of the refinement procedure does not necessarily mean that a shadow does not exist for a given pseudo - orbit .",
    "it may very well be that shadows do exist for orbits in regions where the refinement procedure fails .",
    "we are encouraged that this may be the case .",
    "both the sitnikov problem and the approximate poincar map possess a hyperbolic invariant set , @xmath164 , near the escape boundaries ( see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) . despite the fact that @xmath164 is near the boundary @xmath108 , the shadowing theorems by @xcite and @xcite guarantee that any pseudo - orbit on @xmath164 has an associated shadow - orbit .",
    "this demonstrates that being in the vicinity on the escape boundary does not necessarily rule out the existence of shadow - orbits .",
