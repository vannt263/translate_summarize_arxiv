    "[ sec : stress ] .",
    "the existence of such h ",
    "h bonds are most notable difference from hydrogenated small pt clusters which have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite      in the previous section , we have seen that there are several interesting bonding patterns found in the hydrogenated pd clusters .",
    "we investigate these bonds in detail via the electronic stress tensor analysis .",
    "before we discuss the pd clusters , we show how the chemical bond of the hydrogen molecule is expressed by the electronic stress tensor ( eq .  ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_hh ] , on the left panel , we plot the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor and corresponding eigenvector on the plane including the internuclear axis . on the right panel",
    ", we plot the tension vector ( eq .  ) , which is normalized and whose norm is expressed by the color of the arrows .",
    "the sign of the largest eigenvalue tells whether electrons at a certain point in space feel tensile force ( positive eigenvalue ) or compressive force ( negative eigenvalue ) and the eigenvector tells the direction of the force .",
    "we can see that the region with positive eigenvalue spreads between the h atoms , which corresponds to the formation of a covalent bond . in that region ,",
    "the eigenvectors form a bundle of flow lines that connects the h nuclei .",
    "such a region , called  spindle structure \" @xcite , is clearly seen in the panel . on the right panel ,",
    "the vanishing point of tension vector  lagrange point \" ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rdft ] ) is found at the midpoint of the internuclear axis , which is quite reasonable .",
    "we will now turn to the hydrogenated pd clusters .",
    "we first look at the pd ",
    "pd bridging bond in pd@xmath9h@xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd6h14_bridge ] .",
    "we see the spindle structure between pd and h just like the h@xmath10 molecule mentioned above , indicating the covalency of the pd ",
    "h bond here .",
    "as for the pd  pd bond , although we found a lagrange point and flow of the eigenvectors connecting pd atoms , the eigenvalue in the region between pd atoms has negative value .",
    "this indicates that the interaction between these two pd atoms is weak and the bond between them is different from a covalent bond characterized by a spindle structure .",
    "we shall call this pattern a  pseudo - spindle structure \" .",
    "namely , the pseudo - spindle structure has similar eigenvector flow to that of the spindle structure between two atoms but with negative eigenvalue region between them .",
    "we next examine the very weak pd ",
    "h bond which is found in the four - fold bond in pd@xmath42h@xmath43 .",
    "there are two h atoms which have bonds between four pd atoms and two of them are very weak ( see tables [ tab : bond_type ] and [ tab : bond_type_2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : pd9h22_pdh ] focuses on one of such h atom ( h(17 ) ) and shows one weaker pd  h bond ( pd(3)h(17 ) ) and one stronger bond ( pd(4)h(17 ) ) ( other two bonds , pd(1)h(17 ) and pd(7)h(17 ) , are off this plane ) .",
    "the stronger one has the spindle structure and is similar to the one in the pd ",
    "h  pd bridging bond .",
    "although the weaker one has a long bond distance ( 2.59@xmath53 ) and negative eigenvalue region around the lagrange point , there is a flow which connects pd(3 ) and h(17 ) so we regard this as a bond . in other words ,",
    "this bond is characterized by the pseudo - spindle structure .",
    "this classification that shorter bonds are characterized by spindle structures and longer ones are by pseudo - spindle structures seems to hold rather in general for the hydrogenated pd clusters we have investigated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bo ] , we have defined two groups  a \" and  b \" for the pd ",
    "h bonds where the former ( the latter ) has bond length shorter ( longer ) than about 1.9 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bo ] , we have pointed out that they are on slopes with different inclination in the bond order v.s . bond length plot . from the viewpoint of the electronic stress tensor ,",
    "group a is characterized by a spindle structure and the group b by a pseudo - spindle structure .",
    "finally , we discuss the h ",
    "h bonds in pd@xmath38h@xmath39 , pd@xmath9h@xmath11 and pd@xmath40h@xmath41 .",
    "their bond lengths are respectively 1.56@xmath53 , 1.63@xmath53 and 2.03@xmath53 , which are longer than that of the h@xmath10 molecule . from the structural point of view , the h ",
    "h in pd@xmath38h@xmath39 is located outside the pd cage .",
    "h in pd@xmath9h@xmath11 is completely contained in the pd cage and the one in pd@xmath40h@xmath41 is marginally within the pd cage .",
    "as before , we show the electronic stress tensor and tension for these bonds in figs .",
    "[ fig : pd5h10_hh ] , [ fig : pd6h14_hh ] and [ fig : pd7h16_hh ] . in these figures ,",
    "there are more than three labelled atoms but they are all on the same plane ( the distance between the plane and the labelled atoms are less than 0.01@xmath53 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd7h16_hh ] , left panel , there is a region with negative eigenvalue ( shown by a blue circular region ) at the lower - center part of the panel .",
    "this is caused by the existence of pd(6 ) but , since it locates slightly above this plane ( about 0.4@xmath53 ) , it is not labelled .    in these figures",
    ", we see that all the regions between pd and h have a spindle structures , suggesting covalency of the pd  h bonds . as for the h ",
    "h bonds , there is a spindle structure for the one in pd@xmath38h@xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd5h10_hh ] ) .",
    "h bonds in pd@xmath9h@xmath11 and pd@xmath40h@xmath41 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pd6h14_hh ] and [ fig : pd7h16_hh ] ) are characterized by the negative eigenvalue region and eigenvectors connecting h atoms , namely a pseudo - spindle structure .      in this section",
    ", we propose a way to improve our definition of bond order and apply it to the hydrogenated pd clusters . as is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : rdft ] , our bond order @xmath44 is defined from the energy density evaluated at the lagrange point . in the previous paper @xcite , using many kinds of hydrocarbon molecules , it has been shown that this definition manifests a nice feature as a bond order . however , it is not difficult to imagine a type of chemical bond which can not be well characterized by a single point between two atoms",
    ". this would be true for chemical bonds where spatially extended @xmath54-orbitals are involved .",
    "then , we consider it is worthwhile to investigate this issue by expanding our bond order definition by taking the surface integral of energy density instead of the energy density at the lagrange point .    then , we need to determine the surface over which we integrate the energy density . the most natural choice would be a  lagrange surface \" @xcite which is constructed from a family of lines which going out from a lagrange point ( if a lagrange surface includes a lagrange point ) .",
    "namely , we define bond order of the bond between atoms a and b as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the lagrange surface between atoms a and b. as is the cases of @xmath44 ( eq .  ) and @xmath45 ( eq .  ) , we normalize by the value of hydrogen molecule .    unfortunately , however , this lagrange surface is not so easy to define numerically . hence we instead take the surface integral over the plane which includes a lagrange point and is perpendicular to the axis connecting two atoms .",
    "note that such a plane coincides with a lagrange surface in the case of homonuclear diatomic molecules .",
    "the results of the @xmath57 calculation are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bes ] and [ fig : bes_be ] .",
    "we see that @xmath57 is calculated to be larger than @xmath58 for most of the bonds in the hydrogenated pd clusters .",
    "this comes from the fact that the energy density distribution in those clusters is spatially extended relative to that of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "the ratio of @xmath57 to @xmath44 is especially large for pd ",
    "pd bonds as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bes_be ] .",
    "this in turn is considered to be due to the @xmath54-orbitals of pd atoms participating in the bonds .",
    "in this paper , we have applied recently developed method to analyze electronic structure via electronic stress tensor to the small hydrogenated pd clusters whose structures have been known @xcite . from the results of ab",
    "initio electronic structure calculation of these clusters , we calculated quantities which are defined at each point in space : stress tensor , tension , energy density and regional chemical potential .",
    "the chemical bond is characterized by the lagrange point , where the tension vanishes and bond orders are defined by the energy density or chemical potential at that point .",
    "we have confirmed that thus defined bond orders are useful to classify the chemical bonds in pd clusters as had been done for pt clusters @xcite and al@xmath12 clusters @xcite .",
    "for some of the bonds , we have done more detailed analysis by drawing the eigenvalue of stress tensor , corresponding eigenvectors and tension vectors . in particular , the weak bonds with long bond distances suggested by the lagrange point search in our bond order analysis",
    "are confirmed to have a flow of eigenvectors connecting bonded atoms .",

    "as for the pd  h bond , it has been shown to be classified into two groups .",

    "we proposed a terminology  pseudo - spindle structure \" in this paper but actually , there already has been such a structure found in our previous study for c@xmath10h@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the negative eigenvalue of c@xmath10h@xmath10 is caused by the compressive stress nearby the c nuclei .",
    "in general , the stress tensor has a large negative eigenvalue in radial direction in neighborhood of a nucleus due the dominance of the attractive coulomb force . in the case of c@xmath10h@xmath10 ,",
    "the bond length is too short that the internuclear region is immersed under the atomic compressive stress @xcite .",
    "this is a pseudo - spindle structure in a strong bond .",
    "we can say that we have found in this paper two more types of pseudo spindle structure .",
    "one is the pseudo - spindle structure associated with very long and weak h ",
    "h bond and pd  h bond .",
    "another is the pseudo - spindle structure associated with a bond between metallic atoms , pd  pd bond .",
