    "the relic ( primordial ) gravitational waves generated in the early universe is a basic prediction in the modern cosmology , which depends only on the validity of general relativity and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the relic gravitational waves ( rgws ) leave the imprints in all the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropy power spectra , including the tt , te , ee and bb . in the near future ,",
    "these provide the unique way to detect it in the observations . if the amplitude of the rgws is large , ( i.e. the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath7 ) , the cmb tt and te information channels can dominate the detection , since the amplitudes of these spectra generated by rgws are much larger than those of ee and bb @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath8 , these channels become useless due to the cosmic variance , and the detection can only be done through the b - mode polarization @xcite .    in the era before the release of the planck polarization data , the detection ( or constraint ) of rgws mainly depends on the cmb tt and te channels , which has been done by many groups , including the wmap and planck teams .",
    "it is well known that the tt and te power spectra generated by rgws are significant only in the large scales , i.e. the low multipoles @xmath9 . however , in the previous analyses , nearly all the groups utilized the full cmb data till to the very high multipoles ( @xmath10 for wmap and @xmath11 for planck ) , and assumed density perturbations with a constant or a running spectral index .",
    "this can easily overlook the contribution of rgws , due to the degeneracies among various cosmological parameters ( in particular , the degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .    in 2006 ,",
    "basksran , grishchuk and polnarev noticed that the wmap te data are systematically smaller than the predictions of the best - fit cosmological model @xcite , where the rgws are absent , and argued that this might hint the existence of rgws . in 2009 , for the first time , one of us ( w.zhao ) with baskaran and grishchuk carefully analyzed the three - year wmap te data in the low multipoles @xmath14 , and gotten the constraints on the quadrupole ratio @xmath15 ( note that the tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have extended this analysis to the five - year and seven - year wmap tt and te data in the low multipoles @xmath14 , and found that the indication of rgws were stabilized : five - year data give @xmath17 @xcite , and seven - year data yield @xmath18 @xcite . in these analyses , we have adopted an approximate effective noises and the likelihood functions for the wmap data , which are based on the exact wishart distribution for the full - sky observables .",
    "however , these approximations were questioned by some authors ( see for instance @xcite ) . to clarify it , in paper @xcite",
    ", we adopted the commonly used cosmomc numerical package to repeat the wmap7 analysis .",
    "we found the maximize likelihood ( ml ) values are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and one - dimensional ( 1d ) marginalized likelihood gives the constraints : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the cosmomc approach reduced the confidence of the indications from approximately 2@xmath23 level to approximately 1@xmath23 level , but the indications do not disappear altogether .",
    "recently , planck team released their cmb tt data , and shown some differences in the low multipoles compared with the wmap data @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall repeat the analysis in @xcite based on the combination of planck tt data and nine - year wmap te data @xcite , and investigate the hint of rgws in these new data , where the public cosmomc numerical package is used for the data analysis .",
    "as anticipated , we found that the new data favor the gravitational waves with @xmath24 , and a blue tilted spectrum of density perturbation with @xmath25 .",
    "so , the new data stabilize what we found in the previous work @xcite .",
    "relic gravitational waves compete with density perturbations in generating cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies at low multipoles @xmath26 .",
    "therefore we focus on the planck tt data and wmap9 te data at @xmath0 . limited by the data number in our analysis , it is impossible to determinate all the cosmological parameters together .",
    "similar to our previous works @xcite , we fix the background parameters at their best - fit values in the @xmath27cdm model @xcite : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the free parameters subject to evaluation by the data analysis are the parameters : the amplitude and the spectral index of density perturbations @xmath32 , @xmath13 , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath12 .",
    "note that , throughout this paper , we shall adopt the spectral amplitudes and the spectral indices at the pivot wavenumber @xmath3mpc@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , we also consider other two cases : _ case ii _ with @xmath42 and _ case iii _ with @xmath43 .",
    "the former case is nearly kept for the most inflationary models . the latter case with @xmath43",
    "is insisted by some authors @xcite , which is valid if the expansion history of inflation can be approximated as a power - law form of the conformal time .",
    "the results for these two cases are presented in table 1 and in fig . 1 where the red and blue curves correspond to _ case ii _ and _ case iii _ ,",
    "respectively . from table 1 and",
    ", we see that the results in both _ case ii _ and _ case iii _ are quite similar to those in _ case i_. we conclude the assumption on @xmath33 can not significantly influence our results .    before the end of this section",
    ", we need to mention that there is some awkwardness in the choice of the background parameters , as these are the parameters derived by planck @xcite .",
    "actually the choice of these background parameters does not significantly affect the tt and te spectra at low multipoles @xcite .",
    "as we know from our previous experiences @xcite , the background parameters , if changed not too much , do not significantly affect the results . in order to make sure of it",
    ", we also fixed the background parameters to be wmap best - fit values , and obtained similar results .",
    "nevertheless , for the safety , we shall explicitly explore the issue of background parameters in a separate work @xcite .",
