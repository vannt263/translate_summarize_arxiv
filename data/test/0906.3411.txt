    "ls5039 harbours an o6.5v type star in a 3.9 day orbit , the massive star in the other systems is of be type .",
    "psrb1259@xmath663 is the only one of these systems in which the nature of the compact companion ( a 48  ms period radio pulsar in a 3.4  year orbit around the star ) has been identified .",
    "all three systems display similarities in their radio to tev @xmath0-ray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) including a hard x - ray spectrum and a softer tev spectrum , radio emission above 1ghz and variability in all bands .",
    "there is also evidence for a single tev flare from the luminous x - ray binary cygnus x-1  @xcite , a system of a black hole and an o9.7 iab star in a 5.6 day circular orbit .",
    "the point - like tev source hessj0632 + 057  @xcite , has been suggested as a new member of this class of objects .",
    "this suggestion was based on associations with the massive star mwc148 ( hd259440 ) and the unidentified rosat and egret sources 1rxsj063258.3 + 054857 and 3egj0634 + 0521 , and would imply that mwc148 has a hidden compact companion .",
    "x - ray observations of this source with xmm - newton in 2007 revealed a point - like , hard spectrum ( @xmath7@xmath41.26 ) , x - ray source at the position of mwc148 @xcite .",
    "significant variability was detected on timescales of a few hours .",
    "the association of this x - ray source with the tev source ( and both sources with mwc148 ) seems highly likely and the spectral properties of the x - ray/@xmath0-ray source are consistent with the known @xmath0-ray binaries .",
    "very recently the veritas collaboration have published flux upper limits which imply variability in the tev emission of this object @xcite .",
    "historical studies of mwc148 have determined the star to be of spectral type b0pe @xcite .",
    "be stars are classified by the presence of balmer emission lines .",
    "mwc148 was rejected as a herbig aebe star due to a non - detection during the iras survey @xcite and thus is believed to represent one of the ` classical ' be stars .",
    "these stars are fast rotators , thought to be spinning at 50 - 90% of their critical velocity ( note @xcite give @xmath8sin@xmath9 of mwc148 to be 430kms@xmath10 ) with a large stellar wind and a high mass loss rate .",
    "the flattening of the circumstellar envelope produces a global polarisation of the envelope of a few percent .",
    "the most recent measured values of the polarisation of mwc148 are 3 - 4% @xcite .",
    "the star also exhibits a significant infrared excess ( see 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consistent with the existence of an extended envelope .",
    "the source lies between the monoceros loop supernova remnant and the star forming regions of the rosetta nebula ( @xmath111.4kpc ) . a compatible distance estimate of @xmath41.5kpc is calculated using the apparent visual magnitude of mwc148 , @xmath12 = 9.1 @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "no variability was detected from the star during the asas-3 optical survey @xcite .",
    "bp stars are defined by their unusual surface abundances and strong ( up to kg , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surface magnetic fields @xcite . the confinement of the stellar wind in these strong fields is thought to lead to strong shock heating and variable x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite speculate that such a process may be capable of accelerating particles up to tev energies .",
    "all of the known binaries have been detected at radio wavelengths at flux levels of 10100mjy ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "the radio flux is modulated with the orbital period , whereas in ls5039 , the radio emission ( unlike the x - ray and tev emission ) is not ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . *",
    "no targeted radio observations of mwc148 had previously been conducted . here",
    "we present new radio observations resulting in a detection of the system with both the vla and the gmrt .",

    "however , source # 3 was not detected during this observation , presumably due to a low flux state of this object .",
    "a plausible alternative reason for the non - detection is that the source is extended on scales significantly larger than the @xmath27 beam ( but smaller than the 2@xmath14 1.28ghz gmrt beam ) , reducing the signal / noise achievable in this configuration . to circumvent this issue , the a configuration data were tapered to match the 2@xmath14 1.28ghz gmrt beam and rms point source limits at 5 and 8ghz",

    "the new gmrt data provides the best constraint on the size of the radio emitting region in mwc148 .",
    "the upper limit on the source size ( along the short axis of the gmrt beam ) is 2@xmath14 . assuming a distance to the star of 1.5 kpc , this corresponds to an upper limit on the emission region of 3000au .",
    "significant variability was detected in the 5ghz emission from mwc148 at the 5@xmath15 level .",
    "variability at the same level may be present in the 1.28ghz data but not detectable above the noise .",
    "the non - detection during the vla a configuration observations further demonstrates the variable nature of the source .",
    "the variability timescale must be longer than the @xmath42hour scans and shorter than the @xmath3month timescale separation of the observations .",
    "an estimate of the spectral index , based on the average flux at 1.28ghz and 5ghz , was calculated for source # 3 to be @xmath30 = 0.6 @xmath20 0.2 . however",
    ", this value should be treated with caution due to the non - simultaneous nature of the 1.28ghz and 5ghz observations .",
    "the new radio source lies less than @xmath31@xmath14 from the centroid of the x - ray emission @xcite , and within the 1@xmath15 error box of hessj0632 + 057 * ( see fig .",
    "2)*. thus we confidently identify this emission as the radio counterpart to mwc148 .",
    "it seems very likely that all these objects are associated and therefore we can create an sed as shown in fig .",
    "the recent publication of the fermi bright source list @xcite allows us to place constraints on the gev emission from hessj0632 + 057 .",
    "as no source was detected ( above 10@xmath15 in the first 3 months of operation ) at the position of hessj0632 + 057 , the egret source 3egj0634 + 0521 can be ruled out as a potential counterpart .",
    "limits for the gev emission after 3 months , and 1 year of fermi data have been added to the sed .",
    "the detection of tev emission implies particle acceleration is taking place in the source .",
    "the most natural explanation for the observed radio emission is then optically thin synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons .",
    "synchrotron radiation with a spectral index @xmath30.5 implies an underlying electron spectrum with @xmath31 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the injection spectrum .",
    "ic cooling in the thomson regime is hard to avoid for these electrons .",
    "if the observed spectrum is cooled , then this implies a very hard injection spectrum .",
    "this scenario was the one presented in @xcite , in which there is a low energy cut - off in the injection spectrum , resulting in an effectively mono - energetic injection for electrons below this cut - off energy .",
    "synchrotron cooling of such an injection will produce a time averaged electron spectral index of 2 and an emission spectrum with @xmath2=0.5 . the simple one - zone model presented in @xcite and adjusted to fit the x - ray and tev data , results in a radio spectrum remarkably similar to that observed . a better fit to the radio data can be achieved by adjusting the low - energy cut - off or a change in injection index from 2.0 to 1.9 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . assuming a one - zone model with the parameters described in @xcite , @xmath32  =  70 mg , @xmath33  =  1erg@xmath34",
    ", the radio emission at 5ghz would be produced by @xmath390  mev electrons having a characteristic cooling time due to ic losses of @xmath42 days .",
    "similarly , 1.3ghz emission would be produced by 50mev electrons with a cooling time of @xmath34 days .",
    "the observed variability timescale , in common with that seen in x - rays , is comparable with the expected cooling times , even if the radio emission region is somewhat larger than the few au assumed .",
    "we note that if the emission region was considerably smaller than this both significant free - free absorption at 1ghz in the stellar wind and @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption at a few hundred gev on stellar photons would likely become apparent at some orbital phases . at this stage",
    "neither effect can be excluded .",
    "strictly simultaneous multi - frequency radio data would be required to check for radio absorption features .",
    "there are two main scenarios that could plausibly explain the observed emission from hessj0632 + 057 ; firstly that the star is isolated , with a magnetically confined wind region and secondly that the star is in a binary system with an unseen compact companion .",
    "although there are some interesting similarities between mwc148 and the archetypal isolated magnetic bp star @xmath15 ori e , including similar x - ray variability timescales @xcite , there are also significant differences .",
    "the x - ray emission from @xmath15 ori e can be well fit by a two - temperature _ apec _ model with a hot component of @xmath42.6kev whereas the x - ray emission from mwc148 can only be fit with such a model if the temperature of the hot component is well above 10kev , due to the substantial flux in the 510kev band . at radio wavelengths @xmath15 ori e displays a flat spectrum ( @xmath35 0)between 220ghz , whereas the emission from mwc148 appears to have a negative spectral index .",
    "the radio light - curve of @xmath15 ori e is strongly modulated with the orbital period .",
    "this may also be the case with mwc148 , but further observations are clearly needed to characterise its radio variability .    as can be clearly seen in tab .  1",
    "there is a strong resemblance between the known @xmath0-ray binaries and hessj0632 + 057 .",
    "although hessj0632 + 057 is a much weaker source in all wavelengths , the similar spectral properties make a convincing argument that this object does indeed represent a new @xmath0-ray emitting binary system . *",
    "the apparent variability in the tev emission of hessj0632 + 057 , as inferred by the veritas collaboration @xcite , is also consistent with the properties of the known @xmath0-ray binary systems . *",
    "all objects in tab .",
    "1 exhibit a hard ( @xmath36 1 ) spectrum in the x - ray domain , with hessj0632 + 057 having a particularly hard spectrum .",
    "the tev spectral indices of all objects are consistent with each other and all considerably softer than the corresponding x - ray spectrum .",
    "all objects appear to have their peak energy output in the mev to gev range .",
    "note that gev emission has only been detected using fermi coincident with lsi+61303 and ls5039 @xcite .",
    "upper limits for the other sources have been estimated using detected sources close to the objects of interest to determine the local detection threshold .",
    "the @xmath0-ray binaries all display variable radio emission with a wide range of spectral properties including low energy spectral turnovers ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the clear outlier in this group is cygnusx-1 , for example , although the radio and vhe @xmath0-ray luminosities are similar , the x - ray luminosity of cygnusx-1 is orders of magnitude greater than the other objects .",
    "resolved radio emission has been detected in both lsi+61303 and ls5039 @xcite with emission regions of the order of @xmath310au .",
    "our current observations are unable to probe such small scales and more data is required in order to resolve or further constrain the size of the emitting region and move towards a better understanding of this source . whilst the detection of variable radio emission from mwc148 further strengthens the case that hessj0632 + 057 is indeed a tev binary , the scenario that this object is an ( extremely unusual ) isolated massive star remains an intriguing possibility .",
