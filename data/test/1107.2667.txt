    "among the quasiprobability functions that represent the density operator of a quantum state , the wigner distribution has undoubtedly advantages over others , since in this phase space representation the quantum - classical correspondence is , in general , much more visible . at the same time",
    "these functions contain all information available in the density operator .",

    "the wigner distribution of this state was obtained exactly using the solution derived from the complex p - representation ( after adiabatic elimination of the pump mode ) @xcite , and tranformed into a wigner distribution .",
    "since this analytical result appears as an infinite series of gamma functions ( hypergeometric series ) , some important physical aspects are hidden by its mathematical complexity .",
    "for example , two - mode entanglement is not of easy identification from the usual partial transpose criterion @xcite .",
    "the same happens to the generalized p - representation for the intracavity parametric oscillator derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to calculate the intensity correlations",
    ", the authors obtained an integral expression that depends on degenerate hypergeometric functions , and the outcome also depends on an infinite sum .    in the present work ,",
    "we derive the wigner function of a two - mode quantum state of the electromagnetic field generated by an opo using a truncated wigner equation .",
    "this truncated approximation is valid when the nonlinearity is small enough , which is true for most of the opo experiments developed so far .",
    "a simple expression is obtained for the wigner distribution , which renders clear the many quantum features of the intracavity opo field such as squeezing and entanglement . moreover ,",
    "this expression is valid in all regions of the opo operation regimes , that is , below , and above threshold , where the validity of both the linear approximation , and the perturbation theory break down .",
    "this distribution also describes the opo quantum fluctuations properly around the operation threshold , while the usual linear approach provides divergent results . in order to illustrate the reliability of the distribution we obtain , we compare moments calculated with this wigner function with those obtained by numerical simulations using the positive p - representation of the density operator without any approximations , that is , full quantum result for any control parameters of the opo .",

    "after truncation and adiabatic elimination a two - mode fokker - planck is obtained which does not satisfy the conditions for a steady - state potential solution .",

    "all statistical properties , including experimentally accessible quantities like quadrature noise and correlations in the stationary state may be calculated with this distribution in any operation regime of the opo within the validity of the adiabatic elimination .",
    "it is interesting to note that the distribution given by expression ( [ 11 ] ) is single peaked below threshold operation ( @xmath40 ) and becomes double peaked above threshold . in fig .",
    "2 , it is possible to visualize the conditional wigner distribution for fixed values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for an opo operating below , at , and above threshold .",

    "therefore , the first two terms in the exponent of the wigner distribution governs the opo behaviour below threshold .",
    "they are enough to predict the usual nonclassical features .",
    "in fact , it is evident now that the usual linearized approach to quantum noise in below - threshold opos is equivalent to completely neglect the @xmath44 term in the distribution .",
    "however , it is important to notice that for @xmath45 , the wigner distribution becomes divergent if we neglect the @xmath44 term .",
    "this means that this term plays a crucial role for a complete description of the opo behaviour at and above threshold .",
    "additional insight is provided by a careful investigation of the marginal distribution obtained by integrating @xmath46 with respect to one mode variables .",
    "of course , due to the symmetry of @xmath47 , the form of the resulting marginal distribution is independent of the mode being traced out .",

    "the variances given by this marginal distribution are larger than those of the vacuum state .",

    "[ fig3 ] presents the marginal distribution below , at and above threshold . above threshold the marginal distribution",
    "is clearly peaked out of the phase space origin , what is a consequence of the macroscopic amplification of the down - converted fields .",
    "however , the distribution presents radial symmetry indicating complete phase uncertainty in each individual mode .",
    "almost the totality of theoretical works devoted to the analysis of quantum noise in optical systems rely on linearization of the small quantum fluctuations around the macroscopic steady state mean values .",
    "it is worth to notice that this procedure has limited validity , especially around the threshold critical point where quantum fluctuations may become comparable to the mean values . in order to evidence the breakdown of the linearized theory",
    ", we shall compare its results with those obtained from the solution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ 10 ] ) .    the usual approach given to quantum noise in the literature",
    "is obtained from first order stochastic equations of motion @xcite .",
    "these equations are often used to predict squeezing in a linearized fluctuation analysis .",
    "they are non - classical in the sense that they can describe states without a positive glauber - sudarshan p - distribution , but correspond to a gaussian wigner distribution .",
    "we now find it useful to introduce combined field quadratures , as in two - mode approaches used previously  @xcite .",
    "these combined quadratures are the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) variables used to characterize continuous variable entanglement between the down converted fields .",
    "they are defined as @xmath49 these quantities correspond to the squeezed and anti - squeezed combined quadratures obtained in the linearized theory . from the first order",
    "stochastic equations one can easily obtain the steady state variances of the epr variables @xcite : @xmath50 for below threshold operation , and @xmath51 for above threshold operation .",
    "now let us briefly discuss the predictions of the linearized approach and its validity .",
    "the quadratures @xmath52 and @xmath53 exhibit the expected squeezing , going from the vacuum fluctuations for zero pump until 50% intracavity squeezing ( which corresponds to perfect squeezing outside the cavity ) at and above the oscillation threshold .",
    "the unsqueezed quadratures @xmath54 and @xmath55 present divergent behaviour around threshold , which is certainly not physical . in fact , as we shall see next , the steady state solution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ 10 ] ) gives a well behaved wigner distribution which does not display any divergences .",
    "this wigner distribution will also put limits on the amount of squeezing attainable .    in order to investigate the two - mode entanglement directly from the wigner distribution ,",
    "we now write it in terms of the epr variables . below threshold , where the linearization of the equation of motion is valid , we can neglect the @xmath56 term , and the distribution can be approximated as    @xmath57 \\right\\}\\;.   \\label{weprl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with this expression we can easily calculate any moment of the distribution . for instance , we easily reobtain the results of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : variancesbelow ] ) for the intracavity noise squeezing in the combined quadratures .",
    "as we mentioned before , at threshold we have perfect external squeezing while the unsqueezed combined quadratures blow up showing the failure of linearization @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is easy to characterize this state as entangled by using the duan - simon criterion @xcite . above threshold",
    "we can also calculate the moments and we find that this criterion shows the sufficient condition to characterize this state as entangled , in spite of not being a gaussian state in that regime .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the results obtained for @xmath58 with the linearized theory ( both below and above threshold ) with those obtained from the wigner function given by eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "( [ limiar ] ) .",
    "while the linearized approach gives a divergent behavior at the oscillation threshold , the results obtained from the truncated wigner function gives a more realistic smooth behavior in agreement with the full quantum solution of refs .",
    "the results for the squeezed quadrature @xmath59 are shown in fig .",
    "[ limiar2 ] where , again , the results given by the truncated wigner distribution agree with those obtained from the full quantum solution . below threshold , the linearized approach also agrees with the full quantum theory and the truncated wigner approach , but an important deviation can be observed above threshold where the linearized theory gives @xmath60 for any pump power .",
    "the same results are obtained for the other squeezed variable @xmath61 , so that the duan - simon separability criterion @xcite shows that the two - mode quantum state is entangled .",
    "however , note that both the full quantum approach and the truncated wigner distribution predict a less pronounced violation of the criterion above threshold .    in refs .",
    "@xcite fokker - planck equations were derived for the complex - p @xcite and positive - p @xcite representations , and stationary solutions were obtained for the corresponding distributions . since these fokker - planck equations were derived without any truncation , we can consider the stationary distributions so obtained as _ exact_. in ref .",
    "@xcite an exact stationary wigner function was mapped from the complex - p distribution of ref .",

    "then we showed that the fokker - planck admits a simple  quasi - potential \" solution .",
    "for the unsqueezed quadratures , this solution does not present the unphysical divergent behavior of the linearized theory on the oscillation threshold .",

    "( [ 5b ] ) assumes the form of a standard fokker - planck equation , leading to the usual diffusive evolution with a possible stationary state ( under self pulsing conditions , for instance , there is no stationary solution ) .",
    "finally , there are effects of the @xmath71 term which are essentially quantum mechanical , but have received little attention in the literature .",

    "here we clarify the steady state solution derivation of the effective fokker - planck equation for the two down - converted modes of the field , after adiabatic elimination of the pump .",

    "<S> when the elimination is correctly executed , the resulting stochastic equations contain multiplicative noise terms , and do not admit a potential solution . </S>",
    "<S> however , we develop an heuristic scheme leading to a satisfactory steady - state solution . this provides a clear view of the intracavity two - mode entangled state valid in all operating regimes of the opo . </S>",
    "<S> a nongaussian distribution is obtained for the above threshold solution . </S>"
