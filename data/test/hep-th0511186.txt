    "<S> we study the generation and evolution of gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) in the context of randall - sundrum braneworld cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the initial and final stages of the background cosmological model are given by de sitter and minkowski phases , respectively , and they are connected smoothly by a radiation - dominated phase . </S>",
    "<S> this setup allows us to discuss the quantum - mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the final amplitude of the well - defined zero mode . using the wronskian formulation , we numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves , and find that the effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the kaluza - klein modes is subdominant , contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is confirmed that the damping due to the kaluza - klein mode generation and the enhancement due to the modification of the background friedmann equation are the two dominant effects , but they cancel each other , leading to the same spectral tilt as the standard four - dimensional result . </S>",
    "<S> kaluza - klein gravitons that escape from the brane contribute to the energy density of the dark radiation at late times . we show that a tiny amount of the dark radiation is generated due to this process . </S>"
