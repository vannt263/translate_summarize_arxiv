    "although standard four - dimensional ( 4d ) general relativity ( gr ) is believed to be the correct description of gravity at the classical level , its quantization faces many well - known problems .",
    "therefore , three - dimensional ( 3d ) gravity has gained much interest , since classically it is much simpler and thus one can investigate more efficiently its quantization . amongst others , in 3d gravity",
    "one obtains the banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole  @xcite , which is a solution to the einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this black - hole solution presents interesting properties at both classical and quantum levels , and it shares several features of the kerr black hole of 4d gr  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , remarkable attention was addressed recently to topologically massive gravity , which is a generalization of 3d gr that amounts to augment the einstein - hilbert action by adding a chern - simons gravitational term , and thus the propagating degree of freedom is a massive graviton , which amongst others also admits btz black - hole as exact solutions  @xcite .",
    "the renewed interest on topologically massive gravity relies on the possibility of constructing a chiral theory of gravity at a special point of the parameter - space , as it was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this idea has been extensively analyzed in the last years  @xcite , leading to a fruitful discussion that ultimately led to a significantly better understanding of the model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , another 3d massive gravity theory known as new massive gravity @xcite ( where the action is given by the einstein - hilbert term plus a specific combination of square - curvature terms which gives rise to field equations with a second order trace ) have attracted considerable attention , this theory also admits interesting solutions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 3d gravity with torsion has been extensively studied in  @xcite and references therein .    on the other hand ,",
    "hairy black holes are interesting solutions of einstein s theory of gravity and also of certain types of modified gravity theories .",
    "the first attempts to couple a scalar field to gravity was done in an asymptotically flat spacetime . then , hairy black hole solutions were found @xcite but these solutions were not examples of hairy black hole configurations violating the no - hair theorems because they were not physically acceptable as the scalar field was divergent on the horizon and stability analysis showed that they were unstable @xcite . to remedy",
    "this a regularization procedure has to be used to make the scalar field finite on the horizon .",
    "hairy black hole solutions have been extensively studied over the years mainly in connection with the no - hair theorems .",
    "the recent developments in string theory and specially the application of the ads / cft principle to condense matter phenomena like superconductivity ( for a review see @xcite ) , triggered the interest of further study of the behavior of matter fields outside the black hole horizon @xcite",
    ". there are also very interesting recent developments in observational astronomy .",
    "high precision astronomical observations of the supermassive black holes may pave the way to experimentally test the no - hair conjecture @xcite .",
    "also , there are numerical investigations of single and binary black holes in the presence of scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned is a small part on the relevance that has taken the study of hairy black holes currently in the field of physics , for more details see for instance @xcite and references therein . also , we refer the reader to references @xcite and references therein , where black holes solutions in three space - time dimensions with a scalar field ( minimally and/or confomally ) coupled to gravity have been investigated .    in the present work we are interested in investigating the existence of 3d hairy black holes solutions for theories based on torsion .",
    "in particular , the so - called  teleparallel equivalent of general relativity \" ( tegr ) @xcite is an equivalent formulation of gravity but instead of using the curvature defined via the levi - civita connection , it uses the weitzenbck connection that has no curvature but only torsion .",
    "so , we consider a scalar field non - minimally coupled with the torsion scalar , with a self - interacting potential in tegr , and we find three - dimensional asymptotically ads , hairy black holes .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that this kind of theory ( known as scalar - torsion theory ) , has been studied in the cosmological context , where the dark energy sector is attributed to the scalar field .",
    "it was shown that the minimal case is equivalent to standard quintessence . however , the nonminimal case has a richer structure , exhibiting quintessence - like or phantom - like behavior , or experiencing the phantom - divide crossing @xcite , see also @xcite for aplications of this theory ( with a complex scalar field ) to boson stars .",
    "it is also worth to mention that a natural extension of tegr is the so called @xmath0 gravity , which is represented by a function of the scalar torsion @xmath1 as lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 theories picks up preferred referential frames which constitute the autoparallel curves of the given manifold .",
    "a genuine advantage of @xmath0 gravity compared with other deformed gravitational schemes is that the differential equations for the vielbein components are second order differential equations .",
    "however , the effects of the additional degrees of freedom that certainly exist in @xmath0 theories is a consequence of breaking the local lorentz invariance that these theories exhibit . despite this",
    ", it was found that on the flat frw background with a scalar field , up to second order linear perturbations does not reveal any extra degree of freedom at all @xcite . as such",
    ", it is fair to say that the nature of these additional degrees of freedom remains unknown .",
    "remarkably , it is possible to modify @xmath0 theory in order to make it manifestly lorentz invariant .",
    "however , it will generically have different dynamics and will reduce to @xmath0 gravity in some local lorentz frames @xcite . clearly , in extending this geometry sector , one of the goals is to solve the puzzle of dark energy and dark matter without asking for new material ingredients that have not yet been detected by experiments @xcite .",
    "for instance , a born - infeld @xmath0 gravity lagrangian was used to address the physically inadmissible divergencies occurring in the standard cosmological big bang model , rendering the spacetime geodesically complete and powering an inflationary stage without the introduction of an inflaton field @xcite .",
    "also , it is believed that @xmath0 gravity could be a reliable approach to address the shortcomings of general relativity at high energy scales @xcite . furthermore",
    ", both inflation and the dark energy dominated stage can be realized in kaluza - klein and randall - sundrum models , respectively @xcite . in this way , @xmath0 gravity has gained attention and has been proven to exhibit interesting cosmological implications . on the other hand ,",
    "the search for black hole solutions in @xmath0 gravity is not a trivial problem , and there are only few exact solutions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is possible to construct other generalizations , as teleparallel equivalent of gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , kaluza - klein theory for teleparallel gravity @xcite and scalar - torsion gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a brief review of three - dimensional teleparallel gravity .",
    "then , in section iii we find asymptotically ads black holes with scalar hair , and we conclude in section iv with final remarks .",
    "in 1928 , einstein proposed the idea of teleparallelism to unify gravity and electromagnetism into a unified field theory ; this corresponds to an equivalent formulation of general relativity ( gr ) , nowadays known as teleparallel equivalent to general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite , where the weitzenbck connection is used to define the covariant derivative ( instead of the levi - civita connection which is used to define the covariant derivative in the context of gr ) .",
    "the first investigations on teleparallel 3d gravity were performed by kawai almost twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "the weitzenbck connection mentioned above has not null torsion .",
    "however , it is curvatureless , which implies that this formulation of gravity exhibits only torsion .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath1 is constructed from the torsion tensor .",
    "to clarify , the torsion scalar @xmath1 is the result of a very specific quadratic combination of irreducible representations of the torsion tensor under the lorentz group @xmath2 @xcite . in this way",
    ", the torsion tensor in tegr includes all the information concerning the gravitational field .",
    "the theory is called `` teleparallel equivalent to general relativity '' since the field equations are exactly the same as those of gr for every geometry choice .",
    "the lagrangian of teleparallel 3d gravity corresponds to the more general quadratic lagrangian for torsion , under the assumption of zero spin - connection .",
    "so , the action can be written as @xcite @xmath3where @xmath4 is the three - dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath5 are parameters , and @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the vielbein , @xmath9 is the exterior derivative , @xmath10 denotes the hodge dual operator and @xmath11 the wedge product .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 represents the cosmological constant term .",
    "moreover , since @xmath13 can be written completely in terms of @xmath14 , in the following we set @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "action ( [ action2 ] ) can be written in a more convenient form as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the torsion scalar @xmath1 is given by @xmath18~.\\ ] ] expanding this expression in terms of its components , the torsion scalar yields @xmath19 note that for tegr @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a variation of action ( [ actiontele0 ] ) with respect to the vielbein provides the following field equations : @xmath23 \\right.\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ + \\rho _ { 2}\\left\\{-2e_{a}\\wedge d\\star ( de^{b}\\wedge e_{b } ) + 2de_{a}\\wedge \\star ( de^{b}\\wedge e_{b})+i_{a}\\left[de^{c}\\wedge e_{c}\\wedge \\star ( de^{b}\\wedge e_{b})\\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\left . -2i_{a}(de^{b})\\wedge e_{b}\\wedge \\star ( de^{c}\\wedge e_{c})\\right\\ }   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ + \\rho_{4}\\left\\{-2e_{b}\\wedge d\\star ( e_{a}\\wedge de^{b})+2de_{b}\\wedge \\star ( e_{a}\\wedge de^{b})+i_{a}\\left[e_{c}\\wedge de^{b}\\wedge \\star ( de^{c}\\wedge e_{b})\\right]\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\left.\\left .   -2i_{a}(de^{b})\\wedge e_{c}\\wedge \\star ( de^{c}\\wedge e_{b})\\right\\}\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\left . \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",

    "finally , note that the torsion scalar can be calculated , leading to the constant value @xmath33 which is the cosmological constant as the sole source of torsion .",
    "in this section we will extend the above discussion considering a scalar field @xmath34 non - minimally coupled with the torsion scalar with a self - interacting potential @xmath35 , and then we will find hairy black hole solutions .",
    "so , the action can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath1 is given by ( [ scalartorsion ] ) and @xmath37 is the non - minimal coupling parameter .",

    "in contrast , in the extension of a non - minimally coupled scalar field with the torsion scalar , the theory is not local lorentz invariant , therefore , one could have in general a more complicated relation connecting the vielbein with the metric , with the vielbeins being non - diagonal even for a diagonal metric @xcite .",
    "however , for the three - dimensional solutions considered here , using a preferred diagonal frame is allowed , in the sense that this frame defines a global set of basis covering the whole tangent bundle , i.e. , they parallelize the spacetime @xcite , @xcite .    in the following , and in order to solve the above system of equations , we will consider two cases : first , we analyze the case @xmath46 , and then we analyze the more general case @xmath47 .      in this case the field equations ( [ q1])-([q4 ] ) simplify to @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 now , by adding equations ( [ fieldequation1 ] ) and ( [ fieldequation2 ] ) we obtain @xmath52 therefore , the nontrivial solution for the scalar field is given by @xmath53 and by using this profile for the scalar field in the remaining equations , we obtain the solution @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are integration constant and @xmath59 is the gauss hypergeometric function . in the limits",
