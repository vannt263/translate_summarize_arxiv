    "many years ago , superconductivity was discovered in heavy - fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the superconductivity was due to collective electronic fluctuations and not due to electron - phonon interactions .",
    "transport properties in the superconducting state were analyzed @xcite to show that superconductivity was in the d - wave symmetry .",
    "it was also suggested that the d - wave symmetry is promoted by antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite with long enough correlation lengths .",
    "this promotes scattering of fermions near the fermi - surface predominantly through angles around @xmath2 , which is essential for superconducting instability in the `` d - wave '' channel for a suitable fermi - surface @xcite .",
    "the idea of long enough afm correlation lengths as essential for this mechanism is supported by the fact that in heavy - fermions , superconductivity occurs generally in the regime near the afm quantum critical point where the correlation lengths are long but the competing afm phase has lower condensation energy .    at the same time",
    ", random phase approximation on the hubbard model was used to calculate the spin - fluctuation spectra and to suggest that d - wave superconductivity is promoted by such fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the properties of the hubbard model have proven controversial in more elaborate calculations ; there are calculations which suggest that the ratio of the transition temperature @xmath0 to the typical electronic kinetic energy parameters @xmath3 is more than @xmath4 @xcite to less than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "since heavy - fermion properties require kondo effect of the f - orbital local moments and their magnetic interactions using the wide - band electrons , a multi - orbital model is obviously required @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model was proposed as a sufficient model for the cuprate compounds @xcite .",
    "but the discovery in under - doped cuprates @xcite of the predicted time - reversal breaking order parameter @xcite on the basis of a multi - orbital model raises doubts on the validity of the hubbard model for the cuprates . for pnictides ,",
    "generalization of the hubbard model to multi - orbital situations and inclusions of hund s rule couplings appears essential .",
    "we have a more modest goal in this paper than calculating spin - fluctuations from microscopic theory and using it to calculate properties of the superconductor . in recent years inelastic neutron scattering in the heavy fermion compounds cecu@xmath6si@xmath6 @xcite and ceirin@xmath7 @xcite have provided details of the afm fluctuation spectrum in the normal state . the primary aim of this paper is to estimate the superconducting transition temperature using the parameters provided by the experiments in these compounds .",
    "to do so , we solve the eliashberg equations for d - wave superconductivity using a phenomenological afm spectral function with which the experimental data is in good accord .",
    "the use of the eliashberg equations for quantitative calculations may be open to question because the migdal expansion parameter , which is of @xmath4 for the electron - phonon problem is of @xmath8 for such compounds if one assumes that the scale of the afm fluctuations extends to the order of the electronic bandwidth .",
    "however , when the afm correlation length @xmath9 is large compared to the lattice constant @xmath10 or @xmath11 , the scale of the afm fluctuations is reduced correspondingly to @xmath12 . but",
    "in the limit of large correlation lengths , new questions arise @xcite which are not important in the electron - phonon problem .",
    "the most prominent among them are the role of inelastic scattering in depressing @xmath0 on the one hand @xcite , and the fact that the bcs type coupling constant @xmath13 appears to diverge when the characteristic fluctuation frequency @xmath14 and the bcs prefactor appears to go to @xmath15 .",
    "an answer to these questions and various considerations which determine @xmath0 from afm interactions is possible from the numerical solution of the eliashberg equations .",
    "we find that it is reasonable to conclude from a comparison of the calculated @xmath0 with experiments that afm fluctuations are responsible for d - wave superconductivity in the heavy fermion compounds . very importantly , with similar parameters we calculate the _ measured _",
    "coefficient of the anomalous @xmath1 contribution to the resistivity in these compounds .",
    "a claim to quantitative accuracy on both these quantities can however be made only to factors of @xmath16 .",
    "we note here that if one adopts that the dimensionless measure @xmath17 for how high is the electronic fluctuation induced superconducting , the heavy fermions may be said to do very well indeed .",
    "for example , in many cases , including the compounds studies here , this ratio is @xmath4 , similar to that of the cuprates .    following the proposals that afm fluctuations may also promote superconductivity in the cuprate compounds @xcite ,",
    "there have been many discussions of the mechanism and many calculations based on the eliashberg equations .",
    "a partial list includes the following @xcite .",
    "the most complete of these calculations appear to us to be those carried out by monthoux and lonzarich ( ml ) @xcite , both for 2 and 3 dimensional models .",
    "we present below calculations for the 2 dimensional square lattice model with a phenomenological spin - fluctuation spectrum , whose results are no different from those of ml for the range of parameters examined that are common .",
    "a difference in the calculations is that we vary the parameters in the two dimensional model so that `` nesting '' at the afm wave - vector quantitatively changes .",
    "the amount of nesting does have a significant effect on the results .",
    "more important is that now that the afm fluctuation spectra is available , we can use the experimental parameters to test the ideas quantitatively .",
    "we also discuss how to put limits on the parameters used based on sum - rule for the fluctuation spectra and show that they are inter - related .",
    "results for the range of physical parameters that we find relevant for the heavy fermions is not available in the published results of ml .",
    "this has bearing also on general conditions to determine the extent to which afm fluctuations give significant @xmath0 for relevant parameters in other compounds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we present in sec .",
    "( ii ) the models for fermi - surface and for the spin - fluctuations which we have investigated using the linearized eliashberg equations .",
    "we discuss there the change of effective coupling constants with the afm correlation length using sum - rules so that the results for numerical solutions of the eliashberg equations presented later are presaged .",
    "we present the results of the calculations in sec .",
    "( iii ) and discuss the important conclusions immediately after the description of the models .",
    "we also present , in an appendix , the explicit derivation of the coefficient of the @xmath18 resistivity from the measured form of the afm critical fluctuation spectra .",
    "this is used in the text to estimate independently the value of a coefficient @xmath13 , which is important for the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "we give the parameters that have been deduced by inelastic neutron scattering for the heavy fermion compounds cecu@xmath6si@xmath6 @xcite and ceirin@xmath7 @xcite and compare the measured @xmath0 with the calculations .",
    "we should emphasize that such a comparison is meant to be only illustrative of the physical principles involved ; no detailed quantitative agreement is to be expected , especially given that the electronic structure of these compounds is far more complicated than assumed in the models studied . however , enough details can be provided so that one can conclude that the idea of afm fluctuations near the quantum critical point in these compounds as the source of d - wave superconductivity is well supported .",
    "for example using measured properties , different levels of assumed nesting in the band - structure need a coupling constant @xmath13 between 1.5 and 3 to get the measured @xmath0 . in this range of @xmath13 and for the measured afm correlation length",
    "@xmath0 is close to being linear in @xmath13 .",
    "this range of values is compared with the value of @xmath19 needed to get the measured coefficient of the @xmath18 resistivity , which is relatively insensitive to nesting .",
    "one can assess the results from the fact that in the range of @xmath13 deduced , @xmath20 is found to be approximately linear in @xmath13 .",
    "in our calculations we will consider two types of fermi - surfaces , a free electron fermi - surface and the others given by the tight binding spectrum in a two dimensional square lattice with nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath3 and @xmath21 respectively : @xmath22 the fermi - surface with the tight binding spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] for four values of the next nearest hopping @xmath23 and the afm wave - vector .",
    "the nesting in the model changes as @xmath21 increases .",
    "we will show detailed result for three fermi - surfaces , the free electron fermi - surface , the fermi surface ( fs1 ) with tight binding spectrum with @xmath24 and the fermi surface ( fs2 ) with tight binding spectrum with @xmath25 .",
    "of the four fermi - surfaces shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , the one with @xmath24 has the worst nesting and the one with @xmath25 has the best nesting .",
    "[ fig:02 ] shows the circular fermi - surface , fs1 , fs2 and the corresponding afm wave - vectors .",
    "we will discuss using the results of ml together with ours , that if properly normalized density of states and fluctuation spectra are used , two dimensional and three dimensional models give similar results for @xmath0 provided one adjusts the ratio of the region of fermi - surface nesting to the total fermi - surface .",
    "this is in general is always lower in three than in two dimensions .",
    "it is also important to note , as discovered long ago @xcite , @xcite for the case of s - wave superconductors that @xmath20 is a rather gross quantity which depends to a very good approximation on the average density of states near the chemical potential only and not on details such as the number of fermi - surface sheets and shapes . for d - wave superconductors",
    ", we we show below , it is important to also include effects of nesting of the fermi - surface near the afm wave - vectors .      the dynamical spin - susceptibility for itinerant fermions with afm correlations may be usefully divided into two parts : the normal contribution of non - interacting fermions @xmath26 and the part @xmath27 affected by afm correlations .",
    "the two together obey the total magnetic moment sum - rule .",
    "the non - interacting susceptibility can play only an insignificant role in promoting superconductivity @xcite and should be ignored .",
    "the two contributions to the susceptibility can be distinguished by their momentum dependence .",
    "the characteristic momentum dependence of the non - interacting spin fluctuations is on a scale of @xmath28 while that of the afm spin - fluctuations is much shorter .",
    "a partial sum - rule on @xmath27 in terms of the ordered moment in the afm phase can be used to relate the integrated fluctuations to the afm correlation length .",
    "double counting by using the sum - rule on the total susceptibility for the fluctuations and yet having ( free ) fermions interacting with such spin - fluctuations is incorrect as it over - counts the total degrees of freedom .",
    "such considerations have usually been blithely ignored in most of the previous phenomenological work on this problem .",
    "the fermions interact with spin - fluctuations with a phenomenological action @xmath29 @xmath30 will be chosen to have dimensions of inverse of energy ( after subsuming a factor of @xmath31 in its definition ) .",
    "so @xmath32 is a coupling function of dimension of energy .",
    "@xmath32 for heavy fermions is the exchange energy between the conduction electrons and the @xmath33- local moments .",
    "its meaning for d - band problems is more ambiguous , and may be best inferred from independent experiments , for example the resistivity above @xmath20 .",

    "the correlation length @xmath9 is related to the deviation from the quantum critical point ( qcp ) by variation in pressure , doping , magnetic field , etc .",
    "as well as by temperature .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath37 and @xmath9 may all be determined from experiments .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath9 has been studied by renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite and by the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) methods @xcite . @xmath38 near afm qcp in the 3 dimensions and dynamical critical exponent @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath9 will be assumed to be of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the asymptotic @xmath43 value of the correlation length .",
    "one of our results is that the temperature dependence of @xmath9 is of insignificant consequence in determining @xmath0 .",
    "the linearized elisahberg equations give that the kernel for cooper pair coupling in the d - wave channel in a square lattice is proportional to the projection of @xmath44 to @xmath45 . in spin - fluctuations theories",
    ", @xmath46 has only a smooth momentum dependence .",
    "so , cooper - pair coupling prominently depends depends only on ( i ) the momentum dependence of @xmath47 determined by the correlation length @xmath9 ( ii ) the integrated weight in the momentum dependent part and ( iii ) the energy scale of the momentum dependent fluctuations .",
    "the first is qualitatively obvious from the fact that a q - independent spin - fluctuation contributes zero to the cooper channel in the d - wave channel .",
    "it is not possible to make quantitative statements on these effects without detailed calculations because the results also depend on the nesting in the band - structure near the afm @xmath37 .",
    "we will show that the three ingredients in @xmath47 are not mutually independent .    to gain physical insight ,",

    "actually , spin fluctuation are actually quite suppressed for @xmath52 and we can simply use @xmath53 in calculations of eliashberg equations .",
    "it is important to take into account that there are four equivalent afm - vector for the two dimensional problem in the paramagnetic regime of the model , however strongly fluctuating it may be .",
    "this has been taken into account in the sum - rule by multiplying the measured im@xmath54 by 4 . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the number of equivalent afm vectors is larger and a correspondingly larger multiplicative factor should be used .    in the regime of very long correlation lengths , @xmath56 , i.e. close to the quantum - critical point",

    "we may define an effective coupling constant @xmath67 to incorporate the effect of the correlation length . using that the sum - rule becomes the total moment sum - rule in the limit of infinite correlation length and the maximum possible ordered moment , i.e. that of the afm insulator ( ignoring the zero - point effects )",

    "@xmath13 values from about 5 to about 50 are used in the calculations with varying correlation lengths . actually , one obtains for the considerations of the sum - rules above that for spin-(1/2 ) problems , even the coupling constant @xmath69 is only of @xmath8 , because @xmath71 is of @xmath8 and so is the upper limit on the ratio @xmath62 .",
    "an independent estimate of @xmath67 may be obtained from the normal state properties , for example the coefficient of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of non - fermi - liquid form in the quantum critical region .",
    "again only @xmath13 of @xmath8 will be found consistent .",
    "it is also important to note that these bcs type coupling constants do not carry information on the retardation effects due to the frequency dependence of the interaction ; these as well as the effects of inelastic scattering which are particularly important for anisotropic superconductors are properly treated through the numerical solution of the eliashberg equations .",
    "the difference from electron - phonon induced superconductivity where a single parameter @xmath13 need by introduced @xcite should also be noted .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in some heavy fermions , the quantum - critical fluctuations do not have the functional form given by the simple rg or scr approximations as above , but displays `` local criticality '' @xcite as suggested for the cuprates @xcite . in this paper , we only consider fluctuations which are well specified by the form given above .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity near the quantum - critical points has been derived several times @xcite . here , we rederive it paying special attention to the coefficient in front of the anomalous temperature dependent part .",

    "this assumes that the _ actual _ electronic structure near the chemical potential is sufficiently complicated that in the temperature region of interest , vertex corrections which lead to emphasis on large momentum scattering for resistivity are unimportant . in that case the scattering rate which determines the resistivity is the same as the single - particle scattering rate averaged over the fermi - surface .",
