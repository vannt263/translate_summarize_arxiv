    "the description of the movement of a three - phase contact line is an essentially unsolved hydrodynamical problem that continues to attract much interest , for instance , when studying spreading drops , and liquid sheets or ridges moving down an inclined plate .",
    "the understanding of simple contact line movement is also paramount for a deeper insight in related problems as the dynamical wetting transition and transversal instabilities of moving contact lines .",
    "it is well known that the divergent shear stress at the contact line forbids a solution in the framework of purely classical hydrodynamics , i.e.  assuming a no - slip boundary condition at the solid - liquid interface .",
    "although this was first pointed out by huh and scriven @xcite based on moffatt s @xcite solution for flow in the edge which does not satisfy the normal stress boundary condition on a free interface , and was never proven rigorously , the divergence can be understood as a consequence of incompatibility of multivaluedness of the velocity at the contact point in the classical hydrodynamic formulation .",
    "the boundary condition has to be relaxed to permit movement of the contact line .",
    "this can be done by introducing a very thin precursor film on the dry substrate @xcite , or by allowing for slip at the solid - liquid interface everywhere @xcite or only near the contact line @xcite , or introducing an effective molecular interaction between the substrate and liquid into the hydrodynamic model @xcite . for a discussion of the slip condition see also the review by dussan @xcite .",
    "other approaches include phase changes at the contact line @xcite or introduce the vapour - liquid or fluid - solid interface , or both , as separate phases with properties that differ from the bulk fluid @xcite .",
    "most of the work on moving liquid sheets and ridges prescribes a precursor film or slip at the substrate .",
    "divergence problems at the contact line are avoided , but at the expense of introducing ad hoc parameters into the theory . these , namely the slip length or the precursor film thickness , influence the profile of ridges and fronts and hence also the characteristics of the transverse instability @xcite .",
    "the most realistic option is the explicit introduction of molecular interactions into the hydrodynamic formalism .",
    "this is accomplished by means of an additional pressure term , the disjoining pressure  @xcite .",
    "depending on the particular problem treated , this disjoining pressure may incorporate long - range van der waals and/or various types of short - range interaction terms  @xcite .",
    "recently pismen @xcite derived a film thickness equation with a disjoining pressure term by combining the long wave approximation for thin films @xcite with a nonlocal diffuse interface description for the liquid - gas interface that incorporates van der waals interactions .",
    "these interactions are essential for the process of dewetting , and studies of dewetting of a thin liquid film on a substrate are generally based on models involving a disjoining pressure @xcite .",
    "only a few studies of instabilities of liquid fronts have adopted a similar approach @xcite , despite the fact that such an approach _ predicts _ all the ad hoc parameters of the slip or precursor models ( i.e. , the static and dynamic contact angle , drop velocity , and the drop and precursor film thickness ) connected with the wetting properties of the liquid in terms of the parameters characterizing the disjoining pressure .",
    "recently , eggers presented asymptotic solutions for the profile of advancing @xcite and receding @xcite driven contact lines ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the respective solutions match inner solutions near the contact line where a slip model is used and outer solutions based on an analytic solution in terms of airy functions discussed in refs .. however , the advancing and receding case are studied for a plate pushed into and pulled out of a liquid bath , respectively .",
    "it is not possible to directly couple the two asymptotic solutions to describe the motion of a driven moving droplet or ridge .    in the present work",
    "we tackle the problem of an asymptotic description of a gradient - driven moving droplet that encompasses both an advancing and a receding contact line .",
    "this implies that the description of the two contact lines and the respective matching procedures depend on each other .",
    "thereby we explicitly introduce the molecular interactions into the hydrodynamic formalism by using a chemical potential or disjoining pressure describing a situation of partial wetting .",
    "this corresponds to a precursor film model where the precursor film thickness is determined through the disjoining pressure .",
    "we distinguish among three regions :    * _ microscopic _ ( molecular scale ) region : the dominant balance is between disjoining potential and surface tension . *",
    "_ mesoscopic _ region : the dominant balance is between viscous dissipation and surface tension . * _ macroscopic _ region : the dominant balance is between surface tension and external forces    examples for driving forces are gravity for droplets or fronts on inclined plates , marangoni forces occurring if temperature gradients along the substrate exist or wettability gradients along the substrate . both , gravity and marangoni forces act in the lubrication limit as bulk forces , i.e.  the force is fed into the system in a top - down manner .",
    "this implies that the macroscopic region has to be included in the description .",
    "however , the third mentioned way to drive the system is based on a force resulting from a wettability gradient that is fed into the system in a bottom - up manner , i.e.  on the microscale .",
    "the simplest description of such a system is undertaken here by matching solutions obtained in the mesoscopic and microscopic region .",
    "if the droplets are small enough ( smaller than the capillary length ) the macroscopic scale can be ignored .",
    "there are different physical situations where a gradient in wettability occurs that can be mapped onto the presently studied model .",
    "( i ) a droplet can sit on a step in wettability @xcite allowing for an intermittent range of stationary movement until the complete drop sits on the more wettable substrate .",
    "( ii ) a droplet can move along a smooth wettability gradient @xcite .",
    "( iii ) in a situation involving an adsorption reaction at the substrate underneath the droplet a droplet can produce the wettability gradient that drives its movement @xcite . in this way it carries the gradient along with its movement .",
    "the latter case is also related to droplet motion caused by a surface phase transitions @xcite .    in the following",
    "we study all these situations in a model that uses a chemical potential with different constants at the advancing and the receding contact line , respectively . for situations ( ii ) and ( iii ) this corresponds to the assumption that the wettability gradient is small as compared to the size of the contact zone but sizable as compared to the overall droplet size .    in the next section",
    "the basic equations for the lubrication description of moving droplets are introduced . the exact solution in the mesoscopic region and its asymptotics",
    "are described in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "the microscopic solution and its asymptotic matching are discussed in section  [ s2 ] .",
