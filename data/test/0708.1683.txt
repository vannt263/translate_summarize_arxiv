    "photons are possible .",
    "the universe in effect becomes opaque over mpc scales . to check",
    "the existence of this cut - off is therefore an important motivation for cosmic ray experiments like auger @xcite and hires @xcite . complementing the cosmic ray experiments , a number of experiments perform direct searches for ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos from the gzk pion decays ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the search for neutrinos above the gzk energy is also motivated in the context of grand unification theories ( gut ) @xcite .",
    "relic x-particles with ultra high mass @xmath4  ev originating from the gut phase - transition in the early universe could be decaying in the present epoch .",
    "thereby they would produce uhe neutrinos .",
    "as a final example of a theoretically very appealing possibility , is the z - burst process @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the highest energy cosmic rays are produced following resonant interactions ( @xmath5 ) of uhe neutrinos on the relic neutrino background .",
    "to explain the full cosmic ray spectrum , this would require a very high flux of neutrinos in the @xmath6 regime to be present .",
    "limits constraining the possible uhe !",
    "neutrino flux from these processes exist , with the most stringent one to date being presented by the anita - lite experiment @xcite .    among the various methods for detecting ultra high energy ( uhe ) particles , a promising technique utilizes the askaryan effect @xcite .",
    "this effect causes electromagnetic cascades , induced by the uhe particle interactions in dense media , to develop a negative charge excess .",
    "the charge excess will radiate coherently at radio wavelengths , thereby producing strong coherent pulses of erenkov radiation . in a series of accelerator experiments , the askaryan mechanism has been confirmed to work in different media .",
    "most important for our purposes , it was tested in silica sand specifically to mimic the conditions of the lunar material @xcite .",
    "it was first proposed by askaryan @xcite , later by dagkesamanskii and zheleznyk @xcite , that the radio transparent lunar regolith ( the 10 - 20 m deep surface layer of the moon , consisting mainly of fractured rock ) would be an ideal target for studying such uhe particles .",
    "an additional advantage is the absence of an atmosphere which implies that electromagnetic showers in the lunar regolith are caused by the primary cosmic particles .",
    "a number of attempts at observing cosmic ray induced radio waves from the moon have since been carried out using ground based radio telescopes . the first experiment @xcite used the 64 m diameter parkes radio telescope in australia to make coincidence measurements from two polarization channels . a 500-mhz band centered at 1.425 ghz",
    "was used after making appropriate corrections for the ionospheric delay between two sub - bands .",
    "the second was the goldstone lunar ultra - high energy neutrino experiment ( glue ) @xcite that used two large telescopes of the jpl / nasa deep space network in goldstone ( ca ) .",
    "a third experiment of this kind took place at kalyazin radio astronomical observatory , using again a single 64 m radio telescope @xcite .",
    "none of these experiments however , resulted in any detection of signals from uhe particles . under the name numoon ,",
    "there is one currently on - going search using the westerbrok synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the netherlands @xcite . for future experiments with increased sensitivity",
    "there are proposals @xcite to study this effect with upcoming radio telescopes like the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the square kilometer array ( ska ) , or to use lunar orbiting artificial satellites carrying one or more radio antennas @xcite .    in this paper we study in detail the possibility of detection of uhecr and neutrino radio waves from the moon with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) facility @xcite .",
    "the gmrt comprises @xmath7 fully steerable dishes spread over distances up to @xmath8 km , each with a diameter of @xmath9 m. half of these antennas are distributed randomly over about @xmath10 km@xmath11 in a compact array while the rest are spread out in an approximate `` y '' configuration .",
    "the gmrt currently operates in eight frequency bands around @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16-@xmath17 mhz .",
    "the shortest baseline is @xmath18 m while the longest one is @xmath19 km .",
    "the telescope has an effective area in total of @xmath20 m@xmath11 for frequencies up to @xmath21 mhz and @xmath22 m@xmath11 at the higher frequencies .",
    "the rms sensitivity of the gmrt , using a @xmath23 s integration time and a bandwidth of @xmath24 mhz is @xmath25 mjy and @xmath26 mjy at @xmath21 mhz and @xmath27 ghz respectively . with such high sensitivity",
    ", we expect a substantial improvement from previous experiments in the measurement of the askaryan radio waves from the moon .",

    "we also show the commonly used gaussian approximation where the forward - suppression factor @xmath51 in ( [ f ] ) is ignored",
    ". for high frequencies this has no effect . for low frequencies , the differences at small angles only plays a role for showers nearly parallel to the surface normal , while the effects of changing the normalization near the erenkov angle is important also for more horizontal showers .",
    "a measure of the effective angular spread @xmath52 of the emission around the erenkov angle @xmath53 is given in terms of @xmath54 for the example in fig .",
    "[ radioflux1 ] this becomes @xmath55 .",
    "the erenkov radio waves are expected to be @xmath56 linearly polarized @xcite .",
    "radio signals should therefore be observed with both the lcp and rcp modes . a simultaneous triggering of both the lcp and rcp modes ( with @xmath57 of the total intensity in each mode ) will be a good signature of the transient erenkov radio wave emission from uhe particles .",
    "in addition , the large number of gmrt dishes should allow pointing discrimination and spatial - temporal coincidence measurements to be used for signal identification and background rejection .",
    "for cosmic rays , which produce showers by hadronic processes , the shower energy @xmath28 is equal to the energy of the primary particle .",
    "when instead the showers are produced by deep inelastic neutrino scattering off target nucleons , the fraction of the total energy which produces the hadronic showers is , on average , @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "the radio waves are also absorbed in the regolith , which we take to have a frequency dependent attenuation length @xmath62 m @xcite .",
    "this means the attenuation length of radio waves is always much smaller than the mean free path of the neutrinos , conveniently parameterized as @xmath63 km using the cross sections of @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from this expression , the mean free path for an uhe neutrino is not sufficient to escape the moon .",
    "most of the passing neutrinos will therefore interact in the material .",
    "the threshold energy required for showers to be detectable is determined by the sensitivity of the radio telescope .",

    "we will differentiate between neutrinos , which have a large mean free path and therefore can penetrate the interior of the moon before producing the erenkov radio waves , and the strongly interacting cosmic rays ( referred to by the subscript @xmath112 ) which can penetrate only small distances below the surface of the moon .",
