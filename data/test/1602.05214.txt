    "growing risk of terrorism demands a constant development of new techniques for hazardous substances detection .",
    "one of the best methods for homeland security are based on the neutron activation analysis ( naa ) providing non - intrusive detection of explosives or drugs .",
    "the principle of the method is to use a fast neutron beam produced using sealed d+t generator to excite nuclei of investigated substance and detect characteristic gamma quanta produced in de - excitation of the nuclei .",
    "this allows one to identify the stoichiometry of the substance and determine if it is dangereus  @xcite .",
    "so far there are several devices based on neutron activation analysis designed for ground homeland security which were introduced in the usa by science applications international corporation  @xcite and calsec  @xcite , and in europe in sodern  @xcite , euritrack  @xcite and swan  @xcite projects .",
    "these devices are used in the homeland security or contraband detection on the land .",
    "however , in an aquatic environment one encounters serious problems due to strong attenuation of neutrons in water .",
    "moreover , as in the case of ground detectors , an isotropic generation of neutrons induces a large environmental background .",
    "this noise can be significantly reduced by the requirement of the coincident detection of the alpha particles which are produced together with neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the attenuation of neutrons can be compensated by reducing the distance between generator and examined item  @xcite .",
    "there are also solutions based on low energy neutrons which are moderated in water before reaching the tested object .",
    "the detector is then counting the gamma quanta from thermal neutron capture and secondary neutrons originating from the irradiated object .",
    "the identification is done by searching for anomalies in the observed spectra of gamma quanta and neutrons  @xcite . however",
    ", these methods do not allow to detect explosives buried deeper in the bottom of the sea and strong attenuation of neutrons and gamma quanta significantly increases the exposure time .",
    "+ an alternative solution of a detector which uses naa technique and special guides for neutrons and emitted gamma rays was proposed within the sabat project  @xcite .",
    "the device allows for detection of dangerous substances hidden deep in the bottom of the sea with significantly reduced background and provides determination of the density distribution of the dangerous substance in the tested object  @xcite . in this article",
    "we present status of the design of the sabat detector based on monte carlo simulations , focusing on the impact of the usage of neutron and gamma quanta guides .",
    "in order to optimize the dimensions and relative positions of detectors and guides we have developed dedicated open source software package written in the c++ programming language  @xcite .",
    "this simulation tool is using novel methods of geometry definition and particle tracking and the open mpi library supporting parallel computing  @xcite . to define the geometry of simulated objects we use a polygon mesh , which is in the simplest form a collection of vertices and edges that are used to define a surface of the polyhedral 3d object . in our case",
    "the faces consist of triangles .",
    "trajectory of a particle traveling in a scene consisting of such defined objects is simulated with so - called ray tracing technique . to determine",
    "if a particle entered given object the mller - trumbore method was implemented which searches for intersection of the particle trajectory with the object surface ( triangle mesh ) .",
    "the total cross - sections and angular distributions of neutrons and @xmath0 rays interaction with selected nuclei were parametrized as a function of energy using data from the evaluated nuclear data file ( endf ) database  @xcite , while gamma quanta energies were taken from the evaluated nuclear structure data files ( ensdf )  @xcite .",

    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicates that the 4.4  mev carbon line is overwhelmed by background while we see clearly gamma quanta from carbon with energy of about 9.6  mev . in case of chlorine and sulfur ( lines of 6.5  mev and 2.2  mev , respectively )",
    "the oxygen background has to be significantly reduced to allow one to identify these elements more clearly .",
    "this can be done requiring of the coincident detection of the @xmath2 particle generated together with neutron or by covering all the detector faces not connected to the gamma quanta guide with thick layer of absorber .",
    "identification of sulfur and chlorine is difficult due to neutron capture on hydrogen giving lines of very close energy and chlorine content in the sea water  @xcite .",

    "in the framework of the sabat project we have been developing simulation package based on novel methods of geometry definition and particle tracking .",
    "although we are still in a very early stage of development the first results indicate that indeed , both the neutron guide and @xmath0 ray guide will increase the performance of underwater threats detection with fast neutrons  @xcite .",
    "with 1.4@xmath310@xmath4 generated neutrons we see enhancements of signal events in the detector together with huge background originating mostly from oxygen , as it was expected .",
    "this shows clearly that all the faces of the detector not connected to the guide should be covered with thick layer of material absorbing @xmath0 quanta and neutrons which constitute another big source of background .",
    "this noise can be also significantly reduced by the requirement of the coincident detection of the @xmath2 particle generated together with neutron , which allows for the neutron tagging  @xcite .",
    "as one of the possible way of the background suppression via time - of - flight method we consider an application of plastic scintillators in order to take advantage of their excellent timing properties , as recently demonstrated in case of low energy gamma quanta  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 particle detection and time measurement will be included as the next step in the development of the simulations .",
    "this will allow for a final design of the device for underwater threats detection with fast neutrons , which requires much bigger statistics generated .",
