    "the observed properties of galaxies can be attributed to a wide variety of complex factors . in order to understand the environmental causes that might trigger intense star - formation in the local universe , such as that observed at high redshifts for lyman break galaxies , we explore two regimes : large - scale , to study the connection between halo mass and high star formation rates ( sfrs ) ; and small scale , calculating merger rates . at large scales",
    ", a galaxy s sfr may be connected to how the galaxy accretes gas from its large - scale environment , which depends on the halo mass .",
    "smaller scale environmental effects , from nearby galaxies , may induce star formation from interactions and eventual mergers .",
    "the study of galaxy evolution has been connected to that of larger structure formation their growth related to overdensities arising from primordial density fluctuations .",
    "studies of galaxy bias , the distribution of galaxies relative to underlying dark matter distribution , attempt to describe the fate and origin of present - day galaxies .",
    "the link between halo mass and star formation has been discussed and explored in several papers @xcite .",
    "a simple description involves gas flowing to centers of dark matter potentials , reaching sufficient density to radiate and cool , losing pressure support and settling into a disk , and then forming stars .",
    "the system is eventually accreted onto a larger structure",
    ". such accretion by clusters can shock - heat the gas into high temperatures , preventing new stars from forming .",
    "therefore , we expect that active star formation can occur for halo masses whose virial temperatures are less than 10@xmath8k , where shock - heating inhibits new star formation .",
    "redshift evolution of the link between halo mass and star formation , determined by large scale environmental effects , might explain observations such as the butcher - oemler @xcite effect .",
    "in this effect , clusters at high redshifts host more blue , star - forming galaxies than local clusters , which are predominantly inhabited by `` red and dead '' galaxies .",
    "similarly , using the two - point angular correlation function to measure clustering strength , @xcite find that uv - selected , star - forming galaxies have migrated from cluster regions , with high correlation lengths ( r@xmath9 ) , at high redshift to more isolated regions at low redshifts . from the view of hierarchical structure formation ,",
    "higher redshift clusters have lower halo masses compared to low - z clusters , thus high - z clusters have virial temperatures low enough to allow star formation . adding to this framework , @xcite discuss the importance of hot vs. cold accretion  in the simplified picture above , gas does not get heated to the virial temperature necessarily .",
    "massive galaxies draw gas via quasi - spherical , `` hot mode '' accretion , in which the gas does shock - heat to the virial temperature .",
    "however , less massive galaxies acquire gas from flow along filaments in `` cold mode '' accretion where the gas radiates away its gravitational energy and never reaches the virial temperature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these simulations show that the large - scale galaxy environment influences gas accretion processes . therefore",
    ", a galaxy s halo mass contributes significantly to how it acquires gas , the fuel that affects its star formation efficiency .",
    "similar shock physics may affect the relation between small scale merger effects and star formation .",
    "@xcite predict that the merger of a halo with a larger structure , such as a cluster , suppresses star formation as gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the more massive halo and then cools onto the central object of the most massive halo .",
    "thus , these results suggest that the mass of the larger companion is a consideration for whether mergers might enhance star formation . according to the work of @xcite , mergers with clusters should not result in enhanced star formation .",
    "nevertheless , other studies show that at these small scales galaxy - galaxy interactions and close neighbors can stimulate star formation activity . in hierarchical structure formation",
    ", the merger process is an important ingredient for galaxy evolution . over thirty years ago",
    ", @xcite suggested that tidal forces during the merger process can funnel gas into the central regions of galaxies , triggering strong star formation activity .",
    "further theoretical studies have investigated the connection between mergers and high star formation rates ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that nearly half of the highest star - forming galaxies have close companions ( galaxies within a projected radius of 100 kpc ) , by correlating 10@xmath10 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . according to this research ,",
    "tidal interactions are the primary cause for enhanced star formation for these most active star - forming galaxies .",
    "several studies using various star formation indicators from h@xmath11 , co , far - infrared luminosities for interacting galaxies have shown that enhanced star formation results from galaxy interactions ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .    using the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _  ) , @xcite have uncovered a population of local , intensely star - forming galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are selected based on their fuv luminosities ( l@xmath12 @xmath13 2@xmath1410@xmath15 ) .",

    "we refer to these systems as lyman break analogs ( lbas ) , to discriminate this special subset of uvlgs from lower surface brightness uvlgs .",
    "given that lbgs are found at higher redshifts ( z@xmath182 - 3 ) where major and minor mergers are generally more prevalent than for z@xmath180.1 lbas , lbas and lbgs may be expected to differ in their recent merger histories , environments , and location within large scale structure .    in this paper",

    "see @xcite ) , we compare uvlg and lba samples , which draws from the combined cosmos+_galex _  data ( i@xmath025.5 , and nuv@xmath023 , see @xcite for more details ) , with three separate galaxy samples ( selected from the cosmos sample , with i@xmath025.5 ) for 0.4@xmath0z@xmath01.2 : ( 1 ) a volume limited sample in m@xmath25-``all '' , ( 2 ) blue luminous galaxies- `` blg '' , and ( 3 ) luminous red galaxies- `` lrg '' .",
    "we briefly note here  while the `` all '' sample is volume - limited in m@xmath25 , it is not volume - limited for all colors .",
    "this is discussed in more detail further below .",
    "figure 1 shows the various cuts applied to the data to create these separate samples : all is comprised of galaxies with -24@xmath26 - 18 ; blg galaxies have @xmath27 - 20.0 and @xmath28 1.8 color ; and lrg set is selected by a luminosity cut , @xmath29 - 20.5 and color cut , @xmath30 @xmath13 2.0 .",

    "our sample of lbas were determined by the criteria : i@xmath35 l@xmath36 kpc@xmath17 . while the i - band size may overestimate the uv size by a factor of 2 ( @xcite , thereby , underestimating the fuv surface brightness by a factor of 4 ) , we find that @xmath37% of uvlgs are lbas , consistent with what is found at z@xmath7 0.2 @xcite .",
    "we summarize the sample sizes for each redshift bin in table 1 , and show the redshift and spatial distributions of these samples in figures 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the `` l '' shape of the color - magnitude diagrams in figure 1 indicates that the red and blue galaxies do not populate the magnitude space in the same way .",
    "the majority of red galaxies tend to be more luminous than blue galaxies ; the faint end for the red galaxies starts decreasing around m@xmath38 - 19 .",
    "while the volume - limited cut shown on the upper left panel of figure 1 selects a complete sample in m@xmath39 , the color - magnitude diagram at m@xmath40 - 19 shows a diminishing sample of red galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) for red galaxies shows that the faint end does have a decreasing slope ( @xcite , but our lf comparison of the red galaxies in the all sample with the theoretical lf does indicate sample incompleteness at higher redshifts .",
    "this incompleteness does not affect either the blg or lrg samples which are selected to be sufficiently bright to avoid magnitude limits .",
    "however , the all magnitude cut of m@xmath38 - 18 suffers from some incompleteness in the red population .",
    "this observation is worth noting for interpreting and comparing the all sample to other samples and studies , but does not affect the overall conclusions of this paper .",
    "the predicted n(z ) , shown as a black dotted line in figure [ fig : zdist ] , is derived using the luminosity functions observed by @xcite for the all , blg and lrg samples and by @xcite for the uvlg sample ( this is discussed further in  [ sec : quant ] ) .",
    "the redshift distributions in figure 2 roughly follow the smooth predicted distribution marked by the black dotted line .",

    "given a uniform , poissonian distribution , @xmath53 , while correlated data ( @xmath54 ) means that there is an increased probability of finding a second galaxy within distance r of the first .",
    "various studies ( i.e. , @xcite for sdss galaxies and @xcite for high - z lbgs ) have found departures from a power - law with a single slope . rather , they find that the correlation function is better approximated by the sum of two contributions : the `` one - halo term '' , dominating at small scales for galaxy pairs residing within the same halo , and the `` two - halo term '' , dominating at large scales for galaxy pairs within separate haloes .",
    "this so - called hod modeling is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , to account for the fact that the galaxy correlation function might not follow a power law with a single slope , we assume that @xmath55 can be fit by two power laws with different slope for small scales and for large scales .    for data based on photometric redshifts ,",
    "the three dimensional correlation function can not be measured directly , but it can be inferred from the projected two - dimensional angular correlation function . by analogy of the steps outlined above ,",

    "assuming that a tight relationship between stellar mass and halo mass exists , based on observational `` abundance matching '' , they theoretically derive how mass assembly and star formation history evolve with time . based on averaged results ( they caution that exceptions to their results are completely plausible ) , @xcite determine that the relationship between star formation rate ( sfr ) and halo mass is gaussian - shaped , whose mean and normalization parameters evolve slightly with redshift . however",
    "the broadness of the sfr peak , spanning 11.9@xmath13513.1 for z@xmath70 , suggests that a distinct characteristic halo mass leading to higher sfrs does not exist .",

    "as discussed earlier , @xcite suggest two regimes of gas fueling and star formation efficiency , depending on halo mass : hot - mode accretion for massive galaxies and halos masses @xmath136 m@xmath36 which relate to lower sfrs , and cold - mode accretion in less massive galaxies , where gas is drawn along filamentary structure and able to feed star formation more efficiently . both of the results from @xcite and @xcite imply that the range of allowed halo masses for high sfrs could be broad with the possibility that there is some mixing of both hot- and cold- accretion modes for halos with masses , m@xmath137 .",
    "while the study by @xcite has been very thorough for z@xmath02 , they do allow that the situation might differ at higher redshifts . as illustrated by @xcite ,",

    "the uvlgs have halo masses that are consistent with these values . while the errors are admittedly too large to be conclusive , our result hints that the halo masses in extreme star - forming galaxies , such as lbgs and uvlgs , are consistent with masses @xmath139 .      at large scales , we measured halos masses of uvlgs , in an attempt to connect star formation properties with large scale processes ; at small scales another important environmental quantity is measured the likelihood for mergers .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that halos do not necessarily merge in the same way that galaxies merge .",
    "at small scales , the more relevant quantity is the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , or the way in which galaxies occupy their halos .",
    "this information constrains galaxy formation models at the @xmath32 100 kpc scales .    studying their small scale clustering",
    ", we find that uvlgs and lbas tend to have high pair fractions and merger rates with the all sample .",
    "images of the lbas offer similar clues , displaying companions or ongoing interactions ( such as tidal features and plumes ) in the high resolution images @xcite .",
    "consistent with the results found by @xcite , the most extreme star - forming galaxies are preferentially found in close pairs .",
    "studying lbgs at high redshifts ( z@xmath140 ) , @xcite also find evidence for small - scale clustering .",
    "they interpret that lbgs likely have fainter companions occupying the same halos , and find that the hod model fits their data well .",
    "using merger histories to connect z@xmath124 lbgs to present - day massive galaxies , @xcite argue that m@xmath141 galaxies undergo @xmath7 4 major mergers , with most of the interactions having occured before z@xmath181.5 .",
    "furthermore , they show that z@xmath180.5 galaxy with stellar mass @xmath142 likely originated as a 10@xmath143 galaxy , whose stellar mass has grown both by mergers and increased star formation activity . while the number of mergers plateaus for @xmath144 galaxies by z@xmath72 , less massive galaxies seem to continue merging until z@xmath180.5 .",
    "uvlgs have stellar masses @xmath145m@xmath36 , and lbas have lower masses ( @xmath146 m@xmath36 ) . if uvlgs follow the same merger histories and evolution as more general galaxies studied by @xcite , the present uvlg and lba masses suggest that their z@xmath124 predecessors had stellar masses between @xmath147 m@xmath36 and are probably still actively merging at z@xmath148",
    ".    could mergers be the main triggers for the increased star formation in these low dust , high star - forming galaxies ?",
    "our results , and more generally , the conclusion reached by @xcite find that interactions and mergers do lead to enhanced star formation . as discussed in the introduction , this concept is not new  having theoretical roots from @xcite , mergers efficiently funnel gas into central regions of galaxies , providing fodder for star formation .",
    "this theory is supported by several observational studies ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we can also reverse the query : do all mergers and interactions create uvlgs or lbgs ? mergers and interactions do enhance star formation , but these processes are also seen in lirgs and ulirgs  which are dustier systems , apparently different from uvlgs and lbas .",
    "the overlap between these ir star - forming populations and uv - star - forming galaxies has not been studied in detail .",
    "we speculate that both of these systems may be related , as different phases of the merger process with various unknown factors such as orientation , timescales , and kinematics adding complexity to the evolution and final merger state ; or , while some fraction of mergers result in uvlgs , some other fraction result in dustier lirgs or a separate class of galaxies , altogether .",
    "@xcite has found that a larger fraction of lirgs appear in the merger phase than in the pre - merger , close pair phase .",
    "so it is plausible that uvlgs relate to the earliest interaction phase , exhibiting high sfrs , low dust and distorted features .",
    "the highest restframe - uv surface brightnesses , observed in lbas , corresponds to galaxies found to have a higher incidence of pairs .",
    "unfortunately , further investigation about their environment is beyond the scope of this statistical study because of their rarity .",
    "extrapolating from our data on local lbg analogs , it seems that close pairs are one relevant ingredient to their condition .",
    "however , it is unlikely that every merger will result in a low dust , high surface brightness , high sfr galaxy  other ( unknown as yet ) constraints must also be placed in order to produce this particular breed of galaxy .",

    "the correlation function does not evolve with redshift .",

    "we assume that @xmath76 , which describes non - evolution in the correlation function .",
    "this assumption is justified by the study by @xcite  finding that r@xmath9 evolves by @xmath78 20% over z@xmath180.2@xmath11.2 range .",
    "the correlation function can be characterized by a power law at large scales , and a separate power law at small scales ( see @xcite ) .",
    "3.)the size of the redshift bins do not affect correlation results .",
    "bins that are too wide might make real - space correlations appear weaker by projecting across an excessively wide redshift range .",
    "however , we assume that dz@xmath180.4 is not too wide , and check this assumption by comparing to more narrow dz@xmath180.2 bins finding that there is good agreement between the wide and narrow cases .",
    "we find that uvlgs inhabit halos with masses exceeding @xmath149m@xmath36 .",
    "this result is further constrained by the additional observation that uvlgs and lrgs ( which typically trace the most massive halos ) do not often form pairs .",
    "rather , uvlgs form close pairs with higher probability compared to the all sample forming pairs with themselves ; and uvlgs pair with blgs with the same probability as blg - blg pairs . therefore we conclude that mergers are relevant environmental effects responsible for triggering high levels of sfr , observed in uvlgs and the high redshift lbgs .",
    "we are not able to definitively measure the halo mass of this sample given our large errors .",
    "however , we explore the possibility that halo mass may play some role in the uvlg or lbg condition since both examples of uv - selected , high sfr galaxies have halo masses consistent with @xmath150m@xmath36 .",
