    "this point of view is captured by imagining an energy landscape that is not fixed , but changes with time as we manipulate the forces @xmath42 .",
    "let us refer to these two alternatives as the ( i ) _ exclusive _ and the ( ii ) _ inclusive _ frameworks , according to whether the term @xmath44 is treated as a component of the internal energy of the system .",

    "[ eq : w ] provides a simple interpretation of the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
