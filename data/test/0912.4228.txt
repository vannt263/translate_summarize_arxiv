    "it is generally assumed that topological defects in liquid crystal membranes are excluded in the ground state because they increase the elastic free energy of the system to more than that in the defect - free equilibrium state .",
    "the situation is quite different when the liquid crystal phases are embedded in a curved surface . in a curved membrane with nonzero gaussian curvature",
    ", the appearance of topological defects can be favorable or even inevitable because of geometrical and/or topological constraints .",
    "a typical example is a disclination - containing equilibrium state in a nematic liquid crystal that is constrained in a spherical surface @xcite .",
    "the defect structure in such a nematic spherical shell has recently been reconsidered both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , and these investigations revealed richer physical properties than those that have initially been suggested .",
    "in addition to the nematic cases , the smectic phases of liquid crystal films @xcite and columnar phases of a block copolymer assembly @xcite have also exhibited an interplay between disclination structures and the geometry / topology of the constraint surface .",
    "in particular , smectic ordering on a sinusoidal substrate has indicated a direct coupling between the substrate curvature and the preferential locations of disclinations in equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "the coupling is purely a geometric curvature effect in the sense that the system involves no topological requirement for the existence of disclination .",
    "the geometric curvature also strongly influences the orientational order of the spin lattice models defined on curved surfaces @xcite .",
    "many intriguing results have been obtained with regard to the global lowest - energy state on a curved surface with a minimum number of disclinations , which should be relevant to liquid crystal phases at very low temperatures . in actual systems , however , a slight physical ( and chemical ) disturbance causes excess disclinations @xcite .",
    "these disclinations can travel over a surface via thermal excitation , and they flow almost freely if the disclination density is sufficiently low to ignore their interaction .",
    "the only possible force that restricts the free motion of the excess disclinations arises from a coupling between the surface curvature and the disclination energy .",
    "the substrate curvature breaks the translational symmetry of the molecular configuration in the vicinity of the disclination core , which may cause a shift in the disclination energy . as a result ,",
    "the energetically preferential positions of excess disclinations are believed to be tunable by imposing an appropriate curvature modulation .    in this article",
    ", we study the energies of disclinations in a nematic thin film assigned on a gaussian bump .",
    "it is found that disclinations with a @xmath0 charge prefer positioning at inflection points of the bump , implying the formation of a halo , i.e. , an annulus distribution of excess disclinations around the top of the bump .",
    "in addition , disclinations with a @xmath1 charge are found to exhibit double concentric halo structures , provided the bump height is relatively large .",
    "these halo formations are consequences of the non - trivial coupling between the disclination energies and the surface curvature modulation .",
    "schematic of a gaussian bump and mathematical notations used in the paper .",
    "the thick arc depicted on the bump is a projection of the thick line segment on the underlying flat plane . ]",
    "we consider nematic liquid crystals confined in a thin curved membrane with thickness @xmath2 , in which the molecules align parallel to the tangential directions independently of the depth in the membrane . in line with the continuum theory @xcite ,",
    "the elastic free energy of the molecular ensemble within the volume @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 where the unit vector @xmath5 ( called the director field ) describes the local molecular alignment .",
    "@xmath6 is a vector operator whose components @xmath7 are the covariant derivative @xcite on the curved surface . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the elastic constants associated with splay and bend distortions of the molecular configuration , respectively @xcite .",
    "suppose that the director lies within a thin curved shell having a gaussian bump geometry .",
    "points on the bump are represented by a three - dimensional vector @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are basis vectors of the cartesian coordinate system , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the polar coordinates assigned on the underlying flat plane ( see fig.[fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the geometric deviation of a bump from a flat plane is characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath17 that represents the ratio of the height to the width of the bump .",
    "note that the constant @xmath18 in the last term in eq.([eq : points ] ) determines the points of inflection of the gaussian bump , i.e. , across which the sign of @xmath19 changes .",
    "we demonstrate below that @xmath18 plays a prominent role in describing the correlation between the disclination energy and the substrate curvature .",
    "let us locate a disclination core on a point @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant without loss of generality .",
    "the disclination size is sufficiently smaller than the bump width , and the perimeter of the disclination is defined by the locus of points whose distances from the core are equal in the sense of geodesic distance ; therefore , the perimeter slightly deviates from a circular shape when it is placed on a curved surface , whereas it is an exact circle when placed on a flat plane .    for later use",
    ", we introduce a new polar coordinate system @xmath22 on the flat plane such that the coordinate origin ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) locates at the point of interaction of the flat plane and the vertical line penetrating the disclination core ( see fig.[fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "then , the basis vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 span the curved surface and allow us to write @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend on @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see appendix [ app : nnong ] ) . the director orientation around the core",

    "when @xmath37 , for instance , all @xmath38 contained within the disclination area @xmath39 make the same angle @xmath40 with respect to @xmath34 ( see fig.[fig : confdip](a ) ) ; on the other hand , when @xmath41 , the angle increases proportionally to @xmath31 ( see fig.[fig : confdim](a ) ) .    in the calculation , we consider disclinations with two charges , @xmath42 . the disclination area @xmath39 and the membrane thickness @xmath2",

    "the plot for @xmath54 exhibits a transition from a single downward peak structure ( @xmath55 ) into a double - well structure ( @xmath56 ) such that @xmath18 becomes unstable .",
    "the contrasting behaviors of @xmath46 for @xmath37 and @xmath1 are attributed to surface curvature effects on the director configuration close to the core , as will be shown in sec.[sec : discu ] . for paa and 5cb , we have obtained similar profiles of @xmath46 exhibiting a downward peak at @xmath52 for @xmath37 and a double - well structure for @xmath54 , whereas the peak heights differ slightly from those shown in fig.[fig : energyplot ] because of quantitative differences in @xmath8 and @xmath9 . we have also confirmed that the peak positions ( both downward and upward ) are independent of our choice of @xmath40 defined by eq.([eq : psi ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the energy scales of the potential wells shown in figs.[fig : confdip](a ) and [ fig : confdip](b ) exceed the thermal energy scale at ambient temperature .",
    "for instance , the depth of the single well for @xmath57 and @xmath58 given in fig.[fig : confdip](a ) is approximately @xmath59 ; this is of the order of @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "this fact suggests that the potential well at @xmath62 overwhelms the thermal excitation that causes a random movement of disclinations over the surface . as a result ,",
    "an ensemble of trapped disclinations forms a halo with radius @xmath47 around the top of the gaussian bump , provided that the disclination density is sufficiently low to ignore their repulsive interaction .",
    "the same scenario applies to disclinations with a charge of @xmath1 , implying the formation of doubly consentric halos observed for @xmath63 .     around the core of a disclination with a charge of @xmath64 .",

    "the physical origin of a downward peak in the plot of @xmath46 for @xmath37 ( see fig.[fig : energyplot](a ) ) is a curvature - induced shift in the director configuration around the disclination core .",
    "figures [ fig : confdip](a ) and [ fig : confdip](b ) illustrate how the configuration varies with a shift in the core position @xmath47 from @xmath65 ( a ) to @xmath52 ( b ) . in fig.[fig :",

    "this symmetry breaks down for @xmath71 . by",
    "increasing @xmath47 , the perimeter of the disclination distorts slightly and becomes elliptical , and then , the relationship @xmath70 no longer holds ( see fig.[fig : confdip](b ) ) , except along the four specific line segments ( @xmath72 ) . the most important observation in fig.[fig : confdip](b ) is a suppression of the splay deformation in the shadowed region .",
    "the area of the corresponding region is maximized at @xmath52 , as a result of which a downward peak @xmath46 arises at @xmath52 at the expense of a slight splay enhancement within a limited region around @xmath73 .",
    "parallel arguments to the preceding paragraph account for the double - well structure of @xmath46 for @xmath41 that is shown in fig.[fig : energyplot](b ) .",
    "figures [ fig : sketchv](a)(c ) show the variation of the @xmath38 configuration under @xmath54 and @xmath56 , each figure corresponding to the core position : @xmath65 ( a ) , @xmath74 ( b ) , and @xmath52 ( c ) .",
    "the director configuration in ( a ) exhibits a four - fold rotational symmetry that breaks down as @xmath47 increases .",
    "symmetry breaking induces a suppression of the splay deformation in the light - shadowed regions shown in fig.[fig : sketchv](b ) and [ fig : sketchv](c ) in a manner similar to the case of @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , the splay deformation in the dark - shadowed regions is enhanced with an increase in @xmath47 .",
    "these two competing effects result in the double - well structure of @xmath46 for @xmath41 cases .",
    "that is , @xmath46 decreases with @xmath47 when the suppression effect exceeds the enhancement , and it increases in the opposite situation .",
    "the degree of splay enhancement in the dark regions is maximized at @xmath75 ; this explains why @xmath18 is the most unstable point for @xmath41 disclinations .",
    "we have numerically confirmed that the splay term @xmath66 in eq.([eq : energy ] ) plays a dominant role in describing the @xmath47- ( and @xmath49- ) dependences of @xmath46 .",
    "figures [ fig : mcontour](a)(b ) show contour plots of the splay term @xmath66 within the disclination area of @xmath41 .",
    "we observe that with an increase in @xmath47 , the local splay energy decreases at points near @xmath76 but increases near @xmath77 ; this is in agreement with our previous discussions .",
    "a more detailed version of the study that covers the variations of the disclination size @xmath39 and the initial angle @xmath40 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the elastic energy of disclinations that arise in a curved nematic membrane with a gaussian bump geometry .",
    "when @xmath78 , the disclination energy @xmath46 exhibits a downward peak at @xmath62 independently of the sign of the disclination charge , suggesting a curvature - driven halo formation of disclinations around the top of the bump .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath56 , @xmath46 for @xmath41 exhibits a double - well structure in which the point @xmath62 becomes unstable in contrast to the case of @xmath57 ; this implies doubly concentric halos peculiar to negatively charged disclinations . in both cases of @xmath42 ,",
    "the well depth overcomes the thermal energy scale at room temperature , suggesting the experimental feasibility of our theoretical predictions .",
