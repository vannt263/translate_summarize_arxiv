    "one of the most striking features of galaxy redshift surveys is the presence of large regions of space that are nearly devoid of galaxies .",
    "these `` voids '' are thought to form from the most underdense regions of the initial density field , although other suggestions exist such as cosmic explosions @xcite or first order phase transitions @xcite . while voids have been seen in redshift surveys since the late 1970 s @xcite , due to their large size and low number density it is only with the advent of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that the statistical properties of voids will be quantified in a meaningful way .",
    "it is well known that the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony produces voids in the distribution of dark matter ( i.e. highly underdense regions which are not , however , completely empty of dark matter ) , and the properties of these voids are well studied @xcite .",
    "the properties of voids , and the galaxies which live within them have been proposed as a strong test of the cdm scenario @xcite .",
    "however , there have been very few theoretical studies of voids in the _ galaxy _ distribution expected in cdm ( with the notable exception of ) , primarily due to the lack of a detailed , physical model for galaxy formation in the past .",
    "it is known both theoretically and observationally that at least some galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter ( davis & geller 1976 ; for recent results see hoyle et al . 1999 ,",
    "benson et al .",
    "2000a ) , even though @xmath3 galaxies may be close to unbiased , as shown in the 2dfgrs by .",
    "recent studies of the dependence of clustering amplitude on galaxy luminosity and morphology in the sdss @xcite and the 2dfgrs @xcite show a substantial increase with luminosity of the correlation function amplitude which is only partly induced by the variations in the morphological mix of galaxies .",
    "consequently , we can not expect voids in the distributions of galaxies and dark matter to have the same statistical properties .",
    "in fact we will show that they can be quite different .    in this work we aim to remedy this deficiency by presenting predictions for the simplest and most useful statistical quantifiers of galaxy voids in a cdm universe using a combination of n - body simulations of dark matter and semi - analytical modelling of galaxy formation .",
    "this technique has been demonstrated to naturally explain several aspects of galaxy clustering  such as the near power - law shape of the galaxy correlation function and the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity @xcite .",
    "such an approach is currently the only means to make physically realistic predictions for galaxy voids ( the only competitive method for modelling galaxy formation  direct hydrodynamical simulation  can not currently be applied to sufficiently large volumes of the universe with the desired resolution ) .",
    "we will make predictions specifically aimed at the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys , and will contrast our results with previous analytical and numerical studies .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we describe the construction of galaxy catalogues and the details of the analysis which we apply to them . in ",
    "[ sec : statistics ] ,  [ sec : props ] and  [ sec : vgals ] we present results for a variety of statistical properties of voids and the galaxies within them . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we present our conclusions .",
    "catalogues of mock galaxies are constructed using the techniques of , to which the reader is referred for full details .",
    "briefly , we use the semi - analytic model of with extensions due to to populate dark matter halos located in n - body simulations with galaxies . in this particular approach ,",
    "dark matter halos are located in the simulation using the friends - of - friends technique together with an energy criterion to ensure the halos represent physical , bound objects .",
    "we retain halos containing ten or more particles .",
    "the semi - analytic model is used to predict the properties of galaxies occupying each halo by accounting for the rate at which gas can cool and turn into stars , galaxy - galaxy mergers and feedback from supernovae .",
    "galaxies are then assigned a position ( both in real and redshift - space ) within the halo , resulting in a three dimensional distribution of galaxies .",
    "we use the same two n - body simulations as , which we refer to as the `` gif '' and `` @xmath4 '' , which have cosmological parameters @xmath5km / s / mpc . ] and particle masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "we also make use of a third simulation , which we refer to as `` gif - ii '' , which has the exact same parameters as the gif simulation , but with a different realization of the initial conditions .",
    "this gif - ii simulation will therefore provide a means to quantify uncertainties in the results from the gif simulation due to its limited volume .",
    "the two simulations differ in mass resolution and volume as detailed in table  [ tb : sims ] , where we also list the faintest absolute magnitudes in @xmath8 and r - bands ( appropriate to the 2dfgrs and sdss respectively ) to which our mock galaxy catalogues are complete in each simulation , along with the characteristic magnitude @xmath9 measured in these two surveys .",
    "( for the @xmath4 simulation these limits are comparable to @xmath9 , while for the gif simulation they are almost two magnitudes fainter than @xmath9 . ) at fainter magnitudes the limited resolution of the simulation means that some galaxies are missed .",
    "these magnitudes are relatively bright , perhaps significantly brighter than we might expect to be typical of `` void galaxies '' .",
    "higher resolution simulations , allowing us to probe to fainter magnitudes , would clearly provide stronger tests of the void phenomenon in cdm models . note that with our scheme for constructing mock galaxy catalogues , morphological evolution is correctly tracked for all galaxies brighter than this luminosity limit .",
    "the gif simulation allows us to examine somewhat fainter galaxies than the @xmath4 but is of limited usefulness for studying voids because of its relatively small volume ( voids have very low number densities ) .",
    "the @xmath4 simulation on the other hand is of sufficiently large volume to provide a statistically useful sample of voids .",
    "we will construct galaxy catalogues for a variety of absolute magnitude limits .",
    "for each galaxy catalogue we construct we create a `` dark matter '' catalogue with the same number density of points by randomly selecting dark matter particles from the n - body simulations . these dark matter",
    "catalogues will allow us to examine differences between the properties of voids in the dark matter and galaxy distributions ( i.e. the `` bias '' of the galaxy distribution ) .",
    "voids in an unbiased population of galaxies would have statistical properties identical to those in our dark matter catalogues .",
    "all catalogues use distributions of galaxies or dark matter in redshift space ( i.e. we shift each galaxy in the catalogue a distance @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the peculiar velocity of the galaxy , along the x - direction to account for redshift space distortions ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     show that voids in redshift surveys and in mock galaxy catalogues built from cdm simulations obey a simple scaling relation , such that the median void radius , @xmath12 , obeys @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean galaxy separation of the sample in question and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : voidscaling ] we show the @xmath12@xmath14 relation for voids in our simulations .",
    "we compute @xmath12 for all the galaxy samples using both the gif and @xmath4 simulations .",
    "note that there is little difference seen in the median void size between galaxy and dark matter samples . the differences in the void size distribution seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : voidsizescompare ] occur only for the largest voids , which have very low number density and so have little impact on the median void size .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are determined using a least squares fit , including only those points for which 75% of the voids in the sample have radii in excess of the completeness limit for the simulation in question . for the 2dfgrs sample",
    "we find @xmath17 and @xmath18 , while for the sdss sample we find @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the scaling relations for our two samples are consistent within the errorbars .",
    "our results differ somewhat from those of , who find higher values of @xmath16 , and larger values of @xmath15 for cdm mock galaxy catalogues constructed using a simple biassing scheme and for the las campanas redshift survey .",
    "this is not surprising given that we employ a different void finding algorithm , but does serve to highlight the importance of analyzing model and observations using the same algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , such a linear scaling relation with slope @xmath21 is found in both void detection schemes , suggesting that it may be a generic feature of the void distribution .      in the void finder algorithm voids",
    "need not be entirely devoid of galaxies .",
    "galaxies with few nearby neighbours are classified as `` void galaxies '' and _ may _ be located within the subsequently detected voids . to assess the prevalence of such galaxies , and the larger scale structure surrounding voids , we have determined void density contrast profiles from our simulations . to do this",
    "we determine the number density of galaxies in concentric shells centred on each void centre , scaling all length scales by the void radius to allow us to compare voids of different sizes .",
    "we sum the resulting number density profiles over all voids in a particular range of radii and convert this into a density contrast profile .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : voidprofile ] .",
    "we show results for both galaxy and dark matter catalogues ( filled and open points respectively ) , for a range of minimum void sizes and for two different magnitude selections ( as indicated in the panels ) .",
    "voids are highly underdense , galaxy voids more so than dark matter voids ( typically density contrasts are @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively for the @xmath24 sample ) , again demonstrating the biasing of galaxies relative to dark matter ( this can be seen most clearly in the upper left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : voidprofile ] ) .",
    "there is little variation in density contrast within much of the void , but there is evidence for a decline in density contrast in the very central regions of the voids .",
    "there is a clear threshold corresponding to the edge of each void which occurs close to @xmath25 , especially for the @xmath26 sample , indicating that the void finder algorithm is working successfully . beyond the void radius we find the density contrast increases rapidly ( more rapidly for galaxies than dark matter ) , but",
    "can remain below unity for a significant distance .",
    "thus , for our @xmath24 sample the regions around voids are , on average , still underdense even at twice the void radius .",
    "these findings are in qualitative agreement with the void density profiles reported by , with the exception that our voids are less dense ( for both galaxies and dark matter ) , and their boundaries are sharper ( i.e. density contrast increases more rapidly beyond the void radius ) .",
    "this is again a consequence of the differing algorithms for defining voids in the two approaches , highlighting the importance of analysing observations and theoretical models in identical ways .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : vgalsgif ] we show , for the gif simulation , the distributions of galaxy luminosities , colours , morphologies and star formation rates for both the general population ( dotted histograms ) and for galaxies living within voids ( i.e. those galaxies lying within the spherical voids found using the void finder ; solid histograms ) . note that the fraction of galaxies which are actually located within voids ( shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : vgalsgif ] ) is much lower than the fraction of galaxies classified as `` void galaxies '' by the void finder algorithm .",
    "a similar result is found for the observational samples employed by .",
    "it is clear that void galaxies have systematically different properties to the general population ",
    "although the differences are typically rather small ( similar results are found in the @xmath4 simulation ) .",
    "nevertheless , a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the void and field galaxy samples are inconsistent with being drawn from a single underlying distribution ( the probability being less than 6% in all cases ) .",
    "void galaxies are typically fainter and bluer , are more disk - dominated and show higher star formation rates .",
    "all of these differences can be traced to the difference in dark matter halo mass functions in voids ( indeed , in our model , this is the only possible means of creating a difference between voids and the general field ) .",
    "for example , in the field some fraction of galaxies fall into clusters where their supply of fresh gas is `` strangled '' ( i.e. their diffuse halos of hot gas is removed by the ram pressure and tidal forces due to the cluster ) , resulting in a cessation of star formation . since there are no clusters in voids this process is far less important for void galaxies .    for the samples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgalsgif ] the halo mass function ( for halos occupied by one of the galaxies ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : halomf ] .",
    "clearly the halo mass function of void galaxies ( solid line ) is shifted to much lower masses relative to that of the field sample ( dotted line ) .",
    "the median occupied halo mass is over 6 times lower for void galaxies than for field galaxies .",
    "the majority of these void galaxies live at the centre of their halo , whereas in the general population we find a large fraction of the galaxies existing as satellites in more massive halos .",
    "we are also able to explore how the star formation rate of galaxies varies with radius inside voids . in fig .",
    "[ fig : voidsfr ] we show the mean specific star formation rate ( i.e. the star formation rate per unit mass of stars ) in model galaxies as a function of their normalized distance from the nearest void centre , where we include only voids larger than a particular radius ( as indicated in the figure ) .",
    "results are shown for two b@xmath27-band selected samples as indicated in the figure ( the fainter one drawn from the gif simulation , the brighter one from the @xmath4 simulation ) .",
    "results for the full samples of galaxies are shown by the filled points .",
    "there is a clear trend for higher specific star formation rates as we move towards the centres of voids ( for the fainter sample in particular , the trend is seen out to twice the void radius ) .",
    "there are two contributions to this effect .",
    "firstly , outside of voids we find very massive halos which contain large populations of satellite galaxies . in our model",
    "these galaxies have lost their supply of fresh gas , and so star formation is strongly suppressed in these systems . since such massive halos are very rare in voids the majority of void galaxies are the dominant galaxy of their halo , so retain a gas supply allowing higher rates of star formation .",
    "we can see the contribution of this effect by repeating this calculation using only central galaxies ( i.e. those with a continued gas supply ) , as shown by the open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : voidsfr ] . for the fainter sample in particular this can be seen to be the dominant contributor to the trend . a secondary contributor to the trend",
    "is that , even for galaxies with a continued gas supply , specific star formation rates tend to be higher for lower mass galaxies in our model .",
    "this weaker trend is visible in the open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : voidsfr ] .    larger differences _",
    "may _ occur for fainter samples of galaxies , below the resolution limit of our simulations . if faint field galaxies exist mostly as satellites in massive groups and clusters ( which are not located in voids ) then significant differences between field and void samples could occur .",
    "if , on the other hand , faint field galaxies exist mostly in lower mass halos ( where the differences between field and void halo mass functions are much smaller ) we would expect the differences to be smaller also .",
    "benson et al .",
    "( in preparation ) examine the relative contributions of satellite and non - satellite galaxies to the galaxy luminosity function , finding that satellites become the dominant contribution faintwards of @xmath28 , suggesting that we would need to probe over two magnitudes fainter than currently possible to see significant differences between void and field galaxies .",
    "we have presented detailed theoretical predictions for a wide range of statistics related to voids in the distribution of galaxies , and for properties of galaxies living within those voids .",
    "these predictions have been specifically aimed at the 2dfgrs and sdss , which , due to their large size , should provide accurate measures of these statistics .",
    "we have focussed on simple selection criteria , namely simple cuts in luminosity , which we believe will permit the most robust comparison between theory and observations .",
    "the properties of voids and void galaxies are potentially a strong constraint on models of structure and galaxy formation .",
    "however , we have shown that many of the properties of galaxy and dark matter voids differ significantly , indicating ( as we have shown ) that galaxy bias as well as gravitational instability is important for the formation of galaxy voids .",
    "although our understanding of galaxy bias has progressed greatly in recent years we can not be certain that our understanding is complete . where suitable data already exist ( specifically the void and underdense probability functions analysis applied to the cfa surveys by ) we find that the model is consistent with the data , but that the current observational sample is too small to probe the signal of bias expected from our model .",
    "this situation should be rectified when this analysis is repeated on larger redshift surveys .",
    "as has been shown in previous works on galaxy clustering using semi - analytic and n - body techniques , the results are rather robust to changes in model parameters @xcite .",
    "if we compute void statistics such as the vpf , nearest neighbour distributions or void size distributions at a fixed number density then our predictions are unaffected by changes in most model parameters ( e.g. the strength of supernovae feedback , the star formation timescales in galaxies etc . ) .",
    "this results from the fact that the main effect of changing these parameters is to change galaxy luminosities without significantly changing the ranking of galaxy luminosity .",
    "predictions are changed by parameters in the model which do change the ranking of luminosities .",
    "for example , significantly increasing or decreasing the rates of galaxy mergers can make strong differences in some of the statistics considered here .",
    "( note however , that with the improved merging model of we no longer have the freedom to adjust merger rates in our model . ) the properties of void galaxies ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : vgalsgif ] ) _ are _ affected by changes in model parameters . as the differences between void and wall galaxies seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgalsgif ] are so small we choose not to explore the dependencies of these properties on model parameters in this work .",
    "the models employed in our analysis include the effects of `` photoionization suppression '' as described by .",
    "this feedback mechanism has the potential to strongly alter the properties of voids in the galaxy distribution .",
    "halos in voids are of lower mass on average than in higher density regions . since photoionization suppression acts most effectively on low - mass halos it will cause greatest suppression of galaxy formation in voids .",
    "( furthermore , although not included in our present modelling , reionization of the universe may begin in voids , enhancing the suppression in these regions further . ) for the lowest mass galaxies resolved in our current n - body simulations the effects of photoionization suppression are negligible ( e.g. the vpf and nearest neighbour distributions for galaxy samples of fixed number density are indistinguishable between models with and without photoionization suppression ) .",
    "we may expect however strong differences to show up in higher resolution simulations .",
