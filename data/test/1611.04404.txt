    "graphene is a target of an intense forefront research both in fundamental science and in nano - technological applications because of its peculiar electronic and structural properties .",
    "specifically , its relatively large surface area and rich edge termination possibilities make graphene particularly appealing for nanoelectronics@xcite , biosensors@xcite , energy storage and conversion@xcite , and nanocatalysis@xcite . in the specific field of semiconductor devices , the high carrier mobility and the possibility of patterning or growing nanographene flakes of desired shape and",
    "size@xcite have paved the way to new possibilities in the efforts of overcoming limitations of both current and future electronics .",
    "the originally proposed exfoliation of graphite @xcite is still a practical and useful way to make high - quality graphene .",
    "however , its poor yield makes this method unsuitable for technological applications .",
    "an alternative and promising way to form graphene is the thermal decomposition of silicon carbide ( sic ) @xcite , since it can find direct applications in the realization of electronic devices .",
    "sic is a semiconductor widely used in power electronics because of its robustness in harsh environments such as high voltage and high temperature @xcite .",
    "thermal decomposition , upon proper thermodynamical conditions , is a versatile technique to dislodge si atoms from the sic network , leaving behind high quality graphene flakes or islands@xcite .",
    "this thermal decomposition is promising in a wealth of applications since it provides large - area graphene supported on regular sic substrates . being sic a wide band - gap semiconductor , the resulting graphene / sic heterostructure is particularly appealing for direct applications in electronic devices . yet",
    ", the process that leads to the formation of this type of supported nanographene has still to be fully unraveled .",
    "in fact , such a reaction involves drastic modifications of the bonding environment and related electronic structure that are beyond the reach of experimental probes .",
    "what is known to date is that si atoms are desorbed selectively from the sic , leading to a carbon - rich @xmath0 buffer layer @xcite , and then eventually graphene layers are formed on the sic(0001 ) surface .",
    "electron microscopy experiments have revealed that the formation of these graphene layers occurs where atomic steps are present on the sic surface @xcite and , particularly , in the regions where the step density is high @xcite .",
    "in fact , the sic ( 0001 ) exhibits peculiar nanofacets @xcite resulting upon heat treatment and subsequent hydrogen etching done to polish the surface @xcite .",
    "this type of nanofacet is now identified as a bunched single bilayer atomic steps , for which atomistic calculations @xcite based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite have been done aimed at inspecting the local structure . after the formation of the buffer carbon layer , subsequent graphene layers can grow from the interface of the buffer layer and sic@xcite . however , the underlying mechanism is still elusive .    to unravel the microscopic mechanisms responsible for this formation of graphene structures on sic , we resort to the dft  based calculations aimed at clarifying the pathways",
    "along which si atoms are dislodged from the sic network .",
    "we work out the associated energy barriers characterizing the possible reaction paths , tracking the processes that lead to the formation of the initial carbon seeds from which graphene can subsequently grow .",
    "former dft calculations for carbon layers on sic(0001 ) @xcite were focused mainly on the structural stability of a selected set of carbon overlayers and , as such , they provide little information about the actual reaction mechanisms . from the experimental observation described above",
    ", the essential and basic processes of the graphene growth seem to be summarizable in two stages : ( i ) si atoms are desorbed from the nanofacet , i.e. , the bunched atomic steps , and ( ii ) the aggregation of residual c occurs near the step edges from which the si atoms departed .",
    "starting our investigation from this basic idea , we elucidate the mechanisms of the elemental processes responsible for the formation of the initial graphene seeds and provide a comprehensive picture of all possible reaction pathways that the system can exhibit upon desorption , including the fate of the si atoms that leave the sic network .",
    "the desorption processes on which we focus here are the ones in which an edge atom is dislodged and , subsequently , it migrates to suitable sites on either a lower or an upper terrace .",
    "the choice of these specific atoms is clearly dictated by the aforementioned experimental evidence@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider all possible si and c desorption pathways from nanofacets in order to get a comprehensive scenario about the desorption of both chemical species and the possible edge sites from which such desorption might occur .",
    "we then consider the migration of either si or c desorbed atom to the sites called t4 or h3 which have been identified as stable adatom sites on the terrace@xcite .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section [ method ]",
    ", we explain the methodology and computational approaches used in the present set of calculations .",
    "the obtained reaction pathways for the desorption of si and c from the step edge and their subsequent migration are presented and discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section [ sum ] .",
    "sic exists as various polytypes in which the stacking of atomic bilayers along the bond direction differs .",
    "each one of these polytypes is identified and labeled according to the periodicity of the stacking sequence and its symmetry ( cubic or hexagonal ) such as 2h ( wurtzite ) , 3c ( zincblende ) , 4h , 6h and so forth . among all these possible polytypes ,",
    "the one labeled as 4h is the most stable , being characterized by the larger cohesive energy and , for this reason , commonly used in experiments .",
    "the sequence of the biatomic layers along the ( 0001 ) direction in 4h - sic is @xmath1 abcb @xmath1 .",
    "the cleavage of this bulk structure can result in two inequivalent surfaces : in one surface , starting from the exposed top layer , the sequence is abcb@xmath1 and in the other it is bcba @xmath1 .",
    "the former is referred to as cubic surface , whereas the latter is termed hexagonal surface , following the name of the bulk polytype with the same atomic - layer sequence .        as mentioned in section",

    ", we consider the desorption of either si or c atoms from sb steps of sic(0001 ) surfaces and the subsequent migration of the desorbed atom .",
    "the system is modeled as a periodic supercell containing one slab in which the top surface presents upper and lower terraces bordered by a sb step parallel to the @xmath4 $ ] direction .",
    "our model has a lateral size of @xmath5 and is composed of 280 atoms .",
    "the bottom surface is fixed to the bulk crystallographic positions and terminated by h atoms to compensate for the missing bonds , whereas the rest of the system is allowed to evolve and relax freely .",
    "each slab consists of five or four bilayers ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ init - c - edge ] ) and each slab is separated by a vacuum region of more than 8  to minimize the interaction between its periodically repeated images .",
    "all simulations are done with the rsdft code@xcite , in which the kohn - sham equation is discretized on a three - dimensional grid in real space .",

    "valence interaction is described by norm - conserving pseudopotentials generated by the recipe proposed by troullier and martins@xcite .",
    "the brillouin - zone integration is performed on two @xmath6-points sampled along the step edge direction .",

    "the geometry optimized sb step structure constructed in this way is shown in figure [ init - c - edge ] .",
    "the equilibrium distance between the si atom on the step edge and the adjacent si site on the lower terrace is 2.43  , considerably shorter than the unrelaxed length ( 3.10  ) as cleaved from the bulk , but longer than the typical si  si bulk bond length ( 2.37  ) .",
    "reaction pathways and energy barriers are calculated by using the hyperplane constraint method@xcite . in this method",
    ", we first determine a line in the 3@xmath8 dimensional space ( @xmath8 : the number of atoms in the simulation cell ) which connects the initial and the final or the intermediate metastable structures for a selected reaction pathway",
    ". then a suitable number of points along these lines is selected and geometry optimizations are performed on each point by minimizing all the force components perpendicular to this line : i.e. , the constraint minimization on each hyperplane perpendicular to the line .",
    "this results in probable reaction pathways .",
    "it is necessary to select sufficiently large number of the points to ensure a good and fine sampling of the pathway .    in this paper , we present the results for the sb step where the top - most surface is cubic for the upper terrace and hexagonal for the lower one , as shown , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ init - c - edge ] .",
    "an alternative geometry for the sb step consists in a hexagonal upper terrace and a cubic lower terrace .",
    "we have also examined the desorption from this alternative system and found that the energetics in the desorption processes are analogous to that from the sb step with the cubic upper and the hexagonal lower terraces , as will be explained in the following section .    .",
    "to cope with the complexity of the possible processes along which the desorption of atoms from a step edge can evolve , we have considered all the possible alternative pathways for either si or c departing from their original position and ending to a stable t4 or h3 site located on the terrace .",

    "this lower stability is far from negligible , since the four structures ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are energetically located above the initial configuration by 1.46 , 1.40 , 1.95 and 2.26 ev , respectively .",

    "our density - functional calculations have unequivocally revealed that two si atoms are desorbed from the step edge and migrate toward stable sites on the terrace with the energy gain of 0.2 ev compared with the stable clean stepped surfaces .",
    "this exothermicity comes from the energy gain caused by the bond formation between c atoms being left at the step edge .",
    "this structural outcome is the seed of the graphene flakes .",
    "we have also found that the energy barriers for the single - si and two - si desorption reactions are about 1.0  1.5 ev , reflecting the structural characteristics of the transition state , i.e. , the two - fold coordinated desorbed atom .",
    "it is thus highly likely that the subsequent si desorption also costs this amount of energy per atom . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth of carbon bond network near the step edge provides larger energy gain with the increase in the number of departing si atoms or equivalently the number of the lonely c atoms .",

    "<S> we find that the energy barrier for the desorption of an si atom at the step edge and the subsequent migration toward stable terrace sites are lower than that of a c atom by 0.75 ev , indicative of the selective desorption of si from the sic surface . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the subsequent si desorption is an exothermic reaction . </S>",
    "<S> this exothermicity comes from the energy gain due to the bond formation of c atoms being left near the step edges . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly a seed of graphene flakes . </S>"
