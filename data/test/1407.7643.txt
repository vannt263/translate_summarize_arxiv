    "tidal interactions between galaxies , where at least one of them is gas rich , can result in tidal stripping of large amounts of  from the potential of the parent galaxy(s ) .",
    "most of this stripped   will eventually fall back into the potential of one or other of the interacting galaxies or be incorporated into the intra  group medium ( igm ) .",
    "but if the   densities are sufficient and environmental conditions are favourable , self - gravitating bodies with masses typical of dwarf galaxies , called tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdg ) , may form within the tidally stripped gas ( duc & mirabel 1999 ; duc et al .",
    "a key observational problem is tdgs from older standard dwarfs because some tdgs contain old stars from their parent galaxies .",
    "consist almost entirely of young stars formed in situ from  stripped from the parents during the interaction ( duc & mirabel 1999 ; duc et al .",
    "2000 ; braine et al .",
    "2001 ) . a combination of evidence linking the tdg candidate to interacting parents and stellar population studies is normally used to identify tdg candidates , although indisputable criteria remain to be accepted .",
    "tdgs are usually observed during an active star forming stage thus allowing tests of star formation criteria and stellar to gas relationships in low gas density environments . as tdgs form from stripped gas",
    "they are expected to contain little or no dark matter .",
    "this makes them valuable in studying the role and importance of dark matter in galaxy formation .",
    "tdgs are also expected to be metal rich in comparison to normal dwarfs , the gas from which tdgs form originates from more evolved , usually large , late  type galaxies .",
    "the lack of dark matter in they are more vulnerable to disruption by further tidal interactions than normal dwarfs .",
    "tdgs provide a unique environment to investigate the processes governing formation and evolution of galaxies .        to address the issue of in  situ star and tdg formation in tidal gas debris ,",
    "a multi  wavelength study of a sample of arp interacting galaxies ( the ` spirals , bridges , and tails ' ( sb&t ) sample ) is being carried out @xcite . _",
    "_ galex _ _ , spitzer and h@xmath0 observations of these systems have revealed evidence of in - situ star formation and tdg candidates .",
    "one such system is the arp 202 close pair of galaxies , ngc2719 and ngc2719a , which have radial velocities 3077 km s@xmath1 and 3117 km s@xmath1 respectively and signs of a tidal interaction at optical wavelengths ( figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "deep uv _ ( galex ) _ observations of this system revealed a tidal tail like extension which appears to originate from ngc2719a with a diffuse object towards its end , .    in this paper , we present results from our giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt )  observations of the arp 202 system including at the position of the proposed tdg .",
    "the paper also utilises available data and images .",
    "section [ obs ] sets out details of our observations , and the results are given in section [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the results in section [ dis ] . a summary and concluding remarks are set out in section [ summary ] .",
    "the average of the radial velocities of ngc2719 and ngc2719a is 3097 km s@xmath1 . using this average velocity and assuming h@xmath2 to be 75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1",
    ", we adopt a distance of 41.3 mpc for ngc2719 and ngc2719a and the tdg . at this distance",
    "the spatial scale is 12 kpc / arcmin .",
    "j2000 coordinates are used throughout the paper , including in the figures .",
    "observations of arp 202 were carried out with the gmrt on april 30th , 2008 .",
    "further details of the observations are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the baseband bandwidth used was 8 mhz for the  21-cm line observations giving a velocity resolution of @xmath313 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package was used for data reduction .",
    "bad data from malfunctioning antennas , antennas with low gain and/or radio frequency interference ( rfi ) were flagged .",
    "the flux densities are on the scale of @xcite , with flux density uncertainties of @xmath35% . using the aips tasks uvsub and uvlin . to analyse the  structures , image cubes of different resolutions were produced by applying different ` tapers ' to the data with varied _ uv _ limits .",
