    "with the recent appearance of the internet and the world - wide web , understanding the properties of growing networks with popularity - based construction rules has become an active and fruitful research area @xcite . in such models ,",
    "newly - introduced nodes preferentially attach to pre - existing nodes of the network that are already `` popular '' .",
    "this leads to graphs whose structure is quite different from the well - known _ random graph _",
    "@xcite in which links are created at random between nodes without regard to their popularity .",
    "this discovery of a new class of graph theory problems has fueled much effort to characterize their properties .",
    "one basic measure of the structure of such networks is the _ node degree _",
    "@xmath5 defined as the number of nodes in the network that are linked to @xmath0 other nodes . in the case of the random graph , the node degree is simply a poisson distribution .",
    "in contrast , many popularity - driven growing networks have much broader degree distributions with a stretched exponential or a power - law tail .",
    "the latter form means that there is no characteristic scale for the node degree , a feature that typifies many networked systems @xcite .",
    "power laws , or more generally , distributions with highly skewed tails , characterize the degree distributions of many man - made and naturally occurring networks @xcite .",
    "for example , the degree distributions at the level of autonomous systems and at the router level exhibit highly skewed tails @xcite .",
    "other important internet - based graphs , such as the hyperlink graph of the world - wide web also appear to have a degree distribution with a power - law tail @xcite .",
    "these observations have spurred a flurry of recent work to understand the underlying mechanisms for these phenomena .",
    "a related example with interest to anyone who publishes , is the distribution of scientific citations @xcite .",
    "here one treats publications as nodes and citations as links in a citation graph .",
    "currently - available data suggests that the citation distribution has a power - law tail with an associated exponent close to @xmath6 @xcite . as we shall see ,",
    "this exponent emerges naturally in the _ growing network _ ( gn ) model where the relative probability of linking from a new node to a previous node ( equivalent to citing an earlier paper ) is strictly proportional to the popularity of the target node .    in this paper",
    ", we apply tools from statistical physics , especially the rate equation approach , to quantify the structure of growing networks and to elucidate the types of geometrical features that arise in networks with physically - motivated growth rules .",
    "the utility of the rate equations has been demonstrated in a diverse range of phenomena in non - equilibrium statistical physics , such as aggregation @xcite , coarsening @xcite , and epitaxial surface growth @xcite .",
    "we will attempt to convince the reader that the rate equations are also a simple yet powerful analysis tool to analyze growing network systems .",
    "in addition to providing comprehensive information about the node degree distribution , the rate equations can be easily adapted to analyze both heterogeneous and directed networks , the age distribution of nodes , correlations between node degrees , various global network properties , as well as the cluster size distribution in models that give rise to independently evolving sub - networks .",
    "thus the rate equation method appears to be better suited for probing the structure of growing networks compared to the classical approaches for analyzing random graphs , such as probabilistic @xcite or generating function @xcite techniques .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce three basic models that will be the focus of this review . in the following three sections , we then present rate equation analyses to determine basic geometrical properties of these networks .",
    "we close with a brief summary .",
    "the models we study appear to embody many of the basic growth processes in web graphs and related systems .",
    "these include :    * the _ growing network _ ( gn ) @xcite .",
    "nodes are added one at a time and a single link is established between the new node and a pre - existing node according to an attachment probability @xmath7 that depends only on the degree of the `` target '' node ( fig .  [ network ] ) .",
    "+    +  [ network ] * the _ web graph _ ( wg ) .",
    "this represents an extension of the gn to incorporate link directionality @xcite and leads to independent , dynamically generated in - degree and out - degree distributions .",
    "the network growth occurs by two distinct processes @xcite that are meant to mimic how hyperlinks are created in the web ( fig .",
    "[ io - growth ] ) : * * with probability @xmath8 , a new node is introduced and it immediately attaches to an earlier target node .",
    "the attachment probability depends only on the in - degree of the target . * * with probability @xmath9 , a new link is created between already existing nodes .",
    "the choices of the originating and target nodes depend on the out - degree of the former and the in - degree of the latter .",
    "+    * the _ multicomponent graph _ ( mg ) .",
    "nodes and links are introduced _ independently _ @xcite .",
    "( i ) with probability @xmath8 , a new _ unlinked _ node is introduced , while ( ii ) with probability @xmath9 , a new link is created between existing nodes . as in the wg",
    ", the choices of the originating and target nodes depend on the out - degree of the former and the in - degree of the latter .",
    "step ( i ) allows for the formation of many clusters .",
    "because of its simplicity , we first study the structure of the gn @xcite . the basic approaches developed in this section",
    "will then be extended to the wg and mg models .",
    "we first focus on the node degree distribution @xmath5 . to determine its evolution , we shall write the rate equations that account for the change in the degree distribution after each node addition event .",
    "these equations contain complete information about the node degree , from which any measure of node degree ( such as moments ) can be easily extracted . for the gn growth process in",
    "which nodes are introduced one at a time , the rate equations for the degree distribution @xmath10 are @xcite @xmath11 the first term on the right , @xmath12 , accounts for processes in which a node with @xmath13 links is connected to the new node , thus increasing @xmath5 by one . since there are @xmath14 nodes of degree @xmath13 , the rate at which such processes occur is proportional to @xmath15 , and the factor @xmath16 converts this rate into a normalized probability .",
    "a corresponding role is played by the second ( loss ) term on the right - hand side ; @xmath17 is the probability that a node with @xmath0 links is connected to the new node , thus leading to a loss in @xmath5 .",
    "the last term accounts for the introduction of new nodes with no incoming links .",
    "we start by solving for the time dependence of the moments of the degree distribution defined via @xmath18 .",
    "this is a standard method of analysis of rate equations by which one can gain partial , but valuable , information about the time dependence of the system with minimal effort . by explicitly summing eqs .",
    "( [ nk ] ) over all @xmath0 , we easily obtain @xmath19 , whose solution is @xmath20 .",
    "notice that by definition @xmath21 is just the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "it is clear by the nature of the growth process that this quantity simply grows as @xmath22 . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the first moment of the degree distribution obeys @xmath23 with solution @xmath24 .",
    "this time evolution for @xmath25 can be understood either by explicitly summing the rate equations , or by observing that this first moment simply equals the total number of link endpoints .",
    "clearly , this quantity must grow as @xmath26 since the introduction of a single node introduces two link endpoints .",
    "thus we find the simple result that the first two moments are _ independent _ of the attachment kernel @xmath7 and grow _ linearly _ with time . on the other hand , higher moments and the degree distribution itself",
    "do depend in an essential way on the kernel @xmath7 .    as a preview to the general behavior for the degree distribution ,",
    "consider the strictly linear kernel @xcite , for which @xmath27 coincides with @xmath28 . in this case , we can solve eqs .",
    "( [ nk ] ) for an arbitrary initial condition . however , since the long - time behavior is most interesting , we limit ourselves to the asymptotic regime ( @xmath29 ) where the initial condition is irrelevant . using therefore @xmath30 ,",
    "we solve the first few of eqs .",
    "( [ nk ] ) directly and obtain @xmath31 , @xmath32 , _",
    "etc_. thus each of the @xmath5 grow linearly with time .",
    "accordingly , we substitute @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "( [ nk ] ) to yield the simple recursion relation @xmath34 . solving for @xmath35",
    "gives @xmath36    returning to the case of general attachment kernels , let us assume that the degree distribution and @xmath27 both grow linearly with time .",
    "this hypothesis can be easily verified numerically for attachment kernels that do not grow faster than linearly with @xmath0 . then substituting @xmath33 and @xmath37 into eqs .",
    "( [ nk ] ) we obtain the recursion relation @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "finally , solving for @xmath35 , we obtain the formal expression @xmath40 to complete the solution , we need the amplitude @xmath41 . using the definition @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ nkgen ] ) , we obtain the implicit relation @xmath43 which shows that the amplitude @xmath41 depends on the entire attachment kernel .    for the generic case @xmath44",
    ", we substitute this form into eq .",
    "( [ nkgen ] ) and then rewrite the product as the exponential of a sum of a logarithm . in the continuum limit , we convert this sum to an integral , expand the logarithm to lowest order , and then evaluate the integral to yield the following basic results : @xmath45 , & $ 0\\leq\\gamma<1$;\\cr k^{-\\nu } , \\quad \\nu>2 , & $ \\gamma=1$;\\cr { \\rm best\\ seller } & $ 1<\\gamma<2$;\\cr { \\rm bible } & $ 2<\\gamma$.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus the degree distribution decays exponentially for @xmath46 , as in the case of the random graph , while for all @xmath47 , the distribution exhibits robust stretched exponential behavior .",
    "the linear kernel is the case that has garnered much of the current research interest . as shown above , @xmath48}$ ] for the strictly linear kernel @xmath49 .",
    "one might anticipate that @xmath50 holds for all _ asymptotically _ linear kernels , @xmath51 .",
    "however , the situation is more delicate and the degree distribution exponent depends on microscopic details of @xmath7 . from eq .",
    "( [ nkgen ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 , where the exponent @xmath53 can be tuned to _ any _ value larger than 2 @xcite .",
    "this non - universal behavior shows that one must be cautious in drawing general conclusions from the gn with a linear attachment kernel .    ,",
    "out - degree @xmath54 , and total degree 9.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    [ degrees ]    as an illustrative example of the vagaries of asymptotically linear kernels , consider the shifted linear kernel @xmath55 .",
    "one way to motivate this kernel is to explicitly keep track of link directionality . in particular",
    ", the node degree for an undirected graph naturally generalizes to the in - degree and out - degree for a directed graph , the number of incoming and outgoing links at a node , respectively .",
    "thus the total degree @xmath0 in a directed graph is the sum of the in - degree @xmath56 and out - degree @xmath57 ( fig .  [ degrees ] ) .",
    "( more details on this model are given in the next section . )",
    "the most general linear attachment kernel for a directed graph has the form @xmath58 .",
    "the gn corresponds to the case where the out - degree of any node equals one ; thus @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "for this example the general linear attachment kernel reduces to @xmath61 . since the overall scale is irrelevant , we can re - write @xmath7 as the shifted linear kernel @xmath55 , with @xmath62 that can vary over the range @xmath63 .    to determine the degree distribution for the shifted linear kernel , note that @xmath64 simply equals . using @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath30 , we get @xmath67 and hence the relation @xmath53 from the previous paragraph becomes @xmath68 .",
    "thus a simple additive shift in the attachment kernel profoundly affects the asymptotic degree distribution .",
    "furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ nkgen ] ) we determine the entire degree distribution to be @xmath69    finally , we outline the intriguing behavior for super - linear kernels . in this case",
    ", there is a `` runaway '' or gelation - like phenomenon in which one node links to almost every other node . for @xmath70 ,",
    "all but a finite number of nodes are linked to a _",
    "node that has the rest of the links .",
    "we term such an overwhelmingly popular node as a `` bible '' . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the number of nodes with a just a few links is no longer finite , but grows slower than linearly in time , and the remainder of the nodes are linked to an extremely popular node that we now term `` best seller '' .",
    "full details about this runaway behavior are given in @xcite .",
    "as a final parenthetical note , when the attachment kernel has the form @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , there is preferential attachment to poorly - connected sites . here",
    ", the degree distribution exhibits faster than exponential decay , @xmath74 . when @xmath75 , the propensity for avoiding popularity is so strong that there is a finite probability of forming a `` worm '' graph in which each node attaches only to its immediate predecessor .",
    "a practically - relevant generalization of the gn is to endow each node with an intrinsic and permanently defined `` attractiveness '' @xcite .",
    "this accounts for the obvious fact that not all nodes are equivalent , but that some are clearly more attractive than others at their inception .",
    "thus the subsequent attachment rate to a node should be a function of both its degree and its intrinsic attractiveness .",
    "for this generalization , the rate equation approach yields complete results with minimal additional effort beyond that needed to solve the homogeneous network .",
    "let us assign each node an attractiveness parameter @xmath76 , with arbitrary distribution , at its inception .",
    "this attractiveness modifies the node attachment rate as follows : for a node with degree @xmath0 and attractiveness @xmath77 , the attachment rate is simply @xmath78 .",
    "now we need to characterize nodes both by their degree and their attractiveness  thus @xmath79 is the number of nodes with degree @xmath0 and attractiveness @xmath77 .",
    "this joint degree - attractiveness distribution obeys the rate equation , @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the probability that a newly - introduced node has attractiveness @xmath77 , and the normalization factor @xmath82 .",
    "following the same approach as that used to analyze eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) , we substitute @xmath65 and @xmath83 into eq .",
    "( [ nk - het ] ) to obtain the recursion relation @xmath84    for concreteness , consider the linear attachment kernel @xmath85 .",
    "then applying the same analysis as in the homogeneous network , we find @xmath86 to determine the amplitude @xmath41 we substitute ( [ nk - het ] ) into the definition @xmath87 and use the identity @xcite @xmath88 to simplify the sum .",
    "this yields the implicit relation @xmath89 this condition on @xmath41 leads to two alternatives : if the support of @xmath77 is unbounded , then the integral diverges and there is no solution for @xmath41 .",
    "in this limit , the most attractive node is connected to a finite fraction of all links .",
    "conversely , if the support of @xmath77 is bounded , the resulting degree distribution is similar to that of the homogeneous network . for fixed @xmath77 , @xmath90 with an attractiveness - dependent decay exponent @xmath91",
    "amusingly , the total degree distribution @xmath92 is no longer a strict power law @xcite .",
    "rather , the asymptotic behavior is governed by properties of the initial attractiveness distribution near the upper cutoff .",
    "in particular , if @xmath93 ( with @xmath94 to ensure normalization ) , the total degree distribution exhibits a logarithmic correction @xmath95      in addition to the degree distribution , we determine _ when _ connections occur .",
    "naively , we expect that older nodes will be better connected .",
    "we study this feature by resolving each node both by its degree and its age to provide a more complete understanding of the network evolution . thus define @xmath96 to be the average number of nodes of age @xmath97 that have @xmath13 incoming links at time @xmath22 . here",
    "age @xmath97 means that the node was introduced at time @xmath98 .",
    "the original degree distribution may be recovered from the joint age - degree distribution through @xmath99 .    for simplicity , we consider only the case of the strictly linear kernel ; more general kernels were considered in ref .",
    "the joint age - degree distribution evolves according to the rate equation @xmath100 the second term on the left accounts for the aging of nodes .",
    "we assume here that the probability of linking to a given node again depends only on its degree and not on its age .",
    "finally , we again have used @xmath101 for the linear attachment kernel in the long - time limit .",
    "the homogeneous form of this equation implies that solution should be self - similar .",
    "thus we seek a solution as a function of the _ single _ variable @xmath102 rather than two separate variables . writing @xmath103 with @xmath104 , we convert eq .",
    "( [ ck1 ] ) into the ordinary differential equation @xmath105 we omit the delta function term , since it merely provides the boundary condition @xmath106 , or @xmath107 .",
    "the solution to this boundary - value problem may be simplified by assuming the exponential solution @xmath108 ; this is consistent with the boundary condition , provided that @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this ansatz reduces the infinite set of rate equations ( [ fk1 ] ) into two elementary differential equations for @xmath111 and @xmath112 whose solutions are @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in terms of the original variables of @xmath97 and @xmath22 , the joint age - degree distribution is then @xmath115    thus the degree distribution for fixed - age nodes decays _ exponentially _ , with a characteristic degree that diverges as @xmath116 for @xmath117 . as expected , young nodes ( those with @xmath118 ) typically have a small degree while old nodes have large degree ( fig .",
    "[ age ] ) .",
    "it is the large characteristic degree of old nodes that ultimately leads to a _ power - law _ total degree distribution when the joint age - degree distribution is integrated over all ages .",

    "one such property is the correlation between degrees of connected nodes @xcite .",

    "this correlation between the degrees of connected nodes is an important distinction between the gn and classical random graphs .    while the solution of eq .",
    "( [ nkl - sol ] ) is unwieldy , it greatly simplifies in the scaling regime , @xmath139 and @xmath140 with @xmath141 finite .",
    "the scaled form of the solution is @xmath142 for fixed large @xmath0 , the distribution @xmath143 has a single maximum at @xmath144 .",

    "in addition to elucidating the degree distribution and degree correlations , the rate equations can be applied to determine global properties .",
    "one useful example is the _ out - component _ with respect to a given node * x *  this is the set of nodes that can be reached by following directed links that emanate from * x * ( fig .",

    ", the number @xmath148 of in - components with @xmath149 nodes satisfies the rate equation @xmath150 the loss term accounts for processes in which the attachment of a new node to an in - component of size @xmath149 increases its size by one .",
    "this gives a loss rate that is proportional to @xmath149 .",
    "if there is more than one in - component of size @xmath149 they must be disjoint , so that the total loss rate for @xmath148 is simply @xmath151 .",
    "a similar argument applies for the gain term .",
    "finally , dividing by @xmath152 converts these rates to normalized probabilities . for the constant attachment kernel , @xmath153 , so asymptotically @xmath154 .",
    "interestingly , eq .  ( [ ik ] ) is almost identical to the rate equations for the degree distribution for the gn with linear attachment kernel , except that the prefactor equals @xmath155 rather than @xmath156 .",
    "this change in the normalization factor is responsible for shifting the exponent of the resulting distribution from @xmath6 to @xmath157 .    to determine @xmath148 , we again note , by explicitly solving the first few of the rate equations , that each @xmath158 grows linearly in time .",

    "[ genealogy ] , the number @xmath169 of out - components with @xmath149 nodes equals @xmath170 , the number of nodes in generation @xmath171 in the genealogical tree .",
    "we therefore compute @xmath172 , the size of generation @xmath165 at time @xmath22 . for this discussion",
    ", we again treat only the constant attachment kernel and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more general attachment kernels .",

    "this occurs with rate @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the number of nodes .",

    "the genealogical tree therefore contains approximately @xmath182 generations at time @xmath22 .",
    "this result allows us to determine the diameter of the network , since the maximum distance between any pair of nodes is twice the distance from the root to the last generation .",
    "therefore the diameter of the network scales as @xmath183 ; this is the same dependence on @xmath184 as in the random graph @xcite .",
    "more importantly , this result shows that the diameter of the gn is always small  ranging from the order of @xmath185 for a constant attachment kernel , to the order of one for super - linear attachment kernels .",
    "in the world - wide web , link directionality is clearly relevant , as hyperlinks go _ from _ an issuing website _ to _ a target website but not vice versa .",
    "thus to characterize the local graph structure more fully , the node degree should be resolved into the _ in - degree _  the number of incoming links to a node , and the complementary _ out - degree _",

    "in addition to the degree distributions , current measurements indicate that the web consists of a `` giant '' component that contains approximately 91% of all nodes , and a large number of finite components @xcite .",
    "the models discussed thus far are unsuited to describe the number and size distribution of these components , since the growth rules necessarily produce only a single connected component . in this section",

    ", the rate equations now provide a comprehensive characterization for the size distribution of the components .    in the mg model , we simply separate node and link creation steps .",
    "namely , when a node is introduced it does not immediately attach to an earlier node , but rather , a new node begins its existence as isolated and joins the network only when a link creation event reaches the new node . for the average network degrees , this small modification already has a significant effect .",
    "the number of nodes and the total in- and out - degrees of the network , @xmath243 now increase with time as @xmath221 and @xmath244 .",
    "thus the in- and out - degrees of each node are time independent and equal to @xmath245 , while the total degree is @xmath246 .    as in the case of the wg model , we study the case of a bilinear link creation rate given in eq .",

    "the expressions ( [ inout ] ) are neater than their wg counterparts , reflecting the fact that the governing rules of the mg model are more symmetric .",
    "to complement our discussion , we now outline the asymptotic behavior of the joint in- and out - degree distribution .",
    "although this distribution defies general analysis , we can obtain partial and useful information by fixing one index and letting the other index vary .",
    "an elementary but cumbersome analysis yields following limiting behaviors @xmath252 with @xmath253    we also can determine the joint degree distribution analytically in the subset of the parameter space where @xmath254 , _",

    "let us now turn now to the distribution of connected components ( clusters , for brevity ) . for simplicity , we consider models with undirected links .",
    "let us first estimate the total number of clusters @xmath273 . at each time step , @xmath274 with probability @xmath8 , or @xmath275 with probability @xmath190 .",
    "this implies @xmath276 the gain rate of @xmath273 is exactly equal to @xmath8 , while in the loss term we ignore self - connections and tacitly assume that links are always created between different clusters . in the long - time limit , self - connections should be asymptotically negligible when the total number of clusters grows with time and no macroscopic clusters ( _ i.e. _ , components that contain a finite fraction of all nodes ) arise .",
    "this assumption of no self - connections greatly simplifies the description of the cluster merging process .",
    "consider two clusters ( labeled by @xmath277 ) with total in - degrees @xmath278 , out - degrees @xmath279 , and number of nodes @xmath280 .",
    "when these clusters merge , the combined cluster is characterized by @xmath281 thus starting with single - node clusters with @xmath282 , the above merging rule leads to clusters that always satisfy the constraint @xmath283 .",

    "( [ ac ] ) , with @xmath284 .",
    "then the merging rate @xmath285 of the two clusters is proportional to @xmath286 , or @xmath287 let @xmath288 denotes the number of clusters of mass @xmath0 .",
    "this distribution evolves according to @xmath289 the first set of terms account for the gain in @xmath288 due to the coalescence of clusters of size @xmath290 and @xmath291 , with @xmath292 .",
    "similarly , the second set of terms accounts for the loss in @xmath288 due to the coalescence of a cluster of size @xmath0 with any other cluster .",
    "the last term accounts for the input of unit - size clusters .",
    "these rate equations are similar to those of irreversible aggregation with product kernel @xcite .",
    "the primary difference is that we explicitly treat the number of clusters as finite .",
    "one can verify that the total number of nodes @xmath293 grows with rate @xmath8 and that the total number of clusters @xmath294 grows with rate @xmath295 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) . solving the first few eqs .",
    "( [ comp ] ) shows again that @xmath288 grow linearly with time .",
    "accordingly , we substitute @xmath296 into eqs .",

    "i.e. _ , a cluster that contains a finite fraction of all the nodes , emerges when the link creation rate exceeds a threshold value . to determine this threshold , we study the moments of the cluster size distribution @xmath298 .",
    "we already know that the first two moments are @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",

    "all clusters have finite size and the second moment is finite .    in this steady - state regime , we can obtain the cluster size distribution by introducing the generating function @xmath310 to convert eq .",
    "( [ mk ] ) into the differential equation @xmath311/q}.\\ ] ] the asymptotic behavior of the cluster size distribution can now be read off from the behavior of the generating function in the @xmath312 limit .",
    "in particular , the power - law behavior @xmath313 implies that the corresponding generating function has the form @xmath314 here the asymptotic behavior is controlled by the dominant singular term @xmath315",
    ". however , there are also subdominant singular terms and regular terms in the generating function . in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) we explicitly included the three regular terms which ensure that the first three moments of the cluster - size distribution are correctly reproduced , namely , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , and @xmath318 .    finally , substituting eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ cz ] ) we find that the dominant singular terms are of the order of @xmath319 .",
    "balancing all contributions of this order in the equation determines the exponent of the cluster size distribution to be @xmath320 this exponent satisfies the bound @xmath321 and thus justifies using the behavior of the second moment of the size distribution as the criterion to find the threshold value @xmath322 .    for @xmath323",
    "there is no giant cluster and the cluster size distribution has a power - law tail with @xmath324 given by eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) .",
    "intriguingly , the power - law form holds for any value @xmath309 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to all other percolation - type phenomena , where away from the threshold , there is an exponential tail in cluster size distributions @xcite .",
    "thus in contrast to ordinary critical phenomena , the entire range @xmath309 is critical .    as a corollary to the power - law tail of the cluster size distribution for @xmath309",
    ", we can estimate the size of the largest cluster @xmath325 to see how `` finite '' it really is . using the extreme statistics criterion",
    "@xmath326 we obtain @xmath327 , or @xmath328 this is very different from the corresponding behavior on the random graph , where below the percolation threshold the largest component scales logarithmically with the number of nodes .",
    "thus for the random graph , the dependence of @xmath329 changes from @xmath185 just below , to @xmath184 , just above the percolation threshold ; for the mg , the change is much more gentle : from @xmath330 to @xmath184 .",
    "these considerations suggest that the phase transition in the mg is dramatically different from the percolation transition . very recently",
    ", simplified versions of the mg were studied @xcite .",
    "numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite evidence suggest that the size of the giant component @xmath331 near the threshold scales as @xmath332 therefore , the phase transition of this dynamically grown network is of infinite order since all derivatives of @xmath331 vanish as @xmath333 . in contrast , static random graphs with any desired degree distribution @xcite exhibit a standard percolation transition @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a statistical physics viewpoint on growing network problems .",
    "this perspective is strongly influenced by the phenomenon of aggregation kinetics , where the rate equation approach has proved extremely useful . from the wide range of results that we were able to obtain for evolving networks , we hope that the reader appreciates both the simplicity and the power of the rate equation method for characterizing evolving networks .",
    "we quantified the degree distribution of the growing network model and found a diverse range of phenomenology that depends on the form of the attachment kernel . at the qualitative level , a stretched exponential form for the degree distribution",
    "should be regarded as `` generic '' , since it occurs for an attachment kernel that is sub - linear in node degree ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath44 with @xmath2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a power - law degree distribution arises only for linear attachment kernels , @xmath51 .",
    "however , this result is `` non - generic '' as the degree distribution exponent now depends on the detailed form of the attachment kernel .",
    "we investigated extensions of the basic growing network to incorporate processes that naturally occur in the development in the web .",
    "in particular , by allowing for link directionality , the full degree distribution naturally resolves into independent in - degree and out - degree distributions . when the rates at which links are created are linear functions of the in- and out - degrees of the terminal nodes of the link , the in- and out - degree distributions are power laws with different exponents , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , that match with current measurements on the web with reasonable values for the model parameters .",
    "we also considered a model with independent node and link creation rates .",
    "this leads to a network with many independent components and now the size distribution of these components is an important characteristic .",
    "we have characterized basic aspects of this process by the rate equation approach and showed that the network is in a critical state even away from the percolation threshold .",
    "the rate equation approach also provides evidence of an unusual , infinite - order percolation transition .    while statistical physics tools have fueled much progress in elucidating the structure of growing networks , there are still many open questions .",
    "one set is associated with understanding dynamical processes in such networks .",
    "for example , what is the nature of information transmission ? what governs the formation of traffic jams on the web ?",
    "another set is concerned with growth mechanisms . while we can make much progress in characterizing networks with idealized growth rules , it is important to understand the actual rules that govern the growth of the internet .",
