    "a large class of physical and engineering problems can be described in terms of lagrangian and hamiltonian systems , such as controlled mechanical systems , externally forced and dissipative systems , collisions , electric circuits , stochastic systems , and field theories such as electromagnetism and elasticity .",
    "such systems are usually categorized into lagrangian or hamiltonian systems with constraints , whether holonomic or nonholonomic ; however , one may be faced with serious problems on ever larger scales becoming more and more heterogeneous , involving a mixture of mechanical and electrical components , with flexible and rigid parts , and elastic or magnetic couplings ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "dirac structures are known as a powerful tool for providing a natural geometric framework for describing the structure of such diverse lagrangian and hamiltonian systems on the product of configuration spaces by introducing nontrivial constraints that model interactions between subsystems , which is called an _",
    "interconnection_. the notion of an interconnection was originally developed by @xcite in his book of `` diakoptics '' for modeling complicated physical systems .",
    "the word `` diakoptics '' denotes a procedure of _ tearing _ a dynamical system into disconnected subsystems as well as _ interconnecting _ them to reconstruct the original system .",
    "the original system may be regarded as an interconnected system of subsystems , with constraints induced from the interconnection .",
    "interconnection has been studied through the lens of power conservation motivated by the bond graph theory established by @xcite . in electric circuit theory , the interconnection network has been widely employed through nonenergic multiports ( see @xcite ) , where kirchhoff s current law gives a constraint distribution on a configuration charge space such that tellegen s theorem holds . in mechanics ,",
    "it was shown by @xcite that kinematical constraints due to mechanical joints , coordinate transformations as well as force equilibrium conditions in dalembert principle can be represented by the interconnection modeled by nonenergic multiports using the bond graph theory in the context of lagrangian mechanics .",
    "it was demonstrated by @xcite that the interconnection can be represented by dirac structures induced from poisson structures and also that nonholonomic systems and l - c circuits can be represented by _",
    "implicit hamiltonian systems_. on the lagrangian side , it was shown by @xcite that nonholonomic mechanical systems and l - c circuits ( as degenerate lagrangian systems ) can be formulated by _",
    "implicit lagrangian systems _ associated with the dirac structures on the cotangent bundles induced from given constraint distributions . from the view point of variational structures ,",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the standard implicit lagrangian systems , namely , _",
    "implicit euler - lagrange equations _ for unconstrained systems can be derived from the _ hamilton - pontryagin principle _ and also that the lagrange - dirac dynamical systems can be formulated in the context of _ lagrange - dalembert - pontryagin principle_.    from the viewpoint of control theory , a notion of _ implicit port - controlled hamiltonian ( ipch ) systems _ ( an implicit hamiltonian system with external control inputs ) was developed by @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and much effort has been devoted to the passivity based control for the interconnected mechanical systems ( @xcite ) . for the case of regular lagrangian systems , the equivalence between _ controlled lagrangian ( cl ) systems _ and _ controlled hamiltonian ( ch ) _ systems was shown by @xcite and the reduction theory for the cl systems was shown by @xcite . for the general case",
    "in which a given lagrangian is degenerate , an implicit lagrangian analogue of ipch systems , namely , a notion of _ implicit port - controlled lagrangian ( ipcl ) systems _ for electrical circuits was constructed by @xcite and @xcite , where it was shown that l - c transmission lines can be represented in the context of the iplc system by employing induced dirac structures with lagrange multipliers .",
    "recently , it was shown by @xcite that any power - conserving interconnection of ipch systems is another port - hamiltonian system , with the dirac structure being the _ composition _ of the dirac structures of its constituent parts , hamiltonian the sum of the hamiltonians , and resistive relations determined by the individual resistive relations .",
    "as a control application , the feedback interconnection of a plant port - hamiltonian system with a controller port - hamiltonian system can be represented by the composition of a plant dirac structure with a controller dirac structure .",
