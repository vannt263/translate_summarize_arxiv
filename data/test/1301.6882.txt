    "a particularly simple yet nontrivial example is given by the majorana fermion bound states that must be present near the ends of one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological superconductor wires ; for reviews , see refs .",
    "since majorana fermions exhibit non - abelian statistics , they are under consideration as platforms for topological quantum information processing . an experimental realization in terms of few - channel insb or inas nanowires was recently proposed @xcite , where the conspiracy of pronounced spin - orbit coupling , strong zeeman magnetic field , and proximity - induced pairing correlations inherited from an @xmath1-wave superconducting substrate , will induce the majorana end states .",
    "electron tunneling from a normal metal into such a 1d topological superconductor is predicted to show a zero - bias anomaly conductance peak due to resonant andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "in essence , the majorana state delocalizes into the normal metal and forms a resonance pinned to the fermi energy .",
    "this mechanism establishes a perfect andreev reflection channel , with conductance peak value @xmath5 at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "resonant andreev reflection is in fact the most important coupling mechanism in such a metal - majorana contact as long as the proximity - induced gap exceeds the thermal energy , @xmath7 , and the applied bias voltage scale , @xmath8 .",
    "all other local perturbations at the contact , e.g. , quasi - particle tunneling or potential scattering , were shown to be irrelevant compared to tunneling via the resonant majorana state @xcite .",
    "experimental reports of conductance peaks with such properties in inas or insb nanowires ( with proximity - induced pairing , strong spin - orbit coupling and appropriate zeeman fields ) have indeed appeared recently @xcite , possibly providing first experimental signatures for majoranas .",
    "other majorana platforms have also been discussed in the literature ; for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to usefully employ the nonlocal information stored in these majorana states",

    "we note in passing that regular 2d majorana networks , e.g. , with many superconducting grains connected by nanowires , can realize exotic spin models such as kitaev s toric code @xcite . in majorana junctions",
    ", the coupling between majoranas can either be due to direct tunnel matrix elements , which requires that nanowires are in close proximity to each other , or mediated through the capacitive coulomb charging energy @xcite . in this paper , we study the majorana junction shown schematically in fig .",

    "the setup in fig .  [ fig1 ] provokes the question whether one can observe even - odd parity effects in the tunneling conductance .",
    "for tunneling into a chain of majorana states @xcite , there indeed is a _ strong parity effect _ : the @xmath6 conductance exhibits the unitary zero - bias peak value @xmath9 for tunneling into a chain with odd number @xmath10 of coupled majoranas , while @xmath11 for even @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 zeros and @xmath10 peaks are present in the bias - dependent @xmath6 tunneling conductance @xmath13 @xcite . the strong parity effect is explained by noting that @xmath10 coupled majoranas , for even @xmath10 , correspond to @xmath14 finite - energy fermion states .",
    "the absence of a zero - energy state then implies a quenching of resonant andreev reflection , and hence @xmath11 . for odd @xmath10 ,",

    "we now offer an intuitive and general interpretation of our results for the linear tunneling conductance @xmath214 , where lead @xmath66 is connected to a set @xmath215 of coupled majorana fermions .",
    "every majorana fermion in the set @xmath215 is linked to other majoranas in this set through @xmath216 `` bonds '' , where a bond requires that the respective tunnel coupling is finite . in general , the set @xmath215 contains not only the @xmath217 but also additional majorana fermions @xmath218 corresponding to the normal parts ( leads ) .",
    "the @xmath219 are coupled only to @xmath3 by @xmath38 , see eq .",
    "( [ ham0 ] ) , with @xmath220 .",
    "we note in passing that within the bosonization approach , the @xmath219 represent klein factors for each lead @xcite . a majorana mode with @xmath221 ( but not @xmath222 )",
    "is called `` outer majorana fermion '' and , if present , constitutes a boundary of the set @xmath215 .",
    "the tunneling conductance @xmath70 then follows by summing over all propagation amplitudes for paths on @xmath215 connecting @xmath222 and outer majoranas , where a possible parity effect follows from the following rule : _ trajectories containing an odd ( even ) number of majoranas in the set @xmath215 yield a finite ( zero ) contribution to @xmath70 . _",
    "if @xmath215 has no boundary ( i.e. , no outer majoranas exist ) , @xmath70 is determined by the sum over all `` loop '' trajectories passing through @xmath197 .",
    "in particular , `` homogeneous loop '' trajectories do not contribute to @xmath70 , see our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec3b ] .",
    "we have verified this rule for the case of @xmath15 nanowires ( for arbitrary parameters ) in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] as well as for all the examples in sec .",
    "for instance , in the `` tree '' configuration , eq .",
    "( [ treelin ] ) shows that @xmath223 for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "since there are @xmath224 outer majoranas @xmath225 , each connected to @xmath222 through a chain of four majoranas , every path connecting @xmath222 and @xmath225 involves an odd number ( five ) of majoranas .",
    "( note that @xmath222 is not included in the set @xmath215 , and hence , in the majorana number , it should not be counted while the outer majorana @xmath225 counts . ) as a result , a finite conductance @xmath70 follows from the above rule . as another example , consider the `` ladder '' configuration with @xmath0 wires , where we also have @xmath224 outer majoranas @xmath226 . here , paths connecting @xmath222 and @xmath227 , for even @xmath228 , lead to an enhancement of @xmath70 , which can explain the reported peak _ vs. _  dip structure for even _ vs. _  odd @xmath0 .",
    "the present work has shown that rich parity effects are present in junctions of multiple majorana nanowires .",
    "for chain - like arrangements , the @xmath6 linear tunneling conductance is either zero ( for even number of majoranas ) or @xmath123 ( for odd number ) @xcite .",
    "such a strong parity effect does not survive for general junction topologies .",
    "for instance , in the `` ladder '' and `` isotropic '' topologies , see fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , one has only a `` weak parity effect '' , where non - ideal zero - bias dips and peaks can be observed in the tunneling conductance depending on the parity of the majorana number .",
    "however , these effects are less pronounced and disappear with increasing number of majoranas .",
    "in other configurations , e.g. , for the `` tree '' topology , there is no parity effect at all . a particularly noteworthy result concerns the tunneling conductance when @xmath197 is coupled to a `` majorana loop . '' for generic parameters , a strong parity effect is present for such a junction topology , with the even - odd features in the conductance as for a majorana chain .",
    "however , for a homogeneous loop ( and in some other special cases ) , the linear conductance is found to vanish for any number of majorana fermions in the loop , i.e. , no parity effect can be detected .",
    "finally , let us briefly address the role of finite - temperature effects and of coulomb interactions .",
    "finite @xmath229 implies a thermal broadening of all peak or dip features in the differential conductance , plus a reduction of the peaks .",
    "once @xmath229 reaches the energy scale corresponding to the separation between two adjacent peaks in @xmath13 , peaks start to overlap and the parity effects described here will be smeared out .",
    "concerning coulomb interactions , it has recently been pointed out that charging effects cause interesting kondo physics in similar majorana networks @xcite .",
    "this physics is different from the parity effects studied here , and it would be interesting to study their interplay with kondo physics for finite charging energy .    we acknowledge support by the dfg within the research networks sfb tr 12 and spp 1666 , and by the ministry of science , technology and innovation of brazil .",
    "here we briefly sketch the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ gret ] ) , obtained by solving the combined equations of motion for majoranas and lead fermions , @xmath230 @xmath231 the retarded green s function is contained in the general keldysh green s function @xmath232 where @xmath233 denotes time ordering along the standard keldysh contour @xcite . exploiting the wide - band approximation for the leads , some algebra yields the dyson equation for @xmath234 from the above equations of motion",
    ", @xmath235 the @xmath56 structure refers to @xmath24 space .",
    "in addition , every matrix entry still carries the standard @xmath56 keldysh substructure @xcite , @xmath236 , where @xmath237^\\dagger$ ] and the keldysh component is @xmath238 .",
    "the keldysh structure of the self - energy @xmath239 due to the lead fermions is @xmath240 where @xmath241 . noting that @xmath16 and @xmath242 are diagonal matrices in keldysh space , it is then straightforward to extract the @xmath55 matrix for the retarded green s function @xmath54 quoted in eq .",
    "( [ gret ] ) .      here we show how to derive the quantity @xmath243 quoted in eq .",
    "( [ condiso ] ) for the isotropic topology in sec .",
    "[ sec4c ] .",
    "first , it is useful to define auxiliary variables @xmath244 for @xmath245 , with @xmath246 . the dyson equation for @xmath86 ,",
