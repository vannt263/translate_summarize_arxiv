    "recent successful observation of degenerate boson - fermion mixture ( dbfm ) of trapped alkali - metal atoms by different experimental groups @xcite initiated intensive experimental studies of different novel phenomena @xcite . among these experiments , apart from the study of dbfm @xmath1li @xcite , @xmath2na-@xmath3li @xcite and @xmath4rb-@xmath5k @xcite , there have been studies of degenerate fermion - fermion mixtures ( dffm ) of two components of @xmath5k @xcite and @xmath3li @xcite .",
    "the collapse in a dbfm of @xmath4rb-@xmath5k atoms has been observed @xcite and studied @xcite by modugno _",
    "et al . _ and by the present author @xcite and more recently by ospelkaus _",
    "there have also been investigations on the formation of bright @xcite and dark @xcite solitons in a dbfm .",
    "several theoretical investigations @xcite of a trapped dbfm studied the phenomenon of mixing - demixing when the boson - fermion repulsion is increased . for a weak boson - fermion repulsion at 0",
    "k both the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and the degenerate fermi gas ( dfg ) have maxima of probability density at the center of the harmonic trap .",
    "however , with the increase of boson - fermion repulsion , the maximum of the probability density of the dfg could be slowly expelled from the central region . with further increase of boson - fermion repulsion",
    ", the dfg could be completely expelled from the central region which will house only the bec .",
    "this phenomenon has been termed mixing - demixing in a dbfm .",
    "the phenomenon of demixing has drawn some attention lately as in a demixed state an exotic configuration of the mixture is formed , where there is practically no overlap between the two components and one can be observed and studied independent of the other .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that such a demixed state in dbfm should be possible experimentally by increasing the interspecies scattering length near a feshbach resonance . in view of this",
    "it is of interest to see if , in addition to a dbfm , such a demixed state appears in a dffm .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study and illustrate this mixing - demixing phenomenon in a trapped dffm using a coupled time - dependent mean - field - hydrodynamic model inspired by the success of a similar model in the investigation of fermionic collapse @xcite and bright @xcite and dark @xcite solitons in a dbfm .",
    "the conclusions of the study on bright soliton @xcite are in agreement with a microscopic study @xcite , and those on collapse @xcite are in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "there have been prior suggestions of mixing - demixing in a trapped dffm upon an increase of interspecies repulsion .",
    "roth and feldmeier @xcite discuss the possibility of demixing mathematically using a energy density functional approach .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrate demixing numerically using model hydrodynamic flow equations .",
    "in contrast to these previous time - independent studies for stationary states , the present study relies on a time - dependent formulation and demonstrates demixing also for an increase of the trapping frequencies and should be considered complimentary to these previous investigations .",
    "the present suggestion of demixing with an increase of trapping frequency is easier to implement experimentally than increasing the interspecies scattering length using a feshbach resonance .",
    "we look for mixing - demixing in a trapped dffm in the spherically - symmetric as well as quasi - one - dimensional configurations . for a weak fermion - fermion repulsion",
    ", we find the formation of a fully mixed state with both the fermion clouds occupying the central region of the trap .",
    "if the fermion numbers of the two types of fermions are largely different , a fully demixed state of dffm appears with the increase of fermion - fermion repulsion , when the component with smaller number of fermions is completely expelled from the central region of the trap which is occupied only by the component with the larger number of fermions .",
    "this demixing also appears for increasing trap frequencies which increases the fermion density and hence fermion - fermion repulsion thus resulting in a demixing . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first study of mixing - demixing in a dffm using a time - dependent formulation capable of investigating nonequilibrium states .",
    "previous studies of demixing @xcite employed time - independent formulations appropriate for stationary states only .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the mean - field - hydrodynamic model we use in our investigation in the spherically - symmetric as well as quasi - one - dimensional configuration .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "iii where we illustrate demixing with the increase of interspecies repulsion and of the harmonic trapping potential . finally , in sec .",
    "iii a brief summary of our findings are given .",
    "a proper description of a dffm should employ @xcite a fully antisymmetrized microscopic slater determinant wave function for each component .",
    "however , a simplified mean - field - hydrodynamic lagrangian for a dfg has been used successfully to study a dbfm @xcite , which we shall use in the present investigation .",
    "the virtue of the mean - field model over a microscopic description is its simplicity and good predictive power . to develop a set of practical time - dependent mean - field - hydrodynamic equations for a dffm , we consider the following lagrangian density @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of component @xmath8 , @xmath9 a complex probability amplitude , @xmath10 the real probability density , @xmath11 the number , @xmath12 @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the confining trap . here",
    "the interspecies coupling is @xmath15 with the reduced mass @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the interspecies scattering length .",
    "the interaction between intra - species fermions in spin - polarized state is highly suppressed due to pauli blocking term @xmath18 and has been neglected in eq .",
    "( [ yy ] ) and will be neglected throughout .",
    "the kinetic energy terms in this equation @xmath19 are derived from a hydrodynamic equation for the fermions @xcite and contribute little to this problem compared to the dominating pauli blocking term in eq .",
    "( [ yy ] ) . however , the inclusion of the kinetic energy terms in eq .",
    "( [ yy ] ) leads to a smooth solution for the probability density everywhere @xcite . to keep the algebra simple and without losing generality in our calculation",
