    "on march 11 , 2011 , reactors at the fukushima dai - ichi nuclear power plant in japan ( 37@xmath145 n , 141@xmath127 e ) were shut down following a 9.0 magnitude earthquake .",
    "emergency diesel generators were activated to power water pumps needed to cool the reactors and prevent intensely radioactive nuclear fuel from overheating and damaging the reactor containment vessels . shortly after the earthquake , the plant was struck by a 14-m tsunami which flooded the electrical building , disabling the emergency generators  @xcite .",
    "fires , explosions and possible partial core meltdowns released radioactive fission products into the atmosphere . on april 20 , 2011 , the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) reported ^131^i deposition in japan ranging from 1.8 to 368 bq / m^2^ in 13 prefectures and ^137^cs deposition ranging from 2.4 to 160 bq / m^2^ in seven prefectures  @xcite .    uncertainty surrounded the development of the situation at fukushima as plant staff struggled to restore power and to adequately cool the reactors . a limited amount of information and measurements relevant to the release of radioactive material had been available .",
    "considering global interest in possible public health effects and local impact on our physics program that relies on ultra - low radioactive background detectors , we began collecting airborne particle samples and monitoring for fission products on march 17 , 2011 .",
    "airborne fission products , including ^131,132^i , ^134,137^cs , ^132^te and ^133^xe were first detected on the west coast of the united states on march 16 , 2011 , and reached a maximum activity concentration of 4.4 @xmath0 1.3 mbq / m^3^ of ^131^i 3 d after the first detection of fission products  @xcite .",
    "radioactivity has also been measured in europe  @xcite , western japan  @xcite , russia  @xcite , in rainwater in the united states  @xcite and is continuously monitored in france  @xcite .",
    "we first detected airborne fission products in chapel hill between 20:00 utc on march 18 , 2011 , and 20:00 utc on march 19 , 2011 .",
    "we measured a maximum activity concentration of 4.2 @xmath0 0.6 mbq / m^3^ of ^131^i in the interval between march 29 , 2011 and march 30 , 2011 .",
    "the time dependence of ^131^i and ^137^cs activity seems to have been dominated by local rain , but we are able to draw some conclusions about the nature of the reactor accident and the transport of fission products around the world .",
    "the air sampling pump and filter were housed on the roof of phillips hall at the university of north carolina at chapel hill ( 35@xmath155n , 79@xmath12 w , 150 m elevation ) .",
    "the pump is a staplex model tfia 110 - 125 v dc / ac with built - in flow meter and an 8  @xmath2 10  filter holder assembly @xcite . with a filter in place",
    ", the flow rate of the air sampler was measured to be 2050 m^3^/d .",
    "air filters collected airborne particles for approximately 24 h , then were removed , folded into 5 cm @xmath2 10 cm rectangles and sealed in nylon bags .",
    "a total of 38 air filters were collected over 62 d following the march 11 , 2011 earthquake .",
    "two 5% relative efficiency to nai ( r.e . )",
    "high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors were used to identify characteristic gamma rays from radioactive fission products .",
    "the detectors were setup horizontally with a 10 mm separation between their end caps .",
    "bagged filters were placed between the end caps of the detectors for assay .",
    "the detectors were surrounded by a lead shield of 5 - 10 cm thickness to reduce backgrounds from cosmic rays and natural radiation .",
    "ten filters which had already been measured using the setup described above were assayed at the kimballton underground research facility ( kurf ) in order to search for more exotic , long - lived fission products .",
    "kurf is located in the kimballton mine near ripplemead , va , which provides shielding equivalent to 1450 m of water from cosmic - ray induced backgrounds .",
    "the detectors in this counting facility have a background rate about 40 times less than the above - ground detectors in the region of 40  2700 kev .",
    "all 10 filters were tightly fit into a marinelli beaker and were assayed simultaneously in the ` vt-1 ' detector which is a 35% r.e .",
    "coaxial hpge detector with very low background ( ortec llb ) . for technical specifications on the counting systems and facility see  @xcite .",
    "a single filter was also measured using the vt-1 detector to determine the gamma - ray detection efficiency of the surface based counting system .",
    "the efficiency of the vt-1 detector had previously been determined using an existing monte carlo simulation that had been calibrated using point sources of known activity spanning wide gamma - ray energy range in multiple locations surrounding the detector .",
    "the detection efficiencies of the above - ground detectors were determined by comparing ^131^i and ^137^cs count rates to vt-1 measurements of the same filter .",
    "the relative efficiencies were also verified by comparing the efficiency of a ^133^ba ( e@xmath3 = 356 kev ) point source on the top of the cryostat of the vt-1 detector to a similar source of known activity in the same position on the cryostats of the above - ground detectors .    to determine the filter efficiency for air particles containing ^131^i and ^137^cs , two filters were placed in the air sampler in series and the activities of the two filters were compared . using this method ,",
    "the filter efficiency for particles carrying ^131^i was determined to be 87% @xmath0 5% .",
    "the filter efficiency for air particles containing ^137^cs was determined to be 98.7% @xmath0 0.6% .",
    "the manufacturer quotes a filter efficiency of 99.98% for particles down to 0.3 @xmath4 m @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the measured ^131^i only represents particulate species collected in the air filters .",
    "this accounts for only about 50% of the total ^131^i in the air .",
    "the rest is distributed in gases such as i@xmath5 and methyl iodide @xcite .",
    "the particulate activity concentration from a given isotope can be calculated as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the absolute gamma - ray detection efficiency , @xmath8 is the air filter efficiency , @xmath9 is the flow rate of the air sampler , t@xmath10 is the time duration of air sampling and @xmath11 is the count rate of the filter at the end of the sampling period .",
    "@xmath11 has been corrected for any delay between sampling and counting using the known lifetimes of the relevant isotopes .",
    "we did not correct for decays during the sampling period .",
    "the first filter was placed in the air sampler on march 17 , 2011 , and collected particles for 24 h. although there are many nuclear facilities in the united states including the shearon harris nuclear power plant about 30 km from the sampling site  @xcite , no fission products were detected in this filter and all visible gamma - ray peaks could be attributed to known background sources .",
    "filters from subsequent days produced clear peaks attributable to ^131^i and ^137^cs as seen in fig .",

    "if the release of radioactivity was from a nuclear weapon , for example , there would be almost no ^134^cs produced because the formation of ^134^cs via neutron capture on ^133^cs is strongly dependent on the length of criticality .",
    "the atomic ratio of ^134^cs to ^137^cs was found to be 0.070 @xmath0 0.001 , and is consistent with a nuclear reactor accident and not a nuclear weapons test , as expected .",
    "the ratio of ^131^i to ^137^cs activity from a measurement of seawater samples from the south discharge channel , a monitoring post located 330 m south of the discharge channel of the unit 1 - 4 reactor sites was investigated by  @xcite .",
    "the data were described by fitting to an exponential function . the measured ratio of of ^131^i to ^137^cs activity from data in the current work are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idivcs ] .",
    "an attempt was made to fit these data to the same exponential function :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fractions of ^131^i and ^137^cs per fission ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively  @xcite ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the lifetimes of ^131^i and ^137^cs and @xmath21 is the length of time the reactor has been active . we assume the lifetime of ^131^i is short compared to the reactor operation time , the decay constant is fixed and @xmath21 is the only free parameter .",
    "the best fit value for @xmath21 was found to be 2.6 @xmath0 0.2 y which is not in good agreement with @xmath21 = 1 y reported by  @xcite .",
    "the data show large deviations from the fit ( @xmath22/dof = 4.4 , @xmath23 = @xmath24 ) which may indicate a difference in the particulate transport mechanisms and efficiencies of the iodine and cesium isotopes .",
    "airborne fission products released from the fukushima dai - ichi reactor have been measured in chapel hill , nc , usa . fallout from the reactor accident is not expected to have any health implications for the people living in north carolina or in the united states . the maximum measured ^131^i activity concentration is below limits set by the epa and nrc as well as many sources of natural background radiation , including radon .",
    "after april 20 , 2011 , the radioactivity in the air fell below our detection limits .",
