    "from the atmospheric and solar neutrino data , there is increasing evidence for neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "if this is a correct interpretation , the standard model ( sm ) has to be extended to incorporate the small masses of the neutrinos suggested by data .",
    "there have been several ideas proposed in literature to generate small neutrino masses .",
    "the zee - model is one of such attempts@xcite . in this model ,",
    "all flavor neutrinos are massless at the tree level , and their small masses are induced radiatively through one - loop diagrams .",
    "for such a mass - generation mechanism to work , it is necessary to extend the higgs sector of the sm to contain at least two weak - doublet fields and one weak - singlet charged scalar field .",
    "although some studies have been done to examine the interaction of the leptons and the higgs bosons in the zee - model@xcite , the scalar ( higgs ) sector of the model remains unexplored in detail . in this paper",
    "we study the higgs sector of the zee - model to clarify its impact on the higgs search experiments , either at the cern lep - ii , the run - ii of the fermilab tevatron , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , or future linear colliders ( lc s ) .",
    "experimental search for the higgs boson has been continued at the cern lep and the fermilab tevatron experiments . in the lep - ii experiments ,",
    "the higgs boson with the mass less than about 110 gev has been excluded if its production cross section and decay modes are similar to those of the sm higgs boson@xcite .",
    "run - ii of the tevatron can be sensitive to a sm - like higgs boson with the mass up to about 180 gev , provided that the integrated luminosity of the collider is large enough ( about @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the primary goal of the cern lhc experiments is to guarantee the discovery of a sm - like higgs boson for its mass as large as about 1 tev@xcite , which is the upper bound of the sm higgs boson mass .",
    "( for a higgs boson mass beyond this value , the sm is no longer a consistent low energy theory . )",
    "when the higgs boson is discovered , its mass and various decay properties will be measured to test the sm and to distinguish models of new physics at high energy scales .",
    "for example , the allowed mass range of the lightest cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) can be determined by demanding the considered theory to be a valid effective theory all the way up to some cut - off energy scale ( @xmath3 ) . for @xmath4 gev ( i.e. , the planck scale ) ,",
    "the lower and upper bounds of the sm higgs boson masses are 137 gev and 175 gev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass bounds for the two - higgs - doublet - model ( thdm ) were also investigated@xcite with and without including the soft - breaking term with respect to the discrete symmetry that protects the natural flavor conservation .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the lower bound of the lightest cp - even higgs boson is about 100 gev in the decoupling regime where only one neutral higgs boson is light as compared to the other physical states of higgs bosons .",
    "the higgs sector of the zee - model is similar to that of the thdm except for the existence of an additional weak - singlet charged higgs field , so that the physical scalar bosons include two cp - even , one cp - odd and two pairs of charged higgs bosons . in this paper , we shall first determine the upper and lower bounds for the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass ( @xmath5 ) as a function of the cut - off scale @xmath6 of the zee - model , using renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "we show that the upper and lower mass bounds for @xmath0 are almost the same as those in the thdm .",
    "we also study the possible range of the higgs - boson self - coupling constants at the electroweak scale as a function of @xmath6 . by using these results ,",
    "we examine effects of the additional loop contribution of the singlet charged higgs boson to the partial decay width of @xmath7 .",
    "we show that , by taking @xmath8 gev , the deviation of the decay width from the sm prediction can be about @xmath920% or nearly @xmath1010% for @xmath11 between 125 gev and 140 gev when the mass of the isospin singlet charged higgs boson is taken to be around 100 gev .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation becomes larger for lower cutoff scales and smaller masses of the singlet charged higgs boson .",
    "if we choose @xmath12 gev and the singlet charged higgs boson mass to be 100 gev , the positive deviation can be greater than @xmath1030% ( @xmath1040% ) for @xmath13 gev ( @xmath14 gev ) .",
    "such a deviation from the sm prediction could be tested at the lhc , the @xmath15 lc and the @xmath16 option of lc@xcite .",
    "we also discuss phenomenology of the singlet charged higgs boson at present and future collider experiments , which is found to be completely different from that of the ordinary thdm - like charged higgs bosons .",
    "to detect such a charged higgs boson at lep - ii experiments , experimentalists have to search for their data sample with @xmath17 or @xmath18 plus missing energy , in contrast to the usual detection channels : either @xmath19 or @xmath20 decay modes .",

    "<S> to generate small neutrino masses radiatively , the zee - model introduces two higgs doublets and one weak - singlet charged higgs boson to its higgs sector . from analyzing the renormalization group equations , we determine the possible range of the lightest cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) mass and the higgs boson self - couplings as a function of the cut - off scale beyond which either some of the coupling constants are strong enough to invalidate the perturbative analysis or the stability of the electroweak vacuum is no longer guaranteed . using the results obtained from the above analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the singlet charged higgs boson can significantly modify the partial decay width of @xmath1 via radiative corrections , and its collider phenomenology can also be drastically different from that of the charged higgs bosons in the usual two - higgs - doublet models .    </S>",
