    "a copious amount of heavy quarks produced in two - photon collisions will be generated at high energy @xmath0 colliders such as lep2 and a future next linear collider ( nlc ) .",
    "the largest fraction of these will come from so - called no - tag events , in which neither of the leptons generating the photons is seen .",
    "however , due to the high energy and luminosity of these machines , a sizeable number of them will be produced in events where either the outgoing @xmath6 or @xmath7 is tagged ( `` single - tag events '' ) . in such events , the photon coming from the tagged lepton",
    "is far off - shell and spacelike , hence this reaction amounts to deeply inelastic electroproduction of heavy quarks on a photon target . an important aspect of on - shell photons initiating a hard scattering is that they may behave either as pointlike particles ( `` direct '' process ) , or as hadronic ( vector ) particles ( `` resolved '' process ) @xcite . in no - tag",
    "events , both the direct and resolved process contribute to the cross section . at lep2",
    "they contribute in about equal amounts to the cross section for charm production in two - photon collisions @xcite . in such events one can separate these components by making use of forward detectors and using the presence of a remnant jet of spectator partons in resolved processes as a separator @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of single - tag heavy - quark events is that this separation occurs quite naturally in the deeply inelastic bjorken scaling variable @xmath4 , as we will show below .",
    "moreover , the presence of the heavy quark mass ensures that this separation is unambiguous to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd .",
    "the direct process is directly calculable in qcd and is free from such phenomenological inputs as parton densities in the photon .",
    "the resolved channel on the other hand is directly proportional to the poorly known gluon density in the photon .",
    "therefore a reasonable sample of single - tag heavy - quark events allows one to confront simultaneously a well - controlled perturbative qcd calculation with experiment , and constrain the gluon density in the photon .    in the past ( open )",
    "heavy quark ( mainly charm ) production in two - photon collisions at @xmath0 colliders has been difficult to observe in experiments due to the low charm acceptance .",
    "the reaction @xmath8 has been thoroughly studied experimentally .",
    "the existence of the @xmath9 has been inferred either from direct reconstruction @xcite or from unfolding the distribution of soft pions @xcite resulting from its decay .",
    "in addition , measurements have been made using soft leptons @xcite and kaons @xcite to tag the charm .",
    "jade @xcite and tpc / two - gamma  @xcite have performed experimental studies of the reaction @xmath8 with one outgoing lepton tagged at low average value @xmath10 of the momentum transfer squared of the tagged lepton ( below @xmath11 ) .",
    "topaz  @xcite has performed a study as well at somewhat larger @xmath12 . the total number of events obtained was however very small ( about 30 for topaz ) .",
    "see @xcite for a more extensive review of the experimental situation .",
    "the cross section and single particle distributions for @xmath13 have been calculated to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd in @xcite , and agree with experimental results .",
    "correlations in the direct channel were studied in @xcite . for the single - tag case ,",
    "the structure functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 for charm production were calculated to nlo in qcd in @xcite . in this letter",
    "we employ the results of @xcite to estimate the expected number of single - tag events in @xmath5 bins for lep2 and a nlc , and examine differential distributions in the transverse momentum and rapidity of the charm quark .    in section 2",
    "we describe the formalism and explain our notation . in section 3",
    "we show the structure function @xmath14 for charm production , give estimates of event rates in @xmath5 bins for the case of lep2 and a nlc and show single - charm - quark differential distributions .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 4 .",
    "we consider the reaction ( see fig.1 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a heavy quark with momentum @xmath18 and @xmath19 denotes any hadronic state allowed by quantum - number conservation laws .    when the outgoing electron is tagged , this reaction is dominated by the subprocess @xmath20 where one of the photons is highly virtual and the other is almost on - mass - shell and transversely polarized . the case where the positron is tagged is completely equivalent .",
    "this process is described by the differential cross section @xmath21\\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath22 @xmath23 denote the ( doubly differential ) deeply inelastic photon structure functions , @xmath24 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath25 the heavy quark mass .",
    "@xmath26 is the center of mass energy squared of the @xmath27 system . the bjorken scaling variables @xmath4 and @xmath28 are defined by @xmath29 further , we define the variables @xmath30 the momenta of the off - shell photon and the on - shell photon obey the relations @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . because the photon with momentum @xmath33 is almost on - mass - shell ,",
    "( 3 ) is written in the weizscker - williams approximation : the function @xmath34 represents the probability of finding a photon @xmath35 in the positron , with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath36 .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the lepton beam energy and @xmath41 is the anti - tag angle . in the rest of the calculation @xmath42 .    in eq .",
    "( 3 ) the differential structure functions can be represented as @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the two terms represent the contributions to the structure functions from pointlike ( or `` direct '' ) and hadronic ( or `` resolved '' ) photons , respectively .",
    "the @xmath47 are photonic parton densities and the @xmath48 are ( differential ) wilson coefficient functions , and @xmath49 is the mass factorization scale . at lowest order , only the photonic gluon density appears in eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) . @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 were calculated in @xcite to nlo in qcd by computing all @xmath50 corrections to the coefficient functions @xmath51 .",
    "we use the results of this calculation for the present analysis . coupling constant renormalization",
    "was performed in the @xmath52 scheme , modified such that heavy flavours decouple in loops when small momenta flow into the fermion loop , and mass renormalization in the on - shell scheme .",
    "mass factorization was also performed in the @xmath52 scheme .",
    "see @xcite for further details . note the absence of the scale @xmath49 in the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , through nlo , the heavy quark mass prevents a collinear singularity from occurring in the pointlike piece . for massless quarks this singularity",
    "is subtracted at scale @xmath49 and absorbed into the hadronic piece . as a consequence @xmath53 is calculable",
    " the only theoretical uncertainties stemming from @xmath54 and the heavy quark mass whereas @xmath55 is primarily sensitive to the gluon density in the photon , in analogy to the proton case .",
    "we will see that the two components on the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) dominate in different regions of the bjorken variable @xmath4 . > from eq .",
    "( 3 ) we will estimate the numbers of events expected per @xmath5 bin at lep2 and a future nlc .    in analyzing charm production",
    ", we will also show differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity of the detected charm quark in the @xmath56 c.m .",
    "these quantities are derived from the variables defined in the above as follows .",
    "we define @xmath57 to be the invariant mass squared @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the transverse mass of the heavy quark in the @xmath60 frame is determined by @xmath61 the transverse mass is the same in the @xmath56 frame .",
    "further , in the @xmath60 frame the energy of the heavy quark is @xmath62 its longitudinal momentum can be found from the condition @xmath63 , so its rapidity in the @xmath60 frame is @xmath64 in the @xmath56 frame , @xmath65 ( we define a particle to have positive rapidity when it travels into the hemisphere from which the @xmath66 originates ) .",
    "8.5 cm    we first list our choices for various quantities used in the calculations of this section .",
    "deviations from them will be explicitly indicated .",
    "we used for @xmath25 , the heavy quark mass , the value @xmath67 gev for charm and @xmath68 gev for bottom .",
    "we assumed a center of mass energy @xmath69 ( 500 ) gev for lep2 ( nlc ) .",
    "for the strong coupling we took a one - loop running @xmath54 with three ( four ) light flavours and @xmath70 ( 200 ) mev at lo and a two - loop running @xmath54 with @xmath71 ( 200 ) mev at nlo for charm ( bottom ) .",
    "we put the renormalization scale equal to the factorization @xmath49 and chose @xmath72 .",
    "we also imposed the following requirements on the angle and energy of the tagged lepton : @xmath73 for lep2 ( nlc ) and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "these cuts imply a minimum @xmath76 of 3.65 @xmath77 for lep2 and 50 @xmath77 at our hypothetical nlc .",
    "furthermore we used the grv @xcite parton densities for the hadronic photon results , and the weizscker - williams density of @xcite with a @xmath78 for the equivalent target photon spectrum . for the total integrated luminosity of lep2 ( nlc ) we used @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) . at a nlc",
    ", beamstrahlung effects are expected to play an important rle .",
    "we include them here by adopting for its spectrum the expression given in @xcite , with parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 mm @xcite , corresponding to the tesla design .",
    "when showing differential distributions we will show them from the point of view of the @xmath83 cm frame , _",
    "i.e. _ we assume here that the electron is tagged and take the case where the positron is tagged into account by multiplying the results with a factor 2 .",
    "we begin by showing in fig.2 the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath85 versus @xmath4 both at lo and nlo , for @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath50 corrections to both quantities are for the most part fairly small in the @xmath4-region shown .",
    "we may therefore assume that even higher order contributions are negligible , and these components are thus calculated with some accuracy .",
    "the prominent feature in these figures is clearly the separation in @xmath4 of the components .",
    "this fact was already noted in @xcite , and we emphasize it here . as a result , the opportunity to confront a precise calculation and measure the small-@xmath4 photonic gluon density presents itself in one experiment . as mentioned earlier , the difficulty of efficient charm tagging makes such an experimental study very difficult in practice . to judge the feasibility of such a study we have integrated eq .",
    "( 3 ) for various @xmath5 bins , and obtained estimates for the number of charm quarks per bin produced at lep2 and nlc by both hadronic and pointlike photons . note that these estimates use the nlo calculation .    to perform the integrals over @xmath4 and @xmath76 , we used fitted versions of the _ integrated _ nlo coefficient functions @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) , as the actual expressions in @xcite are too long for fast evaluation . by adapting the fitted coefficient functions of electroproduction of heavy quarks on a proton target @xcite to the photon target",
    ", we were able to speed up our computer program by as much as a factor of fifty .",
    "the results for lep2 are shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we give in these tables the expected number of events due to pointlike ( table 1 ) and hadronic ( table 2 ) photons . assuming a charm tagging efficiency of 1 - 2% , we that on average a few tens of events per bin should be observable for larger @xmath4 values .",
    "furthermore , to test the stability of the results we varied the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath49 from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "the results change relatively little under these variations , as seen in tables 1 and 2 . for these lep2 conditions",
    ", we varied in addition the charm quark mass from @xmath90 gev to @xmath91 gev and found that the pointlike contribution ( table 1 ) changed under this variation in the charm mass by less than 10% in all bins , except in the @xmath4 bins @xmath92 . in these bins , the mass variation causes a variation in the position of the charm quark production threshold , and from the shape of @xmath84 in fig.2 one may readily understand that this causes a large change in the number of events , as much as 70% in the lowest @xmath76 bin .",
    "the sensitivity of the hadronic contribution ( table 2 ) to these changes is much more uniform in @xmath4 , varying from 30 - 40% in the lowest @xmath76 bin to 10 - 20% in the higher @xmath76 bins .    in table 3",
    "we give similar estimates for the nlc , both for charm and bottom production . here",
    "we have summed the contributions due to pointlike and hadronic photons for each entry .",
    "we do however show separately the number of events due to beamstrahlung and weizscker - williams bremsstrahlung contributions .",
    "note that the number of charmed events here is truly large , even at large @xmath76 .",
    "the number of events containing bottom quarks is much smaller due to charge and phase space suppression .",
    "clearly the production rate of charm quarks produced by hadronic photons is too small at lep2 to be useful for a good measurement of the gluon density in the photon . at a nlc",
    "the rates are significantly higher however .",
    "we therefore give in table 4 the production rate for a nlc in @xmath5 bins for various choices of parton densities , charm quark mass values and mass factorization scales .",
    "examining the composition of these results , we find very little contribution due to the hadronic channel from beamstrahlung photons ( about 1 - 2% ) .",
    "we further find the contributions due to pointlike photons both of ww and beamstrahlung origin to be similarly small .",
    "there is therefore a good possibility of measuring the gluon density in the photon at a nlc , poor tagging efficiency notwithstanding .",
    "the most significant uncertainty is related to the charm quark mass , however a differentiation of the gluon densities of grv @xcite and acfgp @xcite seems certainly feasible .",
    "while bottom quark production lends itself to considerably better tagging efficiencies , the production rate is severely suppressed relative to charm .",
    "an analysis similar to the one for charm reveals that a measurement of the photonic gluon density from bottom production in @xmath1 scattering does not seem possible at a nlc .",
    "we turn to single particle inclusive differential distributions in transverse momentum ( @xmath93 ) and rapidity ( @xmath28 ) of the heavy quark in the @xmath56 c.m . frame . due to the low rate of bottom quark production",
    "we only show these distributions for the case of charm .",
    "we integrate @xmath4 and @xmath76 over the intervals @xmath94 and @xmath95 gev@xmath96 for lep2 ( nlc ) . to approximate detector limitations",
    ", we use the restrictions @xmath97 gev and @xmath98 , in addition to the cuts listed in the beginning of this section .",
    "the @xmath93 restriction is of course quite loose , but it allows us to study the behavior of the @xmath93 spectrum at low @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , for the results shown in figs.3 and 4 we took the factorization ( = renormalization ) scale @xmath99 .",
    "8.5 cm    in fig.3a we present for lep2 the lo and nlo @xmath93-distributions of the charm quark for the pointlike and hadronic piece separately . in neither instance",
    "do the lo and nlo curves differ significantly .",
    "while the hadronic piece at nlo is larger than the lo at large @xmath93 ( which is similar to what was found for a proton target in @xcite ) , the reverse is true for the pointlike piece .",
    "the bulk of the events has @xmath100 gev . in fig.3b",
    "the same is shown but now for the rapidity distribution .",
    "clearly the charm quark has predominantly negative rapidity .    in figs.4a and 4b",
    "we present for the nlc the @xmath93 spectrum results due to pointlike and hadronic photons for a weizscker - williams spectrum and a beamstrahlung photon spectrum .",
    "both spectra lead to similar plots as for lep2 in fig.3a .",
    "the dominance near small @xmath93 of the beamstrahlung piece is due to the small final - state invariant mass preferred by the beamstrahlung spectrum .",
    "we have argued in this letter that a measurement of the cross section for heavy quark production in single - tag two - photon events is interesting , because it enables one to compare a well - controlled qcd calculation with data at large @xmath4 and constrain the gluon content of the photon at small @xmath4 .      assuming a not overly pessimistic charm acceptance",
    ", a measurement of the pointlike structure function seems feasible at lep2 , and both the pointlike and hadronic structure functions are certainly measurable at a future nlc .",
