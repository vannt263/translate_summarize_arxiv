    "there has been a growing interest in semiconductor nanowires  @xcite for their potential use in future nanoelectronic applications , such as nanocontacts and nanoswitches .",
    "silicon nanowires  ( sinws ) are especially attractive for their possible efficient integration in conventional si - based microelectronics .",
    "the use of sinws as chemical sensors has also been demonstrated .",
    "sinw - based sensors for the detection of nh@xmath1  @xcite , of biological macromolecules  @xcite and for the identification of complementary vs. mismatched dna  @xcite have been reported .",
    "experimentally , sinws are grown from a nanocrystal  @xcite which is used as a seed to direct the one - dimensional crystallisation of silicon .",
    "the ( typically gold ) nanocluster serves as the critical point for nucleation and enables the addition of reactants that allow the growth , determining the nanowire diameter and orientation .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite achieved the thinnest sinws reported so far , with diameters as small as 1.3  nm for a wire grown along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "a few other groups  @xcite also obtained sinws with diameters below 10  nm and growth orientations including @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensionality is known to induce a gap broadening effect , due to quantum confinement , in h - passivated sinws  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore on theoretical grounds the electronic structure of sinws when the lateral surface is left free to reconstruct .",
    "silicon surfaces are among the most studied systems of the latest decades , both theoretically and experimentally , and it is well - known that the reconstruction drastically affects their electronic properties . in section  [ sub : wulff ] we discuss the geometry of the surface reconstructed sinws considered and the implication of the wulff s rule in the case nanoscale one - dimensional systems . in section  [ sub : electronic - structure ]",
    "we analyse the electronic structure of the most favoured reconstruction and the localisation of the surface states that have been found to form .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper have been carried out in the framework of density - functional theory  ( dft ) .",
    "we have used both a numerical atomic orbital  @xcite and a plane - wave  @xcite basis set .",
    "we have used a double-@xmath5 polarised basis set  @xcite with pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins  @xcite type and a plane - wave energy cutoff of 20  ry  @xcite with ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the exchange - correlation energy was calculated according to the generalised gradient approximation  @xcite . the wires that we have studied have a diameter of @xmath6  nm and a number of atoms ranging from 57 to 171 , depending on the supercell size and on the adopted shape of the unrelaxed wire section .",
    "the brillouin zone has been sampled according to the monkhorst - pack  @xcite scheme with a converged grid of @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 k - points , depending on the supercell size .",
    "convincing experimental evidence shows that sinws are constructed around a crystalline bulk core  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the section of such a structure will depend on the way in which the involved vicinal surfaces match and on how abrupt is the transition from one to the other .",
    "the case of sinws grown along the @xmath0 direction is of especial interest , because it determines a rather conflictive situation at the edges where two ( 100 ) surfaces meet with a @xmath10 angle [ see figure  [ fig : wulff ] and [ fig : unrelax](c ) ] . in such conditions , it is known from wulff s theorem  @xcite that the formation of a _ facet _ is to be expected , because it would partly release the stress accumulated at the edge .",
    "an example of _ faceting _ of a @xmath0 sinw  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : wulff ] . as can be seen",
    ", the formation of a \\{110 } facet allows a much smoother transition between the two vicinal ( 100)-like surfaces .",
    "however , as discussed previously by zhang and yakobson  @xcite , in the case of very thin one - dimensional structures such as those that we are treating , the predictions of wulff s rule should be carefully revised .",
    "the size of the \\{110 } and of the \\{100 } facets are of the same order of magnitude , thus the surface energy associated to the edges can no longer be neglected , as assumed in wulff s rule . for these reasons ,",
    "the first part of this work has consisted in identifying the favoured faceting arrangement of @xmath0 sinw of nanometric thickness , thus verifying the validity of wulff s theorem in these conditions .",
    "we have considered two different square - section wires [ figure  [ fig : unrelax](a ) and ( c ) ] and two wulff faceting arrangements [ figure  [ fig : unrelax](b ) and ( d ) ] . the square wire of figure  [ fig : unrelax](a ) is made of \\{110 } facets , while the wire in figure  [ fig : unrelax](c ) has only \\{100 } facets .",
    "the wires of figure  [ fig : unrelax](b ) and ( d ) have been obtained from those of figure  [ fig : unrelax](a ) and ( c ) , respectively , smoothening the corners according to wulff s rule prescription .",
    "the way in which the tension at the edges is released and the way in which the different si surface reconstructions ( \\{100 } and \\{110 } facets ) compete among them will determine the minimum energy structure . therefore , given the starting configurations of figure  [ fig : unrelax ] , very different minimum energy structures are expected .",
    "the results of the relaxations are shown in the section - view of figure  [ fig : relax ] . as can be seen ,",
    "all but one of the wires maintain a high degree of in - plane symmetry .",
    "as expected , in the sinw of figure  [ fig : relax](a ) \\{110 } facets are dominant .",
    "the same relaxation pattern is followed by the wire of figure  [ fig : relax](b ) , with the only notable exception of the missing corner atoms , whose removal allow a smoother match between the vicinal ( 110)-like surfaces . in accordance to the prediction of wulff s rule , the sinw of figure  [ fig : relax](b ) turned out to be more stable than that of figure  [ fig : unrelax](a ) ( the difference amounting to @xmath11  33  mev / atom ) . in the relaxation of the sinws of figure  [ fig : relax](c ) and",
    "( d ) \\{100 } facets prevail .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this case the effects of a wulff - like profile are more evident than in the former case . here",
    "an actual edge - faceting develops , mediating the transition between the vicinal ( 100)-like surfaces by \\{110 } facets [ see figure  [ fig : relax](d ) ] . on the other hand , when the edges between the \\{100 } facets are not smoothened , the wire favours a symmetry breaking , ending up with the _ butterfly_-shaped section of figure  [ fig : relax](c ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the _ butterfly _ wire of figure  [ fig : relax](c ) has turned out to be slightly more stable than the wire of figure  [ fig : relax](d ) , thus confirming that at such small diameters the validity of wulff s rule should be carefully checked .    regarding the influence of facet orientation",
    ", we have found that wires dominated by \\{100 } facets [ figure  [ fig : relax](c ) and ( d ) ] are more stable than those where \\{110 } facets prevail [ ( figure  [ fig : relax](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "the cohesive energies are summarised in table  [ tab : cohesive ] . for these reasons ,",
    "the candidate structures for sinws grown along the \\{100 } direction appear to be those in figure  [ fig : relax](c ) and ( d ) , favouring the formation of \\{100 } over \\{110 } facets .",
    ".cohesive energies per atoms of the sinw type illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] .",
    "the sinws where \\{100 } facets prevail are approximately 0.1  ev / atom more stable . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have found that for the sinw of figure  [ fig : relax](d ) two different reconstructions of the \\{100 } facets are possible  @xcite . like in the case of the infinite si(100 ) surface , the reconstruction consists in the formation of a sequence of buckling dimers .",
    "what differs between the two competing geometries that we have obtained is the pattern followed by the si dimers . in one case",
    "they determine a _ trough _ in the middle of the facet , while in the other one every two dimers on one of the two sides is _ flipped _ with respect to the symmetric behaviour of the _ trough _ reconstruction .",
    "the relaxed geometry of the facets of the _ butterfly _ wire is shown in figure  [ fig : facets ] .",
    "the symmetry breaking is reflected in the relaxation and the \\{100 } facets follows two different relaxation patterns .",
    "one of them -  figure  [ fig : facets](a )  - is rather symmetric , with all the dimers of one side flipped ; the facet of figure  [ fig : facets](b ) presents a regular sequence of buckled dimers only in one of the two sides , while in the other one every two dimers is missing .",
    "nanowires -  and sinws in particular  - are expected to play an important role in future molecular electronics applications .",
    "therefore , a thorough understanding of their conductive properties is required . in this section",
    "we discuss our results of the electronic structure of the _ butterfly _ wire [ figure  [ fig : relax](c ) ] , as well as of the two different reconstructions that we have found for the wulff - like sinw [ figure  [ fig : relax](d ) ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) and ( b ) the band structure diagrams corresponding to the two competing geometries for the wulff - like wire are displayed .",
    "it is somehow surprising to discover that they are rather different : while the _ trough _ reconstruction is strongly metallic , with four bands crossing the fermi level , the _ flipped dimer _",
    "geometry is only semi - metallic , with one band approaching the fermi energy with a zero derivative at the zone boundary .",
    "this is quite striking , at first sight , because the differences between the two reconstructions do not seem to be so relevant .",
    "however , when considered in more detail , one notices the pivotal role that the flipped dimer has in breaking the surface bloch state that would otherwise form . on the contrary , the surface state forms in the trough reconstruction where all the si dimers follow the same buckling pattern .    the band structure of the _ butterfly _ wire is shown in figure  [ fig : bands](c ) .",
    "also in this case the reconstruction results in a metallisation of the wire surface , with one band crossing the fermi level and a semi - metallic band tangent to it at the zone boundary .",
    "the formation of these metallic and semi - metallic states is directly induced by the reconstruction of the surface dimers .",
    "therefore , they are expected to be localised at the wire s outer layers .",
    "the dimerisation leads to a dangling bond that hybridises with the other dimers dangling bonds along the nanowire in a surface @xmath12-bond .",
    "the surface nature of the semi - metallic and metallic states of figure  [ fig : bands](c ) is evident in figure  [ fig : wf - butter ] where we have plotted the corresponding wave functions .",
    "as can be seen , the metallic and semi - metallic state are localised , at opposite sides , along one of the @xmath2 diagonal .",
    "a similar surface localisation , though more symmetric , following the pattern of the overall relaxed geometry , is observed for the wulff - like sinw of figure  [ fig : relax](d ) ( not shown here ; see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , conduction in surface - reconstructed sinws will be almost entirely sustained by the outer layers of the wire , with a negligible penetration inside the wire s core .",
    "these results , i.e.  metallic or semi - metallic nature and surface character of the conduction channels , concern all of the @xmath0 wire types that are likely to be obtained . as we have discussed in section  [ sub : wulff ] ( see also table  [ tab : cohesive ] ) , the difference of cohesive energies among the favoured wire geometries [ the wire of figure  [ fig : relax](c ) and the two reconstructions of figure  [ fig : relax](d ) ] are very small and the selective growth of one or another wire seems a difficult task .",
    "we have shown that in absence of a proper passivation , the lateral surface of sinws strongly reconstructs , forming series of buckled dimers with a pattern similar to si ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "depending on the reconstruction , surface states that cross the fermi level can form , leading to metallic or semi - metallic sinws . under such circumstances , doping is no longer needed to have highly conducting nanowires .",
    "the possibility of tailoring sinws that are conducting without the need of doping is particularly relevant in very thin wires where typical doping concentrations require a precision in the fraction of impurities per atom extremely difficult to control .",
    "available experiments have not thoroughly explored the possibility of surface reconstruction or nanowire conductance without doping . however , these results show a promising venue of experimental and theoretical research of pure sinws .    r.r .",
