    "cerium monopnictides , cex , where x @xmath2 ( n , p , as , sb , bi ) form in a rock - salt type crystal structure . in this structure",
    "the ce atom is located on an fcc bravais lattice , with the pnictogen atoms entering octahedral voids of this lattice .",
    "hence , the position of the ce atoms in the ce pnictides is the same as for the @xmath3 and @xmath0 phase of elemental cerium , which has attracted so much attention due to its isostructural volume collapse  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of tuning the @xmath1  wave function overlap between the cerium atoms is an opportunity in the ce pnictides , since the pnictogen atoms all have different size , and hence they expand the fcc lattice to different degrees .",
    "this offers a possibility to in a more detailed way investigate localization  delocalization transitions in ce based materials .",
    "the ce pnictides have indeed been studied intensively in the past , due to that they display several unique and interesting properties , which will shortly be reviewed below .",
    "the lattice constants have been determined , and they suggest that the electronic structure and chemical bonding of cen stand out as being different from the rest of the series  @xcite .",
    "this has previously been suggested to be caused by itinerant @xmath1  states for cen  @xcite , and the theoretical interpretation  @xcite of the measured optical properties are in line with this reasoning  @xcite .",
    "the heavier ce pnictides have lattice constants , and other physical properties , which suggest a localized and non - bonding @xmath1  shell .",
    "the observed properties of the heavier ce pnictides are in many ways unique , for instance , the magnetism and the crystal field splitting of the @xmath1  shell exhibit puzzling behaviour , as analyzed in detail in refs .  .",
    "another unique feature of the ce pnictides is found in the excited state properties , as revealed by the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) .",
    "several investigations have been reported @xcite , and they reveal an xps spectrum which is rather complex as concerns the @xmath1  signal . a feature between 2.9 - 3.2  ev binding energy",
    "is observed together with a feature closer to the fermi level , at around 0.6 ev binding energy .",
    "the exact positions of these two distinct features vary from pnictide to pnictide , see e.g. ref .  .",
    "the presence of these two peaks is at first glance surprising , having in mind that a localized @xmath4  configuration of the heavier ce pnictides , is expected to result in one spectral feature corresponding to a @xmath5 transition .",
    "however , it has been pointed out  @xcite that two screening channels of the final state core hole are possible for this excitation , a well screened and a poor screened channel , which results in two distinct spectral features .",
    "the presence of two peaks in the @xmath1 spectrum is a property not only of ce pnictides , but also other ce compounds ( see , for example , refs .  ) .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "electronic structure calculations have been published for cen , analyzing the energy band structure and the optical properties  @xcite .",
    "results of this work are based on the lda / gga and , essentially , correlation effects are taken into account only weakly .",
    "a recent calculation  @xcite for cen focused on the electronic structure and the lattice dynamics . in this work",
    "the @xmath1 states were considered as delocalized , and the calculations used both the lda / gga level of approximation as well as the so called gw  @xcite approximation .",
    "for the heavier ce pnictides a theory of the crystal field splitting was proposed  @xcite , which successfully reproduced the observations of ref .  .",
    "the work of ref .   was a combination of model considerations and first principles theory , in which the localization of the @xmath1 wave function was enforced in the calculation , and then the hybridization to other valence states was estimated from this electronic configuration .",
    "previous dmft investigations of ce pnictides are presented in refs .  , wherein the anderson impurity problem was solved in a finite - u extension of the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , including some lowest - order crossing diagrams .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit the problem of the electronic structure of the ce pnictides , and the localization - delocalization phenomena of the @xmath1 shell , in light of recent developments of treating electron correlations directly in electronic structure calculations .",
    "in particular , we investigate how well dynamical mean field theory reproduces the lattice parameters and spectral properties of these materials , and we have used the implementation reported in refs .   for these purposes , with the hi and sptf solvers .",

    "the lda / gga+dmft calculations were done by means of the implementation presented in refs .",
    ", with the total energies evaluated following ref .  .",
    "to solve the anderson impurity model arising in the dmft part , the sptf solver  @xcite was used for cen , whereas the hubbard  i solver  @xcite was used for cep , ceas , cesb , and cebi .",
    "the lda / gga+dmft scheme was applied to the @xmath1 state of cerium using two types of the correlated orbitals  @xcite : orthogonalized lmto subspace  ( ort ) and muffin - tin only correlated subspace  ( mt ) .",
    "all these ort and mt orbitals are localized , and form orthonormal sets .",
    "the ort set consists of functions obtained from the fp - lmto method with the lda / gga hamiltonian for the correlated states .",
    "the mt correlated subspace is defined only into the muffin - tin region , and outside of the muffin - tin spheres the mt orbitals are taken equal to zero by definition .",
    "properties of these subspaces are analyzed in the works published in refs .  .",
    "in the present calculations the mt set was used for cen , and the ort set for all other ce pnictides .",
    "the lda / gga calculations included spin - orbit coupling in the scalar - relativistic approximation , and only within the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "the radii of the muffin - tin spheres for the different compounds were kept constant while changing the lattice parameters , and their values are reported in table  [ tblrmt ] . for the brillouin zone integration",
    "the tetrahedron method was used with a @xmath6 @xmath7-mesh .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath8 @xmath7-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone with the total number of @xmath7-points in the brillouin zone equal to @xmath9 . for the charge density and potential angular decomposition inside the muffin - tin spheres the value of maximum angular momentum",
    "was taken equal to @xmath10 .",
    "three kinetic energy tails were used , corresponding to @xmath11 ry .",
    "finally all calculations were non - spin polarized , except cen which was converged to a ferromagnetic solution .",
    "magnetic properties were in fact considered at the dmft level , and the sptf solver works better when starting from a magnetic solution  @xcite .",
    "calculations without dmft in the pure pw91/pbe96/am05 approximations were done in two ways : the cerium @xmath1 electrons were treated either as core or as itinerant states . in the latter case two kinetic energy tails",
    "were considered for the basis .    for the lda",
    "/ gga+dmft calculations it is necessary to choose an adequate value for the hubbard and ( hund ) exchange parameters u and j. for all ce pnictides except cen we have used u=7 ev and j=0.95 ev , which is compatible with previous calculations  @xcite considering that our method is also based on a fully rotationally invariant u - matrix  @xcite .",
    "conversely the @xmath1 states in cen have basically an itinerant character , as discussed more in detail in the results section .",
    "this implies that the screening of the coulomb interaction is much more effective and the value of u reduced in comparison to the other ce pnictides .",
    "following these guidelines and having in mind that the sptf solver tends to overestimate correlation effects  @xcite we have used u=2 ev , which is consistent with its applicability range .",
    "higher values of u have also been studied but these results have not been reported here as they gave the same physical picture as u=2 ev . the value of the hund s exchange is less dependent on the nature of the screening in a material , and therefore we have used j=0.95 ev for cen as well .    to calculate the energy versus volume curves in the hubbard  i approximation , it is important to correctly treat the double counting term @xmath12 included in the local problem  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 term is used to remove the wrong contributions of local coulomb interaction already contained in the dft hamiltonian projected on the correlated orbitals ( @xmath1 states ) and used in the dmft part .",
    "the double counting term was first calculated from the hi solver at experimental lattice constants , and then kept fixed for all the other values . in order to fix the main occupied peak at the correct position the photoemission data available from experiments  @xcite were used .",
    "the experimental binding energies and double counting term values are presented in table  [ dctbl ] for the pw91/pbe96/am05 + hi approximations .",

    "[ fig2 ] point to that the @xmath1 states do not contribute to the chemical bonding in the heavier ce pnictides .",
    "in contrast , the cen compound is a system which seems best described having delocalized @xmath1 states as it follows from the comparison of our calculated values and the experimental data .",
    "the dmft calculation with the sptf solver and the pure am05 dft calculation with itinerant @xmath1 states reproduce the observed lattice constant with good accuracy . conversely if one tries to assume a localized @xmath1 electron in the form of a core state the results become more in line with the other ce pnictides , but the agreement with experiments worsen .",
    "these facts point to that the @xmath1 states have an important role in the chemical bonding , which results in a significantly smaller lattice constant of cen in comparison to the heavier ce pnictides ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the delocalized nature of the @xmath1 electron makes it not suitable for the hubbard i approximation or any other approach in the strong coupling limit , unless one wants to apply semi - empirical workarounds .",
    "for example , in a previous lda+dmft study  @xcite based on the nca solver , the @xmath1 hybridization function in cen had to be rescaled of a factor 2 to avoid an unphysical occupation number of the @xmath1 shell .    to give further evidence to this fact we observe that the calculated spectral properties of cen are in rather good agreement with experimental data , when considering the @xmath1 states as essentially itinerant with some degree of correlation resulting from the sptf solver .",

    "as one can see , the hubbard  i approximation describes the deeply localized @xmath1 feature in a proper way , although due to life time broadening and finite spectrometer resolution the experimental feature is much wider compared to theory .",
    "note that the hubbard  i approximation is not able to capture the well screened feature at the fermi level , and indeed the experimental feature can not be reproduced with the present calculations .",
    "the experimental results for the non resonant frequency of @xmath1 ce states are compared with the total and partial theoretical spectral functions in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for this photon energy",
    "the main contribution to the observed peak is from cerium @xmath18 states and phosphorus @xmath19 states  @xcite .",
    "the experimental peak - width and position are reproduced by the ce @xmath18 and p @xmath19 partial spectral functions , as fig .",

    "a similar picture occurs for the other heavy pnictides , for which we in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] ,  [ fig8 ] compare calculated spectral features with experimental data taken on and off resonance .",
    "as discussed , the @xmath1 feature close to the fermi energy ( the well screened peak ) is not reproduced in our hubbard  i calculation . however",
    ", going from cep to cebi the experimental @xmath1 peak at the fermi level decreases in intensity and becomes almost negligible in the cebi case .",
    "for this pnictide the hubbard  i approximation hence gives the best description of the spectral features .    in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] , and  [ fig8 ] we also show the unoccupied states .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath1 dominated spectral features are due to an @xmath22 transition , in which multiplet effects are clearly visible . since we have not found experimental bis data for the heavy ce pnictides our theory must be viewed as a prediction .",

    "@xmath0-ce is a localized @xmath1 system , and therefore a hubbard  i calculation for @xmath0-ce should reproduce the lattice constant with equal accuracy as it does for the ce pnictides .",

    "@xcite , showing again that the am05+hi approach results in the best agreement with experiment .",
    "for @xmath0-ce we have also calculated the bulk modulus to investigate if the lack of the well - screened @xmath1  feature in the spectrum leads to a deficiency in more sensitive ground state properties than the lattice constant .",
    "we obtain a bulk modulus of @xmath31  gpa , @xmath32  gpa , and @xmath33  gpa , respectively for pw91+hi , pbe96+hi , and am05+hi .",
    "these values are in line with the gga+u result of @xmath34  gpa  @xcite , and overestimate the experimental bulk modulus , which is equal to @xmath35  gpa@xcite . a better theory based on a more sophisticated approach",
    "would probably be able to correct this disagreement with the experiments .",
    "we conclude that the lda / gga+dmft approach used in the present work with the sptf and hubbard  i solvers gives very good values of lattice constants and acceptable spectral properties of ce pnictides .",
    "the hubbard  i solver is not able to capture the experimental kondo - like feature at the fermi level observed for cep , ceas and cesb , while for cebi this peak is almost absent , and only a small shoulder is visible .",
    "this deficiency is inner to the method used , and may potentially be remedied with more sophisticated techniques such as quantum monte - carlo .",
    "however , in this case , technical problems of different nature may be introduced and related to the statistical noise of the green s function . for reasonable computational resources",
    "the occupation numbers and the total energies would be less stable , and the spectral function would suffer of the uncertainty related to the maximum entropy method for analytical continuation . finally it would also be problematic to include the spin - orbit coupling without arbitrarily discarding parts of the hybridization function .",
    "it is interesting , nevertheless , that despite the inability of the hubbard  i approximation ( or the sptf solver ) to capture the well - screened kondo - like peak observed for some ce pnictides the lattice constants are reproduced with a very good accuracy .",
    "this implies that the mechanism behind this feature does not contribute much to the chemical bonding .",
    "more sensitive properties as , e.g. , the bulk modulus would probably show a signature of this discrepancy between theory and experiment , as verified in this paper for @xmath0-ce",
    ". it would be of a great interest to approach this problem with more refined methods , and this will be the aim of our future research .",
    "finally we also note that the lattice constants for the heavier ce pnictides , in which the @xmath1 states are essentially localized and non - bonding , can be well reproduced from a theory where these states are treated as core - states where they are not allowed to hop from lattice site to lattice site , and where hybridization to all other states is absent .",
    "hence , a good alternative to treat the @xmath1 states of localized @xmath1 electron systems is to simply consider them as core like , which is an approximation that offers great computational speed with decent accuracy .",

    "<S> we present calculated spectral properties and lattice parameters for cerium pnictides ( cen , cep , ceas , cesb , cebi ) and @xmath0-ce , within the lda / gga+dmft ( local density approximation / generalized gradient approximation + dynamical mean field theory ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> the effective impurity model arising in the dmft is solved by using the spin - polarized t - matrix fluctuation - exchange ( sptf ) solver for cen compound , and the hubbard  i ( hi ) solver for cep , ceas , cesb , and cebi . </S>",
    "<S> for all the addressed compounds the calculated spectral properties are in reasonable agreement with measured photoelectron spectra at high binding energies . at low binding energies </S>",
    "<S> the hi approximation does not manage to capture the kondo - like peak observed for several of the ce - pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the calculated lattice constants are in a good agreement with available experimental data , showing that the such a peak does not play a major role on the bonding properties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the hi calculations are compared to a simpler treatment of the ce @xmath1 electron as core - like in lda / gga for cep , ceas , cesb , and cebi , and the two approaches are found to give similar results . </S>"
