    "cyg x-1 is believed to be powered by accretion through an accretion disc .",
    "its x - ray spectrum indicates the existence of a hot x - ray emitting and a cold reflecting gas .",
    "the soft blackbody component is thought to be thermal emission from an optically thick and cool accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray part @xmath3 kev with a break at @xmath4 kev has been attributed to thermal disc emission comptonized by a corona with a temperature of @xmath5 kev @xcite . a broad hump peaking at @xmath6 kev @xcite , an iron k@xmath7 emission line at @xmath8 kev @xcite , and a strong iron k - edge @xcite",
    "have been interpreted as signatures of compton reflection of hard x - rays off cold accreting material .",
    "there have also been reports of a hard component extending into the mev region .",
    "most famous was the so - called ` mev bump ' observed at a @xmath9 level during the heao-3 mission @xcite . for a discussion of the pre - cgro data",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the average x - ray flux of cyg x-1 shows a two - modal behavior .",
    "most of its time it spends in a so - called ` low ' state where the soft x - ray luminosity is low .",
    "there are occasional periods of ` high ' state emission .",
    "remarkable is the anticorrelation between the soft and hard x - ray components @xcite , which is clearly seen during transitions between the two states .",
    "since its launch in 1991 cgro has observed cyg x-1 several times .",
    "the comptel spectrum shows significant emission out to several mev , which however , remained always more than an order of magnitude below the mev bump reported by heao-3 .",
    "the spectrum accumulated between 91 and 95 by the comptel @xcite , batse @xcite , and osse @xcite instruments is shown in fig .",
    "although the osse and batse normalizations are different , the spectral shape is very similar .",
    "table 1 shows the average luminosity of cyg x-1 ( at 2.5 kpc ) as derived from the batse - comptel spectrum .",

    "the existence of a compact pair - dominated core around a bh in cyg x-1 is probably ruled out by the cgro observations .",
    "a signature of such a core would be a bump @xcite similar to the one reported by heao-3 .",
    "however no evidence for such a bump was found in the cgro data @xcite .",
    "additionally , the luminosity of cyg x-1 above 0.5 mev , though small , exceeds substantially the eddington luminosity for pairs , which is @xmath10 times lower than for a hydrogen plasma .",
    "also the hard mev tail can not be explained by comptonization in a corona ( @xmath11 kev ) and thus another mechanism is required .",
    "we consider the proton - dominated optically thin solution @xcite , @xmath12 , where the @xmath0-ray emission is attributed to a spatially extended cloud surrounding the whole accretion disc ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the outer corona , which emits via bremsstrahlung , comptonization , and positron annihilation , and analyze possible consequences of that .",
    "we adopt a standard model for x - rays , where the hard x - rays are produced by comptonization of the soft x - ray emission in an inner corona , and the soft x - rays are a composition of the local blackbody emission from the disc and the reflection component .",
    "the optical depth of the outer corona has to be so small that the disc and inner corona emission is only slightly reprocessed in it .",
    "the spectral modelling has been carried out with the @xmath13- and @xmath14-bremsstrahlung emissivities given by numerical fits of @xcite . for the @xmath15-bremssrahlung and annihilation emissivities",
    "we use the integration formulas of @xcite . to calculate the effect of compton scattering",
    "we follow the model of @xcite , which generally agrees well with monte carlo simulations except at high temperatures , @xmath16 , and small optical depth .",
    "but it still provides a correct spectral index .",
    "we found that a power - law with a cutoff , @xmath17^{\\alpha+1 } ( 1-e^{-kt / e})$ ] , where @xmath7 is determined by the equation of @xcite , gives a reasonable agreement with monte carlo simulations up to @xmath18 mev .",
    "the chosen normalization provides a correct value of the amplification factor @xcite .",
    "the emission of the accretion disc which is reprocessed by the inner corona was taken monoenergetic , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 kev is the effective temperature of the soft excess @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the narrow annihilation line from the disc plane can be estimated by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 number density in the outer corona , @xmath24 the speed of light , @xmath25 the disc radius , @xmath26 the distance , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the inclination angle of the disc plane .",
    "the fitting parameters are : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the temperature and optical depth of the inner ( _ i _ ) and outer ( _ o _ ) coronae ( spheres ) , @xmath33 , the luminosity of the _ disc _ effectively comptonized by the _",
    "i_-corona , @xmath34 , the _ total _ effective luminosity of the central source in soft x - rays illuminating the _ o_-corona , @xmath35 , the _ o_-corona radius , and , @xmath36 , the positron - to - proton ratio in it .",
    "the bremsstrahlung and annihilation photon fluxes from the outer corona are proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , if the annihilation contributes significantly , there is a continuum of solutions given by an equation @xmath38 , at @xmath39 fixed , where @xmath40 varies slowly for @xmath41 . for a negligible positron fraction",
    "the continuum of solutions is defined by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is fixed from fitting .",

    ".the best fit model parameters . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     the observed spectra of cyg x-1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] together with our model calculations .",
    "the parameters obtained from spectral fitting are listed in table [ tab2 ] . for comparison two parameter sets with the same @xmath45",
    "are shown , however the first one ( ) seems to be more physical .",
    "the average batse - comptel spectrum corresponds probably to the normal state of cyg x-1 .",
    "only two components contribute : the comptonized emission from the inner and outer coronae .",
    "the parameters obtained for the heao-3 @xmath2 state are similar , though the upper limits at @xmath46 mev allow some positron fraction ( ) . for the heao-3 @xmath1 ` bump ' spectrum the outer corona size is several times larger , while the inner corona is small or even absent at all ( set ) .",
    "the non - negligible positron fraction ( for @xmath47 dependence see above ) is too high to be produced in the optically thin outer corona @xcite .",
    "therefore , we suggest a positron production mechanism , which could sometimes operate in the inner disc . the radiation pressure would necessarily cause a pair wind , which serves as energy input into the _ o_-corona thereby increasing its radius .",
    "the small luminosity of the disc which is comptonized by the inner corona , @xmath48 erg / s , probably implies a geometry where only the inner part of the disc is effectively covered by the corona . otherwise ,",
    "if the corona forms a disc - like structure where the intensity depends on the inclination angle , then it should cover almost all of the x - ray emitting area of the disc .",
    "the soft ( @xmath49 kev ) x - ray luminosity of cyg x-1 is @xmath50 erg / s on average @xcite , while during the heao-3 @xmath1 , @xmath2 states it was even lower @xcite .",
    "taking into account that for hard x - ray photons the comptonization efficiency in the hot plasma drops substantially @xcite while the number of photons decreases as well , the obtained values , @xmath51 erg / s , match the data .",
    "no pairs are required to reproduce the spectrum of cyg x-1 in its normal state .",
    "if one takes @xmath52 photons @xmath53 s@xmath54 @xcite for the annihilation line flux in the @xmath1 state , it allows the accretion disc radius to be estimated to @xmath55 cm ( set ) .",
    "the allowed upper limit derived from optical measurements is @xmath56 cm @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the obtained parameters are consistent with a picture where the spectral changes are governed by the mass accretion rate @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 state probably corresponds to a smaller @xmath58 compared to the normal state . in this context",
    ", the @xmath0-ray luminosity should anticorrelate with the hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "the extended hot outer corona can be treated as the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) co - existing with a cool optically thick disc , though in contrast to a standard adaf @xcite , the electrons here are hot and the protons are cold .",
    "this is possible since cooling via bremsstrahlung and coulomb @xmath15-collisions at low density is unimportant while small optical depth prevents from effective compton cooling .",
    "the adequate heating could be provided by the electron thermal conduction from a region with nearly virial ion temperature .",
    "useful discussions with n.shakura , r.narayan , l.titarchuk , and m.gilfanov are greatly acknowledged .",
    "we are particularly grateful to m.mcconnell for providing us with the combined spectra of cyg x-1 prior to publication , and e.churazov for monte carlo simulations of comptonization in @xmath16 , @xmath59 plasma .",
