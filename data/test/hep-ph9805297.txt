    "the heavy mass expansion for inclusive decays of heavy hadrons has become a generally accepted tool .",
    "although there are hints that there could be problems in the calculation of lifetimes ( the @xmath1lifetime ) within this framework , the @xmath2 expansion seems to be an appropriate method to access semileptonic processes@xcite .",
    "however , if one is aiming at a complete description of the spectra ( i.e. energy of the charged lepton @xmath3 or the hadronic invariant mass @xmath4 ) in general problems are encountered in the endpoint region , where @xmath5 becomes small .",
    "typically this invariant mass is of the order @xmath6 , the mass of the decaying hadron .",
    "this is true in almost all phase space ; however , getting closer to the endpoint it has become popular to distinguish two regions .",
    "the first region is the one with very small @xmath7 and also very small hadronic energy @xmath8 ( here @xmath9 is the velocity of the decaying hadron ) ; here the proper description is a summation over the very few exclusive channels contributing in this region .",
    "however , in the second region where the hadronic energy is still large @xmath10 but the invariant mass @xmath5 becomes small , namely @xmath11 , there is still the possibility to obtain a proper qcd description of the decay . in this case",
    "it has been shown @xcite that one may resum the leading twist terms into a universal light - cone distribution function ( or shape function ) for the heavy quark . this function is entirely non - perturbative and may be written formally as a forward matrix element of a non - local operator .",
    "this nonlocal operator corresponds to the fourier transform of the wilson line @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are computable perturbative corrections which exhibit logarithmic singularities close to the endpoint region . to first order in @xmath12 the leading contribution to the spectrum close to the endpoint",
    "is of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is now the partonic analogue of the hadronic invariant mass of the final state . upon integration",
    "this yields the usual sudakov logarithms .",
    "several methods have been proposed to combine both perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "at least for the doubly logarithmic terms this should be possible since they are process independent and hence could be assigned to the universal shape function .",
    "in addition , close to the endpoint , a resummation of the double logarithms becomes necessary , since these terms become large .",
    "such a resummation may be achieved by setting up an evolution equation for the shape function as it has been proposed in @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we use such an evolution equation and solve it analytically by putting in the one loop result for the anomalous dimensions . in the next section",
    "we express the hadronic invariant mass spectra in terms of the shape function , thereby defining a limit in which the leading twist dominates . in section 3",
    "we consider the renormalization of the shape function and set up an evolution equation and derive the anomalous dimension in section 4 .",
    "finally we solve the evolution equation analytically and discuss the implications for the evolution of the moments of the shape function .",
    "in inclusive decays such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 the effective hamiltonian takes the general form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a hadronic current and @xmath19 is either leptonic or photonic .",
    "we shall in the following consider the invariant mass spectrum of the final state hadrons .",
    "we denote with @xmath5 the square of this invariant mass .",
    "the spectrum may be written as @xmath20 where phase space integration over the leptonic and hadronic total momentum @xmath21 , @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the leptonic ( or photonic ) and hadronic tensors are defined as @xmath24 the non - hadronic part can be calculated perturbatively and is treated in the following as a known function of @xmath21 .",
    "the object of our interest is the hadronic part , @xmath25 which in general can not be determined perturbatively .",
    "proceeding along standard lines we have @xmath26 the hadronic current is usually a bilinear function of two quark operators one of which is a heavy @xmath27 quark .",
    "using the fact that the heavy mass @xmath28 sets a large scale compared to @xmath29 we may set up an operator product expansion in the usual way .",
    "we write @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents a massless quark and the large part of the @xmath27quark momentum has been explicitely removed from the field by a phase redefinition .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath32    in the following we are interested in the endpoint region , which is defined by a specific kinematical limit denoted large  energy limit .",
    "we shall define this limit first in terms of the partonic total momentum of the final state @xmath33",
    "corresponding to the partonic invariant mass @xmath14 and the partonic energy @xmath34 . in the endpoint region the total energy @xmath34 of the final state scales with the heavy quark mass @xmath28 while the invariant mass @xmath14 is of @xmath35 such that the light  cone component @xmath36 of the total final state momentum remains finite of @xmath37 : @xmath38 we shall relate the partonic variables to the hadronic ones at the end of the section .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that in the limit ( [ limit ] ) the leading contribution may be obtained by contracting the light quark @xmath39 b_v ( x ) | b(p ) \\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression may be taylor - expanded around @xmath40 and the expansion resummed to yield formally @xmath41 in the following , @xmath42functions as in the preceding expression are defined by their fourier transform , which involves a path - ordered exponential as in  ( [ wilson ] ) .    performing the @xmath43integration we get @xmath44    in the endpoint region ( [ limit ] )",
    "@xmath45 is almost light  like and can be decomposed as @xmath46 thus in ( [ eq : qcontr ] ) we can approximate ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 neglecting terms of @xmath49 : @xmath50 for the perturbative calculation in the next section it is useful to rewrite @xmath51 in terms of the imaginary part @xmath52 where @xmath53    using heavy  quark symmetry to disentangle the dirac structure of this expression we finally arrive at @xmath54 where @xmath55 .    here",
    "we have introduced the shape function or light  cone distribution function for the heavy quark @xmath56 the light ",
    "cone structure function @xmath57 measures the probability of finding a heavy quark with light  cone component @xmath58 inside the b  meson and is a universal function .    up to now",
    "we have worked in terms of partonic variables , while experimentally only hadronic variables are of interest . introducing the hadronic light ",
    "cone variable in terms of the hadronic invariant mass squared @xmath5 and the hadronic energy @xmath59 we have @xmath60 we find that the support of @xmath57 is the interval @xmath61 such that @xmath62 . in reality , the spectrum is peaked near @xmath63 . the shape function may directly be measured in a inclusive semileptonic or radiative decay by measuring the spectrum of the hadronic light  cone variable @xmath64 .",
    "in the last section we have shown , that in the large  energy limit the integrated hadronic tensor @xmath65 can be approximated by the quantity @xmath51 defined in the large energy limit of qcd . up to now only non  perturbative corrections resummed in the structure function are included .    to really establish the approximation we have to check that this also works perturbatively , since it is well known that in the kinematical region of small invariant mass @xmath66 the perturbative spectrum is plagued by large logarithmic corrections .",
    "therefore we should require that order by order in perturbation theory the leading ir singularities of @xmath65 arising in the large  energy limit should be reproduced by @xmath51 .",
    "the leading logarithms are universal and hence we may assign them to be perturbative corrections to the structure function .    in order to identify the relevant ir singularities which have to be reproduced by perturbative corrections to the structure function we shall first consider the hadronic invariant mass spectrum calculated in full qcd in the large  energy limit .",
    "the relevant terms of the one loop contribution can be generically written as @xmath67\\ ] ] where the real functions @xmath68 are regular in the limit @xmath69 with @xmath36 fixed . from this",
    "we easily identify the ir singularity as the @xmath70term since @xmath36 is held fixed in the large  energy limit .",
    "if the large  energy limit makes sense in perturbation theory , we have to require that exactly this term is reproduced by the @xmath71corrections to the light  cone distribution function .",
    "the origin of this logarithmic divergence in the spectrum can be traced back to double logarithms of the correlator @xmath72 . thus to one - loop order the double logarithmic terms in @xmath72 and @xmath73 have to match in the large  energy limit .",
    "it therefore suffices to look for the most singular feynman integrals contributing to the correlators at @xmath71 .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the shape function consist of vertex diagrams , self - energy contributions and a box - type diagram . however , in full qcd the uv divergencies of the self - energy diagrams cancel with the uv divergency of the vertex diagram because of current conservation . for the shape function divergent pieces",
    "appear in the self energy of the heavy quark which will be taken into account below .",
    "the self - energy insertion into the light - cone propagator does not contribute .",
    "thus , we can restrict ourselves to the vertex diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",

    ", we can directly compute the corrections to the shape function either by reading off the propagator from ( [ eq : corrleeft ] ) or by the usual way of calculating corrections to wilson lines  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expression is @xmath77 in which the leading logarithms have to match the full qcd result ( [ eq : threeqcd ] ) .    evaluating the corresponding integrals @xmath78 and @xmath79 to double logarithmic accuracy and supressing constant terms we get @xmath80 \\nonumber\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 note that ( [ eq : dbllogqcd ] ) is valid up to single logarithmic corrections .    due to the presence of both uv and collinear divergencies , a @xmath82 pole appears .",
    "however , both singularities are of uv nature in the sense that the integral converges for @xmath83 and can therefore be removed by renormalization , as will be explained below",
    ".    in the difference of both integrals @xmath84 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the double logarithms do not cancel .",
    "the operator to be renormalized [ i.e. , the operator defining the light - cone distribution function  ( [ eq : strufu ] ) ] is of nonlocal nature .",
    "hence , we can introduce an integration over @xmath85 , which plays the role of a summation over a continuous operator basis labeled by @xmath85 , to absorb the local as well as the nonlocal uv divergencies in  ( [ eq : diffint ] ) into a renormalized distribution function .",
    "furthermore , the difference of integrals  ( [ eq : diffint ] ) has a finite part . in order to reproduce the amplitudes ( defined in a definite scheme , e.g. @xmath86 ) of full qcd in the effective theory , these parts , the _ matching corrections _",
    ", have to be included in the renormalization constants . in ordinary effective theories such as hqet",
    ", such finite matching corrections will not affect the scaling behavior to one - loop order , so they have to be taken into account explicitly only from two - loop order on .",
    "by contrast , in the present case the finite matching corrections @xmath87 explicitly depend on the renormalization scale  @xmath88 and therefore modify the scaling behavior already at one - loop order .    in order to find the renormalization kernel ,",
    "we take the imaginary part of the difference of vertex corrections to the correlators @xmath89 and @xmath90 resulting from ( [ eq : diffint ] ) , keeping only uv  poles and double logarithms : @xmath91   f^{(bare)}(k_+')\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term in square brackets accounts for wave function renormalization of the heavy  quark fields .",

    "we can define a renormalized shape function @xmath94 where the one loop renormalization kernel reads @xmath95 in what follows it will be convenient to switch to the @xmath96scheme setting @xmath97 and keeping terms proportional to @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the renormalization ",

    "we insert ( [ eq : soleveq ] ) into ( [ eq : renhadten ] ) , choose for @xmath88 a high energy scale @xmath124 and let @xmath125 @xmath126 the coefficient function @xmath127 is analogous to the set of wilson coefficients @xmath128 in local effective field theories .    note that , by definition , the convolution of the renormalized structure function with the coefficient function is independent of the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath88 . at the low energy scale @xmath129 the structure function",
    "is only weakly affected by perturbative corrections and can be safely considered as a pure non  perturbative object which may be described by a model  @xcite : @xmath130    putting everything together , the renormalization group improved hadronic tensor becomes : @xmath131",
    "it is well known that the moments of the light ",
    "cone structure function may be related to matrix elements of local operators .",
    "the moments satisfy the relation @xmath132 in particular we have @xmath133 and @xmath134 due to the normalization and the equations of motion .",
    "however , since the light  cone distribution funtion evolves with a change of scale , also the moments depend on the scale .",
    "the moments at the scale @xmath88 are given by @xmath135 since the kernel @xmath136 depends only on the difference of @xmath36 and @xmath137 one may reexpress these moments in terms of the moments at scale @xmath138 by a simple change of variables .",
    "one obtains @xmath139 which means that under renormalization the @xmath140 moment will depend on all the moments @xmath141 with @xmath142 at the lower scale .",
    "however , due to the power type behaviour in the variable @xmath143 of the evolution kernel @xmath144 the integral in ( [ momrel ] ) does not converge , since the region of integration is @xmath145 and hence it has to be regularized .",
    "if we regularize the integral by restricting the integration region to @xmath146 with some cut off @xmath147 , the dependence on @xmath147 can be already guessed from dimensional analysis .",
    "more precisely , the moments @xmath148 exhibit power divergencies where the dependence on @xmath147 is given by @xmath149 where from ( [ eq : rgevsimp ] ) we get @xmath150 to interpret this result it is instructive to consider the first few moments . the normalization receives a multiplicative renormalization @xmath151 while the first moment receives contributions from both @xmath152 and @xmath153 : @xmath154 however , the first moment is @xmath155 which according to the equations of motion should vanish .",
    "this is true , if the pole mass of the heavy quark is taken as the expansion parameter , such that no residual mass term appears .",
    "the choice of a different mass definition @xmath156 will modify the equation of motion into @xmath157 and hence the running of the first moment implies a change in the pole mass definition due to the power divergence @xmath158 in principle this relation can be used to fix the value of the cut - off in terms of the pole mass ; once this is done , all higher moments can be computed in terms of the pole mass at the lower scale @xmath138 .",
    "although the shape function is an object entirely defined in hqet and hence should be independent of the mass @xmath28 , in this indirect way a mass dependence comes into the game , at least if we insist to interpret the moments in terms of the matrix elements ( [ eq : mom ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a method to combine perturbative and non - perturbative contributions to hadronic invariant mass spectra in the endpoint region where the invariant mass @xmath5 becomes small of the order @xmath159 . at tree level",
    "the non  perturbative corrections of leading twist are resummed into a universal light",
    " cone distribution function .",
    "however , taking radiative corrections into account , this function has to be renormalized . in order to match the leading ir ",
    "singularity of the qcd spectrum , we have chosen a renormalization scheme which except standard uv  renormalization provides corrections of the ir  behaviour of the structure function adding proper finite terms to the renormalization kernel . as a consequence of renormalization the renormalization scale dependence of the structure function is described by an evolution equation .",
    "we have computed the evolution kernel to one loop order , which deviates from the usual @xmath160kernel , since we have included a finite renormalization in order to reproduce the infrared behaviour of full qcd .",
    "the analytical solution of the evolution equation yields a resummation of logarithmic corrections and relates structure functions at different renormalization scales .",
    "the last property has then be used to include radiative corrections in the invariant mass spectrum in a manner common from usual renormalization group techniques .    as the structure function itself",
    "is scale dependent so are its moments .",
    "however , including radiative corrections the moments exhibit an uv  divergence which has been regularized by an hard cut off thereby mixing moments of different order .",
    "we fixed the cut off by relating the first moment to the definition of the pole mass .",
    "once the value of the cut off is known , the scale dependence of all other moments is computable .",
