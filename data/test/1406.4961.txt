    "neutron stars are fascinating objects to probe exotic states of dense matter that can not be otherwise studied in a terrestrial laboratory . the central density of its core surpasses the nuclear density by a few times .",
    "exact nature of its internal structure is yet to be understood .",
    "various theoretical models have been proposed to explain its structure and characteristics . among them",
    "walecka model , a lorentz covariant theory of dense matter involving baryons and mesons , has been widely applied to study the neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "this traditional meson exchange picture is known as the relativistic field theoretical model .",
    "the model including non - linear scalar meson terms yields the saturation properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei quite well .",
    "however , regime above saturation density is not well understood .",
    "extrapolating the nuclear matter properties to high density leads to uncertainties . in most of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations , non - linear self interaction terms for scalar and vector fields",
    "are introduced to account for the high density behaviour @xcite . but this may not be a reliable approach due to instabilities and higher order field dependence that may appear at high densities . another more suitable approach is to incorporate the density - dependence through the meson - baryon couplings @xcite . in the density",
    "dependent model the appearance of a rearrangement term in baryon chemical potential significantly changes the pressure , consequently the equation of state ( eos ) at higher densities .    we must also consider the role of nuclear symmetry energy , the energy associated with the isospin asymmetry , on the behaviour of the eos at high densities .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy alters the stiffness of the eos .",
    "it is of great importance , along with its density dependence , in studying many crucial problems in astrophysics , such as neutronization in core collapse supernova explosion , neutrino emission from protoneutron star ( pns ) , neutron star radii , crust thickness , cooling among various others @xcite .",
    "the symmetry energy and its density dependence near the saturation density @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath4 and slope parameter @xmath5 respectively .",
    "these parameters can be constrained by the findings of precise nuclear physics experiments ( heavy ion collision analysis , dipole polarizability analysis etc . ) as well as astrophysical observations .",
    "the bounds on the parameters are found to be 29 mev @xmath6 32.7 mev and 40.5 mev @xmath7 61.9 mev respectively @xcite .",
    "now if we look into the most popular and widely used parametrizations to model neutron star structure , such as gm1 , tm1 , nl3 etc . , we find that the values of both symmetry energy and its slope parameters in all these cases ( for gm1 , @xmath8 mev and @xmath9 mev ; tm1 , @xmath10 mev and @xmath11 mev ; nl3 , @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev @xcite ) do not quite fall into the experimental range .",
    "whereas the density dependent ( dd2 ) rmf model , we are going to employ in this paper with @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 mev , are fully consistent with the above experimental and observational constraints @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is the only relativistic eos model with linear couplings .",
    "also the dd2 eos model agrees well with the predictions by chiral eft @xcite .",
    "however it should be noted that the density dependent parametrization ( dd ) was in use @xcite even before this symmetry energy experimental data was available .",
    "the current dd2 model differs from the previous dd model only by the use of experimental nuclear masses @xcite .",
    "the discovery of binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 in 1974 by hulse and taylor lead to first precise measurement of neutron star mass ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "the millisecond pulsar psr 1903 + 0327 of @xmath17 @xcite , measured in 2008 , psr j1614 - 2230 of @xmath0 @xcite in 2010 and psr j0348 + 0432 of @xmath1 @xcite subsequently in 2011 have raised the bar .",
    "the knowledge of the precisely measured mass of neutron stars has important consequences for constraining the equation of state of dense matter .",
    "it can throw light on otherwise poorly known composition of the compact star core .",
    "it is still an open issue if novel phases of matter such as hyperons , bose - einstein condensates of pions and kaons and also quarks may exist in neutron star interior or not .",
    "the presence of hyperons and antikaon condensates makes the eos softer resulting in a smaller maximum mass neutron star than that of the nuclear eos @xcite .",
    "in fact strangeness in the high - density baryonic matter is almost the inevitable consequence of pauli principle .",
    "strange degrees of freedom would be crucial for long time evolution of the pns @xcite also .",
    "the observation of massive compact stars with mass @xmath18 puts stringent constraint on the model of neutron stars and may abandon most of the soft eos .",
    "however , it is at present not possible to rule out all exotica with recent observation as many model calculations including hyperons and/or quark matter could still be compatible with the observations .",
    "many of these approaches are parameter dependent , for example the eos with hyperons are compatible with the benchmark of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "antikaon condensate is another possible strange candidate in the dense interior of neutron stars .",
    "it was first demonstrated by kaplan and nelson within a chiral @xmath19 model in dense matter formed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the isospin doublet for kaons is @xmath20 and that for antikaons @xmath21 .",
    "the attractive interaction in nuclear matter reduces the in - medium energy of ( anti)kaons ; at higher density eventually falls below the chemical potential of the leptons and replace them .",
    "antikaon condensation was later studied in details in the context of cold neutron star and protoneutron star @xcite in the rmf model , also in the density dependent rmf model@xcite .",
    "the net effect of @xmath22 condensates in neutron star matter is to maintain charge neutrality replacing electrons and to soften the eos resulting in the reduction of maximum mass of the neutron star @xcite , which was found to be within the observational limit .",
    "also the threshold of ( anti)kaon condensation is sensitive to antikaon optical potential and presence of charged hyperons pushes the threshold to higher densities . in a recent study both the approaches - density dependent couplings and higher order couplings in presence of ( anti)kaon condensates",
    "have been compared @xcite .",
    "all the parameter sets were found to produce @xmath2 neutron stars without antikaon condensate and some with antikaon condensate , but hyperons were not included in that study .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of antikaon condensation in beta equilibrated hyperon matter relevant to the dense interior of compact stars .",
    "here we work with less to moderately attractive antikaon optical potential depth .",
    "we also use @xmath23-meson for hyperonic and kaonic interaction .",
    "antikaon condensation in the presence of hyperon with additional @xmath23-meson has been studied previously @xcite , but not in the realistic density dependent framework . in this work",
    "we are interested to explore in a density dependent model whether this softening of eos that arises due to both antikaon condensation and hyperon , can still produce a @xmath2 neutron star within the observational limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i , we briefly describe the model to calculate the eos .",
    "the parameters of the model are listed in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to results and discussion .",
    "finally we summarise in section v.",
    "a phase transition from hadronic to antikaon condensed matter is considered here .",
    "this phase transition could be either a first order or second order transition .",
    "the hadronic phase is made of different species of the baryon octet along with electrons and muons making a uniform background . in the present approach , the model lagrangian density ( @xmath24 ) is of the form @xmath25 leptons are treated as non - interacting particles and described by the lagrangian density @xmath26 here @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is lepton spinor whereas @xmath29 denotes the baryon octet .",
    "baryons interact via the exchange of scalar @xmath30 , vector @xmath31 , @xmath32 mesons ; @xmath33 is the isospin operator .",
    "the field strength tensors for the vector mesons are given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 s , where @xmath37 and @xmath32 specify the coupling strength of the mesons with baryons and are vector density - dependent .",
    "the density operator @xmath38 has the form , @xmath39=@xmath40 , where @xmath41 . also , the meson - baryon couplings become function of total baryon density @xmath42 i.e. @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian structure closely follows the formalism of typel et al . @xcite .",
    "the above model has been extended to accommodate the whole baryon octet .",
    "the interaction of hyperons with the nucleons is considered through meson exchange just like the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "however , an additional vector meson @xmath23 and a scalar meson @xmath44 are also included , they are important for the the hyperon - hyperon interaction only @xcite .",
    "interaction among hyperons can be represented by the lagrangian density @xmath45 it has been reported that the attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction mediated by @xmath44 meson is very weak @xcite .",
    "we neglect the contribution of @xmath44 meson in this calculation .    using euler - lagrange relation the equations of motion for the meson and baryons fields",
    "are easily derived from the total lagrangian density ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the density dependence of the couplings while computing variation of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath29 gives rise to an additional term , which we denote by the rearrangement term @xcite .",
    "the meson field equations are solved self - consistently keeping into consideration the conditions for charge neutrality and baryon number conservation .",
    "we consider a static and isotropic matter in the ground state .",
    "for such a static system , all space and time derivatives of the fields vanish .",
    "also , in the rest frame of the matter the space components of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 vanish .",
    "furthermore , the third component of the isovector @xmath32 meson couples to baryons because the expectation values of the sources for charged @xmath32 mesons in the equation of motion also vanish in the ground state .",
    "it is to be noted @xmath23 mesons do not couple with nucleons i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "the meson field equations are solved in the mean - field approximation where the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values .",

    "the first term in the vector self - energy consists of the usual non - vanishing components of the vector mesons i.e. @xmath59 while the second term is the rearrangement term , which arises due to the density - dependence of meson - baryon couplings @xcite , assumes the form @xmath60~,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the isospin projection of @xmath64 . in the interior of neutron stars ,",
    "the baryons and leptons are in chemical equilibrium governed by the general equilibrium condition @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the baryon number and @xmath67 , the charge of @xmath68th baryon and @xmath69 is the chemical potential of neutron and @xmath70 is that of electron .",
    "this condition determines the threshold of a particular hyperon . as the chemical potential of the neutron and electron becomes sufficiently large at high density and eventually the threshold of hyperons",
    "is reached , they are populated .",
    "the chemical potential for the baryon b is @xmath71 .",
    "the term @xmath72 in @xmath73 is applicable for hyperons only .",
    "the energy density due to baryons can be explicitly expressed as @xmath74 however , the expression for pressure in addition contains the rearrangement term ( @xmath75 ) and is given by @xmath76 the pressure ( @xmath77 ) is related to the energy density ( @xmath78 ) in this phase through the gibbs - duhem relation @xmath79 the rearrangement term does not contribute to the energy density explicitly , whereas it occurs in the pressure through baryon chemical potentials .",
    "it is the rearrangement term that accounts for the energy - momentum conservation and thermodynamic consistency of the system @xcite .",
    "similarly , we calculate number densities , energy densities and pressures of electrons and muons .",
    "next we discuss the antikaon condensed phase composed of all the species of the baryon octet , the antikaon isospin doublet with electron and muons in the background .",
    "the baryon - baryon interaction in the antikaon condensed phase is described by the lagrangian density of eq .",

    "we choose the antikaon - baryon interaction on the same footing as the baryon - baryon interaction . the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme is given by @xcite @xmath80 where the covariant derivative is @xmath81 and the effective mass of ( anti)kaons is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the bare kaon mass .",

    "the in - medium energies of @xmath85 are given by @xmath87 it is to be noted that for @xmath88-wave ( * k*=0 ) @xmath89 condensation at t=0 , the scalar and vector densities of antikaons are same and those are given by @xcite @xmath90 the requirement of chemical equilibrium fixes the onset condition of antikaon condensations in neutron star matter .",

    "the meson field equations in the presence of antikaon condensates are given by @xmath95 antikaon condensates do not directly contribute to the pressure so it is due to baryons and leptons only .",
    "however , the presence of additional term due to ( anti)kaons in the meson field equations change the fields .",
    "also @xmath22 mesons modify the charge neutrality condition .",
    "thus the values of rearrangement term , pressure etc . are changed when the ( anti)kaons appear . the energy density of ( anti)kaons is given by @xmath96 .",
