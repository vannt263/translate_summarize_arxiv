    "the nucleon sigma terms are important quantities in resolving the dynamics of qcd , where they help to understand the role of explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the mass of the nucleon .",
    "indeed , the strangeness component plays a unique role in that is purely a vacuum polarization effect , analogous to the lamb shift in qed .",
    "further , the strange quark is light enough that it probes the nonperturbative distance scales of qcd . beyond the fundamental importance to nucleon structure ,",
    "the strange quark condensate in the nucleon is of significant interest in studies of the qcd phase structure at large baryon density @xcite and in constraining predicted cross sections for dark matter detection @xcite .",
    "the sigma terms of the nucleon are defined by the scalar form factors in the limit of vanishing momentum transfer , @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) , is related to @xmath2@xmath3 scattering through a chiral low - energy relation @xcite , @xmath4 where the experimental input required is the born - subtracted , isoscalar @xmath5 scattering amplitude evaluated at the ( unphysical ) cheng - dashen point , @xmath6 .",
    "the smallness of the up and down quark masses ensures that both the remainder term , @xmath7 @xcite , and the form factor correction , @xmath8 @xcite , can be reliably estimated .",
    "an early analysis of experimental results @xcite led to the value @xmath9 @xcite , while a more recent analysis suggested a higher value , @xmath10 @xcite .    unlike the light quarks , the strange quark is too heavy to invoke a low - energy relation .",
    "therefore @xmath11 has generally been estimated by studying the breaking of su(3 ) within the baryon octet @xcite . here ,",
    "the observed spectrum has been used to derive a constraint on the non - singlet combination @xmath12 where chiral effective field theory studies lead to a value @xmath13 @xcite , building on earlier estimates by gasser @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath14 and the extracted @xmath15 then defines the strange - quark contribution , @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , the relative strangeness component is often discussed in terms of the parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 taking the above pion - nucleon sigma term values and the estimated @xmath19 gives values @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and using a strange - to - light quark mass ratio of @xmath22 gives strangeness sigma terms , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this approach clearly leads to a result for @xmath11 which is very sensitive to the precise value of @xmath25 .",
    "we also note that even with perfect @xmath2@xmath3 data to better constrain @xmath25 , the @xmath26 uncertainty in @xmath19 alone leads to a @xmath27 uncertainty in @xmath11 .",
    "this limitation clearly opens the way for lattice qcd to offer significant improvement .",
    "in early lattice simulations , limited computing power forced the use of heavy quarks and the quenching of the light quarks in the theory @xcite .",
    "the first direct calculations of the disconnected contributions ( though still on a quenched gauge ensemble ) , including an estimate of the strange quark contributions , were performed in the work of fukugita  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and dong  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the @xmath2n sigma was found to be consistent with observation  see figure  [ fig : sig ] for a summary of results .",
    "the first determination using ( 2 flavours of ) dynamical quarks found a value for @xmath28 that is smaller than phenomenological expectations @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of this calculation is that consistent results were demonstrated between the direct calculation of the disconnected loops and that extracted from the fit to the nucleon mass , using the feynman - hellman relation @xmath29 while this calculation appeared to yield a value that was rather low , it was soon identified that the sigma term is particularly sensitive to chiral extrapolation @xcite . after this time ,",
    "most extractions of @xmath25 have come by application of the feynman - hellman relation to the mass extrapolation @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] ( -0.46,0.25),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    it was common in the early calculations that the quoted error only reflected the statistical uncertainty in the underlying extraction .",
    "the work of procura  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite made a detailed investigation of the systematic errors associated with the input parameters of their functional form .",
    "contrasting this with their earlier work @xcite , where only the statistical error was quoted , is a useful guide as to the potential size of systematic effects .",
    "of course , various systematics will continue to be better controlled as the simulation results improve .",
    "while it is not obvious from figure  [ fig : sig](a ) that the lattice results are showing convergence  without taking bias  there does appear to be consensus that the lattice results are consistent with the two phenomenological extractions discussed above .",
    "early lattice estimates of the strangeness sigma term supported the rather large values that had been inferred from phenomenology @xcite . going beyond the quenched approximation , the 2-flavour dynamical calculations of the sesam collaboration @xcite also supported the larger strangeness values , though with substantial uncertainty .",
    "another early calculation highlighted some of the challenges of resolving these matrix elements and concluded that the strangeness component is most likely rather small @xcite .",
    "while the strange quark in the 2-flavour simulations is essentially quenched , it is interesting to consider the light - quark disconnected diagrams , which are truly dynamical .",
    "one can consider the ratio of the disconnected to connected ( or sea to valence ) contributions to the sigma term , @xmath30 in the quenched simulations a relatively large value for this ratio was observed , with @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we note that the effect of unqenching appears to reduce this ratio , with the corrsponding ratio found to be @xmath33 in the dynamical simulation @xcite .",
    "this indicates a decrease in the relative strength of the disconnected component .    extending this discussion , a modern determination of this ratio by jlqcd @xcite has found @xmath34 ( taking pq - b as the `` best estimate '' )",
    " suggesting even further reduction of this ratio as results better describe the physical regime .",
    "this study constrained the nucleon mass using light - quark masses taking values over the range @xmath35@xmath36 ( or pion masses @xmath37@xmath38 ) .    in a su(3 ) symmetric ( @xmath39 ) 3-flavour dynamical calculation , the disconnected contributions of each of the three quarks are identical , satisfying the identity @xmath40 in a 2-flavour simulation , the literal @xmath41 contribution is zero , yet it could be reasonable to adopt the above relation to infer the @xmath41 from a 2-flavour calculation .",
    "indeed this is the approach taken by @xcite , where at the su(3 ) symmetric point one can infer @xmath42 .",
    "further taking the 2-flavour result for the increase in both the connected and disconnected light - quark terms as the light - quarks are reduced to the physical point reduces the estimate of @xmath17 to @xmath43 @xcite ( assuming that the strangeness term is only weakly dependent on the light - quark masses ) .",
    "indeed , when combined with their extraction for the @xmath15 , this leads to a significantly reduced value of the strangeness sigma term @xmath44 .",
    "the major cause of this reduction compared with the previous estimates comes from the observation that the derivative of the nucleon mass ( @xmath45 ) is quite strongly dependent on the sea - quark mass ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "indeed , this derivative was observed to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath4710 in going from the strange - quark mass to the light - quark mass . beyond the numerical improvements in the underlying lattice simulations ,",
    "this study has also incorporated the consequences of chiral symmetry breaking , where there are known to be substantial chiral logarithms in these derivatives  leading to the observed enhancement in the light - quark domain .",
    "these authors have recently reported results on testing their method against a direct calculation of the disconnected strangeness component , finding compatible results @xcite .",
    "further , the analysis of the jlqcd collaboration is being extended to 2 + 1 flavours of dynamical quarks , where preliminary results also support their 2-flavour findings @xcite .",
    "another opportunity to study the strange - quark mass dependence came with a series of calculations of the baryon spectrum in 2 + 1-flavour dynamical simulations which emerged in 2008 @xcite ( after an early venture in 2001 @xcite ) .",
    "these new 3-flavour results allowed tests of the su(3 ) chiral expansion at the lattice quark masses @xcite . indeed the poor convergence of the su(3 ) expansion , already recognised at the physical quark masses @xcite , was rediscovered on the lattice .",
    "these three chiral - lattice papers took three different approaches to deal with this problem .",
    "pacs - cs @xcite simply abondoned the su(3 ) formulation ; lhpc @xcite sacrificed the coefficients of the chiral logarithms in order to stabilise the fits ; we @xcite introduced a single new fit parameter that acts to separate the low- and high - energy contributions to the chiral loop integrals .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite built on the established benefits of using finite - range regularisation , which has previously been shown to dramatically improve the su(3 ) convergence @xcite and offer robust chiral extrapolation for lattice qcd @xcite . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the ability to extrapolate in both the light- and strange - quark masses to accurately reproduce the physical octet baryon spectrum , and also extrapolate to the heavier quark masses ( not used in the fits ) as calculated on the lattice .",
    "the results were found to be consistent with two different lattice discretizations , which also allowed an estimate of potential discretization effects .    using the feynman - hellman relation , we found @xmath25 to be compatible with phenomenological and lattice estimates . and",
    "the strangeness sigma term was identified to be relatively small , supporting the 2-flavour calculation of jlqcd @xcite .",
    "another recent 2 + 1-flavour dynamical result for @xmath11 has been reported by toussaint and freeman @xcite , using an application of the feynman - hellman relation on the nucleon correlator .",
    "this technique substantially differs from the approaches based on fitting the the nucleon mass and therefore provides a strong independent test .",
    "the result of toussaint and freeman @xcite is marginally higher than the values reported by jlqcd @xcite and by us @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as seen in figure  [ fig : sig](b ) , the modern lattice results for @xmath11 are in agreement that the size of the strangeness sigma term is substantially smaller than has been previously thought .",
    "as described above , the dominant uncertainty in knowledge of the scalar quark couplings has lies in the strangeness component .",
    "the current generation of lattice qcd calculations has primarily resolved this limitation by providing stringent new limits on the strange quark sigma term . as a result of this improvement , the predicted cross sections for models of dark matter can now be revised . in a recent paper ,",
    "giedt et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the impact of the new lattice qcd results on the cross sections for a class of supersymmetric models .",
    "the poorly known strangeness @xmath48-term had previously resulted in cross sections which varied by roughly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties have been dramatically reduced by the lattice calculations and importantly , one now has significant discrimination power between the ensemble of models considered .",
