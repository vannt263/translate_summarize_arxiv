    "in 1986 ghirardi , rimini and weber @xcite showed that it was possible to construct a realistic model describing explicit wavefunction collapse in such a way that , in many situations , the correct predictions of quantum theory were maintained but real experiments actually had results .",
    "their work has since been developed in a number of ways @xcite and it is generally agreed that it provides a satisfactory resolution of the measurement problem of quantum theory , at least in the non - relativistic domain . as originally presented , however , the model was clearly non - local and not lorentz invariant .",
    "recently , attempts have been made to develop versions of the collapse models which , whilst retaining the non - locality , are nevertheless lorentz invariant@xcite .",
    "perhaps the best one can say of these models is that they are partially successful .",
    "they certainly raise several interesting issues .    in this work",
    "we shall take a different approach and endeavour to construct a _",
    "local _ , and lorentz invariant version of the collapse model .",
    "we know of course that this can not agree in all respects with the predictions of orthodox quantum theory , and it is one object of this work to see where the disagreement lies and whether it is detectable . note that even the original grw model does not completely agree with quantum theory , and this requires severe constraints to be placed on the parameters @xcite .",
    "we are concerned here with a different type of departure from quantum theory , which is caused by our insistence on the theory being local .",
    "in the original grw model , it was proposed that ` hits ' occurred in a random fashion , at certain space - time points .",
    "the effect of a given hit spread throughout all space instantaneously .",
    "thus , if we have a single particle wavefunction @xmath0 , a hit at the point @xmath1 , would cause this to change according to : @xmath2    in order to make this into something that is both local and lorentz invariant , we propose instead that a hit at the space - time point @xmath3 only has an effect inside the forward light - cone from that point . to ensure lorentz invariance of the hitting function",
    ", we must replace the 3-dimensional distance in eq .",
    "( 1 ) by a four - dimensional distance .",
    "we can not use the distance from the hitting point to the point on the light - cone since this is identically zero .",
    "instead , we propose the perpendicular distance from the point on the light - cone to a four - momentum vector @xmath4 originating from @xmath5 , where perpendicular is meant in the sense of a minkowski metric . with @xmath6 , we define this momentum vector by : @xmath7 if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum , then this formula will just give the four - momentum of the particle .",
    "more generally it is the 4-vector form of the particle momentum used in the bohm hidden - variable model .    if we denote the vector from the light - cone to @xmath8 by @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) then the condition that it is perpendicular to @xmath8 is @xmath10 the path from @xmath11 to @xmath12 can be traversed in two ways , giving another condition @xmath13 for some @xmath14 .",
    "these two equations enable us to find the value of @xmath15 . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and using eq . (",
    "3 ) , we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 also , since @xmath18 is a null vector , eq . ( 4 ) gives @xmath19    we can rearrange these three equations to eliminate @xmath14 and , putting @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 this reduces to @xmath23 in the rest frame of the particle , @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore postulate that the collapse takes effect along the forward light cone from @xmath11 , according to @xmath25 this is our local analogue of eq .",
    "( 1 ) .    in what follows",
    ", we shall simplify the discussion by constraining the particle to a single spatial dimension ( z ) .",
    "ideally , we should take the wavefunction to be a solution of the dirac equation .",
    "however , we wish not to be concerned with any dirac bispinor , as the collapse process does not act on the space of spins . for a free particle",
    ", we can instead take the wavefunction to be a solution of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "we shall work with a single momentum for which the initial wavefunction is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is some normalization factor .",
    "given that the forward light - cone is the boundary under consideration , it is sensible to use light - cone coordinates , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the klein - gordon equation in this coordinate system reads @xmath30    then , if we choose the origin to be at the point of collapse , the boundary conditions in a general frame of reference are @xmath31    the solution of the klein - gordon equation inside the forward light - cone from the point of collapse is uniquely defined by these boundary conditions . in order to be able to write this down in a simple form",
    ", we shall ignore the quantum evolution , i.e. assume @xmath32 is very small . for simplicity , we work in the rest frame , in which @xmath33 .",
    "then we can write @xmath34 substituting this expression into the klein - gordon equation , we have @xmath35 where we have included all constants which had been previously set to unity .",
    "the right - hand - side is responsible for the quantum evolution .",
    "it can be treated as a perturbation @xcite . here",
    "we shall ignore it and just use the zeroth order solution which is @xmath36 .",
    "substituting in the boundary conditions leads us to a solution : @xmath37 within the forward light - cone of @xmath5 . outside of this region , the original free - particle solution holds .",
    "if we take the initial wavefunction to be a gaussian with a large spread , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , then the momentum states contributing will have @xmath40 .",
    "we should note that using the collapse radius for @xmath41 here gives @xmath42 , and we are justified in taking this to have a single momentum component .    to summarise this section",
    ", the effect of a single collapse on a single particle is the same as in the non - relativistic case , except that the effect is only felt within the forward light - cone of the point of origin of the collapse , @xmath11 .",
    "a major difference between our local collapse model and that of grw is that two independent collapses can occur at space - like separations so that neither collapse ` knows about ' the other .",
    "there is no problem with consistency until we arrive at the intersection of the light - cones arising from the two collapse centers . in the region formed by the forward light - cone originating from the point of intersection both collapses will be felt , and we need to define precisely how this happens .",
    "we shall take the two collapses to occur at the points @xmath43 and @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "before the point of intersection of the two light - cones , the wavefunction in the regions @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be calculated as in the previous section .",
    "after we reach the intersection point , @xmath47 , we shall solve the differential equation again with new boundary conditions along this third light - cone .",
    "the boundary conditions are formed , as indeed they were before , by taking the wavefunction outside of the light - cone , and multiplying by the collapse factor which arises from the collapse along that particular light - cone .",
    "thus , for the boundary condition along @xmath48 we take the wavefunction in the region @xmath45 , which is @xmath49 , and multiply by the collapse factor arising from the collapse at @xmath50 along @xmath51 .",
    "hence @xmath52 and simliarly along @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the perpendicular four - distances from the momentum vectors arising from the collapses at @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .    in general ,",
    "for an arbitrary initial wavefunctions the momentum vectors arising from each point will be different . even ignoring the quantum evolution",
    ", this could lead to solutions of the differential equation which are quite complicated . for simplicity",
    ", we shall deal with the case when the momenta arising from each collapse center are equal .",
    "in this situation , we can again work in the frame where @xmath59 .",
    "this means that the boundary conditions are ( having extracted the plane - wave term and normalization as before ) : @xmath60 along @xmath61 , and @xmath62 along @xmath63 .",
    "we are only interested in the zeroth order solution to the differential equation , eq .",
    "( 16 ) , so of course we have @xmath64 , as before . substituting the boundary conditions , we find that @xmath65\\right),\\ ] ] which may be rewritten as @xmath66\\right),\\ ] ] leading to a wavefunction @xmath67    here we find that , in this case , the two collapses are equivalent to a single collapse at the point @xmath68 , but with twice the ` strength ' .",
    "this is certainly what would be expected in the non - relativistic limit if we were to have two collapses , although this solution only holds in the forward light - cone of the intersection point @xmath69 .",
    "it should be noted that in the non - relativistic situation , the wavefunction at the point of the second collapse would have already been reduced by the first , so the probability of the second collapse occurring would be very small .",
    "we now briefly consider the question of the order of the two collapses .",
    "take the situation shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the collapse at @xmath57 happens later than the collapse at @xmath58 , in the frame in which @xmath33 . the relative size of the two peaks depends on the distances from @xmath57 to @xmath70 and @xmath58 to @xmath71 .",
    "as can be seen from the diagram , these distances are of course equal , so the exponentials by which we multiply the two wavefunctions will be equal , at the two peaks , and thus as the wavefunction is not time - dependent , the two peaks will have the same size .",
    "the order of the collapses is immaterial when we have a single momentum component .",
    "we now want to examine a typical measurement situation , where the initial wavefunction is a sum of two well - separated peaks , e.g. @xmath72,\\ ] ] with @xmath73 .",
    "so any collapse which occurs will , with probability essentially one , be centered around one of the two peaks of the wavefunction .",
    "an important property of the grw - type models which we retain is that the probability of a collapse occurring at a point @xmath74 is proportional to @xmath75 ; with a single collapse , the wavefunction will be reduced to a single peak in a time @xmath76 .    however , as before , the relativistic model allows the possibility of there being two collapse events , one centered on each peak , providing that each collapse event is outside of the forward light - cone of the other . on a constant time slice",
    ", there may persist peaks in each region , but we are predominately concerned with the shape of the wavefunction at later times , i.e. after the intersection of the two forward light - cones .",
    "we assume that the momentum vectors defined at the two collapse points are ( to a sufficiently good approximation ) the same , so that we can again work in the frame for which @xmath59 .",
    "then , with the same approximations as before , the final state wavefunction will just be the initial state wavefunction multiplied by the collapse functions arising from the spatially separated collapses .",
    "this final state wavefunction can be written as @xmath77,\\ ] ] and we again have the two peaks , only now their centers have been shifted , according to @xmath78    obviously if the peaks were very sharp in the initial wavefunction , then the shift will be quite small",
    ". however , it is certainly possible that the shift will be sufficient for the new peak to lie well into the tail of the initial peak , where it would have been extremely unlikely that the particle could be found",
    ". this will be the case if @xmath79 . for a pair of sharp initial peaks , and @xmath80",
    ", this reads @xmath81 .",
    "in general we might expect the localization of the two peaks to be less than , but of the order of , the grw collapse size , i.e. @xmath82 but of the same order .",
    "this means that the peaks are shifted by something around @xmath83 of their separation .",
    "in orthodox quantum theory , the probability that a measurement outcome will correspond to one of 2 peaks is proportional to the square integral of the weight of each peak .",
    "the same result holds in grw , where it is a consequence of the probability rule for a hit occurring at a particular point @xcite .",
    "here we shall again guarantee this result , _ for a single collapse _",
    ", by postulating that the probability of this collapse occurring at one of the peaks is proportional to the integral of the square of the wavefunction over the peak",
    ". thus with an initial state ( in the rest frame ) : @xmath84,\\ ] ] with @xmath85 , the collapse will occur near @xmath86 or @xmath87 in the ratio of @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "however , we now have to consider carefully the possibility of more than one collapse occurring .",
    "this means of course that both peaks can change their magnitudes .",
    "we take account of this by allowing @xmath41 and @xmath90 in eq . (",
    "30 ) to be functions of time .",
    "consistent with the requirement of a _ local _ model we postulate that the probability of a collapse at @xmath86 at time @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , the retarded time .",
    "the probability of a particular peak persisting depends of course on the number of collapses that occur , and the time taken for the signal of a collapse to reach the other peak(@xmath94 ) .",
    "here we shall evaluate the probability of peak 1 dominating .",
    "there will be contributions to this probability from all possible numbers of collapses .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath95 , and so make an expansion in this parameter .",
    "we shall calculate the first three terms in this series , i.e. work to order @xmath96 .",
    "the collapse processes which contribute to this order are illustrated in fig .",
    "the separation of the two peaks is @xmath97 . in order to assess the probability of a collapse occuring on a particular peak , we look at the relative sizes of the peaks along the backward light - cone . in the figure ,",
    "the solid vertical lines indicate where a collapse on the peak is possible , whereas the dotted lines indicate that a collapse is not possible . when a collapse is deemed possible , the probabilities for each side will be @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , if both can occur , or 1 and 0 if only one of these is possible . we need to calculate the probability contributions from each diagram separately .",
    "* diagram ( i ) * in this case a single collapse is successful .",
