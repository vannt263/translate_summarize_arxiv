    "within a given taxonomic group , individual biological species are generally considered to be of equal or near - equal biodiversity value .",
    "so , for instance , areas with a greater number of species are more valuable than those with fewer ( myers et al .",
    "when wild species are ranked by value , this is usually based on their threat of extinction ( see , e.g. sara 2002 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by cousins ( 1991 ) , species are discovered and identified because they are different from other species , which suggests that they may differ in value . in the context of conservation , avise ( 2005 )",
    "has highlighted five different currencies for valuing species : rarity , distribution , ecology , charisma , and phylogeny .",
    "here , we consider the value of a species based on its position in a phylogeny .",
    "a phylogeny is the directional , acyclic graph depicting relationships between leaves ( species ) , which we define formally in the next section .",
    "a phylogeny generally has a root ( which assigns direction ) and edge weights that can represent unique feature diversity ( e.g. as measured by evolutionary time or genetic distance ) .",
    "species can be defined by the features they possess , and one measure of their worth is their expected contribution of unique features . in this way",
    ", we can use a phylogeny to assign a measure of evolutionary value to a species based on its expected contribution of unique features . because of the highly imbalanced shape of the tree of life , some species in a phylogeny will have far fewer close relatives than others in that phylogeny ( mooers and heard 1997 ) , and these more distantly - related species will be expected to contribute more unique features ( faith 1992 ) .",
    "phylogenetic measures of conservation value have a long pedigree ( see , e.g. alschul and lipman 1990 ; may 1990 ) and have begun to be explored in some detail ( haake et al .",
    "2005 ; hartmann and steel 2007 ; pavoine et al .",
    ", 2005_b _ ; redding and mooers 2006 ) .",
    "so , for example , pavoine and colleagues presented one new measure of originality , a set of sampling weights such that the expected pairwise distance on the tree is maximized .",
    "haake and colleagues extended the ` shapley value ' ( shapley 1953 ) from co - operative game theory to the conservation setting to calculate the average distance of a focal species to all possible subsets of taxa .",
    "for both measures , more original species are those expected to contribute more to the resulting sets .",
    "yet another measure that uniquely apportions the tree to its tips ( isaac et al . 2007 ) and which is the focus of a new international conservation initiative ( the edge initiative , zoological society of london ) scales almost perfectly with the shapley value ( unpublished results ) .",
    "one question with these measures concerns the sets that individual species are asked to complement .",
    "for instance , given known extinction probabilities for species , some future sets are much more likely than others and so some species will be more valuable because their close relatives are less likely to be included in future sets . here",
    "we formalize this idea to extend the shapley value of a species to include pre - assigned extinction probabilities .",
    "we then compare our measure with the original shapley value using the prosimian primates as a test case .",

    "we consider the simplest model which assumes that the extinction of each species in @xmath1 comprise independent events . given @xmath12 , let @xmath19 denote the random subset of species in @xmath20 which survive ( i.e. do not go extinct ) .    by the independence assumption",

    "notice that if all the species in @xmath20 were guaranteed to survive , then @xmath22 would be just the length of the pendant edge incident with leaf @xmath16 , however random extinctions mean that @xmath22 will tend to be increased ( ` heightened ' ) over this pendant edge length .",
    "a related but different index , based on the shapley value in co - operative game theory , has recently been described by haake et al .",
    "this index , denoted here as @xmath26 can be defined ( for unrooted trees ) as follows : for @xmath12 , @xmath27 this index has certain appealing properties . in particular , @xmath28 , and",
    "there is a simple formula for quickly computing @xmath29 .",
    "the index @xmath26 also has a stochastic interpretation , but this is not based on extinction or survival of species , rather on the expected contribution to @xmath30 of each species under all possible orderings of the total set of species ( for details see haake et al .",
    "the index @xmath31 allocates existing @xmath30 ` fairly ' amongst the species , whereas @xmath32 quantifies the expected contribution of each species to future @xmath30 .",
    "computing the he d index directly via ( [ defeq ] ) could be problematic as it requires summation over all the subsets of @xmath20 and this grows exponentially with @xmath33 .",
    "however we now show that the index can be readily and quickly computed , both for rooted and unrooted trees .",
    "this polynomial - time algorithm for computing @xmath32 thus complements ( but is quite different to ) the polynomial - time algorithm described by haake et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for computing @xmath26",
    ".      for a rooted phylogenetic @xmath1tree @xmath0 let @xmath34 denote the set of species in @xmath1 that are descended from @xmath3 ( i.e. the clade that results from deleting @xmath3 from @xmath0 ) .",
    "for @xmath12 , let @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) denote the edges ( branches ) on the path from @xmath16 to the root of @xmath0 , listed in the order they are visited by that path .",

    "thus the first term in the summation expression for @xmath22 given by theorem  [ th1 ] is simply @xmath41 , the length of the pendant edge of @xmath0 incident with species @xmath16 .",
    "we can apply the he d index to the members of the rooted tree depicted in fig .",
    "1 . for example",
    ", to compute @xmath42 by using theorem  [ th1 ] we have @xmath43 . by inspection",
    ", we can see that the most valuable species will be @xmath44 , since it shares an edge with only one other species above the root , and that this species ( @xmath45 ) has a high @xmath17 . at the other extreme ,",
    "@xmath46 shares its path to the root with two other species , and one of them ( @xmath47 ) has a low @xmath17 .",
    "it should therefore receive a low he d value .",
    "the computed values are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . using the shapley index ( haake et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are ranked first ( with value = 2.63 ) , followed by @xmath47 ( 2.33 ) and then @xmath46 and @xmath53 ( 1.75 ) .",
    "pavoine s qe metric ( pavoine et al . 2005 ) returns the same ranking as does the shapley .",
    "a portal for computing he d is available at http://www.disconti.nu/-phylo/emd.dpf      we now provide a similar formula for efficiently computing the he d index for unrooted trees . given a leaf @xmath16 of @xmath0 and an edge @xmath3 of @xmath0 , @xmath3 induces a split of @xmath1 into two disjoint subsets , and one of these subsets , which we denote as @xmath54 , contains @xmath16 .",
    "the proof of the following theorem is given in the appendix .",
    "[ th2 ] @xmath55    notice that the rooted he d index is just a special case of the unrooted he d index ( indeed theorem  [ th1 ] can be deduced from theorem  [ th2 ] ) . to see this , given a rooted tree @xmath0 attach a new leaf @xmath56 to the root via a new edge to obtain an unrooted tree , and assign the new edge length @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 .",
    "then it is easily seen that the he d index for @xmath0 is just the he d index for the derived unrooted tree .    using theorem  [ th1 ]",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath0 is a rooted phylogenetic tree then the condition : @xmath59 holds for all selections of positive branch lengths and @xmath60 s if and only if @xmath0 is a ` star tree ' ( that is , every leaf is adjacent to the root ) .",
    "moreover theorem  [ th2 ] shows that there is no unrooted phylogenetic tree @xmath0 for which ( [ pareto ] ) holds for all positive branch lengths and @xmath60 values ( of course ( [ pareto ] ) may hold on phylogenetic trees  either rooted or unrooted  if the branch lengths and @xmath60 values take certain values ) .",
    "this contrasts with the index @xmath26 which satisfies @xmath61 on all unrooted phylogenetic trees and choices of branch lengths , a property that is referred to as the pareto efficiency axiom by haake et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in the setting of this paper",
    "we should not be surprised that ( [ pareto ] ) holds for @xmath32 only in very special cases since we are not trying to divide out existing @xmath30 amongst present taxa ( one motivation behind @xmath26 ) but rather quantify the expected contribution each species makes to future @xmath30 .",
    "we compared the he d index with the shapley ( haake et al . 2005 ) values for the prosimians ( mammalia : primata ) , a group of approximately 50 species with a broad range of extinction probabilities .",
    "this group includes the aye - aye , the lemurs , the lorises and galagos .",
    "we made use of a recent dated supertree of the order primates ( vos and mooers 2004 ; vos 2006 ) , see fig . 2 , and red list risk designations from the iucn ( www.iucnredlist.org , accessed february 2006 ) .",
    "following isaac et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and redding and mooers ( 2006 ) , we first converted the five categories of risk ( cr , en , vu , nt , and lc ) to probabilities of extinction . under the iucn criteria ,",
    "the species in the vu category are given a @xmath17=0.1 over the next 100 years .",
    "we gave the lowest and highest threat categories very conservative probabilities of extinction over the next 100 years of 0.001 and 0.9 respectively , leaving @xmath62 for en , and @xmath63 for nt : this scale is very similar to that calculated from real population viability analyses for birds ( redding and mooers 2006 ) .",
    "we are primarily interested in how the ranking of species changes using different approaches .    : critically endangered , @xmath64 ; @xmath65 : endangered , @xmath62 ; @xmath66 : vulnerable , @xmath67 ; @xmath68 : near threatened , @xmath63 ; @xmath69 : least concern , @xmath70 .",
    "edge lengths are on an arbitrary scale that represents time since divergence . ]",
    "the bivariate correlation between the metrics is high ( 0.94 )",
    ". both measures chose the aye - aye ( @xmath71 @xmath72 ) as the most important species , followed by @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "interestingly , the three most highly ranked species under current conservation policy ( the critically endangered lemurs @xmath75 @xmath76 , @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 @xmath80 ) are nested well up in the tree ( figure 2 ) such that none of them were chosen in the top ten for either sv or he d .",
    "if we compare the rest of the rankings for these two metrics , the largest single difference is for the two @xmath81 species : they rank twelfth under sv ( being relatively isolated on the tree ) , but only twenty - sixth under he d : because neither is severely threatened , the chances are good that their common path will persist .",
    "both measures are very heavily influenced by the pendant edge ( @xmath82 ) length of the focal species ( with correlations @xmath82 vs. sv=0.94 , and @xmath82 vs. hed=0.98 ) .",
    "@xmath83 is always part of the marginal increase to @xmath5 , while interior nodes are most likely represented with high probability , especially for larger and more balanced trees .",
    "@xmath82 is , however , a poor predictor of he d for @xmath75 , for @xmath79 @xmath84 , and for @xmath85 @xmath86 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the first two groups contain the three most endangered species , increasing the value of close relatives .",
    "@xmath85 is an isolated genus , and @xmath87 s sister species is listed as vulnerable ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "likewise for @xmath88 - although it has close relatives and so a short pe , these relatives are at high risk of extinction , which increases its value ; this is what we saw with species @xmath44 in figure 1 .",
    "the effect of close relatives risk status on one s own value is precisely the strength of the he d approach .",
    "however , the fact that the extinction risk of other species affects a focal species , but its own risk does not is somewhat counter - intuitive . we address this by showing how it is possible to write the he d index as the sum of two terms each of which takes into account the extinction risk of the focal species . to describe this further ,",
    "let @xmath89 be the random variable which takes the value @xmath16 if the focal species @xmath16 survives ( at the future time under consideration ) and which otherwise takes the value of the emptyset ( i.e. @xmath90 ) if @xmath16 goes extinct .",
    "let @xmath91,\\ ] ] where , as before @xmath19 is the random subset of species in @xmath20 that survive . in words , @xmath92 is the increase in the expected pd score if we condition on the event that species @xmath16 survives .",
    "similarly , let @xmath93.\\ ] ] in words , @xmath94 is the decrease in the expected pd score if we condition on the event that species @xmath16 becomes extinct .",
    "the following result describes how to compute these two indices easily from the he d index , and verifies that they add together to give the he d index ( its proof is given in the appendix ) .",
    "[ th3 ]    * @xmath95 , * @xmath96 , * @xmath97 .    the approach of assigning a value to a species which is a function of its phylogenetic distinctiveness and its extinction probability has been referred to as ` expected loss ' by redding and mooers ( 2006 ) and , more evocatively , an ` edge ' score ( evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered ) by isaac et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    in the same spirit",
    "we will call @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( which extend our he d index @xmath32 ) hedge ( _ heightened evolutionary distinctiveness and globally endangered _ ) scores .",
    "the hedge score @xmath92 is more relevant when evaluating actions that might save species , whereas the hedge score @xmath94 is appropriate when evaluating actions that might cause the extinction of species ( such as building a dam ) .    one potential advantage of he d and hedge over previous scores is their flexibility in designing conservation scenarios .",
    "so for instance , we can choose iucn - ranked species for which conservation is cheap and/or already partially successful , set their @xmath17 to 0 , and see how rankings of other species change .",
    "alternatively , we might want to increase the @xmath17 to 1.0 for certain species to see how others are affected .",
    "most generally , he d and hedge could be incorporated in an assessment of species value that included many factors besides risk and future contribution , e.g. the ecological , distributional and aesthetic values enumerated by avise ( 2005 ) , and the costs of recovery and probability of its success .",
    "_ proof of theorem  [ th1 ] _    first observe that the only edge lengths that contribute to @xmath15 are those from the set @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , for the random set @xmath19 of surviving species of @xmath20 we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the @xmath103 indicator random variable that takes the value @xmath8 precisely if @xmath104 is not an edge of the subtree of @xmath0 connecting the taxa in @xmath19 and the root of @xmath0 ; since this is the only situation for which @xmath104 lies in the subtree of @xmath0 connecting @xmath105 but not in the subtree of @xmath0 connecting @xmath19 .",
    "thus , by linearity of expectation , @xmath106 = { { \\mathbb e}}[\\sum_{r\\geq 1 } l(e_r ) \\cdot i_r({\\mathcal s}_i ) ] = \\sum_{r\\geq 1 } l(e_r ) \\cdot { { \\mathbb e}}[i_r({\\mathcal s}_i)],\\ ] ] and since @xmath102 takes the values @xmath57 and @xmath8 , @xmath107 = { { \\mathbb p}}[i_r({\\mathcal s}_i)=1]$ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath108.\\ ] ] now , the event ` @xmath109 ' occurs precisely if none of the elements in @xmath40 survive , and this latter event has probability @xmath110 .",
