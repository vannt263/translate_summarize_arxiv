    "in the modern mathematical literature , catalan numbers are wonderfully ubiquitous .",
    "although they appear in a variety of disguises , we are so used to having them around , it is perhaps hard to imagine a time when they were either unknown or known but obscure and underappreciated",
    ". it may then come as a surprise that catalan numbers have a rich history of multiple rediscoveries until relatively recently .",
    "below we review over 200 years of history , from their first discovery to modern times .",
    "we break the history into short intervals of mathematical activity , each covered in a different section .",
    "we spend most of our effort on the early history , but do bring it to relatively recent developments .",
    "we should warn the reader that although this work is in the history of mathematics , we are not a mathematical historian . rather , this work is more of a historical survey with some added speculations based on our extensive reading of the even more extensive literature . due to the space limitations ,",
    "this survey is very much incomplete , as we tend to emphasize first discoveries and papers of influence rather than describe subsequent developments .",
    "this paper in part is based on our earlier investigation reported in  @xcite .",
    "many primary sources are assembled on the _ catalan numbers website _",
    "@xcite , including scans of the original works and their english translations .",
    "ming antu , sometimes written mingantu ( c.1692c.1763 ) was a chinese scientist and mathematician , native of inner mongolia . in 1730s , he wrote a book _ quick methods for accurate values of circle segments _ which included a number of trigonometric identities and power series , some involving catalan numbers : @xmath0 the integrality of catalan numbers played no role in this work .",
    "ming antu s book was published only in 1839 , and the connection to catalan numbers was observed by luo jianjin in 1988 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for more on this work and further references .",
    "in 1751 , leonhard euler ( 17071783 ) introduced and found a closed formula for what we now call the _",
    "catalan numbers_. the proof of this result had eluded him , until he was assisted by christian goldbach ( 16901764 ) , and more substantially by johann segner . by  1759 , a complete proof was obtained .",
    "this and the next section tell the story of how this happened .    on september  4 , 1751 , euler wrote a letter to goldbach which among other things included his discovery of catalan numbers .",
    "euler was in berlin ( prussia ) at that time , while his friend and former mentor goldbach was in st .",
    "petersburg ( imperial russia ) .",
    "they first met when euler arrived to st .",
    "petersburg back in 1727 as a young man , and started a lifelong friendship , with 196 letters between them  @xcite .",
    "euler defines catalan numbers @xmath1 as the number of triangulations of @xmath2-gon , and gives the values of @xmath1 for @xmath3 ( evidently , computed by hand ) .",
    "all these values , including @xmath4 are correct .",
    "euler then observes that successive ratios have a pattern and guesses the following formula for catalan numbers : @xmath5 for example , @xmath6 .",
    "he concludes with the formula for the catalan numbers g.f .  :",
    "@xmath7    in his reply to euler dated october 16 , 1751 , goldbach notes that the g.f .",
    "@xmath8 satisfies quadratic equation @xmath9 he then suggests that this equation can be used to derive catalan numbers via an infinite family of equations on its coefficients .",
    "euler writes back to goldbach on december 4 , 1751 .",
    "there , he explains how one can obtain the product formula   from the binomial formula : @xmath10 from the context of the letter , it seems that euler knew the exact form of   before his investigation of the catalan numbers .",
    "thus , once he found the product formula  , he was able to derive   rather than simply guess it .",
    "we believe that euler did not include his derivation in the first letter as the g.f .",
    "formula appears at the very end of it , but once goldbach became interested he patiently explained all the steps , as well as other similar formulas .",
    "johann andreas von segner ( 17041777 ) was another frequent correspondent of euler .",
    "although segner was older , euler rose to prominence faster , and in 1755 crucially helped him to obtain a position at university of halle , see  @xcite .",
    "it seems , there was a bit of competitive tension between them , which adversely affected the story .    in the late 1750s , euler suggested to segner the problem of counting the number of triangulations of an @xmath11-gon .",
    "we speculate based on segner s later work , that euler told him only values up to  @xmath12 , and neither the product formula   nor the g.f .  .",
    "segner accepted the challenge and in 1758 wrote a paper  @xcite , whose main result is a recurrence relation which he finds and proves combinatorially : @xmath13 he then uses the formula to compute the values of  @xmath1 , @xmath14 , but makes an arithmetic mistake in computing @xmath15 , which then invalidates all larger values .",
    "euler must have realized that equation   is the last missing piece necessary to prove  .",
    "he arranged for segner s paper to be published in the journal of st .",
    "petersburg academy of sciences , but with his own _ summary _  @xcite . in it , he states  , gives segner a lavish compliment , then points out his numerical mistake , and correctly computes all @xmath1 for @xmath16 .",
    "it seems unlikely that given the simple product formula , segner would have computed @xmath17 incorrectly , so we assume that euler shared it only with his close friend goldbach , and kept segner in the dark until after the publication .    in summary ,",
    "a combination of results of euler and segner , combined with goldbach s observation gives a complete proof of the product formula  .",
    "unfortunately , it took about 80  years until the first complete proof was published .",

    "petersburg all his life . in 1766 , soon after the raid on berlin , euler returned to st .",
    "same year , kotelnikow writes a paper  @xcite elaborating on catalan numbers . although he claimed to have another way to verify  , larcombe notes that he `` does little more than play around with the formula ''  @xcite .",
    "nicolas fuss ( 17551826 ) was a swiss born mathematician who moved to st .",
    "petersburg to become euler s assistant in  1773 .",
    "he married euler s granddaughter , became a well known mathematician in his own right , and remained in russia until death . in his 1795 paper  @xcite , in response to pfaff s question on the number of subdivisions of an @xmath11-gon into @xmath18-gons , fuss introduced what is now know as the _ fuss  catalan numbers _ ( see exercise  a14 ) , and gave a generalization of segner s formula  , but not the product formula .",
    "in 1836 , a young french mathematician joseph liouville ( 18091882 ) founded the _ journal de mathmatiques pures et appliques_. he was in the center of mathematical life in paris and maintained a large mailing list , which proved critical in this story .    in 1838 , a jewish french mathematician and mathematical historian olry terquem ( 17821862 ) asked liouville if he knows a simple way to derive euler s formula   from segner s recurrence  .",
    "liouville in turn communicated this problem to `` various geometers '' .",
    "what followed is a remarkable sequence of papers giving foundation to `` catalan studies '' .",
    "first , gabriel lam ( 17951870 ) wrote a letter to liouville outlining the solution , a letter liouville promptly published in the _ journal _ and further popularized  @xcite .",
    "lam s solution was to use an elegant double counting argument .",
    "let s count the number @xmath19 of triangulations of an @xmath2-gon with one of its @xmath20 diagonals oriented .",
    "on the one hand , @xmath21 . on the other hand , by summing over all possible directed diagonals we have @xmath22 combining these two formulas with   easily implies  .    in 1738 ,",
    "belgium born mathematician eugne charles catalan ( 18141894 ) was a student of liouville at cole polytechnique .",
    "inspired by the work of lam , he became interested in the problem .",
    "he was the first to obtain what are now standard formulas @xmath23 he then studied the problem of computing the number of different ( non - associative ) products of @xmath11 variables , equivalent to counting the number of bracket sequences  @xcite .",
    "olinde rodrigues ( 17951851 ) was a descendant of a large sephardic jewish family from bordeaux .",
    "he received his doctorate in mathematics and had a career as a banker in paris , but continued his mathematical interests .",
    "in the same volume of the _ journal _ , he published two back - to - back short notes giving a more direct double counting proof of  . the first note  @xcite gives a variation on lam s argument , a beautiful idea often regarded a folklore .",
    "roughly , he counts in two ways the number @xmath24 of triangulations of @xmath2-gon where either an edge or a diagonal is oriented . on the one hand , @xmath25 . on the other hand , @xmath26",
    ", since triangulations with an oriented diagonal are in bijection with triangulations of @xmath27-gon obtained by inserting a triangle in place of a diagonal , and such edge can be any edge except the first one .",
    "we omit the details .    in  @xcite , rodrigues gives a related , but even simpler argument for counting the bracket sequences .",
    "denote by @xmath28 the number of bracket sequences of labeled terms @xmath29 , e.g. @xmath30 .",
    "then , on the one hand @xmath31 . on the other hand , @xmath32 since",
    "variable @xmath33 can be inserted into every bracket sequence in exactly @xmath34 ways . to see this , place a bracket around every variable and the whole product , e.g. @xmath35 .",
    "now observe that a new variable is inserted immediately to the left of any of the @xmath36 left brackets , or immediately to the right of any of the @xmath36 right brackets , e.g. @xmath37    in 1839 , clearly unaware of euler s letters , a senior french mathematician jacques binet ( 17861856 ) wrote a paper  @xcite with a complete g.f .",
    "proof of  . across the border in germany , johann august grunert ( 17971872 ) became interested in the work of the frenchmen on the one hand , and of fuss on the other .",
    "a former student of pfaff , in a 1841 paper  @xcite he found a product formula for the fuss  catalan numbers .",
    "he employed g.f.s to reduce the problem to @xmath38 but seemed unable to finish the proof .",
    "the complete proof was given in 1843 by liouville  @xcite using the _ lagrange inversion _",
    "( see  @xcite ) .",
    "after a few more mostly analytic papers inspired by the problem , the attention of the french school turned elsewhere .",
    "catalan however returned to the problem on several occasions throughout his career .",
    "even fifty years later , in 1878 , he published _",
    "sur les nombres de segner _",
    "@xcite on divisibility of the catalan numbers .",
    "thomas kirkman ( 18061895 ) was a british ordained minister who had a strong interest in mathematics . in 1857 , unaware of the previous work but with cayley s support , he published a lengthy treatise  @xcite .",
    "there , he introduced the _ kirkman  cayley numbers _ , defined as the number of ways to divide an @xmath11-gon with @xmath18 non - intersecting diagonals ( see  a41 ) , and states a general product formula , which he proves in a few special cases .",
    "in 1857 , arthur cayley ( 18211895 ) was a lawyer in london and extremely prolific mathematically .",
    "he was interested in a related counting of _ plane trees _ , and in 1859 published a short note  @xcite , where ( among other things ) he gave a conventional g.f .",
    "proof of that the number of plane trees is the catalan number . like kirkman , he was evidently unaware of the previous work .",

    "for the _ ordered bell numbers_.    in 1860 , cayley won a professorship in cambridge and soon became a central figure in british mathematics .",
    "few years later , henry martyn taylor ( 18421927 ) became a student in cambridge , where he remained much of his life , working in geometry , mathematical education and politics . in 1882 , he and r.  c.  rowe published a paper  @xcite where they carefully examined the literature of the french school , but gave an erroneous description of the euler  segner story .",
    "they evidently missed later papers by grunert and liouville , and computed the fuss ",
    "catalan numbers along similar lines , using the lagrange inversion , see  @xcite .",
    "cayley continued exploring g.f .",
    "methods for a variety of enumerative problems , among over 900 papers he wrote . in 1891 , cayley used g.f .  tour de force to completely resolve kirkman s problem  @xcite .",
    "the _ ballot numbers _ were first defined by catalan in  1839 , disguised as the number of certain triangulations  @xcite .",
    "we believe this contribution was largely forgotten since catalan gave a formula for the ballot numbers in terms of the catalan numbers , but neither gave a closed formula nor even a table of the first few values .",
    "the ballot sequences were first introduced in 1878 by william allen whitworth ( 18401905 ) , a british mathematician , a priest and a fellow at cambridge .",
    "he resolved the problem completely by an elegant counting argument and found interesting combinatorial applications  @xcite . despite both geographical and mathematical proximity to cayley",
    ", he did not notice that the numbers @xmath40 he computed are the catalan numbers .    in modern terminology , the _ ballot problem _ was introduced in 1887 by joseph bertrand ( 18221900 ) .",
    "in a half a page note  @xcite , he defined the probability @xmath41 that in an election with @xmath42 voters , a candidate who gathered @xmath43 votes is always leading the candidate with @xmath11 votes .",

    "he published an elegant proof of bertrand s theorem  @xcite in the same 1887 volume of _ comptes rendu _ as bertrand and barbier . although he is often credited with the _ reflection method _ , this attribution is incorrect , as andre s proof was essentially equivalent to that by whitworth ( cf .",
    "the reflection principle is in fact due to dmitry semionovitch mirimanoff ( 18611945 ) , a russian - swiss mathematician who discovered it in 1923 , in a short note  @xcite .",
    "andre s original proof was clarified and extended to barbier s proposed generalization in  @xcite .",

    "despite a large literature , for decades the catalan numbers remained largely unknown and unnamed in contrast with other celebrated sequences , such as the fibonacci and bernoulli numbers .",
    "yet the number of publications on catalan numbers was growing rapidly , so much that we can not attempt to cover even a fraction of them . here",
    "are few major appearances .",
    "the first monograph citing the catalan numbers is the _ thorie des nombres _ by douard lucas ( 18421891 ) , published in paris in 1891 . despite the title , the book had a large combinatorial content , including rodrigues s proof of catalan s combinatorial interpretation in terms of brackets and products  @xcite .",
    "the next notable monograph is the _ lehrbuch der combinatorik _ by eugen netto ( 18481919 ) , published in leipzig in  1901 .",
    "this is one of the first combinatorics monographs ; it includes a lot of material on permutations and combinations , and it devotes several sections to the papers by catalan , rodrigues and some related work by schrder  @xcite .    we should mention that these monographs were more the exception than the rule .",
    "many classical combinatorial books do not mention catalan numbers at all , most notably percy macmahon , _ combinatorial analysis _ ( 1915/6 ) , john riordan , _ an introduction to combinatorial analysis _ ( 1958 ) , and h.  j.  ryser , _ combinatorial mathematics _ ( 1963 ) .",
    "a crucial contribution was made by william g.  brown in  1965 , when he recognized and collected a large number of references on the `` euler  segner problem '' and the `` pfaff  fuss problem '' , as he called them  @xcite . to denote the catalan numbers . ] from this point on , hundreds of papers involving catalan numbers have been published and all standard textbooks started to include it ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath453.2 ) and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath453 ) for an early adoption ) .",
    "some 465 references were assembled by henry  w.  gould in a remarkable bibliography  @xcite , which first appeared in  1971 and revised in  2007 . at about that time , various lists of combinatorial interpretations of catalan numbers started to appear , see e.g.  @xcite , appendix  1 and a very different kind of list in  @xcite .",
    "because of their chaotic history , the catalan numbers have received this name relatively recently . in the old literature",
    ", they were sometimes called the _ segner numbers _ or the _ euler  segner numbers _ , which is historically accurate as their articles were the first published work on the subject . perhaps surprisingly , we are able to tell exactly who named them _ catalan numbers _ and when .",
    "our investigation of this _ eponymy _ is informal , but we hope convincing ( cf .",
    "@xcite for an example of a proper historical investigation ) .",
    "first , let us discard two popular theories : that the name was introduced by netto in  @xcite or by bell in  @xcite .",
    "upon careful study of the text , it is clear that netto did single out catalan s work and in general was not particularly careful with the references , but never specifically mentioned `` catalan zahlen '' .",
    "similarly , eric temple bell ( 18831960 ) was a well known mathematical historian , and referred to `` catalan s numbers '' only in the context of catalan s work . in a footnote , he in fact referred to them as the `` euler  segner sequence '' and clarifies the history of the problem .",
    "our investigation shows that the credit for naming catalan numbers is due to an american combinatorialist john riordan ( 19031988 ) .",
    "he tried this three times . the first two : _ math reviews _",
    "mr0024411 ( 1948 ) and mr0164902 ( 1964 ) went unnoticed . even marshall hall s influential  1967 monograph  @xcite",
    "does not have the name .",
    "but in 1968 , when riordan used `` catalan numbers '' in the monograph  @xcite , he clearly struck a chord .    although riordan s book is now viewed as somewhat disorganized and unnecessarily simplistic , back in the day it was quite popular .",
    "it was lauded as `` excellent and stimulating '' in p.r .",
    "stein s review , which continued to say `` combinatorial identities is , in fact , a book that must be read , from cover to cover , and several times . ''",
    "we are guessing it had a great influence on the field and cemented the terminology and some notation .",
    "we have further evidence of riordan s authorship of a different nature : the _ ngram chart _ for the words `` catalan numbers '' , which searches google books content for this sentence over the years .",
    "the search clearly shows that the name spread after  1968 and that riordan s monograph was the first book which contained it .",
    "there were three more events on the way to the wide adoption of the name `` catalan numbers '' . in 1971 ,",
    "henry gould used it in the early version of  @xcite , a bibliography of catalan numbers with 243 entries .",
    "then , in 1973 , neil  sloane gave this name to the sequence entry in  @xcite , with riordan s monograph and gould s bibliography being two of the only five references .",
