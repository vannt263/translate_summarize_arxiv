    "frictional interfaces are abundant in biological ( e.g. adherent cells and cell locomotion ) , engineering ( e.g. micro - electro - mechanical devices ) and geophysical ( e.g. earthquake faults ) systems around us , and are of fundamental and practical importance .",
    "consequently , understanding the dynamics of dry frictional interfaces has been the focus of intense scientific activity in the last few decades @xcite .",
    "it has been established that under steady - state sliding conditions , the frictional resistance features a non - trivial velocity dependence , and that this dependence has dramatic consequences on the dynamic response of frictional interfaces @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that for a broad range of materials friction is velocity - weakening  that is , the steady frictional resistance is a decreasing function of the sliding velocity  at least in the regime of low velocities , up to a few hundreds of microns per second .",
    "this feature favors various instabilities and stick - slip motion @xcite .",
    "a very recent compilation of a large set of experimental data for a broad range of materials , however , has revealed that for higher slip velocities , friction generically becomes velocity - strengthening over some range of slip velocities @xcite .",
    "the existence of velocity - strengthening behavior might have significant effects on various aspects of frictional dynamics .",
    "in particular , recent laboratory experiments on fault - zone materials have documented slow slip interfacial events  an intensely debated issue  and have linked it to a crossover in the frictional response , from velocity - weakening to velocity - strengthening friction , with increasing slip velocity @xcite .",
    "while the possible implications of the existence of velocity - strengthening friction have been rather sporadically discussed in the literature @xcite , to the best of our knowledge a comprehensive and systematic theoretical exploration of these important issues is currently missing .    as a first step in closing this gap , we study here the effect of velocity - strengthening friction on spatiotemporal interfacial dynamics , energy dissipation and radiation , and the global interfacial strength , with a special focus on the nucleation , propagation and arrest of rupture fronts .",
    "we explore three variants of a realistic rate - and - state friction law , one which is purely velocity - weakening , one which crosses over at higher velocities to logarithmic velocity - strengthening friction , and one which crosses over to linear velocity - strengthening friction .",
    "we show that the presence or absence of velocity - strengthening friction at relatively high slip velocities can significantly affect the global interfacial resistance ( strength ) and the energy released during frictional instabilities ( `` event magnitude '' ) , even under quasi - static loading conditions .",
    "different forms of velocity - strengthening friction , in our case logarithmic and linear , give rise to events of similar magnitude , yet with dramatically different dissipation and radiation rates .",
    "the difference stems from the broad range of the underlying rupture propagation velocities , where stronger velocity - strengthening friction promotes slower rupture , possibly orders of magnitude slower than elastic wave - speeds .",
    "this result is directly related to the recent experimental observations of @xcite .",
    "all in all , our results show that velocity - strengthening friction should be properly quantified and incorporated into friction theory as it appears to affect many basic properties of spatially extended frictional interfaces .",
    "the ideas to be presented below have been originally influenced by the works in @xcite and then further developed in @xcite .",
    "the rate - and - state friction model we study has been introduced recently in @xcite , and is reviewed here briefly .",
    "we start by considering a multi - contact interface and write the ratio @xmath0 of the real contact area ( the area of all contact asperities ) to the nominal one , in terms of a state parameter @xmath1 ( of time dimensions ) as @xmath2 \\",

    "@xmath1 is usually interpreted as the interface s effective age , and its evolution is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the local interfacial slip velocity and @xmath10 is a lengthscale related to the contact asperities geometry .",
    "@xmath11 , with an extremely small @xmath12nm / s , is a regularization function that plays no important role , and is actually omitted in all of the analytic results that follow . as we focus here on unidirectional motion , we do not distinguish between @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "the frictional stress @xmath14 is written as a sum of an elastic contribution , @xmath15 , and a viscous contribution @xmath16 , @xmath17 the viscous contribution takes the form @xmath18 , where at least at low velocities , the rheological part @xmath19 corresponds to a stress - biased thermally - activated process @xcite @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath22 is the absolute temperature , @xmath23 is an activation volume and @xmath24 is a velocity scale , related to a microscopic attempt rate .",
    "a higher velocity variant of eq . ( [ eq : tauvis ] ) will be discussed below .",
    "the elastic stress follows the evolution equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the interfacial shear modulus and @xmath27 is the effective height of the interface .",
    "equations - describe the first variant of the friction model we study below .",
    "we begin by describing its behavior under steady sliding at a velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the steady solution of eq .",
    "is @xmath29 , from which it follows that the contact area is a logarithmically decreasing function of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the fixed point of eq .",
    "reads @xmath30 , and hence the overall frictional resistance is given by @xmath31 where a higher order logarithmic term was omitted and the following definitions were used @xmath32 in the low velocity regime , i.e. @xmath33 , @xmath34 is a logarithmic function of @xmath9 , with @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath36 ( which is quite generically the case ) , friction is logarithmic velocity - weakening .    physically , friction is velocity - weakening because the real contact area is a decreasing function of the sliding velocity , and its velocity dependence is stronger than the rheological dependence of @xmath16 .",

    "it is seen that the friction force increases gradually until it experiences an abrupt drop , followed by repeated cycles of gradual increases and abrupt drops , typical of frictional systems @xcite .",
    "the drops in the friction force , which appear as vertical lines in this figure , occur when sliding becomes unstable , and involve nucleation and propagation of rupture fronts , as will be discussed below .    before the first drop , the friction force corresponding to the three variants is identical , as can be expected because the dynamics in this regime are slow and governed by the loading velocity @xmath28 . in this range of velocities ,",
    "the three variants coincide and consequently the first drop occurs almost exactly at the same point in time for all of the variants , suggesting that the instability mechanism is insensitive to the high velocity behavior ( as predicted in @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : fd ] by @xmath78 .",

    "[ fig : fd ] that the differences between the three variants persist to _ any _ event .",

    "[ fig : fd ] .    figure [ fig : fronts ] shows the propagation and arrest of rupture fronts during the first event .",
    "first , we note the vast difference in the timescales involved : while rupture fronts in the ls and pw models arrest after a few 10@xmath80s , in the stl model they last for a few ms .",
    "it is observed , however , that while the penetration depth of the front into the interface in the ls and stl models is comparable , for the pw model it is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "furthermore , the rupture propagation velocity in the ls model is an order of magnitude smaller than in the pw model ( the latter is of the order of the elastic wave - speed ) , and the propagation velocity in the stl model is yet two orders of magnitude smaller .    both the ls and stl models give rise to rupture fronts that are much slower than the elastic wave - speed .",
    "these remarkably low rupture propagation velocities , three orders of magnitude slower than the elastic wave - speed in the stl model , might be related to the important , and rather intensely debated , issue of slow rupture @xcite .",
    "our calculations suggest that the emergence of slow rupture might be directly related to the existence and form of velocity - strengthening friction .",
    "this is in accord with recent laboratory experiments on fault - zone materials , which documented slow slip events together with a clear crossover from velocity - weakening to velocity - strengthening friction with increasing slip velocity @xcite .    .",
    "it is seen that the stress left at the tail of the rupture fronts , @xmath81 , is roughly homogeneous in space , and that it is much lower in the pw model than in the ls and stl models . the location of the fronts after the event is marked by @xmath82 .",
    "the deeper penetration of the pw model , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fronts ] , is clearly visible . ]    a lot can be learned from the state of the interface after the rupture front has passed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : before_after ] we plot the spatial distribution of the ( normalized ) friction stress just before the first rupture event and immediately after it for the three variant models . in both of these states , the higher slip rates associated with the rupture fronts are not present ( before the event they have not yet been generated and after the event they have died off ) , and the mechanical state is quasi - static . in line with the previous results , prior to the inception of the first event the stress profiles in the three models essentially coincide .",
    "when the fronts propagate and eventually arrest , they leave behind them a residual stress profile , which is much smaller in the pw model compared to the ls and stl models .",
    "this residual stress is approximately homogeneous in space and is lower than the stress prior to the event .",
    "the elastic energy release during this stress relaxation process is the driving force to frictional dissipation .",
    "the approximate spatial homogeneity of @xmath14 left behind _ any _ rupture front when it arrests , allows us to estimate the loading force @xmath83 at the discrete arrest times @xmath84 ( that is , there is @xmath76 corresponding to each rupture event ) .",
    "for that aim , we neglect the contribution to the integral in the region @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the location of the peak of @xmath14 slightly after a rupture front arrested ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : before_after ] ) , and then assume that @xmath87 can be replaced by a constant residual stress @xmath81 , obtaining @xmath88    to calculate @xmath86 , we note that at the arrest times @xmath76 eq . takes the form @xmath89 ( i.e. in the range @xmath90 and neglecting inertia ) . with the approximate boundary conditions",
    "@xmath91 , this equation can be readily solved as @xmath92 this can be substituted in eq . to give @xmath93 where @xmath94 was used ( which is , of course , valid at any time , not only at the discrete arrest times @xmath95 ) .    the prediction in eq . ,",
    "i.e. @xmath96 , is tested in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] for all three models over many events ( i.e. this is a multiple - event property , not only a property of the first event , which was the focus of the discussion up to now ) .",
    "the analytic prediction is observed to be in favorable agreement with the numerical data for all three models , where the prefactor ( slope ) in the relation @xmath96 is the same for the ls and stl models , but is significantly smaller for the pw model .",
    "these results show that @xmath81 is the same for every rupture event and lend direct support to the assumption that spatial variations of the residual stress left behind _ any _ rupture front can be neglected , consistent with the explicit stress profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : before_after ] ( for the first event in the three different models ) .",
    "the latter observation allows us to extract @xmath81 , the only unknown quantity in eq .",
    "( all other quantities are known parameters , which are the same for all three models ) , yielding @xmath97 for the ls and stl models and @xmath98 for the pw model .",
    "the fact that the models that feature a nonmonotonic velocity dependence , i.e. the ls and stl models , give rise to an essentially identical residual stress @xmath81 is intimately related to the value of the steady state stress at the minimum of the friction curve ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ss ] ) , which is the same for both .",
    "equation then shows that the fact that the pw model produces a lower overall frictional resistance ( and deeper force drops ) compared to the ls and stl models is intimately related to the fact that the residual stress left behind the rupture fronts in the pw model is significantly lower than that of the ls and stl models .",
    "furthermore , eq . suggests an explanation for why the penetration depth , i.e. @xmath86 , is significantly larger in the pw model than in the other two models .",
    "the `` static friction coefficient '' @xmath99 is ordinarily defined as the tangential force , normalized by the normal force , needed to initiate global motion of the block .",
    "this force also corresponds to the peak of the loading curve . from this perspective ,",
    "all of the spatiotemporal dynamics discussed up to now are precursory @xcite , as they precede global motion which sets in only when a rupture front reaches the leading edge of the block ( i.e. when @xmath100 ) .",
    "hence , we can estimate @xmath99 , which quantifies the global frictional resistance , as @xmath101 where eq . was used .",
    "this shows that the `` static '' frictional resistance of the interface , measured at slow loading velocities ( here @xmath48 m/s ) , is influenced by dynamic processes at much higher slip rates and furthermore that the existence of velocity - strengthening friction behavior strongly affects @xmath99 through @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the results discussed above highlight two important points .",
    "first , an effectively constant residual stress @xmath81 is left behind rupture fronts in all of the models studied here .",
    "this property emerges spontaneously , unlike conventional slip - weakening models in which it is assumed a priori ( see , for example , @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath81 depends on the existence of velocity - strengthening friction , which in turn has significant implications on the strength of the interface , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] and eq . .",
    "note also that the constancy of the residual stress @xmath81 implies that the mechanical fields associated with frictional shear cracks in 2d are well described by the classical theory of fracture @xcite .",
    "second , once @xmath81 is known , the arrest of rupture fronts is determined by global equilibrium conditions @xcite , rather than by dynamic considerations ( cf .",
    "as energy dissipation is at the heart of frictional phenomena , it will be interesting and instructive to consider the energy budget in the system .",
    "as a starting point , we briefly remind the reader that the linear momentum conservation law of eq .",
    "( [ eq : momentum ] ) can be transformed into a continuity equation for the energy density ( using hooke s law and integration by parts ) .",
    "the result reads @xmath102 the first term is the rate of variation of the energy density ( both kinetic and elastic ) , and the second term is the divergence of the energy flux vector .",

    "the time integral of @xmath123 over the event duration is the total energy released , which is a natural measure of the magnitude of the event ( other measures exist as well ) .",

    "this result clearly demonstrates that depending on the form of the velocity - strengthening friction branch ( e.g. logarithmic vs. linear ) one can observe events of the same magnitude ( i.e. integrated dissipation / energy release ) accompanied by very different dissipation rates ( see table [ tab : dissipation ] ) .",
    "this result might be related to geophysical observations indicating that slow rupture does not necessarily imply smaller integrated slip and energy release ( * ? ? ?",
    "* especially figure 5 ) .",
    "the total dissipation in the pw model is about @xmath132 times larger than the total dissipation in the ls and stl models , consistent with the much larger stress drops and the significantly reduced interfacial resistance observed in fig .",

    "in conclusion , by studying the spatiotemporal dynamics in three variants of a realistic rate - and - state friction model under quasi - static side - loading conditions , we showed that the existence and form of velocity - strengthening friction may significantly affect various aspects of the frictional response of interfaces .",

    "it is also shown that events of similar magnitude ( and hence stress drops ) can be accompanied by substantially different dissipation and kinetic energy radiation rates .    our theoretical results , together with extensive experimental evidence @xcite ,",
    "highlight the need to quantitatively characterize the velocity - strengthening frictional response of interfaces , both experimentally and theoretically , and to systematically incorporate it into friction theory . since frictional instabilities spontaneously lead to accelerated slip that probes relatively high - velocity properties of frictional interfaces , the latter  which include velocity - strengthening friction ",
    "affect the frictional response even under quasi - static loading conditions .",
    "this understanding may offer new ways to interpret existing observations in a broad range of frictional systems and to develop predictive theories of the dynamics of spatially extended frictional interfaces ."

    "<S> we elucidate the importance of velocity - strengthening friction by theoretically studying three variants of a realistic rate - and - state friction model . </S>",
    "<S> all variants feature identical logarithmic velocity - weakening friction at small sliding velocities , but differ in their higher velocity behaviors . by quantifying energy partition ( e.g. radiation and dissipation ) , the selection of interfacial rupture fronts and rupture arrest , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence or absence of velocity - strengthening friction can significantly affect the global interfacial resistance and the total energy released during frictional instabilities ( `` event magnitude '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that different forms of velocity - strengthening friction ( e.g. logarithmic vs. linear ) may result in events of similar magnitude , yet with dramatically different dissipation and radiation rates . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because the events are mediated by interfacial rupture fronts with vastly different propagation velocities , where stronger velocity - strengthening friction promotes slower rupture . </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical results may have significant implications on our understanding of frictional dynamics . </S>"
