    "low mass stars ( lms ) constitute @xmath080% of our stellar neighbourhood .",
    "they provide a probe of our understanding of main sequence stellar evolution and are key in determining the boundary between stellar and sub stellar objects",
    ". however , their spectra are extremely rich in structure and their opacity is made up of many molecular and atomic absorbers , each with hundred of thousands to millions of spectral lines .",
    "this means that colours are not easily interpretable as diagnostic of their properties . among the fundamental properties of lms , of particular importance",
    "is their effective temperature , t@xmath1 : the latter has frequently been investigated but it is still not well determined .",
    "in particular there is not yet a tight correlation between spectral type and effective temperature as there has been a long standing discrepancy between empirical effective temperatures and those derived by synthetic spectra ( @xmath0 125  k as estimated by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "this is primarily due to the lack of a complete inclusion of molecular and atomic opacities in the models , in particular in the near infrared ( nir ) . modelling",
    "the atmosphere of lms in the nir is not a trivial task : water vapour dominates this part of the spectrum and at the effective temperature applicable to cool star atmospheres ( @xmath24000 k ) water can access energies as high as 45000 @xmath3 before it dissociates ; to reproduce high temperature water spectra is very challenging because of the complexity of the vibrational and rotational motion of asymmetric triatomic molecules .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) used a synthetic grid which includes the water linelist calculated by partridge & schwenke ( 1997 ) to determine fundamental parameters for a large sample of lms .",
    "they conclude that problems remain with the match of the observed water bands .",
    "allard et al . ( 2000 ) also find that the models including this water linelist reproduce well late - type dwarfs but fail to reproduce hotter dwarfs .",
    "the main sources of error in present water opacity databases are the incorrect high temperature transitions ( jones et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "recently a new water linelist , bt2 , has been produced ( barber et al .",
    "the bt2 linelist is by far the most complete linelist available , reaching higher energies than previously published . a comparison between a previous release of the bt2 linelist ( bt1 ) and the ps linelist showed that at higher temperatures ( t @xmath4 2000k ) the ps linelist is missing around 25 per cent of the water vapour opacity ( jones et al . 2005 ) .",
    "while the bt2 increases the accuracy of the fitting in the nir region , its cut off at energies above 30000 @xmath3 still means that none of the energy levels above 20000 @xmath3 are capable of being excited by 1 @xmath5 m photons ( barber et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "although the strongest water vapour opacity is at shorter wavelengths , analysis of sunspots ( wallace et al . 1995 ) shows that h@xmath6o also accounts for the majority of lines in the mid infrared ( mir ) region between 8 and 21 @xmath5 m .",
    "polyansky et al ( 1997a , b ) successfully assigned many of the water transitions in the 10 - 13 micron spectra of sunspots with further recent assignments being made in conjunction with the analysis of oxy - acetylene emission spectra ( coheur et al .",
    "2005 ; zobov et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this spectral region",
    "the water transitions are largely pure rotational , in contrast to the vibration - rotation transitions which dominate at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the use of pure rotational transitions greatly simplifies the spectral analysis as estimates of the transition strengths are much more straightforward . to a good approximation",
    "the strength of individual rotational transitions can be estimated from a simple algebraic formula times a boltzmann factor .",
    "furthermore , the presence of pure rotational transitions within different vibrational states , which is characteristic of the sunspot spectrum , yields a large dynamic range for temperature analysis .",
    "these advantages potentially make the mir region ideal for the determination of the effective temperature scale for lms .    here",
    "we propose a new methodology for establishing the effective temperatures of cool stars , in particular lms , based on high resolution mir spectroscopy .",
    "taking advantage of the relatively easy to interpret mir spectrum in cool stars has been done before : ryde et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used high resolution observations of water vapour in super - giants to show that classical photosphere models can not fit the observed spectra and that synthetic spectra based on cooler photospheric temperature structure are needed .",
    "this supports the idea that individual rotational water lines are highly sensitive to temperature variations in this region . in this paper",
    "we present the _ first _ high resolution ( 90,000 ) mir observational data for two m dwarfs , together with one m giant .",
    "our observations are described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we present the data , the identification of the water lines and a theoretical sensitivity study using the bt2 linelist . in section 4",
    "we briefly conclude .",
    "the data were taken in november 2006 using the texas echelon - cross - echelle spectrograph ( texes , lacy et al .",
    "2002 ) at the gemini north 8 m telescope .",
    "the observations were made on the nights of nov 20 , 23 , and 27 for a total of @xmath013 hours .",
    "we observed three objects ( bs587 , gj411 and gj273 - see table 1 ) in the texes high spectral resolution mode in two grating positions : 11.2 and 12.5 @xmath5 m ( 800 and 892.857 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the two grating positions were chosen on the basis of a relative lack of narrow telluric features and abundance of temperature sensitive water features based on an early version of our ab initio water line list , as well as of a careful analysis of the sunspot ( t@xmath03300k ) 10 - 13 @xmath5 m spectrum .",
    "the spectral coverage was 0.5%  at 11.2 @xmath5 m and 0.75%  at 12.5 @xmath5 m . at 12.5 @xmath5 m",
    ", there are slight gaps in the spectral coverage because the angular width of the spectral orders is larger than the detector .",
    "the spectral resolution , as determined by gaussian fits to telluric atmospheric lines in the 12.5 @xmath5 m setting , has a fwhm equivalent to r=90,000 .",
    "we expect the same spectral resolution at 11.2 @xmath5 m .",
    "the slit width was 0.5@xmath7 for all observations and the length was roughly 4@xmath7 and 2.5@xmath7 at 11.2 @xmath5 m and 12.5 @xmath5 m , respectively .",
    "for all observations , we nodded the source along the slit roughly every 10 seconds .    of our targets , gj411 and bs587",
    "were sufficiently bright to fine tune pointing based on the signal recorded from every nod pair .",
    "gj273 was weaker and required accumulation of several nod pairs to evaluate pointing adjustments with confidence . on nov 23 , clouds were occasionally present based on elevated background signal through texes .",
    "we discarded the data that were most severely effected .",
    "coordinates and properties of the three objects are listed in table 1 .",
    "the two dwarfs were chosen among a sample of well studied dwarfs : note that for both gj411 and gj273 , the quoted temperatures have an uncertainties of at least 100k ( cf kirkpatrick et al 1993 and tsuji et al .",
    "the quoted radial velocities are from the literature ( marcy et al .",
    "1987 ) and they match the sunspot features within 0.5 km / s .",
    "the data were reduced according to standard procedures as described in lacy et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the texes pipeline provides for differencing of individual nod pairs , correcting spikes and cosmic rays , establishing a wavelength scale based on a user - identified telluric line , correcting distortions in the instrument , extracting 1d spectra using optimal weighting along the slit length , and combining spectra from the same night weighted by the square of their signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the pipeline also performs flat - fielding and a first order correction for telluric spectral features using the difference between an ambient temperature blackbody and sky emission .",
    "further flat - field and telluric correction comes from division by a featureless point source such as an asteroid or hot star .",
    "data from separate nights were aligned spectrally and combined according to the square of their signal - to - noise ratio using custom idl procedures .",
    "the dispersion calculations are accurate to 0.6 km / s or better .",

    "figures 1 and 2 show the recorded spectra for our sample for the two wavelength regions .",
    "the gaps in the spectra coincide with the removals of bad pixels and of telluric lines .",
    "the signal to noise varies from star to star ( @xmath0 100 for bs587 , 40 for gj411 and 5 for gj273 ) .",
    "we used the bright star bs587 as a template for the identification of the water lines in the spectra due to its high s / n . in total",
    "we identified 71 lines in the observed spectra which could potentially be water ( see table 2 ) ; however , only 52 of them are confirmed by comparison with the bt2 linelist ( see table 2 and figures 3 and 4 ) , some of these ( 24 , 25 , 29 , 38 , 44 , 53 , 62 and 66 in table 2 ) are weak according to theory",
    ". note that in order for a feature to be confirmed and assigned as water we required its intensity to be @xmath4 10@xmath12 cm / molecule and its frequency to be within 0.001 @xmath3 .",
    "40 of the 52 lines have been independently identified and assigned in the sunspot spectra ( zobov et al .",
    "2006 ) . of the 19 remaining lines not identified in bt2 , 13 are also present in the sunspot spectra ( wallace et al . 1995 ) and 4 of these 13 have been in fact assigned to water ( zobov et al .",
    "2006 and private communications ) .",
    "many of the observed features are blends of multiple lines ( often 2 , the para : ortho pair lines ) : for these cases we assigned the band to the strongest component ( ortho in the case of pairs of lines ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show examples of our line assignment with the observed stellar spectrum on the top panel overplotted to the sunspot spectrum ( offset from the bs587 spectrum by + 0.05 ) , and with a synthetic water linelist computed at 3500 k on the bottom panel .",
    "note that the choice of temperature for the synthetic water spectrum is @xmath13 a best fit but was chosen to represent a bright cool stellar atmosphere and is close to that of the sunspot spectrum .",
    "in fact , a synthetic spectrum at 3000k may be more representative of a 3500k giant since the gas temperatures of the layers where most flux is emitted are typically 500k less than the effective temperature of the star ( allard et al .",
    "1997 ) . we have compared a 3000k synthetic water linelist with bs587 and find that the same number of water lines are identified .",
    "some of the lines identified as water transitions in the observed spectra are not from experimentally - known levels . for some of these cases the quantum numbers have not been fully determined and those given in table 2 are the rigorous ones only from the ab initio data .",
    "we have singled out these transitions in italic in table 2 .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that some of the identified lines are in fact ro - vibrational : we have excluded these transitions from our sensitivity analysis ( see next section and table 3 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
