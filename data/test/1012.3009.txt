    "discoveries of empirical correlations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) raised many researches on early universe using grbs .",
    "one of the most well studied correlations is the one between the spectral peak energy ( @xmath0 ) and isotropic equivalent energy ( ) called correlation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar but tighter correlation between @xmath0 and 1-second peak luminosity called the correlation .",
    "these correlations are tight but they have large dispersions such as @xmath7 in @xmath2 and @xmath8 in @xmath9which can not be explained as statistical errors of @xmath0 , and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath0 tightly correlates with the collimation - corrected gamma - ray energy ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that adding the high signal time scale ( @xmath11 ) to the relation reduces the dispersion of the correlation .",
    "this correlation is defined by using only prompt emission properties like , correlations so that it seems to be promising tools to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , this correlation is not confirmed by later studies @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that the luminosity time ( @xmath12 ) also improves both the and correlations .",
    "these correlations were used to investigate the star formation history @xcite , the reionaization epoch @xcite , and the cosmological expansion history of the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of high correlation coefficients , there have been many cautions to use these empirical correlations for cosmology @xcite . to establish these correlations in grbs prompt emissions as tools to determine cosmological parameters",
    ", we must investigate the origins of systematic errors and the way to remove them .",
    "we note that there are many factors to cause systematic errors besides intrinsic dispersions of their prompt emissions . for example",
    "the sensitivity of the detectors , the evolution effects of grbs , the confusion with other sources , the lack of unknown parameters like the jet opening angle @xmath13 , etc .",
    "all of these effects might arise the additional systematic errors over the intrinsic dispersions of grbs .",
    "possible selection effects on these correlations are studied by many authors with contrasting results @xcite .",
    "however previous studies did not consider the difference of spectral models to determine @xmath14 well .",
    "as shown in @xcite , it often happens that high energy power - law index @xmath15 for the band model with four free parameters can not be determined by the data so that the cutoff power - law ( cpl ) model with three free parameters is used to fit the data .",
    "cpl model might be good if the peak energy is close to the high energy end of the detector band width .",
    "one can not use band model but cpl model if the event is so dim that the number of high energy photons is very small .",
    "importantly , simulations in @xcite showed that , if the signal - to - noise ratio is relatively low , a true spectrum with the shape of the band model can be fitted by cpl model with @xmath16 which is larger than the true value of @xmath16 up to @xmath17",
    ". therefore cpl model might overestimate @xmath0 . while , if we fit a true cpl spectrum by the band model , the estimated value of @xmath18 is almost equal to the true value since the large value of @xmath19 looks like an exponential function . in reality",
    "@xcite found that @xmath14 estimated using the cpl model by @xcite are systematically harder than @xmath14 estimated using the band model by @xcite .",
    "although the systematic difference between the peak energies fitted by the band model and the ones fitted by the cpl model are reported , how this difference affect the spectral - brightness correlations of grbs has been hardly studied so that we shall study this problem in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate the effect of uncertainty in using different spectral models which determine @xmath0 on the , and correlations , using our database developed in @xcite .",
    "we examine this model bias by dividing the samples into two data sets as gold and bronze according to the quality of spectral observation . in this paper , we assume , if signal - to - noise ratio is high enough , all of the spectrum of grbs are well expressed by the band function ,    the structure of this letter is as follows .",
    "first we describe our database of 109 grbs with known redshift and well - determined spectral parameters , 1-second peak luminosity , and isotropic energy in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we construct the , , and correlations with only gold data set in section  [ sec : correlations ] .",
    "finally we will give summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in @xcite , we constructed a database selecting 109 grbs from gcn circular archive @xcite and grblog @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly describe our database .",
    "let us begin with @xmath0 .",
    "in many cases , the prompt gamma - ray spectrum is well fitted with the spectral model of the exponentially - connected broken power - law function suggested by @xcite .",
    "this band function has four parameters , the low - energy photon index @xmath20 , the high - energy photon index @xmath15 , the spectral break energy @xmath21 and the normalization @xmath22 .",
    "the peak energy ( @xmath14 ) , at which the flux is maximum in the @xmath23 spectrum , can be calculated as @xmath24 .",
    "however , for some grbs , the photon index ( mostly @xmath15 ) can not be determined due to the limited energy range of the detector and/or the lack of the number photons @xcite .",
    "when the observation of high - energy range is not enough , the spectrum is sometimes fitted with the cut - off power law ( cpl ) function .",
    "this function has three parameters , the low - energy photon index @xmath20 , the spectral break energy @xmath21 and the normalization @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the peak energy can be derived as @xmath24 . note that even if , for a given grb spectrum , the reduced chi square value of this model is smaller than that of the band function , it is difficult to say whether this model reflects the intrinsic property of the grb or it is just due to the poor statistics in the high - energy range .",
    "the reported values of @xmath0 for grbs which were poorly observed in the high - energy range are based on either the band function or cpl function , depending on the observation team so that there exists the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath0 from the biginning .",
    "let us move on to @xmath25 , @xmath1 and @xmath26 . in @xcite , we calculated the bolometric energy and the peak luminosity in the energy range 1 - 10,000  kev in the rest frame of each grb by extending the observed spectrum . here , it should be noted that the integration was performed assuming the band function even for grbs whose spectra were not fitted by the band function and the photon indices were not reported . in these cases",
    "we assumed the typical values @xmath27 and @xmath28 to calculate the bolometric fluence ( @xmath29 ) and the bolometric peak flux @xmath30 .",
    "these values are suggested by batse observations @xcite and also supported by fermi observations of grb  080916c , 081024b , 090323 and 090428 up to possibly 100  gev energy range .",
    "then the bolometric isotropic energy ( @xmath25 ) and the 1-second peak luminosity ( @xmath1 ) can be simply calculated as @xmath31 and @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the luminosity distance calculated for the flat universe with the cosmological parameters of @xmath34 and the hubble parameter of @xmath35 .",
    "further we define the luminosity time as the third parameter of grb prompt emission as @xmath36 the error of the luminosity time is estimated by using error propagation equation .",
    "we can neglect the crossterm between @xmath1 and @xmath25 because of the independence of the and relation shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , for grb whose observed photon number is small , there are two possible systematic effects .",
    "one comes from the fact that the peak energy @xmath0 is determined by fitting the spectrum with either the band function or cpl function . as @xcite pointed out that the cpl function tends to overestimate @xmath0 compared to the band function",
    "this would induce a systematic error in the correlations related to @xmath0 . on the other hand , although @xmath1 and @xmath25 are determined in a single straightforward way , the photon indices are set to the typical values if the number of detected photons is small .",
    "this would also cause a systematic error .    to estimate these systematic errors , we call a certain grb belongs to the gold data set if its spectrum is well observed so that it is fitted by the band function quite well and all four parameters are accurately determined .",
    "other grbs for which the fixed @xmath20 and/or @xmath15 are allocated to bronze data set . here",
    "3 of 109 grbs in the database of @xcite , do not have @xmath25 and then @xmath26 so they are included in neither the gold nor the bronze data sets . as a result , the number of the gold and bronze data sets are 41 and 65 grbs , respectively .    in the following sections , we construct the , and relations for the gold data set .",
    "it is expected that the correlations obtained from the gold data set would suffer from relatively small systematic errors so that we could study real intrinsic dispersions of the correlations .",
    "here we derive the , , and correlations from the gold data set .",
    "first we assume the correlation among @xmath0 , @xmath26 and @xmath1 to be of the form , @xmath37 , where we take the denominator of the second and third terms as the average value of @xmath0 and @xmath26 in gold data set to minimize the statistical errors for these correlations . for this correlation , we found seven outliers ( 980425 , 980613 , 000131 , 090328 , 091003 , 091020 , 091127 ) shown by blue color in top left of fig.1 .",
    "the seven outliers deviate from the best - fit relation at more than 3-@xmath38 dispersion level .",
    "we will give some arguments on this point in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "using 34 gold data set of grbs , we calculate the best fit function shown by the solid black line in top left of fig . 1 with red points of the gold data set and 3 @xmath38 errors of the relation by the yellow color region",
    ". the functional form of the best fit function is given by @xmath39 here , we include not only errors in @xmath1 but also errors in @xmath0 and @xmath26 so that the chi - square function is defined as @xmath40 where the first term of weighting factor is @xmath41 .",
    "the factor 2c in front of @xmath42 comes from the fact that the definition of @xmath26 includes @xmath1 .",
    "the reduced chi - square is unity with the intrinsic dispersion @xmath43 .",
    "this correlation is consistent with our previous study @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the best - fit function and errors of the ( top right of fig.1 ) and ( bottom of fig.1 ) correlations for the same 34 gold grbs , @xmath44 with the intrinsic dispersion @xmath45 , and @xmath46 with the intrinsic dispersion @xmath47 .",
    "the best fit values of the and correlations are consistent with previous studies but the intrinsic dispersions are tighter than those in @xcite in which both gold and bronze data are used .",
    "the values of @xmath48 suggest that correlation is tightest among three correlations . in fig . 1 , we show the gold data set ( red points ) with the best - fit function ( solid line ) and 3-sigma dispersion region ( dotted lines ) .",
    "we see that the correlation is much tighter than the and correlations by eye also .",
    "the blue points and green points indicate seven outliers of the correlation and bronze data set , respectively .",
    "the bronze data set are systematically harder and/or dimmer than the gold data set .",
    "this difference causes a large dispersion in addition to the intrinsic dispersion of the correlations if we include the bronze data in the analysis .",
    "in this paper , using database constructed by @xcite , we examine the model bias , that is , band or cpl , on , and correlations . we found that grbs with the peak energies fitted by the cpl model are distributed in systematically harder and/or dimmer side of the , and correlations than the ones by the band function .",
    "there might be two interpretations about this result .",
    "the first is that these correlations have much larger intrinsic dispersion than that of observed one .",
    "if we had the more sensitive detector and could observe dimmer grbs , the dispersion of the relations would become larger@xcite .",
    "another is that the use of the cpl model to estimate the peak energies causes this systematic difference . as simulated by @xcite , the band function spectrum",
    "is well fitted by the cpl model if the detector does not have enough sensitivity to observe the high - energy photons .",
    "however the peak energies fitted by the cpl models are always higher than that of the simulated band function spectrum ( see table .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it seems to be natural to conclude that the latter is more acceptable . in short , using only the peak energies determined by the band function , we would get tighter correlations . if we could have much more grbs by which we can uniformly analyze the data with the band function , grbs would be more powerful tool to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "we found seven outliers in our gold data set .",
    "we classify these outliers in two classes as    1 .",
    "( dimmer and/or harder ) 980425 , 980613 , 090328 , 091003 2 .",
    "( brighter and/or softer ) 000131 , 091020 , 091127    although we do not know how and why these outliers are different from ordinary grbs except for the distribution in the space , the effect of eliminating these grbs is obvious , that is , the correlation becomes tighter . to find the characteristics which distinguish these outliers from ordinary grbs is urgent .",
    "we here point out possible origins of these outliers .",
    "let us assume that if we observe the jet nearly on axis , correlation would be very tight .",
    "however if we observe the jet with a certain viewing angle , we might have some dispersions on the observed correlation .",
    "in other words , we might not avoid some dispersion in the correlation from viewing angle , especially when the observer locates near the edge of the jet of grbs .",
    "if we will know how to distinguish these outliers from the ordinary gold grbs , the correlation might be much tighter and very useful in determining the nature of dark energy in redshift larger than @xmath493 .",
    "we should note that even in the period - luminosity relation of cepheid variable there are @xmath49 10% outliers @xcite so it is not surprising that there are @xmath49 20% outliers in the relation .",
    "@xcite , using the bayesian approach to estimate @xmath0 , indicated that dim events close to the detector sensitivity would make large scatter on the @xmath0@xmath25 and @xmath0@xmath1 relations and that there is a significant threshold effect .",
    "thus , they conclude that the correlation have larger intrinsic dispersion than observed if we do not suffer from a threshold effect .",
    "recently , @xcite argue that using hardness ratio instead of @xmath14 they also find that @xmath18-fluence correlation become more wider if we will be able to determine @xmath14 of dimmer events .",
    "however , there is a possible bias by using different method to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "even the difference of @xmath14 between the band and cpl models causes the systematic errors so that using the other method to estimate @xmath14 might cause the additional systematic errors .",
    "the smaller the intrinsic dispersion of the relation is , the more the correlation suffers from these systematic effects .",
    "this might be why the @xmath14@xmath11@xmath50 relation is not confirmed by later studies @xcite .",
    "kaneko et al . ( 2006 ) suggested the @xmath14 value of cpl function becomes systematically higher than the one of the band function . if the 65 bronze data previously analyzed by the cpl function are reconsidered by the band function with the fixed @xmath15 as an average value of @xmath51 ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ) , they might show the distribution around the best fit line of each correlation estimated with 41 gold data set .",
    "they have a good potential to become a `` silver '' data set .",
    "to do so , we need help from each instrument team , and this is a future work .",
    "finally , we note that there would be many reasons which cause systematic errors on the correlation in addition to intrinsic property of grbs .",
    "these systematic errors must be carefully estimated and removed from the correlation analysis one by one .",
    "if we will finish it , grbs become more powerful and unique standard candles to investigate the nature of the dark energy at high redshift larger than @xmath49 3 .",
