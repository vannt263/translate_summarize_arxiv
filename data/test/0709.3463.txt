    "by a ratchet effect one usually refers to the existence of directed transport in a system in which there is no net bias force .",
    "ratchets have been traditionally found in the study of dissipative systems @xcite , where external fluctuations causing brownian motion cooperate with a periodic force to bias transport , a mechanism that is in the basis of some biological motors @xcite .",
    "ratchets can also appear without dissipation .",
    "these hamiltonian or conservative ratchets are interesting as they can be extended to quantum mechanical systems . in this context",
    "one finds studies that relate the existence of transport to classical properties of the model , such as some asymmetries of the external force @xcite or mixing of chaotic and regular phase space regions @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms offer an ideal arena to test this phenomenology , as can be seen from the experiments implementating both dissipative and conservative ratchets @xcite .",
    "these experiments rely on the force imparted by near or far from resonance laser beams which act on the atoms over short periods of time .",
    "these flashing potentials implement variants of the @xmath0-kicked rotor model and lead to phenomena such as dynamical localization . on the theoretical side we must remark the discovery of directed transport on quantum mechanical systems whose classical counterpart is completely chaotic @xcite .",
    "the present work aims at exploiting the fact that quantum ratchets can be used to transport quantum states and thus distribute entanglement between distant nodes , a basic task for quantum information and computation purposes @xcite . within this context , we find two distinct research directions . on the one hand ,",
    "entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation @xcite can be used to build efficient quantum repeaters @xcite for long distance communication . on the other hand , on a smaller scale , a relevant effort has been recently devoted to study quantum state transfer using static local hamiltonians which act on chains of spins , harmonic oscillators , or bosons in optical lattices @xcite . compared to these works , time - dependent ( non - adiabatic ) models , such as the one presented here ,",
    "provide more degrees of freedom to optimize the efficiency , speed and robustness of the quantum transport .",
    "moreover , the scheme we propose here for quantum state transport can be seen as a quantum ratchet induced without breaking translational and time reversal symmetries in the forces .",
    "the transport is just triggered by the symmetry breaking of the initial state .",
    "we illustrate this with a particular and simple implementation of quantum state transport based on two - level bosonic ultracold atoms in optical superlattices .",
    "more specifically the transport is achieved as follows .",
    "all the atoms are initially prepared in the , say , down state . at a given site ( write port ) an arbitrary qubit state is imprinted in the atom . the trapping potential is then modulated smoothly and periodically in time and in space .",
    "depending on the initial asymmetric position of the atom , being in an even or odd lattice site , the qubit state is transported rightwards or leftwards to any desired lattice site ( read port ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice ] ] without precise individual addressing .",
    "we consider both free and interacting particles . to our knowledge , this is the first time many - body interactions are taken into account in hamiltonian ratchets .    from the implementation point of view",
    ", this work is inspired by recent advances in the control and manipulation of optical superlattices @xcite .",
    "present experiments can create periodic potentials such as the ones depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice ] , achieving a great control on the time - dependence of the potential heights , and even being able to measure the number of atoms on the even and odd sites @xcite .",
    "these tools suffice for the protocol devised in this work .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : superlattice ] we introduce our system , made of a chain of atoms in an optical superlattice .",
    "we state the goal of this work , which is to transfer a quantum state between two arbitrary lattice sites using a translationally invariant modulation of the superlattice , and we present the bose - hubbard hamiltonian that models the dynamics of the atoms . in sect .",
    "[ sec : u=0 ] we study the case of noninteracting particles and find that it is possible to induce directed transport with arbitrary speed . in sect .",
    "[ sec : interacting ] we discuss a more realistic setup in which atoms interact .",
    "we design a ratchet hamiltonian with the help of optimal quantum control , and find that we can still induce perfect quantum transport with a speed limited by the interaction strength .",
    "the details of the optimal quantum control technique are left to sect .",
    "[ sec : control ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] we study the optical superlattice modulation in more detail , discussing the experimental challenges for implementing these quantum ratchets in current experiments . finally , in sect .  [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results and comment on possible extensions .",
    "in this work we consider the setting of ultracold neutral atoms trapped in an optical superlattice . an optical lattice is a standing wave of coherent off - resonance light created by the interference of two or more laser beams . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , such standing wave behaves as a periodic potential that confines the atom in the minima or maxima of intensity .",
    "the optical superlattice arises from a combination of two potentials with different periods . in the simplest case",
    "the superlattice potential can be written as follows @xmath1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the strengths of the lattice along the main axis and transversely to it , and @xmath4 is the momentum of the photons . in order to have a configuration of decoupled 1d lattices @xcite",
    ", the transverse potential @xmath3 has to be much larger than the recoil energy @xmath5 to prevent tunneling between 1d lattices . on top of this potential and along the main axis",
    "we find another lattice of strength @xmath6 , with half the period of the original one and a possible dephasing @xmath7 .",
    "this yields to the optical superlattice that creates the double - well structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice ] .",
    "we are interested in the regime of deep lattices in which atoms are confined to the lowest bloch band of the periodic potential .",
    "we assume the atoms to be bosons with two internal states . under those circumstances",
    "the dynamics of the atoms can be modeled using a bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite which , for a single 1d tube of lattices , has the form @xmath8.\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fock operators that annihilate and create particles on the @xmath11-th site of the lattice and in one of two internal states , @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is the on - site interaction between atoms , which we assume to be spin independent , and @xmath14 is the tunneling amplitude , which may vary from site to site .    in order to describe the dynamics of the atoms , eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) has to satisfy two conditions .",
    "first of all , the tunneling @xmath14 between different wells has to be small , so that there effectively exists a low energy band formed by the localized states on each site .",
    "this implies that the superlattice can not drop the barrier between pairs of sites too much [ fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice ] ] , for otherwise we would have to use a multiband model .",
    "the second condition is that the on - site interaction @xmath13 must be small compared to the energy gap between bloch bands .",
    "both condition are easily met in current experiments with optical superlattices @xcite , and have been taken into account throughout this work [ see sect .  [",
    "sec : experiments ] ] .",
    "our objective is as follows .",
    "we initially prepare all the two - level atoms in the same state , say the down state @xmath15 .",
    "we imprint an arbitrary quantum state on a particular site of the lattice , the _ write port _",
    ", in such a way that the atom ends up in a superposition of both spin states , @xmath16 .",
    "the goal is to create , by modulating the energy barriers of the optical superlattice , a ratchet effect that will transport this state a predetermined distance , to another site , the _ read port _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice ] .",
    "the modulation of the superlattice will not break the translational invariance and it will also be periodic in time ( with a period equal to @xmath17 ) , alternating the roles of the hopping between even ( @xmath18 ) and odd ( @xmath19 ) sites @xmath20    the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , being translationaly invariant in time and in space , does not exert any force on the atoms , as expected from a quantum ratchet . this can be verified by computing the integral of the forces acting on an atom in a well of the lattice . in particular , the following average is zero @xmath21 note however that our superlattice does not have a permanent asymmetry on the unit cell @xmath22 , unlike other hamiltonian flashed ratchets with saw - tooth profiles @xcite .    while the average force acting on the atoms is zero , we will show that there is still transport .",
    "the reason is the _ asymmetry of the initial state _ @xmath23 and the fact that our time - dependent hamiltonian will perform perfect swaps between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "all of this leads , after @xmath24 swaps of duration @xmath25 , to a propagation of the imprinted qubit rightwards or leftwards @xmath26 depending on the starting site . note also that by design , we will achieve the transport of the quantum state without actually moving any atom , thus leaving the number of atoms per site invariant .",
    "finally , let us mention that this scheme can also be used to distribute entanglement in the same fashion as in @xcite .",
    "namely by imprinting a maximally entangled state in two neighboring lattice sites . since atoms in odd and even sites move on opposite directions , the atoms will depart from each other and entanglement will get distributed between arbitrarily distant lattice sites .",
    "we start with the case of noninteracting particles @xmath27 .",
    "this case is relatively easy to study as all particles can be treated independently and therefore we can focus on the dynamics of a single particle that starts from different sites , a problem which is integrable .",
    "the basis of states is now denoted by @xmath28 is mapped after a given time , @xmath29 , to a state with that particle on site @xmath30 , the reading port , in a deterministic fashion .",
    "note also that since particles do not interact we do not have to consider the dynamics of particles on other lattice sites . nevertheless , as we show below , it is possible to look for solutions that do not give energy to these other particles and leave the density profile invariant . if the number of atoms per lattice site is constant , we can then talk about transport of the quantum state and not of particles themselves [ fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice ] ] .    as described before",
    ", we will adopt two restrictions .",
    "the first one is that the couplings do not break the translational invariance but are modulated in time , with the roles of @xmath31 and @xmath32 being exchanged after a time @xmath25 , as from eq .",
    "( [ periodicity ] ) .",
    "the second one is to assume that the tunneling can be brought to zero , so that @xmath33 during the time in which @xmath34 we have ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 \\mathbb{i}+ i \\sin[\\theta(t ) ] \\sigma^x\\ }    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}a_{2n+1}(0 ) \\\\",
    "a_{2n+2}(0)\\end{array}\\right ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a pauli matrix and @xmath38 .",
    "the simplest solution of this kind is a square signal , @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3level]b .",
    "this means that for @xmath40 we achieve a perfect swap between even and odd sites up to an irrelevant global phase . in practice",
    "the tunnelings @xmath32 and @xmath31 will evolve smoothly and require some time to reach a nonzero value . in that case",
    "the time for perfect switch will be given by @xmath41 .",
    "it is possible to construct arbitrarily fast solutions of also arbitrary smoothness .",
    "note , however , that the value of the average hopping is inversely proportional to the modulation period , @xmath42 , so that a fast solution may require a lattice with an unrealistically large hopping .",
    "the case of interacting particles is more realistic but also more difficult .",
    "we can no longer regard the particles as independent and collisions can affect the phase of the transported state , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) .",
    "we will still look for simple solutions that concatenate a swap dynamics on pairs of lattice sites , with the restrictions introduced in sec .",

    "the position may oscillate between pairs wells , but there is always a net average transport .",
    "the two solutions derived above , that is the piecewise constant and the smooth ones , are designed to induce transport on a chain of particles . however , in practice such a chain will have some endpoints or particles that stand near an empty site",
    ". we can then have three scenarios : ( i ) that a particle standing near a hole ends up in the original site at time @xmath79 ; ( ii ) that the particle and the hole are swapped and , more generally , ( iii ) that the particle and the hole end up in some coherent superposition of being on each site .",
    "out of these processes , only the latter will affect the evolution of the state we want to transport , since there is a small probability that it gets reflected .",
    "holes only have a disturbing effect on the transport if @xmath80 , since in the noninteracting case surrounding particles are equivalent to holes .",
    "note however that we can effectively eliminate the scenario ( iii ) if we impose that the hopping on half a period leaves the particle invariant @xmath81 while this restriction can not always be achieved for the piecewise constant profile , it can be easily incorporated to our optimal control toolbox .",

    "this hopping can be suppressed by making @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which is large enough to effectively suppress hopping every second site . given this constraint ,",

    "this is done for each possible value of @xmath95 , by computing numerically the ground state wavefunction of a particle in a double - well , @xmath96 , and the first excited state .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wannier ] .",
