    "we will look at theories with action of the form @xmath14 note that we use units in which @xmath15 and particle mass have been set to unity .",
    "the naively discretized action is in this case simply @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "key investigations regarding numerical evaluation of path integrals were presented in the reviews of barker and henderson @xcite , kalos and whitlock @xcite , and ceperley @xcite , as well as in the papers by pollock and ceperley @xcite and barker @xcite . a modern and extensive reference on the subject of path integrals",
    "is given in the latest edition of the textbook by kleinert@xcite .",
    "as we can see , the very definition of path integrals makes it necessary to make the transition from the continuum to the discretized theory .",
    "this discretization , however , is far from unique .",
    "in fact , the details of the discretization procedure are extremely important both for analytical and numerical treatment of path integrals .",
    "this dependence on discretization procedure has been one of the principle impediments to creating a consistent mathematical theory of path integration . on the numerical side , this manifests itself in the fact that path integral simulations remain notoriously demanding of computing time ",
    "so much so that certain path integral calculations serve as benchmarks for new generations of supercomputers .",
    "for this reason let us note that we have the freedom to make two important choices that will not affect the final result , i.e. the continuum amplitude we seek to calculate .",
    "first , we have the freedom to choose the point in the interval @xmath19 $ ] in which to evaluate the potential @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that different points correspond to different ordering prescriptions in the operator formalism .",
    "the choice of the middle point @xmath21 is the most common one .",
    "it corresponds to the symmetric or weyl ordering of operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and so always leads to a hermitean expression for the hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "two other prescriptions are also often used .",
    "the left ordering prescription evaluates the potential at @xmath25 , the left boundary of the above interval ( in the operator formalism this corresponds to taking the @xmath22 s to the left of the @xmath23 s in all the products that appear in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "similarly , one defines the right ordering prescription .",
    "although they lead to somewhat simpler looking expressions , the left and right prescriptions do not in general give hermitean hamiltonians .",
    "let us note , however , that the class of theories given by eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) has a hamiltonian that is the sum of a @xmath22-dependent kinetic term and a @xmath23-dependant potential term and so has no ordering ambiguities . in this case",
    "different prescriptions lead to the same continuum amplitude  the discretized amplitudes do differ , but they tend to the same continuum limit",
    ".    the second , and more important freedom related to our choice of discretized action has to do with the freedom to introduce additional terms that explicitly vanish in the continuum limit",
    ". we will designate such discrete actions as effective actions .",
    "for example , the term @xmath26 where @xmath27 is regular when @xmath28 , does not change the continuum physics since it goes over into @xmath29 , i.e. it vanishes as @xmath30 .",
    "although such additional terms do not change the continuum physics they do affect the speed of convergence to that continuum limit .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a detailed exposition of a systematic analysis that leads to the best solution in the class of all equivalent effective actions , e.g. the effective action that leads to the fastest convergence of the associated discrete amplitude @xmath31 to the continuum expression .",
    "the uncovered speedup in the path integral algorithm is a direct consequence of new analytical input that has come from the study of the relation between discretizations of differing coarseness of the same theory .",
    "we have given a brief presentation of these ideas in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "the calculations that will be presented turn out to be simplest in the mid - point prescription .",
    "before we proceed with them it is useful to spend the next section in a brief overview of known results dealing with the speed of convergence to the continuum limit .",
    "in this section we will compare the speed of convergence of several different prescriptions to the continuum limit .",
    "the naive mid - point prescription satisfies @xmath32 for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 . by naive",
    "we mean that we use the naively discretized action given in eq .",
    "( [ actionn ] ) . on the other hand , in the naive",
    "left prescription the amplitude for @xmath35 converges much faster @xmath36 this behavior can be easily shown both analytically and numerically .",
    "we note in passing that this is strongly related to the well known result for the partition function evaluated using naive discretization in the left prescription @xcite , which follows directly from the above amplitude by integrating over @xmath33 ( to get the trace ) and writing the time of propagation @xmath37 as the inverse temperature @xmath38 , @xmath39 however , going back to the language of amplitudes , it is also easy to show that the amplitudes for different initial and final states converge slower , i.e. for @xmath40 we have @xmath41    the problems with the speed of convergence of off - diagonal amplitudes in the left prescription can be fixed very easily .",

    "( [ leftright ] ) is simply the average of @xmath31 and @xmath46 and so has an expansion in even powers of @xmath47 .",
    "we end this section by presenting the result obtained by takahashi and imada @xcite and independently by li and broughton @xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors used a generalized form @xcite of the trotter formula to increase the speed of convergence of the discretized partition function .",
    "their final result is a derivation of a formula for the effective potential @xmath48 .",
    "the authors showed that by using this effective potential ( in the left prescription ) one gets @xmath49    a recent analysis of this method can be found in jang et al @xcite .",
    "let us note that the crucial step in the derivation of the above effective potential from the generalized trotter formula uses the cyclic property of the trace , i.e. the above increase in the speed of convergence only holds for the partition function and not the amplitudes .",
    "a direct numerical simulation shows that amplitudes calculated using this effective potential converge just as fast as the amplitudes in the naive left prescription .",
    "said another way , it is only the integral over all the diagonal amplitudes that has the @xmath50 behavior and not any individual amplitude . a recent investigation by bond et al .",
    "@xcite has uncovered a @xmath51 behavior , however , not for the case of a generic theory . at the end",
    "let us mention that several related investigations dealing with speed of convergence have focused on improvements in short time propagation @xcite or the action @xcite .",

    "( [ tildes ] ) will yield new types of terms in @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , the class of actions closed to transformation ( [ tildes ] ) is of the form @xmath63 the functions appearing in the above effective action also depend on the time step @xmath64 .",
    "we choose not to display this dependence explicitly in order to have a more compact notation .",
    "what is important is that all of these functions are regular in the @xmath65 limit .",
    "note that these effective actions are equivalent to our starting action , i.e. they all have the same continuum amplitudes as the starting theory .",

    "are generated by a gaussian distribution function obtained using a semi - classical expansion .",
    "the computing time of this algorithm scales as @xmath165 since it is necessary to diagonalize the quadratic form in the exponential of the distribution function . in the second algorithm we implemented the bisection method @xcite , which scales as @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , the bisection algorithm is the method of choice for large values of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "our method allows us to obtain very precise results using small values of @xmath0 . in that region",
    "we have found the two algorithms to be comparable both in precision and running time .    in both algorithms we needed to use a random number generator which gives a large number of uncorrelated random numbers in a fashion suitable for parallel programming .",
    "our primary random number generator was the scalable parallel random number generator library @xcite ( sprng ) .",
    "following the good practise suggested by ferrenberg et al .",
    "@xcite we have checked all our results using a different random number generator .",
    "checks were made with the numerical recipes ran3 generator @xcite with a different seed for each mpi process .",
    "agreement was in all cases well within a 1-@xmath167 interval implying that there were no hidden systematic errors present in either the algorithms or the random number generators .",
    "we note in passing that the analytical derivations presented in this paper work equally well in both the euclidean and minkowski formalism ( with appropriate @xmath168 regularization ) , i.e. they are directly applicable to quantum systems as well as to statistical ones . however , the monte carlo simulations used to numerically document our analytical results necessarily needed to be done in the euclidean formalism .",
    "to conclude , we have presented an algorithm that leads to significant speedup of numerical procedures for the calculating of path integrals of a generic theory .",
    "the increase in speed is the result of new analytical input that has emerged from a systematic investigation of the relation between different discretizations of the same theory .",
    "we have presented an explicit procedure for obtaining a set of effective actions @xmath1 that have the same continuum limit as the starting action @xmath169 , but which approach that limit ever faster .",
    "amplitudes calculated using the @xmath0-point discretized effective action @xmath170 satisfy @xmath171 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are initial and final states , @xmath37 the time of propagation , and @xmath134 the sought - after amplitude of the continuum theory .",
    "we have obtained and analyzed the effective actions for @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we quote expressions up to @xmath115 ( see the appendix ) , the rest can be found on our web site @xcite .    at the end",
    "we illustrated the obtained generic results by analyzing the speedup for different values of @xmath3 in the case of concrete monte carlo simulations of two different models : anharmonic oscillator with quartic coupling and particle in a modified pschl - teller potential .",
    "extensions of the derived algorithm to @xmath172 particles and @xmath173 dimensions , as well as to quantum field theories are both in progress . in both cases",
    "the derivation of the analogue of integral eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) does not seem to present a problem .",
    "the asymptotic expansion used to solve it is also directly generalizable .",
    "however , the algebraic recursive relations that determine @xmath1 will be more complex and may practically limit us to smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "in this appendix we present the effective action at level @xmath115 . note that this solution contains within it the effective actions at",
    "all lower levels  all one needs to do is to truncate the @xmath115 solution at the appropriate order in the @xmath64 expansion .",
    "for example , the effective potential @xmath20 at the @xmath103 level is obtained from the @xmath115 level potential by disregarding term that are @xmath84 and higher .",
    "code containing @xmath1 for @xmath5 is available on our web site @xcite .",
