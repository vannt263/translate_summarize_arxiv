    "the galactic center ( gc ) region has many celestial objects such as a supermassive black hole sagittariusa@xmath4 ( sgra@xmath4 ) , star - forming regions , dense molecular clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "the gc region is also full of high - energy phenomena .",
    "for example , several supernova remnants ( snrs ) or candidates have been recently found ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most characteristic phenomenon is the diffuse 6.7-kev lines from highly ionized irons ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of this emission is probably due to a plasma with @xmath6  6.5 kev temperature @xcite , but is still a debatable issue .",
    "another notable feature in the gc region is the clumpy 6.4-kev lines from neutral irons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin is considered as mcs illuminated by x - rays or electrons .",
    "some of the 6.4-kev clumps are well explained by the irradiation of the past x - ray flare from sgra@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "1e  1740.7@xmath02942 was discovered by the einstein observatory @xcite in the direction of the gc region , and was found to be the brightest gc source at above 20  kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the time variation of the flux and the spectrum of 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 are similar to those of cygnusx-1 , the archetypal black hole candidate , and hence 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 has been considered to be a black hole candidate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "granat detected a prominent bump on the spectrum of 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 at 300600 kev , which was interpreted as an electron - positron annihilation line at 511  kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus 1e  1740.7@xmath02942 is named the `` great annihilator '' ( ga ) .",
    "however , no evidence for the annihilation line has been found so far by other satellites ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the vla radio observations discovered a radio counterpart of the ga and non - thermal double jet - like structures emanating from the ga @xcite , and hence the ga is a `` micro quasar '' .",
    "like the other galactic jet sources , the ga would be a binary system with a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "in fact , the possible orbital period of 12.73 days was discovered by @xcite .",
    "however , no clear companion star was found with the optical , infrared or radio observations , due mainly to the strong interstellar absorption toward the gc region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the ga below 10 kev is explained by an absorbed power - law model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported the extended x - ray emission which is perpendicular to the radio - jets ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the integral observations suggested that the spectrum in the 10100  kev band is explained by a model of either a comptonized - plasma plus a power - law or two comptonized - plasmas @xcite .",
    "the radio observations found a giant mc near the ga ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "then the authors proposed the bondi - hoyle accretion mechanism @xcite ; the ga is in the mc , and is powered by the gas accretion from the mc .",
    "however the asca observations found no clear evidence for dense gas around the ga ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in order to investigate the accretion mechanisms ,",
    "whether the bondi - hoyle process , due to a binary companion or else , we performed the suzaku observation on the ga , with its high - quality spectrum and low background .",
    "the other objective of the observation is to discover local structures , if any , on the ga and in the close vicinity of the ga , and investigate the physical relation to the ga .",
    "we assume the distance to the gc to be 8.5  kpc in this paper .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     two pointing observations toward the ga were performed in september 2008 with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) at the focal plane of the x - ray telescope ( xrt : @xcite ) on board the suzaku satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observation log is given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the xis system consists of three sets of front - illuminated ( fi ) ccd cameras ( xis0 , 2 and 3 ) and one set of a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd camera ( xis1 ) .",
    "the performance of the ccd cameras has been gradually degraded due to the radiation damage by cosmic - ray particles , thus the spaced - row charge injection ( sci ) technique was introduced to restore the energy resolution since october 2006 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the sci , xis energy resolutions ( fi / bi ) at 5.9  kev were 155/175  ev ( fwhm ) during the observations .",
    "however , xis2 is unusable for scientific observations because of the sudden anomaly in 2006 , and we use the data from the remaining three cameras .",
    "the xrt consists of closely nested thin - foil reflectors and has large collecting efficiency ( 450  @xmath7 at 1.5  kev and 250  @xmath7 at 7  kev per xrt ) .",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) of the xrt is about in a half - power diameter .",
    "each ccd camera has the @xmath8 field of view .",
    "the band pass of the xis+xrt is 0.312  kev .",

    "the data were screened with the processing version 2.2.11.22 to exclude the events taken during passages of the south atlantic anomaly , the night - earth elevation angle @xmath9 , and the day - earth elevation angle @xmath9 .",
    "the effective exposures of the screened data are listed in table [ table1 ] .",

    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1.eps    ( 80mm,55mm)fig2.eps    in figure [ figure1 ] , we also see local structures around the ga , partly due to the tail ( spill - over ) of the psf of the xrt , but some are real x - ray structures .",
    "the major x - ray emissions around the ga are the galactic center diffuse x - rays ( gcdx : @xcite ) .",
    "the gcdx is characterized by the strong lines of fe k@xmath1 , s k@xmath1 , and fe k@xmath1 at the respective energies of 6.4  kev , 2.45  kev and 6.7  kev .    in order to investigate the fluxes of the prominent lines and their spatial variations in the observed field",
    ", we make the 2.08.0  kev band spectrum from the entire field shown in figure [ figure1 ] except the -radius circle centered at the ga and the calibration source regions . the spectrum is shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "we fit the spectrum with a phenomenological model of an absorbed power - law continuum plus gaussian lines .",
    "we hereafter use the cross sections from @xcite with the solar abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "then we see prominent lines at 6.4  kev , 2.45  kev and 6.7  kev above the best - fit continuum ( dashed line in figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the 6.4-kev line comes from mcs and hence has clumpy spatial distribution ( the 6.4-kev clumps , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the 6.7-kev line comes from the _ kt _  @xmath2  6.5  kev plasma ( the 6.5-kev plasma ) and is reported to be more uniform .",

    "the continuum - subtracted line images are shown in figure [ figure3 ] , where the -radius circle centered at the ga is excluded to emphasize the surrounding structures .",
    "we correct the vignetting effect and smooth with a gaussian kernel of @xmath10 = .    in the 2.45-kev line image ( figure [ figure3]a )",

    ", we find a clump in the north ( left - side of figure [ figure3]b ) of the ga , and name the clump m359.23@xmath00.04 .",
    "we note that no local structure in the 6.7-kev line image ( figure [ figure3]c ) is found .",
    "this supports that the 6.7-kev line ( the 6.5-kev plasma ) is uniform , at least near and around the ga .",

    "no significant periodicity is found in the light curve in the time range of 810000 sec .",
    "also , no flux - variation larger than 10% is found in the time scale longer than 512 sec .",
    "we therefore sum the data in all the observations and make the x - ray spectrum from the source region ( the solid circle in figure [ figure1 ] ) . the background spectrum made from the dashed box in figure [ figure1 ]",
    "is subtracted after correcting the difference of the effective area . for the correction of the effective area ,",
    "we take into account the energy dependence of the effective area with the method given in @xcite .",
    "we then fit the 2.512.0  kev band spectrum with an absorbed power - law model .",
    "since a clear iron absorption edge at 7.1 kev is found , the iron abundance for the photoelectric absorption is treated as a free parameter , although the abundances of the other elements are fixed to the solar values .",
    "we find an excess bump at 3.2  kev , which may be the calibration error of the xrt au m - ii edge ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we add a gaussian at this energy with the fixed line - width of 0.1  kev ( 1 @xmath10 ) .",
    "since the 6.4-kev line carries important information for the circumstellar gas around the ga ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , we add a gaussian line at 6.4  kev and fit the spectrum .",

    "the error due to possible flux variation in the background spectrum would be small , because the background spectrum is made from the region where the 6.4-kev - line flux is smoothly distributed ( see figure [ figure3]b ) . for a more quantitative estimate , we drive the 6.4-kev - line flux in every -radius segment in the entire region of figure [ figure3]b , excluding the areas of the ga and m359.23@xmath00.04 .",

    "we find that the spectrum clearly extends to the hard band and that it shows several emission lines from highly ionized atoms in the soft band .",
    "the line structures in the soft band are due to a hot thin plasma , while the main origin of the hard band x - rays is spill - over of the ga flux due to the tail of the psf of the xrt . using the best - fit spectra of the ga ( table 2 ) ,",
    "we simulate the spill - over flux and spectrum by the ray - tracing software ( xissimarfgen ) .",

    "two possibilities may be considered for this excess .",
    "the first is the under - subtraction of the gcdx plasma of _ kt _ @xmath2 6.5  kev , due to possible non - uniformity near the ga .",
    "this possibility may be negligible , because we neither see a local enhancement in the 6.7  kev line image ( figure [ figure3]c ) nor a hint of the 6.7-kev line in the g359.12@xmath00.05 spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , we add a 6.5-kev plasma to the fitting - model , and find that the possible contamination of the gcdx is less than 15% in the 110 kev band .",
    "the second possibility is a calibration error of the spill - over component .",
    "we therefore allow the spill - over flux to be a free parameter .",
    "the fit is improved to @xmath26/_d.o.f _ = 1.09 ( _ d.o.f _ = 164 ) .",
    "the additional excesses in the hard band are respectively 31% ( fi ) and 23% ( bi ) of those estimated with the nominal psf calibration .",
    "the nominal psf calibration uncertainties beyond are 5% and 15% in fi and bi , respectively .",
    "we note that the psf calibration was performed in the on - axis angle and concentric circle regions .",
    "our observations were , on the other hand , performed in the off - axis angle ( @xmath2 ) and the source region is non - concentric around the ga .",
    "we hence compare the simulated flux _ vs _ observed flux using the seyfert galaxy mcg@xmath052316 , which is the off - axis angle observation @xcite . unlike the ga in the gcdx , mcg@xmath052316 is located off the galactic - plane , where the major x - ray background is the cosmic  x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "the cxb is spatially more uniform than the gcdx .",
    "therefore we can obtain more reliable fluxes on and around the source .",
    "we also adopt the non - concentric region from the mcg@xmath052316 , the similar region of g359.12@xmath00.05 .",
    "then we compare the flux of the observed data ( after the subtraction of the nxb and cxb ) and that of the ray - tracing simulation by the xissim software . as a result",
    ", we find that the disagreements are 21% and 11% in fi and bi , respectively .",
    "extrapolating linearly these values to the off - angle position ( ) , we can expect the uncertainties are 36% ( fi ) and 19% ( bi ) , which are consistent with our best - fit results .",
    "thus the second possibility is very likely .",
    "we should note that any possible hard x - ray excess does not significantly change the best - fit thin thermal plasma model of the soft x - rays within errors at the 90  % confidence level apart from giving a lower plasma temperature by @xmath2 0.2 kev .",

    "the same argument can also be applied to m359.23@xmath00.04 , and thus the scenario of sgra@xmath4 origin is possible .    in figure",
    "[ figure7 ] , we find other 6.4-kev clumps at near mc1 and mc4 .",
    "the 6.4-kev fluxes of them are @xmath2 2 times fainter than that of m359.23@xmath00.04 , and hence the physical association is less clear .",
    "the other mcs , mc5 and mc6 , show no association to the 6.4-kev emissions .",
    "these features may not be surprising , if the putative past flare was variable in the time scale of a few years @xcite .    on the other hand , the scenario of the ga origin can be more easily assessed , if the real distances ( not projected distances ) of these clumps from the ga are 1.4 times larger than those of mc2 or mc3 , because the 6.4-kev fluxes from mc1 , mc4 , mc5 , and mc6 are less than half of those from mc2 or mc3 .",
    "the observed column density of the ga is @xmath53 .",
    "if the ga is associated with m359.23@xmath00.04 ( see section 4.1 ) , the ga lies in the gc region , because @xcite showed that mcs of cs(__j__=10 ) are in the gc region . in this case",
    ", the large @xmath54 of the ga is explained by intrinsic absorption @xcite of the order of @xmath55  @xmath20 .",
    "we constrain the upper - limit for the _ _ ew__@xmath14 of 8  ev .",
    "the iron abundance is also accurately determined to be 1.381.44 solar .",
    "if the ga is fully covered by the gas for @xmath56 = 4@xmath57 steradian , the upper - limit of _ _ ew__@xmath58 constrains the column density of the circumstellar gas within 7.5  pc ( at 8.5 kpc ) to be _ _",
    "n__@xmath41 @xmath59 4@xmath8 10@xmath60  @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the implication of the small value of _ _ ew__@xmath14 was discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "here we discuss briefly following @xcite , based on the more severe constraint of _ _ ew__@xmath14 ( _ _ ew__@xmath14 = 15 ev in @xcite _ vs _ 8 ev in our case ) .",
    "the _ _ ew__@xmath14 of 8 ev implies that the local density near the ga is less than 2 @xmath8 10@xmath61  h  cm@xmath24 . from figure 6 of @xcite , the velocity of the ga must be less than 7  km  s@xmath16 under the bondi - hoyle accretion mechanism even if the ga has the mass of 20  .",
    "since no data of the velocity dispersion for a black hole are available , we refer to that of the radio pulsars ( neutron stars ) from @xcite .",
    "we then conclude that the possibility of the ga with a smaller velocity than 7  km  s@xmath16 is only @xmath63% .",
    "thus the bondi - hoyle accretion for the ga is extremely unlikely .    although the observed _ _",

    "n__@xmath41 @xmath59 4@xmath8 10@xmath60  @xmath20 ( this value is averaged over 4@xmath57 steradian ) , the intrinsic _ _ n__@xmath48 determined from the low energy absorption is in the order of @xmath55  @xmath20 . thus the large circumstellar gas should be localized in front of the ga .",
    "@xcite reported that an mc is associated to the ga , but no mc is found in the line of sight to the ga from @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency may come from the poor spatial resolution of the former observation .",
    "in fact , the spatial resolution of the former observation is @xmath2  , while the latter is @xmath2  .",
    "our implication is consistent with @xcite , and hence one possible scenario for the large absorption is due to an accreting gas ; the ga is a binary system with a nearly edge - on accretion disk .",

    "we therefore propose that g359.12@xmath00.05 is an x - ray counterpart of g359.07@xmath00.02 . the thin thermal plasma spectrum and the physical parameters place g359.12@xmath00.05 to be an x - ray snr in the gc region . from the size of @xmath2 @xmath77 and the sound velocity of @xmath2 @xmath78 ( @xmath79 kev ) , the age of this snr",

    "if the ga is also located in the gc region ( see section 4.2 ) , g359.12@xmath00.05 may be physically associated with the ga .",
