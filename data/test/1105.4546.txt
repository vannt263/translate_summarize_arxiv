    "the observable baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) and the nonzero neutrino masses  @xcite provide strong evidences of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the possibility of unification of the gauge interactions is one of the most intriguing guiding principles for building theories beyond the sm , in this case called the grand unified theories ( gut ) .",

    "this model is ruled out since it can not :    * unify the measured sm gauge couplings ; * explain nonzero neutrino masses ; * unify the sm yukawa couplings of charged leptons and down quarks at high scale in the renormalizable level ; * explain present experimental lower bound on the proton lifetime of order @xmath7  years .",
    "the first two of these problems were solved by adding a new fermionic * 24 * representation  @xcite .",
    "however a whole set of high dimensional operators was needed to address the third problem .",
    "the renormalizable generalization of the model of @xcite with the minimal number of scalar fields contains only one new scalar @xmath8 representation  @xcite , so that the electroweak symmetry is broken by both @xmath9 and @xmath10 vevs , providing for realistic yukawas .",
    "ultimately , this nonsupersymmetric renormalizable adjoint @xmath0 theory contains scalars in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 , and matter in @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 .",

    "it is well known  @xcite that the neutrino masses may be generated through type i  @xcite and type iii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms in the renormalizable adjoint @xmath0 model .",
    "in addition , the bau may be explained  @xcite by generating the lepton asymmetry in the out - of - equilibrium decays of fermion triplets responsible for the type iii seesaw , and converting it to a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron transitions  @xcite in the usual baryogenesis  @xcite via leptogenesis ( lg ) scenario  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate a new range of the parameters where neutrino masses get a sizable contribution from the one - loop coloured seesaw besides the tree level type i and iii seesaw mechanisms .",
