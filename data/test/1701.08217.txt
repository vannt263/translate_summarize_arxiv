    "the lagrangian points of a gravitationally bound two - body system are a feature of newtonian gravity .",
    "unlike general relativity ( gr ) newton s gravity admits analytic solutions for the two - body problem ; furthermore looking for the positions , on the joint orbital plane , where the attraction of both bodies on a negligible mass test particle counterbalances exactly the centrifugal force , one finds five points where such a condition is fulfilled , with an orbital angular velocity coinciding with that of the two main bodies around their common center of mass .",
    "the traditional labelling of the five points is @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the geometry of the system is as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig . 1 ] .",
    "+    three points ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) are saddle points of the effective potential ; in other words , the equilibrium there is unstable , however in the case of the sun / earth pair the instability is very mild .",
    "the remaining two points ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are real local minima so the equilibrium there is stable , though corresponding to a shallow potential well . when coming to a relativistic approach , even though we may guess that the situation is marginally or even negligibly different from the newtonian case , the existence of lagrangian points is a priori not garanteed so that the problem needs a careful discussion .",
    "hopefully the final conclusion is indeed that libration points ( lagrange points ) still exist also in a relativistic 2 plus 1 body configuration , at least in a range of masses including the sun / earth pair , even though no closed solution is available for the position of such points @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the set of the lagrangian points is that they form a configuration rigidly rotating together with the earth .",
    "this property has already been exploited many times for space missions , such as wmap , the herschel space observatory , planck ( all concluded ) and now gaia , in @xmath7 ; the deep space climate observatory , the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) and lisa pathfinder , in @xmath6 .",
    "the list is not exhaustive and many more missions are planned directed again to @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that proposals have been issued to exploit , for fundamental physics , the lagrangian points of the pair earth - moon @xcite .",
    "the stability of the positions with respect to one another and to the earth makes the lagrangian points appropriate to work as basis for a physical reference frame at the scale of the inner solar system .",
    "furthermore , considering the size of the `` graph '' having the @xmath11 s as knots , we may remark that the time of flight of electromagnetic signals going from one point to another is in the order of some 10 minutes or more ; such long time may act as a multiplier for the tiny asymmetries originated by the angular momentum of the sun and for the strain due to passing gravitational waves .",
    "the present paper will discuss the possibilities listed above , highlighting the advantages for fundamental physics experiments and for the positioning and guidance of spacecraft out of the terrestrial environment .",
    "in particular , we shall nickname lagrange the proposal of exploiting time of flight measurements along a closed path having @xmath11 points as vertices , in order to take advantage of the asymmetric propagation produced by the spin of the sun in the case of two counter - rotating electromagnetic signals .",
    "the use of one and the same loop will avoid delays due to different geometric paths for the two beams ; the cancellation of the purely geometric component of the time of flight will let the above mentioned asymmetry emerge .    in section [ sec - timedelay ]",
    "we discuss the gr time delay due to the sun ; then in subsection [ sec - delay ] , we specialize the analysis to the case where emitter , central body and receiver are aligned ( indeed a special case for lagrange ) . in the calculation , the contribution of the quadrupole of the central body will be included . in section [ lt ]",
    "the analysis will concern the more general configuration with a closed contour encompassing a wide area and the purpose will be the measurement of the solar gravitomagnetic effect with an accuracy better than @xmath4 . section [ sec : galactic ] evaluates the possibilities to retrieve information about a possible galactic gravito - magnetic field , if it is there .",
    "section [ sec : rps ] presents a relativistic positioning system ( rps ) based on a set of emitters of electromagnetic signals located at the mentioned l - points . in section [ other ]",
    "some additional opportunities given by the lagrangian reference system , including gravitational waves ( gw ) detection , are listed .",
    "methodological and technological challenges posed by the lagrange project are reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec - tech ] .",
    "a short conclusion closes the paper .",
    "a gravitational field produces a time delay and a deflection ( deviation ) on the propagation of electromagnetic waves . presently , we are interested only to describe the effects of the delays in time propagation , because the effects of the deflection on the time propagation are negligible with respect to the leading contributions .",
    "the main effect depends on the mass of the central body ( the sun ) and is fully explained in terms of the metric developed by schwarzschild in 1916 @xcite .",
    "therefore , these delays are related to the gravitoelectric field of gr @xcite .",
    "the first successful measurements were obtained by shapiro and collaborators by means of radar - echoes from earth to the planets mercury and venus @xcite .",
    "successively , anderson and collaborators @xcite repeated the measurement of the delay in the round trip time from the two spacecraft mariner 6 and 7 orbiting the sun .",
    "finally , shapiro @xcite and reasenberg @xcite obtained the most accurate results with this technique by means of a transponder placed on the surface of mars by the nasa mission viking .",
    "the agreement between the measured delay and its general relativity prediction was around 0.1% .",
    "this kind of measurements are quite important because they allow to constrain the ppn parameter @xmath12 , which measures the space curvature per unit of mass .",
    "currently , its best measurement has been obtained by the radar tracking of the cassini spacecraft during a superior conjunction with the sun along its cruise to saturn @xcite .",
    "bertotti and collaborators obtained @xmath13 .",
    "the advantage of the latter measurement relies on the doppler tracking ( not exploited before ) and the multi - frequency link ( both x - band and ka - band ) that allow for the plasma compensation of the solar corona .",
    "this delay , which is now known as the shapiro time delay , represents the first gr correction to the time propagation of an electromagnetic signal between an emitter and a receiver with respect to the time of propagation that is needed in the flat spacetime of minkowski .",
    "lagrange , with its multi - spacecraft configuration , would allow the measurement of the time delay in the propagation of the electromagnetic signals in several different geometrical configurations .",
    "at the same time , it would extend the measurement of the delay not only to the effect previously mentioned , the so - called shapiro time - delay , but also to the delay produced by the gravitomagnetic field @xcite of the sun and/or to that of the earth .",
    "for instance , referring to previous fig .",
    "[ fig . 1 ] , we can consider the propagation of light and the corresponding delay between the two equilateral lagrangian points @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this case , the impact parameter @xmath14 , the point of closest approach to the sun , is equal to 0.5 au , i.e. comparable with the other distances , avoiding the problem connected with the plasma of the solar corona , as well as the additional delay produced by the quadrupole moment of the sun .",
    "another very interesting geometrical configuration is the one represented by the two collinear points @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the propagation of signals between these two points will allow , for the first time , a direct measurement ( in the field of the earth ) of the overall delay on their propagation , as produced by the combined action of the mass and angular momentum of the earth plus the additional delay due to its oblateness . some of the corresponding measurements with lagrange will allow to improve the current limits in gravitational physics by exploiting the present know - how and accuracy in time of flight measurements and with the present state of art in atomic clocks precision and accuracy .",
    "conversely , other effects , in order to emerge from the noise , need an improvement in the current technology of time measurements . the lagrange measurements would be based on the application of null geodesics around a spinning body in the weak field and slow motion limit ( wfsm ) of gr . in terms of metric , the kerr metric will be the reference @xcite , or , to say better , its weak field limit @xcite , with a non - diagonal component @xmath15 proportional to the intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) @xmath16 of the central body .",
    "we consider a quasi - cartesian coordinate system at the post - newtonian level with origin in the central ( deflecting and delaying ) body .",
    "we consider the propagation in the @xmath17 plane ( coincident with the plane of the ecliptic ) and assume that the angular momentum @xmath18 of the body is along the _ z - axis _ and that this axis is also the symmetry axis of the body ( i.e we assume cylindrical , or axial , symmetry ) . in particular , we assumed a standard isotropic pn approximation @xcite where the receiver ( or observer ) has to be considered positioned along the positive _ y - axis_. under the above approximations , the line element can be written as : @xmath19 where or @xmath20 represents the time - time component of the metric , while the other terms provide spatial and mixed contributions . ]",
    "@xmath21 in the above expressions , @xmath22 represents the speed of light , @xmath23 the ( invariant ) proper time , @xmath24 the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath16 the angular momentum of the central body , @xmath25 the distance in the reference plane , @xmath26 the kronecker symbol and , finally , @xmath27 represents the gravitational potential @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the mass , radius and quadrupole moment of the body .",
    "this configuration is particularly interesting when the delays in the propagation of the electromagnetic signal are analysed in order to take care also of , besides the contributions from the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields of gr , the effect in the time propagation produced by the quadrupole moment of the central object .    in the case of the propagation of electromagnetic waves we need to impose the condition of null geodesics with the further condition that we restrict to the propagation in the reference plane @xmath17 with @xmath32 constant and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ ppn - metric ] ) reduces to : @xmath34 we can now solve for the coordinate time element @xmath35 from eq .",
    "( [ ppn - metric - luce ] ) and integrate the final expression from the emitter position at @xmath36 up to the receiver ( or observer ) position at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 are positive quantities ) . for the propagation time @xmath40",
    "we finally obtain : @xmath41 where smaller contributions to the time delay have been neglected .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ delta_t ] ) accounts for the time propagation in the flat spacetime of special relativity .",
    "the second term represents the contribution from the gravitoelectric field of gr in the weak field approximation : it is the shapiro time delay .",
    "the third contribution arises from the gravitomagnetic field in the same approximation .",
    "the @xmath42 sign accounts for the chirality of this contribution : it is positive for a propagation of the signals in the same sense of rotation of the central mass , it is negative in the case of the opposite sense for the propagation .",
    "finally , the last term represents the contribution that arises from the oblateness of the central body .",
    "the solution provided in eq .",
    "( [ delta_t ] ) implies that emitter , central body and receiver have the same @xmath43 and @xmath44 coordinates ( with @xmath45 ) and differ only for the @xmath46 coordinate ( which is negative for the emitter , null for the central body and positive for the receiver ) .",
    "the result obtained in eq .",
    "( [ delta_t ] ) can be considered as a particular case of two results obtained in previous works @xcite .",
    "in fact , our result coincides with that obtained in @xcite when that work is restricted to the lensing effect which can be obtained for light propagating in their symmetry plane ( coincident with our reference plane ) with the transformations @xmath47 and @xmath48 in their expressions and with the further condition @xmath49 or @xmath50 in their final expressions for the delays due to the angular momentum and the quadrupole coefficient ( see in particular their section 2 ) ( not to be confused with the ppn parameter commonly designated by the same symbol ) and @xmath51 represent two of the euler angles that define the orientation of their symmetry plane with respect to the lens plane , while @xmath52 represents the angular position of a generic light ray over the lens plane . ] .",
    "conversely our first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ delta_t ] ) coincide with equations ( 55 ) , ( 56 ) and ( 57 ) of @xcite with the transformation @xmath53 for their @xmath38 and the approximation @xmath54 and @xmath55 for their coordinates .    by applying the measurements based on the propagation time determined with eq .",
    "( [ delta_t ] ) to the configuration @xmath0earth@xmath1 , it will be possible ( at least in principle ) to obtain a measurement of the earth s quadrupole coefficient in a way independent from the usual space geodesy techniques based on the inter - satellite tracking  by means of the two twin grace satellites @xcite  and from the precise orbit determination ( pod ) of laser - ranged satellites in orbit at a relatively high altitude , as in the case of the two lageos @xcite .",
    "considering that the distance between the two lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath56 m , and assuming an impact parameter @xmath14 of the order of the earth s radius @xmath57 m , for the propagation time of eq .",
    "( [ delta_t ] ) we obtain : @xmath58 where the contribution of each term has been highlighted .",
    "if we consider a round trip travel for the propagation time , the smaller contribution of the gravitomagnetic field cancels out when we consider the propagation on the same side of the earth , and the quadrupole effect can be extracted after modelling the shapiro delay and the larger effect of the propagation time in the flat spacetime of minkowski .",
    "the knowledge of the oblateness of the earth is particularly important because of its long - term variations in relation to the earth s internal structure and its mass distribution .",
    "in fact , phenomena like the melting from glaciers and ice sheets as well as mass changes in the oceans and in the atmosphere are responsible for variations in the rate of the global mass redistribution with a consequent time dependency in the quadrupole coefficient characterized by annual and interannual variations @xcite .",
    "this kind of measurement can be initiated by earth , the delaying body , with all the advantages of an earth based laboratory equipped with the best time - measuring apparatus to perform the experiment . in particular , optical clocks and lattice clocks based on @xmath59-atoms",
    "have reached outstanding fractional frequency instabilities down at a level of about @xmath60 or less , with @xmath61 the integration time @xcite .",
    "for instance , with an integration time of about @xmath62 s it is possibile to reach a precision in the measurement of the quadrupole coefficient of about @xmath63 , comparable with the current best determinations from earth ( with calibrated errors ) using the lageos data , and even better with longer integration times .",
    "the lense - thirring effect ( lt ) or inertial frame dragging by a moving massive body is a feeble effect of gr , first considered by thirring @xcite and lense and thirring @xcite in 1918 , while studying the influence of rotating masses ( in particular a rotating hollow massive spherical shell ) on a test particle .",
    "lt may also be considered as a manifestation of gravito - magnetism i.e. of that typical component of the gr gravitational interaction resembling the magnetic field of moving charges .",
    "so far , lt has been verified experimentally in a limited number of cases .",
    "the gravity probe b experiment measured the precession induced by the gravitomagnetic field of the earth on four orbiting gyroscopes , with a @xmath64 accuracy @xcite . a careful analysis of the orbits of the lageos and lageos 2 satellites , monitored by laser ranging , evidenced the lt drag of the nodes of the orbits with a @xmath65 accuracy @xcite .",
    "the ongoing lares experiment ( combined with the previous data from the two lageos ) has attained a @xmath66 accuracy @xcite . with a different technology ,",
    "the ginger experiment is under study and preliminary test of the technology .",
    "it is based on the use of a three - dimensional array of ring lasers to be located underground at the national gran sasso laboratories in italy @xcite .",
    "ring lasers are extremely sensitive rotation measuring devices .",
    "their operating principle is a gr evolution of the old sagnac effect @xcite ; what is measured in practice are frequency and amplitude of a beat between two stationary counter - propagating light beams in the ring .",
    "rotations , either of kinematical origin or due to the chirality of the gravitational field ( gravitomagnetic component ) , produce a right / left asymmetry of the propagation along the ring .",
    "the aim of ginger is to verify the terrestrial lt within @xmath4 or better .",
    "the use of the sun - earth lagrangian frame would allow a measurement of the solar gravitomagnetic field ( solar lt ) , exploiting the sagnac approach but resorting to time of flight measurements rather than to interference phenomena or beat tones .",
    "for our purpose we may start from the external line element of a steadily rotating body in a reference frame where the main mass is at rest and the axes do not rotate with respect to the distant sky ( to the quasars ) . as in the previous section ,",
    "weak field conditions are assumed , but now , for convenience , we use polar coordinates in space .",
    "it is :    @xmath67    if @xmath29 is the mass of the source , it is @xmath68 with the dimension of a length .",
    "similarly , if @xmath16 is the modulus of the angular momentum of the source , it is @xmath69 with the dimension of a squared length .",
    "the time variable is @xmath70 , again with the dimension of a length .",
    "the index @xmath71 labels the coordinates specific of the non - rotating , asymptotically flat reference frame . in the case of the sun",
    "it is :    @xmath72    it is convenient to use coordinates apt for a terrestrial ( or co - orbiting with the earth ) observer . in practice",
    "we need to combine a rotation of the axes at a rate @xmath73 corresponding to the orbital motion of the earth , together with a boost at the tangential speed of the earth on its orbit @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "what holds for the earth , holds for the lagrangian points too . since we are considering free fall",
    "the orbital rotation rate is keplerian , so that :    @xmath75    here @xmath30 is the radius of the orbit of the earth ( @xmath76 m ) , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "we may now restrict our attention to the orbital plane , so that it is @xmath79 . in the new reference frame and with the new coordinates",

    "then we see that the term containing the square root in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ds0 ] ) does not change sign when reversing the sense of motion along a given path , whereas the first term in the numerator does . since we are interested in the asymmetries in the propagation we consider the difference between the right- and left - handed time of flight along the same elementary section of the path ; in this way the square root cancels and the other term doubles . finally we integrate along the whole closed space trajectory and express the result in terms of the proper time of the observer .",

    "of course the corresponding null trajectories will be affected by the gravitational lensing due to the mass of the sun .",
    "however we know that the angular deviation due to the lensing effect is proportional to @xmath88 , so that its influence in the calculation of ( [ tofu ] ) is negligible . in practice",
    "we may assume the space trajectories of electromagnetic signals to be straight ; the typical equation is simple : @xmath89 the closest distance from the straight line to the center of the system is @xmath14 and the azimuth of the closest point is @xmath90 .",
    "suppose for example that a signal , propagating in the ecliptic plane , goes from position @xmath91 , with coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath93 to the arrival point @xmath94 with coordinates @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we easily work out the contribution of this stretch to the integral ( [ tofu ] ) :    @xmath97    let us apply the above result to a triangular loop having @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 at the corners .",
    "the coordinates in the plane of the ecliptic , measuring the angles from the sun - earth line , are : @xmath98    it is @xmath99 m , so that @xmath100 .",
    "the minimum distance from the @xmath101 ( or @xmath102 ) line and the center of the system is @xmath103    numerically : @xmath104 m. the angular coordinate of the minimum distance point , on one side or the other , is @xmath105 .",
    "coming to the @xmath106 line , it is @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "summing up , and considering the full triangle , we have : @xmath109    eq .

    "the challenge is to measure it in space .      besides making use of sun s angular momentum as a source of a lt field for a basic science experiment , i.e. for another precise test of gr , there are other , some even truly practical , reasons for such observations .",
    "it is widely believed that the observed differential rotation of the sun triggers a near - surface layer of rotational shear , known as _",
    "tachocline _ , where large - scale dipole magnetic fields are generated by dynamo action , ultimately leading to the 11-year solar cycle of sunspots @xcite .",
    "crucial to the possible role of the tachocline in the dynamo are its location and depth . while sun s photosphere can be directly observed and also neutrinos provide some direct information about processes in the core of our star , the tachocline is not directly observable .",
    "until now , all available information about this boundary layer between the radiative interior and the differentially rotating outer convective zone , have been collected via helioseismology observations , mainly using the solar and heliospheric orbiter ( soho ) and the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) probes @xcite .",
    "the estimated location of the shear layer at sun s equator is ( @xmath114 , i.e. beneath the convection zone base , and with a width of @xmath115 . using sun s density profile based on the standard solar model @xcite , the tachocline itself should contribute at the level @xmath116 to the total angular momentum of the sun , i.e. to the source of the lt field .",
    "although such precision of the solar lt field determination lies at the very edge of the expected lagrange project sensitivity , a periodic low frequency temporal variation of the lt field strength would open another window for sun interior studies .",
    "when addressing the effects of rotating massive bodies ( sun ) on a local space - time geometry in our planetary system , it is rational to consider also possible analogous effects originating from larger structures dynamics , i.e. from our galaxy or even more .",
    "the main reason is that fields associated with metric tensor components ( @xmath117 or @xmath15 as used in eq.s ( [ ppn - metric ] ) and ( [ line0 ] ) ) might mimic the effects typically associated to the presence of dark matter ( dm ) , i.e. additional centripetal acceleration ( @xmath118 ) and gravitational lensing ( effective refraction index @xmath119 ) .",
    "the gravito - magnetic field potential ( @xmath120 ) and field strength ( @xmath121 ) , rather than metric tensor components , are used for clearer analogy only .",
    "the best studied and quantified dm problem is related to the dynamic stability of dwarf and spiral galaxies . in the case of the milky way ( mw )",
    "the distribution of the accounted for luminous mass in stars ( @xmath122 ) , nonluminous interstellar gas and dust ( @xmath123 ) , central black hole ( @xmath124 ) and central bulge ( @xmath125 ) is not compatible with the observed nearly flat rotation curves [ @xmath126 of stars and gas in the disk @xcite .",
    "the same property of rotation curves for spiral galaxies has been confirmed for star - free , edge regions , via radio emission observations of neutral hydrogen @xcite . for the mw , the mutual gravitational attraction of stars , central black hole and interstellar dust provide a significant part ( nearly all ) of the required centripetal force at small distances ( up to @xmath127 kpc ) from the center , while flat rotation curves at larger distances ( above @xmath128 kpc ) undeniably point towards some other source of centripetal force @xcite .    the typical approach to address this problem is to postulate the presence of a large galactic halo , extending beyond @xmath129 kpc , consisting of massive nonluminous particles with isothermal spherical distribution . in such models ,",
    "the stabilizing effect of dm is being contemplated through a static gravitational field ( i.e. the @xmath130 component of the metric tensor ) due to the mass of the invisible halo .",
    "depending on the peculiar dm model , the total mass of the mw may be entirely dominated by the dark halo and could reach values ranging from @xmath131 @xcite up to @xmath132 @xcite .    using a naive but straightforward example , a lt field of @xmath133 s@xmath134 strength , would suffice to provide all necessary centripetal acceleration to account for the motion of the sun around the mw center with a tangential velocity @xmath135 km / s at @xmath136 kpc radius . according to a realistic mw mass distribution model @xcite",
    ", an additional force component is needed , to account for @xmath129 km / s of the total @xmath137 km / s orbital velocity .",
    "a local value of the lt field @xmath138 s@xmath139 would account for this additional centripetal force .",
    "similar values could be deduced for the m31 galaxy @xcite in which the rotational velocity term associated with the dm scenario provides a linearly growing contribution to the rotation curve with a slope of @xmath140 s@xmath134 .",
    "this result could also be interpreted as the influence of a homogenous lt field , perpendicular to the plane of the disk of the galaxy , with an identical intensity of @xmath141 s@xmath134 .",
    "the hypothesized lt field strengths are weaker than the current experimental possibilities @xcite but well within the lagrange project scope . on the contrary ,",
    "the galactic lt field strengths , calculated from known baryonic mass - velocity data , are typically much weaker : only @xmath142 s@xmath134 for the mw at the sun distance from the center .",
    "taking into account that none of the recent experiments have been able to detect the physical nature of dm ( see overview in @xcite ) and a clear observational evidence of a strong correlation between galactic baryonic content and plateau velocity of the rotation curves ( @xmath143 ) , expressed through the tully - fisher relation ( @xmath144 ) @xcite for more than @xmath145 rotationally supported galaxies of different masses and morphologies @xcite , constitutes a justified reason to consider alternatives to standard dm scenarios and assess the possible presence of local lt fields with strength in the @xmath146 s@xmath134 range .",
    "overwhelming share of non - baryonic energy - mass density , in coincidence with observed clustering of visible matter over a larger volume in the observable universe , suggests that other potential sources of lt fields , with strengths within the interval of interest , are viable . in that respect , even a residual primordial lt field , originating from the initial singularity and the subsequent fast evolution processes ( inflation era ) can not be excluded .",
    "presumed primordial lt fields would imprint on the cmb spectrum in a similar way as dm and would influence large scale structures evolution into characteristic filaments with congregated clusters of galaxies and large voids in between @xcite .",
    "similar filaments and voids structures and other relevant analogies are commonly observed in solid state systems @xcite .",
    "filaments of vortex lines of quantum vortices in superfluid helium or magnetic flux bundles in superconducting materials are the best examples .",
    "although such simple analogies can not guarantee they would have something in common with large scale structures in the universe , the existence of forces inside and among such filaments , originating from the interaction with the bulk of the medium ( space  time voids ) , looks a lot like dm and dark energy ( de ) effects .",
    "therefore local lt field search ( measurement ) might open another window into the dm and de problem .",
    "the solution adopted for global positioning on earth or in its vicinity is mainly based on the gps method and on the gps , glonass , galileo and other present or future satellites dedicated constellations . without entering into a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of that approach",
    ", it is easily agreed that it can not be extended beyond the near terrestrial environment or , at least , that the application to space navigation is an opportunity to reconsider the whole method , especially regarding the way to account for the effects of special and general relativity .",
    "an intrinsically relativistic positioning system ( rps ) has been proposed and is described in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the local timing of at least four remote independent sources of electromagnetic pulses ; the essence of the method is graphically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] . successive pulses ( but they could also be periodic equal phase hypersurfaces ) cover space - time by a regular four - dimensional lattice .",
    "the world - line of an observer intersects the walls of successive cells of the lattice ; the proper time interval measured by the observer between consecutive crossings provides the basic information . counting the pulses ( after identifying the various sources ) and applying a simple linear algorithm it is possible to calculate the coordinates ( including time ) of the receiver in the fiducial reference frame @xcite .",
    "s are the null wavevectors of the signals coming from the two ( four in the full space - time ) independent sources .",
    "the @xmath147 s label the null wavefronts of the pulses .",
    "the wiggling line is the worldline of the receiver .",
    "the dots show some of the intersection points ( reception of a signal ) .",
    "the relevant quantity is the length ( i.e. proper time span ) between successive reception events.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the dimensionless coordinates along the light cone of a source are expressed as the sum of an integer part @xmath148 ( the subscript @xmath149 labels the sources ) and of a fractional part @xmath150 .",
    "the integer is obtained just counting the successive arrivals of the pulses ; the fractional part is given by a simple linear algorithm applied to sequences of arrival times in the proper reference of the observer @xcite .",
    "projecting the @xmath151 light cone coordinates onto the axes of the fiducial reference frame finally produces the practical coordinates we are interested in .",
    "of course the sources may be orbiting satellites , but in that case you have to know with the best possible accuracy , the position of each satellite ( i.e. its real orbit ) while time passes .",
    "the situation would be far simpler if the position of the emitter were fixed in the fiducial reference frame .",
    "this possibility is implemented in nature if the signals come , for instance , from pulsars : their positions in the sky are indeed fixed or slowly moving at a well known rate ; furthermore pulsars are also very good clocks , even better , in the long term , than our atomic clocks .",
    "an exercise application of the rps , using pulsars , is presented in @xcite .",
    "the inconvenience of pulsars is that their pulses are extremely weak so that large antennas are needed and special techniques must be implemented in order to identify and extract the signal from an overwhelming noise .",
    "such troubles can be removed placing artificial `` pulsars '' in points that keep rigidly their positions in an appropriate reference system .",
    "that is indeed the case of the lagrangian points .",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , equipped with emitters of regular pulses would form a very interesting basis for a physical reference frame co - orbiting with the earth .",
    "@xmath5 has not been considered because it is located in the opposite side of the sun with respect to the earth , so being invisible from our planet .",
    "an important feature of the system is that the distances between the reference points range between @xmath152 million km approximately ( from @xmath0 or @xmath1 to the earth ) to @xmath153 million km ( from the earth to @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) .",
    "such large values dramatically reduce the effect of the geometric dilution which renders gps ( and the other terrestrial positioning systems ) useless when extended away from our planet .",
    "of course all lagrangian points lie in a plane , but that is usually the case also for most space missions and the size of the base allows for good results even for a couple of astronomic units out of the ecliptic plane .",
    "the spacecraft carrying the emitter devices could in general not coincide with the corresponding lagrange point , but would rather orbit around the point on stable ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) or on weakly unstable lissajous orbits ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the final accuracy of the positioning would depend mainly on the accuracy with which the instantaneous position on the orbit is known .",
    "the other limiting factor for the final result is the quality of the clock used by the receiver , but there it would be easy to attain centimeter accuracies or even better .",
    "besides the proposals already described in the previous sections , it is worth mentioning a number of other opportunities that a lagrangian frame as the one presented in this paper could lend .      among the weak gravitational effects of gr",
    "a long sought for , and now world - famous , one , are gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "after the recent detection of a signal from the merger of a pair of black holes @xcite the international effort to further detections has become even more intense than before . besides the terrestrial facilities , great hopes are put on the elisa space interferometers , when they will fly . in the same time , it is worth exploring various approaches to the way gw can be detected and there is one that can employ the same setup and method described for the lt measurement . in the @xmath154s of the past century sun , fejer ,",
    "gustafson and byer @xcite , starting from a previous idea of weiss , proposed and analyzed a so called zero - area sagnac interferometer for the detection of gw .",
    "the zero - area sagnac interferometer organizes the path of light beams so that the contoured area be zero . in practice",
    ", one has a pair of twisted half loops and each beam travels along the two loops once clockwise , once counter - clockwise .",
    "the consequence is that the signal of the kinematic and effective rotations cancel ; if , however , the strain induced by a gw is present , the transient difference in the metrics along the two arms of the interferometer maintains its effect and is recorded as a residual time depending asymmetry in the phases of the beams . on earth the principle works but the storage time in one arm of the interferometer can hardly be longer than a ms . in the case of our lagrangian system a zero - area configuration could be achieved including earth - based stations and using for instance an @xmath155 circuit . in that case the `` storage time '' ( here the flight time ) in a half loop would be in the order of one thousand seconds .",
    "the angle between the `` arms '' ( important in order the strain of the gw to be manifested ) would be @xmath156 rather than @xmath157 , but the permanence time would be @xmath158 times longer than in a terrestrial device . using eq.s ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( where a continuous harmonic wave is considered ) as a rule of thumb , we see that the length of the travel time could indeed , in the case of @xmath159mhz frequency of the wave , boost the signal by a factor @xmath160 . of course an application like this deserves a consideration much more attentive than this qualitative note , but it would be worth doing once lagrange had been put into operation .      once the lagrange stations would be _ in situ _ they would allow a number of additional scientific usages .    1 .   provided at least one of the spacecraft",
    "be equipped with optical devices , following the apparent position of @xmath2 or @xmath3 with respect to the background stars would give an interesting means to study the gravitational lensing in the solar system .",
    "once the `` artificial pulsars '' consisting in the emitters for the lagrange rps were active , they could be used as gauges for studying real pulsars .",
    "3 .   spacecraft located in @xmath2 and @xmath3 would be an interesting opportunity to study the space environment there and in particular the already discovered @xcite and maybe not yet discovered trojan asteroids there .",
    "4 .   monitoring the movements around the l - points would allow to map the gravitational field in the corresponding regions .",
    "the time measurements proposed in the previous sections are quite challenging , from both the point of view of science and technology , especially given the fact that the measurements will not take place in the `` earth laboratory '' .",
    "consequently , in order to verify the practical possibilities to carry out the measurements of the time - of - flight between two or more lagrange points , a number of studies devoted to investigate deeply the scientific and technological aspects are necessary . in this section ,",
    "we start by highlighting the main issues that should be considered and attacked in the future in order to guarantee the success of this proposal .    for practical reasons , we will discuss separately  at this first level  the science issues from the technological ones .",
    "of course , these two fields  science and technology  are not separated , but indeed tightly related to each other .",
    "the scientific aspects are mainly related to the gravitational physics of a three - body problem and of its gr interpretation .",
    "no exact solution exist for this problem , neither in classical celestial mechanics ( cm ) , nor in gr .",
    "in particular , since a spacecraft is massless with respect to both the earth and the sun , and since the orbit of the earth around the sun can be approximated as circular  at least in first approximation  for our purposes we can report our initial considerations to the restricted three - body problem of cm .    our approach will be based on the characteristic tools of perturbations theory for what concerns both gravitational and non gravitational perturbations .",
    "the n - body problem of cm will be simplified in the classical three - body problem of the sun - earth system , in the so - called restricted case .",
    "the variations with respect to the more general three - body problem and those related to the influences of a fourth - body will then be analysed perturbatively .",
    "the gr effects will be considered within the corrections of relativistic celestial mechanics , i.e. considering the gr effects in terms of disturbing potentials and accelerations to be treated perturbatively with the well known lagrange or gauss equations .",
    "we refer to the classical textbooks of celestial mechanics for details @xcite .",
    "as it was briefly mentioned earlier , the orbits of a spacecraft around the lagrangian points are not all stable , even if the lagrange points are points of equilibrium , i.e. they are points where the gradient of the potential is null .",
    "in fact , since we are in a rotating frame , the apparent forces come to play an important role .",
    "for instance , the two triangular points @xmath2 and @xmath3 , although they are points of maximum potential , are stable points because of the coriolis force , which acts as an attractive force .",
    "conversely , the three collinear points @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 are unstable points . therefore , a spacecraft in orbit around one of the triangular points will follow a periodic orbit .",
    "conversely , a spacecraft in orbit around one of the collinear points will undergo a lissajous orbit , with the necessity of periodic manoeuvres in order to keep the satellite sufficiently close to the unstable equilibrium point .    as a consequence of these very preliminary and quite general considerations we list below the first requirements that from both the scientific and conceptual point of view we need to investigate by means of dedicated studies .    1",
    ".   the solar system is of course not made of the sun - earth pair only .",
    "an analysis of the gravitational perturbations induced by the other celestial bodies is in order , both for the stability of the positions of the lagrangian points and for the influence on the signal that would be measured .",
    "2 .   all effects have to be analysed from the view point of gr in order to build a consistent interpretation frame for the data in view of the expected results .",
    "a detailed study of the effects of deviations from gr in the framework of ppn formalism is in order .",
    "an analysis is already present in @xcite and the relevant parameters taken into account there have been @xmath161 ( accounting for the presence and relevance of preferred reference frames ) and @xmath12 ( accounting for the effect of spatial curvature alone ) .",
    "the possible relevance of such and other parameters must be discussed at the scale of the inner solar system .",
    "furthermore , the possible presence of galactic or even relic , gm fields must be considered and modeled in order to provide appropriate templates for the interpretation of the results .",
    "4 .   being the positioning at the lagrange points crucial , it is of paramount importance to study the orbits of the spacecraft of the experiment around those points and the related dynamics and stability .",
    "libration movements are expected in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the orbits can be stable , whereas weakly unstable lissajous orbits are typical of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( saddle points of the effective potential ) .",
    "stabilization strategies must be envisaged .",
    "one should also account for the proper motion of the lagrange points with respect to the earth , due to the eccentricity of the orbit of our planet .",
    "a model must be worked out accounting for the effects of the movements of the stations , according to point 4 , on the final evaluation of the time of flight difference along closed paths among the lagrange points .",
    "semi - analytical investigations of the main periodic orbits around the lagrangian points @xcite provide accurate approximations to model distance variations .",
    "they can also be used as seeds for numerical surveys of the unstable dynamics around @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as previously noted , the close links between scientific analysis and the corresponding technological aspects required to achieve the scientific objectives already emerge in the description of the above points .      the technological aspects to consider are several and have to be all tackled in order to ensure the realization of the proposed time - of - flight measurements .",
    "in particular , the measurement of the time - of - flight difference within a closed path and with the required precision represents , among all the aspects to consider , the most challenging one .    as seen in previous section [ subsec : polygon ] , the interval between the arrivals of the clock- and respectively counterclock - wise pulses is in the order of @xmath162 s ( in the best case @xmath163 s ) . in order to attain a 1% accuracy the clock ( and the measurement process )",
    "must have a sensitivity of at least @xmath164 s. this is not a problem in terrestrial laboratories , where one can achieve results one or two orders of magnitude better than that , depending on the integration time .",
    "of course , one may consider the possibility to repeat more than once the closed path .",
    "this will facilitate the measurement of the time difference , but will impose a more stringent requirement on the clock stability .",
    "therefore , a balance is at the end necessary for these two aspects .",
    "each spacecraft will have to be equipped with a receiver / transmitter device , or transponder , in order to allow an electromagnetic signal to travel along the closed circuit formed by the lagrangian points .",
    "of course , deep space antennas ( dsa ) will play a fundamental role in all phases of the mission , from launch to the cruise phase of each spacecraft , to their orbit insertion in the proximity of a lagrangian point and , finally , during the time measurements in the operative phase of the mission ( see for instance @xcite ) .    for what concerns the capability to reach the lagrangian points , this is not a huge problem , especially in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and also in the case of the most far away @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but reaching @xmath5 and placing in its surroundings a spacecraft would be quite challenging , because of the shielding effect by the sun , and this is the reason why we let it aside from the beginning .",
    "the main in - orbit station should be probably located in the spacecraft orbiting @xmath1 .",
    "this for the ease of communications with earth and its shielding of the perturbing solar radiation .",
    "we list below the first requirements that , from the technological point of view , we need to investigate carefully by means of dedicated studies .    1 .   the core measurement of lagrange concerns time .",
    "the main problem is to think of atomic clocks in space , onboard an observatory located in one of the lagrange points ( such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , endowed with the required accuracy and a stability sufficient for a long mission ( not less than months ) .",
    "a possible solution in order to ensure the best accuracy , and for the longest time , would be to permanently keep ( and for all configurations ) an earth laboratory as hub of our experimental polygonal network . in any case , the need for having and controlling clocks and oscillators in space can not be dispensed of completely , so that the problem must be carefully studied .",
    "2 .   the main station must be equipped also with an appropriate elaboration capacity .",
    "even though the requirement there is not much stringent : the algorithm to be used , in the case of rps , is linear . more important is the onboard data storage capacity , connected with an effective communication channel for transferring information to the earth .",
    "3 .   the technology of the transponders to be used at the other ( with respect to the main one ) stations has to be analysed carefully .",
    "each transponder is expected to work as much as possible like a mirror , with a fixed and as short as possible delay between the arrival and the bounce back of the incoming pulses .",
    "4 .   in case of the use of lagrange as a base for positioning and navigation in the solar system , each lagrange point must host an emitter of regular pulses , possibly combined with the transponder .",
    "each emitter needs to be controlled by an atomic clock ; the main constraints are not on the frequency ( ghz or even mhz repetition times for the pulses are sufficient ) , but rather on the stability over months or even years , if the rps has to be considered as a permanent equipment for navigation . 5",
    "special attention must be paid to the design of all antennas installed onboard .",
    "all electronic equipment , at all stations , of course needs an appropriate power supply , whose main components are solar cells and storage capacity .    these , and other , engineering aspects will be considered in the near future in parallel with the previous scientific requirements .",
    "after the review presented in the previous section , our conclusion can be very short .",
    "we have discussed the numerous and relevant possibilities for science , which could be implemented setting up a physical reference frame based on the lagrange points of the sun - earth system .",
    "we have concentrated our attention on the information that could be extracted from time of flight measurements of electromagnetic signals exchanged between the stations located at the l - points , christening lagrange the corresponding proposal . among others ,",
    "we have analyzed in some detail two scientific and one practical usages of lagrange : accurate determination of the gravitational time delay in the propagation of the signals , with the purpose to ameliorate the evaluation of the ppn @xmath12 parameter ; measurement of the solar lense - thirring effect and possibly of a galactic gravito - magnetic field ; establishing of a relativistic positioning and navigation system in the solar system . among the interesting information that could be retrieved from the measurement we have included new constraints on the quadrupole moment , @xmath31 , both of the earth and the sun .",
    "the preliminary analysis puts these goals within the range of feasibility , posing , in the same time , important challenges for data analysis techniques and hard technologies to be deployed in space .",
    "starting from eq . ( [ line0 ] )",
    "we apply a rotation by an angle @xmath165 , where @xmath73 is given by the first equation of the ( [ kepler ] ) . using the angular coordinate",
    "@xmath166 the line element assumes the new form : @xmath167 the next step is to apply a boost at the keplerian speed @xmath74 written in the second of the eq.s ( [ kepler ] ) . both time and the azimuth are affected ;",
    "the final coordinates expressed by the boost will obey the relations : @xmath168 for the application of interest here it is @xmath79 and all terms of the line element are developed at the order of @xmath169 with the numerical values of the sun , as cited in the text .",
    "the result is indeed eq .",
