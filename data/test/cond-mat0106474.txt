    "at mesoscopic scale and at low temperature , electrons in metallic samples keep their phase coherence on a length @xmath2 which is bigger than the sample size .",
    "transport and thermodynamic properties of the system are then sensitive to interference between electronic wave functions and present spectacular signatures of this phase coherence . to study these effects",
    "the ring geometry is especially suitable . indeed in the presence of a magnetic flux",
    "@xmath3 through the ring the periodic boundary conditions for electronic wavefunctions acquire a phase factor @xmath4 with @xmath5 the flux quantum @xcite . as a result , the magnetoconductance of a phase coherent ring exhibits quantum oscillations which periodicity corresponds to one flux quantum through the area of the sample @xcite .",
    "the phase of the first harmonics of these oscillations is sample specific so that these harmonics do not survive ensemble average .",
    "in contrast the second harmonics have a contribution which resists this averaging .",
    "this results from the interference between time reversed paths around the ring ( weak localisation contribution ) .",
    "these @xmath6 periodic oscillations were observed in transport measurements on long cylinders or connected arrays of rings @xcite .",
    "their sign corresponds to a positive magnetoconductance in zero field . in the case of singly connected geometries , like full disks ,",
    "the signature of weak localization consists in a single peak of positive magnetoconductance which width corresponds to @xmath7 through the sample @xcite .",
    "magneto - transport experiments on connected systems constitute a very sensitive and powerful probe for the investigation of sample specific signatures of quantum transport .",
    "however , because of strong coupling between the system and the measuring device , quantum corrections represent a small fraction of the conductance ( of the order of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dimensionless conductance expressed in @xmath10 units ) which is still dominated by the classical drude response in the diffusive regime @xmath11 .",
    "there exists a number of experiments which can address some of the electronic properties of mesoscopic samples without coupling to macroscopic wires .",
    "this is the case of ac conductance experiments where aharonov bohm rings are coupled to an electromagnetic field . in contrast with the connected case , the response of an isolated system can be dominated by quantum effects .",
    "moreover , the quasi discrete nature of the energy spectrum and the sensitivity to the statistical ensemble ( canonical or grand - canonical ) are new features of isolated mesoscopic systems . in particular it has been emphasized that the average absorbtion of isolated mesoscopic systems is determined by the energy level statistics and its sensitivity to time reversal symmetry breaking by a magnetic field .",
    "the first experiments done in this spirit were performed by coupling an array of disconnected gaas / gaalas rings to a strip - line superconducting resonator @xcite . in such a geometry",
    "the rings experience both ac magnetic and electric field .",
    "the magnetic response of the rings i.e. their orbital magnetism is directly related to persistent currents in the zero frequency limit @xcite . on the other hand the electric response of isolated metallic sample is related to the screening of the electric field inside the metal .",
    "the induced charge displacement is at the origin of the polarisability @xmath12 , defined as the ratio between the induced electric dipole @xmath13 and the applied electric field @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the polarisability is known to be essentially determined by the geometry of the sample with correction of the order of @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the screening length and @xmath18 the typical size of the system @xcite .",
    "it has been recently predicted that this quantity is sensitive to phase coherence around the ring @xcite and is thus expected to present flux oscillations .",
    "the electric contribution can be in the particular case of gaas rings of the same order of magnitude as the magnetic response @xcite .    to be able to distinguish between the two types of response we have designed a superconducting lc resonator which capacitive part and inductive part are physically separated . in this paper",
    "we present measurements of both magnetic and electric response of aharonov - bohm rings .",
    "note that these experiments are done on the very same array of rings for both types of response , giving us the opportunity to compare them .",
    "preliminary account of measurement of the electric response was given in reference @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way .",
    "section [ experimentalsetup ] gives a detailed presentation of the sample , an array of aharonov - bohm rings , and the resonating technic used to measure the magnetic and electric response .",
    "results on the non - dissipative part of the flux dependent electric response are presented in section [ magnetopolarisabilty ] .",
    "a comparison with theoretical predictions is given , including frequency dependence .",
    "temperature and electronic density dependence are also investigated .",
    "the next section focuses on the dissipative part of the magnetopolarisability of the rings .",
    "theoretical results for this quantity are derived and compared to the experiment .",
    "the section [ magneticresponse ] is devoted to the measurements of the magnetic response of the same rings .",
    "despite the fact that the signal is then smaller , the magnetic response of the rings is detected and compared to predictions on averaged persistent currents .",
    "we conclude by a comparison between the magnetic and electric response .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]         we have studied the electric and magnetic susceptibilities of isolated aharonov - bohm rings . our system is an array of @xmath0 2d rings etched by reactive ion etching in a high mobility algaas / gaas heterojunction .",
    "the characteristics of these rings are given in table [ tab : characteristicsoftherings ] .",
    "they are ballistic in the transverse direction and diffusive longitudinally ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "it is important to perform a deep etching of the heterojunction ( down to gaas ) in order to minimize high frequency losses , which have been observed to be important in etched algaas . because of etching the electronic density is strongly depressed .",
    "however we are able to recover the nominal density of the heterojunction by illuminating the rings with a infrared diode placed close to the sample in the dilution refrigerator . for each illumination a current of @xmath21 is run through the diode during several minutes .",
    "measurements are done at least one hour after the illumination in order to ensure good stability of the sample .",
    "an upper value of the estimated illumination power coupled to the sample is 600 photons / s with a wavelength of 766  nm . with this setup",
    "we are thus able to perform measurements at different electronic density .",
    "the control on the density is rather qualitative because of the difficulty to calibrate the illumination procedure .",
    "we have checked the effect of illumination on a connected aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring ( figure [ fig : abillum ] ) . at zero illumination time",
    "the conductance of the ring is zero .",
    "on such a sample we can follow the ab oscillations when the resistance decreases by more than an order of magnitude with illumination . as a consequence a clear effect of illuminating the ring is to increase its conductance .",
    "the fourier transform of the resistance of the ring is shown on figure [ fig : fftabillum ] .",
    "we see for each illumination an oscillation whose periodicity is consistent with a flux quantum @xmath22 in the area of the ring .",
    "however the fourier transform shows that the peak corresponding to this periodicity changes with illumination both in shape and in amplitude .",
    "the amplitude increases with illumination due to the increase of ab oscillations . the fact that the shape , and in particular the width , of the peak changes with illumination is an indication that the width of the ring increases with illumination time . to be more precise",
    "the width of the rings is multiplied by a factor 2 between the first and last curve of figure [ fig : fftabillum ] .",
    "note that the increase of the electronic density has also been shown to induce an increase of the electronic mobility @xcite .",

    "the magnetoconductance is shown on figure [ fig : angr ] .",
    "as expected the ab effect disappears under ensemble averaging .",
    "the @xmath6 oscillations on the other hand remains on the mesh . in this case the triangular shape of the magnetoconductance is attributed to weak localisation in the wire of the mesh .",

    "the curves are shifted for clarity.,width=302 ]          to measure the electric or magnetic response of the rings we couple them to a superconducting micro - resonator and detect the changes in its properties .",
    "this resonator is made by optical lithography .",
    "it consists of a niobium strip - line deposited on a sapphire substrate .",
    "this substrate has been preferred to silicon or gaas because it induces the weakest temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and gives the best quality factor due to the quality of the niobium layer on sapphire .",
    "a schematic drawing is given in figure [ fig : resonator ] .",
    "the width of the wire constituting the resonator is 2 @xmath23 m , the thickness 1 @xmath23 m and the spacing between two adjacent wires is 4 @xmath23 m .",
    "the total length of the capacitance or the inductance is 10 or 20 cm . in this kind of resonator the inductance is physically separated from the capacitance by a distance of 300 @xmath23 m , allowing to submit the sample only to an electric field ( or to a magnetic field ) to measure its electric ( or magnetic ) response .",
    "this separation between magnetic and electric response has been checked by deposition of a paramagnetic system ( dpph ) alternatively on the capacitive and inductive part of the resonator .",
    "a magnetic spin resonance signal was only observed when dpph was on the inductive part .",
    "the resonance frequency of the bare resonator varies between 200 mhz and 400 mhz depending on the geometry .",
    "its quality factor is 10000 at 4.2 k and 200000 at 20 mk .",
    "the resonator can be modelled by an lc circuit of resistance @xmath24 , inductance @xmath25 , capacitance @xmath26 , whose resonance frequency is @xmath27 and quality factor @xmath28 . from the value of the higher resonance frequencies of the resonator",
    "we have estimated that the residual capacitance of the meander line is at least 10 times smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "due to the meissner effect , the dc field just above the resonator is strongly inhomogeneous . in order to minimize this effect ,",
    "we have inserted a thin , @xmath29m - thick , mylar film between the detector and the rings .",
    "this reduces the field inhomogeneity to about @xmath30% , which is of the order of fluctuations in the lithography .      in order to measure their electric response the rings",
    "are placed on top of the capacitance of the resonator .",
    "note that with this procedure the rings are not well aligned with the resonator so that they do not have the same coupling with the capacitance .",
    "this is not a problem as soon as only linear response is investigated .",
    "we note @xmath31 the polarisability averaged over disorder of a ring at the frequency @xmath32 .",
    "the impedance of the capacitance @xmath26 slightly modified by the rings reads  : @xmath33 in this expression @xmath34 is the number of rings coupled to the capacitance , @xmath35 is an averaged coefficient measuring the dielectric coupling between one ring and the capacitance .",
    "the capacitance with the rings is equivalent to a capacitance @xmath36 in series with a resistance @xmath37 .",
    "hence  : @xmath38 the frequency shift due to the rings is then  : @xmath39 the quality factor is determined by  : @xmath40 so that , with @xmath41 at resonance  : @xmath42 provided that @xmath43 .",
    "the electric coupling coefficient is estimated in appendix [ electric_coupling ] . knowing this value and the number of rings coupled to the resonator",
    ", it is possible to evaluate quantitatively the polarisability of the rings by measuring the resonance frequency shift ( equation [ frequencyshift ] ) and the variation of the quality factor ( equation [ qshift ] ) .",
    "when the rings are placed on top of the inductance @xmath25 of the resonator , this inductance is shifted because of their magnetic response @xmath44 according to  : @xmath45 with @xmath34 the number of rings coupled to the resonator , @xmath46 the magnetic coupling coefficient between one ring and the inductance , which has the dimension of the inverse of a volume .",
    "note that , properly defined , the coupling coefficient @xmath46 is of the same order of magnitude than @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely the estimation of @xmath35 and @xmath46 done in appendix leads to @xmath47 , as expected from reference @xcite .",
    "following the same reasoning than for the electric coupling , the properties of the resonator are modified according to  : @xmath48    from previous equations it is in principle possible to measure the absolute value of @xmath12 or @xmath49 .",
    "however when a gaas sample is on the inductive or capacitive part of the resonator the modification of the resonance is dominated by the influence of the substrate . as a consequence",
    "it is very difficult to have an accurate absolute measurement .",
    "nevertheless relative measurements are possible so that the variation of the electric or magnetic response with magnetic field can be detected in a reliable way .",
    "the reflected signal of the resonator is measured with the setup of figure [ fig : reflectedsignal ] and used in a feedback loop to lock the frequency of a rf generator to the resonance frequency .",
    "the setup is summarized in figure [ fig : asservissement ] .",
    "the resonator is coupled capacitively to the external circuit using on - chip capacitances . in order to preserve the quality factor of the resonator we work in a configuration where the resonator is undercoupled .",
    "the rf power injected is sufficiently low ( @xmath50 10 pw ) so as not to heat the sample .",
    "the frequency of the rf generator is modulated at @xmath51 and the signal from the resonator is detected by a lock - in detector at the frequency of the modulation .",
    "the lock - in signal is to first approximation the derivative of the resonance peak : it gives an error signal i.e. this signal is zero at resonance , and changes sign when the frequency of the generator is higher or lower than the resonance frequency . using this signal in a feedback loop the frequency of the rf generator",
    "is locked to the resonance frequency .",
    "this way , by measuring the feedback signal , one has directly access to the shift of the resonance frequency . to enhance the accuracy we modulate the magnetic field by a 1 g ac field oscillating at 30 hz , produced by a small superconducting coil close to the sample , and detect the modulated resonance frequency with a lock - in detector .",
    "at this point we consider that the frequency of the generator is locked to the resonance frequency by the previous setup .",
    "the signal measured is the signal reflected from the resonator . as a consequence it is related to the reflexion coefficient @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the impedance of the resonator and the coupling capacitance and @xmath54 the impedance matched by the external circuit .",
    "we assume that near the resonance frequency the impedance @xmath53 reads  : @xmath55 with @xmath56 the resonance frequency . in the limit @xmath57 , which correspond to a very undercoupled resonator ,",
    "the reflected signal is a linear function of @xmath53 . as a consequence",
    "if the rf signal is frequency modulated at @xmath51 around the resonance frequency @xmath56 the reflected signal at @xmath58 is related to the second derivative of the real part @xmath53 , which is proportional to @xmath59 . this way by measuring the signal at @xmath58 we have access to the quality factor .",
    "however when the frequency modulation is not small compared to the width of the resonance peak or the resonator is not very undercoupled to the external circuit , the relation between the signal at @xmath58 and the quality factor is not straightforward and needs calibration .",
    "in this part we present measurements of the flux dependent polarisability of the rings , which are placed on the capacitive part of the resonator as described in section [ experimentalsetup ] . in this configuration the resonance frequency is decreased by 15 % , due to the dielectric constant of the gaas substrate .",
    "moreover the quality factor drops down to 3000 at 20 mk at zero illumination .",
    "this strong decrease is attributed to dielectric losses in the heterojunction .",
    "the derivative of the resonance frequency of the resonator with the rings is shown on figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( a ) .",
    "this signal is a straight line , on top of which small oscillations are superimposed .",
    "the straight line is due to the field dependence of the penetration length in niobium , which constitutes the resonator .",
    "this behaviour has been verified to be the same with or without the rings .",
    "the oscillating signal is on the other hand attributed to the flux dependent electric response of the rings .",
    "these oscillations are extracted by subtracting the base line ( figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( b ) ) .",
    "note their anharmonicity as well as the existence of an aperiodic signal as illustrated by the fourier transform of the data ( figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( c ) ) showing a well defined peak . in order to focus on this periodic contribution , which is the expected signature of phase coherence , a numerical high pass filter with a cut - off frequency of 0.05 g@xmath60 ( corresponding to the arrow on figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( c ) )",
    "is applied and the signal is then numerically integrated in order to have the frequency shift due to the rings ( figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( d ) ) .",
    "this shift is proportional to the variation of polarisability versus magnetic field according to formula [ frequencyshift ] .",
    "we will return to the aperiodic signal in the section devoted to illumination effect .",
    "the frequency shift due to the rings is periodic with a period of approximately 12.5 g. from the fourier transform ( figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( c ) ) the period of the oscillation is deduced to be consistent with half a flux quantum @xmath61 in a ring with no signature of @xmath22 periodicity , as expected for an aharonov - bohm effect averaged over many rings @xcite .",
    "note the extra broadening ( by more than a factor 2 ) of this @xmath6 peak compared to the measurements on a single connected ring .",
    "we interpret this as resulting from the dispersion in circumfrences in the different rings .",
    "the sign of frequency shift is negative at low magnetic field which means according to formula [ frequencyshift ] that the magneto - polarisability is positive , i.e. @xmath62 at low magnetic field .",
    "the screening is thus better when time reversal symmetry is broken by magnetic field .",
    "the scale of the signal is given by the amplitude of the first oscillation .",
    "from figure [ fig : polarextract ] ( d ) we deduced @xmath63 g@xmath64 . note that this value means detecting a frequency shift of 100hz on a frequency of 350 mhz . with the coupling coefficient estimated in appendix [ electric_coupling ] it leads to the value of the magnetopolarisability @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the calculated polarisability of a quasi one dimensional ( quasi-1d ) circular ring of radius @xmath67 .       at different value of the parameter @xmath68 . note that the value of magnetopolarisability is zero at zero whatever the level broadening.,width=298 ]",
    "our experiment shows that there is a flux correction to the polarisability of the rings , which is _ positive _ at low field .",
    "let s now compare this result to recent theoretical predictions . since we are using a ring geometry we are going alternatively from a situation where the system presents time reversal symmetry ( at flux values of @xmath69 , with @xmath70 ) to the case where time reversal symmetry is broken by magnetic field .",
    "in the random matrix theory ( rmt ) the first case corresponds to gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) whereas the second is related to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "so the quantity to be compared with theoretical predictions , which evaluate the variation of a physical variable @xmath71 between goe and gue , is @xmath72 defined as @xmath73 .",
    "note that since the rings are semi - ballistic , the transition with magnetic field may not be exactly from goe to gue .",
    "the polarisability of small metallic grains was studied using rmt first by gorkov and eliashberg @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the electrostatic properties of mesoscopic systems to quantum coherence has been emphasized by bttiker for connected geometries @xcite .",
    "the phase coherent correction to the polarisability of isolated systems was recently theoretically investigated .",
    "efetov found that it is possible to relate self consistently this correction to the flux dependence of the screened potential @xcite .",
    "two recent works have calculated this effect in the diffusive regime using linear response formalism ( noat _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) or supersymmetry techniques ( blanter and mirlin @xcite ) .    in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce )",
    "the chemical potential in each ring is supposed to be constant .",
    "it describes a situation where the rings are connected to a reservoir of particules . _ a priori _ this is not the case in the experiment where the rings are isolated but as the theory is simpler in gce we recall first the result in this statistical ensemble .",
    "no flux dependence for the polarisability is predicted if the rf pulsation @xmath32 is much smaller than the inverse relaxation time @xmath74 .",
    "however when @xmath75 the magnetopolarisability is related to the flux dependence of the diagonal matrix element of the screened potential  : @xmath76 @xmath77 is the disorder averaged square of the diagonal matrix element of the screened potential @xmath78 at energy @xmath23 , the mean chemical potential of the rings .",
    "@xmath79 is the applied electric field .",
    "we note @xmath80 the eigenstates of the unperturbed system .",
    "this matrix element is then given by  : @xmath81 from this expression it appears that the magnetopolarisability is related to the difference of correlation function of the eigenstates with and without time reversal symmetry .",
    "this correlation function has been computed in the diffusive regime within a supersymetric @xmath82-model approach @xcite  : @xmath83 \\left [ 1 + 2 \\pi_d({\\bf r_1},{\\bf r_2 } ) \\right ] \\quad ( goe)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath84 \\left [ 1 + \\pi_d({\\bf r_1},{\\bf r_2 } ) \\right ] \\quad ( gue)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath85 the volume of the sample , @xmath86 a short range function which decays on the length scale of the mean free path and @xmath87 the diffusion propagator .",

    "note that the measurement is not sufficiently accurate to give an estimate of the level broadening by comparing the experimental result with the curves of figure [ fig : polarce ] .",

    "it yields figure [ fig : effetillum ] , which shows the change of the amplitude of the magnetopolarisability . at first the signal increases , then for illumination time above 1400 s the amplitude of oscillation decreases .",
    "we interpret this behaviour in the following way . before illumination",
    "the electronic density in the rings obtained after deep etching of the 2deg is strongly depressed compared to the nominal value . as a consequence an important fraction of the rings are likely to be localized and do not contribute to the magnetopolarisability . in this regime",

    "after illumination the number of rings contributing to the signal increases so that the frequency shift due to the rings increases . at high enough electronic density",
    "when the rings are sufficiently populated so that they contain delocalized electrons the theoretical results obtained in the diffusive regime are expected to be valid leading to a @xmath8 dependence ( formula [ da ] ) , with @xmath114 the dimensionless conductance . this is a possible explanation for the decrease of the magnetopolarisability observed at high illumination level .",
    "note that we can not exclude also a reduction of the screening length @xmath17 due to illumination . from formula [ da ]",
    "we deduce then a decrease of the signal .",

    "the electric absorption is always negative at low frequency and may change sign at low value of @xmath68 .    in order to compare these calculations with our experimental result we will compute the ratio @xmath135 .",
    "it is worth noting that in our experiment this quantity is given according to equations ( [ frequencyshift],[qshift ] ) by @xmath136 and is independent of the number of rings coupled to the resonator or the electric coupling coefficient @xmath35 .",

    "the predicted behaviour is consistent with the experimental value for the sign , but the theoretical amplitude is too high by more than a factor 2 .",

    "note that to do so we have to warm - up , cool down and re - illuminate the rings . as a consequence , strictly speaking , the rings are not the same than for the measurement of the electrical response because the electronic density and the disorder realisation in each ring is not exactly the same from one run to the other .",
    "nevertheless due to the fact that we are measuring an ensemble average quantity the change in disorder realisation of each ring does not modify the result of the experiment .",
    "moreover we have checked ( on the electric response measurement ) that , for the same illumination procedure , the result varies within a 15 % range from one run to the other .",

    "however due to the small value of the residual capacitance of the meander line and the bad electric coupling in this geometry this electric component is estimated to be at least 20 times smaller than when the rings are placed on top of the capacitance .",
    "moreover the very different shape of the electric and magnetic signals is a strong evidence that we are indeed measuring essentially the magnetic response of the rings .",
    "the signal measured at zero illumination , after subtracting the base line due to the resonator , is shown in the lower part of figure [ fig : magneticsignal ] .",
    "inspired by our previous analysis we decompose the measured field dependent part of the signal into an aperiodic and a periodic part which corresponds to @xmath6 in a ring ( figure [ fig : magneticsignal ] ) .",
    "we interpret the @xmath6 component as the contribution of electronic trajectories enclosing the whole ring . on the other hand the triangular shape signal",
    "could be due to the contribution of trajectories confined in the finite width of the ring .",

    "considering on the other hand theoretical predictions for non interacting electrons @xcite the expected value is between @xmath150 na and @xmath151 na . in both cases the currents are predicted to be paramagnetic .",
    "the rather small difference between interacting and non interacting electrons is very specific to the gaas rings where the number of electrons is small .",
    "the measured signal is consistent for the amplitude but not for the sign ( unless assuming attractive interactions ) with theoretical predictions .",
    "it may also be important to take into account an effect of frequency for the flux dependent orbital magnetism .",
    "in fact by applying a formalism very similar to the one used for magnetopolarisability the variation of the real part ( non - dissipative ) of the susceptibility of a ring submitted to an oscillating magnetic flux in ce without interactions is given by @xcite  : @xmath152 with @xmath153 the matrix element of the current operator .",

    "note that in strong contrast with the electric response the magnetic susceptibility is maximum at zero frequency , which corresponds to persistent currents .",
    "it would be important to investigate the effect of finite frequency on the contribution due to electron - electron interactions on persistent currents .",
    "recently it has been suggested that the measured currents may be due to a rectifying behaviour of the rings : a high frequency noise leads then to a dc current @xcite .",
    "noise also induces dephasing .",
    "a recent paper by kravtsov and altshuler @xcite predicts that those two quantities , average persistent current and dephasing measured by the saturation of the phase coherence time , are related in a simple way @xmath158 .",

    "the predicted persistent current is then _",
    "diamagnetic_. the sign and amplitude are then consistent with our experimental findings . on the other hand if we take the value deduced from the temperature dependance of the magnetopolarisability of non - connected rings , which is not the case considered theoretically , we deduce @xmath163 na , smaller by an order of magnitude than the experimental value",
    ".      the influence of electronic density on the magnetic response of the rings has been investigated by illuminating them .",
    "different illumination times are shown in figure [ fig : magneticillum ] .",
    "we observed that the triangular envelope of the signal changes sign and increases with illumination . for each illumination",
    "the fourier transform of the signal exhibits a component which is consistent with half a flux quantum periodicity ( figure [ fig : magneticillumfft ] ) .",
    "one sees however that with illumination the shape of the @xmath6 peak in the fourier transform is modified .",
    "the peak broadens with electronic density indicating that the width of the rings increases .",
    "note that this width is always consistent with the one deduced from etching and depletion effects .",
    "the power of the fourier transform integrated in the @xmath6 zone is constant within 10 % .",
    "so the amplitude of the @xmath6 signal is constant but its shape is modified .",
    "it indicates that the amplitude of the persistent currents does not depend much on electronic density .",
    "the sign change of the low frequency part of the flux dependent magnetic response of the rings , going from low field paramagnetism to diamagnetism , is not understood .",
    "we have presented measurements of electric and magnetic responses of aharonov - bohm rings etched in a 2deg .",
    "they present a flux dependent correction to screening .",
    "this correction is positive in low field which means that screening is enhanced when time reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic field .",
    "the sign of the effect is consistent with theory for isolated rings at finite frequency .",
    "the value of magnetopolarisability is @xmath164 , with @xmath165 the calculated polarisability of a quasi-1d circular ring of radius r. the temperature dependence of magnetopolarisability is consistent with @xmath166 .",
    "the behaviour versus electronic density is compatible with a @xmath8 dependence of magnetopolarisability .",
    "the magnetic response has been measured on the very same array of rings .",
    "the rings exhibits a signal consistent with _",
    "diamagnetic _ average persistent currents of amplitude @xmath167 na .    because the measurements are done on the same rings it is possible to compare the electric and the magnetic signal .",
    "the experimental ratio between the frequency shift due to the electric or magnetic response is around 10 , a value consistent with theoretical expectations taking into account the electric and magnetic coupling coefficient ( appendix [ magnetic_coupling ] and [ electric_coupling ] ) and the ratio between the typical matrix element of the screened potential and the current operator which leads to @xcite : @xmath168 with @xmath169 the vacuum impedance , @xmath170 the drude conductance and @xmath171 the fine structure constant .",
    "we have thus shown that the mesoscopic electromagnetic response of gaas rings is dominated by the flux dependent polarisability instead of orbital magnetism .",
    "this would not be the case in metallic rings , where , due to the very short screening length , the mesoscopic electric response is negligible .",
