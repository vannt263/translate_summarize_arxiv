    "the passage of a high energy charged particle through matter is an interesting source of electromagnetic nuclear reactions largely occurring at very small angles .",
    "one can view such processes as produced by the flux of a beam of nearly real equivalent photons @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . though these photons are virtual , their kinematics at small angles of deviation of the charged particle is so close to that of real photons that it becomes a good approximation to link the inelastic cross sections for charged particles to the ones for physical photons with an energy equal to the energy loss .",
    "the nuclear reactions induced by the small angle scattering of charged particles are of particular importance to the low count rate underground experiments , such as searches for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the reason is that cosmic ray muons traverse the experimental area and their energy loss produces background neutrons and pions .",
    "it is by no means a trivial matter to obtain reliable estimates for actual yields of neutrons and pions .",
    "the problem is related both to the question of obtaining a sufficiently reliable estimate for the equivalent photon flux as well as to the problem of finding appropriate input data .",
    "this is the aim of the present investigation which has been stimulated by the rate of low - energy neutrons observed in an exploration of background sources in a planned neutrino oscillation experiment . as a quick estimate has shown , the neutron yield from the low - energy photo - nuclear giant - resonance excitation , as considered e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , is much too small to explain the observations , which suggests rather that meson - producing processes are primarily responsible . indeed , negative pions are an efficient source of neutrons since most of them will slow down and stop in the surrounding matter .",
    "they are then captured into orbits of pionic atoms and produce neutron pairs by the quasi - deuteron absorption process @xmath1 on the central nucleus .",
    "the observation of correlated neutrons is therefore linked to the yield of negative pions . to confirm this mechanism for neutron production we advocated a study of the yield of charged pions .",
    "negative pions are not directly observable , but positive pions are produced at nearly the same rate .",
    "their presence would be an indication in favor of this mechanism .",
    "the yield of positive pions has since been directly established experimentally from the observation of the delayed muon decay from the @xmath2 stopping without strong interactions @xcite .    for photons above 300 mev",
    "an efficient way to produce pions is via the @xmath0 isobar , which appears as a prominent peak in the photo - absorption cross sections . in view of the importance of the isobar region",
    "it is interesting to explore the validity of various approximations to the flux of equivalent photons there . in this case",
    "the isobar excitation by muons can be calculated without resorting to the equivalent photon method , and compared to the equivalent photon method in various limits as is done in section 2.2 , which follow the framework given in section 2.1 .",
    "this provides a guide for the application of this method at higher energies . in section 3",
    "we evaluate the @xmath2 production yield by high energy muons utilizing the equivalent photon method .",
    "for this we need the photon partial cross sections for a given multiplicity of @xmath2 which , in turn , leads to the discussion of the assumptions necessary to deduce the yield of positive pions from experimental data .",
    "the somewhat unexpected result of this study is that pions are produced primarily above the @xmath0 isobar region , often by multiple pion production .",

    "( [ eq : ngamma ] ) from our calculated muon and photon cross sections is an exact one within the model .",
    "it can be compared with various approximations given by dalitz and yennie , in particular eq .",
    "( [ eq : dy17 ] ) obtained under the assumption of a momentum independent transverse response .",
    "this expression which is a function of the energy has to be evaluated at the excitation energy @xmath90 of the @xmath0 isobar by photons .",

    "surprisingly the agreement between our exact photon number and the one given by the dalitz - yennie formula  ( [ eq : dy17 ] ) is excellent , well beyond what is expected from the @xmath22 dependence of the response . in order to elucidate the origin of this intriguing agreement we have proceeded in several steps .",
    "first , we have suppressed one obvious source of @xmath22 dependence of the response in our calculation , namely that of the magnetic form factor that we now take to be constant .",
    "as shown in table [ tab .",
    "2 ] , this has a sizable effect since this suppression increases the muon cross section by about 30 - 40 % , destroying the previous agreement .",

    "the reason is that the response is not only proportional to @xmath93 , but there are additional sources of momentum dependence , as seen in the second form of the response , eq .",
    "( [ rdelta2 ] ) .",

    "( [ rdelta2 ] ) , which acts as a form factor .",
    "both have the effect of reducing the muon cross section by sizable amounts .",
    "therefore , the expression  ( [ eq : dy18 ] ) , which in principle should be more appropriate for a magnetic transition , is in fact a poor approximation .",
    "( [ eq : dy17 ] ) ( the dalitz - yennie standard value ) , which assumes a constant response , agrees much better with our result , in particular with the one where the variation of the form factor is kept .",
    "the reason is that the decrease of the form factor cuts off the large momenta and makes the assumption of a constant response better which leads to the agreement with formula  ( [ eq : dy17 ] ) .",
    "we have checked this by exploring the influence of the form factor on the constant term @xmath94 of the response in eq .",

    "2 ] with a constant response .",
    "while the form factor influence is only moderate on the first part , it is quite large in the @xmath22-term , which is strongly suppressed .",
    "this makes the approximation of a constant response a valid one . a good agreement between our value and the formula ( [ eq : dy17 ] ) is therefore understandable , although such a perfect one is a coincidence depending on the exact value of the cut - off parameter .",
    "this is illustrated by line d ) in table  [ tab .",
    "2 ] where we have used a larger value @xmath95  . the agreement remains good although not quite perfect .",
    "it is difficult to prove the general validity of the dalitz - yennie formula for other production mechanisms .",
    "consequently , one can not give a universal expression for the equivalent photon number , which allows the derivation of the muon cross section from the photon one with good accuracy . in the absence of this universal relation and in view of the good agreement provided by the expression ( 1.7 ) of ref.@xcite",
    "we have thus used it at all energies and , in particular , also in the multipion range .",
    "the accuracy of such an approximation is obviously difficult to assess .",

    "we have made the estimate with a fermi momentum of 230 mev / c , which is a characteristic value for a light nucleus like carbon and using the analytic expressions for the response of a fermi gas given in ref .",
    "the resulting effect of fermi motion on the average photon number @xmath108 is unimportant at lower lepton energies , and it represents only a 2.5 % effect at 15 gev .",

    "the reaction cross section in a given exit channel , averaged over the muon spectrum at a given depth @xmath110 is obtained by analogy to eq.([eq : numphot ] ) , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the branching ratio for the corresponding reaction channel , e.g. @xmath128 , @xmath129 , etc ..

    "thus , the yields obtained with eq.([eq : numeff ] ) are really lower limits for the neutron production . in order to apply the formalism we have to substitute in eq.([eq : numeff ] ) the corresponding experimental photo - nuclear cross sections , and branching ratios .",
    "the total photo - absorption cross section which we used is shown in fig.[fig : photo ] .",
    "since the @xmath128 reaction is the only reaction channel of interest for photon energies below the pion production threshold , we use this partial cross section at these energies , and the full cross section above it .",

    "the data are smoothed at higher energies and extrapolated at very high energies .",
    "we first consider the pion production , which can be evaluated more reliably .",
    "for this we require the branching ratio @xmath127 for @xmath2 and @xmath130 in the @xmath0 resonance region @xmath107 = 160 - 500 mev , and in the higher energy region above . in the high energy region",
    "the analysis is simplified by the empirical observation that the photo - cross section of @xmath2 and @xmath130 on a proton is nearly the same as the corresponding one on a neutron with the opposite charges for the pions .",
    "for example , the cross section for the reaction @xmath131 is approximately equal to the cross section for @xmath132 , and similarly for @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "this means that we do not need all partial cross sections , and in particular , that for a carbon target the number of @xmath2 produced is the same one as the number of @xmath130 .",
    "since for photon energies above 1 gev multipion production becomes important , the proper definition of the branching ratio @xmath127 for pions is @xmath135 the @xmath130 production has the same branching ratio in carbon , as we just pointed out above .    for photon energies below 1 gev",

    "the corresponding branching ratio appears to be , however , a smooth and relatively slowly increasing function of energy .",
    "thus we interpolated between the known points . finally , to extend to even higher photon energies we extrapolated this smooth trend linearly in the logarithm of the photon energy .",
    "it is encouraging to note that such an extrapolation leads to an average @xmath2 multiplicity of about 2.5 at the photon energy of 100 gev , in a good agreement with the measurement of enikeev et al .",
    "@xcite for the electromagnetic showers of similar energy ( note , however , that our slope of multiplicity versus energy is less than the one measured in ref .",
    "@xcite at considerably higher energies 100 - 1000 gev ) .    having determined the branching ratio @xmath127 for the nucleon targets , we assume that in nuclear targets ( in our case in carbon ) the same @xmath127 is applicable .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath137 is obtained by multiplying @xmath127 for nucleons by the total photo - absorption cross section for carbon .",
    "the dashed curve in fig . [ fig : photo ] shows this @xmath137 .",
    "the rather uncertain cross sections and branching ratios at the highest energies are , fortunately , not very important for our final results at shallow depths .",
    "this uncertainty , however , prevents us from extending the calculations to deeper sites .",
    "it is now a simple matter to evaluate the @xmath2 production yield by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : numeff ] ) over the virtual photon energy @xmath107 .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : pion ] .",
    "we divide there the contributions to the integral into three energy bins .",
    "column 2 demonstrates that the @xmath0 resonance contributes relatively little , even at very shallow depths . for @xmath110 = 20 and 100 meters",
    "the bulk of the contribution comes from the region below 10 gev ( column 3 ) , where the multiplicities and cross sections are reasonably well known . for the largest depth , ( @xmath138 m )",
    "there is a large contribution from photons of 10 - 100 gev and contributions from energies beyond 100 gev , which are not included , will increase the total cross section even further .",
    "since we want to compare our calculated pion yield with the measured one in a liquid scintillator , we have to take into account the large hydrogen component of the scintillator ( h / c ratio of 1.89 ) . the calculation of the pion yield from the muon scattering on protons proceeds in a complete analogy with the calculation for carbon described above .",
    "the cross sections and branching ratios are taken from ref.@xcite . and",
    "the resulting pion yields are quoted in table [ tab : pion ] ( the entries in parentheses ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : pion ] we express the @xmath2 yield in the units in which it is usually measured , i.e. , the number of particles per muon and per ( g @xmath139 ) . to transform the cross section into such units we have to multiply it by the number of carbon nuclei per gram of scintillator , @xmath140 g@xmath12 , and analogously by the number of hydrogen nuclei per gram , @xmath141 .",
    "it is very encouraging to note that our total yield ( i. e. adding the carbon and hydrogen contributions ) is @xmath142 at @xmath110 = 20 m in agreement within errors with the yield @xmath143 measured at that depth in ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to our calculation",
    "the pion yield should increase by a factor of three when going from @xmath110 = 20 m to 500 m. the depth dependence has not been measured for pion production and would constitute a test of the validity of our approach .",
    "the analogous calculation for the total yield of neutrons is much more problematic , in particular at deeper depths corresponding to high energy photons .",
    "the reason is the importance of neutron production by secondary spallation processes .",
    "we do not treat the secondary processes here , but we comment below on a possible more complete treatment of the neutron production .",
    "first however , since the global neutron yield is of considerable practical importance to underground physics and some data exist@xcite , we give here a crude estimate recalling that the pion production region , in particular at higher energy , is the most important one .",
    "a lower estimate is obtained by using the following assumptions ( all assuming a carbon target ) : a ) in the giant - resonance region region we use the experimental @xmath144 cross section ) ; b ) in the quasi - deuteron region up to the pion threshold we take the branching ratio to be unity , since mostly both a neutron and a proton are emitted simultaneously ; c ) in the region of pion production we assume that by quasi - free processes there is always a primary branching ratio of 1/2 for neutron emission ( equal number of neutrons and protons ) , while secondary absorption of negative pions give an additional branching ratio of @xmath145 , since stopping @xmath130 gives a neutron pair in 80% and a neutron - proton pair in 20% of the cases .",
    "that is almost certainly an underestimate , particularly for large energy transfers @xmath107 for which a large number of hadrons are emitted in the reaction .",
    "our corresponding results for the neutron production underground are summarized in table [ tab : neutron ] , again divided into energy transfer bins of obvious physical significance . even at very shallow depths",
    "the giant - resonance and quasi - deuteron regions contribute relatively little .",
    "as was the case of pion production , the asymptotic region , with its large uncertainty , appears not to be crucial for shallow depths ( @xmath146 100 m ) , but it gives a very significant fraction at deeper sites .",
    "as far as comparison with the experiment is concerned two comments can be made . at @xmath110",
    "= 20 m in ref .",
    "@xcite two values are quoted .",
    "the total neutron yield is ( 4@xmath147 per muon and per ( g @xmath139 ) .",
    "however , when the shower component ( possibly originating from outside the detector ) is eliminated , the neutron yield associated with muons alone is about 2 in the same units ( and presumably with a similar error bar @xmath148 as above ) .",
    "thus , our calculated number of 0.87 underestimates the neutron production by a factor of two to four , indicating that secondary neutron production other than by pion capture is non - negligible even at such a shallow depth .    the depth dependence , as quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests a fivefold increase at @xmath149 m with a yield of about @xmath150 per muon and per ( g @xmath151 .",
    "our calculation therefore seriously underestimates the neutron yield at that depth , suggesting that secondary neutron production becomes crucial .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to describe the secondary neutron production , and therefore the total neutron yields , quantitatively .",
    "we can , however , present some qualitative arguments . for bulk targets of heavy elements , the neutron multiplicities for hadron - induced processes at",
    "high energies increase linearly with the incident energy @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that this linearity holds also for light elements .",
    "since photons of energy larger than a few gev have characteristic features of hadronic interactions ( vector meson dominance ) we may suppose that this linearity applies also in this case .",
    "we then apply this statement to the rather light elements of the detector of ref .",
    "@xcite for the part of the photon spectrum above a certain energy @xmath152 . below this energy",
    "we keep the previous approach , in which the secondaries only come from pions . within this framework",
    "we can determine the unknown proportionality constant between the neutron multiplicity and the energy by fitting the data on neutron production .",
    "this requires a multiplicity of 4 to 5 neutrons per gev of photon energy above the energy @xmath152 at which we assume the hadronic approximation to set in .",
    "the first ( second ) number corresponds to the value of @xmath152 of 2 ( 10 ) gev .",
    "our considerations , besides giving a lower limit for the neutron yield , offer a hint of the scenario which might emerge from such a description .",
    "in summary we have investigated the production of positive pions and neutrons by cosmic muons at underground sites of various depths .",
    "we have used the equivalent photon method , the validity of which we have tested in the case of a @xmath0 isobaric model .",
    "we have made an exact evaluation of both the muon and photon cross sections in the framework of a specific model for @xmath0 excitation .",
    "we have found that the equivalent photon method with a dalitz - yennie formula for the photon number reproduces remarkably well the theoretical cross section for the @xmath0 excitation by muons , when the momentum dependence of the transverse response is neglected as well as the longitudinal response .",
    "this agreement is somewhat unexpected because of the momentum dependence of a response of magnetic type .",
    "our investigation shows that the agreement is to a large part due to the effect of the form factors which cut - off the large momenta .",
    "this success has lead us to apply the dalitz - yennie formula ( [ eq : dy17 ] ) also in the region of the response where it has not been tested .",
    "we have then used the method to evaluate the production of positive pions in liquid scintillator from known photo - absorption cross sections .",
    "this estimate requires the knowledge of the branching ratio of the pion channel including the multiplicity .",
    "we find that at a depth of 20 meters our estimate reproduces the measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as for the neutron production",
    ", we have shown that the low - energy mechanisms ( giant - dipole excitation , quasi - deuteron production ) are unimportant .",
    "neutrons associated with pions appear to be the dominant source .",
    "however , using the information from the neutron production in direct processes together with neutrons produced from the absorption of stopped negative pions , our conservative estimates underpredict the experimentally observed neutron yield .",
    "this indicates that there is considerable secondary neutron production in the target environment .",
    "the quantitative description of such nuclear cascades is a formidable problem .",
    "therefore , the direct pion production is a much better test of our understanding of cosmic muon interactions , while the total neutron yield has a direct practical interest as a source of background at underground sites .",
