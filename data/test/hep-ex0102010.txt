    "the fermilab tevatron collider is currently between data runs .",
    "the period from 1992 - 1996 , known as tevatron run  1 , saw both the cdf and d  experiments accumulate approximately @xmath5 of integrated luminosity .",
    "these data sets have yielded a large number of results and publications on topics ranging from the discovery of the top quark to precise measurements of the mass of the @xmath1 boson ; from measurements of jet production at the highest energies ever observed to searches for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this talk and subsequent paper focus on two aspects of the tevatron program : electroweak physics and the physics of hadrons containing the bottom quark .",
    "each of these topics is quite rich in its own right .",
    "it is not possible to do justice to either these topics in the space provided .",
    "also , there are a large number of sources for summaries of recent results . for example , many conference proceedings and summaries are easily accessible to determine the most up - to - date measurements of the mass of the @xmath1 boson . instead of trying to summarize a boat - load of tevatron measurements here , i will attempt to describe a few measurements in an introductory manner .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explain some of the methods and considerations for these measurements .",
    "this paper therefore is geared more towards students and non - experts .",
    "the goal here is not to comprehensively present the results , but to discuss how the results are obtained and what the important elements are in these measurements .    after a brief discussion of the tevatron collider and the two collider experiments",
    ", we will discuss electroweak and @xmath0 physics at the tevatron .",
    "the fermilab tevatron collides protons(@xmath6 ) and antiprotons ( @xmath7 ) at very high energy . in past",
    "runs , the @xmath8 center of mass energy was @xmath9 .",
    "it will be increased in the future to @xmath10 .. running the machine at slightly below @xmath11 drastically improves the reliability of the superconducting magnets . ]",
    "until the large hadron collider begins operation at cern late in this decade , the tevatron will be the highest energy accelerator in the world .",
    "the high energy , combined with a very high interaction rate , provides many opportunities for unique and interesting measurements .",
    ".some highlights in the history of the fermilab tevatron .",
    "this table lists primarily milestones associated with the collider program . in addition , there have been several tevatron fixed - target runs , producing a wealth of physics results .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     with the sample of events , the proper decay time and the measured flavor for each event , we are ready to proceed . in practice",
    ", we are measuring @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14(@xmath15 ) are the number of negative ( positive ) tags .",
    "a negative tag indicates a @xmath16 , while a positive tag indicates a @xmath17 .",
    "we do not write @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the equation , though , because not every negative tag is truly a @xmath16 .",
    "we arrive at the quantity @xmath18 using the @xmath19 data , but to get to the measured asymmetry , we must also know @xmath20 .",
    "we can measure @xmath20 using control samples and monte carlo , but it can not be extracted from the @xmath19 data . since typical dilutions are about @xmath21 , that means that the raw asymmetry is 1/5 the size of the measured asymmetry . the higher the dilution ( the more effective the flavor tagging method ) the closer the raw asymmetry is to the measured asymmetry . we can classify the statistical uncertainty on the asymmetry as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is",
    "the uncertainty on the dilution and @xmath24 is the statistical uncertainty on the raw asymmetry . ignoring ( for the moment ) the presence of background in our sample , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the flavor tagging efficiency discussed previously and @xmath27 is the number of signal events .",
    "more realistically , we can not neglect the presence of background , and the statistical uncertainty on the measured asymmetry is : @xmath28 . the first term in equation [ eq : da ] is the `` statistical '' uncertainty on the asymmetry and is of the form : @xmath29 .",
    "not only does the dilution factor degrade the raw asymmetry , it also inflates the statistical error .",
    "think of it this way : we have events that we are putting into two bins  a @xmath17 bin and a @xmath16 bin .",
    "when we tag an event incorrectly ( mistag ) , we take it out of one bin and put it into the other bin",
    ". not only do we have one less event in the correct bin , we have one more event in the incorrect bin ! this hurts our measurement more than had we simply removed the event from the correct bin and thrown it away .",
    "in reality , there are several complications to this measurement :    * our data sample has both signal and background events in it .",
    "for an event in the signal region , we do nt know _ a priori if it is signal or background .",
    "_ * we are using multiple flavor tagging algorithms .",
    "each algorithm has a different @xmath20 associated with it .",
    "some events are tagged by more than one algorithm , and those two tags may agree or disagree .",
    "* due to experimental acceptance , not every event in our sample has a precisely determined proper decay time . *",
    "due to experimental acceptance , the efficiencies for positive and negative tracks are not identical ( although the correction factor is tiny . )",
    "we handle these effects with a maximum likelihood fit that accounts for the probability that any given event is signal versus background and tagged correctly versus incorrectly . in doing so ,",
    "we not only account for the multiple flavor tagging algorithms and the background in our data , but the correlations between all of these elements is handled as well.@xcite    = 4truein      the final result of our analysis is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym ] .",
    "the points are the @xmath19 data , after having subtracted out the contribution from the background .",
    "the data has also been corrected for the flavor tagging dilutions .",
    "the solid curve is the fit to the data of the functional form : @xmath30 , with @xmath31 constrained to the world average value .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is @xmath32 .",
    "the single point to the right shows all events that do not have a precisely measured lifetime . as shown earlier ,",
    "the time - integrated asymmetry is nonzero , therefore these events are quite useful in extracting @xmath32 .",
    "the result of this analysis is : @xmath33 this is consistent with the expectation of @xmath34 based upon indirect fits to other data .",
    "this result rules out @xmath35 at the 93% confidence level , not sufficient to claim observation of @xmath4 violation in the @xmath36 system . on the other hand ,",
    "this is the best direct evidence to date for @xmath4 violation in the @xmath36 system .",
    "when broken down into statistical and systematic components , the uncertainty is @xmath37 .",
    "the total uncertainty is dominated by the statistics of the sample and efficacy of the flavor tagging .",
    "the systematic uncertainty arises from the uncertainty in the dilution measurements ( @xmath23 . )",
    "however , the uncertainty on the dilution measurements are actually limited by the size of the data samples used to measure the dilutions . in other words , the * systematic uncertainty on @xmath32 is really a * statistical uncertainty on the @xmath20 s .",
    "as more data is accumulated in the future , both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in @xmath32 will decrease as @xmath38 . *",
    "*    figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] shows the contours which result from global fits to measured data in the @xmath36 and @xmath39 system.@xcite the dashed lines originating at ( 1,0 ) are the two solutions for @xmath40 corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "the solid lines are the @xmath42 contours for this result .",
    "clearly the result shown here is in good agreement with expectations .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath43 result presented here is comparable to the uncertainties from recent measurements by the belle and babar collaborations@xcite .",
    "while none of the measurements are yet to have the precision to stringently test the standard model , the fact that this measurement can be made in two very different ways is interesting .",
    "the hadron collider environment has an enormous @xmath44 cross section , but backgrounds make flavor tagging difficult . in the @xmath45 environment ,",
    "the production cross section is much smaller , but the environment lends itself more favorably to flavor tagging .",
    "these facts make the measurements performed in the different environments complementary to one another .",
    "= 4truein      the fermilab tevatron is scheduled to run again in 2001 .",
    "both cdf@xcite and d@xcite detectors are undergoing massive upgrades in order to handle more than a factor of 20 increase in data .",
    "in addition , @xmath45 @xmath36-factories at cornell ( cleo - iii),@xcite kek ( belle)@xcite and slac ( babar)@xcite are all currently taking data .",
    "finally , hera - b,@xcite a dedicated @xmath36 experiment at desy , also will begin taking data in 2001 .    on the timescale of 2003 - 2004",
    ", there could be as many as 5 different measurements of @xmath32 , all of them with an uncertainty of @xmath46 .",
    "putting these together would yield a world average measurement with an uncertainty of @xmath47 .",
    "although this alone will provide an impressive constraint upon the unitarity triangle , it will not be sufficient to thoroughly test the standard model for self - consistency .",
    "on the same timescale , improvements are required in the lengths of the sides of the triangle , as well as other measurements of the angles . finally , there are measurements of other quantities that are not easily related to the unitarity triangle that are important tests of the standard model .",
    "the following is a list of some of the measurements that will be undertaken and/or improved - upon in the coming years ( _ this is an incomplete list ) : _    * @xmath4 asymmetries in other modes : _ e.g. _ * * @xmath48 ; * * @xmath49 ; * * @xmath50 ; * * @xmath51 ; * * @xmath52 .",
    "* @xmath53 mixing .",
    "* rare @xmath36 decays : _",
    "e.g. @xmath54 ; @xmath55 .",
    "_ * radiative @xmath36 decays : _",
    "e.g. @xmath56 ; @xmath57 . _",
    "* improved measurements of @xmath58 : _",
    "e.g. @xmath59 ; @xmath60 . _",
    "* mass and lifetime of the @xmath61 meson . * mass and lifetimes of the @xmath36 baryons : _",
    "e.g. @xmath62 .",
    "_    it will take many years and a body of measurements to gain further insights into the mechanisms behind the ckm matrix and @xmath4 violation .",
    "advances in kaon physics over the last 40 years and advances in @xmath36 physics in the last 25 years have put us on track to carry out these measurements in the very near future .",
    "these measurements will hopefully bring us to a more fundamental understanding to the mechanism behind @xmath4 violation .",
