    "effective samplings in the conformational space by monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are necessary to predict the native structures of proteins . in the conventional canonical - ensemble simulations",
    "@xcite , however , it is difficult to realize effective samplings in complex systems such as proteins .",
    "this is because the usual canonical - ensemble simulations tend to get trapped in a few of many local - minimum states . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "various generalized - ensemble algorithms have been proposed ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the replica - exchange method ( rem )",
    "@xcite is one of the most well - known methods among the generalized - ensemble algorithms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the md version ) .",
    "it is easier to implement than the multicanonical algorithm @xcite , which is also one of the most well - known generalized - ensemble algorithms ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the md version ) , because we do not have to determine a probability weight factor in advance in the rem . in the multicanonical and similar algorithms @xcite",
    "we employ non - boltzmann weight factors as the probability weight factors .",
    "these non - boltzmann weight factors are not _ a priori _ known and have to be determined by tedious procedures . on the other hand ,",
    "the usual boltzmann weight factor is employed in rem , and therefore it is not necessary to determine the non - boltzmann weight factor . the rem uses non - interacting replicas of the target system with different temperatures and realizes a random walk in temperature space by exchanging the temperatures of pairs of replicas .",
    "accordingly , the simulation can avoid getting trapped in local - minimum free - energy states .    for large systems such as proteins in aqueous solution , however , the usual rem has a difficulty .",
    "we need to increase the number of replicas in proportion to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "large biomolecular systems , therefore , require a large number of replicas in the rem and hence huge amount of computation time . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "it was pointed out that the number of required replicas can be greatly decreased if only the parameter exchanges are performed in the multi - dimensional replica - exchange method ( mrem ) @xcite without temperature exchanges @xcite . in mrem replica exchanges in temperature and/or parameter in the potential energy",
    "are performed .",
    "mrem is also referred to as the hamiltonian replica - exchange method @xcite , and in the present article we use the latter terminology .",
    "when we perform simulations of a protein in explicit water solvent , most of the degrees of freedom is occupied by water molecules . in order to predict the native structure of a protein , for instance",
    ", we would like to sample effectively the conformational space of the protein rather than water molecules . as an application of the hamiltonian rem , therefore , berne and co - workers performed simulations of the peptide in explicit water solvent , in which the scales of the only interactions related to the protein are varied @xcite .",
    "they could achieve effective samplings in the conformational space of the peptide and saved cpu cost in comparison with the usual rem .",
    "moreover , another application of the hamiltonian rem was reported by kannan and zacharias @xcite .",
    "they focused on the backbone dihedral angles of the peptides and added biasing potential energy to the backbone dihedral angles .",
    "they could also achieve effective samplings in this space with the biasing potential energy .",
    "however , these biasing potential energy terms are complicated functions and highly dependent on force fields .    in this article",
    ", we propose a new type of hamiltonian rem where we exchange the scaling factor of the van der waals radius of solute atoms in the interaction terms among solute atoms only . by reducing this scaling factor ,",
    "the steric hindrance among solute atoms will be reduced and wide conformational space can be explored .",
    "we applied this method to the sytems of an alanine dipeptide with explicit water molecules and tested the effectiveness of the method by comparing the results with those from the conventional canonical method .    in section [ method : sec ]",
