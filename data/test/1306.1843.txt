    "the ( , ; hereafter , the ) is one of the first infrared sources discovered with an optical bipolar nebulosity @xcite .",
    "this object , usually referred to as a proto - planetary nebula ( @xcite ) , consists of the central star in the post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) phase and the physically - detached circumstellar shell , which is a consequence of mass loss during the preceding agb phase .",
    "while agb mass loss is qualitatively understood dust - driven , the exact physical mechanisms of the structure formation in the circumstellar shell are still not understood completely .",
    "the is known for its signature bipolar lobes and rather circular concentric arcs @xcite .",
    "while there are about a dozen sources with such arcs , the is known to possess the largest number of arcs ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these concentric arcs are qualitatively perceived as manifestations of some kind of mass loss modulations that took place during the early agb phase .",
    "however , the deduced temporal intervals do not match with any of the known theoretical temporal intervals ( e.g. , thermal pulsing and surface pulsations of agb stars ; @xcite ) .    one of the direct methods to understand the dynamics of the circumstellar structure formation is to perform a differential proper - motion analysis and _ measure _ the amount of relative translational motion of specific shell structures .",
    "we performed such an analysis for the bipolar lobes and the equatorial structures of the using nicmos imaging - polarimetry data taken with a 5.5-yr baseline and found that ( 1 ) the lobes expanded linearly ( i.e. , the expansion velocity linearly proportional to the distance to the expansion center ) , ( 2 ) the distance to the was @xmath5  pc , and ( 3 ) the object ( star and nebula ) itself experienced its own proper motion at ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) mas yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , we were unable to measure differential proper - motion of the concentric arcs because the nicmos field of view was too small and the surface brightnesses were too weak is in the near - ir .",
    "@xcite performed the latest attempt using acs / hrc and wfc3/uvis images with a 6.65-yr baseline .",
    "they reported ( 1 ) a uniform expansion of the bipolar lobes by 2.5% and ( 2 ) radial motion of the arcs by 007 .",
    "however , their analysis was limited to the central @xmath8 and lacked background reference sources to properly align multi - epoch images .",
    "hence , they were unable to confirm the bulk motion of the nebula and _ assumed _ that the shell structures expanded symmetrically .",
    "in this work , we performed differential proper - motion measurements of the concentric arcs using the archived imaging - polarimetry data from wfpc2 and acs / wfc , exploiting the data set s largest field of view , longest exposure time , and longest temporal baseline to overcome the deficiencies of the previous analyses .",
    "below , we describe the data set and reduction procedure (  2 ) , present the reduced imaging polarimetry data , differential proper - motion measurements , and results of our analysis (  3 ) , and summarize our finding (  4 ) .",
    "we used the archived data of the in the f606w band with polarizers taken with wfpc2 ( gto / wf2 - 6221 ; pi : j.  trauger ) on 1995 july 17 ( epoch 1 , hereafter ) and acs / wfc ( cal / acs-9586 ; pi : w.  sparks ) on 2002 october 16 ( epoch 2 , hereafter ) , which provide a 7.25-yr baseline ( table [ obs ] ) .",
    "we reduced the data using the pyraf / stsdas multidrizzle package version 3.13 @xcite to process the multi - program data into a common frame of reference . after removing cosmic - ray hits from the pipeline - calibrated data using _",
    "( @xcite ; there was only one exposure with each of the three wfpc2 polarizers ) , we performed two rounds of multidrizzle processes to refine the image alignment by using background point sources as spatial anchors .    in the end , we generated two sets of three polarizer images for a @xmath9 field at the @xmath10 pix@xmath2 scale centered at the catalog coordinates of the ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , these polarizer images were combined into two sets of stokes images via matrix transformations for each of the wfpc2 and acs polarizers as described by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we measured the amount of shift for each background source and rejected those that shifted more than two-@xmath13 of the distribution : after this exercise 31 sources were adopted as stationary spatial anchors . because the was imaged near the center of the instrument arrays ( central @xmath14 for wfpc2/wf and @xmath15 for acs / wfc ) these anchors are not affected by the geometric distortion , which may contribute to false proper motions near the aperture edges .",
    "the accuracy of alignment was assessed by a residual vector root - mean - square offset computed from the gaussian centroid positions of these 31 spatial anchors and determined to be as good as 0.36 pix ( 0018 ) .",
    "the stokes _ i _ images ( figs .  [ figimages]a , b ) are the total flux images at the broad v band in the ab magnitude system @xcite .",
    "these maps show the signature bipolar lobes plus the searchlight beams as well as the concentric arcs .",
    "the two - epoch aperture photometry revealed that the total integrated flux of the decreased by @xmath16 over 7.25  yrs , while the individual fluxes of the n and s lobes decreased by 34% and 41% , respectively ( table [ photom ] ) .",
    "@xcite reported similar but smaller flux variations , with the n lobe faded more than the s lobe ( by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ) , over 6.65-yr baseline immediately following ours .",
    "moreover , @xcite discovered that the integrated flux of the n lobe varies with a roughly 90-day period .",
    "these observations suggest that both n and s lobes vary their fluxes periodically with a phase lag , which is probably a manifestation of the pulsation of the central star modulated by the time - delay due to the line - of - sight path - length difference between the two lobes of the inclined nebula .",
    "the linearly - polarized - flux - only images , @xmath19 , were constructed with the stokes _ q _ and _ u _ images ( @xmath20 ; figs .",
    "[ figimages]c , d ) . in the single - scattering limit ,",
    "@xmath19 images represent the cross - sections of the circumstellar shell because @xmath19 tends to be the strongest when the angle of scattering is close to @xmath21 .",
    "this uniqueness of @xmath19 had been used previously to probe the dust density structure in the evolve star circumstellar shells @xcite .",
    "contrary to our expectations , however , the bipolar lobes and searchlight beams appeared more prominently than the concentric arcs ( figs .",
    "[ figimages]c , d ) .",
    "this indicates that the nebula can not be approximated in the single - scattering limit ( as evidenced by the presence of the dust lane ) : the is therefore illuminated by a two - step process , in which starlight is first directed into the lobes and then scattered off from the lobes to the rest of the nebula .",
    "the polarization strength images , @xmath22 , display the relative strength of polarization more clearly ( figs .",
    "[ figimages]e , f ) . while stronger polarizations ( @xmath23 ) are seen in the lobes and searchlight beams , weaker polarizations ( @xmath24 )",
    "are dominant along the equatorial plane except for the region of medium polarizations ( about 30 to @xmath25 , delineating the central @xmath26 region around the dust lane ( @xmath27 by @xmath28 au at 420 pc ) .",
    "this medium - polarization region appears to represent the surface of a marginal central dust concentration ( often referred to as a dust cocoon ; @xcite ) at which the line - of - sight optical depth at @xmath29 becomes greater than unity ( i.e. , dustsphere as in photosphere and molsphere ) .",
    "this dustsphere and the bipolar lobes are essentially brightly - lit surfaces that illuminate the rest of the nebula .",
    "hence , dust - scattered light from the rest of the nebula tends to be de - polarized , i.e. , weak in @xmath19 and @xmath30 .",
    "the structure of this central dust concentration is still unknown .",
    "@xcite reported the presence of a hollow co shell of @xmath31 radius expanding at @xmath32  km  s@xmath2 at the position angle of @xmath33 ( coincident with the orientation of the 1.3 mm dust continuum ) .",
    "thus , this medium - polarization - strength region could represent the `` near - side surface '' of this central expanding co / dust shell . to better assess the geometry of the central material distribution , further investigations at higher spatial resolution at optically - thin bands are required .      the polarization angle ( _ pa _",
    "@xmath34 ) images show the position angle of the electric vector of the incident light ( figs .",
    "[ figimages]g , h ) .",
    "images for optically - thin nebulae typically show a pattern of an azimuthal gradient , which represents continuously changing polarization vector angles with respect to the position of the illumination source .",
    "however , our maps reveal roughly the same angle near the center generally aligned with the dust lane ( @xmath35 of e of n ) , indicating higher dust density around the dust lane at which the single - scattering approximation breaks down . for this reason",
    ", we were unable to pinpoint the location of the illumination source by back - tracing the polarization vectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) more accurately than a one-@xmath13 error ellipse of @xmath36 .",
    "as discussed above , the optical reflection nebulosity of the is caused by a two - step illumination process in rather de - polarized light .",
    "therefore , we reverted to the total intensity @xmath37 maps ( i.e. , to utilise all the flux available to us ) to follow the differential proper - motion of local shell structures using the same correlational method as in our previous analysis .",
    "briefly , this method measures the amount of translational shift of a given structure between two epochs via a cross - correlation analysis between cutouts of the two - epoch images ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use our own idl script set created as part of our previous proper - motion investigations of the in the near - ir ( @xcite for details ) .    to make the analysis more tractable with the @xmath37 maps , we edge - enhanced the shell structure while minimizing the background noise by processing the maps with the roberts cross operator @xcite .",
    "these maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ figroberts ] . because concentric arcs are azimuthally symmetric",
    ", the present correlational method is unable to break the azimuthal degeneracy and uniquely trace translational shifts of arc segments along the azimuthal direction .",
    "this prevented us from following the differential proper - motion of structures azimuthally away from the bipolar axis , and hence , from independently confirming the bulk motion of the nebula and location of the expansion center .",
    "thus , for the present analysis we adopted the previously discovered ( 1 ) bulk motion of the at a rate of ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) mas yr@xmath2 , ( 2 ) the location of the illumination source / expansion center , and ( 3 ) the distance to the at @xmath5  pc as found in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "we then selected 30 distinct local structures that register more than five s / n with respect to the sky background distributed in the lobes ( 13 structures ) and searchlight beams radially beyond the lobes ( 17 structures ) and performed the correlational analysis to measure proper motion of these structures . to disregard the inadvertent azimuthal shifts",
    ", we extracted only the projected radial component of the expansion of the structures as presented in fig .",
    "[ figvectors]a .",
    "the same data are displayed as a plot of the projected radial component of the differential proper - motion vector ( @xmath38 in mas  yr@xmath2 and km  s@xmath2 ) vs.  projected radial distance from the location of the illumination source / expansion center ( @xmath39 in arcsec ) in fig .",
    "[ figvectors]b . for each of the lobes and arc segments ,",
    "linear fitting was done to characterize its proper motion . upon fitting , we consider the following three plausible cases : ( 1 ) a linear expansion ( linear fitting of @xmath38 vs.  @xmath39 anchored at the origin ) , ( 2 ) a constant - speed expansion ( fitting by a horizontal line ) , and ( 3 ) a more general linear expansion ( linear fitting with a non - zero intercept ) , and compared their bayesian and akaike information criteria ( bic and aic ) to identify the best - fit . uncertainties in the projected speed and distances are roughly 5.0  mas  yr@xmath2 and 2@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "however , the _ relative _ spacing among individual structures within an ensemble remains the same and hence the slope of the linear fitting is robust .",
    "the best - fit for the lobes yielded @xmath41  mas  yr@xmath2 or @xmath42  km  s@xmath2 ( the solid white line in the dark - gray zone ) , indicating that the lobes are expanding linearly with the dynamical age of @xmath43  yr , which is roughly consistent with the previous results , @xmath44 and @xmath45  yr ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite measured the line of sight velocity of the tips of the co bipolar lobes ( coinciding with the optical lobe tip pair f1/f2 in their figs .  2 and 3 ) as @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 at @xmath47 away from the center .",
    "by adopting the projected radial expansion velocity of @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 at the tip of the n lobe , the inclination of the bipolar tips is computed as @xmath49 and the deprojected bipolar outflow velocity as @xmath50  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this outflow velocity is consistent with the medium - velocity component found in co @xcite .",
    "the best - fit for the arc segments along the searchlight beams beyond the lobes turned out to be a constant - speed expansion at @xmath51  mas  yr@xmath2 or @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 ( the solid black line in the light - gray zone ) , suggesting that the arcs have been ejected in an on - going basis and coasting away at a constant speed , as opposed to being formed altogether at the same time and expanding linearly .",
    "this is a new finding from the present analysis with a larger field of view with respect to the previous analysis by @xcite , in which both growth patterns were found equally likely .",
    "a detection of the central co shell of @xmath31 radius expanding at around 10  km  s@xmath2 reported by @xcite , therefore , may be related to the presence of these concentric arcs .",
    "if so , the generation of the concentric arcs appears to have been continuing even after the onset of the bipolar lobe expansion .      to further alleviate the azimuthal degeneracy issue of the concentric arcs , we `` unrolled '' the edge - enhanced @xmath37 maps with respect to the adopted location of the expansion center to make polar ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) maps , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the radial distance from the center and the position angle measured from n , respectively",
    "then , we traced the projected radial motion of concentric arcs as a function of the position angle by performing the same correlational analysis only along the radial direction for each @xmath55 azimuthal arc segment as long as these arc segments register more than three-@xmath13 of the background ( fig .",
    "[ figunrolled]a , b ) .    fig .",
    "[ figunrolled]c shows the distribution of the projected radial velocities of these 1@xmath56 segments measured along 12 most prominent arcs . while uncertainties are relatively large owing to a large s / n discrepancy between the two - epoch maps , the present data suggest that the projected radial velocities tend to ( 1 ) converge to a minimum of about 10  km  s@xmath2 toward the regions of the searchlight beams / bipolar axis , and ( 2 ) increase by a factor of about a few as moving toward the equatorial plane .",
    "while the scatterer in the measured radial velocities is large , the increasing tendency appears genuine .    if there were a well - defined azimuthal / latitudinal gradient in the radial expansion velocity field , it should have manifested itself in the overall structure of the concentric arcs ",
    "the arcs should have been elongated along the equatorial plane at least by a factor of a few",
    ". however , the arcs strikingly concentric .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that there is a faster outflow ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath2 ) in spatially restricted regions along the equatorial plane and that arc segments along the equatorial plane must have been blown out by such an outflow  the higher - velocity segments near the end of the observed arcs are most likely the arc edges being torn off by the suspected outflow .",
    "combined altogether , it appears that there are three distinct outflow components in the circumstellar environs of the .",
    "there is a generally spherically symmetric steady outflow with a periodical modulation at about 10  km  s@xmath2 , which is responsible for the concentric arcs .",
    "based on the arc segments seen farthest from the center in the higher - s / n epoch 2 map , this periodic outflow appears to have continued at least for the past @xmath3  yr at the interval of @xmath58  yr at 420  pc .",
    "this generally symmetric shell structure seems to be disrupted by two distinct outflow components , one along the bipolar axis and the other along the equatorial plane .",
    "it has already been shown that the bipolar lobes have been being excavated by a linear expansion for the past @xmath59  yr with the tip velocity being about 30  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "circumstantially , this linearly expanding outflow along the polar axis seems to have punched holes out of the central dust cocoon , through which most of the dust - scattered light streams out along the bipolar axis to illuminate the lobes .",
    "the present analysis of the concentric arcs has indicated the presence of another outflow component along the equatorial plane : its velocity appears to be greater than @xmath60  km  s@xmath2 based on the ways that concentric arcs are being disrupted along the equatorial plane .",
    "other observational details of this outflow including the mode and duration , however , remain unclear .",
    "the apparent superposition of three outflow components in the is dynamically very intriguing .",
    "while theoretical consideration of the latitudinal dependence of the _ velocity _ field has been rare ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in studying the influence of the central binary system to the agb wind structure , @xcite numerically discovered that ( 1 ) the latitudinal dependence of the gas density is always accompanied by a latitudinal decline in the outflow velocity field , and ( 2 ) there can be a positive correlation between the latitudinal density and velocity contrasts ( i.e. , outflow velocity becomes faster where density is greater ; their model 4 ) , contrary to many dust - driven models that _ assume _ a velocity profile that increases toward the polar direction .",
    "this means that the present case may provide rare observational evidence for such a colatitudinally - dependent outflow velocity field resulting from the egg - beater mass - loss modulation by the central binary system . while spiral modulation of mass - loss ejecta due to the central binary system has been seen around agb stars for near pole - on cases ( afgl 3068 ; @xcite , mira ; @xcite , r scl ; @xcite ) , the present data may lend support for an edge - on case in which ( 1 ) the spiraling trails of mass - loss ejecta appear as concentric arcs , and ( 2 ) the colatitudinal velocity field promotes an equatorial outflow fast enough to disrupt the ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    one issue in the present analysis",
    "is that the discrepancy in the signal strengths in the two - epoch data set ( due to much lesser s / n of epoch 1 data ) resulted in rather large uncertainties in proper - motion measurements . at any rate , both theoretical and observational work is scarce at best to establish the connection between the concentric arcs and the binary modulation of stellar winds",
    "therefore , another epoch of _ hst _ observations to obtain data with a comparable s / n to the epoch 2 data are extremely interesting in quantifying the colatitudinal dependence of the radial velocity field to be compared against the latest theoretical expectations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , mapping these concentric arcs in co at the comparable spatial resolution of the full _ alma _ is worthwhile ( e.g. , @xcite ) to do understand kinematics between the gas and dust components of these outflows .",
    "we performed differential proper - motion and radial - motion analyses on both the signature bipolar lobes and concentric arcs of the using two - epoch optical data taken by the _ hst_.",
    "our method , based on ( 1 ) aligning two - epoch images using stationary background stars as spatial anchors , and ( 2 ) measuring the amount translational movement of specific local structures by a correlational method , is more robust than the previous analysis by @xcite that assumed symmetry in the shell expansion .",
    "our findings are that ;    1 .",
    "the is illuminated optically by a two - step mechanism , in which the direct starlight is first channeled into the bipolar cavities and then scattered off to the rest of the nebula , 2 .",
    "there is a `` dustsphere '' around the central star ( @xmath27  au by @xmath28 au at 420  pc ) , most likely representing the surface of the central dust concentration at which the line - of - sight optical depth in the @xmath29 band becomes significantly larger than unity , 3 .",
    "the bipolar lobes expand linearly for the past @xmath43  yr , excavating into an otherwise symmetric concentric shells as found by the previous analyses @xcite , 4 .",
    "arc segments found along the searchlight beams beyond the bipolar lobes all move at similar projected radial velocity at @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 for the past @xmath3  yr , 5 .",
    "the projected radial expansion velocity field of the concentric arcs shows an increasing trending toward the equatorial plane by a factor of a few , representing torn - off edges of the arcs disrupted by a fast equatorial outflow at @xmath61  km  s@xmath2 , and 6",
    ".   the present case may provide observational evidence for the binary modulation of stellar winds , as predicted by @xcite , which generates the colatitudinal dependence in the radial expansion velocity field and the spiral - shocks of the mass - loss ejecta appearing concentric arcs in near edge - on orientations .",
