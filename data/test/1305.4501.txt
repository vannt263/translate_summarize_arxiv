    "the moduli space @xmath8 of algebraic curves of genus @xmath9 , defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath0 , is an interesting object that has received plenty of attention since the mid xx - century .",
    "it is an irreducible quasi - projective variety of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "understanding the stratification of this space has been also a major problem with many papers written on the subject to this day .",
    "there are two main difficulties on this problem :    _ i ) an explicit description of @xmath8 is not known ( i.e. , a coordinate in @xmath8 ) , _    _",
    "ii ) a list of automorphism groups for a fixed @xmath9 has not been known .",
    "_ + naturally one has a better chance to address the above problem if focused on the hyperelliptic sublocus @xmath11 of @xmath8 , since it is easier to pick a coordinate on the space @xmath11 .",
    "after all , the hyperelliptic curves were well understood since the xix - century and restricting the problem to the hyperelliptic locus seems reasonable .",
    "it was well known to classical algebraic geometers of the xix - century that the isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath0 correspond to the orbits of the @xmath12 action on the space of binary forms of degree @xmath13 with coefficients from @xmath0 .",
    "this was , among others , one of the main motivations of the invariant theory during the xix - century .",
    "for the generalization to the case of superelliptic curves one can check @xcite .",
    "the case of genus 2 had been studied extensively by xix - century mathematicians ; see @xcite even though the concept of the moduli space was not quite refined at the time .",
    "about a decade ago gaudry / schost in @xcite attacked the problem for @xmath14 from the computational point of view .",
    "after all , a coordinate in @xmath15 could be fixed using the igusa invariants and the list of automorphism groups of genus 2 was known ; see @xcite among others . at the same time that @xcite was being circulated as a preprint ,",
    "shaska / vlklein @xcite considered the problem from a more group - theoretical point of view .",
    "of course , the main case in both those papers was the case when the genus 2 curves had an elliptic involution .",
    "the locus @xmath16 of such curves is a 2-dimensional irreducible variety in @xmath15 computed in both papers . in the process",
    ", a group action was discovered in @xcite and its @xmath17 invariants were instrumental in computing equations for the strata of @xmath15 .",
    "the map @xmath18 provides a birational parametrization of the space @xmath16 , where @xmath19 are @xmath12-invariants in the space of binary sextics . the singular locus of this map correspond to genus 2 curves with larger automorphism group ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3 ) .",
    "the paper @xcite spurred interest in two directions .",
    "first , it naturally brought to the attention of the authors the problem of automorphism groups of curves of genus @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to the ii ) part of the problem stated in the beginning .",
    "second , naturally raised the question whether the invariants @xmath17 for @xmath14 could be generalized to higher genus . in the next two paragraphs",
    "we consider each direction in more details",
    ".    determining the list of automorphism groups of algebraic curves of genus @xmath9 is a classical problem .",
    "there were hundreds of papers in the subject before 2001 , most of them considering specific cases for small genus . however , there was one interesting development at the time that it seems as it did not get the attention it deserved .",
    "breuer computed all signatures of the groups acting on compact riemann surfaces for genus @xmath20 ; see @xcite . the restriction",
    "@xmath20 is merely technical and breuer s algorithm works for any genus , providing that some careful analysis is required for sporadic cases . using results in @xcite and the theory of hurwitz spaces , magaard , shpectorov , shaska , vlklein determined an algorithm of how to determine the list of full automorphism groups of curves for any given genus @xmath9 ;",
    "see @xcite . in @xcite a complete list of full automorphism groups for curves of genus 3",
    "was determined and the corresponding equations were provided as a way to illustrate the methods described in that paper .",
    "there were tens of papers on the case of genus @xmath21 before @xcite appeared .",
    "moreover , by methods in @xcite the list of full automorphism groups of curves for any genus @xmath22 can be determined .",
    "this settles the second part ii ) of the initial problem .",
    "the second direction that was spurred by @xcite was the problem of generalizing the map to higher genus .",
    "natural questions to follow would be whether the curves with larger automorphism groups would be in the singular locus of @xmath23 .",
    "the group action discovered in @xcite was generalized in @xcite and then in a more formal paper in @xcite were such invariants in higher genus were called * dihedral invariants*. for a genus @xmath9 now we have a map @xmath24 where @xmath25 are @xmath12-invariants in the space of binary forms of degree @xmath26 . in papers",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite the case of stratification of the hyperelliptic moduli @xmath2 was treated to illustrate the general theory .",
    "dihedral invariants have been used quite extensively since by many authors .",
    "they were generalized for fields of positive characteristic by @xcite and are defined again in the projective version in @xcite , where they are renamed as _ dihedral arithmetic invariants_.    this paper takes another look at the study of genus 3 hyperelliptic curves with extra automorphisms .",
    "the general strategy for @xmath21 was quite obvious a decade ago ; one computes the shioda invariants defined in @xcite starting from the table 1 of @xcite and then eliminating the parameters which appear as coefficients of the curve .",
    "such computations were simplified considerable via the dihedral invariants @xmath27 .",
    "there was an obvious drawback compared to the genus @xmath14 case ; the @xmath12-invariants for @xmath21 were not known .",
    "hence , the obvious strategy was to describe the strata in terms of the @xmath28-invariants defined by shioda in @xcite .",
    "this approach is taken in @xcite .",
    "it is not clear from @xcite if the dihedral invariants were used in these computations or they were performed straight from the equations of the curves as in table 3 in @xcite . in any case ,",
    "shioda invariants @xmath29 are computed in @xcite and using syzygies determined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) the authors determine each loci in @xmath2 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the syzygies determined by shioda in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) are not correct .",
    "it is unclear if the authors in @xcite have corrected such syzygies , otherwise all the results of @xcite could be incorrect .",
    "the motivation for this paper was the definition of @xmath30-invariants in @xcite where an explicit equation of the hyperelliptic moduli @xmath2 is given in the ambient space @xmath31 . using the absolute invariants",
    "@xmath32 as in @xcite and the dihedral invariants @xmath27 one can easily compute the locus in @xmath2 for each case of table 3 of @xcite .",
    "the drawback of invariants @xmath32 is that they are not defined everywhere .",
    "however , this is done by choice so that their degrees are kept small .",
    "this makes computations a lot easier .",
    "one can get projective equations ( i.e. , equations in terms of @xmath33 ) from our equations simply by replacing @xmath32 with their definitions and clearing denominators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the invariants of the binary octavics and definitions of absolute invariants .",
    "notice that our definitions of @xmath33 are slightly different from those of shioda . in section 3",
    "we discuss genus 3 hyperelliptic curves with an elliptic involution and derive an parametric equation for such family of curves .",
    "this is rather known material that has been treated in @xcite .",
    "section 4 is the main section of the paper where the equation for the locus of curves with an elliptic involution .",
    "the main theorem here describes the equation of the irreducible sub variety @xmath3 in the hyperelliptic moduli @xmath2 .",
    "we show that for a generic curve @xmath34 in @xmath3 the field of definition is at most a degree 2 extension of the field of moduli .",
    "this is an improvement from @xcite where it is shown that this bound is eight .",
    "for example , for the case when the group is @xmath35 , we get a model for the parametric curve defined over a quadratic extension of the field of moduli versus a degree 8 extension in @xcite .    in section 5",
    ", we determine the equation of all 1 and 2-dimensional loci for any fixed automorphism group @xmath5 .",
    "parametrization of such loci were also given in @xcite .",
    "here we compute them in terms of the absolute invariants @xmath32 .",
    "the goal of this paper was to describe the stratification of the space @xmath2 in terms of the absolute invariants @xmath32 .",
    "the benefit of this approach is that there are fewer equations and even simpler ones .",
    "the results in @xcite make it possible that we do not have to use the invariants @xmath36 and have fewer equations in each case .",
    "we get better results compared to @xcite in the case of the group @xmath35 and @xmath37 on the minimal equation of the curves over their field of moduli .    in the case of group",
    "@xmath37 we prove that the field of moduli is a field of definition and give a model of the curve over its field of definition .",
    "some of these results were not new to us , since they were proved in @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we are able to explicitly describe such results in terms of the absolute invariants @xmath32 .",
    "all our results are implemented in a maple package which is provided for free on @xcite .",
    "* notation : * throughout this paper , by a `` curve '' we mean an irreducible algebraic curve defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath0 .",

    "we call @xmath52 the * elliptic involution * of @xmath34 corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "hence , the space @xmath56 is exactly the space of genus 3 hyperelliptic curves with elliptic involutions .",
    "such space has beed studied before from the point of view of automorphism groups , as described in details in the introduction .    for a fixed group @xmath5 acting on a genus @xmath57 algebraic curves",
    "@xmath58 we have a covering @xmath59 .",
    "all possible ramification structures of such covering for any genus @xmath57 hyperelliptic curves were determined in @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is also done for all superelliptic curves ; see @xcite for details . in the case of hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 ,",
    "each group occurs only with one signature ; see @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no confusion if we denote by @xmath60 the locus in @xmath2 of all curves with automorphism group isomorphic to @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) .",
    "the loci @xmath60 is not a priori irreducible . in general ,",
    "irreducibility is checked by the braid action on nielsen tuples .",
    "the locus @xmath62 is a hurwitz space of covers with monodromy group @xmath5 and fixed ramification structure .",
    "however , under our assumptions ( @xmath21 and hyperelliptic ) this is always the case as shown in @xcite and we will avoid that discussion here .",
    "let @xmath63 be a genus 3 hyperelliptic field .",
    "then @xmath63 has exactly one genus 0 subfield of degree 2 , call it @xmath64 .",
    "it is the fixed field of the * hyperelliptic involution * @xmath65 in @xmath66 .",
