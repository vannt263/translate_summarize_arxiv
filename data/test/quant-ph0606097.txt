    "physical systems where the interactions between the constituent particles are weak and can be treated perturbatively are mostly well understood . a precise understanding of strongly correlated systems however appears to be much harder to obtain because the experimental observation of several important mechanisms is less feasible .",
    "many processes take place at high energy and therefore on fast timescales while precise control over individual constituent particles is very hard to achieve .",
    "this unattainability of detailed control lies at the heart of the difficulties to experimentally implement quantum information processes .",
    "nonetheless , substantial progress has been achieved recently by considering cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice @xcite , which can effectively be described by a bose - hubbard hamiltonian . this idea lead to several important experiments emulating condensed matter phenomena .",
    "the most prominent example is probably the observation of the superfluid to mott insulator quantum phase transition @xcite in a three dimensional lattice , but also other geometries like a kagome lattice @xcite or a tonks girardeau gas @xcite are being studied . even theoretical ideas for the implementation of quantum information processing have been pursued by entangling neighbouring atoms via controlled collisions @xcite .",
    "in addition , these systems could act as quantum simulators , where the dynamics of a rather complex hamiltonian can be simulated in an experiment by eather creating the hamiltonian in question , or trotter decomposing the evolution into small steps , where the dynamics of each step is generated by a much simpler hamiltonian @xcite .    despite their success ,",
    "optical lattices are in all their applications limited by an intrinsic draw back : it is exceedingly difficult to access individual lattice sites , since their separation is only half of the employed optical wavelength .",
    "here we propose an alternative way to create an effective bose - hubbard model and other hamiltonians , which does not suffer from this problem .",
    "we consider two realisations of an array of cavities and study the dynamics of polaritons , combined atom photon excitations , in this arrangement . since the distance between adjacent cavities is considerably larger than the optical wavelength of the resonant mode , individual cavities can be addressed .",
    "photon hopping occurs between neighboring cavities while the repulsive force between two polaritons occupying the same site is generated by a large kerr nonlinearity that occurs if atoms with a specific level structure usually considered in electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite interact with light .",
    "each cavity is interacting with an ensemble of these atoms , which are driven by an external laser , see fig .",
    "[ crystal ] . by varying the intensity of the driving laser , the nonlinearity can be tuned and hence the system can be driven through the superfluid to mott insulator transition .",
    "in particular , the driving laser may be adjusted for each cavity individually allowing for a much wider range of tuning possibilities than in an optical lattice , including attractive interactions .",
    "our system can be described in terms of three species of polaritons , where under the conditions specified below , the species which is least vulnerable to decay processes is governed by the effective bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian , @xmath0 @xmath1 creates a polariton in the cavity at site @xmath2 and the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe on site repulsion and inter cavity hopping respectively .",
    "the most promising candidates for an experimental realisation are toroidal or spherical micro - cavities , which are coupled via tapered optical fibres @xcite .",
    "these cavities can be produced and positioned with high precision and in large numbers .",
    "they have a very large q - factor ( @xmath5 ) for light that is trapped as whispering gallery modes and efficient coupling to optical fibres @xcite as well as coupling to cs - atoms in close proximity to the cavity via the evanescent field @xcite have been demonstrated experimentally very recently .    in the longer term",
    ", photonic crystals represent an appealing alternative as they offer the possibility for the fabrication of large arrays of cavities in lattices or networks @xcite .",
    "obviously , our concept is not limited to certain geometries , as it is the case for the optical lattice .",
    "any arrangement of the cavity array may be considered .",
    "we first derive the hamiltonian ( [ bosehubbard ] ) for the considered structure and then present a theoretical analysis of the feasible parameter range , which is backed up by a full numerical demonstration of the superfluid to mott insulator transition including experimental imperfections .",
    "we consider a periodic array of cavities , which we describe here by a periodic dielectric constant ,     our model consists of an array of cavities , where photon hopping occurs due to the overlap ( shaded green ) of the light modes ( green lines ) of adjacent cavities .",
    "atoms in each cavity ( brown ) , which are driven by external lasers ( blue ) give rise to an on site repulsion.,width=302 ]    @xmath6    for all tupels of integers @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the dielectric constant @xmath8 to be real , i.e. we neglect absorption processes , and limit our considerations to linear , isotropic dielectric media . the electromagnetic field",
    "may be represented by a vector potential @xmath9 and a scalar potential @xmath10 which obey the gauge conditions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 can be expanded in wannier functions , @xmath13 , each localised at one single cavity at location @xmath2 .",
    "we describe this single cavity by the dielectric function @xmath14 such that the wannier functions satisfy the eigenvalue equation , @xmath15 where the eigenvalue @xmath16 is the square the resonance frequency of the cavity which is independent of @xmath2 due to the periodicity .",
    "we assume that the wannier functions decay strongly enough outside the cavity such that only wannier modes of nearest neighbour cavities have nonvanishing overlap .    in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of the wannier modes ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 , the hamiltonian of the field can be written , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the sum of all pairs of cavities which are nearest neighbours of each other . since @xmath21",
    ", we neglected rotating terms which contain products of two creation or two annihilation operators of wannier modes in deriving ( [ arrayham2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath22 is given by @xcite , @xmath23 ) provides an excellent approximation to many relevant implementations such as coupled photonic crystal micro - cavities or fibre coupled toroidal micro - cavities .",
    "furthermore , it allows for the observation of state transfer @xcite and entanglement dynamics and propagation for gaussian states @xcite as the hamiltonian is harmonic . in the next section we present a possible realisation of the repulsive term in the hamiltonian ( [ bosehubbard ] )",
    "to generate a repulsion between polaritons that are located in the same cavity , we fill the cavity with 4 level atoms of a particular level structure that are driven with an external laser in the same manner as in electromagnetically induced transparency , see figure [ level ] : the transitions between levels 2 and 3 are coupled to the laser field and the transitions between levels 2 - 4 and 1 - 3 couple via dipole moments to the cavity resonance mode .     the level structure and the possible transitions of one atom , @xmath24 is the frequency of the cavity mode",

    "the hamiltonian of the atoms in the cavity reads , @xmath32 where @xmath33 projects level @xmath34 of atom @xmath35 to level @xmath36 of the same atom , @xmath24 is the frequency of the cavity mode , @xmath25 is the rabi frequency of the driving by the laser and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the parameters of the dipole coupling of the cavity mode to the respective atomic transitions which are all assumed to be real .",
    "since we are only interested in the situation , where there is on average one excitation in each cavity and since the probability to have two excitations in one cavity is suppressed by the kerr nonlinearity , it is appropriate to only consider states with at most two excitations per cavity .",
    "all atoms interact in the same way with the cavity mode and hence the only relevant states are dicke type dressed states . neglecting two photon detuning and coupling to level 4 , the hamiltonian ( [ h_manyatom ] ) can be written as a model of three species of polaritons in this subspace .      in the case where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , level 4 of the atoms decouples from the rest of the two excitation manifold @xcite .",
    "if we furthermore assume that the number of atoms is large , @xmath39 , the hamiltonian ( [ h_manyatom ] ) truncated to the subspace of at most two excitations can be diagonalised .",
    "let us therefore define the following creation ( and annihilation ) operators : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the operators @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 describe polaritons , quasi particles formed by combinations of atom and photon excitations . by looking at their matrix representation in the subspace of at most two excitations",
    ", one can see that in the limit of large atom numbers , @xmath39 , they satisfy bosonic commutation relations , @xmath49 = \\ , 0 \\quad ; \\quad \\left [ p_j , p_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] = \\delta_{jl } \\quad ; \\quad j , l = 0,+,- \\ , .\\ ] ] @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 thus describe independent bosonic particles . in terms of these polaritons",

    "we will now focus on the dark state polaritons , @xmath46 , which can be described by the hamiltonian ( [ bosehubbard ] ) as we shall see .      to write the full hamiltonian @xmath54 , ( [ h_manyatom ] ) , in the polariton basis",
    ", we express the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 in terms of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in the subspace of at most two excitations , the coupling of the polaritons to the level 4 of the atoms via the dipole moment @xmath27 reads , @xmath57 where @xmath58 . in deriving ( [ coupletolevel4 ] ) , we made use of the rotating wave approximation : in a frame rotating with respect to ( [ h0polariton ] ) , the polaritonic creation operators rotate with the frequencies @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , the operator @xmath62 rotates at the frequency @xmath63 , ( c.f .",
    "( [ h_manyatom ] ) ) .",
    "hence , provided that @xmath64 or @xmath65 or @xmath66 can be neglected , which eliminates all interactions that would couple @xmath46 and @xmath62 to the remaining polariton species .    for @xmath67",
    ", the coupling to level 4 can be treated in a perturbative way .",
    "this results in an energy shift of @xmath68 with @xmath69 and in an occupation probability of the state of one @xmath62 excitation of @xmath70 , which will determine an effective decay rate for the polariton @xmath46 via spontaneous emission from level 4 ( see below ) .",
    "note that @xmath71 for @xmath72 and vice versa . in a similar way",
    ", the two photon detuning @xmath30 leads to and energy shift of @xmath73 for the polariton @xmath46 , which plays the role of a chemical potential in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "hence , provided ( [ rotatingwappr ] ) holds , the hamiltonian for the dark state polariton @xmath46 can be written as @xmath74 in the rotating frame .",
    "next we turn to estimate the effects of loss and decoherence .",
    "since level 2 of the atoms is metastable and hence its decay rate negligible on the relevant time scales , the dark state polaritons @xmath46 suffer loss and decoherence via two processes only : the photons are subject to cavity decay at a rate @xmath75 and spontaneous emission from the atomic level 4 at a rate @xmath76 induces an effective decay via its small but nonvanishing occupation .",
    "taking into account the definition ( [ polariton_operators ] ) of @xmath46 and the effective decay of @xmath46 induced by the occupation of level 4 , we obtain the following decay rate @xmath77 for the polaritons @xmath46 : @xmath78 due to @xmath67 , spontaneous emission from level 4 affects the polaritons much less than cavity decay .    for successfully observing the dynamics and phases of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heffect ] ) , the repulsion term @xmath3 needs to be much larger than the damping @xmath77 .",
    "choosing @xmath79 , one can achieve a ratio of @xmath80 for photonic band gap cavities @xcite , while for toroidal micro - cavities the much larger value of @xmath81 is possible , which makes them an ideal candidate for an experimental implementation @xcite . in the next section we turn to combine the on site repulsion for polaritons with the photon hopping between neighbouring cavities .",
    "now we look at an array of cavities which forms a periodic dielectric medium , see fig . [ crystal ] .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ arrayham2 ] ) has already been incorporated in the polariton analysis for one individual cavity .",
    "the second term transforms into the polariton picture via ( [ polariton_operators ] ) . to distinguish between the dark state polaritons in different cavities , we introduce the notation @xmath1 to label the polariton @xmath46 in the cavity at position @xmath2 .",
    "we get , @xmath82 where we have applied a rotating wave approximation . contributions of different polaritons decouple due to the separation of their frequencies @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . as a consequence",
    "the hamiltonian for the polaritons @xmath1 takes on the form ( [ bosehubbard ] ) , with @xmath83 where we have assumed a negligible two photon detuning , @xmath84 .",
    "to provide evidence for the accuracy of our approach , we present a numerical simulation of the dynamics of one dark state polariton in an array of three toroidal micro - cavities with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the polariton is initially located in cavity 2 , and we compare its dynamics to that of a pure bh model . in doing",

    "all our simulation results show a single trajectory of a quantum jump simulation @xcite . within the simulated time range the probability of a decay event remained less than @xmath103 .",
    "a key question is of course , whether the polaritons undergo the mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in the same way as a pure bh model .",
    "we give evidence for that in the next section .",
    "an important feature of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ bosehubbard ] ) are two phases of the matter it describes : one is a superfluid phase , where the hopping term dominates over the on site repulsion , @xmath104 , and the polaritons @xmath105 move almost freely between the cavities . as a consequence one can observe large fluctuations in the number of polaritons in each individual cavity .",
    "the other phase is the mott insulator , in which the on site repulsion is much stronger than the hopping term @xmath106 and double occupancies of a cavity are strongly suppressed .",
    "provided the system contains on average one polariton per cavity , this implies that in the mott phase the number of polaritons is exactly one for each cavity and number fluctuations are very small .    a numerical simulation of this phase transition is shown in figure [ vardiff4 ] .",
    "again we consider the parameters for coupled toroidal micro - cavities , but now we assume that the driving laser is tuned from very weak driving to strong driving throughout the experiment .",
    "we look at four coupled cavities with periodic boundary conditions , which are initially prepared such that there is one polariton @xmath46 in each .",

    "this also holds for the two cavities with deviations less than @xmath113 .",
    "the probability for a decay event is about 15% for the total simulated time range .",
    "next we mention some applications of the setup when operated with attractive on - site potential .",
    "as mentioned above , if the detuning @xmath29 is positive , the on - site potential becomes attractive .",
    "the ground state of the system with @xmath114 polaritons on @xmath114 sites and a strong attractive on - site potential is then a highly entangled @xmath115 state ; @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the state with all @xmath114 polaritons on site @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "although the ground state becomes degenerate in the limit @xmath118 , one can generate the @xmath115 state with high fidelity since the hopping terms do not induce transitions between the nearly degenerate low energy states .",
    "the procedure is robust against disorder as long as the hopping @xmath4 is stronger than the fluctuations of @xmath3 . in the @xmath115 state regime ,",
    "the polaritons enter a physically different phase , where the number fluctuations at one site become @xmath119 .",

    "we now turn to discuss how to distinguish different phases in a measurement .",
    "a possible way to detect whether or not there is a polariton present in a certain cavity is to make use of resonance fluorescence . to that end an additional probe laser",
    "is resonantely coupled to the transition between an atomic level 5 , which is well separated from the levels 1 - 4 , and the level 2 .",
    "the intensity of the probe laser needs to be weak enough such that its rabi frequency @xmath127 fulfils @xmath128 . in that case",
    "the probe laser couples a polariton @xmath46 to the extra level 5 while its coupling to the other polariton species is negligible .",
    "hence whenever resonant light is detected , at least one polariton @xmath46 must have been present in the cavity .",
    "provided there is on average one polariton per cavity , repeated measurements at several cavities reveal whether there has always been a polariton in each cavity ( mott phase ) or whether there are every now and then empty cavities indicating polariton number fluctuations ( superfluid phase ) .",
    "furthermore the fluorescence spectrum contains information about the energy differences between level 5 and the eigenstates of the polaritonic bh model . in the limit of negligible rabi frequency of the probe laser and negligible linewidth of level 5 , the exact spectrum of ( [ bosehubbard ] ) , which is gapped in the mott phase and gapless in the superfluid phase , could be observed . in the real situation",
    ", the finite rabi frequency of the probe laser has to be taken into account and the linewidth of level 5 limits the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "we have shown , that polaritons , combined atom - photon excitations , can form an effective quantum many particle system , which is described by a bose - hubbard hamiltonian , and numerically demonstrated that an observation of the mott insulator to superfluid phase transition is indeed feasible for experimentally realisable parameters .",
    "in contrast to earlier realisations in optical lattices , our scenario has the advantage that single sites of the bh model can be addressed individually .",
    "this feature opens up various new experimental possibilities : one can for example operate one part of the system in the mott insulator regime while the rest is in the superfluid phase and study the physics that happens at the boundary .",
    "this boundary may even be moved around during the experiment .",
    "local properties of the system may be probed @xcite . moreover being able to address individual sites",
    "is a prerequisite for the implementation of quantum information processes .",
    "hence we expect our proposal to lead to significant progress in that direction @xcite .",
    "in addition , our setup offers the possibility to create a bh type hamiltonian with an attractive on site potential , which is readily achieved by choosing the detuning @xmath29 to be positive , and may be used to generate highly entangled states @xcite .",
    "even designing many body systems with long range interactions seems feasible since toroidal micro - cavities are usually coupled to light in optical fibres @xcite .",
    "this fibre can the couple many cavities in a row without a significant decrease of the light field along it .",

    "<S> the experimental observation of quantum phenomena in strongly correlated many particle systems is difficult because of the short length- and timescales involved . </S>",
    "<S> obtaining at the same time detailed control of individual constituents appears even more challenging and thus to date inhibits employing such systems as quantum computing devices . </S>",
    "<S> substantial progress to overcome these problems has been achieved with cold atoms in optical lattices , where a detailed control of collective properties is feasible but it is very difficult to address and hence control or measure individual sites . here we show , that polaritons , combined atom and photon excitations , in an array of cavities such as a photonic crystal or coupled toroidal micro - cavities , can form a strongly interacting many body system , where individual particles can be controlled and measured . </S>",
    "<S> all individual building blocks of the proposed setting have already been experimentally realised , thus demonstrating the potential of this device as a quantum simulator . with the possibility to create attractive on - site potentials </S>",
    "<S> the scheme allows for the creation of highly entangled states and a phase with particles much more delocalised than in superfluids . </S>"
