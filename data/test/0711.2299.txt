    "the meson d@xmath8(2317 ) , discovered in 2003 .",
    "year in high energy electron - positron collisions at slac ( stanford linear accelerator center ) by the babar group @xcite and confirmed by belle experiments @xcite , possesses a mass of 2317 mev , some 170 mev lighter than expected , at least according to prevalent theories of quark interactions .",
    "hence physicists need a new explanation of how a charm quark attached to an antistrange quark should have this particular mass . in general , d@xmath11 and",
    "d mesons are a class of particles , each consisting of a charm quark attached to a light antiquark .",
    "the babar detection group at slac @xcite responsible for the experimental discovery suggests that the d@xmath8(2317 ) might be a novel particle made of four quarks .",
    "meson d@xmath10(2308 ) was discovered by belle group @xcite . the mass difference between strange d@xmath8(2317 ) and nonstrange d@xmath10(2308 )",
    "meson ( 9 mev ) is at least ten times below the expected value of @xmath12 - @xmath13 mass difference .",
    "also experimentally state d@xmath8(2632 ) ( discovered in selex experiments @xcite ) does not fit into former theoretical predictions because it is too light to be an ( radial ) excitation of the d@xmath8(2317 ) .",
    "jaffe @xcite suggested the possible existence of four - quark states for light flavor dimesons and made predictions for tetraquark spectroscopy . in ref .",
    "it is also provided a framework for a quark - model classification of the many two - quark - two - antiquark states .    in refs .",
    "the d@xmath8(2317 ) meson is explained as a scalar @xmath14 system : van beveren _",
    "claim that in their model , assuming that the meson is indeed a charm - antistrange combination , the mass comes out in the right range if the strong - nuclear - force interactions responsible for the creation and annihilation of extra quark - antiquark pairs are taken into account . according to van beveren and rupp @xcite and barnes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the d@xmath8(2632 ) resonance , being 0.52 gev heavier than the d@xmath11 ground state , could turn out to be the first radial excitation of the d@xmath11(2112 ) meson . on the other hand , terasaki and hayashigaki",
    "@xcite have assigned the d@xmath8(2317 ) to the t@xmath15 = 0 member of the isotriplet which belong to the lighter class of four - quark @xmath0 mesons and have investigated the decay rates of the members of the same multiplet . also in refs .",
    "it is shown that it might be expected that the measured d@xmath8(2317 ) is an exotic state with the structures of a four - quark .",
    "@xcite argue that the d@xmath8(2632 ) resonance may be a member of a scalar tetraquark multiplet .",
    "the possible tetraquark nature of the three mentioned mesons is discussed e.g. in refs . .",
    "the three charmed scalar mesons : d@xmath8(2317 ) , d@xmath10(2308 ) and d@xmath8(2632 ) does not fit well into predictions of the quark model because of these three reasons : ( i ) absolute mass of the d@xmath8(2317 ) is 170 mev below mass predicted from the quark model for the scalar @xmath14 meson , ( ii ) the small mass gap between d@xmath8(2317 ) and d@xmath10(2308 ) is puzzling and leads to a new model for these states .",
    "( iii ) the state d@xmath8(2632 ) does not fit into former theoretical predictions because it is too light to be an ( radial ) excitation of the d@xmath8(2317 ) .",
    "these three dissimilarities influenced giving some theoretical proposals about the possible structure of the mesons d@xmath8(2317 ) , d@xmath10(2308 ) and d@xmath8(2632 ) . according to this ,",
    "we analyze the possibility that these three states ( or some of them ) are tetraquarks .    in this work",
    "we perform a schematic study of the mass splitting of the single charmed @xmath0 tetraquarks in the su(3 ) flavor representations . in section",
    "ii we construct the wave functions of mentioned tetraquarks .",
    "then we present the flavor - spin glozman - riska interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the formalism of calculating su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking corrections to the flavor - spin interaction energy is presented in section iii .",
    "also it discusses meson and baryon fit and numerical analysis .",
    "the light and heavy meson and baryon experimental masses are fitted with aim to calculate the constituent quark masses and then to calculate tetraquark masses from our theoretical model .",
    "we discuss masses with glozman - riska ( gr ) @xcite hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) .",
    "equations that correspond to our theoretically predicted masses are given for all 27 @xmath0 states , as well as their numerical values .",
    "the quark model of confinement can not reproduce the spin - dependent hyperfine splitting in the hadron spectra without additional contributions from a hyperfine interaction .",
    "that is why we take into account gr hyperfine interaction .",
    "we include mass mixing effects for particles with the same quantum numbers and show it in mass spectra .",
    "the last section is a short summary .",
    "tetraquarks with charm quantum number c = 1 and with three light flavors are grouped by the same properties , into multiplets with the same baryon number , spin and intrinsic parity .",
    "if a particle belongs to a given multiplet , all of its isospin partners ( the same isotopic spin magnitude t and different 3-components t@xmath15 ) belong to the same multiplet .",
    "the flavor su(3 ) decomposition of the 27 possible @xmath16 combinations is given in figure [ fig01 ] by the young diagrams .",
    "under the transformation of su(3)@xmath1 , the charm quark is singlet .",
    "the numbers 15 , 3 , 3 and 6 are dimensions of young diagrams and they designate the number of particles in the same group i.e. su(3 ) flavor multiplet .",
    "particles belonging to the same multiplet have the same baryonic number , spin and intrinsic parity .",
    "they also have similar masses .",
    "weight diagrams which represent the following product : @xmath17 are given in figures @xmath18 .                in these weight diagrams",
    "ordinate shows hypercharge y :    @xmath19    where b is baryonic number ( 1/3 for quark , -1/3 for antiquark ) , s is strangeness ( -1 for @xmath20 quark , 1 for @xmath21 quark ) and c is charm ( 1 for @xmath6 quark , -1 for @xmath22 quark ) .",
    "so , for tetraquarks with one @xmath6 quark attached to one light quark and two light antiquarks , we have : @xmath23 and c = 1 .",
    "also , for electric charge of a particle , we have :    @xmath24    we plot the eigenvalues of t@xmath25 and y that occur for the quarks in a representation as points in the t@xmath25 - y plane .",
    "we first combine two of the antiquarks .",
    "the quantum numbers y and t@xmath25 are additive and thus their values for a @xmath26 state are obtained by simply adding the values for @xmath27 and @xmath27 .",
    "the points in the weight diagram for the @xmath28-representation are thus obtained by taking every point of one antiquark diagram to be the origin of another antiquark diagram .",
    "figure @xmath29 shows that the nine @xmath26 combinations arrange themselves into two su(3 ) multiplets , where the 3 is symmetric and the @xmath30 is antisymmetric under interchange of the two antiquarks .",
    "then we add the third quark triplet .",
    "the final decomposition is displayed in figures @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the subscripts s and a on the multiplets indicate that the flavor states are symmetric ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) under interchange of the last two antiquarks .    knowing quantum numbers for the set of 27 scalar tetraquarks , they are classified in groups as shown in figure @xmath33 .",
    "we denote the states with strangeness s = 2 as @xmath34 , with s = 1 as @xmath35 ( t = 1 ) and d@xmath11 ( t = 0 ) , with s = 0 as @xmath36 ( t = 3/2 ) and d ( t = 1/2 ) and with s = -1 as @xmath37 .        from the weight diagrams we read off the quark content of the tetraquarks .",
    "the four - quark content , as well as quantum numbers , calculated for all 27 states in the following su(3 ) representations : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "there is mixing between states from symmetric multiplets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and also between antisymmetric multiplets @xmath4 and @xmath5 , while symmetric and antisymmetric multiplets do not mix with each other . mixing is due to the same quantum numbers : electric charge q(@xmath38 ) , third isospin projection t@xmath25 , isospin t and strangeness s. according to table [ tab01 ] , mixed states are d@xmath8 , d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 from symmetric multiplets and d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 from antisymmetric multiplets . which mixed state belongs to the @xmath2 and which to the @xmath3 is arbitrary at present and , in fact , the physical particle may be some superposition of the two states .",
    "the same applies for mixed states from @xmath4 and @xmath39 .",
    "the flavor wave functions , requiring orthogonality between each state , are given in table [ tab02 ] .",
    "it is known that a meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark , but as can be seen from table [ tab02 ] , experimentally detected states d@xmath8(2317 ) and d@xmath8(2632 ) in addition to @xmath14 also have @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 combinations whose probability is determined by the square of the coefficient in front of each combination . in case of d@xmath10(2308 ) , besides @xmath43 there are also @xmath41 and @xmath42 combinations .",
    "these facts clearly indicate the tetraquark components in wave functions of the three mentioned states .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab06 ]    figure [ fig06 ] may be compared with figure 3 from ref . ,",
    "which was plotted for fermi - breit ( fb ) color - spin hfi from the constituent quark masses obtained in this way : @xmath13 was the result of a light meson fit , the mass difference @xmath12 - @xmath13 was taken to be 100 mev and @xmath44 is fitted so that the lightest tetraquark from the @xmath5 multiplet had equal mass as d@xmath8(2317 ) .",
    "this comparison shows that obtained tetraquark masses for both gr and fb hfi are similar , except for @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath3 mixed states .",
    "besides , fb hfi is causing additional splitting between @xmath35 ( d@xmath11 ) and @xmath37 .",
    "these dissimilarities are due to term @xmath45 in gr and @xmath46 in fb interaction ( f - flavor , c - color ) . from this comparison one can see that the forms of tetraquark spectra with fb and gr interaction are similar ,",
    "only they are shifted for some value .",
    "this is an important result which was not expected because fb is a color - spin and gr is a flavor - spin interaction .",
    "the results obtained from these two interactions confirm that both hfis give similar results for tetraquark masses .",
    "symmetry breaking.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the lightest @xmath47 scalars that are experimentally known are the @xmath48 ( 500 ) , @xmath49 ( 980 ) , @xmath50 ( 800 ) and the @xmath51 ( 980 ) .",
    "they form an su(3 ) flavor nonet .",
    "already in the seventies jaffe @xcite suggested the tetraquark structure of this scalar nonet and proposed a four quark bag model .",
    "their quark content is given in refs . and .",
    "it is shown @xcite that these mesons fit well in the tetraquark scheme .",
    "we considered them as four quark states and calculated their masses , which are given in table [ tab06 ] .",
    "as can be seen from table [ tab06 ] , gr hfi significantly reduces the theoretical masses of the light scalar tetraquarks and brings them closer to their experimental masses .",
    "this fact confirmes the conclusion from ref .",
    "about tetraquark nature of these light scalars .",
    "we have made a systematic analysis of the charm tetraquark states .",
    "weight diagrams , irreducible representations and flavor wave functions are shown and analyzed .",
    "detailed method of calculation is described .",
    "there are 27 different tetraquarks with c = 1 and with three light flavors .",
    "we calculated mass spectra and wave functions for all 27 states using gr hfi . among these states",
    "there are 11 cryptoexotic ( 3 d@xmath8 , 4 d@xmath9 , 4 d@xmath10 ) and 16 explicit exotic states . in the tetraquark model",
    "it is possible to identify d@xmath8(2317 ) and d@xmath8(2632 ) with two cryptoexotic states in tetraquark spectrum when glozman - riska hyperfine interaction is included .",
    "namely , explicit exotic states , as for instance isotriplet @xmath35 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , appear in the spectrum with the same masses ( i.e. at 2317 mev and at 2632 mev ) .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that d@xmath10(2308 ) is a tetraquark .",
    "then , there should be the other tetraquark partner of d@xmath10(2308 ) to form an isospin doublet with isospin t = 1/2 ( see table [ tab01 ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the recently discovered charm - strange meson d@xmath10(2308 ) , with unusual properties , could be a cryptoexotic tetraquark state @xmath55 .",
    "the tetraquark nature for scalar charmed mesons d@xmath8(2317 ) , d@xmath10(2308 ) and d@xmath8(2632 ) is confirmed by showing existence of the tetraquark component in their wave functions .",
    "we also gave estimates for masses of experimentally detected light scalars @xmath48 ( 500 ) , @xmath49 ( 980 ) , @xmath50 ( 800 ) and @xmath51 ( 980 ) and confirmed that they satisfactorily fit in the tetraquark scheme when gr hfi is included .",
    "if we compare masses with and without hyperfine interactions we can conclude that mass arrangement of tetraquark flavor multiplets depends almost entirely on the strong hyperfine interaction .",
    "we show that in both cases of hyperfine interaction ( fb and gr ) the lowest lying multiplet is @xmath4-plet , and the mixing and ordering of other states is similar in the two models .",
    "maybe , fb and gr are not the complete effective two - quark interactions , and because of that theoretical prediction is not the same as the experiment .",
    "we also showed for the first time wave functions and quark content for all predicted 27 quark states of @xmath0 combination .",
    "we obtained all masses using gr interaction with two fits and we showed that gr hfi gave similar results as fb interaction .",
    "more experimental searches for detection of other @xmath56 members especially those exotic ones are needed in the future ."
