    "<S> we consider the interference of two photons with different colors in the context of a hong - ou - mandel experiment , in which single photons enter each of the input ports of a beam splitter , and exit in the same , albeit undetermined , output port . </S>",

    "<S> we find scenarios in which one `` red '' and one `` blue '' photon enter the beam splitter , and either two red or two blue photons exit , but never one of each color . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the precise form of the active beam - splitter transformation determines in what way the spectral degrees of freedom of the input photons should be related to each other for perfect destructive interference of the different - color components in the output . </S>",
