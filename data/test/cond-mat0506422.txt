    "the phospholipid molecules that constitute the chief component of cellular plasma membranes spontaneously self - assemble to form bilayers when dissolved in water . these bilayers tend to stack to form multilayers , also known as _",
    "multilamellae_. at high lipid concentrations , the stable morphology consists of flat , stacked bilayers with quasi - long - range order @xcite . yet , under certain nonequilibrium conditions , the bilayers bend to form long - lived spherical multilamellae known as onions@xcite or nested cylindrical tubes called myelin figures or simply , myelins ( see fig.[fig : myelins_exp])@xcite , despite the additional penalty in curvature energy . the formation of myelins has been a mystery since their discovery more than 150 years ago@xcite .",
    "myelins offer a variety of potential applications such as encapsulation and controlled delivery of drugs@xcite .",
    "thus a better understanding of their formation and structure is desired .    in this paper",
    "we identify a type of constrained equilibrium that leads naturally to myelin formation .",
    "the simple geometrical mechanism proposed here offers a plausible and general explanation for the longstanding puzzle of myelin formation and has explicit implications about their internal makeup .",
    "we note that in contrast to the @xmath0-to-@xmath1-to-@xmath0 reentrant phase transition@xcite that involves topological changes , the formation of myelins in our system involves only geometrical changes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : exp ] we outline our experimental results of myelin formation . based on the experimental observations , we propose a model in sections [ sec : model ] and [ sec : instability ] to explain the formation of myelins in our experiment . in section [",
    "sec : permeation ] we investigate the effect of water permeation on our model . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the implications and limitations of our model .",
    "finally section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes our work .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present our model of myelin formation .",
    "therefore we only summarize our experimental results that are pertinent to the model .",
    "more complete description of the experiment will be given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "in our experiment we observe a drop of dilute suspension of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine ( dmpc ) bilayer vesicles in water as it evaporates@xcite ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) .",
    "the drop is heated to @xmath2c , above the chain - melting temperature of dmpc ( @xmath3c)@xcite . thus the bilayers are in the fluid state ( @xmath1 phase)@xcite .",
    "the evaporative flow creates a ring deposit of concentrated lipid around the drop s perimeter@xcite . from this deposit",
    "many pancake - like multilamellar disks develop and grow inward .",
    "as the disks grow , they undergo a shape transition to form myelins .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that materials , i.e. , lipid and water enter the disk - myelin complex mainly via its root embedded in the dry deposit region ( fig.[fig : exp])@xcite .",
    "if evaporation is halted , growth stops and the myelin is resorbed into its parent disk ; but the myelin s cylindrical morphology is retained during the resorption .",
    "this suggests that the disk - myelin complex is in quasi - equilibrium@xcite , and hence free energy analysis is applicable to the disk - to - myelin shape transition .",
    "in this section and the next one , we present a theory to account for the myelin formation , i.e. , the disk - to - myelin shape transition , observed in our experiment ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) .",
    "we will show that the formation of myelins can be favorable because their cylindrical form results in a larger bilayer repeat spacing ( i.e. , separation between bilayers ) and hence lower inter - bilayer repulsion than flat multilamellae .",
    "we postulate that ( * a * ) the number of bilayers is unchanged during the shape transition , and ( * b * ) the bilayers can exchange materials , i.e. , lipid and water , freely to achieve quasi - equilibrium@xcite . the number of bilayers , denoted by @xmath4 , is unlikely to change on the time scale of the shape transition , which is about 1 second .",
    "the bilayers may exchange materials via defects such as screw dislocations@xcite .",
    "the free energy includes a curvature energy favoring flat bilayers@xcite and a repulsion between bilayers@xcite .",
    "the curvature energy of a bilayer of area @xmath5 takes the form of ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bending stiffness , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the principal curvatures , and @xmath10 is the spontaneous curvature@xcite .",
    "the bending stiffness @xmath11 for dmpc bilayers@xcite .",
    "( however , ref.@xcite gives a smaller value of @xmath7 . ) in our experiment we expect @xmath12 .",
    "postulate ( * a * ) implies that the topology of the disk - myelin complex does not change in the shape transition .",
    "therefore we can neglect the gaussian curvature contributions according to the gauss - bonnet theorem@xcite . with ( [ eqn : f^c ] ) the curvature energy of a myelin consisting of @xmath4 concentric , uniformly spaced bilayer cylinders",
    "is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the myelin length and @xmath15 the bilayer repeat spacing ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radii of the outermost and innermost cylinders respectively .",
    "the total bilayer area @xmath18 by construction @xmath19 in this paper we set ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) @xmath20 for convenience , and we only consider myelins of large aspect ratios , i.e. , @xmath21 , so that the end caps are negligible .    the repulsion between bilayers",
    "is determined experimentally : the authors of @xcite found that their pressure data were well represented as the sum of an exponentially falling hydration force plus a van der waals attraction ( table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "our estimates of inter - bilayer interaction energy use this functional form . specifically , given water layer thickness @xmath22 and bilayer repeat spacing @xmath23 ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) , the inter - bilayer pressure @xmath24 where the hydration pressure @xmath25 ,    \\label{eqn : p_1}\\ ] ] and the van der waals attraction @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{eqn : p_2}\\ ] ] the inter - bilayer interaction energy per unit bilayer area is therefore equal to @xmath27 in this paper the bilayer thickness @xmath28 is taken to be constant ( see fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath29dyne/@xmath30 and @xmath31 nm for dmpc bilayers , and the hamaker coefficient @xmath32 is set to @xmath33j in this paper@xcite .",
    "when the bilayers are curved , this energy is in principle altered . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we argue that such corrections are negligible in the case of interest .",
    "postulate ( * b * ) proposed at the beginning of the section implies that the important external parameters for determining the free energies are the amount of lipid and that of water in the disk - myelin complex . under moderate external pressure ,",
    "the bilayer thickness @xmath28 is approximately constant and , moreover , both lipid bilayers and water are virtually incompressible ( fig.[fig : d - to - m])@xcite .",
    "this means we can describe the amount of lipid by the total area @xmath5 of all the bilayers , which is measured at the bilayer s mid - surface ( s in fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) .",
    "similarly , the total amount of lipid plus water is equivalent to the total volume @xmath34 of the complex .    given the total bilayer area @xmath5 , volume @xmath34 , and the number of bilayers @xmath4 , the disk - myelin complex is internally confined . in this case",
    "the lipid concentration @xmath35 determines the bilayer repeat spacing and thus the inter - bilayer repulsion , as shown in the next section .",
    "we now illustrate how a sufficiently large lipid concentration , i.e. , area - to - volume ratio @xmath35 , can make a multi - lamellar disk unstable to myelin formation .",
    "we consider a large but thin disk composed of @xmath4 nested bilayer disks , with uniform bilayer repeat spacing @xmath36 , volume @xmath34 , and total bilayer area @xmath5 . because the disk is large and thin ,",
    "its rim part is negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : d - to - m ] shows the example with @xmath37 . if the area of each bilayer is denoted by @xmath38 , then the total area @xmath39 and the total volume @xmath40 .",
    "thus the repeat spacing @xmath41 this @xmath36 determines the inter - bilayer interaction energy ( see ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) ) . for these flat bilayers , the curvature energy ( [ eqn : f^c ] )",
    "is arbitrarily small .    to show the instability of this disk",
    ", we convert it into a myelin composed of @xmath4 concentric and uniformly spaced cylindrical bilayers , keeping both @xmath34 and @xmath5 fixed ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) . using ( [ eqn : a_m ] ) , ( [ eqn : r_o ] ) and ( [ eqn : r_i ] ) the bilayer area @xmath42 while the myelin volume @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath44 so that the myelin repeat spacing @xmath45 this @xmath15 determines the inter - bilayer interaction energy of the myelin ( see ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) ) . with ( [ eqn : r_o ] ) and ( [ eqn : r_i ] )",
    "its curvature energy ( [ eqn : f^c_m ] ) can be written as @xmath46 because the myelin has a larger repeat spacing , it has a lower repulsion energy than the disk .",
    "if the decrease in the repulsion energy can compensate for the myelin s curvature energy ( see ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) and ( [ eqn : f^c_m1 ] ) ) , the myelin , rather than the disk , becomes the thermodynamically more stable morphology .",
    "here we define a threshold inter - bilayer pressure @xmath47 , above which the disk becomes unstable against myelin formation .",
    "namely , @xmath47 is the pressure at which the decrease in the inter - bilayer repulsion energy due to the disk - to - myelin transition is equal to the curvature energy of the myelin .",
    "although the fractional change in spacing @xmath48 is tiny when @xmath49 , the reduction in the total repulsion energy is proportional to @xmath4 , and therefore the effect of spacing increase can still be significant , as demonstrated by the example below .",
    "since the inter - bilayer pressure increases rapidly with decreased repeat spacing ( [ eqn : p ] ) , a multilamellar disk with modest dehydration can easily have enough repulsion to become unstable .",
    "a typical disk observed in the experiment should be somewhat dehydrated because part of it is in the dry deposit region ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) .",
    "the disk thickness is observed to be about 2.5 @xmath50m@xcite . given the equilibrium spacing@xcite , we infer the number @xmath4 of nested bilayer disks to be approximately 200 .",
    "taking @xmath51 and using the measured bending stiffness ( [ eqn : kappa_c ] ) and inter - bilayer repulsion ( [ eqn : p ] ) for these dmpc bilayers@xcite , our model predicts that the energy of the disk becomes larger than that of the myelin when the dehydration exceeds 2.1% , i.e. , a 2.1% decrease in the repeat spacing from the equilibrium value of 6.22nm@xcite .",
    "the inter - bilayer pressure @xmath52 0.32atm at such dehydration ( [ eqn : p ] ) .",
    "the myelin converted from this disk has a repeat spacing about 1.9% less than the equilibrium value and an inter - bilayer pressure @xmath53 of about 0.3atm , with the van der waals attraction @xmath54 0.013atm ( [ eqn : p_2 ] ) .",
    "since the difference between the repeat spacings , @xmath36 and @xmath15 , is tiny , the myelin diameter is nearly identical with the thickness of the parent disk ; this is consistent with our experimental observations@xcite .",
    "here we assume that the threshold pressure @xmath47 is sufficiently low so that the bilayer thickness @xmath28 is unchanged during the shape transformation ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) . with the experimental data shown in fig.1 of @xcite",
    ", our result of @xmath55 0.32atm suggests that a constant @xmath28 is indeed a fair approximation .    based on our model",
    "we propose the following scenario to explain the myelin formation in our experiment ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) : as water evaporates , lipid and water enter the disk , and hence both @xmath5 and @xmath34 increase .",
    "because the contact line gradually moves inward due to water evaporation , the disk becomes more and more dehydrated , i.e. , the lipid concentration @xmath35 increases .",
    "an increase in @xmath35 leads to a decrease in the repeat spacing @xmath36 ( [ eqn : d_d ] ) and thus an increase in the inter - bilayer repulsion ( [ eqn : p ] ) .",
    "the repeat spacing keeps decreasing until a threshold , below which the disk is unstable and a myelin with a larger spacing grows out of it in order to lower the free energy .",
    "the above simple example has a large pressure difference @xmath56 0.3atm between the inside and outside of the disk - myelin complex",
    ". this pressure might induce sufficient water permeation through the bilayers to reduce the dehydration and restore the stability of the disk morphology , thus invalidating our model . in the following",
    "we perform a self - consistency check to show this is not the case : in practice the system should be in a steady state , where the pressure drop occurs across a significant fraction of the complex .",
    "this suggests that the pressure difference across a bilayer in the complex of figure [ fig : exp ] is about @xmath57atm .",
    "the water permeability coefficients @xmath58 for typical phosphatidylcholine bilayers are known to be 30 - 100 @xmath50m / s@xcite . assuming the validity of the solubility - diffusion mechanism@xcite , the volume flux of water across a bilayer of area @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the pressure difference across the bilayer , @xmath62@xmath63/mole , the partial molar volume of water , @xmath64 the gas constant and @xmath65 the temperature . using permeability coefficient @xmath66 m/s and assuming that water enters the complex only via permeation and spreads evenly into all water layers , we estimate that permeation causes each water layer to swell at the rate of @xmath67nm / s , or equivalently , 1.8% of the equilibrium spacing per minute ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) .",
    "given the disk diameter @xmath68 m and the swelling rate @xmath69 , the flux of water permeating into the disk part of the complex is @xmath70 which only accounts for a small portion of the total water influx @xmath71 inferred from the observed myelin growth rate @xmath72 m/s ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) .",
    "the growth of myelins implies that both the bilayer area @xmath5 and volume @xmath34 of the complex increase with time .",
    "our model , nevertheless , requires that the concentration @xmath35 is maintained at a sufficiently high level so that the disk is always unstable against the formation of myelins . since @xmath73 ,",
    "the effect of water permeation is too weak to cause any significant decrease in @xmath35 and thus to compromise the proposed mechanism for myelin formation . by the same token",
    ", the flux of water permeating into a myelin in figure [ fig : exp ] is given by @xmath74 where the myelin length @xmath14 is in @xmath50 m and the myelin diameter is set to @xmath75 m .",
    "now we can define a critical myelin length @xmath76 using the equation @xmath77 when the myelin length @xmath78 , our mechanism for myelin formation no longer holds because the flux due to water permeation , @xmath79 exceeds the total influx @xmath80 and thus the concentration @xmath35 must decrease , restoring the stability of the disk morphology .",
    "given @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 calculated above , @xmath76 is about @xmath83 m . in figure",
    "[ fig : exp ] the lengths of all the myelins are less than @xmath76 , which means our model for myelin formation can be applied to this system with self - consistency .",
    "the model presented in sections [ sec : model ] and [ sec : instability ] offers a simple geometrical explanation for the formation of myelins in our experiment : the bilayer repeat spacing increases and therefore the inter - bilayer repulsion decreases when a multilamellar disk is transformed into a myelin under the constraints of fixed volume , bilayer area , and number of bilayers ( see ( [ eqn : d_d ] ) and ( [ eqn : d_m ] ) ) .",
    "if the lipid concentration is sufficiently high , the decrease in the inter - bilayer repulsion energy is greater than the curvature energy of the myelin , and thus the disk is unstable against myelin formation .",
    "our model can be thought of as a minimal model for myelin formation , from which more sophisticated models can be constructed . for systems with non - negligible disk perimeter and myelin end - caps , the proposed geometrical mechanism still holds , but the expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath15",
    "are no longer as simple as ( [ eqn : d_d ] ) and ( [ eqn : d_m ] ) , respectively@xcite . in the following",
    "we will discuss the limitations as well as the implications of our model .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we impose two artificial ( i.e. , non - physical ) constraints on the myelin geometry in order to illustrate the geometrical mechanism that destabilizes the disk : the constituent bilayer cylinders of a myelin are uniformly spaced , and the radius @xmath84 ( equation ( [ eqn : r_i ] ) ) . with these two constraints the calculations of the energies ( [ eqn : f^c_m ] ) and ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) are greatly simplified .",
    "freeing these two constraints would not weaken our proposed mechanism for myelin formation in that allowing @xmath15 to be non - uniform or @xmath17 to vary can only lower the myelin energy further .",
    "we will investigate the myelin structure without these two constraints in another work@xcite .",
    "in our model we neglect the thermal undulations of bilayers@xcite ( fig.[fig : d - to - m ] ) .",
    "the reasons are twofold : first , the persistence length@xcite of dmpc bilayers is much larger than any lengths of the disk - myelin complexes observed in our experiment ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) .",
    "this means the bilayers are stiff , and thus their undulations should be negligible . secondly ,",
    "although bilayer thermal undulations decrease the bending stiffness @xmath7 ( [ eqn : kappa_c])@xcite and increase the inter - bilayer pressure @xmath53 ( [ eqn : p ] ) ( [ eqn : p_1])@xcite . ] , these effects , however , would only help destabilize the disk and therefore would not invalidate our model .",
    "moreover , the threshold pressure @xmath47 defined in section [ sec : instability ] is insensitive to bilayer undulations , as shown below : the decrease in the inter - bilayer repulsion energy due to the disk - to - myelin transition can be approximated with @xmath85 ( see ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) and ( [ eqn : frac_d ] ) ) . by definition @xmath47 satisfies ( see ( [ eqn : f^c_m])([eqn : r_i ] ) , and ( [ eqn : d_m ] ) ) @xmath86 using @xmath51 and equation ( [ eqn : kappa_c ] ) , and assuming @xmath36 is about equal to the equilibrium value of 6.22 nm for dmpc bilayers ( section [ sec : instability ] ) , the above equation yields the threshold pressure @xmath87atm regardless of bilayer undulations .",
    "this estimate of @xmath47 is close to the result , 0.32atm , obtained in section [ sec : instability ] . in the above calculation we neglect the weak dependence of @xmath7 on bilayer undulations@xcite .",
    "based on the experimental evidence described in section [ sec : exp ] , we postulate that the bilayers can exchange materials through defects to reach quasi - equilibrium ( postulate ( * b * ) in section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "this postulate is important in our model in that it greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "therefore the formation of defects in systems like ours deserve more detailed investigation@xcite .",
    "our theory says nothing about how the myelin size is determined .",
    "this size appears to be determined by pre - existing structure in the dry lipid from which the disk and myelins grow ( fig.[fig : exp ] ) .",
    "however , our theory does suggest consequences of changes in size : since the bilayer repeat spacing is of the order of the equilibrium spacing , the overall diameter of the myelin tube is proportional to the number of bilayers @xmath4 .",
    "we see from equation ( [ eqn : p_th ] ) that the threshold pressure @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath88 for large @xmath4 .",
    "thus an increase in the myelin diameter should produce a roughly proportionate decrease in the internal pressure .",
    "our analysis of inter - bilayer interaction energy assumes that the bilayers are flat .",
    "however , in the myelin structure the bilayers are curved .",
    "this in principle induces a correction to the interaction energy per unit area ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) . in the following",
    "we show that this correction is negligible when the number of bilayers @xmath49 : equations ( [ eqn : a_m])([eqn : r_i ] ) , ( [ eqn : p_1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : frac_d ] ) imply that the net change of the interaction energy due to the spacing increase is approximately @xmath89 using equation ( [ eqn : p_1 ] ) the interaction energy density ( [ eqn : repulsion ] ) of two adjacent bilayer cylinders of radii @xmath90 in a myelin is about @xmath91 ,      \\label{eqn : c_correct}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless prefactor @xmath92 is expected to be of order 1 .",
    "the correction term @xmath93 results from the bilayer curvature @xmath94 .",
    "terms of order @xmath95 would depend on the direction of curvature , and are thus ruled out by symmetry . with ( [ eqn : r_o ] ) , ( [ eqn : r_i ] ) and ( [ eqn : c_correct ] ) the correction to the inter - bilayer interaction energy of a myelin due to nonzero bilayer curvatures",
    "is given by @xmath96 where the decay length @xmath97 ( [ eqn : p_1 ] ) , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the radius and area of the @xmath100-th bilayer cylinder of the myelin , respectively .",
    "the above estimates suggest that the curvature effect ( [ eqn : secondary ] ) is negligible compared to our main effect ( [ eqn : main ] ) when @xmath101 .    in section [ sec : instability ]",
    "we show that the repeat spacing increases when an @xmath4-bilayer disk is transformed into an @xmath4-bilayer myelin ( see ( [ eqn : d_d ] ) and ( [ eqn : d_m ] ) ) . the spacing would increase further if the myelin were converted into concentric spheres or onions@xcite also composed of @xmath4 uniformly spaced bilayers . specifically ,",
    "the onion spacing @xmath102 for @xmath49 .",
    "this suggests that our model might help understand the formation of onions observed in @xcite and @xcite . in our experiment",
    "( fig.[fig : exp ] ) their formation is , however , kinetically blocked because they can not form continuously from a disk or myelin . furthermore , the relative stability of onions is also influenced by the gaussian bending stiffness@xcite , since the transformation from a disk or myelin to onions changes the topology@xcite .",
    "although our model is invented mainly to account for the disk - to - myelin transition shown in fig.[fig : exp ] , it also sheds some light on the formation of myelins observed in contact experiments ( see fig.[fig : myelins_exp])@xcite : in a contact experiment water is brought into contact with concentrated surfactant . immediately after contact , the surfactant molecules self - organize to form many multilamellae at the interface@xcite .",
    "these multilamellae should have high lipid concentrations , and therefore their inter - bilayer interaction is strongly repulsive . as a result , the bilayers along the contact interface would curve to form myelinic structures .",
    "in this paper we propose a geometrical mechanism to account for the formation of myelins : in short , if a stack of flat bilayers is internally confined and the inter - bilayer interaction is repulsive , geometrical packing alone can lead to myelin formation .",
    "we believe this geometric mechanism can help explain why myelins form in a variety of experiments@xcite , where internal confinement and inter - bilayer repulsion also appear to play important roles .",
    "our findings may help develop techniques in controlled growth of myelin or onion structures , which have potential applications in encapsulation and drug delivery@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our model , by its very nature , addresses only the equilibrium aspect of myelin formation .",

    "<S> by evaporating a drop of lipid dispersion we generate the myelin morphology often seen in dissolving surfactant powders . </S>",
    "<S> we explain these puzzling nonequilibrium structures using a geometric argument : the bilayer repeat spacing increases and thus the repulsion between bilayers decreases when a multilamellar disk is converted into a myelin without gain or loss of material and with number of bilayers unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> sufficient reduction in bilayer repulsion can compensate for the cost in curvature energy , leading to a net stability of the myelin structure . </S>",
