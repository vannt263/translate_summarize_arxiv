    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) arise from relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "relativistic motion , with lorentz factor of greater than @xmath10 is necessary in order to resolve the `` compactness problem '' . on the other hand ,",
    "the evidence of the jet collimation has been derived by the wave - length - independent achromatic break in the observed afterglow light curve .",
    "the jet opening half - angle has been actually measured in this context for bursts with successfully measured redshifts and jet break times .",
    "however , the small number of samples prevents us from discussing the statistical properties of the opening angle distribution .",
    "we have not yet known the maximum and minimum value of the opening angle as well as the slope of the distribution function well @xcite .",
    "these quantities are very important to argue the grb rate , the energetics , the nature of progenitors , and so on .",
    "there is a correlation between the rest - frame spectral peak energy @xmath0 and the isotropic equivalent @xmath1-ray energy @xmath11 of grbs called the amati relation @xcite .",
    "several authors have argued theoretical interpretations of the relation @xcite . while @xcite argued against the amati relation because @xmath1240% of 751 batse grbs do not have the solution to the undetermined redshift under the amati relation and clear outliers such as grb  980425 and grb  031203 exist .",
    "a similar argument against the amati relation has also been made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued against @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "they used 442 bright batse grbs with good statistics and pseudo redshift from the lag - luminosity relation @xcite and obtained the amati relation with the slightly different power law index and the larger scatter than the original one .",
    "they found that the chance probability of the revised amati relation is @xmath13 .",
    "similar analysis can be also seen in @xcite . as for outliers",
    ", @xcite argued that if the intrinsic @xmath0 of grb  980425 is 24  mev similar to grb990123 and the viewing angle is @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath1 being the jet opening half - angle and the gamma factor of the jet , the observed @xmath11 and @xmath0 of grb  980425 can be reproduced .",
    "if we locate grb  980425 at the distance larger than 800  mpc , the event is not observed .",
    "hence , grb  980425-like events are not included in the bright batse grbs .",
    "similar arguments have been also done for grb  031203 @xcite .",
    "note here that in the classification of _ hete-2 _ , grb  980425 and grb  031203 are x - ray rich grbs .",
    "recently , similar relations to the amati one with the tighter correlation have been found . @xcite",
    "have shown that for 16 grbs with known redshifts detected by batse and _ bepposax _ , there is a tight positive correlation between @xmath0 and the peak luminosity ( @xmath0@xmath16 relation ) .",
    "the chance probability is extremely low @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite called the relation as the yonetoku relation and checked the validity of the relation using 442 bright grbs with the pseudo redshift and confirmed the relation with the same power law index within the error in the original yonetoku relation .",
    "they found that the chance probability of the yonetoku relation is @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite used the yonetoku relation as the redshift indicator for 689 grb samples without known redshift , and derived the grb formation rate . on the other hand , for 15 grbs detected by batse , _ bepposax _ and _ hete-2 _ with measured redshift and opening half - angle @xmath15 , @xcite found that @xmath0 correlates with the collimation - corrected @xmath1-ray energy @xmath19 .",
    "we call the relation as the ghirlanda relation . the @xmath20-@xmath21 diagram of grbs may correspond to the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram of stars .",
    "then the yonetoku as well as the ghirlanda relations correspond to the main - sequence where stars cluster around a single curve determined by the mass of the star .",
    "this suggests the existence of a certain parameter that controls grbs like the mass of the star in the hr diagram . in the hr diagram",
    "the outliers of the main sequence exist such as red giants and white dwarfs .",
    "we know the physical reasons for the existence of these outliers so that they do not refute the main sequence relation . in the yonetoku and the ghirlanda relations also outliers exist for which we will know the physical reasons in future as suggested in @xcite .    in this letter , we show that the yonetoku and the ghirlanda relations can be used to estimate the opening half - angle of the relativistic jet of grbs .",
    "main advantage of our jet opening half - angle estimator is that the opening angle can be calculated only from the information of the prompt emission .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "angle ] , using the yonetoku and ghirlanda relations , we derive an empirical formula to estimate the opening half - angle and discuss its validity . using the estimator",
    ", we derive the distribution of opening half - angle of batse - triggered bursts in section  [ sec : distribution ] . section  [ sec : disc ] is devoted to discussions .",
    "usually the jet opening half - angle is estimated only when both the redshift and the achromatic break time in the afterglow light curve are measured . under the simple assumption of a uniform ambient matter distribution of number density @xmath22 , the jet opening half - angle is estimated as @xmath23^{3/8}(n_0\\eta_\\gamma/\\eiso)^{1/8}~~ , \\label{eq : break}\\ ] ] where @xmath24  erg , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the jet break time in days and the efficiency of the fireball in converting the energy in the ejecta into @xmath1-rays , respectively @xcite .",
    "however continuous follow - up observations are required to measure the achromatic jet - break time , and moreover these kinds of observations are realized only for the bright afterglows so that it is hard to measure the opening half - angle for large amount of grbs in this method .",
    "we propose here a different method to estimate the opening half - angle using only informations of the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "let us assume that the rest - frame spectral peak energy @xmath0 , the peak luminosity @xmath16 , the isotropic equivalent @xmath1-ray energy @xmath11 , the jet opening - half angle @xmath15 , and the collimation - corrected energy @xmath19 satisfy the yonetoku and the ghirlanda relations as @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes @xmath31 in cgs units @xcite . from equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we have , @xmath32 from the observed @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we can determine the redshift under the yonetoku relation and the given cosmological parameter as in @xcite .",
    "then @xmath11 can be computed using the observed fluence .",
    "therefore , only from the information of the prompt gamma - ray emission , we can estimate the jet opening half - angle for each grb .",
    "this method has a strong advantage compared with the jet - break measurement in afterglows since we can use the large number of batse grbs data .    to show the validity of our method , in figure  [ fig : angle_compare ] , we compare @xmath33 estimated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : break ] ) with @xmath15 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : angle ] ) for grbs with measured redshift and jet break time .",
    "it is found that there exists a positive correlation with the linear correlation coefficient including weighting factor is 0.760 with 13 degree of freedom ( excluding the lower and upper limit samples ) , which corresponds to the chance probability of @xmath34 .",
    "their differences from the linear function ( equivalent line ) are within a factor of 2 .",
    "although we had better use the word `` the pseudo jet opening half - angle '' for the half - angle from equation ( 4 ) , we simply use the opening half - angle in this letter for convenience .     estimated by eq .",

    "we used the same data set of 689 long grbs published in @xcite to measure the distribution function , @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the jet opening half - angle and @xmath36 is the relative number of the jet with the opening half - angle between @xmath15 and @xmath37 . in order to have a better signal - to - noise ratio in our analyses , we selected 605 grbs with the flux greater than @xmath38 .",
    "having obtained the observed peak flux and the spectral indices as well as the @xmath39 , the redshift is estimated using the yonetoku relation for each event @xcite .",
    "then , we can estimate @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "hence @xmath15 is also calculated by equation  ( [ eq : angle ] ) .",
    "the empirical @xmath15 estimator shown in equation  ( [ eq : angle ] ) depends on two parameters ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this fact means that the two different types of selection effects are mixed . to avoid such doubly truncation effects",
    ", we manually set a truncation as the @xmath42 at the rest frame of grbs . in this case , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 are limited only by the peak flux , so we can deal with the data as the simply truncated one .",
    "figure  [ fig : z_angle ] shows the distribution of the derived jet opening half - angle as a function of the redshift .",

    "the opening angles measured from the jet - break time in the optical afterglow are also plot on the same figure as squares and arrows .",
    ", width=317 ]    first , we estimate the opening half - angle evolution , which is the redshift dependence of @xmath35 , from the @xmath46 distribution shown in figure  [ fig : z_angle ] .",
    "the data correlation degree in the flux limited samples are calculated by so called @xmath47-statistical method which is very similar to the kendell s @xmath47 statistics . to refer to the previous works @xcite , we assume the functional form of @xmath35 evolution as @xmath48 , and calculate the data correlation degree for each @xmath49 value . in figure",
    "[ fig : index - tau ] , we show the @xmath50 correlation as a function of index @xmath49 .",
    "no @xmath43 evolution is rejected about 6 sigma confidence level .",
    "when we assume the case of @xmath51 , @xmath43 becomes independent of the redshift .",
    "in other words , @xmath43 evolution of @xmath52 is hidden in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "-statistical method .",
    "when we assume @xmath43 evolution as the function of @xmath48 , @xmath51 is the best value .",
    "we also show 3  sigma upper and lower bound of the index as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "no evolution of @xmath43 was rejected about 6  @xmath55 confidence .",
    ", width=317 ]    next , we derive the opening half - angle distribution . one possible method ( non - parametric method ) developed by @xcite is applied in this analysis .",
    "we define @xmath56 which is equivalent to the evolution - removed opening half - angle .",
    "then the observed data randomly distributes in the @xmath57 plane , so we can easily assume the missing data caused by the flux limit .",
    "strictly speaking , for high - redshift grbs ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) , the observed fluence may be estimated as the lower value because there may be missing photons behind the background level .",
    "on the other hand , the peak flux may be correctly estimated .",
    "hence derived opening half - angles for high-@xmath59 events may be larger than the actual values . in order to avoid such confusion ,",
    "we consider 430 events within the estimated redshifts of less than 4.5 .",
    "additional merit is that the k - correction factor can be neglected .",
    "the differential @xmath60 distribution @xmath61 which corresponds to one at @xmath62 , is shown in figure  [ fig : result ] .",
    "if one would like to obtain the @xmath43 distribution at each redshift , it is roughly estimated as @xmath63 .",
    "distribution at @xmath64 of the grbs observed with batse detector .",
    ", width=317 ]    the opening half - angle distribution @xmath61 is based on the number of event detected by batse .",
    "the chance probability to observe narrowly collimated events are much lower than that of the wide opening half - angle events due to the geometrical effect .",
    "therefore , we have to take into account the correction of @xmath65 when we argue the true probability density function . in figure",
    "[ fig : result2 ] , we show the true opening half - angle distribution .",
    "it can be fitted by the power - law form in the range @xmath66  radian as @xmath67 .",
    "clear cut off at @xmath68  rad can be seen .",
    "@xcite obtained the opening half - angle distribution using the ghirlanda relation and the amati relation .",
    "the result looks like a log - normal one .",
    "we also tried to fit a log - normal one .",
    "we obtained acceptable results with the mean @xmath69 ( 0.07  radian ) and the standard deviation @xmath70 ( 0.040.12  radian ) .",
    "however the data distribution is asymmetric in the logarithmic horizontal scale as shown in figure  [ fig : result2 ] .",
    "to say the power law distribution with cut - offs is better than the log - normal one , we have to confirm that the cut - off at @xmath71 exists .",
    "however we can not conclude the existence because of the large errors in the small @xmath43 region .    .",
    "when we adopt the power - law model for the region @xmath72  radian , we obtain the best result of @xmath67 with 90  % confidence level .",
    ", width=317 ]    from the distribution function we found the beaming correction for the rate of grbs @xmath6 at @xmath64 by computing @xmath73 .",
    "this rate is about factor of 4 larger than that obtained by @xcite using a different method , while @xcite obtained this correction @xmath12 520 using the same method with smaller number of samples .",
    "since the lower cut - off of the distribution @xmath74 are similar for both cases , the difference comes from the higher power law index @xmath75 of @xcite . since the number of grbs is much smaller in their analysis , observational biases of the smaller samples of larger opening half - angle causes the steeper power law . adopting the local grb rate of @xmath76  gpc@xmath77yr@xmath8 @xcite",
    ", we obtain the true rate of grb as @xmath78  gpc@xmath77yr@xmath8 which means @xmath7  yr@xmath8galaxy@xmath8 with the number density of the galaxy being @xmath79  galaxy  mpc@xmath77 .",
    "since the rate of type ib / c supernovae is @xmath80  yr@xmath8galaxy@xmath8 @xcite , only one in @xmath9  type  ib / c supernovae becomes grb if grb is the peculiar type  ib / c supernova .",
    "we present an empirical opening half - angle estimator that is inferred from the yonetoku and the ghirlanda relations .",
    "our method requires only the data of prompt emission , which is different from the standard method using the break in the afterglow light curve and the redshift . using the empirical opening angle estimator ,",
    "we have derived the opening angle distribution of grbs .",
    "the distribution can be fitted by the power - law form in the range @xmath81  rad as @xmath82 .",
    "the cut off at @xmath83  rad can be seen . in the uniform jet model of grbs",
    ", this means that the distribution function happens to be @xmath84 .",
    "the other possibility is the structured jet model . in the original version of the universal structured jet model @xcite ,",
    "the energy per unit solid angle is in proportion to @xmath84 .",
    "the lower and upper angle cutoff exist and the jet structure is essentially the same between the lower and the upper cutoff , which is the origin of the name `` structured '' jet .",
    "the viewing angle corresponds to the jet opening angle in the structured jet model so that we need to argue observationally what will be the opening angle distribution of the structured jet @xcite .",
    "if all bursts were observable , the distribution would be uniform per unit solid angle and @xmath85 .",
    "however , @xmath11 for the smaller viewing angle is brighter by a factor of @xmath5 so that the maximum observable distance is larger by a factor of @xmath86 which contains a volume larger than @xmath87",
    ". then we have @xmath88 which is compatible with the result in the present paper .",
    "especially our fig .",
    "5 looks like fig .  3 of @xcite with appropriate parameters .",
    "the evolution effect found in the present paper means that the jet opening half - angle becomes narrower for larger redshift .",
    "one possible qualitative explanation is that this is due to the metal dependence of the progenitors . since the metalicity of the star decreases as a function of the redshift",
    ", it is expected that the mass loss of the stars decreases as a function of the redshift if the mass loss is derived by the line absorption of photons in the atmosphere of the stars .",
    "this suggests that for high redshift progenitors of grbs , the mass of the envelope is larger so that only the sharper jet can punch a hole in the envelope of the progenitor star .",
    "in this paper , when we calculate the true opening half - angle distribution , we implicitly assumed that the jet emission can be seen only when the jet is seen on - axis . in reality , effects of off - axis viewing grbs might be important @xcite .",
    "when the contributions of off - axis emission is considered , true distribution may be modified",
    ". however , the beaming correction from off - axis effects is important only for @xmath89 because of the relativistic beaming effect @xcite .",
