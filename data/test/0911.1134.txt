    "as the large hadron collider starts operation , the search for supersymmetry reaches the interesting stage at which candidate models for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) may be definitively tested . in order to do this it is necessary to quantify the viable range of the susyparameters , and in particular limit the mass scale of the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "the bounds on the masses of supersymmetric states come most sensitively from the requirement that supersymmetry solves the hierarchy problem , i.e. it ensures that the electroweak breaking scale is consistent with radiative corrections without undue fine tuning .",
    "fine tuning @xcite-@xcite is a measure of the probability of unnatural cancellations between soft susy  breaking terms in the determination of the electroweak breaking scale after including quantum corrections and experimental constraints .",
    "the lepconstraints have already placed susy  under some pressure as the fine tuning is found to be quite large .",
    "the reason for this is largely due to the lep bound on the mass of the lightest higgs mass , @xmath5 because satisfying it requires large radiative corrections that depend logarithmically on the mass of the top squarks and this in turn requires large stop masses and hence large supersymmetry breaking soft terms .",
    "however , even in the simplest implementations of susy , there is still a significant area of parameter space to explore and it is of importance to provide a quantitative measure of what needs to be done to fully test susy .    in this paper",
    "we shall use the fine tuning measure , @xmath6 , to quantify fine tuning .",
    "the measure determines the cancellation needed between the independent terms contributing to the electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum expectation value and provides an intuitively reasonable way of quantifying fine tuning .",
    "of course it is necessary to supplement this by imposing an upper bound for @xmath6 beyond which fine tuning is unacceptable and this is a subjective judgement .",
    "for the most part we will just display the range of fine tuning found without imposing such a cut off , except when assessing whether the lhc will be able fully to test the model . as we shall discuss",
    "the fine tuning measure allows one to quantify the significance of individual measurements in testing susy over the full parameter space and so is useful in correlating the various measurements relevant to susysearches .",
    "it also allows us to determine the most important measurements for testing susy at the lhc .    in order to illustrate the usefulness of the fine tuning analysis we will study in detail the constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( cmssm ) which is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm with a restricted set of susy  breaking soft terms .",
    "we later comment on the effect of relaxing this assumption and on other effects beyond cmssm .",
    "we compute @xmath6 to two - loop order , using the results of @xcite-@xcite and present a scan of the full cmssm parameter space compatible with current experimental and theoretical constraints . in particular we require :    * radiative generation of electroweak symmetry breaking . * no colour / charge breaking vacua . * consistency with current experimental bounds on superpartner masses , electroweak precision data , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and anomalous magnetic moment constraints . * a radiatively corrected sm - like higgs mass in agreement with the current lepii bound on @xmath9 . * consistency with the thermal relic density constraint .",
    "we start with the form of the scalar potential responsible for electroweak breaking . with the standard two - higgs doublet notation , it is given by @xmath10 & ~+~\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\lambda_{1}\\,|h_{1}|^{4}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\lambda_{2 } \\,|h_{2}|^{4}+\\lambda_{3}\\,|h_{1}|^{2}\\,|h_{2}|^{2}\\,+\\lambda_{4}\\,|h_{1 } \\cdot h_{2}|^{2 }   \\notag \\\\[5pt ] & ~+~\\bigg[\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\lambda_{5}\\,\\,(h_{1}\\cdot h_{2})^{2}+\\lambda _ { 6}\\,\\,|h_{1}|^{2}\\,(h_{1}\\cdot h_{2})+\\lambda_{7}\\,\\,|h_{2}|^{2}\\,(h_{1}\\cdot h_{2})+h.c.\\bigg ] \\label{2hdm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the assumption that at the uv scale @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .    the couplings @xmath13 and the soft masses receive one- and two - loop corrections that for the mssm are found in @xcite .",
    "we shall use these results to evaluate the overall amount of fine - tuning of the electroweak scale . to this purpose",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath14 \\lambda & = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}^{{}}}{2}\\,\\cos^{4}\\beta+\\frac{\\lambda_{2}^ { { } } } { 2}\\,\\sin^{4}\\beta+\\frac{(\\lambda_{3}^{{}}+\\lambda_{4}^{{}}+\\lambda_{5})}{4 } \\,\\sin^{2}2\\beta+\\sin2\\beta\\left ( \\lambda_{6}^{{}}\\cos^{2}\\beta + \\lambda_{7}^{{}}\\sin^{2}\\beta\\right )   \\label{ml}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    minimisation of @xmath15 gives @xmath16    which fixes @xmath17 and @xmath18 as functions of the mssm bare parameters .",
    "the fine - tuning measure , @xmath6 , is defined by @xcite @xmath19 where all @xmath20 are input parameters at the uv scale , in the standard mssm notation coming from the uncertainty in the top yukawa coupling and the strong coupling . using the modified definition  @xcite of @xmath6 appropriate to measured parameters we find them to be sub - dominant . ] .",
    "we compute the fine tuning at two - loop order including the dominant third generation supersymmetric threshold effects to the scalar potential .",
    "the analysis is done in two stages .",
    "first a scan is performed over all of parameter space using a slightly simplified two - loop calculation developed to run quickly .",
    "then the analysis is redone using the ( slower ) ` softsusy  3.0.10 ` package  @xcite that includes all the effects mentioned above for a set of points that has low fine tuning .",
    "it was found important to work at two - loop order as @xmath6 changes significantly between one and two - loops .",
    "note that ` softsusy ` uses the measured values of the gauge couplings .",
    "the unification scale is determined by the point the @xmath21 and @xmath22 couplings unify ( of @xmath23  gev ) .",
    "full details of this procedure and an analysis of the results will appear in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure  1 . in this",
    "the higgs mass and @xmath6 are computed by ` softsusy ` .",
    "it agrees to within @xmath24gev with that determined by ` suspect `  @xcite but can differ by @xmath25gev  @xcite from that determined by ` feynhiggs `  @xcite .",
    "given this uncertainty , which comes from the higher order terms in the perturbative expansion , the lep  bound  @xcite should be interpreted as @xmath26gev . in what follows we will usually quote fine tuning computed for the central value .",
    "the relic density constraint is tested using ` micromegas 2.2 `  @xcite .",
    "the fine tuning distribution shows an interesting structure with a minimum close to the present lep  bound .",
    "this structure is largely generated by the @xmath27 dependence of @xmath17 in eq([min ] ) . at tree level",
    "the mssm value for @xmath27 is anomalously small , @xmath28 and this is the main reason why fine tuning is large at tree level .",
    "radiative corrections can increase @xmath27 , reducing the fine tuning .",
    "the structure shown in figure  1 is driven by this effect . for @xmath9 less than the lep  bound the fine tuning",
    "is dominated by the @xmath29 contribution and rises for _ decreasing _ @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the region corresponds to smaller @xmath30 where the radiatively corrected @xmath27 is smaller . since @xmath31 , we see from eq(5 ) that smaller @xmath32 leads to an increase in fine tuning ( for an extended discussion see @xcite ) . for @xmath9",
    "greater than the lep  bound the fine tuning is dominated by the @xmath33 contribution because in this region it is necessary to have large positive radiative corrections to the higgs mass and this requires large stop masses and in turn large @xmath33 , greater than the focus point  @xcite can control . since the higgs mass depends logarithmically on the stop masses , in this region",
    "@xmath34 is roughly proportional to @xmath35 the fine tuning measure in this region is in turn approximately proportional to @xmath34 and hence grows exponentially with the higgs mass .",
    "the two - loop corrections increases this growth slightly , explaining the sharp rise seen in figure  1 at large @xmath9 .",
    "the position of the dip in fine tuning comes from the lower bounds on the susymasses ; as they increase the dip moves to higher masses and @xmath36 at the minimum increases . if it rises beyond an unacceptable level one may conclude that the cmssm solution to the hierarchy problem has been fully tested and found to fail . at present",
    "we are far from this point with regions of susyparameter space having fine tuning less than 1 part in 8.8 .",
    "not yet included in the analysis is the constraint coming from the dark matter abundance . in figure  1(b ) we show that there are points in parameter space that populate the regions with small fine tuning and have a dark matter density consistent with providing all or some of the dark matter .",
    "note that this favours the part of the dip around the lep  higgs mass bound ( @xmath37@xcite,@xcite ) even though this bound has _ not _ been included in the analysis ! taking into account the theoretical uncertainty in determining @xmath9",
    "we conclude from that the most likely mass for the higgs consistent with the observed dark matter abundance is @xmath38 gev corresponding to a fine tuning of @xmath39 . for a saturation of the wmap bound within @xmath40",
    ", one finds @xmath41 gev corresponding to a fine tuning of 1:19 . for @xmath42 gev",
    "this rises to @xmath43 fine tuning and at @xmath44 gev to @xmath45 fine tuning .",
    "1.251.1    the fine tuning measure can readily be used to establish the remaining allowed range of the susy  parameters by plotting the contribution to fine tuning of the various components .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 . from these graphs",
    "one may see that , once one chooses an upper limit for the fine tuning measure @xmath46 the allowed range for the parameters is defined .",
    "for the case that we define @xmath47 as the upper limit beyond which we consider susy  has failed to solve the hierarchy problem , we obtain the bounds : @xmath48 $ \\mu $ & $ < ~680$~\\mbox{gev } &   & 120~\\mbox{gev}$~<$ & $ m_{1/2}$ & $ < ~720$~ \\mbox{gev } \\\\[3pt ] $ m_{0}$ & $ <",
    "~3.2$~\\mbox{tev } &   & $ -2$~\\mbox{tev}$~<$ & $ a_{0}$ & $ < ~2.5$~ \\mbox{tev } \\end{tabular}\\ ] ]    it is clear that there is still a wide range of parameters that needs to be explored when testing the cmssm .",
    "will the lhc be able to cover the whole range ? to answer this note that one must be able to exclude the upper limits of the mass parameters appearing in table 1 .",
    "of course the state that affects fine tuning most is the higgs scalar and one may see from figure  1 that establishing the bound @xmath49gev will imply that @xmath50 however the least fine tuned region corresponds to the lightest higgs consistent with the lep  bound and this is the region where the lhc searches rely on the @xmath51 channel which has a small cross section and will require some @xmath52 at @xmath53tev to explore . given this it is of interest to consider to what extent the direct susy  searches will probe the low fine tuned regions .",
    "for @xmath29 the @xmath47 upper bound corresponds to a higgsino mass of @xmath54tev ) while for @xmath55 the bound corresponds to a gluino mass of @xmath56tev ) and a wino or neutralino mass of @xmath57 gev ) . on the other hand , due to the focus point behaviour ,",
    "the bound on @xmath33 is very weak corresponding to squark and slepton masses in the multi tev region .",
    "thus we expect that in testing susy the most significant processes at the lhc will be those looking for gluinos , winos and neutralinos . in table",
    "1 we give the upper limits on the mass of these states corresponding to @xmath58 for comparison we show the limit on the stop and sbottom masses , much larger due to the weak limit on @xmath59 the remaining states of the mssm  spectrum are dominated by the @xmath60 soft mass term and are bounded by @xmath61(3  to  4.4  tev ) .",
    "all these upper mass limits scale approximately as @xmath62 , so may be adapted depending on how much fine tuning the reader is willing to accept .    .",
    "cmssm upper mass limits on superpartners ( in gev ) , such that @xmath63 remains possible . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results we have presented apply to the case of the cmssm .",
    "it is natural to ask how these results are modified when one considers additional effects beyond cmssm or relaxes some of its constraints .",
    "for example , one could consider different uv boundary conditions for scalar masses , non - universal gaugino masses or uv threshold corrections to the gauge couplings .",
    "let us discuss briefly how these can change our findings .",
    "universal scalar masses lead to a minimum of fine tuning through a focus point @xcite and the minimum fine tuning found here corresponds to this focus point .",
    "thus we expect fine tuning will increase if the universal scalar mass assumption is relaxed . for the case of non - universal gaugino masses , it is known that a reduction of the amount of fine tuning can be obtained @xcite below that of the cmssm case .",
    "however this condition is not always sufficient to reduce @xmath6 on its own , and depends on other parameters values such as @xmath64 or @xmath65 , which usually dominate the fine tuning @xcite .",
    "for a recent discussion of the reduction in fine tuning that can result from non - unversal gaugino masses see @xcite . regarding uv scale threshold corrections to gauge couplings ,",
    "if one imposes gauge coupling unification , they can affect the predictions for the low energy values of the couplings ( @xmath66 , ... ) @xcite and hence , _",
    "_ figure 1 , the fine tuning .",
    "however the bottom - up ` softsusy ` approach used here uses the measured values for the gauge couplings and hence does not need to know the uv scale threshold corrections .",
    "the fine tuning due to the running of the soft susy breaking parameters is only midly sensitive to the uv scale threshold corrections .    in summary",
    "we have made a detailed study of the possibility of testing the cmssm as a solution to the hierarchy problem using a fine tuning measure .",
    "this provides a way of quantifying and correlating the effects of the numerous experimental measurements sensitive to susy and for determining the region of parameter space that needs to be explored when testing the model .",
    "using this analysis new measurements providing stricter bounds on the cmssm spectrum will further limit the viable parameter space .",
    "similar analyses could ( and should ) be applied to more general susy  extensions of the sm and indeed to all proposed models claiming to solve the hierarchy problem .",

    "<S> this requirement is quantified by a fine tuning measure that provides a quantitative test of susy as a solution to the hierarchy problem . </S>",
    "<S> the measure is useful in correlating the impact of the various experimental measurements relevant to the search for supersymmetry and also in identifying the most sensitive measurements for testing susy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we apply the measure to the cmssm , computing it to two - loop order and taking account of current experimental limits and the constraint on dark matter abundance . using this </S>",
    "<S> we determine the present limits on the cmssm parameter space and identify the measurements at the lhc that are most significant in covering the remaining parameter space . without imposing the lep higgs mass bound we show that the smallest fine tuning ( 1:13 ) consistent with a relic density within the wmap bound corresponds to a higgs mass of 114@xmath02 gev . </S>",
    "<S> fine tuning rises rapidly for heavier higgs .    </S>",
