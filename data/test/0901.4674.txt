    "partly motivated by our increased capability in recent years to perform accurate observations on the sky , we have turned our attention to investigating the impact of quantum effects on the evolution of the universe . in pursuit of this goal , quantum field theory in cosmological spacetimes continues to be an increasingly important field of research . among other things",
    ", it investigates how quantum fluctuations affect the background spacetime in perturbative quantum gravity , a process also known as quantum backreaction .",
    "a line of research deals for example with the backreaction of quantum fields whose spectrum is nearly flat .",
    "examples of these fields are the minimally coupled massless scalar and the graviton .",
    "consequently , these fields are expected to yield a substantial backreaction @xcite . also , fermions in curved spacetimes and in particular maximally symmetric spacetimes were investigated ( see e.g. : @xcite ) .    another approach to this question",
    "is concerned with calculating the possible effect of the trace anomaly on the background spacetime .",
    "some authors argue that this effect , particularly in relation with the cosmological constant problem , could be significant @xcite , however also see @xcite .",
    "an essential element to study quantum effects in curved spaces is the propagator . due to its high degree of symmetry",
    ", de sitter spacetime proves to be ideally suited for calculating various quantum effects .",
    "moreover , results are immediately applicable to inflation , cosmologists favourite paradigm for a brief exponentially fast expansion in the early universe .",
    "chernikov and tagirov calculated the scalar propagator in de sitter spacetime @xcite , also see @xcite .",
    "the vector propagator was constructed by @xcite and the graviton propagator received contributions from @xcite . candelas and raine calculated the fermion propagator @xcite .",
    "however , de sitter spacetime suffers from several drawbacks .",
    "firstly , pure de sitter spacetime is never realised in nature .",
    "since de sitter spacetime corresponds to a globally constant hubble parameter @xmath4 , this is in reality never attained . secondly , de sitter spacetime is non - dynamical .",
    "it is therefore inconsistent to study backreaction effects while at the same time assuming a constant background .",
    "we should allow the background to change to encompass all possible backreaction effects consistently .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider propagators in more general spacetimes .",
    "the scalar and graviton propagator in quasi de sitter spacetime were calculated by @xcite and subsequently generalised to friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker or flrw spacetimes with constant deceleration by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the fermion propagator in flrw spacetimes with constant deceleration .",
    "we should touch upon an important issue . in the massive case",
    "we need two additional constraints to be satisfied in order to solve for the propagator :    [ assumptions ] @xmath5    recall that all interesting epochs in the evolution of our universe satisfy the first constraint . in the matter era",
    "we have @xmath6 , in the radiation dominated epoch we find @xmath7 .",
    "it also serves as an approximation to both inflation and the current dark energy dominated epoch when @xmath8 . note that @xmath9 coincides with the slow - roll parameter of inflation and it is straightforwardly related to the somewhat more familiar deceleration parameter @xmath10 .",
    "hence ( [ epsilon ] ) is equivalent to requiring a constant deceleration parameter .    the second assumption ( [ mhassumption ] ) is required to analytically derive the propagator in the massive case . in yukawa theory , the mass of the fermion is generated by a scalar field for which we can achieve @xmath11 in several cases to which we will turn shortly .",
    "we then calculate the one loop effective action induced by fermions using our propagator .",
    "the one loop backreaction arises from integrating out a free , quadratic fermion field and , using dimensional regularisation , this generates a correction to the ( classical ) friedmann equations .",
    "the hubble parameter occurring in this effective action is now a dynamical quantity .",
    "consequently , the backreaction of these fermions on the background spacetime can thus be analysed dynamically .",
    "also , when the fermions are coupled to a scalar field , this opens up the possibility to study the impact of the fermions on the evolution of scalar fields .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section",
    "[ fermions in flrw spacetimes ] we review the basic theory required to study fermions in curved spaces and we establish our notation . sections [ flrw fermion propagator : the massless case ] and [ flrw fermion propagator : the massive case ] are devoted to deriving the fermionic propagator in flrw spacetimes in the massless and massive case , respectively .",

    "this propagator is valid in any flrw spacetime and assumption ( [ epsilon ] ) can be relaxed . because massless fermions are conformal in any dimension , their propagator is much easier to calculate than the massless scalar propagator @xcite .",

    "we firstly solve for the fermionic mode functions .",
    "we generalise the approach outlined in @xcite to incorporate flrw spacetimes with constant @xmath9 . using these mode functions",

    "let us firstly define the rescaled fermionic spinor : @xmath81 keeping an eye on equation ( [ covariantderivative2 ] ) one can easily check that this factor is chosen such to conveniently transform the covariant derivative into a partial derivative .",
    "equation of motion ( [ fermioneom ] ) thus reads : @xmath82 the canonical momentum associated with @xmath83 follows from promoting the variation of ( [ fermionaction ] ) with respect to @xmath84 to an operator . according to the usual moves in quantum field theory",
    ", we impose anti - commutation relations between @xmath83 and its associated canonical momentum : @xmath85 with the other anti - commutators vanishing . by making use of the rescaling in equation ( [ fermionrescaled ] ) ,",
    "appreciate that the anti - commutation relations above simplify :    [ anticommutation2 ] @xmath86      therefore we expand the rescaled spinors @xmath87 and @xmath88 in creation and annihilation operators as follows :    [ creationannihilationexpansion ] @xmath89    the expansion above merits a few remarks .",
    "firstly , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the fermion and anti - fermion annihilation operators of helicity @xmath92 , respectively , in the usual sense : @xmath93 .",
    "the helicity @xmath92 , i.e. : the spin in the direction of motion , can be either @xmath94 or @xmath95 in units of @xmath96 .",

    "we will generalise the following considerations shortly to arbitrary dimensions .    in the equation above @xmath97",
    "is a 4-spinor of helicity @xmath92 .",
    "we decompose the 4-spinor @xmath98 into a direct product of chirality and helicity 2-spinors : @xmath99 here , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are left- and right - handed 1-spinors of helicity @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath102 is the helicity 2-eigenspinor : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a shorthand notation for the pauli matrices .",
    "furthermore note that @xmath105 .    for future convenience ,",
    "let us explicitly derive the two vectors @xmath102 .",
    "we write : @xmath106 and keep in mind that : @xmath107 it is a trivial exercise to solve for the two eigenvectors of @xmath108 , which correctly normalised to unity read :    [ helicity1 ] @xmath109    moreover , the helicity eigenstates are mutually orthogonal : @xmath110 finally , we have tacitly ignored the expansion of the anti - particle contribution @xmath111 in chirality and helicity spinors in equation ( [ creationannihilationexpansion ] ) .",
    "we will return to this subtlety shortly .",
    "our chirality and helicity decomposition of the spinor degrees of freedom in equation ( [ fermiondecompose ] ) also works in @xmath12 spacetime dimensions .",
    "once a particular representation of the gamma matrices has been found , the projection operator : @xmath112 splits the @xmath113-spinor degrees of freedom in two equal contributions of definite chirality , i.e. : a left- and right - handed @xmath114-spinor ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is fixed by requiring that @xmath117 is a proper projection operator : @xmath118 this yields : @xmath119 \\,.\\ ] ] in @xmath45 , we recognise the familiar @xmath120 .",
    "an helicity operator that commutes with the projection operator can be defined in fourier space as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the levi - civita tensor in @xmath123 dimensions .",
    "the exponential phase ensures that @xmath108 is hermitian .",
    "finally , the gamma function has been inserted to account for the number of different permutations of gamma matrices .",
    "hence , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are .",
    "note the definition of the helicity operator is consistent with ( [ helicity ] ) .",
    "most importantly , the chirality and helicity decomposition as proposed in equation ( [ fermiondecompose ] ) carries through for any dimension .    when an explicit form of @xmath102 is required , we return to @xmath45 and use equation ( [ helicity1 ] ) .",
    "we subsequently generalise the result of such calculations by analytically extending it to arbitrary @xmath12 .      in textbooks on quantum field theory , such as @xcite ,",
    "one expands the fermion in momentum space in spin eigenstates , whereas we expand in helicity eigenstates .",
    "this results in a different normalisation requirement on the spinors in momentum space and consequently the standard textbook results can not be straightforwardly copied .",
    "the reason for expanding in helicity eigenstates is that in curved spacetimes helicity is more convenient to work with rather than spin .",
    "spin is a conserved quantity , i.e. : an appropriate quantum number , in static backgrounds , whereas helicity is conserved in time dependent but spatially homogeneous backgrounds @xcite .",
    "one can easily show that the helicity operator constructed above in ( [ helicityd ] ) commutes with the kinetic operator in wigner space for spatially homogeneous correlators .",
    "we normalise the spinors using two conditions : a consistent canonical quantisation and orthogonality of particle and anti - particle spinors .",
    "we thus impose the usual anti - commutation relations between creation and annihilation operators :    [ anticommutation3 ] @xmath126    and all other anti - commutators vanish identically .",
    "now ( [ anticommutation3 ] ) is consistent with ( [ anticommutation2 ] ) if and only if : @xmath127 note that this is a condition on @xmath128 matrix elements in spinor space , i.e. : for each @xmath63 and @xmath64 the above equality has to be satisfied .    secondly , we require that the particle and anti - particle spinors are mutually orthogonal : @xmath129 this restricts 4 matrix elements in helicity space , i.e. : for each @xmath130 the above equality needs to be obeyed .    peskin and schroeder @xcite",
    "impose normalisation conditions on both particle and anti - particle spinors in spin space .",
    "the corresponding conditions in helicity space are only partially satisfied .",
    "both particle and anti - particle spinors of different helicity are trivially orthogonal by construction ( [ kvectorsorthogonal ] ) .",
    "however , we do not relate the amplitude of equal helicity states for particles and anti - particles to the mass of the spinor because helicity eigenstates for a particle at rest can not be constructed .",
    "we will now solve the dirac equation .",
    "let us insert equation ( [ creationannihilationexpansion ] ) into the dirac equation ( [ fermioneom2 ] ) .",
    "making use of our chirality and helicity decomposition ( [ fermiondecompose ] ) transforms the dirac equation to a first order coupled system of differential equations :    [ diraceq1 ] @xmath131    the arguments of the functions in the equation above have been omitted for notational convenience .",
    "the left- and right - handed spinors however are now a function of the magnitude of the fourier mode @xmath132 only , because the differential equation is invariant under @xmath133 .",
    "standard model fermions are chiral , in the sense that @xmath134 . for simplicity",
    ", we take one mass @xmath135 only .",
    "the following derivation can easily be generalised when standard model fermions are considered by making use of the @xmath117 projectors in equation ( [ p+- ] ) .",
    "we now return to the expansion in chirality and helicity spinors of the anti - particle contribution @xmath111 , which we did not need so far .",
    "since the dirac equation is a linear differential equation , the solution for @xmath111 can not contain any new degrees of freedom once we completely solved for @xmath98 .",
    "in other words : the form of @xmath111 is dictated once we have completely specified @xmath98 .",
    "we expand @xmath111 slightly differently : @xmath136 note we flipped the position of the left- and right - handed spinors compared to ( [ fermiondecompose ] ) .",
    "consequently , the resulting equations of motion for both @xmath137 and @xmath138 are identical to ( [ diraceq1 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we could have expanded differently and flipped helicity , i.e. : send @xmath139 in equation ( [ fermiondecompose ] ) . because the mass enforces mixing between different chirality states , labelling these states differently has no physical relevance .",
    "we return to equation of motion ( [ diraceq1 ] ) and define : @xmath140 this transforms equation ( [ diraceq1 ] ) to :    [ diraceq2 ] @xmath141    we exploit assumption ( [ epsilon ] ) , which is equivalent to ( [ epsilonconstant ] ) . inserting this expression into the equation above yields :    [ diraceq3 ] @xmath142    recall that the mass of a fermion in yukawa theory is time dependent in flrw spacetimes",
    ". there does not exist a rescaling of the functions @xmath143 that removes the mass dependence in the equation of motion above .",
    "even when one assumes that the mass @xmath144 is time independent , one can not find such a rescaling .",
    "it is particularly simple to choose @xmath145 constant as following from equation ( [ phiproptoh ] ) and for convenience we define : @xmath146 we can proceed and decouple the two linear differential equations to find : @xmath147 the solutions are given by : @xmath148 where @xmath149 are two normalisation constants that still need to be determined and @xmath150 is the hankel function of the first kind of order : @xmath151 this implies :    @xmath152    the hankel function of the second kind also solves equation ( [ diraceq4 ] ) . in the infinite asymptotic past ,",
    "equivalent to the deep uv , the fermions become effectively massless for @xmath153 and the distinction between @xmath154 and @xmath155 vanishes as a consequence .",
    "therefore we require that the vacuum mode functions in this regime equal the standard conformal vacuum solutions :    [ uvlimit ] @xmath156    this excludes the hankel function of the second kind for the moment from contributing . away from the vacuum",
    ", we should of course also incorporate the second solution to ( [ diraceq4 ] ) to allow for mode mixing .",
    "note that the uv limits above yield the familiar uv behaviour for the left- and right - handed spinors ( e.g. : @xcite ) :    [ uvlimit2 ] @xmath157    when solutions ( [ diraceq5sols ] ) are substituted in ( [ diraceq3a ] ) one finds : @xmath158 we are free to fix the remaining coefficient @xmath159 by the following condition : @xmath160 we postpone the motivation for this requirement to section [ normalisation of the mode functions ] . for the moment ,",
    "let us simply normalise accordingly for convenience .",
    "we thus find : @xmath161 where we have chosen the unobservable phase factor in accordance with the uv limit ( [ uvlimit ] ) .",
    "we use some well - known identities involving hankel functions which we list for convenience in appendix [ properties of hankel functions ] .",
    "concluding , we find that the vacuum solutions to equation ( [ diraceq3 ] ) neglecting derivatives of @xmath9 and treating the quotient @xmath145 as time independent are given by :    [ diraceq6sols ] @xmath162    as we send @xmath163 and approach de sitter space , our solution is in accordance with @xcite , as can be seen from ( [ order ] ) . in this solution we have tacitly assumed that @xmath164 such that @xmath165 , equivalent to an accelerated expansion .",
    "if however @xmath166 or @xmath167 , which corresponds to a decelerating universe , one should simply use relations ( [ hankelprops8][hankelprops9 ] ) in appendix [ properties of hankel functions ] .",
    "the case @xmath168 requires special attention , see e.g. @xcite for the analogous scalar propagator case .",
    "let us now turn our attention to finding the solution for the second mode function corresponding to the excited state .",
    "the procedure is completely analogous : we again let @xmath169 and match to the appropriate uv expansion involving the second solution @xmath170 .",
    "we normalise the solution according to ( [ normalisation2 ] ) and choose the phase factor in accordance with the corresponding uv limit",
    ". we can thus construct the total solution by linear superposition :    [ diraceqtotalsol1 ] @xmath171    where :    [ diraceqtotalsol2 ] @xmath172    note that we have omitted all @xmath132 dependence in ( [ diraceqtotalsol1 ] ) for notational convenience .",
    "note finally that the two fundamental solutions ( [ diraceqtotalsol2 ] ) in @xmath173 are not complex conjugates of each other , unlike for example for the scalar field case .",
    "however , the second solution @xmath174 can be obtained from complex conjugation of the fundamental solutions comprising @xmath175 , as can clearly be seen in equation ( [ diraceqtotalsol1 ] ) above .    for the moment",
    ", we leave the normalisation constants @xmath176 and @xmath177 undetermined .",
    "appreciate we are nevertheless free to normalise the fundamental solutions to unity .",
    "of course we will determine the normalisation constants shortly by applying our analysis performed in subsection [ spinorial normalisation conditions ] . but",
    "first , we need to solve for the anti - particle mode functions .",
    "let us stress again that the other spinor @xmath178 can not contain any new degrees of freedom because dirac s equation is linear .",
    "we only have to determine the connection with @xmath97 . when we expand according to ( [ fermiondecompose2 ] ) the coupled linear differential equations @xmath137 and @xmath138 obey are identical to ( [ diraceq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can analogously define : @xmath179 we are rewarded for our extensive discussion of chirality and helicity .",
    "the solutions of @xmath180 are identical to ( [ diraceqtotalsol1 ] ) , where we should only denote the coefficients in this solution differently :    [ diraceqtotalsol5 ] @xmath181    the functions appearing in this equation are given by ( [ diraceqtotalsol2 ] ) . we need to determine how the coefficients @xmath176 and @xmath177 of @xmath182 relate to @xmath183 and @xmath184 of @xmath180 .",
    "moreover , we need to find the correct normalisation condition for @xmath176 and @xmath177 .      inspired by our discussion in [ spinorial normalisation conditions ] , we impose two normalisation conditions on the spinors : a consistent canonical quantisation ( [ consistentquantisation ] ) and orthogonality between particle and anti - particle spinors ( [ orthogonality ] ) .    after quite some work the , naively , 10 constraint equations in @xmath45 in ( [ consistentquantisation ] ) yield the following 3 conditions on our coefficients :    [ consistentquantisation2 ] @xmath185 the orthogonality condition ( [ orthogonality ] ) yields one more condition : @xmath186    the solution is :    [ consistentquantisation3 ] @xmath187 the last line relates the phases of our normalisation constants , e.g. : @xmath188 denotes the phase of @xmath183 . moreover , from ( [ consistentquantisation2 ] ) we can derive : @xmath189 ) results in a change of the right - hand side of equations ( [ consistentquantisation2a ] ) , ( [ consistentquantisation3d ] ) and ( [ consistentquantisation3e ] ) . normalising the fundamental solutions to unity as in ( [ normalisation2 ] )",
    "is particularly convenient as it allows for a particle interpretation of @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the normalisation constants provide us with three physical degrees of freedom .",
    "of course @xmath192 is physical which determines @xmath193 through ( [ consistentquantisation3d ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath194 is physical just as in the scalar field case . since @xmath195 is a phase that can be removed without physical consequences , the phase relation ( [ consistentquantisation3c ] ) determines @xmath188 in terms of the third physical phase @xmath196 .",
    "note finally that one of the two phase relations ( [ consistentquantisation2c ] ) and ( [ consistentquantisation2d ] ) is redundant in this part of the analysis .",

    "the same statement holds for divergences in the stress energy tensor in for example the trace anomaly literature ( see e.g. : @xcite ) . at this point",
    ", one can interpret the results differently :    1 .",
    "the hubble parameter can quite conservatively be treated as a _",
    "constant_. the argument for this case is simple : throughout the calculation one simply assumed a constant hubble parameter .",
    "the hubble parameter is promoted to a _",
    "dynamical _ quantity : @xmath317 a reason for supporting this case would be the following : when @xmath8 one would find the de sitter result as a leading order contribution in each time interval where the hubble parameter varies only adiabatically slowly , a spacetime also known as locally de sitter spacetime .",
    "depending on which of the two interpretations one adheres to , one would renormalise differently . if one advocates the first point of view , all terms of e.g. an effective action merely contribute to the renormalised cosmological constant . if , however , one prefers the second interpretation , one adds ( dynamical ) curvature invariants in order to cancel these divergences in a covariant manner .",
    "we observe the following . in the effective action ( [ effectiveactionrenormalised ] ) above , the hubble parameter is a dynamical quantity . hence , covariant counterterms added to cancel uv divergences can and should be treated dynamically .",

    "albeit strictly speaking not allowed to relax the assumption @xmath318 in de sitter spacetime , we conclude that promoting the hubble parameter to a dynamical quantity @xmath319 has been a useful approach .",

    "hence , the mode functions at some later time @xmath56 can be obtained from the initial condition at @xmath323 by means of a transfer matrix . ] .",
    "one could simply allow @xmath9 and @xmath145 to vary in time and choose ( if necessary infinitesimally small ) time intervals in which @xmath9 and @xmath145 vary only slowly .",
    "subsequently , one can match the solutions in two neighbouring intervals and study mode mixing in the spirit of @xcite . in this case",
    ", this procedure would imply that we would have to renormalise for each time interval separately , for the coefficients in equation ( [ countertermscoefficientsalt ] ) depend on @xmath9 .",
    "this is not surprising : a sudden jump , even infinitesimally small , in for example @xmath145 is not a physical phenomenon and would call for non - local counterterms ( see e.g. : @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed the fermionic propagator in realistic flrw spacetimes with constant deceleration parameter @xmath0 . moreover",
    ", we assumed that @xmath145 is also constant , which can be realised in yukawa theory by means of a scalar field for which @xmath11 .",
    "we have derived the propagator both in the ( trivial ) massless case ( [ fermionpropmassless2 ] ) and in the massive case ( [ fermionpropagator ] ) .",
    "two pillars support our derivation .",
    "we split the fermionic degrees of freedom into a direct product of chirality and helicity eigenspinors .",
    "we normalise the spinors using a consistent canonical quantisation and we require orthogonality of particle and anti - particle spinors .",
    "moreover , we verify that upon sending @xmath9 to zero , we recover the known vacuum - to - vacuum de sitter results in the literature .",
    "we calculate the one loop effective action induced by fermions using our propagator .",
    "the one loop backreaction arises from integrating out a free , quadratic fermion field and , using dimensional regularisation , this generates a correction to the ( classical ) friedmann equations .",
    "this effective action allows for the first time for a dynamical interpretation of @xmath4 such that the study of dynamical backreaction either on the background spacetime or on scalar fields coupled to these fermions is within reach .",

    "the authors thank gerard t hooft , gleb arutyunov and tomas janssen and acknowledge financial support from fom grant 07pr2522 and by utrecht university .",
    "in section [ particle mode functions ] we used the following well - known identities involving hankel functions :    [ hankelprops ] @xmath324 the wronskian of two hankel functions reads : @xmath325 & = & -\\frac{4 i}{\\pi z }   \\label{hankelprops5}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , we made use of the following recurrence relation : @xmath326",
    "consider the following integral equation : @xmath327 here , @xmath328 is a bessel function of the first kind and @xmath208 is a macdonald function .",
    "note that for all integrals in ( [ fourierintegral ] ) both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are purely imaginary .",
    "the requirements from @xcite are such that :          we choose @xmath331 to make the integral convergent .",
    "we now use equation ( 6.578.10 ) from @xcite to find : @xmath332 where : @xmath333 here , @xmath334 represents the associated legendre function which we can rewrite in terms of a gauss hypergeometric function @xmath335 by means of equations ( 8.702 ) and ( 9.131.1 ) of @xcite : @xmath336 upon taking @xmath337 we find : @xmath338 \\,.\\ ] ] finally note that we can further simplify the argument of the hypergeometric function in equation ( [ i6 ] ) to : @xmath339 let us finally stress that we have introduced @xmath331 to make the integral convergent .",
    "it is however of significant physical importance for it is the same @xmath340 that dictates the @xmath232 pole prescription in the propagator ( see equations ( [ fermionpropagator][fermionpropagator2 ] ) and ( [ y ] ) ) .",
