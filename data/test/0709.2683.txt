    "at the ilc it will be necessary to measure the beam polarisation with a precision of 0.25% to fully exploit the physics potential of machine and detectors  @xcite .",
    "these measurements will be realised via compton polarimeters , where cherenkov counters detect the backscattered compton electrons .",
    "the compton cross sections for different configurations of the laser light    l0.70    ( 10.4 , 8.47 ) ( 0.0 , 3.8 ) ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) ( 9.3 , 8.3 ) ( a ) ( 9.3 , 3.4 ) ( b )    and @xmath0 spin helicities are different , allowing for an asymmetry measurement , from which the polarisation level of the @xmath0-beams can finally be determined . for the upstream polarimeter a special magnetic chicane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magnchic - cherhodolayout](a ) ) is envisioned , so that the compton edge of the backscattered electron beam will always be at the same position in the cherenkov detector regardless of the energy of the original electron / positron beam .",
    "circularly polarised laser light is scattered off the @xmath0-beams with about @xmath1 interactions per bunch .",
    "the scattered @xmath0 are then deflected by the dipole magnetic fields of the chicane and led to the detector , whose current baseline design  @xcite consists of gas tubes read out by photomultipliers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magnchic - cherhodolayout](b ) ) .",
    "the incident @xmath0 generate cherenkov radiation inside the gas tubes , which is then detected by photomultipliers .",
    "however , alternative design possibilities , using quartz fibers and silicon photomultipliers , are also being studied .    for the detector r&d ,",
    "many different aspects have to be taken into account and optimised . among these are not only the choice of gas or the inside mirror - coating of the cherenkov gas tubes ( currently similar to those used for the polarimeter of the sld detector at slac ) , but also different aspects of the photomultiplier and read - out electronics .",
    "it will , for example , be necessary to optimise the quantum efficiency , the sensitive area and the dynamic range of the photomultipliers , but also the reflectivity and the light extraction from the gas tubes .",
    "furthermore , since the goal of achieving a polarisation measurement with a precision of 0.25% is very ambitious , the linearity of all detector components is extremely important .",
    "all non - linear effects ( photodetectors , electronics , etc . ) need to be measured precisely and corrected for if necessary .",
    "this test stand is based on camac electronics and is used to develop different techniques for on- and off - line linearity measurements of various electronics components and different photodetectors . up to now , two different methods for measuring the linearity of a qdc have been studied . the first method , of which fig .",
    "[ fig : electronicstest ] illustrates the setup , uses a sine wave as input to the qdc .",
    "the transition codes , or rather , the probability @xmath2 for    l0.48    ( 6.0 , 1.84 ) ( 0.0 , 0.0 )    each transition to occur at a certain adc - code is measured and compared to the response of an ideal qdc , see fig .  [",
    "fig : measurements](a ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4  pc is the charge amplitude at full scale range .",
    "figure  [ fig : measurements](b ) shows the differential non - linearity ( dnl ) , i.e. , the difference between the measured and ideal qdc codes ,    ( 14.0 , 4.4 ) ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) ( 4.8 , 0.0 ) ( 9.5 , 0.0 ) ( 0.0,-0.1 ) ( a ) ( 4.8,-0.1 ) ( b ) ( 9.5,-0.1 ) ( c )    while fig .",
    "[ fig : measurements](c ) displays the corresponding integral non - linearity ( inl ) after gain and offset correction , exemplary for channel 1 .",
    "if a straight - line - fit is applied in the mid range of codes , from 200 to 800 adc - counts , the inl ranges from 1 to 2 lsbs ( least significant bit , or ideal qdc code width ) , corresponding to 0.1 - 0.2% of the full scale range .",
    "the second method is a qdc self - test , integrated in the readout software .",
    "a dc - voltage from 0 to 20  v is applied to the qdc ( 1  v @xmath5 12.5  pc ) and the measured charge is compared to the input charge for multiple charge injections .",
    "this second method is less precise and , moreover , requires many steps and thus a very long measurement time .    in the near future",
    ", the component test stand will be used for a variety of other measurements , including the characterisation of different photo detectors ( conventional pmts and rather new developments , e.g. silicon photomultipliers ) , further linearity measurements regarding the photo detectors and , possibly , the entire readout chain .",
    "longer term plans for this test stand also foresee measurements of temperature effects , the gain stability and other issues .",
    "as of early may 2006 , the sld cherenkov detector is located at desy .",
    "however , the necessary hardware components for its setup are not yet available , but a vme - pci interface as well as charge - sensitive adc ( qdc ) have been ordered .",
    "( for a description of the entire sld - detector and the compton polarimeter see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) for the detector commissioning it is planned to first test all nine channels for functionality  with a system of blue ( and green ) leds .",
    "furthermore , the reflectivity and light yield ( @xmath6 geometry ) , the sensitivity of the photo detectors , and the light extraction from the gas tubes will be studied .",
    "later on , temperature effects will also be investigated , which might lead to an active regulation / stabilisation via thermo - electric elements . a proposal from april 18 , 2007 lists further planned measurements , that will serve as a reference for studying new design features . each measurement",
    "will either be performed as component and readout test of a single channel or of the entire detector system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sld - det ] ) , including :    * the characterisation of different types of photomultipliers ( regarding sensitivity ) * * dark rate / light response ; * * voltage and/or temperature dependence ; * * dynamic range / sensitivity ; * the pros / cons of different types of photo detectors and connecting fibers : * * photo detectors : conventional pms , apds , and sipms ; * * fiber types : optical , wavelength - shifting fibers ; * and the analysis of different couplings : ( direct , air gap , etc . ) between gas tubes & fibers , and between fibers & photo detectors ; * linearity / non - linearity measurements for different configurations    ( 15.0 , 10.0 ) ( 0.2 , 0.0 ) ( -0.1 , 4.4 ) ( 8.2 , 2.3 )",
