    "the flow around a flapping foil has been studied in a variety of conditions .",

    "the wake of foils with an imposed flapping and translational motion , and its relation with the reacting forces on them has deserved attention due to its relation to flying and swimming  @xcite .",
    "little has been done in the case of an imposed flapping on a foil free to swim , although work can be found related to other type of swimmers at moderate reynolds numbers  @xcite . here",
    "we study numerically a two - dimensional foil with an imposed flapping motion , immersed in a stream , that can be released and become free of translational motion .",
    "both phenomena were studied and compared for moderate reynolds numbers , where inertia and viscous forces are important .",
    "we used the lattice boltzmann model ( lbm ) of  @xcite , with a procedure to include immersed moving boundaries of arbitrary shape subject to hydrodynamic forces  @xcite .",
    "the lbm is an efficient algorithm to approximate solutions to the navier- stokes equations when implemented on massively parallel architectures , where it can handle simulations of high resolution and large computational domains  @xcite . for the problem in hand",
    "the lbm seemed a good option , since wakes behind objects may show interesting behaviour far away behind the object  @xcite , and so a large domain relative to the size of the foil was desirable , along with enough resolution to observe vortex formation and evolution .",
    "the article is divided as follows , in section [ sec : stat ] the general problem is presented and the numerical method used is described briefly in section [ sec : lbe ] . in section [ sec : val ] the results are presented and discussed .",
    "conclusions are summarised in in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "consider an unbounded two dimensional and incompressible flow of a viscous fluid around a rigid flapping foil made by a semicircle , with diameter @xmath0 , intersected with an isosceles triangle of high @xmath1 , as shown in figure [ fig : prob ] .",
    "schematic illustration of the flow around a flapping foil.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    two cases are considered , a foil with a point fixed in space and a foil free to move . in both cases",
    "the flapping motion consist of an oscillation with respect to the centre of the semicircle , which is fixed in space in one case and free in the other . to simplify the calculations",
    ", it is assumed that the foil mass density distribution , @xmath2 , is such that its centre of mass is at the centre of the semicircle .",
    "the governing equations for the fluid , with mass density @xmath3 and kinematic viscosity @xmath4 , are the navier - stokes equations given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the velocity and pressure fields , respectively .",
    "consider no - slip condition at the foil s surface .",
    "constant pressure and a uniform and horizontal velocity field @xmath8 are imposed far from the foil ( see figure [ fig : prob ] ) .",
    "the rigid foil is forced to rotate around the centre of the semicircle ( also its centre of mass ) so that the angle of its axis of symmetry with respect to the horizontal coordinate evolve with @xmath9 ( see figure [ fig : prob ] ) .",
    "the velocity of a point at the foil s surface is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the position of the centre of mass , @xmath12 its velocity and @xmath13 is the position of a point at the foil s surface .",
    "therefore , the no - slip boundary condition takes the form @xmath14 . in the case of the free flapping foil ,",
    "the motion of its centre of mass is obtained by solving @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the foil .",
    "the hydrodynamical force @xmath17 acting on the foil , is obtained directly from the computed flow fields .    to work with non - dimensional variables we choose @xmath0 as the characteristic length , @xmath18 as the characteristic velocity and the fluid density @xmath3 . with this choice of scaling the flow regime",
    "is determined by five dimensionless parameters : the reynolds number @xmath19 , the strouhal number @xmath20 the dimensionless amplitude @xmath21 , the ratio between the chord of the foil and the circle s diameter @xmath22 , and the fluid - foil s mass density ratio @xmath23 which is set to unity to work with a non - buoyant foil . the hydrodynamic force is scaled with @xmath24 .",
    "we define the drag @xmath25 and lift @xmath26 coefficients as the horizontal and vertical components of @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "notice that negative values of @xmath25 correspond to a thrust dominated hydrodynamic force .",
    "solutions to equations ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ cont ] ) for the pressure and velocity fields are approximated using a lattice - boltzmann model .",
    "the numerical procedures are described in the following section .",
    "to compute the flow around the flapping foil a two dimensional , nine neighbours ( d2q9 ) lattice - boltzmann model was used @xcite .",
    "the proposed algorithm , that includes moving immersed boundaries , was validated in a previous work concerning a problem of a moving cylinder in a convective flow  @xcite .    in this method space",
    "is discretised using a square lattice .",
    "lattice spacing as well as time steps can be conveniently set to unity .",

    "it is well known that the above procedure approximates solutions to the navier - stokes equations in the limit of small mach numbers @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lbed ] ) provide an explicit algorithm for updating all the distribution functions @xmath44 at a given node in the lattice , as long as its 8 nearest neighbouring nodes are inside the fluid domain . for nodes adjacent to a solid wall , the distribution functions coming from neighbouring nodes outside the fluid domain must be provided as a boundary condition for the method .",
    "we choose to adopt the set of boundary conditions proposed by @xcite for curved rigid walls .",
    "the force and torque acting on the body are computed using the momentum - exchange method of @xcite . for the free flapping foil , as rotational motion is imposed , only the force is used to compute the foils translational motion using a forward euler integration in time at each time step .",
    "this is a particular case of the scheme described in @xcite for the motion of a free particle in a convective flow using the lattice - boltzmann model .",
    "the computational domain was a rectangular lattice of @xmath45 nodes for the fixed foil , and of @xmath46 nodes for the free foil .",
    "the foil had a length @xmath1 of 280 to 600 nodes , a width @xmath0 of 80 nodes ( about a @xmath47 of the width and length of the domain ) , and was placed at 3000 nodes from the left boundary of the domain ( @xmath48 foil lengths ) . to simulate conditions",
    "far from the foil , the velocity was set to @xmath8 at the left boundary following the procedure of @xcite . on the rest of the boundaries , the normal components of the velocity gradients",
    "were set to zero setting the unknown velocity at the boundary equal to that of the adjacent node normal to the wall .",
