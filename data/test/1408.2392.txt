    "since its realization as a truly two - dimensional ( 2d ) material , graphene has attracted much interest , both due to fundamental science and technological importance in various fields @xcite .",
    "however , the realization of a tunable band gap , suitable for device fabrications , is still challenging and spin - orbit - coupling ( soc ) is very weak in graphene . to overcome these limitations researchers have been increasingly studying similar materials .",
    "one such material , called silicene , is a monolayer honeycomb structure of silicon and has been predicted to be stable @xcite .",
    "already several attempts have been made to synthesize it @xcite and its properties are reviewed in ref . .",
    "despite controversy over whether silicene has been created or not @xcite , it is expected to be an excellent candidate material because it has a strong soc and an electrically tunable band gap @xcite .",
    "it s a single layer of silicon atoms with a honeycomb lattice structure and compatible with silicon - based electronics that dominates the semiconductor industry .",
    "silicene has dirac cones similar to those of graphene and density functional calculations showed that the soc induced gap in it is about 1.55 mev @xcite . moreover , very recent theoretical studies predict the stability of silicene on non metallic surfaces such as graphene @xcite , boron nitride or sic @xcite , and in graphene - silicene - graphene structures @xcite .",
    "besides the strong soc , another salient feature of silicene is its buckled lattice structure with the a and b sublattice planes separated by a vertical distance @xmath2 so that inversion symmetry can be broken by an external perpendicular electric field resulting in a staggered potential @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the energy gap in it can be controlled electrically .",
    "due to this unusual band structure , silicene is expected to show exotic properties such as quantum spin / valley and anomalous hall effects @xcite , magneto - optical and electrical transport @xcite , etc ..    one interesting property of 2d materials is their use in developing fast plasmonic devices @xcite .",
    "plasmons are quantized collective oscillations of the electron liquid . in graphene",
    "they have been studied extensively both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "so far though in silicene the relevant studies are limited @xcite and do not take into account the effect of an exchange field @xmath1 which can be induced by ferromagnetic adatoms@xcite or a ferromagentic substrate@xcite .",
    "this is important as this field leads to spin- and valley - polarized currents@xcite and , as will be shown , brings a spin and valley texture to the particle - hole excitation spectrum ( phes ) .",
    "the application of a perpendicular electric field @xmath0 enhances the soc gap for one spin and valley type , while it shrinks it for the other @xcite . together with the influence of the field m , which breaks the spin degeneracy , this leads to valley polarization and the occurrence of the anomalous hall effect @xcite . in this work",
    "we combine these two peculiar features and calculate the dynamical polarization function within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and silicene s plasmonic response to optical excitations .",

    "this branch indicates a spin - down plasmon but one which can decay very quickly into spin - up electron - hole pairs leading to a strong absorption in this region as shown in fig . [",
    "fig:2dplot](d ) .",
    "this plasmon lies outside the phes and is therefore neither spin- nor valley - polarized .",
    "however , the plasmon - like branch inside the spin - up phes does resemble a spin - polarized system but with a very short lifetime .",
    "we investigated how electric ( @xmath0 ) and exchange ( @xmath1 ) fields can be used to tune the plasmonic response of the electron gas in silicene .",
    "these fields affect the phes of electrons with opposite spin and valley indices in different ways giving the phes a spin and valley texture and thus leading to spin- and valley - polarized plasmons .",
    "their lifetime is , however , finite because they can easily decay into electron - hole pairs with different spin or valley indices .",
    "further , the field @xmath1 affects strongly the oscillator strength .",
    "the undamped plasmon that remains has a negligible strength and is therefore not expected to show up in experiments . if the fermi level lies in the gap of a spin in one valley , the intraband region of the corresponding phes disappears . for zero @xmath0 and finite @xmath1",
    "the spin symmetry is broken and spin polarization is possible .",
    "we found a low - momentum plasmon dispersion that has the typical 2d @xmath163 behaviour . at higher momentum ,",
    "the plasmon dispersion differs from this @xmath163 dependence .",
    "however , a strong field @xmath1 can induce plasmons with finite lifetime of one spin type for which the dispersion follows closely the approximate plasmon branch .",
    "the results reported in this work pertain to free - standing silicene since we used the permittivity @xmath173 of the vacuum .",
    "for silicene on a substrate the permittivity will be different and the results will be modified quantitatively .",
    "the plasmon branches will be curved downward and the phes can be avoided yielding plasmons with larger oscillator strength .",
    "we evaluated the plasmon dispersion within the framework of the rpa which is valid for high electron densities . for lower densities",
    "further work is necessary to obtain more accurate results for silicene s plasmonic properties .    the predicted spin - and valley - polarization of plasmons is a consequence of a mechanism similar to that responsible for directional filtering of plasmons in a 2d electron gas.@xcite in this case the anisotropy of the electron dispersion renders the phes anisotropic and damps the plasmons in one direction more than in the other .",
    "recently a lot of experimental progress has been made in the detection of plasmons in 2d materials.@xcite to overcome the mismatch of energy and momentum with light in free space , one uses a periodic diffractive grid , cuts the sheet into ribbons or other shapes , and uses an afm tip to excite the electron liquid or uses a resonant metal antenna@xcite .",
    "the appropriate experimental probe though will strongly depend on the setup used to stabilize the silicene crystal .",
    "we believe that at the current pace of experimental progress , in the creation of silicene and the probing of plasmons in 2d materials , the results presented in this paper will soon be tested experimentally .",
    "this work was supported by the european science foundation ( esf ) under the eurocores program euro - graphene within the project congran , the flemish science foundation ( fwo - vl ) by an aspirant grant to bvd , the methusalem foundation of the flemish government , and by the canadian nserc grant no . ogp0121756 .",
    "the results for the polarization shown in eqs . @xmath174 and @xmath175 each depend on a dimensionless function that determines the variation of the polarization in the @xmath137 plane . for the vacuum polarization",
    "this function is given in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 defined earlier . in the following , we will suppress the prime notation for simplicity and set @xmath179 .",
