    "in order to capture some qualitative features of @xmath4 dimensional gravity , it is always useful to consider simpler toy models that are free of many of the technical difficulties of the full theory . this is particularly true of @xmath0 gravity . before 1984 , roughly speaking , the theory was considered to be `` too trivial '' to deserve any attention .",
    "it was with the work of deser , jackiw and thooft @xcite,@xcite , who considered point particle solutions , and later with the papers by achucarro and townsend @xcite and witten @xcite , that an avalanche of papers on @xmath0 gravity followed .",
    "a very wide spectrum of issues have been addressed in this years , from the `` problem of time '' to the `` loop representation '' , and more recently , black hole solutions @xcite . for recent reviews see @xcite and particularly @xcite . for a review of the @xmath0 black hole see @xcite .",
    "@xmath5dimensional gravity has been successful in providing simplified models in the study of black hole physics . in particular , the case when a negative cosmological constant is added ( anti  de sitter space - times ) has been extensively studied in the last years . on the one hand it has been shown @xcite that making certain identifications in anti ",
    "de sitter ( ads ) geometry , one obtains a black hole solution ( btz black hole ) . on the other hand , in string theories it has been found that there is a whole family of supersymmetric black brane solutions whose `` near horizon '' geometry is the product of spheres and the three dimensional ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "the study of the quantum properties of the btz black hole has been studied using many approaches , all of them giving a quantum mechanical derivation of the black hole entropy @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the case of a positive cosmological constant has also received recent attention .",
    "maldacena and strominger @xcite have given a cft derivation of the entropy associated to the cosmological horizon , following earlier results by carlip @xcite .",
    "more recently , similar derivations in the euclidean continuation have given an alternative explanation of the hawking - gibbons entropy of de sitter space - time @xcite .",
    "in this note we consider three dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to explore a little - known duality that exists between lorentzian @xmath0 gravity with a _ positive _ cosmological constant and euclidean gravity with a _ negative _ constant @xcite .",
    "as first shown in @xcite , @xmath0 gravity can be formulated as a theory of connections .",
    "there are two ways of writing the 3-dimensional action that involve connections .",
    "the einstein - hilbert - palatini action has as independent fields a `` spin '' connection @xmath6 and a ( non - degenerate ) co - triad field @xmath7 .",
    "the `` pure - connection '' formulation considers a chern - simons action where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are combined into a single connection @xmath8 living in a larger gauge group .",
    "this later description simplifies the structure of the theory and it is possible to completely characterize the state space .",
    "when one works in the so called `` frozen formalism '' , i.e. , in the reduced phase space of the theory , one is dealing with the `` true degrees of freedom '' of the theory .",
    "that is , roughly speaking , an equivalence class of classical solutions where one does not distinguish between configurations that are related by a `` gauge transformation '' .",
    "however , in the cases of interest for this note ( @xmath9 signature with @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) , both the space of histories and the reduced phase spaces have been shown to _",
    "coincide _ @xcite .",
    "thus , we have a mathematical identical description of the two systems .",
    "this is quite surprising and disturbing at first .",
    "but , as it is the case in many physical situations , the `` physics '' is in the interpretation of the formalism .",
    "as we shall see , there is a precise way to reconstruct two space - times , each one with a different signature , for each point of the ( reduced ) phase space .",
    "this construct also provides an explicit mapping between this space - times , or using a `` wheelerism '' , a _ wick rotation without wick rotation_.    let us illustrate this duality using some heuristic arguments . take the euclidean btz solution with positive mass @xmath13 and no angular momentum . in three spacetime dimensions",
    "this means that mass is dimensionless and @xmath14 has units of length .",
    "] ,    @xmath15    and make the following identifications : @xmath16 we obtain , @xmath17    here we have changed the names of the variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this solution looks like a cosmological `` big ",
    "bang '' solution , with a singularity at @xmath20 . in the next sections",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case , and that this space - time is in a precise sense , dual to the btz solution",
    ".    now take ( [ btz ] ) with @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "these are `` particle '' solutions , with no horizon and naked , conical singularities at @xmath22 .",
    "the angle deficit of this cones is @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 we get the singular free global ads spacetime . proceeding with ( [ analitic ] ) in this solution",
    "we get    @xmath25    this represents a spacetime with a cosmological horizon at @xmath26 and a conical singularity at @xmath22 with deficit angle @xmath27 . near the horizon , defining @xmath28 , we find , @xmath29 note that in order that the euclidean continuation of this solution is singularity free in the @xmath30 plane , we must identify the time @xmath31 with period @xmath32 .",
    "this period can be associated to the inverse temperature of the solution , which in this case is @xcite , @xmath33    it is worth noting that we could formally associate a temperature to the dual of the particle case , which had no horizon and thus no natural notion of temperature .",
    "reciprocally , the originally hot btz black hole is continued to a cosmological solution with no natural temperature , for which one could again assign some formal temperature .",

    "the einstein - hilbert action for 3-dimensional gravity , @xmath35:=\\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\int_m \\d^3\\!x\\,\\sqrt{|g|}(r-2\\lambda)\\ , , \\ ] ] can be rewritten in terms of a @xmath36form connection @xmath6 and a @xmath36-form triad field @xmath7 as follows @xcite , @xmath37:= \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\int_m \\epsilon_{ijk } \\left(f(\\omega)^{ij}\\wedge e^k -\\frac{\\lambda}{3 } e^i\\wedge e^j   \\wedge e^k   \\right)\\ , , \\label{actionx}\\ ] ] where the capital indices denote internal vectors , that is , vectors in a fiducial 3 dimensional vector space @xmath38 .",
    "the field @xmath39 is the soldering form that maps internal vectors to tangent vectors to the 3 manifold @xmath13 : @xmath40 . in the internal vector space @xmath38",
    "there is a fixed fiducial metric @xmath41 whose signature coincides with the one of the space - time metric .",
    "therefore , in the case of euclidean gravity @xmath42 and for lorentzian signature it is the 3 dimensional minkowski metric @xmath43 with signature @xmath44 .",
    "there is an lorentz invariant ( or rotation invariant in the euclidean case ) volume element @xmath45 in @xmath38 defined from @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath46 with `` upstairs '' indices is defined from @xmath45 by `` raising the indices '' with @xmath47 .",
    "we can recover the space - time metric @xmath48 from the soldering form @xmath49 , @xmath50 finally , @xmath51 is the curvature @xmath52form of the connection @xmath53 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 .",
    "the variation of ( [ actionx ] ) with respect to @xmath55 yields , @xmath56 and the equation from @xmath7 is , @xmath57 the first equation states that the torsion of @xmath6 vanishes , and implies that the covariant derivative defined by @xmath58 coincides with the one compatible with the co - triad , that is , @xmath59 .",
    "we can therefore replace @xmath60 by @xmath61 in ( [ ele2 ] ) and we arrive at einstein equations : @xmath62 recall that this equation implies that the space - time has constant scalar curvature proportional to @xmath34 : @xmath63 therefore , @xmath64 .",
    "note that this result is independent of the signature of the space - time and therefore , of the gauge group we are considering .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to use a fact from 3 dimensions : the dimensions of the `` lorentz group '' and the manifold coincide .",
    "that is , the lie algebra @xmath65 and the internal space @xmath38 can be identified .",
    "furthermore , the killing - cartan metric on the lie algebra @xmath66 is proportional to the internal metric @xmath41 .",
    "note that the connection is a `` lie - algebra valued '' @xmath36 form , and its components are labeled by two vectorial indices ( the natural labels in the vectorial or defining representation ) .",
    "however , in @xmath67 dimensions , the adjoint representation and the defining representation of @xmath65 coincide .",
    "it is simpler to work with @xmath36index labels ( the natural ones in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "we therefore define @xmath68 it is in this step that the euclidean and lorentzian theories have different expressions .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that we are using the internal metric @xmath69 to raise the indices of the @xmath45 in equation ( [ isom ] ) : @xmath70 .",
    "we can now rewrite the generalized covariant derivative in terms of @xmath71 as , @xmath72^i,\\ ] ] where @xmath73^i={\\epsilon^i}_{jk}\\,\\omega_\\mu^j\\,v^k$ ] . from ( [ isom ] )",
    "it also follows that the generalized curvature tensor two  form @xmath74 is , @xmath75    the palatini action can be rewritten as , @xmath76&= & \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_m \\left(2f(\\omega)_i\\wedge e^i   -\\epsilon_{ijk}\\frac{\\lambda_l}{3 } e^i\\wedge e^j",

    "this can be seen at different levels ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the easiest way of showing their equivalence is to generalize the observation of witten @xcite that one can define a new connection @xmath77 from the old connection @xmath78 and the co - triad @xmath7 , living on a larger lie algebra .",
    "this generalization , originally due to romano @xcite , can be applied to any action that has the structure of actions ( [ actionl ] ) and ( [ actiony ] ) .",
    "it is defined , in particular , for any semi - simple lie group @xmath79 and depends on a free parameter @xmath80 .",
    "form : @xmath81 . ] .",
    "the result is that any such action is equal to a chern - simons action based on the @xmath80-extension , @xmath82 , of the original group @xmath79 . for the cases of interest , that is , for the groups @xmath83 and @xmath84 , their @xmath80-extension coincide , being the group @xmath1 , when @xmath85 .",
    "the gravity actions can be put in the @xmath86 form if we construct the @xmath87 field from the drei - bein @xmath7 as follows : @xmath88 .",
    "then , the gravity actions ( [ actionl]),([actiony ] ) give rise to the _ same _ chern - simons action when @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for details of this equivalence ,",
    "manifested also at the phase space level see @xcite .",
    "the other cases give rise to the groups @xmath91 when @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and @xmath94 when @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    in this note",
    "we shall restrict our attention to the cases in which the @xmath80-extension corresponds to the _ de - sitter _",
    "group @xmath1 . ] .",
    "solutions to the equation of the motion coming from the chern - simons action are flat connections , and two solutions related by a gauge transformation are regarded as physically indistinguishable . thus , the physical phase space @xmath97 is the moduli space of flat @xmath1 connections or , in other words , the homomorphisms from @xmath98 to @xmath1 ( modulo the adjoint action of the group ) .",
    "there are several remarks .",
    "first , a point in @xmath97 represents both ( an equivalence class of ) lorentzian space - times ( 3-geometries ) with a _ positive _ cosmological constant and euclidean space - times with a _ negative _ cosmological constant !",
    "thus , there exists , at the fundamental level , a mathematical equivalence between the two theories .",
    "it is precisely this duality that we shall explore in this note .",
    "second , it is no coincidence that the group @xmath1 appears as the chern - simons gauge group , since it is also the global symmetry group of the de - sitter ( ds ) space in three dimensions .",
    "in fact , one knows that a space - time of the desired topology can be found by appropriate identifications and/or quotients of the ds space by a subgroup of the @xmath1 group @xcite .",
    "the relation between the elements of the group @xmath79 , associated to every non - contractible loop , and the quotient construction is what allows us to reconstruct a spacetime given a set of group elements .",
    "furthermore , one is able to reconstruct _ two _ space - times : one lorentzian ( @xmath99 ) and one euclidean ( @xmath12 ) . for",
    ", the global de - sitter solutions can be viewed as embedded in four dimensional minkowski space - time ; the lorentzian de - sitter ( @xmath100 ) is the hyperboloid defined by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 , and the euclidean de - sitter ( @xmath103 ) can be taken as one of the hyperboloids defined by @xmath104 .",
    "it is easy to see that the scalar curvature of these space - times is positive for @xmath100 and negative for @xmath103 , so they are indeed solutions to the einstein equations ( [ einst ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that this  holonomy \" duality is , in a sense , complementary to the well known wick rotation ( analytic continuation ) . in this later case ,",
    "one in changing the signature of the embedding space so the symmetry group of the global , maximally extended , geometry is not preserved , whereas the sign of the cosmological constant , and therefore the scalar curvature , is preserved .",
    "for instance , the wick rotation of anti de sitter ( ads ) , a lorentzian space - time with @xmath12 and group @xmath105 is euclidean de - sitter @xmath103 for which @xmath12 and @xmath106 .",
    "in this section , we construct explicitly the duality mentioned in previous sections for a particular family of ( very well known ) solutions : the btz family . in the euclidean side this includes the btz black hole ( of positive mass ) , going through the zero mass solution and the so called  mass gap \" finishing with the global euclidean de - sitter .",
    "we shall study their lorentzian duals and comment on their thermodynamic properties .",
    "the lorentzian de sitter spacetime @xmath100 can be defined as the surface @xmath107 embedded in the four dimensional minkowski spacetime with line element , @xmath108    the topology of the space - time is @xmath109 .",
    "this spacetime is maximally symmetric , i.e. , it has six killing vectors ( three rotations and three boosts ) , which form a @xmath1 isometry group .",

    "the spacetime is a two sphere that contracts to its minimum area @xmath116 at @xmath117 and then expands again .    in spite of the convenience of working on a globally defined coordinate patch",

    "we do this in order to illustrate the procedure that will lead to the ( one parameter family of ) dual lorentzian cosmological space - times . for simplicity we shall consider the non - rotating black hole . the rotating case can be found in the appendix .",
    "the starting point is euclidean de sitter @xmath103 ( [ 4.13 ] ) .",
    "next , we consider the killing vector field , @xmath154 which generates boosts in the plane @xmath155 and it is tangent to the de sitter space . note that @xmath156 .",
    "let us now define the embedding ( [ 4.17 ] ) , changing the names of the coordinates as follows , @xmath157 we have the line element , @xmath158 \\label{met}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",

    "the metric ( [ met ] ) induces naturally the topology @xmath137 over the region covered by the embedding ( [ btz : emb ] ) .",

    "we see that the temperature that we should assign is , @xmath183 finally , the mass of the space - time is @xmath184 , where the value @xmath185 is assigned , as usual , to the solution with @xmath186 .",
    "the following questions come to mind : what is the relation between this construction and the reduced phase space in terms of @xmath187 ? in what sense",
    "can we say that the holonomies along the orbits of @xmath163 are related to the parameter @xmath188 ?",
    "the relation between the appearance of this non - trivial holonomies and the construction described above deserves more attention .",
    "the procedure involves the construction of a 3-dimensional space - time @xmath13 , out of a point of the reduced phase space .",
    "this procedure naturally implies some sort of  gauge fixing \" in order to select a representative form the equivalence class of flat @xmath1 connections , that will have a corresponding space - time locally isometric to @xmath189 . to see that the space - time constructed via identifications has associated to it a flat @xmath1 connection whose holonomies parameterize the reduced phase space we need to use the structure available in @xmath189 .",

    "the hyperboloids corresponding to de - sitter space - times are invariant subspaces of the @xmath1 action @xmath190 , and the group acts transitively .",
    "that is , given any two points @xmath193 and @xmath194 on @xmath13 , we can always find an element @xmath195 such that @xmath196 .",
    "let us now define a canonical ( auxiliary ) 3-d flat connection on @xmath13 as follows : given an open curve @xmath197 on @xmath13 , with @xmath193 as its starting point and @xmath194 as its end point , and an initial vector @xmath198 , we parallel transport the vector using the flat @xmath1 connection of the embedding space - time .",

    "even though the construction procedure is different from the one used in the btz case , the picture of having an element of @xmath1 , the holonomy , for each non - contractible loop remains unchanged .",

    "the ` holonomy ' transform ( h - duality ) corresponds to the diagonal ` h ' arrows going from the lower - left corner to the upper right corner and relating the space - times studied in this note .",
    "there are several remarks that need to be made .    1 .",
    "_ relation to wick transform_. as already discussed , the standard wick transform and the holonomy duality are in a sense , complementary .",
    "first , the wick - duality for space - times is restricted to complex space - times that admit both an euclidean and a lorentzian real section .",
    "normally this is possible only in the presence of a time - like kvf .",
    "furthermore , the mapping in not strictly between globally defined space - times , since , for instance , it is only the exterior region of the lorentzian btz black hole that gets  mapped \" to the euclidean sector . on the other hand ,",
    "the holonomy transform , being a duality at the phase space level , relates globally defined space - times .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a kvf is not essential for the definition of the duality .",
    "the wick rotation has been extensively used in gravitational physics . not only is it used for qft calculations , but also in connection with gravitational thermodynamics .",
    "standard arguments of hawking and gibbons @xcite assign a temperature to the lorentzian space - time by looking at the period of the wick - rotated time in the dual space - time .",
    "this physical equivalence between space - times is used regularly in the study of thermodynamics of black holes .",
    "one may wonder if the holonomy dual space - times can be regarded as having more than just the phase - space equivalence .",
    "is it justified to assign thermodynamical properties to the dual space - time to define , say , a temperature and entropy for space - times that do not even have a horizon ?",
    "can we perform a calculation in one domain and conclude something about the other domain just as we do with the wick transform ?",
    "+ affirmative answers to this intriguing questions would indeed be of some interest since we could , for instance , pass from the physics in @xmath3 to @xmath279 composing a @xmath38 and a @xmath280-transform .",
    "what would the relevance be for an hypothetical @xmath281 conjecture remains an open question .",
    "thermodynamics_. let us elaborate on the possible assignment of a temperature to the space - times studied in previous section .",
    "let us first recall the standard argument to define a physical temperature for a euclidean space - time .",
    "first , we start we a lorentzian stationary black - hole space - time , with an @xmath282-dimensional ( null ) horizon ( with @xmath283 being the dimension of space - time ) . in the euclidean sector , the horizon is now @xmath284 dimensional and ` time ' is a periodic coordinate .",
    "one asks for regularity of the space - time at the horizon in order to fix the periodicity of the euclidean time . even if we start with a euclidean solution with non - trivial topology , the fact that it is regular is not enough to define a temperature .",
    "we need , as in the schwarzschild black hole case , the lorentzian time that _ measures proper time at infinity _ in order to have the ` right ' temperature .",
    "the same is true for the de - sitter space - time where one needs to choose the time - parameter as the proper time of the observer whose cosmological horizon we want to consider .",
    "the periodicity of the wick - transformed time is then related to the temperature .",
    "+ let us now consider the space - times of interest for this note .",
    "the ( non - rotating ) euclidean btz solutions have a naturally defined temperature @xmath285 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath280-dual space - time is a spatially closed space - time , with no time - like kvf and no horizon .",
    "one may wonder what , if any , would be the meaning of formally defining thermodynamic parameters and , in particular , a _",
    "constant _ temperature to the whole space - time .",
    "we shall return to this question shortly .",
    "+ the lorentzian de - sitter space - time together with the point particle solutions ( [ 3.32 ] ) have horizons with a temperature ( assigned via the wick rotation ) given by @xmath286 . the dual space - times ( [ 3.33 ] )",
    "do not have a periodic ` time ' coordinate @xmath31 and therefore , no natural temperature .",
    "however , if we declare the temperature of this space - times to be @xmath287 , ( i.e. , the temperature of its @xmath280-dual ) then the natural period for @xmath31 is @xmath288 .",
    "now , the space - times ( [ 3.33 ] ) are the wick transform of the family of point particle @xmath3 space - time ( with @xmath289 ) . therefore ,",
    "using the standard wick transform argument , we can assign a temperature to the family of point - particle-@xmath3 space - times to be , @xmath290 note that with this definition , the @xmath3 space - time ( corresponding to @xmath291 and @xmath254 ) is a ` thermal state ' with temperature @xmath292 , recovering the suggestion of strominger and others @xcite .",
    "+ in recent years there have been several attempts to calculate the entropy of the btz black hole .",
    "one of those calculations , originally due to carlip @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , starts by considering the @xmath293 chern - simons phase space for a @xmath170 space - time .",
    "then , one imposes boundary conditions , motivated by the lorentz black hole horizon , and computes the bekenstein - hawking entropy using the wzw theory induced on the horizon .",
    "one intriguing fact about this calculation is that , in the euclidean domain , one does not have the geometrical interpretation of the lorentzian horizon , and without the knowledge of its origin , we would only be faced with some boundary conditions on phase space inducing a wzw theory on the boundary . + since the @xmath280-duality is precisely based on the fact that the two gravity theories share the same phase space , then we could perfectly well interpret the result of the calculation as giving us the entropy of the lorentzian cosmological space - time .",
    "the correspondence is given as follows .",
    "the horizon @xmath165 of the euclidean black hole corresponds in the lorentzian side to the initial @xmath20 singularity ( this is a striking property , because @xmath20 is a _ chronological _ singularity and the horizon @xmath165 , is just a coordinate singularity ) .",
    "this singularity is a mild one , since it is manifested by the fact that the spatial slice is a degenerate torus . if would be of interest to geometrically interpret the boundary conditions in the lorentzian theory and to identify the calculated entropy with some geometrical invariant , the analogous of the horizon area in the bh case .",
    "+ another interesting calculation refers to the entropy associated to the cosmological horizon in de - sitter .",
    "the first approach , very much in the style of carlip is given in @xcite .",
    "maldacena and strominger again impose some boundary conditions in the @xmath293 chern - simons phase space and compute the bekenstein - hawking entropy using the cft on the boundary of the region , in this case , the horizon .",
    "the computed entropy is , as expected , one fourth of the cosmological horizon radius , @xmath294 .",
    "the other calculation @xcite computes the gibbons - hawking entropy by considering the partition function in the wick - rotated theory ( corresponding to a chern - simons theory on @xmath295 ) .",
    "the maldacena - strominger results can be re - interpreted in the same way that carlip s results were ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "that is , one can argue that the calculation very well applies to the @xmath280-dual theory , namely , to a euclidean de - sitter space - time with topology @xmath296 ( [ 3.33 ] ) , and assigns to it an entropy @xmath297 .",
    "now , recall that these space - times are the wick - duals of the point particle @xmath3 space - times , and therefore one is naturally lead to assign to these space - times an entropy as well . for the global @xmath3 the associated entropy would be @xmath298 . just as for the cosmological space - times , we would like to interpret this entropy in geometrical terms . 3 .",
    "_ path integrals , wick rotations , etc .. _ the fact that three dimensional gravity has a dual description , both as a theory of triads and connections @xmath299 and as a theory of space - time metrics , poses a puzzle .",
    "on the one hand , there is the not so unpopular wisdom that there is a deep relation between the lorentzian and euclidean path integral formulation of gravity .",
    "independently of the viewpoint one adopts , be it that the euclidean path integral is useful for calculating lorentzian transition amplitudes , or that the euclidean regime is fundamental , there is some belief that euclidean methods are relevant for quantum gravity and bh - thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , this is the standard justification for the extended use of the wick - rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "when the theory is formulated as a diffeomorphism invariant theory of connections , one looses even the notion of a space - time metric ; it now becomes a _",
    "derived _ notion and , therefore , the role of the wick rotation turns out to be not so obvious ( see @xcite ) . for , in the completely solvable models like @xmath86 theories and @xmath0 gravity with no cosmological constant , the rigorously defined measures on the space of histories",
    "have heuristic analogs involving a factor of the form @xmath300 for both gauge groups ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , so the signature of the space - time metric seems to play no role .",
    "if one takes the viewpoint that the heuristic path integrals based on the actions ( [ actionl ] , [ actiony ] ) fully represent quantum gravity in three dimensions , then one is naturally lead to conclude that the @xmath280-duality is , in a sense , more fundamental and natural than the wick transform .",
    "for , the @xmath280-dual theories not only share the space of histories , in their chern - simons version , but also have the property that the actions ( [ actionl],[actiony ] ) , when evaluated on the shared history , differ only by a sign @xcite . thus , _ the path integral for these two actions must be equivalent _ ( since the factor involved is of the form @xmath300 and the actions are real )",
    ".    implications of the previous discussion are intriguing .",
    "first , one can justify the formal assignments of thermodynamical properties like entropy and temperature to cases where , classically , there is no time - like kvf and no horizon .",
    "this can be done by applying the standard arguments of gibbons - hawking together with the @xmath280-duality@xcite .",
    "second , there seems to be some tension between the relevance of the wick transform for quantum gravity in its metrical / geometrodynamical formulation and the holonomy duality for its connection - dynamics formulation",
    ". it would be of interest to fully understand the role of these dualities in the context of path integrals for diffeomorphism invariant theories .",
    "finally , we could speculate about some implications for the @xmath280-dual of the @xmath301 correspondence and what it could tell us about quantum gravity in higher dimensions .",

    "<S> we use this duality to construct a mapping between apparently unrelated space - times . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we exhibit a relation between the euclidean btz family and some @xmath2-cosmological solutions , and between de - sitter point particle space - times and the analytic continuations of anti - de sitter point particles . </S>",
