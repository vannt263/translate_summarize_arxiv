    "it is important to understand the structure of class 0 objects since they represent the earliest phase of star formation .",

    "several kinds of fragmentation mechanisms have been suggested , including rotational fragmentation , turbulent fragmentation , and disk fragmentation ( goodwin et al .",

    "source 3 is unresolved .",
    "since it was not detected in other wavelengths , the nature of source 3 is unclear .      in low - mass star forming regions ,",
    "continuum emission in the centimeter - millimeter band is usually either free - free radiation from hot ionized gas or thermal radiation from cold dust , or a combination of both .",
    "the free - free emission usually has a small ( @xmath211 ) spectral index , while the dust emission has a large ( @xmath222 ) spectral index ( reynolds 1986 ; anglada et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the sed was examined to investigate the emission mechanism of hh 24 mms . since sources 1 and 2 are resolved in the 6.9 mm band only , sed of the whole hh 24 mms system was constructed .",
    "the total flux of the hh 24 mms system , measured in a 4@xmath0 @xmath6 4@xmath0 box , is 12.0 @xmath5 0.5 mjy ( from the map shown in fig .",
    "1@xmath18 ) , and the sed in the wavelength range of 3.6 cm to 3.4 mm is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we first tried to fit the sed of hh 24 mms as a sum of two power - law components , one from the free - free emission and the other from the dust emission , over the wavelength range of 3.4 mm to 3.6 cm ( 8.388 ghz ) .",
    "the best fit has spectral indices of 2.1 @xmath5 0.3 and 3.7 @xmath5 0.2 ( fig .",
    "2 _ left panel _ ) .",
    "it was found that acceptable fits can only have large ( @xmath232 ) spectral indices for both components , which clearly means that the emission is mostly from dust and that the free - free emission is negligible in the wavelength range considered .",
    "then , as the dust emission seems to be dominating even in the centimeter wavelengths , the sed was fitted again with a single - component power - law distribution .",
    "the fits were made using three data points , excluding the 3.6 cm data , to avoid any contribution from free - free emission .",
    "the best fit has a spectral index of @xmath24 = 2.8 @xmath5 0.2 in the millimeter range ( fig .",
    "2 _ right panel _ ) .    extrapolating the best - fit sed to longer wavelengths ,",
    "a substantial fraction ( @xmath190% ) of the 3.6 cm flux seems to come from the dust emission .",
    "therefore , the free - free emission , if any , must be very weak .",
    "if 10% of the 3.6 cm flux comes from optically thin free - free emission , its contribution to the 6.9 mm flux would be only @xmath10.2% ( or 0.02 mjy ) .",
    "that is , the 6.9 mm flux of hh 24 mms is almost entirely from dust .",
    "as the millimeter continuum flux is mostly from dust , the mass of the emission structure can be estimated from the sed . to derive the mass from the dust continuum flux ,",
    "the mass opacity given by beckwith & sargent ( 1991 ) is assumed , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the frequency , @xmath27 = 1200 ghz , and @xmath28 is the opacity index .",
    "this opacity is for total mass of gas and dust .",
    "the opacity index of hh 24 mms is @xmath29 .",
    "this small value of @xmath28 implies the presence of large dust grains probably caused by the grain growth in the high density environment ( e.g. , miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) , which was pointed out by several authors previously ( chandler et al .",
    "1995 ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "1995 ) .    the dust temperature , @xmath30 , used in previous works ranges from 12 k to 100 k ( phillips et al . 2001 ; chandler et al .",
    "1995 ) . here",
    "we adopt @xmath30 = 20 @xmath5 5 k from ward - thompson et al .",
    "in the 6.9 mm maps , the peak brightness temperature is about 8 k , and the mean brightness temperature in a 4@xmath0 @xmath6 4@xmath0 box is less than 1 k. since the brightness temperature is much lower than the dust temperature , the optical depth of the 6.9 mm continuum emission must be small . assuming optically thin emission , the mass can be estimated by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the flux density , @xmath33 is the distance to the source , and @xmath34 is the planck function .",
    "assuming @xmath33 = 400 pc , the total mass is 1.4@xmath35 @xmath36 , which is consistent with the mass estimate of chandler et al .",
    "this mass includes both the accretion disk(s ) and the inner protostellar envelope .",
    "at the first glance of the 6.9 mm maps , the hh 24 mms system appears like a combination of a protostar ( source 1 ) and an outflow ( source 2 ) .",
    "however , the sed shows that , for both sources 1 and 2 , the 6.9 mm flux is mostly from dust .",
    "especially , the 6.9 mm flux of source 2 must be entirely from dust because the 3.6 cm source is not associated with source 2 ( fig .",
    "1@xmath20 ) .",
    "that is , it is very unlikely that source 2 is a thermal jet .",
    "since both sources are extended and partially overlapping , a simple two - component fitting to the image was done to decompose the system .",
    "the image was fitted with a sum of two elliptical gaussian distributions .",
    "only the pixels around source 1 and 2 with intensities above 0.3 mjy beam@xmath19 were considered for the fit , and source 3 was ignored .",
    "table 1 lists the parameters of the best - fit gaussian profiles , and figure 1@xmath37 shows the best - fit intensity distribution , which agrees with the observed image within three times the rms noise .",
    "the total flux of the two - component gaussian profile also agrees with that of the real image within 0.1 mjy .",
    "there is a bipolar jet seen in h@xmath4 emission in the hh 24 mms region with the axis in the northeast - southwest direction ( bontemps et al .",
    "the near - ir h@xmath4 map of davis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows that hh 24 mms is almost certainly the driving source of this outflow .",
    "the position angle of these h@xmath4 knots ( ne 1 , ne 2 , and sw 2 ) with respect to hh 24 mms is 32  @xmath5 6 , which is perpendicular to the elongation of source 1 .",
    "therefore , source 1 seems to be the driving source of the bipolar outflow .",
    "the peak position of the 3.6 cm source ( reipurth et al .",
    "2002 ) does not exactly coincide with the position of source 1 ( fig .",
    "1@xmath20 ) .",
    "the position displacement is about 0.7@xmath0 .",
    "since the 3.6 cm source is weak and extended ( @xmath11@xmath0 ) , it is not clear that the displacement is significant . in this paper",
    "we assume that the 3.6 cm source is identical to or closely associated with source 1 , but we can not rule out the possibility that the 3.6 cm source indicates the existence of yet another young stellar object .",
    "this issue should be resolved by more sensitive observations of the centimeter continuum in the future .",
    "for source 2 , three kinds of interpretation are possible .",
    "( 1 ) source 2 is another protostar with a projected separation of 360 au from source 1 .",
    "( 2 ) source 2 is a clump of dust swept and heated by the outflow .",
    "( 3 ) source 2 has multiple clumps in the dense envelope as seen in other protostars such as ngc 1333 iras 4b ( looney et al .",
    "the first possibility seems to be the simplest explanation .",
    "the second possibility is rather unlikely because the position angle of the elongation of source 2 ( @xmath169 ) is different from the direction of the outflow by @xmath140 .",
    "in addition , the mass of source 2 seems too large for a clump around outflow .",
    "the third possibility can only be tested by imaging with a higher resolution , but it is rather peculiar that only one side of the envelope has dense clumps .",
    "therefore , we prefer the interpretation that hh 24 mms may be a protostellar binary system , and we will adopt this interpretation in the following discussions .",
    "the separation between sources 1 and 2 is within the range of the expected separation of young binaries . in a few examples of well - studied class 0 protostars , observations and modeling",
    "suggest that the centrifugal radius ranges from 34 au to 600 au ( see myers et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "reipurth et al .",
    "( 2004 ) carried out a radio - continuum survey of embedded objects with distances between 140 and 800 pc and found many binaries with separations ranging from 0.5@xmath0 to 12@xmath0 .",
    "many numerical simulations of core fragmentation produce multiple systems with separations of a few hundreds of au ( goodwin et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "both components of hh 24 mms are highly elongated , with axial ratios of 3 for source 1 and 8 for source 2 , which suggests that each of them may be a disk - like flattened structure viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "the size of each component is somewhat larger than the expected size of an accretion disk supported by keplerian rotation ( @xmath1100 au ) , and each of the 6.9 mm continuum sources may consist of a compact accretion disk surrounded by a flattened inner envelope or a pseudodisk ( a contracting disk - like structure that is not completely supported by rotation ; galli & shu 1993 ; tomisaka 2002 ; allen et al .",
    "2003 ) . assuming that the dust properties of each source are not very different from the overall dust properties of the hh 24 mms system",
    ", the mass can be derived from the flux of each source ( table 1 ) .",
    "the majority of stars belong to multiple - star systems ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , and understanding of star formation can not be complete without knowing the physical processes in multiple - protostar systems ( tohline 2002 ) .",
    "study of the protobinary in the earliest evolutionary stage is essential in understanding how the fragmentation occurs and what is the initial condition of the binary evolution .",
    "there are two main mechanisms for fragmentation : ( 1 ) rotational fragmentation and ( 2 ) turbulent fragmentation ( goodwin et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the outcome of these two mechanisms can be quite different .",
    "the former occurs when the kinematics of the initial core is dominated by systematic rotation , and the resulting binary would be well - ordered , i.e. , disks would be well - aligned .",
    "in contrast , the latter occurs when the core is dominated by random motions , and the resulting binary is likely to have misaligned disks .",
    "therefore , the alignment of disks is one of the key observational measures that can provide strong constraints on the fragmentation mechanism .    in principle",
    ", multiple outflows can give some implications on the degree of binary disk alignment because outflows are ejected perpendicular to the circumstellar disks .",
    "there are some examples of misaligned systems inferred from jets emanating with different position angles ( gredel & reipurth 1993 ; reipurth et al .",
    "however , this method is problematic because two well - aligned outflows would be misidentified as a single outflow .",
    "the best way to test the disk alignment may be the direct imaging of both disks .",
    "if hh 24 mms is a binary system as discussed in the previous section , it is one of the rare examples of protobinary system imaged with an angular resolution high enough to investigate the degree of alignment .",
    "each source may consist of a compact accretion disk surrounded by a pseudodisk , and the axis of the accretion disk is very likely to be parallel to the axis of the pseudodisk around it .",
    "then the axis direction of the accretion disk can be inferred from the minor axis of the elliptical fit to the 6.9 mm source .",
    "the major axes of the two components of the hh 24 mms system are not aligned at all .",
    "the difference in the position angle between the binary components , from the gaussian fit ( table 1 ) , is @xmath145  ( or @xmath1135  if they are retrograde ) .",
    "24 mms makes a stark contrast to the other known example of resolved binary disks , l1551 irs 5 . in the l1551 irs 5 system , the two disks are very well aligned ( rodrguez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the difference between the two systems is probably owing to the binary separation : 360 au in hh 24 mms and 45 au in l1551 irs 5 . in the classification scheme of multiple young stellar objects suggested by looney et al . ( 2000 ) , hh 24 mms belongs to the common - envelope type while l1551 irs 5 belongs to the common - disk type .",
    "we speculate that the rotational fragmentation is important in close binaries and the turbulent fragmentation is important in wide binaries , though more examples are certainly needed to draw a statistically significant conclusion . other examples may include iras 162932422 and ngc 1333 iras 4a ( looney et al .",
    "2000 ) , but their structures are complicated and their disk orientations are less obvious .",
    "though studies through direct imaging is difficult , indirect evidences show that misaligned systems are not necessarily unusual .",
    "high - resolution near - ir polarimetry revealed plenty of examples of misaligned binaries in the class ii phase ( monin et al .",
    "2007 ) . disks in t tauri binaries are not perfectly coplanar ( jensen et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the relative alignment of the disks may decrease after formation ( bate et al .",
    "therefore , hh 24 mms can be considered as a _ precursor _ of such misaligned t tauri systems .",
    "as hh 24 mms is a rare example of a wide binary that can be imaged well enough to study the disk alignment , this system gives us a chance to examine the initial conditions of binary evolution .",

    "<S> the hh 24 mms protostellar system was observed in the 6.9 mm continuum with a high angular resolution ( 0.5@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hh 24 mms was resolved into two sources . </S>",
    "<S> the separation between sources 1 and 2 is @xmath10.9@xmath0 or 360 au . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distribution suggests that the 6.9 mm flux is almost entirely from dust . </S>",
    "<S> the 6.9 mm image and the spectrum suggest that hh 24 mms may be a protostellar binary system . </S>",
    "<S> total mass including the accretion disks and the inner protostellar envelope is @xmath11.4 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> disk masses of sources 1 and 2 are 0.6 and 0.3 @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both sources are highly elongated . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the position angle of the two disks is @xmath145 , which means that hh 24 mms is a highly misaligned protobinary system . </S>",
    "<S> the misalignment suggests that turbulent fragmentation may be the formation mechanism relevant to the binary systems with a separation of a few hundreds of au , such as the hh 24 mms system . </S>"
