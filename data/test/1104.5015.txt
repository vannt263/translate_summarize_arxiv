    "recently , a method for constraining non - gaussianity from large - scale structure surveys has been proposed @xcite , which exploits the fact that the clustering of dark matter halos where galaxies form on large scales is modified in a scale - dependent way by the presence of even small amount of non - gaussianity .",

    "large - scale structure ( lss ) surveys covering large volumes are needed to access the scales where the signal arises ( e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility of using high redshift data to constrain non - gaussianity has also been addressed by means of hydrodynamic simulations of the intergalactic medium @xcite . among the many currently - available tracers of the lss , the radio sources from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite and the quasar catalogue of the sloan digital sky survey release six ( sdss dr6 qsos ) @xcite are particularly interesting since they span large volumes extending out to substantial redshifts @xcite .",
    "indeed these source samples were shown to provide tight constraints on primordial non - gaussianity by the cross - correlation measurements between cmb temperature fluctuations and the lss number density which could be used to detect the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) @xcite effect @xcite .    in recent papers",

    "this is because the acf is found to be still positive on angular scales @xmath22 , which , for the median source redshift ( @xmath23 ) , correspond to linear scales where the correlation function should be negative if the density fluctuation field is gaussian . a positive @xmath7 adds power on large angular scales , accounting for the observed acf .",
    "in this paper , we will revisit the constraints on the primordial non - gaussianity from these two lss tracers using the power spectrum @xmath0 , instead of the correlation function @xmath24 .",
    "while it is true that the angular correlation function and the angular power spectrum are spherical harmonic pairs and thus in principle they should enclose the same physical information , each of the two measurements is affected by systematic errors in different ways .",
    "for example the correlation function is less affected by the survey mask than the power spectrum but error estimation for the power spectrum is much easier then for the correlation function .",
    "a direct comparison of parameter constraints obtained via the correlation function and the power spectrum analyses offer therefore a way to quantify possible systematic effects .",

    "the factor @xmath39 for the enfolded template is proportional to @xmath41 , while the equilateral template gives an almost scale - independent @xmath39 .",
    "it is important to note here that the equilateral and enfolded templates were created to have factorizable expressions that gave a good description of the actual bispectra , on average , over all configurations .",
    "for the the halo bias effect , nearly squeezed configurations dominate . as discussed e.g. , in ref .",

    "the orthogonal template instead scales like @xmath17 in the squeezed limit .",

    "when we combine these three observed angular power spectra data together to constrain non - gaussianity , we obtain a limit of @xmath198 at 68% confidence level and @xmath199 at 95% confidence level , which implies the current angular power spectra of lss tracers favor @xmath15 at the @xmath200 level , since non - gaussianity adds power on large angular scales yielding a good fit to the observed data points .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : data1 ] and table [ tab : i ] , there is not a specific measurement that is driving the signal : all the different probes yield very consistent results and when combined the error bar on @xmath7 is reduced to yield a @xmath201 result .",
    "comparing with the angular power spectrum , the constraining power of cross - correlation power spectrum on @xmath7 is much weaker @xcite . in the panels of figure [ fig : data2 ] , we plot the observed cross - correlation power spectra @xmath126 among three lss tracers and @xmath136 between the cmb map and three lss tracers .",

    ", we explore other two different types of primordial non - gaussianity given by the equilateral and enfolded templates .",
    "the equilateral type of non - gaussianity @xcite , which can be generated from the inflationary models with higher - derivative operators of the inflaton , can be well described by the following template @xcite : @xmath214 , where @xmath215^{2/3}+(p_\\phi(k_1)^{1/3}p_\\phi(k_2)^{2/3}p_\\phi(k_3)+5cyc)~.\\ ] ] then we find that the correction @xmath208 in the equilateral non - gaussian case is almost scale - independent ( see figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in principle",
    "there is a mass dependence ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the template and the actual physical bispectrum yield different effective @xmath7 ( denoted by @xmath216 ) for the halo bias . here , therefore , we consider a phenomenological scale - independent scaling and neglect the mass dependence .",
    "the interpretation of the resulting constraint should be interpreted as a constraint on an effective @xmath7 , its connection to the physical bispectrum depends on the detailed model of inflation under consideration .",
    "using all datasets , we obtain the constraint on the equilateral type of primordial non - gaussianity : @xmath217 which is consistent with the wmap7 results @xcite .",
    "the template of another type of non - gaussianity `` enfolded '' , which arises in models with non - bunch - davies initial state @xcite or in effective field theories of inflation with higher - derivative interactions @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is given by ref .",

    "@xcite , it can be seen that the correction in this type is proportion to @xmath220 on large scales .",
    "no single field inflationary model has this scaling in the squeezed limit : all inflationary single field models considered so far have only the local or the template equilateral scaling in this limit @xcite .",
    "this is nevertheless an interesting intermediate case to consider .",
    "in fact non - single field models can yield all the intermediate scalings in the squeezed limit , see e.g. , ref .",
    "we therefore consider a phenomenological scaling like @xmath220 which could cover this enfolded template case and neglect the mass dependence . in this case",
    ", the whole data sets give the constraint on the effective non - gaussianity parameter for the enfolded template : @xmath221 in the wmap7 paper @xcite , a constraint on the orthogonal type of non - gaussianity @xcite is given .",
    "the correction to the halo bias of this template is also proportional to @xmath220 on large scales , but have the opposite sign and a normalization factor of @xmath222 with a weak mass dependence which we neglect here .",
    "therefore , based on the result of enfolded template , in our simple analysis , we obtain the constraint on the non - gaussianity parameter for the orthogonal template : @xmath223 ( @xmath182 ) and @xmath224 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the orthogonal type of non - gaussianity in the squeezed limit however scales like the equilateral one and , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite its effect on the halo bias is almost degenerate with the equilateral non - gaussianity .",
    "the enfolded type of non - gaussianity arising for example from modified initial state , in the squeezed limit scales like the local template and as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite its effect on the halo bias is almost degenerate with the local non - gaussianity but with a different normalization @xmath225 .",
    "this re - scaling can be used to re - interpret the local constraints into constraints for the modified initial state non - gaussianity .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of the cubic correction on the halo bias model . in this case , the bardeen potential @xmath9 can be conveniently parameterized up to third order by : @xmath227 where @xmath226 is dimensionless , phenomenological parameter .",
    "@xcite explored the effect of a cubic correction @xmath5 on the mass function and halo bias model in detail and gave the expression of the scale - dependent bias correction when @xmath228 and @xmath229 : @xmath230 where the normalized skewness of the density field @xmath231 and the parameter @xmath232 obtained by the fitting in ref . @xcite .",

    "this effect is called non - gaussian halo bias . to access these large scales ,",
    "large - scale structure surveys covering large volumes , high redshift and tracers of massive halos are most suited . among the currently available surveys , the nvss and the sdss qso ( in particular the dr6 catalog ) are the largest .",
    "previous work had detected excess large - scale power in their auto - correlation function yielding a detection of a positive value of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath7 at @xmath259 level .",
    "here we have revisited the issue using the angular power spectrum rather than the correlation function . while the two statistics should enclose the same physical information they are affected by systematics effects in different ways : this complementary analysis offers thus a consistency check and a test for possible systematics .",
    "we have also used the recently updated megaz - lrg survey : a previous release of the same survey had also been found to have excess large - scale power , but mostly at @xmath118 . in an effort to be as conservative as possible in our analysis , we excuded all multipoles at @xmath118 : these multipoles are affected by theoretical uncertainties and systematics such as calibration , sample contamination etc .",
    "these also probe the largest scales , thus these are the multipoles where most of the non - gaussian signal is likely to be concentrated .",
    "we combine the survey auto power spectra with the cross - power spectra among the surveys and of each of the survey with the cmb temperature map . in our analysis",
    "we marginalize over the lcdm cosmological parameters with a prior imposed by wmap7 angular power spectra , bao , supernovae and hubble constant measurement .",

    "we have also considered constraints on a cubic non - gaussianity correction ( parameterized by the @xmath226 parameter ) .",
    "we find no evidence for non - gaussianity for any `` shape '' which halo bias effect on large scale scales less steeply than @xmath17 and no evidence for non - zero @xmath226 .",
    "however for the local type of non - gaussianity we find a @xmath260 signal for positive @xmath7 when all data - sets are combined .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig : fnl ] : no single data set drives the signal and the central @xmath7 values recovered are fully in agreement with previous analyses . due to the more conservative approach taken here ( and thus larger error - bars ) , the only single survey that yield more than @xmath261 detection is the sdss dr7 qso survey . the nvss survey central recovered @xmath7 value is also in agreement with both the qso measurement and previous analyses but the error - bar is larger .",
    "the combination of the data sets yields : @xmath262 and @xmath263 at @xmath264 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus the tantalizing hint for a positive local @xmath7 found from the auto - correlation function remains despite the different analysis .",
    "we have investigated several possible sources of systematic errors such as the sources number density and the contamination by galactic emissions for nvss sources ; different choices for the cmb temperature fluctuations templates ; possible contamination of stars for the sdss and lrg samples .",
