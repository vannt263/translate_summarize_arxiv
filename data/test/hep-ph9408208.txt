    "neutrinos , pauli s little neutral ones , have already reached adolescence , and they may eventually be regarded as the most elucidative indicators of new astrophysical phenomena . in this review ,",
    "some of the astrophysical implications of neutrino mass and mixings are discussed .    only certain values of neutrino mass and mixings give rise to interesting astrophysical effects .",
    "one should raise the question if these values are realistic .",
    "unfortunately we still do not have much experimental information about neutrino properties .",
    "the only _ measured _ neutrino property is the number of light neutrino flavors .",
    "it is determined from the invisible width of z to be @xcite    @xmath0    this number is consistent with the primordial nucleosynthesis limit from the observed he abundance @xcite .",
    "we have _ upper bounds _ for all the other neutrino properties : masses , flavor mixing angles , electromagnetic moments , charges , and charge radii . in particular , the mass of the heaviest neutrino , @xmath1 , is very poorly known : upper limit is 35 mev .",
    "a tau neutrino with a mass in the range of 1 to 10 ev could possibly be a significant component of dark matter and , as we shall see later , could also have very interesting implications for supernova dynamics .    in the next two sections",
    "first the status of solar neutrino problem is briefly reviewed , and then some recent developments concerning physics input to solar models are discussed . after reviewing the status of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , implications of neutrino mass and mixings in supernova dynamics are explored .",
    "finally neutrino propagation in inhomogeneous media is described and its implications for the sun and supernovae are considered .",
    "some of the energy released in the thermonuclear reactions in the solar interior is emitted in the form of neutrinos and this neutrino flux can be calculated with relatively high precision @xcite .",
    "this flux was measured @xcite and its directionality ( i.e. coming from the sun ) was established @xcite .",
    "however , the observed solar neutrino flux is deficient relative to what is predicted by the standard solar model . a summary of the current status of the solar neutrino experiments is given in table 1 .",
    "since the same thermonuclear reactions produce photons as well as neutrinos , assuming the dominance of the @xmath2 reaction , one can roughly estimate the flux of the neutrinos coming from this reaction from the solar photon luminosity to be    @xmath3    which indicates a ga capture rate greater than 78 snu s .",
    "inclusion of @xmath4be and @xmath5b neutrinos would increase this number .",
    ".the present status of solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the standard solar models ssm1 and ssm2 are taken from refs .",
    "[ 11 ] and [ 12 ] respectively .",
    "the gallex and sage quotes are combined results of initial and more recent runs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     experimentally the ratio of ratios , @xmath6 , appears to be independent of zenith angle .",
    "the observed zenith angle distribution of low energy atmospheric neutrinos is consistent with no oscillations or with a large number of oscillations for all source - detector distances .",
    "explanations of the low energy atmospheric neutrino anomaly based on the oscillation of 2 neutrino flavors require that the oscillating term @xcite , @xmath7 , average to zero for even the shortest source - detector distances ( @xmath8 km for neutrinos from directly overhead . ) for neutrinos in the energy range 0.1 to 1 gev this condition is satisfied for @xmath9 .",
    "if the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is resolved by the oscillations of muon into tau neutrinos , this value of @xmath10 is consistent with a tau neutrino mass relevant to hot dark matter and supernova dynamics .",
    "it is also possible to make a search in the three - neutrino - flavor parameter space and identify regions in this parameter space compatible with the existing atmospheric and solar neutrino data within the vacuum oscillation scheme @xcite .",
    "understanding neutrino transport in a supernova is an essential part of understanding supernova dynamics . in this review",
    ", i will only concentrate on the effects of neutrino flavor mixing on supernova dynamics .    in a core - collapse driven supernova , the inner core collapses subsonically , but the outer part of the core supersonically . at some point during the collapse ,",
    "when the nuclear equation of state stiffens , the inner part of the core bounces , but the outer core continues falling in .",
    "the shock wave generated at the boundary loses its energy as it expands by dissociating material falling through it into free nucleons and alpha particles . for a large initial core mass ,",
    "the shock wave gets stalled at @xmath11 200 to 500 km away from the center of the proto - neutron star @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the proto - neutron star , shrinking under its own gravity , loses energy by emitting neutrinos , which only interact weakly and can leak out on a relatively long diffusion time scale .",
    "the question to be investigated then is the possibility of regenerating the shock by neutrino heating .",
    "the situation at the onset of neutrino heating is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the density at the neutrinosphere is @xmath12 g @xmath13 and the density at the position of the stalled shock is @xmath14 g @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "writing the msw resonance density in appropriate units :    @xmath15    one sees that , for small mixing angles , @xmath16 mev , and cosmologically interesting @xmath17 ev@xmath18 , there is an msw resonance point between the neutrinosphere and the stalled shock .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the core are produced by a neutral current process , and so the luminosities are approximately the same for all flavors .",
    "the energy spectra are approximately fermi - dirac with a zero chemical potential characterized by a neutrinosphere temperature .",
    "the @xmath19 interact with matter only via neutral current interactions .",
    "these decouple at relatively small radius and end up with somewhat high temperatures , about 8 mev .",
    "the @xmath20 s decouple at a larger radius because of the additional charged current interactions with the protons , and consequently have a somewhat lower temperature , about 5 mev .",
    "finally , since they undergo charged current interactions with more abundant neutrons , @xmath21 s decouple at the largest radius and end up with the lowest temperature , about 3.5 to 4 mev .",
    "an msw resonance between the neutrinosphere and the stalled shock can then transform @xmath22 , cooling @xmath1 s , but heating @xmath21 s .",
    "since the interaction cross section of electron neutrinos with the matter in the stalled shock increases with increasing energy , it may be possible to regenerate the shock .",
    "fuller _ et al . _ found that for small mixing angles between @xmath1 and @xmath21 one can get a 60% increase in the explosion energy @xcite .",
    "there is another implication of the @xmath1 and @xmath21 mixing in the supernovae .",
    "supernovae are possible r - process sites @xcite , which requires a neutron - rich environment , i.e. , the ratio of electrons to baryons , @xmath23 , should be less than one half .",
    "@xmath23 in the nucleosynthesis region is given approximately by @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , etc .",
    "are the capture rates . hence if @xmath26 , then the medium is neutron - rich . as we discussed above , without matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the neutrino temperatures satisfy the inequality @xmath27 .",
    "but the msw effect , by heating @xmath21 and cooling @xmath1 can reverse the direction of inequality , making the medium proton - rich instead .",
    "hence the existence of neutrino mass and mixings puts severe constraints on heavy - element nucleosynthesis in supernova .",
    "these constraints are investigated in ref .",
    "if a completely polarized particle beam travels through a random magnetic field for a long enough time , it will be completely depolarized . in a similar way ,",
    "if different neutrino flavors mix , a completely `` polarized '' neutrino beam ( say all @xmath21 ) may become completely `` depolarized '' ( half @xmath21 , half @xmath28 ) after passing through a medium with fluctuating matter density @xcite .",
    "note that this can happen without a neutrino magnetic moment , it is simply a new aspect of the msw mechanism .",
    "there is an extensive discussion of neutrino oscillations in inhomogeneous media in the literature @xcite .",
    "we take the total electron density to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fluctuating part .",
    "one can assume that the average fluctuation vanishes    @xmath31    but the two - body correlations are non - zero :    @xmath32    where the correlation function @xmath33 has a finite correlation length .",
    "the effect is significant if the correlation length , @xmath34 , is small @xcite .",
    "in the white noise limit ,    @xmath35    a number of simplifications make numerical calculations particularly easy .",
    "the effects of possible solar density fluctuations are presented in figure 2 . in this figure",
    "the electron neutrino survival probability is plotted for two values of the mixing angle , chosen to provide non - adiabatic solutions for 2% ( left column ) and 4% density fluctuations ( right column ) .",
    "the density fluctuations are taken to be proportional to the local density predicted by the standard solar model @xcite .",
    "one observes that the effect of density fluctuations in the sun are small , but can conceivably give rise to annual variations in the solar neutrino flux",
    ".    the msw mechanism may also be relevant in collapsing pre - supernova stellar cores , where adiabatic conversion of electron neutrinos into massive ( e.g. @xmath1 ) neutrinos could result in readjustment of lepton numbers and small entropy generation @xcite .",
    "a consequent drop in the electron fraction , @xmath23 , could be significant for the mechanism of supernova explosion .",
    "the effect of density fluctuations in a collapsing star is plotted in figure 3 . in this figure",
    "the upper panel exhibits the neutrino survival probability as a function of the mass difference squared between the electron and heavy neutrino with ( solid line ) and without ( dashed line ) density fluctuations .",
    "the fractional density fluctuations are taken to be @xmath36 .",
    "one observes that there is a complete depolarization ( 50% conversion ) , especially for heavy neutrino mass ( assuming a very small electron neutrino mass ) greater than @xmath37 mev . in the lower panel",
    "the @xmath38 transition probability contours are plotted . here",
    "the lowest solid line indicates 10% , dashed lines 70% , and the dotted lines 80% conversion , with intermediate lines being in steps of 10% . for a detailed study of density fluctuations in supernova , both during the infall and at the hot - bubble after the bounce ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "neutrino astrophysics is a field with considerable prospects . in this review",
    "i only discuss low energy neutrino sources .",
    "there are many physics questions , such as the nature of the central engines of active galactic nuclei , which can be explored by doing high energy astrophysics @xcite .",
    "most of the time the information obtained from low- and high - energy neutrino astrophysics is complementary . for example , it is possible to look for high - energy neutrino signatures of cold dark matter .",
    "supernova neutrino observations and long - baseline neutrino experiments at somewhat lower energies probe hot dark matter .",
    "these experiments together may help us assess the role of the dark matter in the structure of the universe .",
    "i believe that in the years to come , neutrino astrophysics will answer many fundamental questions and will pose many new ones .",
