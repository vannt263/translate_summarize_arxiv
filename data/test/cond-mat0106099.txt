    "in the lowest landau level the fractional quantum hall effect is observed .",
    "however , it has not been observed in the landau levels with landau index @xmath1 larger than two .",
    "this is because the interaction between electrons is not short - ranged enough to make laughlin state realized . in such higher landau levels , koulakov et al .",
    "proposed realization of the stripe and bubble phases based on the hartree - fock theory [ 1,2 ] .",
    "these phases belong to families of the charge density wave states proposed before the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect in the lowest landau level [ 3,4 ] .",
    "so it is natural to anticipate such states once the fqh states are denied .",
    "the evidence of the stripe phase has been obtained from experiments on ultra high mobility samples at low temperature as remarkable anisotropy in the longitudinal resistance when the higher landau level is nearly half - filled [ 5,6 ] .",
    "although no direct evidence of the bubble phase has been obtained , the reentrant iqhe around @xmath2 and 3/4 [ 7 ] suggests the realization of the bubble phase , where @xmath3 $ ] is the filling factor of the topmost partially filled landau level .    since , the hartree - fock theory may fail to find the true ground state as evidenced in the lowest landau level , more reliable theory is desirable .",
    "so exact diagonalization studies have been done , and the realization of the stripe phase and the bubble phase in the ground state was confirmed [ 8 ] .",
    "however , the system size treated by the exact diagonalization is quite small , and the filling factor studied was limited . because of these limitations , such study can not determine the phase diagram of the present system . in the present study we investigated the ground state by dmrg method [ 9 ] .",
    "we have investigated systems with up to 18 electrons , and determined the ground state at various filling factors by examining the pair correlation function .",
    "part of the investigation , where we clarified the phase diagram in the third lowest landau level ( @xmath4 ) has already been published [ 10 ] . here",
    ", we give new results for the fourth lowest landau level together with the previous results .",
    "the hamiltonian for electrons in landau levels contains only the coulomb interactions . after the projection onto the @xmath1th landau level , the hamiltonian is written as @xmath5 ^2 v(q ) e^{i{\\bf q } \\cdot ( { \\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j ) } , \\label{coulomb}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the guiding center coordinate of the @xmath7th electron , which satisfy the commutation relation @xmath8 = { \\rm i}\\delta_{j , k}$ ]",
    "@xmath9 are the laguerre polynomials , and @xmath10 is the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the magnetic length @xmath11 is set to be 1 .",
    "we consider uniform positive background charge to cancel the component at @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) , and neglect the electrons in fully occupied lower landau levels .",
    "periodic boundary condition is imposed both in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions the period being @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the filling factor of the relevant landau level is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total number of electrons .",
    "we used the dmrg method to obtain the ground state of the system with up to 18 electrons at various fillings with changing the aspect ratio @xmath19 .",
    "we first investigated the aspect ration dependence of the ground state energy at fixed filling factors .",
    "then pair correlation function @xmath20 in guiding center coordinates , @xmath21 is calculated at local minima of the ground state energy . for the most filling factors our system is large enough that it is rather easy to tell the ground state cdw pattern by looking at @xmath22 .",
    "from the pair correlation function we found that the ground state at @xmath4 and 3 is either the wigner crystal , the bubble state , or the stripe state depending on the filling factor @xmath23 and the landau level index @xmath1 , except for a small region of the filling factor around 0.28 in @xmath24 landau level .",
    "the resultant phase diagram is shown in fig.1 and fig.2 . for @xmath4 landau level",
    "there are three phases .",
    "the boundary between the wigner crystal state and the two - electron bubble phase lies between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and that between the two - electron bubble and the stripe phase lies between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "inspection of the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath22 shows that these boundaries are the first order phase transition points . for @xmath24 landau level",
    "there are at least four phases . here",
    "three - electron bubble phase , where cluster of tree electrons form a kind of the wigner crystal , becomes possible .",
    "the ground state between @xmath30 and @xmath31 has not been identified .",
    "we will discuss this state later .",
    "we also solved the hamiltonian by the hartree - fock theory [ 4 ] . in this method the filling factor is also limited to simple rational fractions .",
    "however , for the bubble phase the order parameters obtained by the this method almost coincide with those proposed by fogler and koulakov [ 2 ] , just the same as the case of the wigner crystal state [ 4 ]",
    ". then it is possible to obtain the hartree - fock ground state as a continuous function of the filling factor , and transition point between different bubble states can be determined .",
    "the stripe phase has weak modulation along the stripes , which opens the gap at the fermi level and lowers the energy .",
    "the phase diagram by this method is also shown in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the phases are separated by the first order phase transition similarly to the dmrg case .",
    "the phase diagrams from these two methods are similar except that the correct phase diagram by the dmrg shows wider region for the stripe phase .",
    "the three - electron bubble phase at @xmath4 and the four electron bubble phase at @xmath24 are swallowed by the stripe phase .",
    "in this paper we have determined the phase diagram of electrons in the third and fourth lowest landau levels by the dmrg method .",
    "the slight difference in the phase diagrams for @xmath4 and @xmath32 comes from the range of the coulomb interaction projected to each landau level , namely the laguerre polynomial in eq.([coulomb ] ) is responsible for the difference . in actual systems",
    "there are several factors which affect the form of the coulomb potential .",
    "the first is the spread of the wave function in the direction perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane .",
    "this spread acts mostly to reduce the short - range part of the coulomb interaction .",
    "since this part is already reduced by the laguerre factor in the higher landau levels , we do not expect this will cause qualitative change to our phase diagram .",
    "another factor is the screening by the electrons in the filled lower landau levels .",
    "this acts to reduce the long - range part of the interaction .",
    "we did not considered this factor , since this effect is sample dependent .",
    "namely , it depends on the electron density as well as the filling factor . comparing our hartree - fock results with those by shklovskii s group , where the screening effect is considered [ 1,2 ] ,",
    "we have concluded that the screening effect does not affect the qualitative feature of the phase diagram .",
    "we think that the reentrant iqh state is the two - electron bubble phase , which is pinned by impurities .",
    "then our calculation predicts that the reentrant phase should be observed in @xmath24 landau level at lower filling factor .",
    "our calculation until now have not identified the ground state between @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath24 landau level .",
    "the @xmath22 looks like stripe phase with stronger modulation . actually the energy of stripe phase by the hartree - fock theory is quite close to those of the 2-electron and 3-electron bubble phases here .",
    "since the energy lowering by the quantum fluctuation is larger in stripe phase as the result around @xmath33 shows , reentrant stripe phase is a feasible candidate .",
    "we hope that we can identify this phase in near future .",
    "part of the numerical calculation is performed in the issp , university of tokyo .",
