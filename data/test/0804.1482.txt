    "the static casimir effect , theoretically predicted in 1948 @xcite , consists in the attraction of two perfectly conducting , parallel plates , due to the distortion of the electromagnetic vacuum state . as a consequence of quantum fluctuations under the very presence of external constraints , such a distortion of the vacuum state emerges from the fundamental concepts of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "casimir himself was the first to discuss the importance of spherical geometry in the distortion of the vacuum state @xcite , proposing in 1953 a semiclassical model for the stability of the electron . in this model ,",
    "the electron was assumed to be a perfectly conducting spherical shell carrying a total charge @xmath0 , with the coulomb repulsion balanced by an attractive casimir force .",
    "however , as elucidated by boyer @xcite in 1968 , the casimir force in spherical configuration is repulsive , invalidating the attempt to explain the stability of the electron through the casimir force .",
    "nonetheless , the electron model proposed by casimir provides evidence that one can not predict whether the casimir force will be attractive or repulsive before the whole calculation is carried out .",
    "moreover , the development of the bag model of the hadrons in the early 1970s  describing hadrons as quarks and antiquarks confined inside of a spherical cavity  also stimulated the investigation of the casimir effect with spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "beyond static geometries , the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , arising from movable external constraints , probes even more deeply into the complexity of the vacuum structure .",
    "the dynamics of the geometry gives rise to a time - dependent casimir force along with a dissipative component @xcite .",
    "the mechanical energy dissipated by this ` vacuum viscosity ' * *  * * induces the most striking manifestation of the dce , i.e. , the mechanism of particle creation and annihilation .",
    "g. t. moore was the first to proceed to the quantization of the radiation field in a cavity with movable perfectly reflecting boundaries @xcite and , still in the 1970s , the creation of photons from the nonuniform motion of the boundaries was predicted @xcite .",
    "later , it was also noticed that a sudden change in the refractive index of the medium @xcite could also extract photons from the vacuum radiation field .    regarding the spherical geometry  the subject of the present work",
    " it was proposed by schwinger @xcite that the dce could provide a possible explanation for the sonoluminescence phenomenon , discovered in the 1930s @xcite . however , in spite of interesting results following schwinger s hypothesis @xcite , the theoretical description of sonoluminescence still remains controversial .",
    "we finally mention that the dce with spherical geometry bears some similarity to the problem of particle creation in the expanding universe , where the spatial portion of the metric is a hyperspherical surface with time - dependent radius @xcite .    in the present study we deal with the dce for a massless scalar field confined between two concentric spherical moving shells , and present a general expression",
    " for any law of radial motion of the shells  to compute the average number of particle creation .",
    "we note that the particular case of a unique spherical shell moving with a specific law of motion was studied in ref . @xcite .",
