    "all - sky hi surveys have found significant numbers of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) . although various scenarios have been invoked to explain the disparate properties of the ensemble of hvcs , one population in particular , the isolated compact hvcs , remains a possible candidate for the continuing rain of material accreting on to the milky way and other local group galaxies ( e.g.braun & burton 1999 ; blitz et al .",
    "1999 ; sembach et  al .",
    "2002 ) , as predicted by models of hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. klypin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the goal of the current market leader , the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) , is to map out the distribution of hi gas in the local universe , providing an accurate map of the hvc distribution at finer resolution and to better sensitivity levels than obtained previously .",
    "recently , kilborn et al . ( 2000 ) announced the detection of an isolated compact hi cloud , hipass j1712 - 64 , with a systemic velocity of @xmath5450kms@xmath6 . transforming to the reference frame of the local group , j1712 - 64 s velocity is @xmath5240kms@xmath6 ; which , assuming the cloud is extragalactic , places it at a distance of @xmath53mpc ( h@xmath7=75kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "kilborn et al ( 2000 ) provided further evidence for this conclusion using optical imaging of j1712 - 64 , with the goal of detecting a stellar component . to limits of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , no overdensity of stellar sources were detected in the vicinity of j1712 - 64 .",
    "however , at a distance of 3mpc , the brightest putative asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or red giant branch stars ( rgb ) typically found in nearby dwarf galaxies would be at @xmath10 magnitudes of @xmath52324 well below the limit of their optical data .",
    "any unresolved low surface brightness signature due to fainter stars would also be close to their limiting surface brightness for detection , making the null optical result somewhat ambiguous .    in an effort to acquire significantly deeper optical imaging we imaged the region around j1712 - 64  with the wide field imager ( wfi ) mosaic camera at the aat .",
    "this paper presents the new , deep images of j1712 - 64obtained from these observations .",
    "the observations were processed using a new data - pipeline at the anglo - australian observatory , a brief synopsis of which is given in section  [ datareduction ] .",
    "an analysis of the images is presented in section  [ imageanalysis ] , and we finish with a brief discussion and summary of the results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the data were obtained on the nights of the 17 - 19 august 2001 using the wide field imager , mounted at the prime focus of the anglo - australian telescope at coonabarabran ( see tinney 2001 ) .",
    "the 1/2 degree @xmath11 1/2 degree field of view of wfi on the aat make it an ideal instrument for searching for optical counterparts of hvcs . for the observations of hipass j1712 - 64",
    "the seeing was sub - arcsec , but high intermittent cirrus made accurate photometric calibration difficult , and the calibration of the colour - magnitude diagrams and various associated limits alluded to later in the paper are only accurate at the @xmath50.1 magnitude level .",
    "a total integration time of 2700s for both @xmath12 and @xmath13-bands was acquired , split as 9@xmath11300s exposures in each band .",
    "the field was centred at 17 12 35.7 , -64 38 12 ( j2000 ) , corresponding to the centre of the northern component of j1712 - 64  ( kilborn et a. 2001 ) .",
    "all the data were processed through a prototype aao / wfi pipeline based on the data pipeline developed for the isaac newton telescope wide field camera ( int wfc ) .",
    "the pipeline provides the standard tools for removing the instrumental signature of ccd images and additionally provides means for defringing the data ( if needed ) , object catalogue generation and the ability to provide astrometric and photometric calibration in an automated manner ( see irwin & lewis 2001 for more details ) .    as an example of the versatility of the pipeline ,",
    "the main end products in this case were a pair of stacked @xmath12 and @xmath13-band images , based on an accurate world coordinate system ( wcs ) to coordinate the stacking , and the generation of a deep , detected - object colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "a false colour image of the ccd encompassing j1712 - 64 , with the hi contours overlaid , is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] , using r , 0.5(g+r ) and g for the rgb colours .",
    "careful visual inspection of the whole mosaic image ( four times the area shown in figure  [ figure1 ] ) reveals no compelling evidence for any dwarf galaxy , resolved or otherwise , that could be associated with the hi envelope .",
    "morphological classification as part of the data - reduction pipeline is based on automatic analysis of a discreetly sampled intensity curve - of - growth of all images . in any pairwise combination of such measures ,",
    "stellar images lie on a well - defined ( and constant ) locus as a function of magnitude leaving only the spread ( sigma ) in the locus to be further derived .",
    "this greatly facilitates image classification based on the sigma - normalised distance from the locus . the size and `` sign '' of the deviation(s )",
    "are used to assign images to one of three morphological classes : stellar , non - stellar , and noise - like .    at galactic coordinates , @xmath14 ,",
    "the extinction in this direction is relatively low at e(b - v ) = 0.11 ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) , hence all the standard galactic populations should be readily visible , as well as large numbers of background galaxies and any possible nearby dwarf galaxy component . therefore , we can be more quantitative in our search by using the distribution of detected stellar images in @xmath12,@xmath13 to probe for any non - uniformity in image distribution .",
    "analysis of isopleth maps , however , revealed that all are consistent with noise and therefore there is no evidence of any resolved compact stellar population in j1712 - 64  as would be expected for a nearby dwarf galaxy .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ figure2 ] for the range @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    a colour - magnitude diagram for the entire mosaic region containing images classified as stellar in the @xmath13-band is shown in figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "the expected galactic components of the thin disk k / m stars are clearly visible as the red plume around @xmath17 , while the thick disk f / g stars make up the other obvious component at @xmath18 .",
    "the faint blue stellar population appearing at the bottom left of the plot is most likely due to misclassified blue compact galaxies at redshifts @xmath19 .",
    "this component is much stronger in the equivalent non - stellar diagram and in both has a fairly uniform distribution over the whole field making it unlikely to be related to the hvc .",
    "once again there is no compelling signature of any underlying dwarf galaxy component .",
    "this paper has presented new images of the extragalactic hi candidate hipass j1712 - 64 , obtained with the wfi on the aat .",
    "these are significantly deeper than previous images , reaching stellar magnitudes fainter than @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "our search for any resolved associated stellar component was negative . likewise , there is no evidence for any underlying unresolved diffuse components associated with the cloud .",
    "since the photon noise/ instrumental signature surface brightness limits for detection of unresolved structure are around @xmath22 and @xmath23 magnitudes arcsec@xmath24 respectively , we can place limits on any possible optical counterpart . in practice ,",
    "the visibly patchy galactic foreground nebulosity becomes important @xmath51 magnitude brighter than these limits ; fortunately though , this patchiness avoids the region where the hi contours are prominent .",
    "typical local group dwarf galaxies have scale sizes of order @xmath51 kpc which , at a distance of 3mpc , would be equivalent to an angular scale of @xmath51 arcmin",
    ". we would expect to see the optical counterpart of such objects , if they exist , over a few scale lengths ( cf .",
    "hi contours in figure  [ figure1 ] ) . considering a 1 arcminute region and our surface brightness limits",
    ", the null detection of any diffuse optical structure leads to an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath25 for this object , if it were at a distance of 3 mpc .",
    "this is comparable to the limit derived by kilborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from photographic plates of @xmath26 , illustrating that we have pushed @xmath27 magnitudes further down the luminosity function compared to this earlier , shallower study .",
    "this limit is already at the lower end of the range for local group galaxies , making it unlikely than an optical component exists .",
    "similarly , this lower limit pushes the inferred hi mass to light ratio to @xmath28 , at least two orders of magnitude encountered in local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "hence , if j1712 - 64  is a local group member , it represents a very different type of object to what is currently known .",
    "such conclusions make it tempting to support one obvious alternate scenario for j1712 - 64   that it is a galactic halo high - velocity cloud ; a recent search of poss plates for stellar content in a sample of 250 northern hvcs yielded no detections ( simon & blitz 2002 ) . while there are a few hvcs in the hipass catalog ( putman et  al .",
    "2002 ) with galactic standard of rest velocities comparable to that of j1712 - 64 , should j1712 - 64  be a halo hvc , it would likewise necessarily be an extreme one .",
    "it is of further interest to note that j1712 - 64 , the earlier discovered j1616@xmath2955 ( staveley - smith et  al 1998 ) , and two additional clouds discovered by hipass ( koribalski et  al .",
    "2002 ) , _ all _ lie superimposed upon the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) .",
    "an _ extremely _ deep survey of this region of the supergalactic plane , searching for any putative connection between the clouds , is currently underway at parkes ( koribalski , gibson , et  al ) .",
    "the observations were processed using a new pipeline data reduction facility at the aao .",
    "this facility is based on the reduction procedure developed for data obtained with the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope on la palma .",
    "users of wfi at the aat who are interested in pipeline processing their data should contact geraint lewis .",
    "m. irwin thanks the aao for their hospitality during a visit when much of this work was finalised .",
