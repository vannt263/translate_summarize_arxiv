    "the anisotropy of the crystal - liquid interface free energy ( @xmath6 ) reflects differences in the interface structure for different orientations , and may play an essential role in determining the morphology of growing crystals @xcite .",
    "anisotropy is needed for dendritic structures , and apparently a detailed knowledge on anisotropy is required to fully understand the growth morphology @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the anisotropy of the interface free energy can be deduced from the shape of liquid inclusions in a solid matrix ( though , one needs to be careful to relax all the stresses before converting the shape into anisotropy ) @xcite .",
    "anisotropy has also been evaluated on the basis of the assumption that the dendrite growth directions correspond to the maximum stiffness , and minimizing the deviation between the calculated minima of an appropriately parameterized interface stiffness function and the growth directions of dendrites found in thin coatings experimentally @xcite .",
    "other methods evaluate the interface free energy and its anisotropy from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite using empirical model potentials such as the embedded atom potential .",
    "whether experiment @xcite or atomistic simulation @xcite , the anisotropic interface free energy data are usually fitted by the cubic harmonic expansion series introduced by fehlner and vosko @xcite .",
    "often only a few low index orientations are considered ( typically @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath3 ) , and a second - order cubic harmonic expansion is employed @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for the anisotropy of the crystal - liquid interface in 3d emerge mostly from the early broken - bond models for the fcc , bcc , hcp , and dc structures @xcite ( utilizing former results for the crystal - vapor interfaces @xcite ) , from the classical density functional theory @xcite , and recently for the fcc and bcc structures from the phase - field crystal ( pfc ) approach @xcite ( a simple dynamical density functional theory @xcite ) .",
    "some analytical predictions based on the approximations of the pfc model are also available : a multi - scale analysis has been used by wu and karma @xcite to evaluate the anisotropy of the interfacial fee energy near the critical point .",
    "they have approximated the equation of motion of the pfc model by a set of coupled equations that describe the time evolution of the amplitudes of the dominant density waves . analyzing the stationary solution ,",
    "they have concluded that the anisotropy is independent of the reduced temperature , a finding that accords with the results of majaniemi and provatas @xcite , who have used the local volume averaging method to obtain amplitude equations for liquid  solid interfaces that are broad relative to the periodicity of the crystalline phase . in these studies ,",
    "the independence of the anisotropy from the reduced temperature follows from approximations , which lead to weakly fourth - order amplitude theories of the ginzburg - landau type , from which all material parameters can be scaled out @xcite . as a result",
    ", the anisotropy of the solid - liquid interface free energy depends only on the crystal structure .",
    "this independence of the anisotropy from the reduced temperature is , however , unphysical , as the anisotropy must vanish , when the correlation length ( the width of the solid - liquid interface ) diverges at the critical point , as indeed suggested by the equilibrium shapes of finite size clusters from 2d pfc simulations @xcite .",
    "it is , however , important to test the anisotropy of the solid - liquid interface free energy by equilibrium simulations for the flat interface in 3d , which is free from size effects , since the latter is known to influence the equilibrium shape considerably @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in this paper , we are going to demonstrate that the free energy of the flat bcc - liquid interface depends not only on the orientation but also on the reduced temperature .",
    "we map out the orientation dependence in detail at several reduced temperatures , then fit the results with an expression based on an eight - term kubic harmonic expansion @xcite to represent the orientation dependence in a closed form , and determine the respective wulff shapes , a mathematical construction @xcite to which the equilibrium shape , minimizing the interfacial contribution to the cluster free energy for a given volume , tends for large particle sizes .

    "we have mapped the orientation and temperature dependence of the bcc - liquid interface free energy @xmath6 in the pfc model . as in 2d , the dependence of @xmath6 on the reduced temperature is consistent with the respective mean field exponent .",
    "a kubic harmonic fit has been performed to represent the anisotropy .",
    "with increasing reduced temperature , the corresponding wulff shape changes from sphere ( at the critical point , @xmath8 ) to a polyhedral shape at large @xmath2 that differs considerably from rhombo - dodecahedral , observed in dynamic simulations based on the pfc equation of motion .",
