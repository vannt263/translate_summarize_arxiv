    "trihalomethane ( thm ) molecules are small molecules that are similar to methane ( ch@xmath1 ) but with three of the h atoms replaced by halogens ( f , cl , br , i , at ) .",
    "the most welknown thm is trichloromethane ( chcl@xmath0 ) , also known as chloroform .",
    "thms are of environmental concern as they are toxic to human health @xcite",
    ". the human body adsorbs thms by inhalation and by passage through the skin , but the main contribution to human exposure arises from the consumption of chlorinated drinking water @xcite .    of the thms , chloroform is found in the highest concentration in the environment .",
    "chlorine used for water disinfection reacts with organic material in the water , forming a number of thms as byproducts : mainly chloroform , but also thms with one or more br atoms .",
    "the thms toxity motivates a search for an effective process for selective extraction .",
    "carbon materials , such as activated carbon or carbon nanotubes are used or have been suggested for the use in adsorbing filters for removing thms from the drinking water after the disinfection , but before intake @xcite .",
    "we here study how a chloroform molecule adsorbs on the simplest of carbon materials , graphene . by use of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations we determine the energy gained at adsorption and compare with the adsorption energies of similar molecules , like methane and tribromomethane ( chbr@xmath0 ) ,",
    "also called bromoform . for these calculations",
    "we apply the first - principles van der waals ( vdw ) density - functional method vdw - df @xcite .",
    "chloroform on carbon materials has previously been studied in a few studies by use of theory .",
    "dft has been used for chloroform on benzene in a study employing the vdw - df method @xcite and for a study of chloroform on carbon nanotubes with use of the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite . for experiments ,",
    "there is a century long tradition of studies of chloroform because it was frequently used as a solvent and as an anasthetic .",
    "however , adsorption studies on carbon materials , provinding adsorption ( or desorption ) energies , are more recent @xcite .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section ii we describe the computational method and our system of chloroform and graphene . in section",
    "iii we present our results and discussions , and section iv contains our summary .",
    "thms are molecules with a central c atom and four other atoms surrounding the c atom approximately evenly distributed . of these",
    ", one atom is an h atom and the three other atoms are halogens . in this paper",
    "we analyze the adsorption on graphene of chloroform and bromoform , for which the three halogen atoms are cl or br atoms , respectively .",
    "we use dft with the vdw - df method @xcite to determine the adsorption energy and atomic structure .",
    "our calculations are carried out fully self - consistently @xcite .",
    "we use the dft code gpaw @xcite with vdw - df @xcite in a fast - fourier - transform implementation @xcite .",
    "the gpaw code is an all - electron dft code based on projector augmented waves @xcite ( paw ) .",
    "figure [ fig : chloroform ] illustrates the adsorbed chloroform molecule on graphene , and the periodically repeated orthorhombic unit cells used in our calculations .",
    "we show the adsorption configuration that has the h atom pointing away from graphene . a previous vdw - df study @xcite of chloroform with benzene discussed the c - h/@xmath2 interaction in a dimer with the h atom of chloroform pointing towards the center of the aromatic benzene ring . in order to connect to that study",
    "we also carry out calculations with the h atom pointing towards graphene and find that configuration to have a smaller ( less favorable ) adsorption energy than configurations with the h atom pointing away from graphene . in this work we therefore focus on adsorption configurations with cl ( or br ) atoms closest to graphene as shown in figure [ fig : chloroform ] .",
    "we define the adsorption energy @xmath3 as the difference in total energy when the molecule is adsorbed on graphene ( @xmath4 ) and when it is in the gas phase far away from graphene ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 here we follow the sign convention that yields positive values of @xmath3 for systems that bind .",
    "the two total - energy terms in ( [ eq : ea ] ) are both calculated with the adsorbant and graphene within one unit cell , the unit cell having the same size in both calculations . because that approximation is less sensitive to changes in grid positions @xcite . however , with the fine real - space grid used here and the rather small adsorbant molecules the total energy difference between the deformed and the gas phase structure of chloroform or bromoform is less than 1 mev .",
    "we therefore here solely use vdw - df in the calculations . ] because @xmath5 is calculated with the same adsorbant - adsorbant separation as @xmath4 the direct lateral interaction is subtracted from our results @xcite .",
    "the optimal positions of the atoms within chloroform ( and bromoform ) are determined by minimization of the hellmann - feynman forces acting on the chloroform ( or bromoform ) atoms , when adsorbed on to graphene (  \" ) and when away from graphene (  \") .",
    "we use the molecular - dynamics optimization method  fast inertial relaxation engine \" ( fire ) @xcite with the requirement that the size of the remaining force on each atom is less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the positions of the graphene atoms are left unchanged .",
    "the hellmann - feynman forces are derived from gradients in the electron density @xmath7 .",
    "the optimization yields the bond lengths and angles in the molecules ( after adsorption and in the gas phase ) and the optimal position of the molecule with respect to graphene .",
    "the potential well for the molecule near graphene is very shallow .",
    "we therefore start the optimization process in several different lateral and vertical positions of chloroform .",
    "we use an orthorhombic unit cell of size @xmath8  for most of our calculations , but we also test the adsorption energy convergence with unit cell size , using a unit cell of size @xmath9  . here",
    "@xmath10 , and @xmath11  is the clean graphene lattice constant as found earlier by relaxing the lateral size of the unit cell @xcite . in the direction perpendicular to graphene",
    "there is @xmath12  of vacuum above chloroform when desorbed ( and @xmath13  when adsorbed ) to avoid vertical interaction across unit cell boundaries .",
    "the ( valence ) electron density and wave functions are represented on evenly distributed grids in space . to ensure a good accuracy in our calculations we choose the density grid to have approximately 0.12  grid point separation in all three directions @xcite . in all calculations we use a @xmath142@xmath151 monkhorst - pack @xmath16-point sampling of the brillouin zone .     unit cell ( top panel ) and the @xmath17 unit cell ( middle and bottom panels ) .",

    "dft is in principle exact , but in practise the exchange - correlation part @xmath19 of the total energy must be approximated .",

    "the @xmath21 is chosen as the exchange part of a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . in the original version of vdw - df @xcite ( which we use here )",
    "the exchange chosen is that of the revpbe approximation @xcite .",
    "the correlation energy @xmath22 is split @xcite into a nearly - local part @xmath23 and a part that includes the most nonlocal interactions @xmath24 , @xmath25 = e_c^0[n]+e_c^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize nl}}}[n ] \\,.\\ ] ] in a homogeneous system the term @xmath26 is the correlation @xmath27 obtained from the local density approximation ( lda ) , and in general @xcite we approximate @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",

    "it is given by a kernel @xmath29 which is explicitly stated in ref .  .",
    "the term @xmath24 is sensitive to changes in the local real space grid , for example when the nuclei positions are translated by a distance not corresponding to an integer number of real - space grid points @xcite . for calculations involving small ( few mev ) energy differences , like the calculations for the potential energy surface introduced in section [ sec : iii.d ] we therefore keep positional changes of the rigid molecules to an integer number of grid points .",
    "finally , we make sure that each of the total - energy calculations are accurately converged to a change in the total energy of less than 0.1 mev per unit cell , or less than approximately 10@xmath30 ev per atom in the unit cell , in the last three dft iterations .",
    "this choice of allowed change is significantly smaller than the default of gpaw and is essential in order to discuss energy changes in this adsorption system where relevant differences in total energies are down to the mev scale .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      in figure [ fig : pes ] we show the potential energy surface ( pes ) for chloroform .",
    "the figure is obtained from translating chloroform along graphene with the chloroform c atom kept at a fixed distance @xmath31  from the graphene plane . in figure",
    "[ fig : pes ] origo corresponds to the position shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : chloroform ] .",
    "we find that the variation in adsorption energy along graphene is small , with an energy difference of less than 6 mev when @xmath31  .",
    "this illustrates that the corrugation of graphene , as experienced by the adsorbed chloroform molecules , is very small , and it takes only very little kinetic energy to overcome the barriers for lateral motion on graphene .",
    "therefore , the concept of  adsorption sites \" is not relevant in these physisorption studies @xcite . in effect , the chloroform is free to move along graphene at all temperatures relevant in practical applications mentioned in the introduction .    from figure",
    "[ fig : pes ] we also find that the position used for the calculated adsorption energy in table [ tab : energies ] is close to but not quite the optimal position , albeit not the energetically worst position either . in any case",
    ", the effect of our choice of position is a few mev , or less than 1% of the adsorption energy .    in all calculations for the pes the relative positions of the atoms within the adsorbants",
    "are kept the same , thus no further relaxation of the molecular structure is allowed . however , since the change in molecular structure when desorbing is on the sub - mev level , and less than the accuracy of our calculations , we expect the differences in molecular structure in the various adsorption positions to be even smaller and the effect on the adsorption energy to thus be negligible .",
    "all data points for the pes are from adsorbant positions translated an integer number of grid points along the surface , that is , on a uniform orthogonal grid with 0.12  between grid lines .",
    "we restrict the possible positions of chloroform in order to keep the atomic positions relative to the density grid the same in all calculations , thus avoiding any effects of the sensitivity of the vdw - df results on the positioning on the grid .",
    "this is potentially important because the pes is mapping a very shallow energy landscape .",
    "the data for the pes are calculated for all grid positions within a @xmath32 part of the @xmath33 unit cell , that is , by scanning over twice the area of the graphene primitive cell ( which has only two c atoms ) .",
    "therefore , when translating the chloroform molecule over the @xmath32 area we calculate two data points for each unique adsorption position . to lower the sub - mev noise we use the average of the total energies in the two equivalent positions for the plot in figure [ fig : pes ] .",
    "for clarity we also include in figure [ fig : pes ] repetitions of the calculations in the two lateral directions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pes ] only results of the fixed distance @xmath31  are shown , but our calculations include also distances @xmath34  in the same lateral positions as used in figure [ fig : pes ] .",
    "this corresponds to moving the molecule one full grid spacing closer to or further away from graphene and redoing the pas calculations .",
    "however , all adsorption energies at those distances are smaller than any of the adsorption energies at the @xmath31  distance , and it is clear that the optimal distance @xmath35 from graphene varies much less than 0.12  when moving along graphene .",
    "although the vertical part of the adsorption potential is shallow compared to covalent and ionic binding the lateral part is even more shallow .",
    "the differences in smallest and largest total energy within each of the three chloroform - c - to - graphene distances are 7.7 mev , 4.8 mev , and 2.9 mev for the distances @xmath36  , 4.20  , and 4.32  , respectively .",
    "thus the corrugation of graphene , as seen by chloroform , becomes slightly more pronounced in positions closer to graphene , even though the corrugation is small at all three distances considered here .",
    "even water from untreated drinking water wells contains thms @xcite .",
    "the thms are spread in the environment since chlorinated water is used for watering , and it leaks from swimming pools and enters waste water .",
    "it is also produced by salt used on winter roads .",
    "chloroform is also relatively volatile and escapes from water into the air with vapor ( where inhalation may pose a health problem ) or enters through the skin , for example during showers or in swimming pools .",
    "absorption through the gastrointestinal tracts is fast and extensive , with the majority of ingested chloroform recovered in expired air within a few hours @xcite . with chloroform found in 11.4% of public wells in the u.s .",
    "@xcite and chlorination still an important candidate for improving the quality of drinking water in developing countries , the occurrence of thms is a potential human health concern , and methods to remove thms after chlorination and before use of the water should be improved .",
    "chlorination of water gives rise to a number of thms as byproducts , mainly cl- and br - based thms . in order for these to be removed from water by adsorption on to graphene",
    "it is necessary that the adsorption energy at least exceeds that of water on graphene , and that the adsorption energy is much higher than the barrier for thermal desorption at relevant temperatures , here around 300 k which corresponds to @xmath3726 mev . in a ccsd(t ) study @xcite the adsorption energy of water on graphene was found to be 135 mev , and in a recent vdw - df study @xcite ( utilizing a different exchange functional than here , the optb86b exchange @xcite ) the water adsorption energy was found to be 140 mev .",
    "both results are clearly smaller than our chloroform and bromoform adsorption energies that are in the range 350410 mev .",
    "thus , while not directly giving proof that graphene can be used for water filters after chlorination our results do suggest that this may be possible .",
    "we present a study of the adsorption on graphene of the two thms chloroform and bromoform using the van der waals density functional method vdw - df . we find that chloroform and bromoform physisorb with their h atom pointing away from graphene , yielding adsorption energies 357 mev ( 34.4 kj / mol ) for chloroform and 404 mev ( 39.0 kj / mol ) for bromoform .",
    "this suggests that these thms bind sufficiently strongly to graphene for graphene to be used in filtering of chlorinated water to remove the thm byproducts .",
