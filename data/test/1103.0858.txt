    "the microwave electrodynamic response in high-@xmath4 superconductors ( htcs ) is a precious tool in the investigation of these materials .",
    "it provides a great deal of information concerning fundamental physics @xcite , as well as allowing to address essential issues in view of technological applications @xcite .",
    "the microwave response determined at zero field has allowed to address many points such as the temperature dependence of the superfluid density @xcite , and the quasi - particles ( qp ) properties above and below the superconducting transition @xcite . by applying a static magnetic field @xmath7 , htcs are driven in the mixed state where the presence of vortices allows for the disclosure of additional physics @xcite .",
    "vortices , which are set in motion by the lorentz force exerted by microwave currents , dissipate energy through the qp excitations located in and around their cores , in which the order parameter is depressed . because of the nature of their cores , vortices can be considered as a window of `` quasi - normal '' state properties accessible below @xmath4 , embedded in the superconducting condensate , and thus useful to probe `` normal''-state - related properties , simultaneously with the superconducting gap issues ( in particular , its symmetry ) .    from the point of view of fundamental physics ,",
    "it is then interesting to investigate the vortex dissipation , dictated by the quasi - particle density of states ( dos ) and relaxation time in the vortex cores .    at the same time , from a technological point of view , it is well known @xcite that the power handling of htcs , relevant to microwave devices , is limited by grain - boundaries contribution ( dominant at low fields ) as well as by vortex motion , the latter being the ultimate , unavoidable limitation . within this scenario ,",
    "the investigation of vortex pinning mechanisms is an essential task .",
    "single crystals are ideal systems for the study of intrinsic properties , while epitaxial films are of interest for applications . on the other hand , monodomains , despite their technological interest , are rarely the subject of microwave studies .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will present the microwave characterization and study of dyba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath2 ( dybco ) monodomains",
    ". a very few studies of dybco at microwaves in the mixed state exist @xcite , while the parent compound yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath2 ( ybco ) is widely studied .",
    "it will demonstrate particularly useful a comparison between data taken in dybco monodomains , in ybco single crystals @xcite and in ybco epitaxial thin films with artificially enhanced pinning @xcite , as prototypical case for intrinsic and extrinsic behaviour , respectively .",
    "the main experimental quantity in microwave experiments is the effective surface impedance @xmath10 . in this work",
    ", the surface impedance is measured by means of two cylindrical resonators , a silver - coated metal cavity @xcite and a dielectric resonator @xcite , operating in the te@xmath11 mode at approximately 48.3 ghz and 47.7 ghz , respectively .",
    "the surface perturbation method is used , with the sample under measurement replacing one of the cavity bases .",
    "the microwave currents flow parallel to the sample surface ( along the @xmath12 planes for the @xmath13-axis oriented samples ) on circular patterns .",
    "a solid / liquid nitrogen cryostat allows to reach temperatures @xmath14 as low as 60 k , with temperature control within @xmath150.005 k. a conventional electromagnet generates magnetic fields @xmath16 t , applied perpendicularly to the probed surface of the sample ( i.e. parallel to the superconductor @xmath13-axis in @xmath13-axis oriented samples ) .",
    "the field - dependent cavity quality factor @xmath17 and resonant frequency @xmath18 are measured to yield the corresponding surface impedance variations according to the following equations : @xmath19\\\\ \\delta x_{\\rm s } ( h , t)&=&x_{\\rm s } ( h , t)-x_{\\rm s } ( 0,t)=\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -2g\\frac{\\nu(h , t)-\\nu(0,t)}{\\nu(0,t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is a geometric factor of the cavity which can be computed from the theoretically known distribution of the electromagnetic field . here ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 , for the cavity and the dielectric resonator , respectively .",
    "samples smaller than the base of the resonators are accommodated with the aid of an auxiliary thin metallic mask . in this case",
    "the geometric factor increases and sensitivity decreases .",
    "measurements are performed by quasi - statically sweeping the applied field intensity @xmath23 at fixed temperature after zero field cooling .",
    "it is worth noting that by considering field - induced variations of @xmath24 , no calibration of the cavity response is needed since the latter is field independent .",
    "+ as already anticipated in the previous section , the in - field surface impedance is determined by two main contributions : grain boundaries and vortex motion .",
    "+ grain boundaries , depending on the misalignment angle between adjacent grains , exhibit behaviours ranging from metallic to josephson tunneling . in magnetic fields ,",
    "they constitute preferential paths for the motion of vortices , yielding generally lower pinning forces along their direction : the actual nature of the vortices located in the gb depends again on the misalignment angle .",
    "with larger and larger misalignment angle , the nature of vortices changes from standard abrikosov vortices to the so - called abrikosov - josephson ( aj ) vortices , and finally to core - less josephson vortices @xcite .",
    "many models have been developed in order to capture the gb behaviour in the microwave regimes @xcite .",
    "independently from the adopted model , the main signature of gb in the in - field microwave surface impedance consists in an abrupt , quasi - step - like increase of the surface resistance @xmath25 with increasing field , followed by a flat plateau @xcite .",
    "the field scale over which the step actually extends varies from a few mt @xcite for weak - links and josephson vortices up to 0.1 t or larger for aj vortices @xcite .",
    "+ abrikosov vortex motion within intragrain regions is the ubiquitous phenomenon visible in surface impedance measurements in the mixed state . the mixed state microwave response , which includes vortex dynamics , is quite intricate , since it emerges from the interplay between the currents excited by the applied microwave fields and vortices set in motion by these currents .",
    "many authors considered this issue , providing models which take into accounts various aspects @xcite . following coffey - clem ( cc ) approach @xcite ,",
    "the whole complex resistivity @xmath26 can be written down as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the microwave angular frequency , @xmath29 is the complex resistivity due to abrikosov vortex motion , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the london and normal fluid penetration depths , respectively .",
    "+ vortex dynamics involves many mechanisms : the interaction with the superconducting condensate yields a viscous drag , described through a viscous drag coefficient ( also commonly called vortex viscosity ) @xmath32 .",
    "the interaction between crystal defects and the fluxon system generates a pinning effect usually described through the pinning constant @xmath33 , applicable in the limit of small vortex displacements from their equilibrium positions as determined by high frequency stimuli .",
    "thermal fluctuations allow for thermally activated flux jumps between pinning sites , yielding the so - called creep .",
    "+ one finds @xcite that a large variety of different models can be formulated under the following very general expression for the vortex resistivity @xmath29 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the flux flow resistivity , @xmath36 the magnetic induction field , @xmath37 the flux quantum , @xmath38 a dimensionless creep factor , constrained in the range [ 0,1 ] .",
    "when creep can be neglected ( @xmath39 ) , the above expression reverts to the well - known gittleman - rosemblum model @xcite .",
    "+ the relation ( in the local limit ) between the superconductor complex resistivity @xmath26 and the measured surface impedance depends on the penetration depth of the e.m .",
    "field with respect to the superconducting sample thickness @xmath40 : for bulk samples , i.e. @xmath41 , one has : @xmath42 whereas in thin films , for which the @xmath43 condition holds,@xcite : @xmath44",
    "dybco single domains were prepared with precursor powders dyba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath45 and dy@xmath8bacuo@xmath46 , produced by solid - state synthesis from dy@xmath8o@xmath9 , baco@xmath9 and cuo powders .",
    "the powder mixture was pressed uni - axially to give cylindrical pellets of 10.8 mm diameter , which were melt - textured in atmospheric air conditions using a nd-123 single - crystal seed .",
    "large `` quasi - single - crystals '' , mainly @xmath13-axis oriented , have been obtained , with @xmath47 88 - 89 k. two distinct pellets , ( a ) and ( b ) , having similar @xmath48 88 k , will be considered in the following .    from the first pellet ( a ) , two samples of about the same thickness @xmath49 mm were cut : one ( a2 ) , approximately 2@xmath502 mm@xmath51 square , has been characterized by a magneto - optic ( mo ) study .",
    "magneto - optic images are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : mo ] ( bright regions denote higher field intensity , black regions denote zero field ) : a static magnetic field is applied , perpendicularly to the sample surface , after a zfc of the sample down to 73.5 k. in panel ( a ) the field is set to 15 @xmath52 t : the sample is not threaded by magnetic flux , thus exhibiting a single domain behaviour . at higher field values ( 90 @xmath52 t , panel ( b ) ) , the magnetic flux penetrates in the sample : a few cracks , along which flux lines preferentially enter the sample are visible . going back to zero field ( panel ( c ) ) , remnant flux ( indicative of significant pinning ) is visible with slight dishomogeneities , apart from the cracks , along which flux lines easily exit from the sample volume . through the mo analysis the sample shows an overall single domain behaviour , with no visible microscale flux penetration .",
    "+ the parent sample ( a1 ) is a @xmath5310.2 mm side square and is used for the microwave measurements @xcite performed by means of the cavity operating at 48.3 ghz .",
    "measurements of @xmath54 and @xmath55 at selected temperatures are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : zsdy01 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the surface resistance increases with the field , with steeper increase at larger @xmath14 . at low fields",
    "there is no evidence for step - like increase of the dissipation : we deduce that no significant contribution to the losses comes from weak - links or josephson fluxons .",
    "the absence of signatures of jj or aj vortices confirms the mo : the sample does not present significant grain boundaries , thus behaving as a single domain also at microwaves .    on the other hand ,",
    "the surface reactance is featureless and essentially flat , remaining within the same error range ( @xmath15 0.01 @xmath56 , denoted by the thick horizontal lines ) for the temperature range here presented . despite large scattering than in @xmath25 data , due to the sensitivity limits of the cavity used for the measurements , @xmath55 clearly remains well below @xmath57 and constant with @xmath23 : this is a clear indication of irrelevance of pinning at our measuring frequency .",
    "in fact , one can see that the primary effect of pinning is an increase of the reactance ( connected to the elastic forces recalling vortices to the pinning centers ) .",
    "analytically , it can be seen by inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhovm ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zbulk ] ) , and taking limits for small fields and large pinning , that @xmath58 .",
    "since we find that @xmath55 is negligible with respect to @xmath59 , we can safely neglect pinning in the analysis of our data .",
    "it is worth stressing that undetectable pinning in the high frequency regime does not necessarily imply small pinning in the d.c .",
    "transport regime : high frequencies force flux lines to undergo to very small oscillations ( small displacement regime ) , thus probing mainly the steepness of the pinning wells .",
    "by contrast , low frequencies and dc force flux lines to large displacements , thus probing mainly the pinning barrier heights . indeed",
    ", similar dybco samples were found to present significant pinning through d.c .",
    "and magnetic characterizations @xcite .",
    "the same presence of remnant magnetization , as seen with mo , points to a significant pinning in the quasistatic regime .    by neglecting pinning effects",
    "( therefore neglecting also creep ) , and by considering that , not too close to @xmath4 , the london penetration depth is much shorter than the normal fluid penetration depth , eq .",
    "[ eq : rhoc ] reverts to @xmath60 with @xmath61 , which allows to compute the surface resistance in the bulk limit as : @xmath62 the theoretical expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsbulk ] ) predicts a crossover from the linear behaviour at low fields , @xmath63 when the material has a ( real ) flux flow resistivity @xmath64 and screening is dictated by superfluid over the london penetration depth @xmath30 , to a square - root dependence at higher fields .",
    "the crossover is ruled by a threshold field value proportional to @xmath65 . in the general case ,",
    "( [ eq : rsbulk ] ) yields a downward curvature on @xmath59 , which allows to fit well the experimental data . within the london limit @xmath66 , and fits of the experimental curves",

    "surface resistance data for selected temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsdy02 ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath54 increases at a quicker rate than in sample a1 : given their similar @xmath4 , this implies that sample b1 is more dissipative .",
    "moreover , an initial step is visible at moderately low fields ( up to @xmath67 t ) , after which @xmath57 increases linearly with the field , in contrast with the downward curvature seen on sample a1 .",
    "the initial step is , as already anticipated , typical of grain boundaries , and the linear increase of @xmath57 is due to standard abrikosov vortex dynamics . a prototypical measure of this kind of behaviour is shown by data taken on granular samples , like the data for @xmath57 at 23 ghz of a gdba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 granular sample @xcite reported in the inset of fig .",

    "[ fig : rsdy02 ] , panel ( b ) .",
    "however , in sample b1 @xmath69 , whereas in sample a1 @xmath57 has a downward curvature .",
    "this fact implies that ( a ) @xmath30 in sample b1 is larger than in a1 , indicating a larger penetration of the microwave field and that ( b ) @xmath32 is smaller .",
    "an estimate of @xmath30 and @xmath32 can be given as follows .",

    "( [ eq : rsbulk ] ) coincides with the data .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "a larger @xmath30 implies a larger disomogeneity in the sample , coherent with the stronger signature of gb observed ; the simultaneous reduction of @xmath32 will be discussed below .      in the previous subsection we have presented microwave measurements on dybco single domain samples , detecting no pinning ( at least , no significant pinning visible in this high frequency dynamic regime ) , which allowed us to extract the vortex viscosity , a physical quantity connected with intrinsic properties of the material . in this subsection",
    "we briefly present data taken on ybco epitaxial thin films , where nanosize bazro@xmath1 ( bzo ) particles were intentionally added in order to artificially improve the pinning properties .",
    "these systems qualify themselves as strongly `` extrinsic '' with respect to the dybco monodomain .",
    "the ybco / bzo thin ( thickness @xmath72 120 nm , @xmath4= 90 k ) film here considered was grown by pulsed laser ablation from a target with 7 mol.% bzo content .",
    "bzo particles are typically extended ( correlated ) defects , of transverse size of a few nm @xcite .",

    "is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : ybcobzo ] .",
    "it is worth to stress that a large surface reactance is observed , pointing to a very strong pinning in this sample : for the measurement shown , @xmath73 .",

    "given the thickness of the film , eq .",
    "[ eq : zfilm ] holds ; since @xmath74 , @xmath75 and creep can be safely considered negligible , so that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhoc ] ) and ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) yield @xmath76 .",
    "finally , by considering only the field - induced variations and neglecting any pair - breaking effects on @xmath30 since @xmath77 , one has in the london limit @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath79 can be directly derived from @xmath54 and @xmath55 , without the need of any fitting procedure .",

    "we now comment and draw some conclusions about the vortex viscosities as extracted through mixed state microwave measurements performed on various materials and samples . in fig . [",
    "fig : alleta ] , viscosities of various 123 systems are shown : namely , the dybco monodomain measured at 48.3 ghz , the ybco / bzo thin film measured at 47.7 ghz , and a ybco single crystal measured at 40.8 ghz ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : alleta ] , it can be seen that all the considered samples exhibit viscosities with similar absolute values and temperature dependencies . since @xmath32 is determined by the quasi - particles scattering times and density of states in the vortex cores ( together with a contribution arising from the regions around the vortices , given the d - wave nature of htcs @xcite ) , this fact allows to infer that all these 123 systems , despite their structural and `` extrinsic '' differences , share the same fundamental physics of quasiparticles in the mixed state .",
    "this is contrasted by the measurements taken in dybco sample b1 , where we estimate a vortex viscosity smaller by a factor @xmath80 ( continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : alleta ] ) .",
    "the latter observation deserves a specific comment .",
    "in fact , an explanation can be given as follows : since @xmath81 ( being @xmath82 and @xmath83 the quasi - particles concentration and scattering time , respectively ) @xcite , it comes out that sample b1 is affected by a significant disorder on the nanoscale ( appreciable on scales of the order of the vortex size ) .",
    "the simultaneous appearance of disorder on microscale , as indicated by the appearance of weak - links fingerprints ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rsdy02 ] and the discussion of the weak - links induced microwave losses in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is an intriguing coincidence that will be further studied in future experiments .",
    "we have presented and compared mixed state microwave measurements performed on various hts re - bco system , including dybco monodomains and ybco epitaxial thin films with artificially introduced nanoparticles .",
    "we have shown that the microwave techniques gicves important information , complementary to dc investigation .",
    "in particular , it is possible to obtain the intrinsic vortex viscosity even in very strongly pinned materials .",
    "we have extensively characterized dybco monodomains , and we have found that they can exhibit the same microwave viscosity than ybco crystals and thin films with artificially included nanoparticles , thus indicating the same quasiparticle physics .",
    "we have also shown that dybco monodomains in some case can exhibit simultaneous microscale inhomogeneity , leading to weak - links , and possible nanoscale inhomogeneity , leading to a small scattering time as revealed by smaller viscosity .",
