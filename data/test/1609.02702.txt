    "discrete differential geometry studies discrete equivalents of the geometric notions and methods of classical differential geometry , such as notions of curvature and integrability for polyhedral surfaces . in this connection ,",
    "discrete surfaces have been studied one after another with strong ties to mathematics physics and great potential for computer analysis , architecture , numerics .",
    "progress in this field is to a large extent stimulated by its relevance for computer graphics and mathematical physics@xcite .",
    "recently , the expansion of computer graphics and applications in mathematical physics have given a great impulse to the issue of giving discrete equivalents of affine differential geometric objects@xcite . in @xcite a consistent definition of discrete affine spheres",
    "is proposed , both for definite and indefinite metrics , and in @xcite a similar construction is done in the context of improper affine spheres .",
    "following the ideas of klein , presented in his famous lecture at erlangen , several geometers in the early 20th century proposed the study of curves and surfaces with respect to different transformation groups . in geometry , an affine transformation , affine map or an affinity is a function between affine spaces which preserves points , straight lines and planes .",
    "also , sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation",
    ". an affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points , though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line .",
    "examples of affine transformations include translation , scaling , homothety , similarity transformation , reflection , rotation , shear mapping , and compositions of them in any combination and sequence .",
    "a centroaffine transformation is nothing but a general linear transformation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 . in 1907",
    "tzitz@xmath3ica found that for a surface in euclidean 3-space the property that the ratio of the gauss curvature to the fourth power of the distance of the tangent plane from the origin is constant is invariant under a centroaffine transformation .",
    "the surfaces with this property turn out to be what are now called tzitz@xmath3ica surfaces , or proper affine spheres with center at the origin . in centroaffine differential geometry",
    ", the theory of hypersurfaces has a long history .",
    "the notion of centroaffine minimal hypersurfaces was introduced by wang @xcite as extremals for the area integral of the centroaffine metric .",
    "see also @xcite for the classification results about centroaffine translation surfaces and centroaffine ruled surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "smooth geometric objects and their transformations should belong to the same geometry .",
    "in particular discretizations should be invariant with respect to the same transformation group as the smooth objects are(projective , affine , mbius etc ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with some invariant properties of the discrete centroaffine indefinite surface , which is organized as follows : basic concepts of classical centroaffine differential geometry are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we define the discrete centroaffine indefinite surface , and then obtain the structure equations , compatibility conditions and some centroaffine invariants . in section 4 , the laplacian operator is defined as the gradient of the dirichlet energy for a discrete centroaffine indefinite surface . the discrete centroaffine indefinite surface with constant coefficients is considered in section 5 .",
    "section 6 deals with the convexity of a discrete centroaffine indefinite surface .",
    "prior to the introduction of a discrete centroaffine indifinite surfaces theory , in this section , we recall some fundamental notions for centroaffine hypersurfaces in @xmath4 . for details",
