    "coherent diffraction imaging of single molecules at atomic resolution @xcite is a major goal for the present and forthcoming x - ray free electron lasers ( lcls , sacla , european xfel ) @xcite .",
    "the high intensity and the extremely short pulse length ( @xmath0100fs ) of the xfel beam are needed to get a sufficiently strong scattering signal from the sample and to reduce the effect of radiation damage ( in comparison to low fluence imaging experiments , where the damage accumulates over many shots ) .",
    "the sample is destroyed during each measurement ( so  called _ diffract  and  destroy _ method @xcite ) .",
    "a single diffractive pattern is so noisy that averaging over patterns corresponding to the same molecular orientation is needed in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "so for a 3d reconstruction , many patterns of the same molecule are needed .",
    "x - ray diffraction gives information on the electron density of the system , so any changes of the electron density due to the radiation damage influence the diffraction patterns .",
    "there are three main damage components : ( i ) atoms are loosing bound electrons due to ionization , ( ii ) ionized atoms may move from their original positions , and ( iii ) scattering on the increasing free - electron density contributes to the signal . in order to investigate the effect of these damage components , detailed modeling and understanding of ionization dynamics are needed .",
    "the continuum approach ( boltzmann @xcite , hydrodynamic @xcite ) is an efficient way of modeling damage within large systems .",
    "however , the presently available continuum methods follow the average single - particle densities , and the recorded diffraction intensities reflect two - particle correlations .",
    "the information on two - particle correlations is inherently not accessible from a single - particle continuum approach .    in this paper",
    "we analyze this limitation of continuum models and discuss the applicability of continuum models for imaging studies . in order to study this specific problem",
    "we do not need to construct a full ab initio model of radiation damage .",
    "we analyze this problem with a simplified molecular dynamics model reproducing the conditions typical for coherent diffraction imaging studies that are known from experiments and from the theoretical studies of radiation damage @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the relation between total ( elastic and inelastic ) diffracted signal and its corresponding estimate from the continuum model . in section iii",
    "we describe the physical conditions developing within xfel irradiated samples . in section",
    "iv we derive an approximate formula for signal scattered off an xfel irradiated sample .",
    "it is derived from the estimates obtained with single - particle densities .",
    "this formula is then tested against numerical simulations in section v. the results obtained are also discussed therein .",
    "the appendix contains information on the simulation details .",
    "finally , in section vi our conclusions are listed .",
    "the state of an imaged sample during a cdi experiment is dynamic , it changes with time as a consequence of the sample irradiation .",
    "stochastically occurring ionizations change the electronic states of the atoms at different times , the density of the released free electrons increases .",
    "therefore the results of a cdi experiment , even when repeated under the same conditions , will vary , due to the stochasticity .",
    "we call a unique time evolution that occurs during one cdi experiment a single _ realization_.    in a single realization the total ( elastic and inelastic ) x - ray intensity scattered off a system of electrons in state @xmath1 at time @xmath2 is proportional to @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron density operator , and its fourier - transform , respectively : @xmath6 and the operator @xmath7 is the position operator in the heisenberg picture .    assuming the coherence time of the pulse to be short compared to the timescales of the processes occurring within the irradiated sample , the time integrated intensity can be approximated as an incoherent sum of the intensities scattered at instantaneous snapshots of the system .",
    "the number of photons scattered at the vector @xmath8 during a single realization is then proportional to : @xmath9 the function @xmath10 describes the average temporal envelope of the pulse , i. e. the modulus of the pulse amplitude squared , which is ensemble - averaged over xfel shots . during an imaging experiment a large number of patterns from single shots is collected and summed up , in order to obtain an average pattern .",
    "therefore the average of the recorded signal _ over the measured realizations ( r ) _ must be formed : @xmath11 for operators the symbol @xmath12 implies the averaging of the expectation value over realizations , i.  e.  for an observable @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability that the system is in one of the realized states @xmath16 . for a classical quantity @xmath17 averaging over realization simplifies to : @xmath18 where the quantity , @xmath17 , assumes a value , @xmath19 , with a probability , @xmath15 , at time @xmath2 .",
    "here we would like to emphasize that our analysis is not restricted to systems in thermal equilibrium , so that the different realizations are not corresponding merely to the thermal fluctuations of an equilibrated system but may also lead through the non - equilibrium stages of the system evolution .",
    "the continuum models , used to simulate the evolution of the irradiated systems , describe dynamical properties of electrons and ions , using average single ",
    "particle densities @xmath20 .",
    "the intensity that one can construct directly from these average densities is : @xmath21 the difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 depends on two  particle correlations during individual realizations .",
    "detailed simulations of radiation damage @xcite reveal the typical ionization dynamics within an x - ray irradiated biological sample during an imaging experiment .",
    "biological samples are typically built up from light elements like c , n , o , h. only a few atoms of heavy elements are present , e.  g.  cl , s , fe .",
    "the primary events that initiate radiation damage are the photoionization events @xcite .",
    "photoelectrons released by x - rays from light elements have high energy ( @xmath24kev ) .",
    "they can leave the irradiated system within a few fs , so that the net charge of the system starts to increase . during inner - shell photoionization ,",
    "core holes are created .",
    "these holes are then filled by electrons from the outer shells within a few tens of fs . for light elements auger",
    "decay is dominant @xcite .",
    "auger electrons have lower energies ( @xmath25 few hundred evs ) , and they can be trapped within the charged sample .",
    "these quasi - free electrons cause further ionizations that end up in secondary electron cascading @xcite .",
    "it is energetically preferred for the quasi - free electrons to move towards the center of the sample , forming a net - neutral core with ions .",
    "this leads to the formation of a positively charged outer shell of ions around the neutral core . for samples large enough and",
    "sufficiently highly ionized , even high - energy photoelectrons can be trapped in the core , enhancing the temperature of the quasi - free electrons .",
    "conditions of the electron plasma can be characterized by comparing the average potential energy of the electrostatic interaction between the electrons , @xmath26 , to their temperature , @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density of the electrons . in case of @xmath30 ,",
    "coulomb interaction dominates the electron dynamics and the plasma is strongly coupled . if @xmath31 , the coulomb interaction is suppressed , and the plasma is weakly coupled .",
    "another parameter , the ratio of the electron temperature and the fermi energy , @xmath32 , gives information on the quantum effects within the system @xcite : @xmath33 at electron temperatures higher than the fermi energy ( @xmath34 ) , a classical description is adequate , while at @xmath35 , a quantum mechanical treatment is needed .    according to the aforementioned simulations @xcite , the typical electron density at the center of a biomolecule is around 10@xmath36@xmath37 , the electron temperature is @xmath38ev , when photoelectrons are not trapped , and @xmath39ev when photoelectrons are trapped . for the values of temperature , @xmath40ev and @xmath41ev , the plasma parameters are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , respectively , so that the plasma of quasi - free electrons can be treated as classical and ideal .",
    "it should be noted that ions do not form a plasma during an imaging experiment .",
    "as the imaging pulses are short ( @xmath25tens of femtoseconds ) compared to electron - ion equilibration time ( @xmath25few ps ) , ions remain cold during the pulse .",
    "unscreened ions from the outer shell can move radially , due to the repulsive coulomb forces .",
    "however , if the pulse is not longer than several fs , those unscreened ions will also not relocate during the pulse @xcite . as a result ,",
    "during the imaging pulse , the initially neutral system evolves into a two - regime system consisting of frozen ions embedded in a thermalized free - electron plasma .",
    "in this section we investigate in detail how the scattered signal averaged over the realizations reflects the changing electron density within the irradiated sample .",
    "we follow the approach proposed by chihara in ref .",
    "@xcite , and further applied in many works investigating x - ray scattering on plasmas , e.  g.   @xcite",
    ". however , in our case we will apply it to a system that can be far from thermal equilibrium at its initial evolution stages .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard plasma applications that usually consider systems in thermal equilibrium .",
    "following @xcite , we separate the total electron density operator , @xmath4 , into the the bound electron component , @xmath46 , and the unbound electron component . in general",
    ", one could develop a model for describing the dynamics of all electrons , also those ones that escape from the sample .",
    "however , the currently available continuum models @xcite follow the dynamics of particles only within a restricted volume .",
    "therefore we separate the unbound electron density operator into two components .",
    "one component refers to the electrons that escaped from the sample , @xmath47 , and the other one to the electrons trapped inside the sample , @xmath48 . from eqs .",

    "first we analyze the effect of the diagonal terms , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and later the effect of the cross terms , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "we can express the bound electron density operator as a convolution of atomic electron densities , @xmath58 and of the atomic position operators , @xmath59 @xcite : @xmath60 its fourier transform then reads : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total number of atoms , @xmath63 is the position operator of atom @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the fourier transform of the density @xmath66 .",
    "the scattered intensity averaged over realizations is : @xmath67 radiation damage can affect the intensity pattern in two ways : ( i ) form factors of atoms can decrease due to the progressing ionization , ( ii ) positions of ions can change due to the coulomb interaction within the ionized system .",
    "the latter effect can be overcome by applying pulses short enough ( @xmath68fs @xcite ) , which are available at xfels @xcite .",
    "however , the reduction of the form factors can not be eliminated .",
    "assuming static atomic positions , @xmath69 in all realizations , and no correlation between ionization events of different atoms , so that @xmath70 for @xmath71 , the corresponding averaged intensity is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the atomic form factor , @xmath74 is the classical bound electron density .",
    "deriving the second row in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound_final ] ) , we used the following relation : @xmath75 if the binding energy of a bound electron is much less than the energy of the incoming photon , the intensity @xmath76 scattered inelastically on the atom / ion , @xmath64 , can be approximated as being proportional to the number of its bound electrons , @xmath77 , multiplied by the intensity , @xmath78 , scattered inelastically from the neutral element of atomic number , @xmath79 : @xmath80 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound_final ] ) ( last row ) , the total averaged scattered intensity from bound electrons is then the sum of : ( i ) the inelastic incoherent scattering component , @xmath81 , ( ii ) elastic incoherent scattering component containing the variance of the atomic form factors of the individual ions , and ( iii ) the density , @xmath82 that describes coherent elastic scattering .",
    "similar terms appear in the final formula of ref .",
    "@xcite , except for that term which is a consequence of the externally driven ionization dynamics .",
    "we investigate now the contribution of trapped electrons to the imaging pattern . under the conditions typical for cdi studies",
    "electrons can be treated as classical particles . in what follows we",
    "will then replace the electron - density - operator expectation values , @xmath83 , with their corresponding classical equivalents , @xmath84 .",
    "the classical electron density and its fourier transform , defined for @xmath85 trapped electrons , located at positions @xmath86 at time @xmath2 , then are : @xmath87 and the realization - averaged signal scattered from trapped electrons is proportional to : @xmath88 using the two - particle distribution function @xcite , one can rewrite it further as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the two - particle distribution function at time @xmath2 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath90 is imposed by the non - equilibrium evolution of the considered system .    in the second row of eq .",
    "( [ itt ] ) the first term is a @xmath91-independent shift given by the number of trapped electrons , @xmath85 .",
    "the second term depends on the average electron density .",
    "the third term contains the statistical information about the two - particle correlations .",
    "this information is not accesible within single - particle continuum approach , as considered here . the first term and the third one correspond to the incoherent scattering , whereas the second one corresponds to coherent scattering on free electrons as in chihara s formula in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "neglecting all correlations in ( [ itt ] ) , we arrive at the following estimate : @xmath92 in the above derivations we assumed that the number of trapped electrons , @xmath85 , is identical for all realizations at any time @xmath2 . as the @xmath85 distribution results from a stochastic process , this assumption is generally not valid . in the general case , we should replace @xmath85 with its average over realizations at time @xmath2 , @xmath93 .",
    "this is an accurate approximation if the number of particles in individual realizations is large .",
    "for a small number of particles this may introduce a large relative error .",
    "however , in our case , the contribution of trapped electrons to the overall scattered intensity is small , so in any case it should not introduce a significant error .",
    "we note that the approximation , eq .",
    "( [ ittu ] ) , could be further improved by taking into account correlations . in general , especially in case of short pulses , the electrons may not reach thermal equilibrium during the pulse .",
    "this would require a time - dependent parametrization of @xmath90 .",
    "if the pulse is long enough compared to the electron thermalization timescale , the two - particle distribution function for electrons could be approximated by the equilibrium one .",
    "energetic photoelectrons leave the sample soon after the exposure to the x - ray pulse starts .",
    "however , they may stay within the focus of the beam during the imaging pulse and also contribute to the diffractive patterns .    in order to describe their contribution to the intensity , the same approximate formula as for the trapped electrons , eq.([eq : trapped_final ] ) , can be applied : @xmath94 in case of escaped electrons , their density is dilute , e.g. , the distances between escaped electrons are on average large .",
    "their contribution will then show up mainly at small values of @xmath91 , limited by the inverse of the size of the escaped electron cloud .",
    "we explain here that the relevant @xmath91 range for imaging studies is defined by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the size of the object ( here the size of the electron cloud ) , and @xmath97 is the desired resolution .",
    "therefore , if the continuum model does not provide information on @xmath98 , we can approximate the effect of the escaped electrons as : @xmath99 which is accurate enough in the high @xmath91 regime , limited by the inverse resolution , @xmath100 .",
    "the escaping high - energy electrons are typically located at large distances from other particles , so the potential energy of their individual interaction with other particles is much smaller than their kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the coulomb correlations between bound electrons and escaped electrons , and between trapped electrons and escaped electrons , can be neglected , and the respective cross terms factorize to : @xmath101 following our discussion from the previous subsection , we can neglect these terms in the considered high @xmath91 regime .",
    "the correlation between bound and trapped electrons , originating from the same initial process of ionization , strongly decreases with time as the number of particles increases and the particle cloud evolves . however , there are still coulomb correlations between these particles .",
    "if we compare the potential energy of the electrons trapped in the field of the ions to their kinetic energy at the typical simulation parameters @xcite , we obtain : @xmath102 if the electron - ion system is weakly coupled ( @xmath103 ) , we can then neglect the correlations between the different density terms , and the cross term can be factorized as : @xmath104 again , the cross terms then depend solely on average densities , which are known from the continuum model .",
    "a similar cross term appears in chihara s formula in ref .",
    "@xcite .      here",
    "we collect the terms that we derived in the previous subsections .",
