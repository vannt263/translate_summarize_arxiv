    "the telescope array ( ta ) is the largest detector of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) in the northern hemisphere ( see figure  [ fig : ta ] ) .",
    "it is designed to explore the origin of uhecrs and the mechanisms of production , acceleration at the sources , and propagation in the inter - galactic space .",
    "the ta  @xcite consists of 38 fluorescence detectors ( fds ) and an array of 507 surface detectors ( sds ) .",
    "the fds measure longitudinal development and primary energies of air showers in the atmosphere from the amounts of light emitted by atmospheric molecules excited by charged particles in the showers @xcite .",
    "the sds measure arrival timings and local densities of the shower particles at the ground . the arrival direction and primary energy of an air shower in sd",
    "is determined from the relative timing differences of particle arrivals between sds , and from the lateral distribution of local particle densities around the shower core , respectively @xcite .",
    "the advantage of fd is that air shower energies can be determined calorimetrically knowing the fluorescence yield , which is the amount of lights emitted by air molecules per total energy losses of charged particles in the showers .",
    "however there is a rather large uncertainty in arrival directions of cosmic rays determined with fd in monocular mode , in which time differences between signals of the photo - tube pixels with small angular separations are used .",
    "a _ hybrid _ reconstruction technique , using the timing information of an sd at which air shower particles hit the ground , solves the problem .",
    "our monte - carlo study shows that the inclusion of sd timing in fd monocular reconstruction significantly improves the accuracy in the determination of shower geometry ( a similar method has been used in the hires - mia  @xcite and the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe in full detail of our hybrid reconstruction method , and discuss the energy spectrum of ultra - high energy cosmic rays derived from this with improved accuracies in arrival directions and primary energies .",
    "another advantage of our strategy is that the aperture of the detector can be simply calculated from that of the sd , which is almost determined geometrically .",
    "this technique is also important to determine the composition of primary cosmic rays . here ,",
    "the fd s measure the shower development maximum in the atmosphere , x@xmath1 , which is a parameter sensitive to the mass composition .",
    "since this measurement is very sensitive to the shower geometry reconstruction , the hybrid technique s improved geometrical accuracy is important .",
    "the present work on the spectrum sets the stage for subsequent publications on primary composition using the same technique .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the ta detector in section  [ sec : ta ] .",
    "the hybrid reconstruction method is given in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section  [ sec : mc ] explains air shower mc simulation and detector mc simulation .",
    "we compare the distributions of data and mc in section  [ sec : comparison ] , and present the energy spectrum in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "the conclusion is described in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the ta site is located in millard county , utah , usa .",
    "the sd array covers an area of about 700  km@xmath2 .",
    "each of the 3-m@xmath2 sds includes two layers of plastic scintillators wrapped with tyvek reflective sheets in a stainless steel box .",
    "scintillation photons produced by the passage of charged particles in air showers through scintillators are collected by a one - inch - diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) for each layer .",
    "the duty cycle of the sd is nearly 100% .",
    "full details on the sds can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the ta fds are installed in three stations ( black rock mesa [ br ] , long ridge [ lr ] , and middle drum [ md ] ) , which overlook the surface array .",
    "each station contains 12 or 14 telescopes ( 12 at br , 12 at lr and 14 at md ) , observing 3@xmath3 to 31@xmath3 in elevation , and 108@xmath3 for br and lr and 120@xmath3 for md in azimuth .",
    "the 14 md telescopes are refurbished hires-1 detectors @xcite .",
    "the telescopes are operated on clear , moonless nights .",
    "each telescope collects and focuses ultraviolet fluorescence light emitted by nitrogen molecules in the wake of the extensive air showers using a spherical mirror of 6.8  m@xmath2 effective area .",
    "this light is detected by cameras which consist of 256 pmts ( hamamatsu ; r9508 ) .",
    "the pmt signals are sampled by fadc - based electronics with an effective rate of 10  mhz and a 14-bits dynamic range .",
    "detailed description of daq system are presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have a steerable mono - static lidar system @xcite at the br site to monitor atmospheric transparency by measuring backscattered light from a dedicated 355-nm nd : yag laser .",
    "the process of analysis consists of four steps : pmt selection , shower geometry reconstruction , reconstruction of longitudinal shower profile and quality cuts .",
    "the key idea of the hybrid reconstruction is the use of timing information from one or more sds in addition to the fd tube timings .",
    "the sd timing at which the shower plane crosses the ground gives an `` anchor '' in the conventional fd timing fit and significantly improves the accuracy in shower geometry determination compared to that of the fd monocular mode .",
    "the energy of the uhecr is measured via the calorimetric technique of the fd .",
    "an example of the observed hybrid data is shown in figure  [ fig : event ] .",
    "the shower analysis procedure begins with selection of pmts used in the geometry reconstruction among the @xmath4 pmts in an fd station .",
    "the pmts to be used are chosen from the `` triggered camera '' , in which a shower track is found , and its neighbouring cameras .",
    "first the pmts with signals greater than @xmath5 above the background fluctuation are selected .",
    "second the shower track is identified from the pmt hit pattern in the camera(s ) , and pmts that are spatially and temporally isolated from the track are rejected .",
    "the bundle of the pointing direction vectors of the pmts selected at this stage defines the shower detector plane ( sdp ) .",
    "further selection is made by discarding off - sdp pmts .",
    "these procedures are iterated until no more pmts are rejected or reintroduced .",
    "the geometry of the event is determined from the pointing directions and timings of the pmts of the fd camera :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the expected timing and elevation angle in the sdp for the _",
    "i_-th pmt , respectively , @xmath9 is the time when the air shower reached the ground , @xmath10 is the distance from the fd station to the core , and @xmath11 is the elevation angle of the air shower in the sdp ( figure  [ fig : sdp ] ) .    for an event that has timing information of one sd near the core , @xmath9 is expressed by :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the position of the sd , @xmath14 is the projection of @xmath13 onto the sdp , is the direction of the shower axis , @xmath15 is the timing of the leading edge of the sd signal .",
    "the quantity to be minimized in the fitting is written as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the fluctuation of the signal timing .",
    "sds with distances greater than 1.2 km from the line of intersection of the sdp and the ground are rejected , and those farther than 1.5 km from the shower core are also rejected .",
    "these procedures are repeated and only one sd that gives the best @xmath18 is chosen .",
    "the resolution of the arrival direction is about 0.9  degrees ( see figure  [ fig : arrivaldirectionresol ] ) which is a significant improvement compared to that in fd monocular mode ( @xmath19 5 degrees ) .",
    "once the shower geometry is determined , the longitudinal profile of the shower development can be reconstructed from the fd data ( the amount of fluorescence photons emitted at various points along the `` known '' shower axis ) .",
    "however there are other components which contribute to the detected signals : @xmath20 light beamed near the direction of an air shower , and scattered by atmospheric molecules and aerosols .    in reconstruction of the longitudinal profile , all the detector characteristics including the shadowing effect by the telescope structure , gaps between the mirror segments , the mirror reflectivities , non - uniformities of the pmt cathode sensitivities etc .",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "this is straightforward in detector simulation using ray - tracing , but not in data reconstruction ( for example , it is not possible to know the position at which a photon hit the photo - cathode of a pmt ) .",
    "therefore we employ an `` inverse mc method '' in shower reconstruction to find an mc shower which best reproduces the data considering all the photon components ( fluorescence and @xmath20 photons ) and detector response .",
    "we assume that the profile of the shower development is represented by the gaisser - hillas function  @xcite ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the atmospheric depth , @xmath23 is the depth at the shower maximum , @xmath24 is the interaction length of the shower particles , and @xmath25 is the offset of @xmath22 . since @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not affect the bulk of the profile , we fix those as 70 g/@xmath26 and 0 g/@xmath26 , respectively , and only consider the one parameter @xmath23 i.e. @xmath27 .    for each air shower event ,",
    "the expected number of photo - electrons in the output of the @xmath28-th pmt in the case of a given @xmath23 is obtained by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the type of photon production ( fluorescence light , direct @xmath20 light , @xmath20 from rayleigh scattering , and @xmath20 from aerosol scattering ) , @xmath22 is the slant depth along the shower axis , @xmath31 is the total number of photons originated at the depth @xmath22 , @xmath32 is the angular distribution of photons of type @xmath30 emitted at @xmath22 , @xmath33 is the effective mirror area , and @xmath34 is the distance between the emission point @xmath22 to the fd station . @xmath35",
    "is the detection sensitivity which includes structure of our telescope and the non - uniformity of photo - cathode surface , @xmath36 is the wavelength , @xmath37 is the wavelength spectrum of the process @xmath30 , @xmath38 is atmospheric transparency , and @xmath39 is the detector efficiency . here , atmospheric transparency and detector efficiency are given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the transmittance of the molecular and aerosol atmosphere , @xmath43 is the mirror reflectance , @xmath44 is the transmittance of the `` bg3 '' uv - filter and camera window , and @xmath45 includes the efficiency of the pmt ( quantum efficiency , correction efficiency and gain ) .",

    "@xmath46    where @xmath47 is the sum of the photo - electrons at each pmt , @xmath48 is the total number of photo - electrons in the fd station as described in equation [ eq : nexp ] .    after fitting for @xmath23 , @xmath49",
    "is obtained by scaling as follows ,    @xmath50    the primary energy is obtained by integration of the gaisser - hillas function ( equation [ eq : g - h ] ) with a correction for the missing energy carried away by neutral particles .      to ensure reconstruction quality",
    ", we only accept events that satisfy the following criteria :    * the number of pmts used in the reconstruction is greater than 20 . *",
    "the zenith angle of the reconstructed shower axis is less than 55 degrees . *",
    "the shower core is inside the edges of the sd array . *",
    "the angle between the reconstructed shower axis and the telescope is greater than 20 degrees .",
    "* @xmath23 has to be observed .",
    "if events pass the cuts for both the br and lr stations , we adopt the reconstruction result of the station in which the larger number of pmts are involved .",
    "an example of the reconstructed shower profile is shown in figure  [ fig : event - lng ] . for all energy ranges ,",
    "the energy resolution is on the order of 7% ( see figure  [ fig : energyresol ] ) .",
    "the performance of our detectors , the reconstruction programs , and the aperture are evaluated using our monte - carlo ( mc ) program .",
    "the ta mc package consists of two parts : the air shower generation part and the detector simulation part . in order to reproduce the real observation conditions in the mc",
    ", we use environmental data and calibration data that we actually measured at the site assigning a date and time for each mc event .",
    "the output of the mc simulation is written out in the same format of the real shower data , so both the mc events and the real shower data can be analysed with the same reconstruction program .",
    "we generate cosmic - ray showers using the corsika  @xcite based mc simulation code developed for ta .",
    "the air showers are generated with 10@xmath51 thinning to keep fluctuations and event generation times reasonable , and `` dethinned '' to restore the information of individual particles at the ground  @xcite .",
    "we use qgsjet-@xmath52 - 03  @xcite for high energy hadronic interactions and fluka-2008.3c  @xcite for low energies .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are modeled by egs4 @xcite .",
    "we use proton primary particles for the calculation of the aperture .",
    "we also use iron to estimate the systematic uncertainty of the aperture .",
    "we generated about 20-million eas mc simulation events with primary energies ranging from 10@xmath53  ev to 10@xmath54  ev and from 0@xmath3 to 60@xmath3 in zenith angle . for data and mc comparison ,",
    "the mc events are sampled with the energy spectrum measured by the hires experiment  @xcite , excluding the gzk suppression effect  @xcite .",
    "a spectral index of 3.25 was used below 10@xmath55 ev and 2.81 above 10@xmath55 ev .",
    "the positions of the shower cores on the ground were generated within 25  km of the center of the site .",
    "the arrival directions are distributed isotropically in the local sky .",
    "the corsika particle outputs ( position and momentum of particles at the ground ) are used to calculate the energy deposit in each sd with geant4  @xcite .",
    "the response of the sd electronics is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the trigger scheme of the sd array , a three - fold coincidence of adjacent sds with signals greater than three particle - equivalent , is implemented in the mc .",
    "the fd simulation includes fluorescence and @xmath20 photon generations , telescope optics  @xcite , detector calibration  @xcite , and the response of the electronics  @xcite .",
    "the corsika output of the longitudinal profile of energy deposit by the charged particles in the atmosphere is used to calculate the number of fluorescence photons emitted at each @xmath56 step .",
    "for the fluorescence yield , ( the number of photons per energy deposit ) , we use the value reported by kakimoto _",
    "et al . _",
    "the temperature and pressure dependence of the fluorescence yield is also taken into account by using the radiosonde data  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of wavelengths of the fluorescence photons are chosen using the spectrum measured by the flash experiment  @xcite .",
    "for simulation of @xmath20 light emission , we use the energy spectrum of charged particles and angular distribution of produced photons based on corsika  @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath20 photons directly detected by the fds and also scattered photons by molecules and aerosols . a date and time is assigned for each mc event by sampling from the real observation period .",
    "the radiosonde data of pressure and temperature as a function of elevation is used to model the molecular atmosphere , and the lidar data is used to describe the distribution of aerosols . the measured vertical aerosol optical depth ( vaod )",
    "is 0.035  @xcite .",
    "the telescope simulator includes the segmented mirrors , optical filters , and all obstructions such as camera frames , camera boxes , and shutter frames .",
    "the nightsky background and its fluctuation is taken into account in the simulation by using the mean and variance of the baseline of the pmt outputs recorded in the real data at the assigned time of each mc event .      from our preparatory study using real shower events detected with both fd and sd",
    ", we found that the fd and sd measure the energies of air showers differently .",
    "the average of the ratios of the energies independently determined by sd and fd is @xmath57  @xcite . here",
    "the energy determination in sd from the particle information at the ground is fully dependent on air shower mc which is based upon hadronic interaction models derived from accelerator experiments in lower energy regions , while the energy can be determined calorimetrically in fd .",
    "therefore we find that an sd reconstruction program tuned by a shower mc like corsika gives @xmath58 higher energy than the `` true '' energy measured by fd because of the limitations of our present knowledge of air shower phenomena .",
    "this difference in the energy scales of fd and sd must be taken into account in the detector simulation and evaluation of the aperture as a function of energy .",
    "we use a corsika event of energy @xmath59 for detector simulation and aperture evaluation at energy @xmath60 , by scaling the longitudinal energy deposit profile of the charged particles in the atmosphere to be measured by fd , and keeping the particle information at the ground and energy deposit in sds unchanged .",
    "this is simpler than increasing the energy in the sd part , i.e. the number of particles at the ground and/or the energy deposit in the sds .",
    "we use an elongation rate @xmath61 to shift @xmath23 in accordance with the @xmath62 energy scaling in the shower profile , but this gives a negligible effect in the energy measurement .",
    "the aperture for hybrid events grows with energy , and includes more sds .",
    "however , in the energy region above 10@xmath63  ev , the aperture for hybrid events saturates since the array edges limit the growth . thus , the uncertainty of the sd + fd aperture estimation is smaller than that of fd monocular analysis where the aperture continues to grow .",
    "the lower energy bound is given by the efficiency of the sd trigger , a three - fold coincidence of adjacent sds with signals greater than three particle - equivalent , which falls significantly below @xmath64 ev .",
    "the typical reconstruction efficiency after all quality cuts is about 70% .",
    "the efficiency is reduced for events with higher energies .",
    "this is caused by the requirement that x@xmath1 has to be observed within the field of view and the fact that the shower maximum of the events with higher energies sometimes occurs under the ground .",
    "to measure the spectrum with reliable reconstruction , we use data collected on clear and moonless nights with minimal cloud cover in the view of the detector .",
    "weather conditions are recorded for each observation night based on human fd operator s logs . in this analysis",
    ", we use 70% of the total observation time based on the condition that cloud coverage is less than half the sky . the total observation time after subtracting the dead time of the detector is 1480 hours for br and lr , which consists of 990 hours for stereo observation , 330 hours for br only and 160 hours for lr only .    the aperture of hybrid events with e @xmath65 10@xmath63 ev is 1.2@xmath6610@xmath67m@xmath2 sr , which is similar to the sd aperture",
    ". multiplication by on - time and aperture gives the hybrid exposure for br and lr .",
    "this is calculated to be 6@xmath6610@xmath68 m@xmath2  sr  s ( figure  [ fig : hybexposure ] ) .",
    "the quality of the generated mc events is examined by comparing to real data to validate the aperture calculation .",
    "here we use mc proton and iron showers .",
    "we use shower events detected with the sds and fds at the br and lr sites collected from may 2008 to september 2010 .",
    "a total of 3405 events were recorded in the period , and 2203 events remain after hybrid reconstruction and quality cuts ( see section [ sec : analysis ] ) . among the 2203 events , 1276 are from br and 1040",
    "are from lr , and we find 113 `` stereo '' events that are detected at both br and lr .",
    "the difference in the number of events from the two sites is consistent with the difference in the telescope on - time and the slightly different aperture due to the elevations of the sites and the distance to the closest sds .",
    "the energy distribution of the observed hybrid events is shown in figure  [ fig : hybenergy ] .    here",
    "we show the comparison of mc and the real data in terms of several quantities that are sensitive to the aperture , the shower impact parameter @xmath69 , and the shower arrival direction angles @xmath70 ( figure [ fig : rp ] @xmath19 [ fig : azimuth ] ) .",
    "for all the parameters , the data and mc events are in excellent agreement .",
    "the energy spectrum of cosmic rays , @xmath71 , is calculated from the number of events in an energy bin and the exposure ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the number of events in a given energy bin , @xmath74 is the energy - dependent exposure obtained from mc . figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the energy spectrum above 10@xmath75  ev . for comparison ,",
    "the spectra of agasa  @xcite , hires  @xcite , auger  @xcite , ta md  @xcite and ta sd  @xcite are also plotted in the same figure .",
    "the ta hybrid spectrum and our previously published spectra are in agreement with hires results .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in energy determination are summarized in table  [ tbl : syse ] .",
    "systematic uncertainties includes uncertainties in the fluorescence yield ( 11% ) , atmospheric attenuation ( 11% )  @xcite , the absolute detector calibration ( 10% )  @xcite and reconstruction ( 10% ) .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty in energy determination is 21% adding all the uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "this translates to a systematic uncertainty in the flux , @xmath76 , of 41% assuming a spectral index of -2.8  @xcite .",
    "a systematic uncertainty in the energy spectrum also comes from the difference in the aperture of the detector to primary cosmic rays of different nuclear types , as shown in figure [ fig : hybexposure ] .",
    "the difference in the aperture for proton and iron showers increases at lower energies , and amounts to @xmath77 at @xmath78 ev , which decreases @xmath71 by at most @xmath79 if there are heavier components .",
    "the telescope array including the fluorescence telescopes and the surface detector array has been fully operational since may 2008 .",
    "we have developed a hybrid reconstruction technique for air showers using the longitudinal shower profile from fd and the particle arrival timing at the sd .",
    "the arrival direction and energy of an air shower can be determined with accuracies of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these are significantly improved compared to fd monocular mode .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in determination of energies is evaluated as @xmath82 .",
    "we determine the energy spectrum of cosmic rays with energies above @xmath0 using the hybrid reconstruction technique using both fd and sd data .",
    "the aperture of the detectors is evaluated by taking into account the details of detector performance and atmospheric conditions at the site .",
