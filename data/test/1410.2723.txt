    "the idea of the ifm has been applied to `` counterfactual computation '' @xcite , a setup in which one particular outcome of a computation becomes known in spite of the fact that the computer did not run the algorithm .",
    "noh @xcite created counterfactual cryptography , a method for secret key distribution using events in which the particle was not present in the transmission channel .",
    "noh used a random choice of orthogonal input states ( like in @xcite ) in contrast with the non - orthogonal states of bb84 cryptographic protocol @xcite .",
    "it was argued @xcite , that a modification of the counterfactual computation proposed above , which includes quantum zeno effect , can achieve counterfactuality for _ all _ outcomes of the computation .",
    "recently , this idea has been used for performing `` counterfactual communication '' @xcite , which supposedly allowed to send information from bob to alice without transferring any particle between them .",
    "the transmission happens in a counterfactual way : the mere possibility of transmitting the particle allows transmitting the value of the bit .",
    "i find all these results very paradoxical since they contradict physical intuition of causality : information is usually transmitted continuously in space .",
    "i argued @xcite that to resolve the paradoxical feature of the ifm one has to adopt the many - worlds interpretation ( mwi ) of quantum mechanics @xcite , in which the particle touches the object in a parallel world restoring causality at least within the complete physical universe which includes all the worlds .",
    "however , i believe that a protocol which can transmit both values of a bit without any particle present in the transmission channel is impossible , irrespectively of the interpretation of quantum mechanics one adopts .",
    "i have expressed this opinion already @xcite , but more protocols were suggested @xcite and the controversy remains open @xcite .",

    "the particle might be lost or detected by @xmath1 . however , if the condition holds , the probability for a failure is vanishingly small .",
    "the probability for loosing the particle and getting no result is of order @xmath29 for bit 1 and @xmath30 for bit 0 .",
    "the click of @xmath1 tells alice with certainty that the bit is 1 , and the click of @xmath0 tells her that the bit is 0 with only a very small probability for an error : about @xmath31 .",

    "bob leaves the inner interferometers untouched .",
    "then , each inner chain of the interferometers changes the phase of the quantum state of the particle : @xmath40 .",
    "a state @xmath10 of the inner interferometer is a state @xmath37 of the external interferometer .",

    "now , after every two beam splitters of the inner chain , the wave packet comes back to the left side without acquiring additional phase .",

    "this is an ideal direct communication protocol : theoretically , when there are no losses , there is zero probability for an error .",
    "the question i want to answer in this paper is : can the protocols of sections [ directcf ] and [ directnonzeno ] be considered as _ counterfactual _ communication protocols ?",
    "let us consider the following three statements which try to capture the meaning of counterfactuality .",
    "\\1 ) the probability of finding the particle in the transmission channel is zero or can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "\\2 ) the particle did not pass through the transmission channel .",
    "\\3 ) the particle was not present in the transmission channel ( or the probability of its existence in the transmission channel can be made arbitrarily small ) .    in the papers on counterfactual communication",
    "@xcite all these statements were considered to be interchangeable , i.e. all are true and each one of them represents counterfactuality .",
    "i argue that the situation is more subtle and clarification is needed .",
    "statement ( 1 ) .",
    "a non - demolition measurement of the presence of the particle in the transmission channel disturbs completely the operation of the communication protocols which are considered .",
    "when such a measurement is added to the protocol , bob does not transmit information to alice by his actions .",
    "so , the truth or falsehood of this statement is not a decisive indication of the counterfactuality of the protocols .",
    "however , since there is a separate controversy about the validity of this statement for the two protocols under discussion , it should be clarified too .",
    "the papers on counterfactual communication claim that this is a correct statement while i @xcite claim that in these protocols the probability of finding the particle in the transmission channel is 1 .",
    "the source of this controversy is our different assumptions .",
    "the communication protocols involve preparation and detection of the particle .",
    "i consider the probability of finding the particle in the transmission channel under the condition of the same final detection as in the protocol without intermediate measurement . in this case",
    ", the probability of finding the particle is exactly 1 , since had it it not been found , the result of the final detection could not be that of the undisturbed protocol .",
    "on the other hand , without the condition on the result of the final detection , the probability to detect the particle in the transmission channel is vanishingly small .",
    "these are two correct statements about the probability of finding the particle in the intermediate measurement : the probability is 1 when both the proper preparation and the proper final detection are done , and it is vanishingly small when only the preparation of the particle is assumed . none of these statements shed much light on the issue of counterfactuality of the protocols _ without _ intermediate non - demolition measurements .",
    "statement ( 2 ) .",
    "in contrast to such a claim for a classical particle , the meaning of this statement for a quantum particle is not well defined . for a classical particle , the operational meaning",
    "of ( 2 ) is ( 1 ) , but as discussed above , statement ( 1 ) is not helpful in the quantum case . in a double slit experiment with a screen , there is no good answer through which slit the particle passed and through which it did not pass .",
    "however , if the detector which finds the particle is placed after one of the slits , and the wave packet passing through the other slit does not reach the detector , then it is frequently declared , following wheeler @xcite , that the particle did not pass through the second slit .",
    "( note that this contradicts the textbook picture , attributed to von neumann , according to which the wave passes through both slits and then collapses to the location of the detector . )",
    "if we adopt wheeler s definition , then statement ( 2 ) is correct for the protocol of section [ directcf ] .",
    "the wave packets of the particle passing through the transmission channel do not reach the detector which detects the particle in this protocol .",
    "i , however , argued that we should not adopt wheeler s definition for discussing the past of a quantum particle @xcite .",
    "the concept of a quantum particle passing through a channel has no clear meaning in the standard quantum mechanics in which particles do not have trajectories .",
    "it is rigorously defined in the framework of bohmian mechanics @xcite . however , since the authors of papers on counterfactual communication never mentioned bohmian mechanics , it is not particularly relevant to the current controversy .",
    "still , due to to its conceptual importance i , following the advice of a referee , will provide the analysis in the framework of the bohmian interpretation , but only at the end of the paper , in section [ bohm ] .",
    "statement ( 3 ) . apart from bohmian mechanics , quantum mechanics",
    "does not provide a rigorous meaning also for statement ( 3 ) . without a clear ontological definition",
    "i suggest to introduce an operational meaning .",
    "we can not rely on an operational definition based on statement ( 1 ) , since strong , even nondemolition , measurements change the setup we want to analyze .",
    "so , my proposal is to look at the _ weak _ trace the particle leaves .",
    "all particles interact locally with the environment .",
    "if the particle is present in a particular place , it leaves some trace there , and it does not leave any trace where it was not present . therefore , we can run the protocol we want to analyze , and then look at the trace left in the environment . if in the transmission channel there is a non - zero trace , we will say that the protocol is not counterfactual .",
    "the counterpart of ( 3 ) , a definition of counterfactual as a process without a local trace , is less robust , because , although very unlikely , it is possible that the particle changed the local environment via some local interaction , but then changed it back to its original state .",
    "since we are all along analyzing interference experiments , the trace left by the particles has to be small , as otherwise the interference is destroyed .",
    "when the trace is small , one may argue that it can be neglected .",
    "i , however , claim that it can be neglected only if it is small compare to the trace which a single particle with the same coupling being at the same place would leave .",
    "hence , the remaining task is the comparison between the trace left in the transmission channel in the `` counterfactual '' communication protocols @xcite and the trace left by a single particle passing through the channel . in the next section",
    "i will analyze the minimal trace left by a single particle being in a transmission channel and the comparison will be made in the following sections .",
    "in the framework of standard quantum mechanics there is no rigorous way to decide if statement ( 3 ) holds , that is : whether or not the particle was present in the transmission channel . in a two - slit experiment",
    "it is not clear whether the particle was in a particular slit .",
    "if a particle starts on one side of a plate with two slits and it is found later on the other side , we do not know if the particle was in the two slits together , or in one of them . however , we firmly believe that it can not be that the particle was not present in both .    ) . , width=272 ]    consider first a single - path transmission channel with a single particle in the form of a single localized wave packet .",
    "the wave packet passes from alice to bob , see fig .",
    "let us model the interaction of the particle with the transmission channel as von neumann measurement with a gaussian probe .",
    "the initial wave function of the pointer is @xmath42 when a particle is present in the transmission channel , the interaction shifts @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the state of the measuring device after the interaction is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is orthogonal to the initial pointer state and @xmath47 .    how to quantify the strength of the trace ?",
    "one option is to consider the probability of detecting the change in the state of the channel in an idealized experiment .",
    "the probability equals @xmath48 .",
    "another option is just to use the shift of the pointer via the parameter @xmath49 .    for a strong trace",
    ", the probability criterion does not represent the trace well : it remains almost 1 for @xmath50 and also for @xmath51 . in practice , however , it is plausible that in a realistic experiment , when in addition to the quantum uncertainty of the pointer there is an uncertainty of the grid on which we read the pointer , only very large @xmath49 can be observed .    for a small value of @xmath49 ,",
    "the probability of detection is proportional to the square of this parameter .",
    "the transmission of two particles doubles the shift , but increases the probability of detection by a factor of 4 .",
    "the linear response seems to be a better representation of the trace .",
    "consider now a single particle passing through the transmission channel which consists of @xmath2 identical paths as above .",
    "the quantum state of the particle is an equal weight superposition of wave packets in all paths , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 signifies the wave packet of the particle inside path @xmath54 in the transmission channel , see fig .",
    "after the particle passes the transmission channel , the state of the particle and the pointers representing the transmission channel becomes @xmath55 the probability to detect the particle in the transmission channel is the probability to find one of the states @xmath56 .",
    "it is @xmath48 as in the case of the single - path channel .",
    "the sum of the expectation values of the shifts of the @xmath57s is also the same , @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to consider the post - selection measurement of the state of the particle made by bob .",
    "let bob select the undisturbed state @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to detection of the particle by bob s detector in fig .",
    "10 . for a good , low noise channel",
    ", the probability to find this state is very close to 1 .",
    "the state of the transmission channel then becomes @xmath60 at this stage , the probability to find one of the states @xmath56 is reduced dramatically .",
    "this is because the failure of post - selection by bob implies that the probability to find one of the states @xmath56 is 1 . for small @xmath61 , the probability to detect the particle in the transmission channel after the successful post - selection is approximately @xmath62 .",
    "it is interesting that the post - selection of the particle state does not change the expectation value of the sum of the pointer variables @xmath63 .",
    "one way to see this is to note that @xmath63 is proportional to the weak value @xcite of the sum of the projections on all parts of the channel which equals 1 because the initial state is the eigenstate of the sum of the projections with the eigenvalue 1 @xcite . for describing the magnitude of the trace ,",
    "the directions of the shifts are not important .",
    "so the relevant parameter is @xmath64 .",
    "we have found a lower bound , @xmath65 .",
    "i analyse next the trace left in the transmission channel in communication protocols discussed above . all protocols are based on interference , therefore , when they work properly , only a small trace can be left .",
    "i use the same model : in every path of the transmission channel , the presence of the particle shifts the gaussian pointer , see ( [ a ] ) .",
    "i assume that the coupling is weak : @xmath66 , and consequently , @xmath67 . for simplicity ,",
    "i consider the trace created by particles moving from alice to bob and disregard the trace created on the way from bob to alice .",
    "then , the example described in fig .  1 , is identical to that of fig .",
    "and the trace in the communication channel is the shift @xmath44 of the pointer and the probability to discover the presence of the particle by observing the trace , is @xmath48 . in the communication of the bit 0 using ifm , fig .  2 , and in the protocol with hwps , fig .",
    "3 the trace is of the same order of magnitude .    in the ifm communication of the bit 1 , see fig",
    ".  2 , after the interaction with the transmission channel , the state of the particle and the pointer is @xmath68.\\ ] ] if the particle is absorbed by bob , the trace in the channel is exactly as in the single - path channel of section [ presence ] : shift by @xmath44 and the probability to find the trace is @xmath48 .",
    "if the particle is detected by alice , then there is no trace in the transmission channel . the wave packet `` tagged '' by an orthogonal state of the channel",
    ", @xmath46 can not reach alice .",
    "now i consider the ifm experiment with the chain of the interferometers , fig .  4 ,",
    "starting with the communication of bit 0 , the case in which bob leaves the interferometers undisturbed .",
    "the exact expressions are complicated , but for weak coupling , only the first order contibution in @xmath61 is significant . neglecting the coupling to the channel , we obtain from ( [ n - steps ] ) the state of the particle in the @xmath5th interferometer @xmath69 the wave packet @xmath37 , `` tagged '' at the @xmath5th interferometer by the state @xmath70 in the transmission channel , interferes only with itself and reaches detectors in the state @xmath71 in this experiment , the particle ends up in detector @xmath1 ( state @xmath37 ) with the probability close to 1 .",
    "the state of the transmission channel then is @xmath72 with normalization @xmath73 close to 1 .",
    "therefore , the probability to detect the particle in the transmission channel , i.e. , to find at least one of the states @xmath70 , @xmath74 is much larger than the minimal probability to find a single particle present in this multiple - path channel , which can be as low as @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the case of the bit 0 is definitely not a `` counterfactual '' communication .",
    "this can also be seen by calculating the pointers shifts .",
    "these shifts are proportional to the expectation value of the projection on the paths of the transmission channel .",
    "the shift in path @xmath5 is @xmath75 and the sum of all shifts , @xmath76 , is much larger than @xmath44 , the standard for the presence of a single particle in the channel .",
    "the situation is different for communication of bit 1 , when bob blocks the paths of the interferometers , fig .",
    "4b . due to zeno effect , the probability of absorbtion by bob is negligible .",

    "it is , therefore , a counterfactual communication for bit value 1 .",
    "let us turn now to the case of nested interferometers , fig .",
    "the case which is particularly interesting is described in fig .",
    "bob does not put the shutter in , and detector @xmath0 clicks .",
    "alice knows that the bit is 0 , and naively , it seems to be a counterfactual communication since the particle `` could not pass through the transmission channel '' .",
    "indeed , the wave packet entering the nested interferometer does not reach detector @xmath0 .",
    "the interferometer was defined only by demanding destructive interferences in particular situations . to make quantitative predictions",
    ", we have to specify the beam splitters of the interferometer . in a possible implementation of the interferometer @xcite , the first two beam splitters transform the localized wave packet entering the interferometer into a superposition : @xmath77 where states @xmath53 signifies a wave packet entering detector @xmath78 , ( @xmath54=1,2,3 ) .",
    "it is is easy to see that these rules ensure the required destructive interferences .",
    "after the interaction , the joint state of the particle and the channel is @xmath79.\\ ] ] from ( [ abc2 ] ) we see that the detection of the particle in detector @xmath0 post - selects the state @xmath80 therefore , the state of the channel after the post - selection is @xmath81 this is exactly the same state of the channel as in the case that a single particle passed through it , see ( [ a ] ) .",
    "thus , contrary to the naive expectation , the scheme with nested interferometers does not provide counterfactual communication @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to analyze the trace left in the  direct counterfactual quantum communication \" .",
    "the case of bit 1 , fig .",
    "6a , is simple .",
    "the trace in the communication channel is correlated with the final location of the particle . if it is absorbed by alice , which happens with a probability close to 1 and",
    "corresponds to the proper operation of the protocol , the trace is zero .",
    "the wave packets `` tagged '' by orthogonal states of the channel , @xmath82 , can not reach alice .",
    "the trace is present only if the particle is absorbed by one of the bob s shutters which happens with vanishing probability .",
    "this is a counterfactual communication protocol for bit 1 .",
    "the more interesting case is that of bit 0 , when bob leaves the interferometer undisturbed , fig .",
    "we assume that the interaction with the channel is small , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , so only the first order in @xmath61 should be considered .    the amplitude of the wave packet of the particle in the @xmath5th path of @xmath19th chain of the inner interferometers @xmath85 , is @xmath86 a particle present in the path @xmath85 changes the state of the corresponding pointer according to ( [ a ] ) : @xmath87 the wave packet @xmath88 `` tagged '' by the orthogonal state @xmath82 interferes only with itself and leaves the inner chain in the state , see ( [ n - n steps ] ) : @xmath89 state @xmath37 is lost and the state @xmath10 of the last inner interferometer of the chain @xmath19 enters from the right the remaining @xmath90 large interferometers .",
    "the transformation of this state ( which is named @xmath37 in the following equation ) in the remaining interferometers is : @xmath91 where `` ... '' signifies the wave packets which do not reach the detectors .    in the protocol",
    ", the particle is found with probability close to 1 by detector @xmath0 .",
    "after the detection of the particle , the amplitude of the term @xmath82 corresponding to detection of the particle in the path @xmath85 can be found by collecting the factors in ( 23 - 26 ) .",
    "it is @xmath92 as explained in section [ directcf ] , the protocol works properly if @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 and the probability that one of the orthogonal states @xmath82 will be found in the transmission channel is , approximately , @xmath95    the number of paths in the channel is @xmath96 .",
    "we have seen that a single particle present in such a channel can be found with probability as low as @xmath97 which is smaller than the probability of detection of the particle in the protocol by a factor of approximately @xmath98 . since the protocol works well only when",
    "@xmath99 , the trace in the protocol is larger than the trace of a single particle passing through the channel .",
    "another criterion of counterfactuality is the sum of displacements of the pointers in all paths of the channel , the standard for which is @xmath44",
    ". it can be found by calculating the absolute values of weak values of all projections : @xmath100 with pre- and post - selection specified by the protocol .",
    "the scalar product in the denominator of the weak value is close to 1 since the probability of the post - selection is close to 1 .",
    "the amplitude of the forward evolving state at path @xmath85 is given by ( [ ampnm ] ) and , similarly , the amplitude of the backward evolving state is @xmath101 thus , the weak value of the projection on the path @xmath85 can be approximated as @xmath102 and the sum of all shifts of pointers is @xmath103 since @xmath99 , the trace in the protocol is much larger than the standard of the trace of a single particle present in such multiple - path channel .",
    "let us turn to the `` direct quantum communication with almost invisible photons '' protocol @xcite .",
    "when bob transmits 0 , i.e. does nothing , fig .",
    "8a , the amplitude in the path @xmath85 is @xmath104 the wave packet @xmath88 , `` tagged '' by the orthogonal state @xmath82 , interferes only with itself and it leaves the inner chain in the state @xmath105 the state @xmath37 is lost and the state @xmath10 of the last inner interferometer of the chain @xmath19 enters from the right the remaining @xmath90 large interferometers . using the fact that `` tagging '' takes place only for odd @xmath19 , and that the number of the large interferometers is odd ( @xmath14 , the number of beam splitters is even ) , and that after every second beam splitter the wave function repeats itself , we can conclude that the wave packet leaves the last beam splitter of the last inner chain with the same amplitude .",
    "the wave packet entering the last beam splitter of the large interferometers transforms into @xmath106    in the protocol , the particle is detected with probability close to 1 by detector @xmath0 which detects the state @xmath10 .",
    "thus , after detection of the particle , the amplitude of the term @xmath82 corresponding to the detection of the particle in the path @xmath85 can be found by collecting factors from ( [ inv1]-[inv3 ] ) and a factor @xmath61 due to the interaction : @xmath107 this expression holds only for odd @xmath19 , the amplitude in the paths with even @xmath19 vanishes . summing the probabilities of finding the record the particle leaves in all the paths , i.e. summing on odd @xmath19s up to @xmath12 and on integers @xmath5 up to @xmath13 , we obtain the probability of detection of the particle : @xmath108    a single particle passing through this transmission channel can be found with probability of order @xmath109 .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath110 , it can be smaller or larger than ( [ ampnmapprox ] ) , so we can not yet decide on the counterfactuality of the protocol .",
    "compare now the sum of the pointer shifts in the channel .",
    "it can be found by calculating the absolute values of weak values of all projections : @xmath100 with the pre- and post - selection specified by the protocol . in this case , the pre- and post - selected states are identical , so the weak values are expectation values : @xmath111 and @xmath112    the sum of the pointer shifts when there is one particle in the transmission channel equals @xmath44 , so the ratio @xmath110 tells us when the sum of displacements in the protocol ( [ wvproj0 ] ) is smaller or larger than that of a single particle present in the channel .",
    "we can see that the criterion of the pointer shifts is in agreement with the criterion of the probability of detection .",
    "let us now repeat the analysis for the case of bit 1 , when bob puts hwps in every inner interferometer . now",
    "the amplitude in the path @xmath85 is @xmath113    the wave packet @xmath88 , can be `` tagged '' by the orthogonal state @xmath82 only for odd @xmath5 .",
    "thus , due to the presence of the hwps , the wave packet comes back unchanged every second beam splitter .",
    "it leaves the chain of the inner interferometers in the state @xmath114 state @xmath37 is lost , and the state @xmath10 of the last inner interferometer of the chain @xmath19 enters from the right the remaining @xmath90 large interferometers . in the chain of the large interferometers it performs usual evolution ( [ n - steps ] ) and ends up in the state @xmath115    in the protocol , the particle is detected with probability close to 1 by detector @xmath1 which detects the state @xmath37 .",
    "thus , after the detection of the particle , the amplitude of the term @xmath82 corresponding to the detection of the particle in the path @xmath85 can be found by collecting factors from ( [ inv4]-[inv6 ] ) and the factor @xmath61 due to the interaction : @xmath116 this expression holds only for odd @xmath5 , the amplitude in the paths with even @xmath5 , vanishes . summing the probabilities of finding the record the particle leaves in all the paths , we obtain the probability of detection of the particle : @xmath117    again , as in the case of bit 0",
    ", the ratio @xmath110 tells us if it is larger or smaller than the minimal probability of detection in case of a single particle present in the transmission channel .",
    "however , the dependence is opposite : if for bit 0 the probability of detection in the protocol was smaller than single - particle standard , for bit 1 it will be larger , and vice versa .",
    "the pointer shifts criterion of counterfactuality is in agreement with these results .",
    "the sum of pointers shifts in all paths of the channel is proportional to the sum of the weak values of all projections : @xmath100 .",
    "also in this case , the pre- and post - selected states are identical and the weak values are expectation values : @xmath118 and @xmath119 the ratio @xmath110 tells us when the sum of displacements in the protocol ( [ wvproj1 ] ) is smaller or larger than that of a single particle . if it is smaller for bit 1 , it is larger for bit 0 , and vice versa .",
    "one of the motivations for `` counterfactual '' protocols , in which no particles are present in the transmission channel , is that it is secure against eve who is trying to eavesdrop the communication : she has no particles to look at @xcite .",
    "the obvious cryptographic weakness of the protocols with shutters which are 100% counterfactual is that eve can use an active attack detecting the presence of the shutters .",
    "moreover , the shutter can be detected by eve in a counterfactual way @xcite , and recently there has been a claim of a very efficient attack of this kind @xcite .",
    "if eve uses an active attack , probing bob s bit by sending her particles , the counterfactuality property does not help .",
    "so , for the analysis of counterfactuality we should only consider passive attacks in which eve `` eavesdrops '' , i.e. measures the presence of the particle in the transmission channel . under this condition ,",
    "the counterfactual protocols with shutters are secure .",
    "consider the following counterfactual key distribution protocol .",
    "there are two identical chains of interferometers as in fig .",
    "one of the chains is defined as bit 0 , and the other as bit 1 . on each run of the protocol",
    ", alice randomly sends a single particle through one of the interferometers and bob randomly chooses one of the interferometers and places the shutters in all of its paths .",
    "every time alice detects the particle in detector @xmath0 of one of the interferometers , she makes a public announcement .",
    "detector @xmath0 can click only if alice and bob chose the same interferometer , i.e. they chose the same bit .",
    "this creates a common key .",
    "the multiple shutters bob placed represent the weak point of the protocol due to the reason above , although we can improve it using detectors instead of shutters and telling alice to send particles not every time , but only at some random times ( using ideas of @xcite ) .",
    "anyway , we made a postulate here that eve only performs some ( weak ) nondemolition measurements of the presence of the particle running in the interferometer .",
    "let us see if eve can get some information about the key in this way .",
    "if eve detects the particle in one of the interferometers , it can not be the one which generates a correct bit in the key .",
    "for a correct bit generation event , alice and bob have to choose the same interferometer .",
    "eve can detect the particle only if it is present , i.e. , it has to be chosen by alice .",
    "if bob also chooses this interferometer , then after detection by eve , the particle has to be absorbed by bob , so it will not reach alice .",
    "only if the interferometer is not chosen by bob , the particle seen by eve in the nondemolition measurement can reach alice , and there is a nonzero probability that the detector @xmath0 will click and thus alice will declare generation of a bit in the key . but this will be an error bit , since bob has chosen the other interferometer .",
    "eve introduces errors , and the only information she gets is about these error bits .",
    "let us turn to the `` direct counterfactual quantum communication '' protocol .",
    "when bob places the shutters , fig .",
    "6a , eve can not get information about the correct bit because eve s detection causes the loss of the particle .",
    "( it is not surprising , since in this case the protocol is counterfactual . )",
    "if the bit is 0 , and the interferometer is free , fig .  6b ,",
    "eve s detection will not necessarily lead to the loss of the particle .",
    "detection of the particle by eve in the last chain of inner interferometers will lead to part of its wave packet to enter the last beam splitter from the right , so most probably it will create an error : @xmath1 clicks , but bob s bit is 0 .",
    "however , eve s detection of the particle in any of the first @xmath120 chains of inner interferometers will lead to part of the particle wave packet to enter the last beam splitter from the left side , so most probably @xmath0 will click , corresponding to a successful transmission of the correct bit .",
    "thus , sometimes , eve gets a reliable information about the transmitted bit .",
    "eve , who eavesdrops only by observing the original particle of the communication protocol , can not learn any correct bit of real counterfactual protocols with shutters which transmit bit 1 , but she does learn some correct bits in `` counterfactual '' communication protocols of bit 0 .",
    "this provides another argument why such protocols should not be named counterfactual .",
    "it seems that bohmian mechanics @xcite , which postulates that every particle has a trajectory , should provide the ultimate answer regarding the counterfactuality of a protocol .",
    "there are unambiguous answers to criteria ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of sec .",
    "[ criteria ] : either the bohmian trajectory passes through the transmission channel , or it does not .",
    "however , the fact that the bohmian trajectory does not pass through the transmission channel does not tell us that eve , who has an access to this channel , can not get some information about this communication .    for completeness of the counterfactuality analysis",
    ", i will consider the following technical question .",
    "is the bohmian trajectory present in the transmission channel of the protocols discussed in this paper ?",
    "bohmian position of a particle can not be in a place where the ( forward evolving ) wave function vanishes .",
    "therefore , the successful ifms of the presence of an opaque object , described in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "4b , are counterfactual according to the bohmian trajectory criterion .",
    "moreover , the ifm of the absence of an opaque object , fig .",
    "5a , is counterfactual too .",
    "direct counterfactual communication @xcite , as its predecessor @xcite and their variation presented in fig .  6 , are counterfactual . in all these protocols",
    "there is no continuous path with non - vanishing wave function between the source and the detector the particle reached .     when the shutter is present .",
    "thus , if detector @xmath1 clicks , we know that path @xmath121 is free .",
    "although naively , the particle reaching @xmath1 can not pass through the inner interfereometer , the bohmian trajectory of the particle ( solid line ) does pass through @xmath121 .",
    ", width=272 ]    in the `` direct quantum communication with almost invisible photons '' @xcite , see fig .",
    "8 , the probability that the bohmian particle will pass through the transmission channel can be found from the maximal amplitude in the paths passing through the channel . for bit 0",
    ", the amplitude is given by ( [ inv1 ] ) , and therefore , the maximum probability is approximately @xmath31 . for bit 1",
    ", the amplitude is given by ( [ inv4 ] ) , and the maximum probability is approximately @xmath122 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath14 and @xmath2 , the probability that the communication is counterfactual is close to 1 for both bit values .",
    "however , it should be mentioned , that in most cases when the communication is not counterfactual , the bohmian particle crosses the transmission channel , not once , but many times .",
    "given equal probability for bit values , the expectation value of the number of crosses of the transmission channel by the bohmian particle can be obtained from the sum of the probabilities on all paths .",
    "the amplitudes are given by ( [ inv1 ] ) and ( [ inv4 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the expectation value of the number of crosses is , approximately , @xmath123 , and it can not be much less than 1 for any choice of @xmath14 and @xmath2 .    note that in the `` direct counterfactual communication protocol '' _ experiment _ @xcite , the expectation value of the number of crosses of the transmission channel is also of order 1 , but all these events happen when the particle is lost , and these cases are discarded according to the protocol .     or @xmath1 possible .",
    "only empty wave passes through the transmission channel when alice s detector clicks .",
    ", width=272 ]    i mentioned above that the protocol presented in fig .",
    "5a , which demonstrates the absence of an object in the apparently interaction - free manner , is counterfactual according to bohm .",
    "it is interesting that a slight modification of this setup , similar to the experiment actually performed @xcite , is _ not _ counterfactual .",
    "consider a setup presented in fig .",
    "11 . a straightforward calculations of bohmian trajectories ( similar to that of bell @xcite , or in a simplified way @xcite ) show that _ all _ particles detected by @xmath1 passed through arm @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , the experiment @xcite indicated the presence of the weak trace in @xmath121 , but it had nothing to do with the presence of the bohmian trajectory there .",
    "the weak trace appeared also in @xmath124 and @xmath125 where the bohmian particle was not present .",
    "empty waves cause observable difference when they `` catch '' bohmian particles .",
    "this allows a very simple communication protocol which is counterfactual according to bohmian criterion , see fig .",
    "particles are sent through a mzi without a second beam splitter at particular times .",
    "one of the mirrors is in bob s place and he has two options for placing it , such that the wave bouncing off the mirror will end up in detector @xmath0 or @xmath1 on alice s side .",
    "the wave packet going through another arm ends at detector @xmath126 on bob s side .",
    "if the particle does not reach @xmath126 , bob knows that it reaches alice and that  it he has chosen the detector which will detect the particle .",
    "every time @xmath0 or @xmath1 clicks the bohmian particle does not pass through bob s place .",
    "only an empty wave was directed by bob s mirror .",
    "indeed , the wave packets overlap at point @xmath127 or @xmath128 and the bohmian particle must `` change hands '' in the overlap , so bohmian particles reaching alice s detectors never cross communication channel .",
    "probably the majority would not consider the communication protocol described in fig .",
    "12 as counterfactual .",
    "according to wheeler s common sense argument @xcite , the particle reaching alice could come only through bob s site .",
    "this example , and englert et al .",
    "setup @xcite , in which a strong trace ( observed at a later time ) is left in a place where the bohmian particle was not present , explain why the bohmian criterion of counterfactuality does not agree with the intuition of most physicists .",
    "the standard quantum formalism , in contrast to bohmian mechanics , does not specify the position of a quantum particle .",
    "thus , it does not provide an unambiguous answer to the question : is a particular communication protocol counterfactual ?",
    "i.e. : was the particle present in the transmission channel ? in this paper",
    "i analyzed an approach to answering this question based on the weak trace the particle leaves in the channel .",
    "i compared the trace left in the channel in recently proposed protocols claimed to be counterfactual with the trace in the protocol constructed to transmit a single particle in the same channel .    in the analysis , i considered two criteria for comparing the traces .",
    "first , the probability of finding a conclusive evidence for the presence of the particle , and second , the expectation value of the sum of total shifts of some variables of the channel .    the question of counterfactuality of the protocols is considered in cases the protocols work properly , i.e. when the particle is detected by the right detector .",
    "it means that the particle is pre- and post - selected .",

    "nothing changes in the transmission channel and therefore there is zero probability to detect the particle in the transmission channel .",
    "passive eavesdropping provides no information about the transmitted bit .    however , the protocol is not counterfactual for the bit value 0 .",
    "it is true that by increasing the number of paths in the channel , the probability of finding a conclusive evidence of the presence of the particle reduces , but increasing the number of paths also reduces the probability to find a single quantum particle when it passes the channel .",
    "the probability to find the presence of the particle in the transmission channel in the event of successful operation of the protocol is larger than the probability to detect a particle successfully passing through this channel .",
