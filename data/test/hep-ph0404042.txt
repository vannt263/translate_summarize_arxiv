    "<S> solar neutrino physics enters a stage of precision measurements . in this connection we present a precise analytic description of the neutrino conversion in the context of lma msw solution of the solar neutrino problem . using the adiabatic perturbation theory we derive an analytic formula for the @xmath0 survival probability which takes into account the non - adiabatic corrections and the regeneration effect inside the earth . </S>",
    "<S> the probability is averaged over the neutrino production region . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the non - adiabatic corrections are of the order @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> using the formula for the earth regeneration effect we discuss features of the zenith angle dependence of the @xmath0 flux . in particular , we show that effects of small structures at the surface of the earth can be important .     </S>",
