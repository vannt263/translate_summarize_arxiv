    "recent advancements in observations and modeling created a picture of a sunspot as being very dynamic and complex magnetic structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a closer look at the dark sunspot umbra using photospheric spectral lines revealed detailed structure of bright and nearly circular small intensity patches called umbral dots ( uds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "magnetic fields in uds are weaker than in their darker surroundings and uds show plasma up - flows of a few hundred m s@xmath0 . according to realistic 3d simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) uds result from magneto - convection in sunspot umbra , and represent narrow convective up - flow plumes with adjacent down - flows , which become almost field - free near the surface layer .",
    "the umbra appears much more dynamic when observed using chromospheric spectral lines .",
    "based on recent high resolution observations it has been suggested that the sunspot s umbra may be finely structured , and consists of hot and cool plasma elements intermixed at sub - arcsecond scales @xcite . the well - known 3-min sunspot oscillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) often lead to the appearance of bright umbral flashes ( ufs ) , which are emissions in the core of chromospheric lines caused by hot shocked plasma @xcite and were reported to display a filamentary structure @xcite .",
    "later studies also found evidence for a two - component structure of the umbra .",
    "transient jet - like structures were recently reported by seen in the ca ii h images of the sunspot umbrae , which they called umbral microjets .",
    "the microjets appear to be aligned with the umbral field , and no one - to - one correspondence between the microjets and the umbral dots was found .",
    "@xcite described small - scale , periodic , jet - like features in the chromosphere above sunspots , which result from long - period waves leaking into the chromosphere along inclined sunspot fields .    in this paper",
    "we present first detailed observations of fine - scale chromospheric phenomena in sunspot s umbra using h@xmath1 imaging spectroscopy data obtained with the new solar telescope ( nst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that operates in big bear solar observatory .",
    "the data allowed us to fully resolve ubiquitous dynamic umbral h@xmath1 jet - like features and measure their general properties .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in figures [ xtplot ] and [ xtplot_inset ] we show time variations of chromospheric intensity made along the cuts indicated in figure [ sunspot ] by two line segments .",
    "the cuts were made along the axis of spikes and the width of the slit was 0.32  mm ( 15  pixels=0.43 ) . the repeating dark half - parabola feature seen above 1  mm is a propagating front of penumbral waves that are excited at the umbra - penumbra boundary ( x=1  mm ) and travel toward the outer bounds of the penumbra .",
    "the umbral spikes seen here as the dense and short features visible below @xmath2  mm and between @xmath3 and @xmath4  min ( figure [ xtplot_inset ] ) with the lifetime of about 3  min .",
    "the tip of the spikes appears to be rising up with velocities of about 4 - 5  km s@xmath0 , which is expected to reflect local sound speed and is in the range of the reported velocities associated with oscilaltions and shock formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the temporal resolution of the data did not allow us to make a more detailed conclusions about their dynamics .",
    "after @xmath5  min they briefly appear nearly every 3  min approximately at the moments of the minimum in the white curve ( i.e , at @xmath6 and @xmath7  min ) . in general , the data set gives an impression that the spikes tend to re - occur at the same locations at fairly regular time intervals ; however , their parameters vary , possibly reflecting the strength of local oscillations .",
    "the lower plot in figure [ xtplot ] shows similar features and behavior except that it was made using h@xmath1 - 0.06  nm data .",
    "the penumbral waves are still present , although their front is less dense and narrower .",
    "the same is true about the umbral spikes , which are only weakly seen in the plot ( i.e , at @xmath8 , and @xmath9  min ) .",
    "= 3truein    it is worth noting that each occurrence of the spikes in the center of the penumbra seems to be correlated in time with the onset of a new penumbral wave : the wave begins when spikes are at the peak of their development and is best evidenced in the lower panel of figure [ xtplot ] between t=63  min and t=81  min .",
    "the spikes are visible under the white curve and the middle of their life time occurs when the white curve is in the maximum . at the same moment of time",
    "a dark front , representing penumbral waves , begins to propagate above the white curve .",
    "this correlation may indicate that the spikes and the running penumbral waves are triggered and powered by the same process that appear to be coherent on scales comparable to the size of a sunspot , such as sunspot oscillations .",
    "we summarize our findings as follows . high resolution nst observations of solar chromosphere using the h@xmath1 spectral line revealed the existence of dynamic spike - like chromospheric structures inside sunspot s umbra , which we called umbral spikes .",
    "the spikes are on average about 0.1  mm wide , their height does not exceed 1  mm .",
    "they are mainly vertical with a slight tendency to fan out closer to the periphery of the umbra .",
    "since umbral fields show similar inclination distribution we suggest that the umbral spikes are aligned with the umbral magnetic fields .",
    "the spikes show a nearly uniform distribution over the umbra with a tendency to be more concentrated in its darkest parts occupied by strongest fields in the umbra , while uds are considered to be field - free magneto - convection features .",
    "thus , our finding seem to indicate that the umbral spikes may be co - spatial with strong magnetic flux concentrations rather than with the weaker magnetic fields above uds .",
    "these first detailed observations of umbral spikes presented here suggest that they are a wave phenomena and result from sunspot oscillations .",
    "observed transient jet - like structures in ca ii h images of sunspot umbrae , which they called umbral microjets .",
    "the authors speculated that the microjets , which are shorter than 1  mm and not wider than 0.3 , may be either upflow jets driven by the pressure gradient above the photospheric uds or they may be caused by reconnection of hypothetical opposite polarity fields that might exist around large uds .",
    "although the h@xmath1 spikes and the microjets are of a comparable size , the lifetime of spikes appears to be longer ( 2 - 3  min ) than that of the microjets ( 50  s ) .",
    "while a possible relationship between them has yet to be established , it seems that the two phenomena are different and the scenarios presented in may not be able to explain the spikes , since the latter show a preference to be more frequent in the darkest cores of the umbra , dominated by strong fields and void of large and bright uds .",
    "@xcite described dynamic fibrils ( df ) observed in the chromosphere above a sunspot .",
    "their _ xt _ plot generated from a series of the h@xmath1 line center images ( see fig .",
    "3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows the presence of parabolic intensity features , which were interpreted by these authors as being very short jet - like features precisely above the umbra . at the same time",
    "individual umbral spikes where not resolved in their data and only diffuse , low contrast dark specks can be distinguished inside the umbra in the corresponding h@xmath1 images .",
    "the umbral spikes and the dfs may be the same wave phenomenon while their differences in appearance are caused by the fine scaled structures in magnetic fields , viewing angle as well as the resolution of the data .",
    "@xcite studied wave propagation in different magnetic configurations .",
    "they found that peaks of power of 3  min oscillations and high amplitudes of vertical velocities ( 5 - 8  km / s ) are located above strong photospheric flux concentrations or , in other words , inside vertical flux tubes .",
    "they also found that rising and falling jets , which form as a result of the oscillations , have their axis aligned with the magnetic axis of field concentrations .",
    "general appearance of the simulated jets and their oscillatory motions are strikingly similar to those of the spikes ( see fig . 25 in @xcite and fig . 1 in this paper ) , although the simulated jets appear to be , on average , more extended ( 0.5 - 6.0  mm ) , longer living ( 2 - 5  min ) and show higher velocities ( 10 - 40  km / s ) .",
    "thus one possible interpretation of the observed phenomena is the penetration of photospheric oscillations into the chromosphere along thin and vertical magnetic flux tubes .    using spectropolarimetric observations",
    "@xcite suggested the existence of an unresolved active component with upward directed velocities .",
    "more precisely , the anomalous polarization profiles could only be explained by emission from an unresolved mixture of upward propagating shock and a cool slowly downflowing surroundings .",
    "later @xcite specified that the active component is present through out the entire oscillation cycle .",
    "they also inferred that the shock waves propagate into the umbra inside channels of subarcsecond width , which could be the flux tubes discussed above .",
    "finally , @xcite presented high resolution _ hinode _ data on ufs concluding that ufs show fine filamented structure .",
    "we argue that the 0.1 wide umbral spikes may be the unresolved active component of the sunspots umbra discussed above .",
    "they represent finely structured shocked plasma showing up- and down - flows of order of 5 - 7 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the data seem to suggest that the spikes are associated with interiors of strong flux tubes , thus conforming the idea about the existence of narrow channels conduct photospheric oscillations into the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested that the fine structure of ufs is related to the sunspot dynamic fibrils .",
    "the new data presented here shows that the dark filaments reported inside the uf area are the vertical umbral spikes projected on the otherwise uniform and unstructured ufs .",
