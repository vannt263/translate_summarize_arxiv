    "with the notable exception of literally a handful of papers ( e.g. , wilson 1983 ; abbott and schaeffer 1986 , sugiyama and gouda 1992 ) , most cosmologists have focused on microwave fluctuations in a flat universe .",
    "concordance of high values for the hubble parameter ( jacoby et al .",
    "1992 ) with conservative lower bounds on the age of the universe and numerous dynamical measures suggesting that @xmath6 ( see white 1992 for review ) have encouraged us to explore open - universe models in more detail .",
    "open universes differ from flat universes in two distinct ways : ( 1 ) the geometry of an open universe is hyperbolic rather than flat ; and ( 2 ) density fluctuations in an open universe stop growing at redshifts much smaller than @xmath7 . in this lecture , i will discuss how these two differences lead to a distinctive microwave background signature for open - universe models .",
    "the predictions of a cosmological model depend not only on its assumptions about the global geometry of the universe , but also on its assumptions about the mechanism for generating density fluctuations and its assumptions about the nature of the dark matter .",
    "density fluctuations can be divided into two broad categories : curvature fluctuations and equation - of - state fluctuations .",
    "these two categories are generalizations of the usual division of fluctuations in models composed of only baryons and photons into adiabatic fluctuations and isothermal fluctuations .",
    "curvature fluctuations are fluctuations in the total density of matter and assume no variation in the local properties of matter",
    ". in inflationary models , quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field develop into curvature fluctuations and the study of the evolution of these fluctuations has dominated theoretical cosmology for the past decade .",
    "equation - of - state fluctuations are fluctuations that are produced through local variations in the properties of matter . in isothermal baryon models , variations in the ratio of baryons to photons ( entropy fluctuations )",
    "are the equation - of - state fluctuations that produce density fluctuations . in topological - defect models , such as cosmic strings and textures ,",
    "the stress - energy in the defects are the source of the variations in equations of state that lead to density fluctuations .",
    "if there was a primordial magnetic field , it would produce density fluctuations through variations in the ratio of magnetic - field energy to the local density .",
    "the difference between these two types of fluctuations are apparent when we consider the evolution equation for potential fluctuations in a flat matter - dominated universe : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the gravitational potential , @xmath10 is the scale factor , prime denotes derivatives with respect to conformal time and @xmath11 depends on variations in the local equation of state . in a universe filled only with matter or in a universe with only adiabatic fluctuations , @xmath12 . in models with curvature fluctuations , @xmath12 , and @xmath9 has an initial non - zero value at the start of the friedman - robertson - walker phase .",
    "thus , these models start the frw phase with variations in the local curvature . in models with equation - of - state fluctuations ,",
    "@xmath11 is non - zero and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , in these models , the universe starts its frw phase without any variations in curvature .",
    "hence , these models are also sometimes called isocurvature models .",
    "we will first consider the evolution of curvature fluctuations in an open universe . in an open universe , the evolution equation for potential fluctuations",
    "is modified ( kodama and sasaki 1984 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "this modification implies that at late times , potential fluctuation in an open universe decay .",
    "the fluctuation decay has two significant effects on the microwave background : ( a ) the decaying potential fluctuations are an additional source of cmb fluctuations and ( b ) since we normalize theories to observations of structure at the current redshift , this decay implies that open universe models started out with larger potential fluctuations at recombination .",
    "since both of these factors increase the predicted level of cmb fluctuations , many cosmologists expected that open universe models were inconsistent with the level of fluctuations observed by cobe .",
    "however , the amplitude of fluctuations decreases for larger hubble constants , and geometric effects lower the level of fluctuations predicted by open - universe models on the largest scales , so these models can be compatible with cobe .    in a flat universe , an angular cone of radius @xmath16 in radius",
    "subtends a surface of comoving radius 300 mpc at the surface of last scatter .",
    "thus , if the universe is flat , then cobe is probing density fluctuations on this scale .",
    "however , in an open universe , the same cone subtends a surface of somewhat larger radius , @xmath17 mpc .",
    "since density fluctuations decrease with scale in almost all proposed cosmological models , this implies that this geometric effect suppresses cmb fluctuations .",
    "kamionkowski and spergel ( 1993 ) recently completed an analysis of cmb fluctuations in an open universe that included both geometric and evolutionary effects .",
    "this analysis assumed that the universe was cold - dark - matter dominated and the spectrum of density fluctuations was scale - invariant .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show that the cobe predictions were insensitive to the details of how we extrapolated the scale - invariant spectrum to scales larger than the curvature scale .",
    "figure 1 shows three different procedures for extrapolating a scale - invariant power spectrum beyond the curvature scale .",
    "figure 2 shows the predicted amplitude of the cmb multipoles for these three very different power law extrapolations . since the cobe experiment is sensitive mostly to the amplitude of mass fluctuations on the 1000-mpc scale , it is not very sensitive to the variations in the form of the power spectrum on superhorizon scales .",
    "the differences between these different extrapolations would be swamped by cosmic variance .",
    "the dotted line is the multipole spectrum in a flat string - dominated universe .",
    "[ fig : multipole spectrum ]    for models with scale - invariant fluctuations , the current observations place restrictive limits on the allowed value of @xmath0 .",
    "observations of large - scale structure ( vogeley et al .",
    "1992 ; fisher et al . 1993 ; baugh and efstathiou 1993 ) imply that @xmath5 for a cdm - dominated universe .",
    "estimates of globular - cluster ages imply that the age of the universe should exceed 13 gyr ( deliyannis et al .",
    "1989 ) . combining these constraints with cobe normalization ( smoot et al . 1992 ) and the requirement that amplitude of density fluctuations on the @xmath18 mpc scale exceeds 0.5 restricts these models to a narrow region of parameter space .",
    "figure 3 shows that these three constraints can only be satisfied for @xmath19 and that large values of @xmath0 require that the hubble constant is less than 50 km / s / mpc .",
    "unfortunately , the cobe observations alone can not determine the value of @xmath0 as the predicted cobe multipole spectrum in an open universe with curvature fluctuations is too similar to the predicted flat - universe multipole spectrum : @xmath20 is nearly constant .",
    "however , the implied interpretation of the cobe results is quite different in an open - universe model .",
    "if the universe is open , the dominant source of fluctuations in the cobe experiment is not variations in the gravitational potential at the surface of last scatter , but rather variations in the gravitational potential at @xmath21 .",
    "this contrasts with a flat adiabatic model in which the dominant source of fluctuations in the cobe experiment are variations in the gravitational potential at the surface of last scatter , and the gravitational potential is independent of time in the linear regime .",
    "thus if the universe is open , cobe may be seeing microwave fluctuations due to large scale structure at the redshifts of the most distant quasars , rather than looking back to @xmath22    on scales smaller than a few degrees ,  doppler fluctuations \" are an important additional source of cmb fluctuations ( see e.g. , bond et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this process is important for the many experiments probing the cmb on sub - cobe angular scales . on sub - horizon scales at the redshift of recombination , photons , baryons and dark matter particles are not moving at the same velocity .",
    "the photons scatter off of the moving electrons and this produces cmb fluctuations .",
    "since this process is only important on sub - horizon scales , it produces an additional  bump \" in the cmb angular fluctuation spectrum on an angular scale comparable to that subtended by the horizon at the redshift of last scatter . in a flat model ( with or without cosmological constant )",
    ", this process produces cmb fluctuations with a coherence scale of about @xmath23 . in open models ,",
    "this coherence scale is smaller : @xmath24 degrees ( kamionkowski , sugiyama , and spergel 1994 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the cobe - normalized cmb spectrum for several values of @xmath0 with scale - invariant spectra of primordial adiabatic perturbations , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "shown are models with no reionization ( optical depth to the surface of last scattering @xmath27 ) and with reionization ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it was argued that although the amplitude of the doppler peak changes with @xmath29 ( or alternative , with @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 ) , the location of the peak depends primarily on the value of @xmath0 and is relatively insensitive to the other unknown cosmological parameters .",
    "our analysis concluded that open models are consistent with current experiments , and that their distinctive signature is potentially detectable with the current generation of experiments .",
    "while curvature fluctuations in an open universe appear to be compatible with a host of observations , we still lack a natural mechanism for generating scale - invariant fluctuations in an open - universe model . while there has been some work on inflationary open universe models ( lyth and stewart 1990 ; ratra and peebles 1994 ; kamionkowski and liddle 1994 ) at this point they have not been studied in nearly as much detail as flat models .",
    "it should be noted that even if the universe is open , it may have undergone a period of inflation which , for some reason , ended abruptly .",
    "although it is not clear whether such a period of `` frustrated '' inflation could solve the horizon problem , it could indeed provide a causal mechanism for producing primordial adiabatic density perturbations .",
    "perhaps , the most elegant way of generating density fluctuations in an open universe is to assume that at the start of the frw phase the universe was completely homogeneous in both density and composition and that subsequent causal physics generated the density fluctuations that we see today .",
    "the generation of topological defects through symmetry breaking is a natural way of realizing this idea ( kibble 1976 ) .",
    "symmetry breaking is a fundamental part of modern physics and most unification schemes predict multiple phase transitions that may have generated topological defects such as strings , monopoles , and textures ( vilenkin 1985 ) .",
    "it has always been difficult to reconcile inflationary models with defects , thus , one approach is to abandon inflation and its prediction of a flat universe and to consider defects in an open universe ( spergel 1993 ) .",
    "detailed studies of these models , however , have focused on the evolution of these defects in a flat universe despite the difficulties in making defects compatible with inflation .",
    "defects in a flat universe have a relatively simple scaling evolution . in the case of cosmic strings ,",
    "the curvature scale of the strings appears in numerical simulations to be a constant fraction of the horizon size ( e.g. , albrecht and stebbins 1992 ; perivolaropoulos 1993 ) in numerical simulations of global field evolution in an expanding universe , the characteristic scale of textures and the spacing between textures is also found to grow linearly with conformal time in a radiation and matter - dominated universe ( spergel et al .",
    "1990 ; nagasawa and sato 1992 ) .",
    "this scaling form has been used in many studies of these models in flat universes ( vilenkin 1985 ; gooding et al .",
    "1991 ) .    scaling behavior can be seen analytically in the non - linear sigma model ( turok and spergel 1991 ) in the large - n limit .",
    "this model describes the evolution of an n component scalar field @xmath32 constrained to lie on an n-1 dimensional manifold : @xmath33 . with this constraint ,",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is described by the non - linear sigma model ( turok 1989 ) .",
    "this model is an accurate description of theories such as texture on scales larger than the texture unwinding scale , @xmath34 .",
    "spergel ( 1993 ) showed that in the limit of @xmath35 , the coherence scale grows as @xmath36 .",
    "thus , during the matter and radiation dominated epochs , the scale of symmetry breaking grows in conformal coordinates as @xmath37 , while in the curvature - dominated epoch , the scale of symmetry breaking grows as @xmath36 . for cosmic strings",
    ", this implies that the string curvature scales grows with the horizon size during the matter and radiation dominated epochs and then grows as its square root during the curvature dominated epoch .",
    "this is due to the cosmic strings slowing down due to the rapid expansion of the universe during the curvature dominated epoch .",
    "similar behavior is expected for global monopoles and textures .",
    "a simple interpolation between the two scaling forms is @xmath38 . here , the details of the theory determine @xmath39 , the ratio of the field correlation length to the horizon size",
    ".    in a smooth universe , spatial variations in the pressure in one component can lead to the generation of density fluctuations .",
    "it is through this process that strings , textures , and related models produce density fluctuations .",
    "the spatial variations in pressure lead to a source term that produces variations in the metric , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the harmonic expansion of the pressure in the scalar field .",
    "thus , calculation of the evolution of density fluctuations and microwave fluctuations requires that we know the evolution of the pressure in the scalar field and its auto - correlation function . by assuming that the pressure autocorrelation function should depend only on the coherence scale and a constant of proportionality set by the scale of symmetry breaking ,",
    "spergel ( 1993 ) was able to compute microwave and density fluctuations semi - analytically .",
    "this work found that the predicted cmb spectrum was consistent with the amplitude and multipole spectrum observed by cobe .",
    "this motivated further investigation of defect models in an open universe .",
    "pen and spergel ( 1994 ) investigate the texture and monopole scenarios in detail in an open universe by using the non - linear sigma model with the techniques described in pen et al .",
    "figure 5 shows the predicted amplitude of harmonic multipoles in the texture model in an open universe as well as the predicted amplitudes in a scale - invariant model .",
    "it is intriguing that the cobe two - year spectrum ( bennett et al . 1994 ; wright et al . 1994 ) appears to be better fit by the texture open universe model than by a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "a very attractive cosmological model is cosmic strings in an open universe . in a flat cold - dark - matter dominated universe ,",
    "cosmic - string models predict a power spectrum with a peak at too small a physical scale ( albrecht and stebbins 1992 ) .",
    "however , in an open universe , the peak of the power spectrum is shifted to a large angular size . as figure 6 shows , a cosmic string plus cdm model with @xmath42 appears to be a good fit to the galaxy fluctuations power spectrum inferred from the apm survey ( baugh and efstathiou 1993 ) .",
    "the gravitational - wave limits on cosmic strings are weaker in a low-@xmath0 universe than in a flat universe as these limits scale as @xmath43 .",
    "preliminary estimates suggest that a model with cosmic strings in a cold - dark - matter open universe is compatible with both observations of large - scale structure , observations of cmb fluctuations and constraints from the millisecond pulsar .    in these equation - of - state models ,",
    "the amplitude of the low multipole moments are suppressed relative to both flat and open curvature dominated models . since there has not been any time to generate potential fluctuations on large scales in these models , cmb fluctuations are suppressed on large angular scales .",
    "pen and spergel ( 1994 ) find that the multipole spectrum for defect models rises as @xmath44 for @xmath45 and then is flat for @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angular size subtended by the defect coherence length at @xmath21 . for small @xmath44 ( large angular size )",
    ", this spectrum shape is due to incoherent contributions of different causally disconnected regions .",
    "for large @xmath44 , the spectral shape reflects that at the large redshifts at which the fluctuations on small angular separations were generated , @xmath0 was close to 1 .    on small angular scales ( large @xmath44 ) ,",
    "the predictions of topological - defect models are sensitive to assumptions about the ionization history of the universe . as we lack any real understanding of the first generation of stars ,",
    "we can not with any confidence compute the ionization history of a given cosmological model .",
    "fortunately , cmb observations on small angular scales should eventually be able to constrain this history .",
    "however , until the observations are more certain , we must explore different assumed ionization histories .",
    "coulson et al . (",
    "1993 ) have investigated the cmb fluctuations produced by defects in a flat fully ionized universe .",
    "they find on small angular scales , a fluctuation spectrum that is flat on scales larger than the defect coherence size at the surface of last scatter and suppressed for larger @xmath44 .",
    "since they assume that the universe was fully ionized , this implies that cmb fluctuations are suppressed at @xmath48 for cosmic - string , monopole , and texture models .",
    "if the universe is open , then the angular scale associated with the surface of last scatter is smaller and the coulson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) results have to be rescaled so that fluctuations are flat between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "thus , if the universe was fully ionized , the coherence scale of the cmb fluctuations should be the coherence scale of the defect at the surface of last scatter .",
    "on the other hand , the universe may not have been reionized at large redshift by an early generation of stars .",
    "bouchet , bennett , and stebbins ( 1988 ) assume no reionization in their investigation of string models in a flat universe and predict a much higher amplitude of cmb fluctuations on small angular scales .",
    "a potentially distinctive signature of topological - defect models is that the distribution of temperature fluctuations are expected to be non - gaussian .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the inflationary scenario that predicts a flat universe and gaussian microwave fluctuations .",
    "coulson et al . ( 1993 ) suggest that the non - gaussian fluctuations should be largest on small angular scales and most apparent in monopole and texture models .",
    "it is intriguing that the low level of fluctuations found by the acme / hemt experiment ( gaier et al .",
    "1992 , schuster et al .",
    "1993 ) in one region of the sky , @xmath51 , is difficult to reconcile with the detections by the max experiment ( gundersen et al .",
    "1993 ) and the msam experiment ( cheng et al . 1993 ) in other regions of the sky in a gaussian model .",
    "current observations of the cmb fluctuation spectrum are compatible with both open and flat geometries",
    ". however , future observations may be able to detect characteristic signatures of open - universe models . if the density fluctuations that formed galaxies were primordial and the universe is open , then the location of the doppler peak is determined by the geometry of the universe . on the other hand , open - universe models in which the density fluctuations were produced by topological defects at low redshifts do not have a strong doppler peak , but they do have a characteristic signature : a dramatic suppression of fluctuations on large angular scales . while there is a weak suppresion in the curvature models , this effects is more dramatic in the defect models .",
    "these defect models also predict non - gaussian cmb fluctuations .",
    "future experiments that measure the cmb spectrum can potentially determine the geometry of the universe , an observation that would have significant implications for our understanding of the origin of the universe and its ultimate fate .",
