    "red giant seismology is one of the most beautiful unexpected gift of the space missions corot and .",
    "when the corot mission was planned , red giants were seen as unavoidable targets because of their brightness .",
    "their observation has however confirmed that they show solar - like oscillations : as in the solar case , turbulent convection in the uppermost atmosphere excite pressure oscillations .",
    "pressure oscillation modes detected in low - mass stars at different evolution stages , all along the red giant branch ( rgb ) , allow us to perform ensemble asteroseismology . from such study , expressed by scaling relations",
    ", we can derive global stellar properties and get keys for deciphering stellar evolution .",
    "mixed modes , absent in the sun , have been discovered in red giants ( beck et al .",
    "since they result from the coupling of pressure waves propagating in the envelope with gravity waves propagating in the inner radiative regions , they can be used to directly probe the stellar core , from which they extract unique information on the ongoing nuclear rotation ( bedding et al .",
    "2011 , mosser et al .",
    "2011a ) , or on the inner rotation rate ( beck et al .",
    "2012 , deheuvels et al .",
    "2012 , mosser et al .",
    "2012c ) .    a recent review on red giant oscillations can be found in @xcite .",
    "results obtained in red giant seismology are discussed in a companion paper ( mosser et al .",
    "2013b ) , with an emphasis on the seismic scaling relations and on red giant interior structure .",
    "this proceedings paper deals with tricky points related to the data analysis . in section [ radial ] , we discuss different ways to describe and measure the radial - mode oscillation pattern and explain the conditions providing the most precise measurement of the large separation . in section [ dipole ]",
    ", we focus on the dipole mixed - mode pattern and present a toy model used to explain the conditions under which mixed modes are observed .",
    "this models helps understand the so - called depressed mixed modes observed in rgb stars , or the large variety of observable gravity - dominated mixed modes .",
    "we aim to obtain an efficient description of the radial - mode oscillation pattern , for the most precise measurement of their frequencies .",
    "a first step for determining the characteristics of the oscillation pattern consists in the identification of radial modes and in the measurement of the large separation @xmath0 , as it appears as frequency difference between observable modes .",
    "the radial oscillation pattern is , at first - order approximation ( e.g. , tassoul 1980 ) , @xmath1 .",
    "this form derives from an asymptotic analysis and is therefore valid for large radial orders @xmath2 .    in this section ,",
    "we first discuss different methods for measuring @xmath0 .",
    "this large separation is measured around the frequency @xmath3 of maximum oscillation signal , in fact in non - asymptotic conditions .",
    "this explains that the measured value @xmath0 must be distinguished from its asymptotic counterpart .",
    "then , we investigate the different meanings of the large separation , and also the difference between local and global measurements of @xmath0 . finally , we discuss the meaning of the offset parameter @xmath4 .",
    "different methods have been proposed for measuring the large frequency separation of solar - like oscillations .",
    "all these methods have been exhaustively compared , in both main - sequence and red giant regimes ( e.g. , verner et al .",
    ", hekker et al .  2011 ) . among all methods ,",
    "the autocorrelation of the time series presents different advantages ( roxburgh & vorontsov 2006 , mosser & appourchaux 2009 ) .",
    "computationally , the method is rapid since it is based on fourier transforms . for computing the fourier spectrum of the original time series , a lomb - scargle periodogram is required .",
    "then , all following operations are fast fourier transforms of the fourier spectrum .",
    "it allows an automated process , efficient for all large separations in the whole range of solar - like oscillations ( from 0.1 to 200@xmath5hz ) .",
    "it especially works at very low frequency , where , contrary to other methods , the relative poor frequency resolution is not an issue .",
    "dedicated filters can be used to compute the spectrum of the filtered fourier spectrum of the time series .",
    "these filters can be adapted to many situations , from the most efficient global measurement of the mean value of the large separation at @xmath3 to its rapid variations with frequency ( mosser 2010 ) .",
    "the method can also be used for measuring other frequency separations than the large frequency separation .",
    "it has been used successfully to measure the mixed mode spacings ( mosser et al .",
    "2011b ) or the rotational splittings ( mosser et al .",
    "+ many other methods are used for computing the large separation . since",
    "@xmath0 represents the period of the comb - like structure of the oscillation spectrum , its value can be inferred from the autocorrelation of the spectrum .",
    "we however note that this autocorrelation , contrary to the autocorrelation of the time series , does not benefit from the rapid calculation provided by the wiener - khinchin theorem . for space - borne observations benefitting from a very high duty cycle , this method appears to be less efficient than the autocorrelation of the times series .",
    "the concept of large separation has different meanings , depending on the context .",
    "observationally , the large separation @xmath0 is measured from the difference between consecutive radial mode frequencies .",
    "the local or global nature of the value is discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "mosser et al . (",
    "2013 ) have shown that @xmath0 is significantly different from the asymptotic value @xmath6 , which is another important acceptation .",
    "it corresponds to the value introduced by theoretical asymptotic methods ( tassoul 1980 ) and it scales as the inverse of the acoustic diameter of the star .",
    "the large separation intervenes in scaling relations ( belkacem et al .",
    "2013 ) , under the hypothesis that is very close to the dynamical frequency @xmath7 that scales with @xmath8 .",
    "+ the values @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are close to each other , but different .",
    "the measurement of the large separation @xmath0 must try to recover , if possible , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as shown by , linking @xmath6 to @xmath0",
    "is possible if and only if the second - order asymptotic expansion is considered .",
    "then , one has to account for the fact that the large separation is measured in non - asymptotic conditions .",
    "the curvature seen in the spectrum is the signature of this second - order term .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath6 writes @xmath9 the correction term is maximum in the red giant regime ; it corresponds there to a uniform correction , about 3.8% .",
    "confusion is often made between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . since",
    "scaling relations are extensively used for translating the global seismic parameters into seismic proxies of the mass and radius , it is necessary to avoid this confusion .",
    "modeling is therefore useful , as done recently by @xcite who show that , in most cases , the observed large separation is closer to @xmath7 than the asymptotic value @xmath6 .",
    "the different methods used for measuring the large separation provide either a local or a global value of the frequency difference between radial modes . for a local measurement , only 2 or 3 radial orders around @xmath3 are considered : @xmath10 , with the radial frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 close to @xmath3 . for a global measurement , @xmath0 is a weighted mean value calculated in a broad frequency range around @xmath3 .",
    "evil is in the detail : the difference between the local and global measurement is small , but with a systematic component .",
    "have shown that this small difference can be used for distinguishing red giants in the red clump or on the rgb .",
    "this difference is due to glitches ( miglio et al .",
    "2010 ) that depend on the evolutionary stage . therefore",
    ", measuring both the local and global large separations is very useful .",
    "this implies that the modulation due to the glitches is not negligible : it perturbs the measurement of the large separation , in a way that is not related to any of the global properties of the asymptotic large separation or dynamical frequencies .",
    "therefore , using a global value of @xmath0 is certainly the best way to get rid of the glitches that significantly modulate the large separation .",
    "furthermore , the work by mosser et al .",
    "( 2013 ) has shown that the oscillation pattern obeys closely the second - order asymptotic oscillation pattern .",
    "this implies that a global large separation will provide a better measurement than a local value , for allowing the translation into the asymptotic value .",
    "the last step of the demonstration of the advantages of the global measurement is exposed later ( section  [ offset - global ] ) .",
    "one needs first to present a method permitting an efficient global measure .      for red giants ,",
    "an efficient measure is made easy by the large homology of the stellar interiors .",
    "have shown that interior structure homology of red giants translates into homology of their oscillation spectrum . as a consequence , the large separation is enough to parameterize the low - degree spectrum @xmath13 \\ \\dnuobs,\\ ] ] where the offset @xmath4 , the curvature @xmath14 , and the relative separations @xmath15 are functions of the observed large separation @xmath0 .",
    "the curvature term was already suspected in asteroseismology with ground - based observations with a limited frequency resolution , as for instance the procyon observations reported by .",
    "this term is necessary to account for the fact that the large separation is measured around @xmath3 , in non - asymptotic conditions ; in fact , it accounts for the gradient in frequency separations ( @xmath16 , according to the derivation of eq .  [ univ ] ) . the term @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 so that @xmath0 is the large separation measured at the frequency @xmath3 .",
    "such a formalism ensures the most precise translation from the measurement at @xmath3 to the asymptotic value .",
    "the term @xmath17 can be seen as the radial order at @xmath3 . however ,",
    "contrary to a real radial order , @xmath17 is not an integer .    in practice , measuring @xmath0 with the universal pattern is derived from the fit of the observed radial frequencies with a pattern based on eq .",
    "quadrupole modes are in fact fitted too , but not dipole modes , since they show a mixed character and have a more complex structure .",
    "the use of the universal pattern has proven to be efficient , with the following properties : i ) it accounts for the frequency separation gradient ; ii ) the fitting process helps reduce the realization noise due to the fact that the modes are short lived ; iii ) it also lowers the influence of the modulation due glitches discussed above ; iv ) it provides a measure which is not affected by the mixed - mode pattern .",
    "a large part of the accuracy of the universal pattern is due to the introduction of second - order terms . in eq .",
    "[ univ ] , the second - order term is expressed by the curvature @xmath14 , which helps for fitting the radial ridge in a large frequency range . if the second - order term were not taken into account , the error for identifying low or high radial - order radial modes , assuming a perfect match at @xmath3 , could be as large as @xmath19 , which is similar to the separation between quadrupole and radial modes .",
    "consequently , the measure of the large separation is less precise when the curvature is omitted .",
    "the accuracy of the large separations determined from the universal pattern depends on the validity of the relation found for @xmath20 in the asymptotic expansion . from , it is clear that this term is not a surface term : its value is the direct signature of the measurement of the large separation around @xmath3 , in non - asymptotic conditions and @xmath21 is entirely explained by the non - asymptotic value of the commonly used large separation . ] . we can translate an uncertainty in the @xmath22 relation into an uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the derivation of the first - order relation of the radial mode writes : @xmath23 assuming a perfect match at @xmath3 between the observed spectrum and the universal pattern , but a relative displacement @xmath24 ( in unit @xmath0 ) at the extremities of the energy excess envelope , we infer a relative precision of the measurement of the large separation about @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of modes . for sake of simplicity , we take @xmath27 ( mosser et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we can estimate @xmath24 in two ways , from the amplitude of the glitches measured in the red giant oscillation spectrum ( miglio et al . 2010 ) , or by comparison with the relative distance @xmath28 between quadrupole and radial modes . a typical value of the glitch amplitude ( vrard et al .",
    ", in preparation ) is of the order of 2% .",
    "this gives a relative precision in the measurement of the large separation of the order of 0.5% ( or equivalently 0.02@xmath29hz ) at the red clump , in agreement with exhaustive tests and comparisons of different methods performed by .",
    "the comparison between @xmath24 and @xmath28 provides a similar estimate , which quantitatively does not significantly change with @xmath0 .",
    "these results demonstrate the high accuracy of the method , even at low signal - to - ration or with short time series ( hekker et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "we can now interpret the influence of the glitches mentioned in section  [ local - global ] .",
    "when the large separation is measured locally , the term @xmath4 is not simply a function of the large separation , but depends also on the evolutionary status : stars on the rgb or in the red clump have not similar @xmath4 .",
    "the ( small ) difference disappears when the large separation is measured globally , in a large frequency range , as demonstrated by .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath30 relation does not depend on the evolutionary status when @xmath0 is measured globally .",
    "we can investigate the signature of a systematic difference in the @xmath4 relation between the clump and rgb stars .",
    "this difference is about 0.15 , according to . according to eq .",
    "[ erreurs ] , such a difference in @xmath4 translates into a 1.5% difference in @xmath0 at the red clump .",
    "this implies then a relative shift of @xmath31 for radial modes at radial orders close to @xmath32 .",
    "this shift represents one half of the relative separation between the radial and quadrupole modes .",
    "it is definitely not observed when one compare rgb and clump stars oscillation patterns , proving that there is no significant systematic dependance of @xmath4 with the evolutionary status .",
    "it also underlines that the most accurate values of the large separations are measured globally and not locally .",
    "as stated above , the local measurement of @xmath0 is very valuable for measuring , by comparison with the global value , the evolutionary status ; however , a local value is less precise for later use in scaling relations ( see mosser et al .",
    "the radial modes ( together with the quadrupole modes ) have proven to be highly useful for identifying the red giant oscillation spectrum , from early rgb ( deheuvels et al .",
    "2012 ) to red giants in the upper rgb and agb ( mosser et al .",
    "the dipole modes are then most useful to carry information from the stellar core ( beck et al .  2011 , bedding et al .",
    "2011 , montlban et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "dipole modes result from the coupling of pressure _ waves _ excited in the upper stellar envelope with gravity _ waves _ propagating only in the inner radiative region . in red giants",
    ", the latter region approximately corresponds to the core ( except in the helium burning region of the core of red clump stars ) and its surrounding hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "one often reads that mixed modes result from the coupling of gravity _ modes _ propagating in the core with pressure _ modes _ propagating in the envelope .",
    "this shortcut , even if fully clear , does not help understand the physics of mixed modes . apart from the fact that modes , as standing waves , do not propagate",
    ", the coupling of modes is an insecure concept , which does not help understand the physics and the conditions on the _ phase _ of the different waves for constructing the modes .",
    "it is more relevant to imagine a wave excited by turbulent convection in the upper envelope , propagating in the star as a pressure wave ( with pressure acting as a restoring force ) until it reaches the lamb frequency , evanescent beyond this limit , and propagating again but as a gravity wave ( with buoyancy acting as a restoring force ) in the radiative core .",
    "the coupling conditions ensure that various frequencies , and not only the frequency of the pure pressure mode that would exist in absence of the radiative cavity , may efficiently couple .",
    "the resonant conditions then yield to the mixed modes . in red giants",

    "the accuracy of the asymptotic expansion of mixed modes has not yet been directly tested .",
    "however , numerous indirect tests have been made , which indicate the ability of the asymptotic expansion to accurately fit the data :    - it is based , for the pressure part , on the universal oscillation pattern , which is fully operational for radial modes . for the gravity component , it takes the tassoul asymptotic formalism of gravity modes into account . since , the gravity radial orders are quite high ( @xmath42 in the range [ 50  500 ] except in the very early rgb ) , the asymptotic expansion is supposed to apply precisely .",

    "apart from the modelling effort to interpret such mixed modes ( dupret et al .",
    "2009 , for massive stars ) , we propose a simple mechanical model for trying to understand the different cases , including the depressed mixed modes .    in this toy - model",
    ", we consider a chain of three springs and two masses , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ ressort ] .",
    "the stiffness and the mass that , respectively , represent the p and g modes have to fulfil the resonance condition : @xmath44 .",

    "this implies that @xmath47 , since the inertia of gravity modes is much higher than the inertia of pressure modes .",
    "this means that , accordingly , the stiffness @xmath48 of the gravity spring is much stronger than the stiffness @xmath49 of the pressure spring .",
    "the stiffness of the coupling spring is , as one can imagine , representative of the coupling ( note that this coupling has an energetic meaning , contrary to the phase coupling factor discussed above ) .",
    "finally , the excitation mechanism occurs at the extremity of the pressure spring , in order to mimic the free surface of the oscillation and the location of the excitation in the uppermost level .",
    "the opposite extremity of the gravity spring is fixed ; it corresponds to the barycenter of the star .",
    "this toy model can be used to understand typical observations .",
    "we first examine the most common case , where a large number of gravity - dominated mixed modes are observed ( fig .",
    "[ diff_visi ] ) .",
    "we then investigate two opposite ( and extreme ) cases corresponding to the case where the amplitudes of gravity - dominated mixed modes are severely damped , or to the case where only pressure - dominated mixed modes are seen :    - the common case corresponds to a ` moderate ' coupling . in the transitory regime ,",
    "the coupling is low enough to ensure the efficient excitation of pressure waves : the energy input from the oscillation is not significantly perturbed by the leak through the coupling . in a permanent regime",
    ", these ( p-)waves have enough energy to excite then gravity waves",
    ". therefore , the model helps understand the gravity dominated mixed modes .",
    "the stiffness @xmath50 of the coupling spring is low enough to allow significant amplitudes of the p mode , but high enough to regulate the frequency of this p mode by the much more stable gravity oscillator .",
    "depending on the frequency , the resulting modes are dominated either by pressure or gravity .",
    "- a tight coupling corresponds to a very high coupling stiffness . in that case",
    ", we can consider that the masses @xmath45 and @xmath46 are bound together .",
    "since @xmath51 , no significant movement is expected : the excitation at the surface is not efficiently transmitted to @xmath45 and @xmath46 since they are in practice tightly attached by @xmath48 with the immobile center .",
    "the excitation is inefficient : the waves excited at the surface can not reach great amplitudes since that they have to move a very high inertia .",
    "even the pressure - dominated modes can not form .",
    "it is straightforward to consider that the depressed mixed modes , with limited oscillation amplitudes , correspond to this strong - coupling case .",
    "this might correspond to a reduced region between the pressure and gravity cavity .",
    "in other words , the brunt - visl ( bv ) and @xmath52 lamb ( l1 ) frequencies have close values , which are also close to the frequency of the damped modes .",
    "if the bv frequency exceeds the lamb frequency , one may suppose that , with pressure and buoyancy acting as restoring forces , the coupling will be extremely efficient .",
    "- an inefficient coupling is ensured by an absence of the coupling spring .",
    "in that case , the excitation is able to move @xmath45 without any reaction of @xmath46 .",
    "this case corresponds to oscillation spectra without important gravity dominated peaks .",
    "such a coupling may correspond to a wide region between the bv and l1 cavities . in that case",
    ", gravity waves can not be excited .    in this model",
    ", it is possible to suppose , as in the real case , that the power density of the excitation only weakly depends on frequency .",
    "all mixed modes associated to the same pressure mode have then similar height in a power density spectrum .",
    "they just differ by their lifetime .",
    "a condition to reach uniform height is the observation duration , which has to be high enough , higher than the mixed - mode lifetimes , in order to observe resolved modes .",
    "finally , this model helps understand the energy partition reported by .",
    "the excitation taking place in the uppermost envelope is transferred towards the stellar core by p waves only .",
    "the total energy that could be affected to one single p mode is shared between all mixed modes associated to this p mode .",
    "this partition is efficient in most cases , when the coupling between the waves in the two cavities is moderate .",
    "a high coupling induces an important consequence : the dipole modes have a much higher inertia than radial modes , so that their surface amplitudes are totally damped .",
    "rotational splittings observed in a handful of giants have first exhibited the significant radial differential rotation in the red giants interior ( beck et al .",

    "have established seismic diagnostics for transport of angular momentum in stars from the pre - main sequence to the red - giant branch .",
    "they found that transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high a core rotation rate for red - giant models compared with observations .",

    "they were then able to describe the morphology of the rotational splittings , under the hypothesis of linear splittings .",
    "in fact , the mean core rotation dominates the splittings , even for pressure dominated mixed modes . as a consequence",
    ", they provided theoretical support for using a lorentzian profile to measure the observed splittings of red giant stars .",
    "have shown the complexity of the splittings when rotation can not be considered as a perturbation . when rotational splitting are higher than twice the frequency separation between consecutive dipolar modes , non - perturbative computations are necessary .",
    "each family of modes with different azimuthal symmetry @xmath54 has to be considered separately . in case of rapid core rotation , the differences between the period spacings associated with a given azimuthal order @xmath54 constitutes a promising guideline toward a proper seismic diagnostic for rotation .    observing rotational splittings at lower frequencies than reported by is challenging .",
    "first , such an observation requires the presence of gravity - dominated mixed modes . at low @xmath3 ,",
    "such modes have so long lifetimes that very long observations are necessary to unveil them .",
    "second , disentangling mixed - mode spacing and rotational splitting at low @xmath3 is demanding , especially for rgb stars .",

    "<S> the space - borne missions corot and _ kepler _ have opened a new era in stellar physics , especially for evolved stars , with precise asteroseismic measurements that help determine precise stellar parameters and perform ensemble asteroseismology . </S>",
    "<S> this paper deals with the quality of the information that we can retrieve from the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> it focusses on the conditions for obtaining the most accurate measurement of the radial and non - radial oscillation patterns . </S>",
    "<S> this accuracy is a prerequisite for making the best with asteroseismic data . from radial modes , </S>",
    "<S> we derive proxies of the stellar mass and radii with an unprecedented accuracy for field stars . for dozens of subgiants and thousands of red giants , the identification of mixed modes ( corresponding to gravity waves propagating in the core coupled to pressure waves propagating in the envelope ) indicates unambiguously their evolutionary status . as probes of the stellar core </S>",
    "<S> , these mixed modes also reveal the internal differential rotation and show the spinning down of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giant branch . a toy model of the coupling of waves constructing mixed modes </S>",
    "<S> is exposed , for illustrating many of their features . </S>"
