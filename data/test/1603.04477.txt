    "bistable systems are widely utilized to model the biological processes which exhibit distinct phenotypes under homogeneous conditions @xcite . switching between phenotypes ( stable states )",
    "is facilitated by the stochasticity arising from molecular noise @xcite .",
    "the paths of switching have been studied in various systems , such as the @xmath0-phage lysis - lysogeny decision @xcite and cellular development and differentiation @xcite , to gain insights into the molecular processes of biological decision making .    in nature , we sometimes observe situations where multiple bistable systems are coupled .",
    "for example in bacterial quorum sensing , every cell produces small signaling molecules whose production is regulated by a positive feedback to synchronize the population .",
    "this positive feedback may induce bistability between the high and low concentrations of the signaling molecules .",
    "the cells are further coupled by secreting and sensing the signaling molecules in the medium@xcite .",
    "another example is the toxin - antitoxin ( ta ) loci in _ escherichia coli _",
    ", where there are 10 known mrnase toxins and every pair may act as a bistable system allowing the cells to switch between the normal growing state and the dormant state which exhibits antibiotic persistence @xcite . the ta systems may interact each other by interfering the protein synthesis and the cellular growth .",
    "motivated by these systems , in this paper we analyze a coupled bistable system that consists of interacting identical bistable motifs .",
    "we consider the case where coupling is such that the coupled system itself is also bistable and for each stable state the individual motifs are in the same steady state . in other word , the coupling is positive to allow all the bistable motifs to jointly switch from one state to the other state . while the individual bistable systems without coupling show the same pattern of transition paths by definition , the switching properties of the coupled system remain unclear .",
    "the individual systems may transit synchronously at the same pace , resulting in one transition path .",
    "however , it is also possible that individual systems lead the switching process . as a result ,",
    "the transition paths of the coupled system are split into multiple ones , a phenomenon called `` bifurcation of transition path '' . since many properties of the coupled system , such as the transition rates between the steady states , are dependent on the transition paths , it is interesting to study whether the transition paths of a given coupled bistable system bifurcate and how this bifurcation relates to the individual bistable systems and their coupling .",
    "bifurcation of transition paths was first demonstrated in the maier - stein model @xcite , but its relevance and implication to biochemical systems remain to be explored . in this work ,",
    "we first construct a model of coupled bistable gene circuits in section [ modeling ] .",
    "then we demonstrate that the transition paths bifurcate with appropriate parameter sets . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we construct a general formulation of coupled bistable systems .",
    "we consider the transition of this general model between its steady states as a noise - induced exit process from a metastable state and propose a criterion for the bifurcation of transition paths by extending the previous works on the maier - stein model @xcite",
    ". finally in section [ application ] , we apply our criterion to the model of coupled bistable gene circuits .",
    "we confirm the theory numerically and discuss the transition rates .",
    "consider a model of coupled bistable gene circuits ( fig . [ model]a ) .",
    "first we restrict our attention to one gene .",
    "the promoter of the gene is weak and the proteins of this gene bind to the promoter in the form of tetramers to activate the gene expression .",
    "we may model the proteins of this gene using @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the concentration of the protein , @xmath3 refers to the basal synthesis rate of the protein , the hill term describes the activation of gene expression by the tetramers and the last term models the linear degradation . with appropriate parameter values ,",
    "the positive feedback on gene expression allows eq .",
    "[ example1d ] to show bistability .",
    "we now couple @xmath4 such genes in one cell and we assume that all these genes ( and their promoters and proteins ) have the same kinetic properties . the genes are coupled in a way that the proteins of the genes are well - mixed in the cells and the mixture activates a cell by binding to a promoter in a tetramer .",
    "multiple coupling strategies may be used .",
    "for example , if the proteins of the @xmath4 genes are identical , any four monomers may bind a promoter and we may model the coupled bistable gene circuits using @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the concentration of the products of the @xmath7-th gene and @xmath8 is the hill constant for the coupled system . meanwhile , if the genes are equipped with identical promoters but encode different proteins , and the tetramer activating the gene expression consists of four monomers from the same gene , we model the coupled system using @xmath9    we then generalize these examples and we propose the following model of coupled bistable gene circuits @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 , called the configuration parameter , governs the general coupling strategy . it is straightforward that @xmath12 corresponds to eq .",

    "[ alpha4 ] ) such that the steady states of every individual gene are not affected by the coupling . if the model for one gene",

    ", throughout this work we call the stable state where the concentrations of all gene products are low the `` lower stable steady state '' @xmath16 and the other stable steady state the `` higher stable steady state '' @xmath17",

[ example ] ) , every gene is governed by the concentration of its own protein ( @xmath6 , in the degradation term ) and the average concentration of all proteins ( @xmath28 , in the production term ) . here for a general coupled bistable system , we may model the deterministic drifts of the individual bistable systems in the same fashion and describe the effect of noises using @xmath29 which is interpreted as an ito - type stochastic differential equation . here",

    "a wide range of coupled bistable systems may be modeled in the fashion of eq .",

    "we derive our criterion by performing linear perturbation analysis in the zero - noise limit .",
    "when the noise level of a system reaches zero ( @xmath43 ) , the transition between stable steady states is dominated by the path(s ) associated with the lowest energy cost ( or `` action '' in standard terminology ) .",
    "this path is called the most probable escape path ( mpep)@xcite . the mpep can be quantified analytically since it is governed by the freidlin - wentzell hamiltonian @xcite , allowing ones to use the tools of analytical mechanics for derivation .",
    "one property of mpep in conventional cases is that the mpep of transition passes through the saddle of the system ( refer to @xcite ) and after that the system follows the deterministic flow to the final stable steady state @xcite . in our formulation of coupled bistable systems eq .",
    "[ model_defn ] , the individual bistable systems are always driven by the same deterministic drift after passing the saddle .",
    "we then conclude that no bifurcation of transition paths will occur between saddle and the final steady state .",
    "therefore , the transition capable of bifurcation is the one from the initial stable steady state to the saddle , and we may restrict our attention to this exit process .",
    "the exit process may be studied with the approach of linear perturbation . to be precise , we first assume that the mpep does not bifurcate , i.e. all the bistable systems take the same state during the transition",
    ". we then perturb the shape of mpep by allowing some bistable systems to be in different states from the others during transition and we examine how the associated actions for the perturbed mpep change . if the actions always increase regardless of the perturbation , the non - bifurcating path is locally energetically favorable . for the model of coupled bistable gene circuits ,",
    "we confirm by numerical simulation that this path is indeed the mpep .",
    "meanwhile , if any perturbation leads to a decreased action , the non - bifurcating path is energetically unfavorable .",
    "the mpep should then be some other paths . due to the symmetry of the coupled system",
    ", multiple paths must exist .",
