    "there are numerous connections between graph polynomials and knot invariants in the literature .",
    "perhaps the best known connection between knot and graph polynomials is due to m.  thistlethwaite . in his seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "thistlethwaite proved that the jones polynomial of an alternating link in @xmath0 can be recovered as an evaluation of the tutte polynomial of a plane graph .",
    "thistlethwaite s theorem was extended by l.  kauffman in @xcite where he showed that the jones polynomial of any link can be obtained as an evaluation of the signed tutte polynomial of an edge - signed plane graph ( or equivalently the @xmath1 potts partition function of a plane graph ) .",
    "more recently , m.  khovanov constructed a homological generalization of the jones polynomial . in his influential paper @xcite",
    ", he constructed a bigraded homology theory for knots whose graded euler characteristic is equal to the jones polynomial .",
    "khovanov s homology groups are themselves knot invariants and are in fact strictly stronger knot invariants than the jones polynomial .",
    "thus khovanov constructed a homological generalization of the jones polynomial . with thistlethwaite",
    "s theorem in mind , it is natural to question whether relations between graph polynomials and the jones polynomial `` categorify '' .",
    "that is to ask if one can construct a homology theory for graphs with the two properties that a given graph polynomial arises as the euler characteristic of the homology , and that the khovanov homology of a link can be recovered from the graph homology of an associated graph , or the graph homology can be recovered from the khovanov homology of an associated link .",
    "we will refer to this type of relation as a `` thistlethwaite - type relation '' .",
    "this question on graph and knot homologies motivates the material presented here .",
    "before we move on from these motivational considerations , we consider additional desirable properties that we would like such a graph homology to have .    from the point of view of graph theory , thistlethwaite s connection between the jones and tutte polynomials is a little unsatisfactory in that the relation is between links and plane graphs .",
    "we do not want to impose any planarity conditions on our homology theories .",
    "we would rather consider homology theories for graphs embedded in surfaces of any genus .",
    "this means that we would like to construct a homology theory for embedded graphs , such that when the graph is a plane graph , then we obtain the desired relations with khovanov homology . therefore instead of considering graphs and their polynomials , we consider fatgraphs and their polynomials .",
    "a fatgraph is a graph equipped with a cyclic ordering of the incident half - edges at each vertex .",
    "fatgraphs capture the essential part of an embedded graph .",
    "we note that fatgraphs are also known in the literature as `` ribbon graphs '' and `` maps '' , but here favour the term `` fatgraph '' which is standard in theoretical physics ( see for example @xcite ) . rather than working with the tutte polynomial , when dealing with fatgraphs we instead consider the bollobs - riordan polynomial @xcite .",
    "this is a recently defined generalization of the tutte polynomial to ribbon graphs which captures some of the topology of the fatgraph .",
    "thistethwaite s theorem relating the jones polynomial and the tutte polynomial of a plane graph was recently generalized by s.  chmutov and i.  pak . in @xcite ( which was published in a revised form @xcite ) , the jones polynomial of a ( certain type of ) link in a thickened surface was shown to be an evaluation of the bollobs - riordan polynomial of an associated fatgraph .",
    "furthermore , when the surface is of genus zero , chmutov and pak s result specialises to thistlethwaite s theorem .",
    "we note there is currently interest in connections between knots and their polynomials and fatgraphs and their polynomials @xcite .",
    "this discussion of motivates the categorifications of fatgraph polynomials proposed herein .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . after making some preliminary definitions , in section  [ construction ]",
    "we construct a bigraded chain complex using the set of spanning subfatgraphs of a fatgraph .",
    "we then show that the graded euler characteristic of the homology of this complex is the chromatic polynomial , thus we have categorified the chromatic polynomial .",
    "some properties of this homology and connections with other homology theories in the literature are then given in section  [ sec : props ] .",
    "motivated by the discussion above , in section  [ sec.sbr ] we consider categorifications of the bollobs - riordan polynomial of a fatgraph .",
    "we show how the construction of our chromatic homology can be extended to give a homology theory from which the bollobs - riordan polynomial can be recovered as the graded euler characteristic .",
    "we then prove that both our chromatic homology from section  [ construction ] , and the khovanov homology of an associated link can be recovered from our fatgraph homology .",
    "this provides our first thistlethwaite - type relation between graph and knot homology theories .    in section  [ sec : khov ]",
    "we reconsider our chromatic homology and prove some connections with khovanov homology .",
    "this section contains two main results .",
    "one of the main results provides a second thistlethwaite - type relation which states that our chromatic homology for a plane graph can be recovered from the khovanov homology of an associated link .",
    "the other main result in this section states that the torsion - free part of our chromatic homology is independent of the choice of embedding of a plane graph .",
    "the proof of this result utilises the relation with khovanov homology as well as some recent results on khovanov homology .    in the final section we provide a relation between l.  helme - guizon and y.  rong s categorification of the chromatic polynomial introduced in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , a categorification of the bollobs - riordan polynomial and khovanov homology .",
    "specifically we construct a homology theory for the bollobs - riordan polynomial which comes equipped with two natural homomorphisms : one to helme - guizon and rong s chromatic homology and the other to khovanov homology .",
    "thus both of these homology theories arise from one homology theory for the bollobs - riordan polynomial .",
    "this addresses the question  what is the relationship [ of helme - guizon and rong s chromatic homology ] with the khovanov homology for knots ? \" , which was posed in @xcite .",

    "the homology groups @xmath30 are strictly stronger graph invariants than the chromatic polynomial .",
    "the poincar polynomial is invariant on different planar embeddings of a planar graph @xmath5 .",

    "our chromatic homology can also be recovered from this homology .",

    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 it is easily seen that the modules @xmath78 have graded dimensions equal to the laurent polynomial ( [ eq : poly ] ) .    in order to simplify the text , we abuse notation and identify the state of a fatgraph with its assigned polynomial term ( [ eq : poly ] ) and its assigned graded module ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "next , as in the calculation for @xmath49 in the example above , we arrange the states into @xmath79 columns indexed by the height of the corresponding state of the fatgraph , so the @xmath80-th column contains all modules which come from states of height @xmath80 .",

    "however , khovanov s homology of links requires a unique choice of algebra for isotopy invariance , and since our proof of the invariance of the poincar polynomial for planar fatgraph homology ( theorem  [ th : invariance ] ) is dependent upon the invariance of khovanov homology , we do not know if the corresponding result holds over different algebras .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our homology theory is motivated by khovanov s categorification of the jones polynomial and thistlethwaite s theorem connecting the jones and tutte polynomials .",
