    "we utilize the full mosaics available for each galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : galaxies ] shows the irac 3.6@xmath35 m images of the targeted galaxies . in what follows , we describe our methodology ( section[sec : photo ] ) and present the point - source catalogs ( section[sec : cats ] ) .",
    "in this section , we detail how we obtained the photometric measurements at various wavelengths and combined them to construct the point - source catalogs .",
    "although the procedures followed here are derived from the techniques developed by @xcite and @xcite , there are some key differences , as we now carry out an inventory of all point sources rather than targeting a particular sub class with desired photometric properties .    specifically , @xcite searched for very red mid - ir ( @xmath36 ) sources near or at the detection limit of the first two irac bands , and therefore included in their primary source - list objects that were detected in the @xmath12 but not the @xmath11 image , as well as objects that could only be detected in the @xmath37 difference image but not in either of the individual images .",
    "@xcite focused on the most luminous mid - ir ( @xmath38 ) sources with a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that is either flat across the four irac bands or rising towards the longer wavelengths , and therefore included in the primary source list all objects that had @xmath39 in any of the first three ( @xmath40 ) irac bands",
    ".    in this work , we implement strict detection criteria by selecting all sources detected at @xmath10 in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images within a certain matching radius as point sources .",
    "next , we search for @xmath10 detections of these point sources in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 images within the same matching radius . if no counterpart is found , we attempt to measure the flux at the location of the @xmath41 point source through psf fitting , and failing that , through aperture photometry . for the mips @xmath1 images , we only use aperture photometry due to the much lower resolution and larger psf size compared to the irac images .",
    "finally , for all objects that do not have a @xmath42 detection at @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 , we estimate the @xmath16 flux upper limits .",
    "the fluxes and upper limits are transformed to vega - calibrated magnitudes using the flux zero points and aperture corrections provided in the _ spitzer _ data analysis cookbook .",
    "given this broad outline , we now describe the specific technical details of how we performed the measurements at the various stages of constructing the catalogs .",
    "we used the daophot / allstar psf - fitting and photometry package  @xcite to construct the psfs , to identify the @xmath10 sources , and to measure their flux at all @xmath43 irac bands .",
    "the different roll angles of the various _ spitzer _",
    "observations made it necessary to construct the psfs for each galaxy in each band independently .",
    "next , we empirically determined the optimal radius to match the @xmath11 and @xmath12 source lists .",
    "figure[fig : match ] shows the distribution of distances to the nearest @xmath11 source for each @xmath12 source in m33 . in this case , over @xmath44 have a match within @xmath45pixel .",
    "the density of nearest matches falls rapidly between @xmath46pixel ( @xmath47 additional matches ) , while the number of duplicates increases ( @xmath48 duplicate matches ) , and then the distribution essentially flattens .",
    "similar distributions are observed for the other six galaxies ( see table[tab : stats ] ) .",
    "we therefore adopted an empirically motivated matching radius of 1pixel in order to maximize the number of matches for a minimal number of chance superpositions .",
    "we used the iraf apphot / phot tool for performing aperture photometry at the point - source locations for all irac bands and the mips @xmath1 band .",
    "for the four irac bands , we use an extraction aperture of @xmath49 , a local background annulus of @xmath50 , and aperture corrections of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 respectively . for the mips @xmath1 band ,",
    "we use an extraction aperture of @xmath55 , a local background annulus of @xmath56 , and an aperture correction of @xmath57 . we estimate the local background using a @xmath58 outlier rejection procedure in order to exclude sources located in the local sky annulus , and correct for the excluded pixels assuming a gaussian background distribution .",
    "using a background annulus immediately next to the signal aperture minimizes the effects of background variations in the crowded fields of the galaxies .",
    "we also determine the @xmath16 flux upper limit for each aperture location using the local background estimate .",
    "ideally , flux measurements of an isolated point source through either aperture or psf photometry would produce the same results after appropriate aperture corrections ( in the first case ) and small zero - point offsets ( in the second case ) to account for flux underestimation due to psf fitting up to finite radius rather than to infinity .",
    "we derive this small ( usually @xmath59mag ) offset for each image from the mean difference between the magnitudes of relatively isolated , unsaturated bright sources measured through aperture and psf photometry . for fainter sources , especially in limited spatial resolution images of crowded fields , the aperture and psf photometry measurements can vary significantly .",
    "figure[fig : offset ] shows the differences between apparent magnitudes determined through aperture and psf photometry as a function of psf magnitude for the @xmath60 sources in ngc6822 and m81 . for the less crowded case of ngc6822",
    ", the two measurements generally agree for the very brightest sources in all four irac bands , with the scatter increasing for the fainter sources .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images of m81 , but at @xmath14 , the scatter is much worse , although a sequence of bright sources with good agreement between the two sets of measurements can still be seen .",
    "however , for @xmath15 , such a sequence can not be clearly identified .",
    "we found this to be true for the other galaxies and m81 shows behavior that is representative of all the targets apart from ngc6822 .",
    "mismatches between the two magnitudes are a good indicator of when crowding is significantly effecting the magnitude estimates , and in the catalogs we list the difference between the psf and aperture photometry magnitudes for each source .    because of these crowding problems , we do not attempt to fine tune the @xmath15 psf photometry measurements by applying the small linear offset , although we do this for the other three irac bands . for all irac bands ,",
    "we universally prefer psf photometry over aperture photometry , because psf fitting is more successful at extracting relatively fainter sources in crowded fields . by definition ,",
    "the nature of psf fitting is that it takes into account whether the flux distribution of a potential point source is consistent with the psf shape , and the degree of agreement or disagreement is reflected by a smaller or larger photometric uncertainty . rather than conducting a bulk accounting of all excess flux within an aperture , psf fitting measures a weighted sum of excess flux within a finite aperture .",
    "this is significant for fainter sources in crowded fields that are often close to brighter sources .",
    "psf fitting more accurately identifies the flux associated with such sources isolating the contamination from other sources as well as more accurately subtracting the local sky . on the other hand ,",
    "aperture photometry can significantly over subtract the sky and underestimate the source flux , or overestimate the source flux by failing to remove contamination from nearby brighter sources .",
    "nevertheless , aperture photometry proves very useful for validating the psf photometry measurements at the bright end in all irac bands , for estimating @xmath14 and @xmath15 fluxes where psf fitting fails and @xmath1 flux where the lower resolution makes psf photometry infeasible , and for determining flux upper limits .    to summarize , we implement strict detection criteria by requiring a @xmath10 detection of all cataloged sources at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we then complement those measurements at the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 bands through a combination of psf and aperture photometry , preferring psf fitting over aperture photometry at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and exclusively using aperture photometry at @xmath1 .",
    "for all objects that do not have a @xmath42 detection at these three longer wavelengths , we estimate @xmath16 flux upper limits .",
    "in this section , we discuss the results of our mid - ir photometric survey . because we required a @xmath10 detection for each source at @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the effective survey area for each galaxy is the overlap of the irac @xmath11 and @xmath12 image mosaics .",
    "table[tab : stats ] lists the effective survey area , gas phase ( h@xmath61 ) star formation rates adopted from @xcite and the number of point sources cataloged in each galaxy followed by the number of matches at @xmath62 and @xmath46 pixel , duplicates between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 source lists , and the number of @xmath10 counterparts identified at the three longer wavelength images for each galaxy .",
    "tables@xmath63 list the coordinates ( j@xmath64 ; ra and dec ) of the point sources followed by their vega calibrated apparent magnitudes ( @xmath65 ) , the associated @xmath66 uncertainties ( @xmath67 ) , and ( for the @xmath68 bands ) the differences between the psf and aperture photometry magnitudes ( @xmath69 ) . for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 bands",
    ", @xmath70 implies that the associated photometric measurement is a @xmath71 flux upper limit , and @xmath72 ( as well as @xmath70 ) indicates that no reliable photometric measurement could be obtained for that location .",
    "for the irac bands , @xmath73 implies that one or both of the associated photometric measurements did not yield a @xmath10 flux measurement .",
    "figures [ fig : cmd16a ] and [ fig : cmd16b ] present the @xmath74vs.@xmath75 , @xmath76vs.@xmath77 , and @xmath78vs.@xmath79 color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for each galaxy . for comparison , we include the mid - ir cmds for all sources in a @xmath80deg@xmath81 region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) of the noao bootes field produced from the _ spitzer _ deep wide field survey ( sdwfs , * ? ? ?",
    "our catalogs simply inventory all the sources present on the image mosaics and do not attempt to distinguish between sources actually associated with the galaxies and unrelated contaminants .",
    "the contamination is significant for galaxies like ngc247 , which is highly inclined and covers a smaller fraction of the _ spitzer _ images , than for the larger and more face - on galaxies ( see figure[fig : galaxies ] ) .",
    "indeed , the cmds of ngc247 ( figure[fig : cmd16b ] , second column ) clearly show two distinct population of sources , with the break appearing near @xmath82 .",
    "the cmds of the two closest galaxies ( ngc6822 and m33 ) show distinguishable sequences of bright and red agb stars ( near @xmath83 ) , but for the more distant galaxies this feature is less prominent ( see @xcite for relevant discussion ) .",
    "the cmds of ngc7793 has the fewest identified point sources both due to its lower mass and because of poorer quality ( more systematic artifacts ) of its image mosaics .",
    "figure [ fig : mhist ] show the apparent magnitude histograms of all sources in the catalog , with the shaded regions showing the sources in m33 .",
    "it is apparent that the m33 catalog is @xmath84mag shallower than the other catalogs in all bands .",
    "overall , our source lists become significantly incomplete at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "figure[fig : chist ] show the mid - ir color histograms of all sources in the catalog , with the shaded regions showing the sources with @xmath66 uncertainty in color @xmath89 .",
    "it demonstrates the absence of any surprises in the color distributions and that the mid - color distributions are not due to large uncertainties .",
    "all normal stars have the same mid - ir color in the first two irac bands , because of the rayleigh - jeans tails of their spectra , and we see this from the sharp peak of color distribution at @xmath90 .",
    "the longer wavelength detections are increasingly dominated by dusty stars , with color distribution peaks at @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "figures [ fig : mhist ] and [ fig : chist ] also show the apparent magnitude and color histograms of the sdwfs point sources ( dotted lines ) .",
    "they show that our catalogs are @xmath94mag deeper than the sdwfs catalog and the mid - ir color distribution of blank - field extragalactic sources significantly differs from that of fields containing nearby galaxies . in particular , at longer wavelengths , the galaxies contain more red sources ( dusty stars ) while the random extragalactic field sources are generally bluer .",
    "although we report the @xmath1 photometry in the catalogs , these measurements have limited utility due to the lower spatial resolution of this band .",
    "the aperture used for this band commonly includes objects other than the intended target and is contaminated by emission from cold interstellar dust .",
    "nevertheless , as we showed in figure5 of @xcite , the spectral energy distributions of the normal stars show the expected negative slope for the rayleigh - jeans tail of their seds between @xmath95 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 photometry can be very useful in specific cases , such as for studying evolved massive stars ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , despite the resolution limitation .    where @xcite identified @xmath96 sources in m33 , and @xcite identified @xmath97 sources in ngc300 and @xmath98 sources in m81 , now we catalog @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 sources in these galaxies respectively .",
    "this is due to a number of factors .",
    "first , both of the earlier studies only cataloged the central regions of these galaxies , while here we analyze the full mosaics .",
    "second , we use a larger matching radius of @xmath102pixel ( rather than @xmath45pixel ) to define point sources and a higher fraction of our cataloged sources can be coincidental matches between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "third , the catalogs presented here are deeper due to improved photometry and search methods based on lessons learned from @xcite . for example , @xcite noted that their m@xmath3 point - source list becomes incomplete at @xmath103 , while we reach @xmath84mag deeper for this galaxy and @xmath104mag deeper for the rest .    we have compared our m33 , ngc300 and m81 catalogs with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 catalogs published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the photometric measurements at these two bands agree within the stated uncertainties for the brighter sources , with the scatter increasing towards the fainter sources . as is apparent from figure[fig : compare ] , we identify zero point linear offsets between the older catalogs and the measurements reported here due to calibration differences .",
    "@xcite performed psf - fitting photometry and then converted the measurements to vega - calibrated magnitudes using simple flux zero point shifts derived from aperture photometry flux measurements of @xmath105 bright and isolated stars in each band . on the other hand , in this work as well as in @xcite , we perform the psf and aperture photometry measurements independently and then convert both to vega - calibrated magnitudes using the flux zero points provided in the _ spitzer _ data analysis cookbook .",
    "this appears to have led to the @xmath106magnitude linear zero - point offset between the @xcite calibrations and our measurements for m33 .",
    "the more subtle offset between the @xcite calibrations and the measurements we report here for ngc300 and m81 are due to the earlier work having used a background annulus far from the aperture ( @xmath107 aperture , @xmath108 annulus ) to measure the local sky brightness when performing aperture photometry , whereas in this work we use a background annulus immediately adjacent to the aperture ( @xmath49 aperture , @xmath109 annulus ) . in a crowded field , where a source is likely to be contaminated by flux from adjacent sources , an annulus far from the aperture",
    "can underestimate the local sky . as the aperture photometry measurement",
    "is used to fine tune the psf photometry to account for psf fitting up to a finite radius rather than to infinity , this appears to have caused the @xmath110magnitude offset .",
    "we identified this issue previously and adopted the current practice of using a background annulus immediately adjacent to the aperture @xcite .",
    "point - source catalogs of the inherently crowded galaxy fields that we are surveying are bound to be crowding limited , not just magnitude limited .",
    "while figure[fig : chist ] empirically demonstrates that our source detection peaks at a certain magnitude and then falls off rapidly , it is likely that incompleteness is affecting even the bright - star counts , increasing towards and through the peak .",
    "for example , @xcite suggests that even in a sparse field , incompleteness at the @xmath111 detection level can be on the order of @xmath112 .",
    "ideally , performing an artificial star completeness test through addition of randomly distributed artificial objects in the images could be useful",
    ".    however , the mid - ir bright stars ( massive stars ) are not randomly distributed , but in fact are highly clustered . performing an efficiency determination test through addition of",
    "randomly distributed artificial objects in the images therefore would lead us to either overestimate or underestimate the efficiency .",
    "for such a study to be truly useful , it would require a proper `` star - star correlation function '' to be employed for spatial distribution of artificial stars .",
    "a star - star correlation function can also characterize the typical scale of the star clusters in each galaxy as a function of magnitude , to investigate the possible affect of aliasing .",
    "such detailed modeling of source distribution is beyond the scope of the current paper and we encourage future studies to explore this issue .",
    "this catalog is a resource as an archive for studying mid - ir transients and for planning observations with the james webb space telescope .",
    "our survey is being expanded to galaxies with @xmath113x higher integrated star formation rate than for these seven galaxies .",
    "while we have shown that surveys for stellar populations are feasible using archival spitzer data , jwst will be a far more powerful probe of stars in the mid - ir .",
    "the nearly order - of - magnitude higher resolution @xcite of jwst compared to _",
    "spitzer _ can be used either to greatly reduce the problem of confusion in these galaxies or to greatly expand the survey volume .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for providing helpful feedback .",
