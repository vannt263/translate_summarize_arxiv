    "btev is a new experiment being prepared at fnal , usa @xcite .",
    "it is aimed at challenging the standard model explanation of cp - violation , mixing and rare decays in the _",
    "b- _ and _ c-_quark systems",
    ". to study final states containing photons , an electromagnetic calorimeter using lead tungstate ( pbwo@xmath3 ) scintillating crystals will be used .",
    "the energy resolution of this type of calorimeter is expected to be better than 1% for photon ( or electron ) energies above 10  gev .",
    "we need to measure the resolution with a beam able to span a wide range of electron energies and yet having a low contamination of hadrons and muons .",
    "the energy of each beam electron shouldbe known with a precision significantly less than 1% .",
    "an electron beam in the energy range of 1 to 45 gev which satisfies the above requirements has been commissioned at the u70 accelerator at protvino , russia .",
    "we determine the energy of each individual electron using a beam tagging system , since the natural energy spread of the beam is @xmath4  3  % at 27  gev .",
    "the tagging system consists of a spectrometer magnet and four drift chamber stations . in order to decrease multiple scattering ,",
    "the beam was transported in vacuum .",
    "this system was able to measure the beam particle momentum with a precision of 0.13% at 45  gev , where the contribution of multiple scattering is negligible . at 1",
    "gev a precision of momentum measurements was 2% , where multiple scattering dominated .",
    "it is worth noting that , we measure the absolute value of the beam momentum to 1 - 2% accuracy , not as well as the above resolution .",
    "it is due to the accuracy of the spectrometer magnetic field measurements . for our studies of the electromagnetic calorimeter prototype",
    "we do not need to know the absolute value of the beam energy with a very high precision since the energy resolution does not strongly depend on energy .",
    "the high intensity of the electron beam ( up to @xmath5 per accelerator spill at 27  gev ) and low background provide a good environment to study crystal radiation hardness .",
    "the same beam channel was able to provide a high intensity ( up to @xmath6 per accelerator spill ) 40  gev pion beam .",
    "a method to obtain an electron beam from u70 proton beam is based on decays of neutral mesons ( mainly @xmath7-mesons ) from the proton beam interactions on an internal carbon film target @xcite .",
    "photons from @xmath7-decays are converted to electrons in an additional target ( converter1 ) made of @xmath43 mm ( 0.7x@xmath8 ) thickness pb plate placed 6.6  m from the internal target .",
    "( see fig.[fig : beam_optics ] ) . charged hadrons from the internal target are swept away from the @xmath9-quanta path by the u70 accelerator magnetic field and do nt enter the beam line .",
    "a small number of hadrons in the electron beam are produced by neutron interactions with converter1 .",
    "electrons from converter1 are guided by the accelerator magnetic field to the beam line entrance .",
    "the output electron beam momentum is defined by the radial position of the internal target .",
    "the converter1 placement in the accelerator chamber allows to obtain more intense beams ( @xmath10 electrons per @xmath11 protons ) but reduces the available electron beam momentum range to 25 - 45  gev .",
    "a further decreasing of initial momenta of electrons was obtained using an oriented silicon crystal @xcite ( converter2 ) which was placed before the analyzing magnet m5 . the electron beam after converter2 has a wide momentum spectrum due to bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the fields of the magnetic elements are setup proportionally to a beam momentum .",
    "finally we have electron beam with any required energy from  1 gev up to  45 gev .",
    "it usually took us about 15 minutes to tune the beam line elements for given energy .",
    "the beam momentum spread was @xmath12p / p @xmath4  3  % at 27  gev and was too large to study the energy resolution of pbwo@xmath3 crystals .",
    "so we decided to install momentum tagging system to measure the momentum of each electron .",
    "it consisted of four drift chamber stations ( dc ) and a 4 meter long spectrometer magnet denoted m14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_setup ] ) .",
    "the magnet deflected the beam in the horizontal plane by 55  mrad .",
    "the magnet current was adjustable in order to provide the same bending angle for all energies of the electron beam .",
    "the _ x _ and _ y _ positions of the charged particle were measured in each dc station with a pair of drift chambers in each view , which shared the same gas volume .",
    "each chamber has a @xmath13@xmath14 sensitive area .",
    "the third station , dc3 , has only a pair of chambers measuring the _ x _ coordinate . all together four dc stations consisted of fourteen drift chambers .",
    "the internal structure of a pair of drift chambers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_struct ] .            each drift cell is formed by a signal ( sense ) wire in the center , field wires at the edges of the cell and cathode planes perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the signal wires are separated by 2.4  cm corresponding to a maximum drift distance of 1.2  cm .",
    "the signal wires of the second chamber were shifted by 1.2  cm to resolve the left - right ambiguity .",
    "the distance between signal wires and cathode planes is 5  mm .",
    "the signal wires were made of gold plated tungsten ( 20  @xmath15 diameter ) and field wires , beryllium - copper alloy ( 100  @xmath15 diameter ) .",
    "the cathode planes were made of graphite coated ( 5  @xmath15 ) mylar ( total thickness 25  @xmath15 ) . to complete the electrostatic shielding of the modules , aluminized mylar ( 25  @xmath15 mylar and less then 1  @xmath15 al )",
    "was placed on the sides of the box .",
    "each chamber required two high voltages : the cathode voltage ( hvc ) , and the voltage on the field wires ( hvf ) to make a uniform electric field along the cell . during the experiment",
    "all chambers were operated with hvc= -1.8 kv and hvf= -2.9 kv .        a mixture of argon ( 70% ) and isobutane ( 30% ) gas was used .",
    "the operating voltages gave a field gradient of 1  kv / cm in the main part of the drift space , which is enough to provide for a saturated drift velocity .",
    "the design of the dc internal structure and operating voltages were the result of a compromise between predictions of a garfield simulation for a constant drift velocity within the drift cell , track detection efficiency , and our requirement of minimum materials .    assuming that the drift velocity is constant over the entire cell",
    ", we achieved the required track precision .",
    "the actual measured time distribution function for one of the drift chambers , @xmath16 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_r_func ] where _ x _ was obtained from a track fit over the three other dc stations .",
    "it shows some non - uniformity , so the precision of the track reconstruction can be improved further by fitting the drift velocity as a function of _ x_. the dc efficiency is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dceff ] .",
    "we reach the @xmath1790% level over most of the cell .",
    "the drift time was measured by lecroy  3377 tdc with a 1  ns / count accuracy .",
    "the fraction of electrons in the beam for various momenta were estimated in the following way . at the end of the beam line , after dc4 ( see fig.[fig : dc_setup ] ) , we place a box containing a 5@xmath185 matrix of lead tungstate scintillating crystals . using information from the drift chambers , beam particles which hit within a @xmath19 region in the center of the crystal matrix have been selected .",
    "the crystals are square , 27 mm on each of the lateral side and 220 mm in length .",
    "for these events , the energy deposit in the entire calorimeter was measured .",
    "fig [ fig : mom10 ] shows the distribution of these measured energies for 10 gev electron beam data .",
    "this is the worst case in terms of electron beam purity .",
    "we see clean muon and electron peaks at about @xmath20gev and @xmath21gev , respectively and the energy deposit from hadronic showers between them .",
    "the relatively large muon fraction was useful to monitor the stability of the calorimeter prototype properties .",
    "the events with the energy deposit greater than 0.9 of mean value of the peak corresponding to the beam energy have been assigned to electrons .",
    "the rest of the events are background particles , muons and hadrons .",
    "the measured fractions of electrons in the beam for each beam energy are shown in table  [ tab : frac ] .",
    "all fractions are determined to an absolute accuracy of 1% .",
    ".fraction of electrons in the beam at various energies [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : beam_mom ]    @xmath22    from ( [ eq : sigma2x ] ) we found @xmath23 = 0.16  mm , which corresponds to a single chamber resolution to be 160*@xmath24 . when we put ( [ eq : sigma2x ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma2 t ] ) in equation ( [ eq : sigma2t_full ] ) , we obtain @xmath25    the results of the calculations using ( [ eq : sigma2th ] ) are given in column 4 of the table [ tab : beam_mom ] as the measured values for a beam momentum resolution .",
    "the last column of the same table shows the measured by our spectrometer beam momentum spread ( @xmath26/p ) in % , where @xmath26 represents fwhm/2.35 of the main peak since the momentum distribution is non - gaussian .",
    "the geometry of this beam line was reproduced in a geant monte carlo simulation taking into account the real materials distribution .",
    "the moliere theory , corrected for finite angle scattering , was used to calculate the effect of multiple coulomb scattering on the charged particle trajectory .",
    "the position resolution of each drift chamber station was taken as a gaussian distribution with @xmath27  mm .",
    "the momentum resolution was reconstructed using the same cuts as the real data .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : beam_mom ] .",
    "where , @xmath28 is the relative error of the electron momentum . @xmath23 and @xmath2 are the r.m.s . of the gaussian fit of the corresponding distribution .",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on energy was also simulated by geant .",
    "the results are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmap ] .",
    "solid line represents monte carlo simulation , filled squares real measurements .",
    "estimated errors of the experimental data are inside the markers .",
    "there is a good agreement between the simulation data and the real measurements which are shown in table [ tab : beam_mom ] and fig.[fig : sigmap ] .",
    "it proves the validity of our drift chamber resolution determination described above .",
    "the experience of long - term operation of a modified beam line for electrons with energies in the range of 1 to 45 gev described in this paper shows that this technique significantly expands the possibilities to study precise energy and coordinate resolutions of scintillating crystals .",
    "independent of the momentum spread of the electron beam at the level of 1 to 5% at energies from 45 down to 1 gev , the momentum tagging station gives a beam momentum resolution from 0.13 to 2% in the same energy range .",
    "the precision is limited by drift chamber spatial resolution and multiple coulomb scattering on a material in the beam line .",
    "geant monte carlo simulations of the resolution agree very well with the experimental results .",
    "an opportunity to switch the beam line from electrons to high energy pions with high intensities ( up to 10@xmath0 e@xmath30 and 10@xmath31 per spill ) allows the study radiation hardness properties of scintillating crystals both for electrons and hadrons with moderate dose rates of up to 100 rad / hour .",
    "these dose rates are similar to the ones that will be in btev at fermilab and in cms at cern .",
    "integrated doses up to several krad can be accumulated in this setup in a relatively short time .",
    "we would like to thank the ihep management for providing us a beam line and accelerator time for our testbeam studies .",
    "special thanks to fermilab for providing equipment for data acquisition .",
    "this work was partially supported by the u. s. national science foundation and the department of energy ."
