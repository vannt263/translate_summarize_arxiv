    "the phase space of stckel potentials is completely occupied by four major families of regular orbits : the boxes , and the three families of tubes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "roughly the same is true in many nonrotating triaxial potentials corresponding to mass models with smooth cores : most of the orbits have shapes that can be identified with one of the four families of regular orbits in stckel potentials ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the situation is very different in triaxial models with divergent central densities , or cusps . while the tube orbits are not strongly affected by cusps , the boxlike orbits ",
    "orbits with stationary points and filled centers  are often rendered stochastic , except when they are associated with a resonant orbit that avoids the center ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "kormendy pointed out already in 1985 that many early - type galaxies and bulges have central brightness profiles that deviate slightly but systematically from that of an isothermal core .",
    "the significance of this deviation was not recognized for ten more years , however , due to an optical illusion associated with projection onto the plane of the sky . a luminosity density profile that varies as @xmath7 at small",
    "radii generates a power - law cusp in projection only if @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath9 , the surface brightness exhibits a curving , logarithmically - divergent central profile ( e.g. @xcite , fig .",
    "1 ) , and for @xmath1 the central surface brightness is finite .",
    "the observed brightness profile of a galaxy like m87 , which has a cusp with @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , differs only subtly from that of a galaxy with an isothermal core ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is true in spite of the fact that the cusp in m87 is well resolved from the ground .",
    "thus even if galaxies were distributed uniformly over @xmath3 , their central brightness profiles would appear to fall into one of two distinct categories : the `` cores '' ( @xmath11 ) and the `` power - laws '' ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "just such a dichotomy was proposed following the first nuclear brightness measurements from hst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "merritt & fridman ( 1995 ) suggested that the centers of _ all _ early - type galaxies , including the core galaxies , might contain power law cusps in the space density .",
    "they used a nonparametric deprojection algorithm to confirm this hypothesis for six galaxies observed with hst .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) subsequently reanalyzed the full sample of 42 early - type galaxies observed by lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and verified the power - law nature of the deprojected cusps in each case .",
    "they also confirmed a tendency , noted earlier by kormendy ( 1985 ) , for the brightest galaxies to have the shallowest cusps .    most of the theoretical work on orbital motion in triaxial potentials has focused on mass models with cores , @xmath12 , or with steep cusps , @xmath13 .",
    "but galaxies with cores probably do not exist ; and only the faintest ellipticals , @xmath14 , have cusps that are predictably as steep as @xmath15 . here",
    "we present the first detailed study of periodic orbits in triaxial models with weak cusps , @xmath16 , characteristic of bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "the value @xmath9 is a natural one for separating `` weak '' from `` strong '' cusps , since a central density that increases more rapidly than @xmath17 implies a divergent central force .",
    "for instance , a spherical galaxy with dehnen s ( 1993 ) density law @xmath18 has a gravitational force @xmath19 dehnen s law , with @xmath13 ( @xcite ) and @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , has been shown to accurately describe the brightness profiles of a number of early - type galaxies .",
    "the triaxial generalization of dehnen s law , @xmath20 @xmath21 was presented by merritt & fridman ( 1996 ) , who derived expressions for the gravitational potential , force and force gradients for @xmath22 .",
    "our primary concern here is with the closed `` boxlets '' , the low - order resonant orbits that act as parents of the boxlike orbits in non - integrable triaxial potentials .",
    "most important is the @xmath2- ( long- ) axis orbit , which generates the box orbits in stckel potentials .",
    "its instability usually occurs through the bifucation of a @xmath23 resonant orbit , or `` banana . ''",
    "( we adopt miralda - escud & schwarzschild s ( 1989 ) scheme for labeling the closed boxlets ; their figure 4 illustrates the different types . )",
    "higher - order resonances produce the `` fish '' ( @xmath24 ) and `` pretzel '' ( @xmath25 ) orbits .",
    "boxlets corresponding to each resonance are expected to exist in all three of the principal planes of a triaxial model , at least at certain energies and for certain values of the model axis ratios .",
    "however little is known about the dependence of boxlet stability on model parameters . in particular ,",
    "the vertical stability of the closed boxlets has been very little explored .    in the present paper , we locate and test the stability of the axial orbits , the bananas , and the fish as a function of the three parameters that define dehnen s models : the cusp slope @xmath3 ; the short - to - long axis ratio @xmath26 ; and the degree of triaxiality , expressed in terms of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to oblate - axisymmetry , and @xmath29 to prolate - axisymmetry . for each set of model parameters , we present results as a function of energy",
    "; thus we explore a four - dimensional parameter space for each of the orbit families .",
    "a total of approximately @xmath30 orbits were investigated .",
    "the numerical scheme for evaluating the stability of the boxlets is presented in  2 .",
    "the results for the axial orbits , the bananas and the fish are presented in  3 , 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "our results are summarized in  6 .",
    "there is increasingly strong evidence for dark mass concentrations , possibly supermassive black holes , at the centers of many early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we ignore the ( possibly substantial ) effect that such singularities would have on the behavior of boxlike orbits : partly because the universality of central black holes has not yet been established ; and partly because the behavior of orbits in triaxial galaxies with cusps provides an essential first step toward understanding the additional effects of a central black hole .",
    "we applied a numerical version of the standard floquet - liapunov theory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to evaluate the stability of the lowest - order periodic orbits in dehnen s model potential .",
    "our approach was similar to that of earlier studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , with one difference . instead of integrating a set of orbits",
    "whose initial conditions were offset by small , finite amounts from those of the closed orbit , we integrated the linearized equations corresponding to a set of infinitesimal perturbations about the closed orbit .",
    "our results are therefore strictly independent of the numerical amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "let @xmath31 , @xmath32 be the parametric representation of a closed orbit .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath33 a nearby orbit has coordinates @xmath34 , @xmath35 . for small @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the equations of motion are @xmath38 subtracting equations ( [ motion ] ) from equations ( [ linmotion ] ) , we have @xmath39 or @xmath40 the second derivatives of the potential , @xmath41 , are taken along the closed orbit whose period is @xmath42 .",
    "expressions for the @xmath41 are given by merritt & fridman ( 1996 ) .",
    "the stability of the closed orbit is then determined by the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath36 has been redefined to include velocities .",
    "we computed the elements of @xmath43 by numerically integrating the six linearized equations of motion ( [ matrix ] ) , starting from unit perturbations in each of the coordinates . a 7/8th order , variable timestep integrator  the routine dopri8 of hairer et al .",
    "( 1987 )  was used .",
    "initial conditions for the non - axial closed orbits were found by an iterative newton method , and precise orbital periods were calculated using the scheme of hnon ( 1982 ) .",
    "two of the eigenvalues of @xmath43 are guaranteed to be unity ; these correspond to eigenvectors lying along the closed orbit .",
    "the remaining four eigenvalues satisfy @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; the stability of the closed orbit is determined by the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 denoting instability ( @xcite ) . for orbits that lie in a symmetry plane , @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspond to perturbations in the orbital plane and perpendicular to the orbital plane , or vice versa . for the simplest orbits , the full set of six perturbation equations",
    "is not required ; for instance , the stability of the axial orbits can be evaluated using just four independent perturbations .",
    "axial orbits presented one complication , however .",
    "while the gravitational force @xmath52 is everywhere finite in dehnen models with @xmath1 , the second derivatives of the potential diverge at the origin as @xmath53 , @xmath45 , etc .",
    "integrations using an algorithm based on finite - amplitude perturbations were carried out for some orbits and compared to the results of the linearized code .",
    "finally , numerical surfaces of section were constructed for a few models and compared to the results from the stability calculations .",
    "all orbits in a given model were assigned energies from a discrete grid , consisting of 20 energy values that corresponded to the values of the potential on the @xmath2-axis of a set of ellipsoidal shells  with the same axis ratios as the density  that divide the model into 21 sections of equal mass .",
    "thus , shell 1 encloses @xmath54 of the total mass , shell 2 encloses @xmath55 , etc .",
    "henceforth units are adopted such that @xmath56 .",
    "the long- ( @xmath2- ) axis orbit is stable at all energies in integrable triaxial potentials and acts as the parent of the box orbits ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in more general triaxial potentials , like",
    "the ones considered here , the @xmath2-axis orbit becomes unstable at high energies when its frequency of oscillation falls to @xmath57 the average oscillation frequency of a perturbation in the direction of the short or intermediate axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "a bifurcation then occurs , with the @xmath23 @xmath4 or @xmath5 banana orbit branching off .",
    "a similar bifurcation occurs from the intermediate ( @xmath58- ) axis orbit , producing the @xmath6 banana .",
    "nearer the center , the @xmath58- and @xmath59-axis orbits become unstable at the bifurcation points of the @xmath60 loop orbits . in models with a harmonic core ,",
    "the loop orbits first appear just outside of the core ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath5 loop is the parent of the short - axis tubes , and the @xmath6 loop is the parent of the long - axis tubes .",
    "the @xmath4 loop is generally unstable and generates no families of regular orbits ( @xcite ) . in models without cores , the loops and their associated tube orbits",
    "may exist all the way into the center .",
    "figures 1 and 2 display the stability diagrams for the @xmath2- and @xmath58- axis orbits in dehnen s potential , for three values of @xmath61 and four values of @xmath3 ; a total of 4104 orbits are displayed in each figure .",
    "four cases are distinguished : stability ( @xmath62 ) ; instability in the direction of the longer ( @xmath63 ) or shorter ( @xmath64 ) of the two remaining axes ; and instability in both directions ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the @xmath2-axis orbit is stable at low energies in all models that are not too highly elongated .",
    "as @xmath3 increases above zero , the range of model shapes for which the @xmath2-axis orbit is stable to the @xmath4 banana bifurcation becomes narrower , eventually including only nearly spherical models ( figure 3 ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath66 , the @xmath2-axis orbit is stable at the half - mass radius for @xmath67 .",
    "thus , bona - fide box orbits ( which require for their existence a stable long - axis orbit ) will occur at a wide range of energies only in models that are nearly spherical , that have very weak cusps , or both .",
    "figure 4 illustrates how the bifurcation of the @xmath4 banana orbit takes place at successively lower energies as @xmath3 is increased .    as @xmath26",
    "is decreased still more , a second @xmath23 bifurcation from the @xmath2-axis orbit sometimes occurs in the direction of the intermediate axis , giving rise to the @xmath5 bananas . following this bifurcation , the @xmath2-axis orbit is unstable in both directions .",
    "as figure 1 shows , the @xmath5 banana bifurcation occurs most readily in nearly prolate models ( e.g. @xmath68 ) in which the @xmath58 and @xmath59 axes are nearly equal in length . for nearly oblate models , e.g. @xmath69 , the @xmath2 and @xmath58 axes are too similar in length for the @xmath5 frequency ratio to ever reach the required value of @xmath23 , and",
    "the @xmath5 banana does not appear .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath2-axis orbit can again become stable when @xmath26 is made smaller still  typically less than about 0.45 .",
    "the return to stability coincides with the appearance of the @xmath4 `` anti - banana '' orbit , a @xmath23 resonant orbit that passes through the center ( @xcite ) . in nearly oblate models ,",
    "this return to stability in the @xmath4 plane causes the @xmath2-axis orbit to become stable in both directions , at least over a limited range in energy and in @xmath26 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the axial orbit becomes unstable once again at still lower values of @xmath26 , through the appearance of a @xmath70 resonance in the direction of the @xmath59 axis ( figure 5 ) . in nearly prolate models , where the @xmath2-axis orbit is also unstable to perturbations in the @xmath5 plane ,",
    "the appearance of the @xmath4 anti - banana orbit leaves the @xmath2-axis orbit still unstable to perturbations in the @xmath58 direction ( figure 1 ) .    at very low values of @xmath26 ,",
    "the stability of the @xmath2-axis orbit varies in a rapid and complex manner with energy and with @xmath3 , as resonances of higher and higher order occur .",
    "the @xmath58-axis orbit ( figure 2 ) is unstable at almost all energies in the full range of models investigated here .",
    "instability in the @xmath2-direction is expected due to the @xmath60 resonance that generates the @xmath5 loops ; these orbits  and their associated family , the short - axis tubes  are present almost universally in dehnen s models .",
    "as @xmath26 decreases , the @xmath58-axis orbit also becomes unstable through the @xmath23 bifurcation that produces the @xmath6 bananas ; the @xmath58-axis orbit is then unstable in both directions . at still greater model elongations ,",
    "the @xmath58-axis orbit returns briefly to stability in the @xmath59-direction through the appearance of the @xmath6 anti - banana .",
    "the stability diagram of the @xmath59-axis orbit is not given here .",
    "this orbit was found to be unstable to perturbations in both the @xmath2- and @xmath58-directions for almost all values of the model parameters , due to the @xmath60 bifurcations that produce the @xmath4 and @xmath6 loops ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the long - axis tube orbits  which are parented by the @xmath6 loop orbits  are almost always present in these models .",
    "the only exceptions occur at low energies in models with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where the ratio of oscillation frequencies in the @xmath59- and @xmath2-directions is too great for the @xmath60 resonance to occur .",
    "the @xmath59-axis orbit is not the parent of any banana family .    in summary :",
    "only the @xmath2-axis orbit is stable over an appreciable range of model parameters .",
    "instability first appears through the @xmath4 banana bifurcation , which occurs at progressively larger values of @xmath26 as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "the @xmath2-axis orbit returns to stability for a narrow range of @xmath26 values , typically around @xmath73 , through the bifurcation of the @xmath4 anti - banana .",
    "banana orbits first appear as @xmath23 bifurcations from the @xmath2-axis orbit ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 bananas ) or the @xmath58-axis orbit ( @xmath6 banana ) .",
    "stability diagrams for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bananas are shown in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "once these orbits bifurcate from the axial orbits , they continue to exist ( though not always stably ) at all higher energies and all lower values of @xmath26 , for any given value of @xmath3 and @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath4 banana exists and is stable over the widest range of model parameters ( figure 6 ) .",
    "it becomes unstable only in nearly - prolate models , through a vertical @xmath23 bifurcation ; for example , when @xmath68 , instability first occurs when @xmath26 drops below @xmath74 .",
    "thus , in virtually all models with axis ratios comparable to those of real elliptical galaxies , either the @xmath2-axis orbit or the @xmath4 banana orbit is stable and can act as the parent of a family of regular boxlets .",
    "the @xmath5 banana exists only in relatively prolate and elongated models , in which the @xmath5 frequency ratio can exceed @xmath23 ( figure 7 ) . for moderate values of @xmath26 , however , the @xmath5 banana is generally vertically unstable ; its instability follows closely that of the @xmath75axis orbit in the @xmath59-direction ( figure 1 ) . for smaller values of @xmath26 , e.g. @xmath76 for @xmath68 , the @xmath5 banana returns to stability via a @xmath23 bifurcation at approximately the same model parameters where the @xmath75axis orbit also becomes stable in the @xmath77direction ( figure 8) .",
    "the @xmath6 banana was found to be almost universally unstable in the vertical ( @xmath2 ) direction , mimicking the @xmath2-instability of the @xmath58-axis orbit .",
    "the regular orbits associated with the @xmath4 bananas are known to be heavily populated in self - consistent triaxial models with cusps ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however their usefulness is limited by the fact that the banana orbits become more strongly curved as @xmath26 decreases , so that in sufficiently elongated models , the boxlets associated with the @xmath4 bananas are all rounder than the model figure .",
    "figure 9 shows the value of @xmath26 at which the @xmath4 banana has an elongation  defined as @xmath78 , the ratio of its extent in the @xmath59 and @xmath2 directions  that just matches that of the model .",
    "figure 9 suggests that the boxlets associated with the @xmath4 banana will be useful in reconstructing triaxial models for @xmath79 .    in summary :",
    "the @xmath4 banana exists and is stable for the widest range of model parameters .",
    "it is slender enough to match the shape of the model when @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bananas either do not exist , or are vertically unstable , in all models with moderate values of @xmath26 ; the @xmath5 banana returns to stability only in highly elongated , nearly prolate models .",
    "fish orbits first appear as @xmath24 bifurcations from the @xmath2-axis orbit ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 fish ) or the @xmath58-axis orbit ( @xmath6 fish ) .",
    "stability diagrams for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 fish are shown in figures 10 and 11 .",
    "once these orbits bifurcate from the axial orbits , they continue to exist at all higher energies and all lower values of @xmath26 , for any given value of @xmath3 and @xmath61 .    the @xmath4 fish exists and is stable in models with moderate values of @xmath26 ( figure 10 ) . in nearly oblate models ,",
    "the @xmath4 fish first becomes unstable to perturbations in the orbital plane , while for strongly triaxial and prolate models , instability first appears in the vertical ( @xmath58 ) direction ( figure 12 ) .",
    "however this orbit exists stably over a substantially narrower range of model parameters than the @xmath4 banana .",
    "the @xmath5 fish is only important in strongly prolate models ( figure 11 ) . in strongly triaxial and oblate models ,",
    "it either does not exist , or is generally unstable to vertical ( @xmath59 ) perturbations .",
    "the @xmath6 fish was found to be unstable to vertical perturbations for almost all values of the model parameters .    in summary :",
    "the @xmath4 fish is important in moderately flattened , oblate / triaxial models , while the the @xmath5 fish is important in highly prolate models . in strongly triaxial models , instability in both families first occurs in the vertical direction .",
    "neither orbit exists stably for as wide a range of model parameters as the @xmath4 banana .",
    "our results highlight the sensitivity of boxlike orbits to small changes in the central density structure of a triaxial galaxy .",
    "the range of model shapes for which the @xmath2-axis orbit  the progenitor of the box orbits  is stable becomes rapidly narrower as the cusp slope @xmath3 approaches one . for @xmath81 , only triaxial models with moderate axis ratios , @xmath82 , contain stable long - axis orbits at most energies .",
    "regular box orbits may nevertheless be present in the majority of bright elliptical galaxies , since the distribution of intrinsic shapes of these galaxies is strongly peaked at @xmath83 ( @xcite ) , and many ellipticals have cusp slopes @xmath84 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    of the remaining families of boxlets investigated here ,",
    "those lying in the @xmath4 plane were found to be most important , in the sense that they exist and are stable in models with the widest variety of cusp slopes and axis ratios . in particular , the @xmath4 bananas are unstable only in highly flattened , nearly prolate models , and they are often more elongated than the model figure , making them useful building - blocks for a self - consistent galaxy .",
    "the boxlets in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 planes are almost always vertically unstable in strongly triaxial models ( when they exist ) , and it seems unlikely that they could play an important role in maintaining triaxiality in real galaxies .",
    "we have investigated only motion in the principal planes . other resonant orbits  although generally of a higher order  exist outside of the principal planes .",
    "merritt & fridman ( 1996 ) cataloged the orbits in a single triaxial model with dehnen s density law , @xmath9 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "their figure 4 confirms that only the @xmath4 banana and the @xmath4 fish , among the closed boxlets investigated here , are generators of regular orbit families .",
    "the @xmath5 pretzel was also found to be important at low energies , as were a number of higher - order resonances outside of the principal planes , including the @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 closed boxlets .",
    "although instability does not imply stochasticity , unstable resonant orbits are often associated with chaos .",
    "we expect that the phase space surrounding many of the unstable boxlets is stochastic .",
    "however , the timescale over which the stochasticity manifests itself in the orbital motion is likely to be a strong function of the model parameters , particularly the cusp slope @xmath3 and the energy .",
    "we will return to this question in a future study .",
