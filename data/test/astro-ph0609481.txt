    "the goal of cosmology is to describe the evolution history of the universe as a whole , tracing it as far back as possible from the present epoch .",
    "this seemingly daunting task is made tractable by the fact that the observed matter density in the universe appears to be approximately homogeneous when viewed on the largest scales .",
    "further , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation reveal it to be isotropic ( after subtracting a dipole contribution due to our local motion ) down to the level of one part in @xmath0 .",
    "the twin conditions of homogeneity and isotropy , if valid on all length scales , would immensely simplify the form of the metric and matter tensors used in the general relativistic description of cosmology .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that on purely geometric grounds , the most general metric describing a homogeneous and isotropic universe takes on the form of the friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) line element .",
    "the standard method of proceeding is to assume that the geometry of the universe can be described by a background metric with small perturbations , where the background is exactly homogeneous and isotropic and is hence of the flrw form .",
    "( for a detailed discussion of the assumptions involved in the standard cosmology , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )    this approach is adopted not only for the early universe , for example in describing big bang nucleosynthesis and the dynamics of the cmb anisotropies , but is also assumed to be valid at recent epochs . in particular ,",
    "the luminosity distances constructed to compare data from type ia supernovae ( sne ) with theory , assume a metric of the flrw form with its dynamics given by the einstein equations for a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "we know , however , that the matter content of the universe today is _ not _ homogeneous on small scales - one finds inhomogeneity at the scale of individual galaxies for example ; and there is evidence @xcite that voids of order @xmath1 mpc is the conventional parameter which appears in the definition of the hubble constant @xmath2 kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 . ] in diameter account for @xmath4-@xmath5 of the observed universe .",
    "there is also evidence for voids 3 - 5 times this size @xcite , as well as local voids on smaller scales @xcite .",
    "the evidence for homogeneity of the matter distribution in the universe only appears at scales larger than about @xmath6 mpc or so @xcite .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume that the metric describing our universe must also reflect the inhomogeneity of the matter on the corresponding scales .",
    "one may now ask whether it is at all justified to use the luminosity distances constructed using the flrw metric with its associated dynamics to compare theory with observational data from sne . in this paper we argue that the use of such luminosity distances is indeed justified , provided we are only interested in using such constructions in probing length scales larger than a certain minimum scale which is fixed by requiring that the assumption of homogeneity be valid ( a lower bound on such a scale could be @xmath6 mpc for example ) .",
    "more importantly , we propose that the _ dynamics _ of this ( effective or template ) macroscopic metric must be governed not by the standard einstein equations applied to the flrw metric , but by the effective equations obtained after spatial averaging on constant time slices , as developed by buchert @xcite .",
    "an outstanding open issue has been the following : how does one compare the predictions of the inhomogeneous , spatially averaged cosmology with observations , and should one be attempting an interpretation in terms of spatially averaged variables in the first place ?",
    "for instance , one could study light propagation and determine the luminosity distance versus redshift ( @xmath7 ) relation which best fits the observations , within an _ inhomogeneous _ model of the universe .",
    "following the important and interesting early work of dyer and roeder , where the angular - size and luminosity distances were obtained for beams propagating in `` lumpy '' flrw universes @xcite , detailed investigations have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "such a program has also received considerable attention in the context of the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) models @xcite . however , it is not clear to us that this is necessarily the best way to proceed , at least as far as distant sne are concerned .",
    "a realistic computation of light propagation in an inhomogeneous geometry seems difficult at best , and while the use of simplified toy models such as the ltb solutions in this endeavor may be justified on the grounds that we may inhabit a locally underdense region @xcite , it is not clear that the assumptions justifying the use of the toy model remain valid at large scales ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of the ltb approach ) . and",
    "after all , the concordance model infers the presence of a dark energy by comparing the predictions of the standard homogeneous and isotropic flrw cosmology against observations @xcite . if one decides to interpret the flrw cosmology as a template against which observations",
    "may be compared , then in order to decide whether cosmic inhomogeneities could be an alternative to the concordance model , one must construct a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , after a suitable smoothing procedure , and compare its predictions with observations such as the @xmath7  relation for type ia sne .",
    "one should note that the effects of averaging within the standard perturbed flrw framework of cosmology , have been studied by several authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and it has been argued that these effects must necessarily be small .",
    "the papers in refs .",
    "@xcite however , do not necessarily address the entire problem .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite deals with only super - horizon fluctuations , whereas work done by others ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) indicates that there may be nontrivial contributions due to averaging from _",
    "_ sub__horizon fluctuations where the matter perturbations have gone nonlinear . and",
    "while the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite construct a cosmological model with negligible effects of averaging , there do exist toy models of inhomogeneous spacetimes in which these effects are large ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    furthermore ,",
    "the possibility of _ nonperturbative _ effects of averaging has not , to our knowledge , been satisfactorily addressed , much less ruled out .",
    "it is important to realize that current @xmath8-body simulations for example , which are based on a newtonian approximation of gravity , consistently miss possible relativistic effects of averaging .",
    "this is because the modifications due to averaging in a newtonian setting can be shown to reduce to boundary terms in general @xcite , and to vanish in the case of spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "these terms therefore do not contribute in simulations which either set periodic boundary conditions on the simulation box , or use a spherically symmetric simulation region . as we will see , the `` backreaction '' effects in buchert s framework ( i.e. , the modifications to the cosmological equations due to averaging ) are coupled to the average of the spatial curvature , this being a completely relativistic effect .",
    "nontrivial consequences of this coupling deserve more attention than they have received in the context of @xmath8-body simulations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    we also note that an argument for describing the universe using flrw plus newtonian perturbations ( e.g. , as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is based on the fact that it is newtonian perturbations _ and _ a negative pressure component , which describe the universe very well .",
    "in other words , one argues that the effect of averaging inhomogeneities must be small , but at the cost of adding an ill - understood dark energy component in the universe . on the other hand",
    "one should allow for the following possibility ( as of now neither confirmed nor ruled out ) : at an initial epoch , say at the end of inflation , the perturbations in the homogeneous metric would give a small `` backreaction '' as a result of averaging . as a result of its coupling with the curvature ,",
    "this backreaction would grow and become significant around the time of structure formation , when matter inhomogeneities on small scales become nonlinear .",
    "the backreaction would also nontrivially affect the growth of the metric perturbations .",
    "such a possibility could only be tested within a fully nonperturbative treatment of the evolution of inhomogeneities .",
    "the goal of this paper is modest .",
    "we argue that the scale factor , defined in the spatially averaged cosmology via the volume of a domain , should correspond to an effective flrw metric , provided the size of the averaging domain coincides with the scale at which cosmological homogeneity arises .",
    "this allows us , in principle , to compare predictions of a spatially averaged cosmology with observations , in the standard manner , for instance by computing the @xmath7  relation .",
    "( however , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative approach to matching the spatially averaged dynamics with observations . )",
    "the predictions of the spatially averaged cosmology would in general differ from standard flrw cosmology , because the scale - factor now obeys modified einstein equations .",
    "we will demonstrate that consistent models of spatially averaged flrw templates exist which can , at least in principle , explain observations such as those of the @xmath7  relation for supernovae .",
    "[ intro ]    in a nutshell , our new results in this paper are that we propose a template metric which takes into account the kinematical effects of inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "to implement this idea , we first suggest that in buchert s spatial averaging scheme , the size of the averaging domain should coincide with the cosmological scale at which homogeneity sets in .",
    "we then argue that , as a first step towards predicting the relation between inhomogeneities and observations , the expansion factor @xmath9 defined by buchert should be identified with the scale - factor @xmath10 in standard flrw cosmology .",
    "the template metric is then the flrw metric , with @xmath9 playing the role of @xmath10 .",
    "we then show , with the help of a few toy examples , that the luminosity distance - redshift relation in a model universe with an accelerating @xmath9 can be computed in the standard manner . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", such a template metric has not been proposed in earlier work by other researchers .",
    "at the length scales of cosmological interest , individual galaxies are small enough to be treated as point - like objects . given the large number ( @xmath11 ) of galaxies estimated to exist in the observed universe , it is also assumed that the matter content of the universe can be described to a good approximation as a continuum fluid . at the level of the matter distribution ,",
    "this picture is comparable to that of a gas composed of a large number of molecules , wherein the internal structure of the molecules can be ignored when dealing with the macroscopic properties of the gas which is treated as a continuum fluid .",
    "further , the complex intermolecular interactions in the gas at the microscopic level can be dealt with in a mean field approximation by considering volume averages of the quantities of interest .",
    "this picture is made precise by introducing the concept of _ physically infinitesimal _",
    "volumes @xcite or _ coarse - graining cells_. the fluid approximation is assumed to be valid provided the ( effectively ) infinitesimal volumes used in defining continuum quantities such as the matter density of the fluid , correspond to _ physical _ volumes which are large enough to contain a very large number of the particles constituting the fluid . at the same time , since these volumes are to be effectively infinitesimal , their physical size must also be much smaller than the scale of the fluid as a whole .",
    "we can then say that the length scales @xmath12 being probed by these physically infinitesimal volumes must lie in a certain range @xmath13 which is determined by the details of the fluid ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "clearly we must satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the size of the system . in the cosmological context",
    ", @xmath15 would be the hubble scale , and in order to deal with homogeneous and isotropic effective descriptions we would also have to satisfy @xmath16 where the homogeneity scale @xmath17 as mentioned earlier can be as large as @xmath6 mpc .",
    "the physical quantities we wish to deal with , such as the matter density , pressure , fluid velocity field , etc . are defined by suitably averaging or _",
    "coarse graining _ over the physically infinitesimal volumes ( hence the terminology of coarse - graining cells ( cgcs ) ) .",
    "for example , the matter density of a given cgc is defined as the mass contained in it divided by its physical volume .",
    "the ( effectively ) continuum matter density is built up by repeating this for every cgc in the fluid .",
    "since we deal with the notion of a continuum fluid in cosmology , clearly we need a working description of coarse graining appropriate in this context . however , the underlying theory being general relativity , there are problems .",
    "the crucial issue is that along with the matter distribution ( which is now tensorial ) , the _ metric _ for the spacetime also needs to be coarse grained . as discussed by ellis @xcite , in defining a smoothing operation to go from the scale of stars ( scale 1 in ellis terminology , _ microscopic _ in ours ) to cosmological scales where homogeneity can be assumed to have set in ( scale 5 for ellis , _ macroscopic _ for us )",
    ", one would employ two logically different smoothing operators , one each on the metric and the matter tensor .",
    "we denote the smoothing operator acting on the metric as @xmath18 and the one acting on the matter tensor as @xmath19 ( our notation differs from that used in ref .",
    "we assume that einstein s equations are valid on the microscopic scale of stars , which is reasonable since it is at these scales that solar system tests and binary pulsar studies probe general relativity .",
    "symbolically then ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the metric @xmath20 at this scale is used to construct the einstein tensor @xmath21 which is equated to the matter tensor @xmath22 , giving einstein s equations @xmath23 .        to obtain the corresponding description at the macroscopic scale , we use the smoothing operators to get a new metric tensor @xmath24 and a matter tensor @xmath25 .",
    "the macroscopic metric @xmath26 is used to construct the einstein tensor @xmath27 at the macroscopic scale .",
    "formally , one can think of the map @xmath18 as inducing a map @xmath28 which acts on the microscopic einstein tensor @xmath21 to yield @xmath29 .",
    "since the operators @xmath28 and @xmath19 are in general different , we have @xmath30 . hence ,",
    "if the einstein equations are valid on a given length scale , then they are in general not valid on some other length scale connected to the first by appropriately defined smoothing operators .",
    "if we can re - express the new einstein tensor @xmath27 in terms of quantities obtained by acting the operator @xmath19 on _ both sides _ of the einstein equations at the microscopic scale , then it should be possible to write @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents corrections to the einstein equations arising from an explicit smoothing . in the standard approach",
    ", it is assumed that these corrections are small enough to be neglected .",
    "( it should be emphasized that given the recent evidence for voids in the universe , one or more additional scales may eventually have to be included in the averaging scheme . )",
    "added to all this is the complication that smoothing or averaging operations are notoriously difficult to define for tensor quantities in a gauge covariant manner .",
    "some examples of averaging techniques employed in general relativity ( and in cosmology in particular ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the formalism developed by buchert @xcite for volume averages of scalar quantities in a given choice of time - slicing . in the following sections we recall this formalism and argue that it is naturally adapted to the notion of the smoothing operator for the _ matter _ sector .",
    "we will reserve the term `` averaging '' for the matter smoothing defined in this way . as for the smoothing of the metric ( which we will refer to as `` coarse graining '' ) , we will take recourse to cosmological observations and argue that the result of such an operation on the inhomogeneous metric must yield the flrw metric on a suitable coarse graining scale .",
    "for simplicity we restrict our attention to a pressure - less fluid or `` dust '' , although a generalization to fluids with non - zero pressure is also possible ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for a general spacetime containing irrotational dust ,",
    "the metric can be written in synchronous and comoving gauge .",
    "] , @xmath33 the expansion tensor @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where the dot refers to a derivative with respect to ( proper ) time @xmath36 .",
    "the traceless symmetric shear tensor is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the expansion scalar .",
    "the einstein equations can be split @xcite into a set of scalar equations and a set of vector and traceless tensor equations .",
    "the scalar equations are the hamiltonian constraint and the evolution equation for @xmath39 ,    @xmath40    @xmath41    [ avg2 ]    where @xmath42 is the ricci scalar of the 3-dimensional hypersurface of constant @xmath36 , @xmath43 is the rate of shear defined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the matter density of the dust .",

    "spatial averaging is , by definition , not generally covariant .",
    "thus the choice of foliation is relevant , and should be motivated on physical grounds . in the context of cosmology , averaging over freely - falling observers is a natural choice , especially when one intends to compare the results with standard flrw cosmology .",

    "the averager defined in eqn . is a natural candidate for the smoothing operator @xmath67 which must act on the matter tensor , although we have not yet specified the domain size .",
    "note that this averaging is defined on an inhomogeneous underlying geometry , i.e. it does not smoothen out the geometry itself .",
    "it remains to determine the operator @xmath18 that will coarse grain the metric .",
    "although we do not have an explicit definition for this operator , we can define a notional smoothing operator acting on the metric , by using physical inputs from the universe we observe .",
    "namely , we propose that since the universe has a matter content which is homogeneous on large scales , and since the cmb is highly isotropic around us , this notional operator must reflect these observations by acting on the general metric of eqn . to yield a flrw metric .",
    "crucially , the _ scale factor _ of this flrw metric must ( within our assumptions ) be given by buchert s functional @xmath68 , where the domain size to be used will be specified shortly .",
    "the argument leading to this proposal is as follows .",
    "we begin by making precise the notion of `` homogeneity on large scales '' , by requiring that in the range @xmath69 of cgc sizes allowed by the fluid approximation validity criterion , there exist a subset @xmath70 satisfying the following condition : when the microscopic matter density @xmath71 is averaged over a length scale @xmath72 , the resulting smoothed density _ must lose all information _ about the particular cgc over which the smoothing was performed .",
    "in other words , for @xmath72 , at any given time @xmath36 , the smoothed matter density must have the _ same _ value in all cgcs .",
    "it is in this sense that the smoothed matter density is homogeneous ( see however , the discussion at the end of this section concerning an explicit smoothing of the metric ) .",
    "this definition can be related to the concept of _ statistical _ homogeneity if we assume that the total volume of the observable universe is large enough that each cgc effectively samples one of an ensemble of configurations of matter distribution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a careful discussion of this point ) .",
    "it is possible that homogeneity sets in at a scale too large to be considered as the size of the cgcs , namely that the range @xmath73 is not contained in the range @xmath74 and that @xmath75 is not satisfied .",
    "we will assume that this does not happen ( for a more detailed discussion on this assumption , see sec .",
    "2.1 of ref .",
    "we also make the crucial assumption that @xmath73 does not change with time . this will later allow us to consistently analyze light propagation using the effective flrw metric .",
    "this assumption needs some justification and we will return to this issue in the discussion .",
    "now define a coarse - graining cell to be an averaging domain @xmath50as used in buchert s formalism , with a characteristic comoving size @xmath72 .",
    "the averaged density is then @xmath76 , independent of the location of the particular cgc being considered .",
    "it also follows that the averaged expansion scalar @xmath77 is homogeneous in the above sense ( using eqn . ) and describes the evolution of the physical volume of any given cgc .",
    "thus , @xmath78 plays the role of the expansion scalar for a geometry whose infinitesimal spatial volume elements probe length scales of the size of our cgcs ( see however the discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to demand that @xmath78 be the expansion scalar for our notionally smoothed out macroscopic metric .",
    "this is equivalent to demanding that the scale factor of this homogeneous and isotropic effective metric be identified with the functional @xmath68 ( up to a constant factor which we choose to be unity by an appropriate choice of units for the effective comoving coordinates ) .",
    "we are thus left with an effective metric whose line element can be written as @xmath79 which probes comoving length scales of size @xmath12 as chosen above .",
    "the 3-ricci scalar of this effective metric is given by @xmath80 and should be thought of as arising from the coarse graining of the geometry .",
    "following ellis ideas from sec .",
    "[ cgcpic ] then , @xmath81 is in general different from the averaged 3-ricci scalar @xmath63 which arises from applying the matter averager to the inhomogeneous scalar curvature ( @xmath82 ) . the constant @xmath83 has the usual interpretation as a parameter characterizing all possible homogeneous and isotropic 3-metrics",
    ". we can write @xmath84  in terms of @xmath85 by defining @xmath86 .",
    "so we are merely shifting focus from ( the _ a priori _ unknown ) @xmath84  to another unknown @xmath87 .",
    "as the notation suggests , we think of @xmath87  as being a correction ( a part of @xmath32 in the notation of sec .",
    "[ cgcpic ] , see eqns . below ) to the 3-ricci scalar of the flrw metric , although this correction need not be small compared to @xmath85 and need not evolve proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "we choose not to normalize the magnitude of the constant @xmath89 , retaining instead the normalization of the functional @xmath68 at the initial time @xmath59 .",
    "the evolution equations appropriate at this scale are buchert s equations and together with the integrability condition . for completeness , and in the spirit of ellis arguments we can rewrite equations and as follows    @xmath90    [ smop2 ]    where we have symbolically denoted the specific components of the general modified equations to which the various terms of buchert s equations belong .",
    "the integrability condition which supplements these equations is purely a consequence of having non - zero corrections @xmath32 to the standard flrw equations . as a quick check",
    ", we note that requiring the corrections @xmath32 to vanish implies both @xmath91 ( from eqn . ) and @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath93 ( from eqn . ) ; the integrability condition is identically satisfied and we recover the usual flrw solution .    in the arguments leading to eqns .",
    ", we have ignored the effects of a virtual _ change _ in the averaging length scale @xmath12 .",
    "considerable effort has been spent by buchert and carfora @xcite in studying such effects . in particular , in the spirit of the real space renormalization group formalism",
    ", these authors derive a novel _ curvature backreaction _",
    "effect analogous to the kinematical backreaction @xmath94 , together with a volume scaling effect .",
    "the inclusion of these effects would change the evolution equations satisfied by the scale factor @xmath95 .",
    "we also note that buchert and carfora s techniques ( involving ricci flow of the inhomogeneous geometry into a smooth geometry ) form one candidate for an explicit realization of the metric coarse graining operator @xmath18 .",
    "seen in this light , it is apparent that by accounting for the above effects , we would also have to appropriately modify our notion of large scale homogeneity ( to include the volume scaling effect and the residual information from the curvature fluctuations ) . in the arguments leading to the effective metric , the scale factor @xmath95",
    "would be replaced by an appropriately `` dressed '' quantity characterizing the evolution of effectively infinitesimal volumes in the smoothed geometry .",
    "however , the main arguments leading to an effective metric which is flrw , will not be altered given the existence of the range @xmath96 .",
    "for simplicity , we ignore these additional effects in this paper , and hope to investigate them in future work .",
    "it should be noted that a notion of coarse - graining is always implicit in standard flrw cosmology .",
    "it is assumed that a coarse - graining ( while satisfying the conditions of the fluid approximation ) is possible on a length scale which coincides with the scale at which homogeneity is achieved ( in other words , the existence of @xmath96 is assumed ) .",
    "standard cosmology however ignores the possible modifications to flrw cosmology brought about by the process of explicitly smoothing over the inhomogeneities - an issue which buchert s approach addresses .",
    "our key proposal in this paper is that the size of the averaging domain should be taken to coincide with the scale of homogeneity , and that ( up to some corrections ) the quantity @xmath68 corresponds to the scale factor of a template flrw metric .",
    "we now illustrate how our proposal can facilitate the comparison of the predictions of the spatially averaged cosmology with observations , for example by computing the @xmath7  relation using the scale factor @xmath68 , which has a modified time evolution compared to the corresponding scale factor in standard cosmology .",
    "in our approach , we take the effective or template metric to be flrw , and since we are holding the size @xmath12 of the averaging domain fixed , there is nothing conceptually new to be done while studying its null geodesics . the important difference , of course , is that the evolution of the scale factor is now given by the modified friedmann equations ( subject to the caveats listed at the end of the previous section ) .",
    "we note that the use of the flrw metric is , strictly speaking `` unrealistic '' in the sense that in the real universe , light travels mostly in vacuum which has a non - zero weyl tensor whereas in the flrw cosmologies which are conformally flat , light travels through a geometry with vanishing weyl tensor ( see also refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this issue is clearly relevant in the standard approach as well .",
    "while we have not addressed this issue in the context of averaging , we emphasize that our approach must be thought of as a first step in gauging the effects of inhomogeneities , by using an _ explicitly _ averaged construction of the template flrw model to be used .",
    "the arguments relating the redshift of a source to the scale factor @xmath95  and to its comoving distance @xmath97 from the observer , are exactly the same as in the standard approach . in particular",

    "@xmath99 , @xmath101 and the comoving distance @xmath97 to the source is determined by solving the equation @xmath102 a caveat to the above relations is that the `` step - size '' used in computing the integrals involved must be understood to be no smaller than the size @xmath12 of the cgcs .",
    "further , the entire construction must be interpreted as a `` fitting template '' that allows us to compare observations with theoretical predictions in a straight forward manner . with our choice of conventions ,",

    "this requirement is complicated by the fact that the system of equations , , and is only consistent , it does not close . in order to obtain the required relation",

    "further , since @xmath158 , we have @xmath167 . defining @xmath168 and noting that @xmath169 and @xmath170 , we get @xmath171^{1/2 } } }    \\ , .",

    "the acceleration redshift is @xmath180 . for comparison",
    "we also show the @xmath7  curve in the standard lcdm model with @xmath181 and @xmath182 , for which the acceleration redshift is @xmath183 .",
    "[ interestingly , a model in which the backreaction @xmath64 behaves as @xmath184 at early times , has recently been studied by li and schwarz @xcite in the context of spatial averaging of a perturbed flrw cosmological model . ]",
    "+   + we have therefore demonstrated the existence of models of the backreaction which can admit an accelerating scale factor .",
    "it is important to keep in mind though , that the models considered above were not physically well - motivated , they served only to demonstrate the construction of luminosity distances using the modified dynamics .",
    "a more realistic scenario would probably contain a backreaction which becomes significant only at late times , when structure formation has advanced sufficiently far .",
    "it will be an interesting exercise to numerically construct luminosity distances for such models and compare them with those of the concordance model .",
    "we have argued that for the purposes of cosmological study , an explicit coarse graining of the matter density in the universe must be performed using the formalism of spatial averaging developed by buchert . due to the observed large scale homogeneity of the matter density and the isotropy of the cmb radiation ,",
    "the notionally smoothed out template metric obtained after this coarse graining must be described by a flrw line element , with the scale factor being given by buchert s functional @xmath68 .",
    "the procedure for constructing luminosity distances is therefore identical to that in the standard approach , except that the _ evolution _ of the effective scale factor must be given by the modified flrw equations supplemented by the integrability condition .",
    "( the scale factor and its evolution will be further modified by including perfect fluid sources with non - zero pressure @xcite and the curvature backreaction and volume effects @xcite . )",
    "such a construction of luminosity distances must be interpreted as a convenient way of comparing observations with theoretical models , while retaining the essence of the physical inhomogeneous geometry .",
    "it will be an interesting project to compare such luminosity distances in realistic backreaction scenarios with current supernovae observations in an attempt to constrain the magnitude and evolution of the backreaction .",
    "we end by discussing some additional issues concerning an explicit smoothing of the metric which we avoided in the present treatment , and also some potential problems with our construction .",
    "firstly , we return to the issue of holding the comoving range @xmath73 , and in particular the smoothing scale @xmath12 , constant .",
    "this is justified only so long as the condition @xmath185 is satisfied , where @xmath186 is the appropriate comoving scale associated with the observable universe at redshift @xmath98 . for example , if we choose a scale @xmath12 which satisfies this condition at the present epoch , the same scale will not in general be valid at the last scattering epoch of the cmb .",
    "however , it seems reasonable that for a small enough redshift range , the condition @xmath187 can be satisfied with a single constant @xmath12 .",
    "for epochs sufficiently far back in the past , the scale @xmath12 would have to be reduced , and the construction of the @xmath7  relation would no longer be valid .",
    "further , a change in the size of the averaging domain would in general affect both the scale factor @xmath95  and the `` constant '' @xmath89  in a non - trivial way .",
    "in particular , any change in @xmath89  would render the effective flrw metric meaningless .",
    "also , a change in @xmath89  need not necessarily be caused by a change in the averaging domain size .",
    "it seems likely @xcite that an explicit smoothing of the geometry using buchert and carfora s technique will yield a 3-space of different spatially constant curvatures at different times , this difference being independent of any change in the averaging domain size with time and being possibly incommensurate with our assumption of @xmath188 .",
    "this could be interpreted in terms of a change in @xmath89  with time , and in such a case , one would be dealing with a _ different _ flrw template at different times .",
    "the effects of such a construction are not clear at present",
    ". clearly this issue needs more careful study , and we hope to address this in the future .",
    "of course , if @xmath89  is made a function of time , care must be taken that the matter content is now so chosen that einstein s equations continue to be satisfied , as pointed out by rsnen @xcite in response to @xcite .",
    "also , as pointed out by rsnen @xcite , the use of a homogeneous and isotropic flrw template will necessarily ignore physical effects such as a non - trivial shear in the underlying geometry .",
    "a potential problem with our template construction is that effects of the non - trivial scalar curvature @xmath189 on light propagation are also simplified to a proportionality to @xmath88 .",
    "although the full scalar curvature will show up in the evolution of @xmath68 via its spatial average @xmath84 , it is possible that this construction may inaccurately model the real universe .",
    "a study of the evolution of the effective spatial curvature as mentioned in the preceding paragraph may help resolve this issue .",
    "there is also the related issue of degeneracy , namely that several underlying inhomogeneous models may reproduce the same backreaction effects when averaged .",
    "for example , it was shown @xcite in the context of the ltb solutions , that models with a vanishing spatial curvature ( the so called marginally bound models ) in the inhomogeneous geometry also have a vanishing backreaction @xmath94 after averaging .",
    "one is now faced with the situation wherein interpreting say luminosity distance observations within the inhomogeneous geometry may distinguish two inhomogeneous models , but interpreting the data _ after _ averaging would not make this distinction and would hence perhaps rule out _ both _ models .",
    "this issue has been recently highlighted by enqvist and mattsson ( the last paper in ref .",
    "@xcite ) who show that a marginally bound ltb model can fit the data from type ia sne without any spatial averaging . since the standard flrw matter dominated model is also ( a special , homogeneous case of ) a marginal ltb model which _ does nt _ fit the sne data @xcite , the formalism after spatial averaging would rule out both models by demanding a non - trivial backreaction instead . however , since the ltb ( and in fact any inhomogeneous ) models themselves face a similar degeneracy issue ( for example several different ltb models can currently claim to fit the sne data @xcite ) , this matter can not be considered as settled , and also deserves further attention .",
    "lastly , we note that buchert s averaging scheme itself has been criticized in the literature ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) on the grounds that the effects of averaging in a noncovariant manner as done in this scheme , are likely to be gauge artifacts .",
    "it should be noted that within second - order perturbation theory , gauge invariance of the averaged equations has been demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to approach the problem of determining modifications to the standard cosmological equations via a covariant method such as zalaletdinov s macroscopic gravity @xcite for example .",
    "such an attempt has in fact been made recently and has led to effective cosmological equations very similar to those of buchert ( see ref .",
    "the proposal in the present paper however , is attractive to us due to its simplicity in implementation , and may be treated as a phenomenological model of the more rigorous equations derived in ref .",
