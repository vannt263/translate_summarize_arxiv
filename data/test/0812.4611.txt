    "one interesting phenomenon occurring in ultracold atomic gases trapped in periodic potentials is the possibility to localize matter in states which can stay for a long time due to an interplay between nonlinearity , dispersion and periodicity .",
    "such states ( also called gap - solitons ) have been observed in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) and in arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite . for attractive atomic interactions in bec and in absence of a periodic potential , stable localized solutions are possible only in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting since in two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensions the phenomenon of collapse appears @xcite .",
    "more precisely , one observes that when the number of atoms exceeds a critical threshold , the solution collapses in a finite time ( blow - up ) while for number of atoms below the critical threshold there is an irreversible decay of the state into background radiation .",
    "for the higher dimensional nonlinear schdinger ( nls ) equation , however , it is known that there exists an unstable localized solution , the so called townes soliton @xcite , which separates decaying solutions from collapsing ones .",
    "townes soliton , however , exists only for a single value of the number of atoms , being unstable against fluctuations around it ( for slightly overcritical or undercritical number of atoms the solution collapses or decays , respectively ) .",
    "the situation is drastically changed in presence of an optical lattice ( ol ) . to this regard",
    ", it has been shown that stable 2d and 3d solitons can exists in ols both in bec and nonlinear optics contexts @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known that while the periodic potential can only marginally shift the critical value for collapse , it can substantially move the delocalizing transition curve , thereby increasing the soliton existence range in parameter space from a single point to a whole interval @xcite .",
    "the typical situation with 2d and 3d bec solitons in ols is therefore the following : in the parameter space the stable localized solutions are confined from above by the collapse curve and from below by the delocalizing transition curve , thus , in contrast with the one dimensional case where there are no limits for the existence of localized states , strict limitations for soliton existence appear in multidimensional cases . from this point of view",
    "it is clear that for possible experimental observation of multidimensional bec solitons the parameter design becomes very important .",
    "since the collapse curve is only marginally affected by the periodic potential , to enlarge existence ranges of solitons it is of interest to give a full characterization of the delocalizing curve in parameter space .",
    "the aim of this paper is just devoted to this , i.e. we characterize 2d and 3d delocalizing curves of gap - solitons in terms of an unstable solution of the multidimensional gross - pitaeviskii equation ( gpe ) , which we call gap - townes soliton",
    ". this solution can be viewed as a separatrix ( it separates gap soliton states from extended ( bloch ) states ) and reduces to the known townes soliton when the strength of the ol goes to zero .",
    "similar solutions were found also for the 1d nls equation with higher order nonlinearities in @xcite , where they were called gap - townes solitons , and in @xcite where they were termed townes solitons .",
    "conditions for the occurrence of the delocalizing transition phenomenon of one - dimensional localized modes of several nonlinear continuous periodic and discrete systems of the nonlinear schrdinger type were also recently discussed in @xcite . for the periodic multidimensional gpe",
    "the delocalizing curve has been characterized in @xcite as the critical threshold for the existence of one bound state in an effective potential .",
    "the characterization given here , however , is more general since it is valid also for 1d nls with higher order nonlinearities . to this",
    "regard we remark that in absence of confining potential the 2d and 3d gpe behaves similarly to the 1d nls with quintic and septic nonlinearities , respectively .",
    "the interplay between dimensionality and nonlinearity has been used to investigate collapse in lower dimensional nls on the basis of pure dimensional arguments . in particular , the critical condition for collapse has been characterized as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the order of the nonlinearity in the equation and @xmath2 is the dimensionality of the system @xcite . in the following",
    "we take advantage of this interplay to construct approximate gap - townes soliton solutions of the gpe with multidimensional separable ols , in terms of products of exact gap - townes solutions of the 1d nls with higher nonlinearities . remarkably , we find that , except for strengths of the optical lattices very small , our approach produces very accurate gap - townes solutions of multidimensional gpe with ol , thus giving an evident computational advantages .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be seen as a generalization of the existence of gap - townes solitons in the quintic nls discussed in @xcite to the case of the multidimensional gross - pitaeviskii equation .",
    "we finally remark that the obtained results can also be applicable for photonic lattices with kerr type of optical nonlinearity where the existence of a critical threshold for the lattice solitons has been observed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model equations and discuss the link between multidimensional gpe with a separable trapping potential and the corresponding 1d nls equation with higher order nonlinearity .",
    "we use a self consistent approach to approximate gap - townes solitons of the gpe with products of exact gap - townes soliton of the corresponding 1d nls equation with higher order nonlinearity . in section",
    "iii we discuss the existence of localized solutions in the multidimensional gpe with ol by means by a variational approach and compare 2d and 3d results with those obtained from the va applied to the quintic and septic nls , respectively . in section",
    "iv we perform a numerical investigation of the existence ( delocalizing ) threshold for gap - townes solitons of the 2d and 3d gpe .",
    "finally , in the last section we briefly summarize our main results .",
    "let us consider the following gross - pitaevskii equation in d - dimensions ( @xmath3 ) as a model for a bec in an optical lattice@xcite @xmath4\\psi + \\gamma|\\psi|^{2}\\psi=0 , \\label{gpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the d - dimensional laplacian , @xmath6 denotes a square optical lattice with strength @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the coefficient of nonlinearity , and @xmath9 for @xmath10 , respectively . here",
    "we will be mainly interested in cases @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the existence of localized solutions of the multidimensional gpe with periodic potential and positive and negative nonlinearities ( atomic scattering lengths ) , has been previously investigated both by variational analysis and by direct numerical simulations . in the following we concentrate on a topic which was not discussed in previous works , namely the existence of gap - townes solitons in the multidimensional gpe and its link to the phenomenon of delocalizing transition . due to the instability properties of these solutions",
    "it is difficult to find them without an analytical guide . to this regard",

    "the above equations can be easily extended to the 3d gpe with periodic potential . in this case",
    "( [ quintic ] ) will be replaced by the following 1d nls equation with septic nonlinearity @xmath19 .",
    "it is appropriate to mention that a factorized solution of the form ( [ factorized ] ) with the components solutions of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem ( [ quintic ] ) can not be an exact solution of the 2d or 3d gpe , since , due to the nonlinearity , the problem is obviously not exactly separable . on the other hand , by imposing the coincidence of the solutions along the diagonal axis may be a constraint for a reasonable approximate solutions of the 2d and 3d problems , especially when the nonlinearity is small .",

    "it is appropriate to mention that the exact profile of the 3d gap - townes soliton , which separates these two behaviors is more difficult to obtain with the separability ansatz than for the previous 2d case , since in the 3d case this ansatz appears to be less accurate .",
