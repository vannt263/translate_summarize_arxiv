    "the optical properties of the semiconductor structures have been the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigation during recent years .",
    "technical progress in the semiconductor crystal growth has made it possible to control semiconductor structures in all three spatial dimensions .",
    "experimentally , physicists can fabricate the quantum wells , in which a thin semiconductor film is sandwiched between different materials via heterojunctions so that the motion of carriers is confined in the two dimensional thin - film plane .",
    "this confinement of carriers to two dimensions gives rise to new quantum effect not observed in bulk materials , for example , an electric field - induced energy shift of the resonance which is called the quantum confined stark effect  @xcite . multi - dimensional quantum confined structure , such as quantum wires and quantum dots , are expected to further improve the quantum effect of the optical devices .",
    "experiments have shown that the confinement of carriers in these low dimensional semiconductor structures ( ldss s ) can result in novel optical - electronic effects which may lead to fabrication of new optical components . some new fascinating achievements in the areas , such as semiconductor microcavity ( smc ) quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , quantum dot microlaser and turnstile device  @xcite , quantum computer with quantum dot  @xcite , and semiconductor random laser  @xcite etc .",
    ", encourage the study of optical - electronic properties of these micro - structures .    the present trend toward smaller - scale nanostructures and the continuous development of new and improved materials",
    "have started a steady progress towards fabrication of more ideal optical microcavities .",
    "if an ldss is placed in an smc , the optical mode structure of the smc will change around the ldss . using this effect many interesting phenomena , such as tailoring the spontaneous radiation pattern and rate  @xcite , the coupled exciton - photon mode splitting in a semiconductor quantum microcavity  @xcite ,",
    "have been demonstrated .",
    "therefore the investigation of optical properties of an ldss placed into a semiconductor cavity is very important and necessary for theoretical and experimental physicists .",
    "it is known that the interaction between the light and these micro - systems occurs via exciton  @xcite which is an electron - hole pair bound by the coulomb attraction .",
    "the radiation of exciton exhibits the superradiant character .",
    "the initial theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies were focused on the superradiance of the wannier excitons in semiconductor micro - crystallites .",
    "then , the superradiance of the frenkel excitons was observed in j aggregates at low temperature  @xcite . in 1995 ,",
    "the superradiance of high density frenkel excitons in a r - phycoerythrin(r - pe ) single crystal was observed at room temperature for the first time  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the spontaneous radiation of the frenkel excitons in a crystal slab under the condition of low excitation with an exactly solvable model and shown its superradiance nature  @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed the quantum statistical properties of the output field and the semiconductor qed for the high density excitons in a semiconductor microcavity  @xcite . in the former works ,",
    "our main interest was the resonant interaction between the excitons and the cavity field .",
    "but we know that the detuning between the cavity field and exciton always affects the radiation properties of the exciton in the quantum well  @xcite .",
    "so in this paper we will discuss a general model of the interaction between the high density excitons in a quantum well and a single - mode cavity field .    in section",
    "ii , we give a general theoretical model of the non - resonant interaction between a single - mode cavity field and the exctions . by virtue of the schwinger s representation of the angular momentum using two boson modes ,",
    "we approximately obtain the analytical solution of the system . in section iii , the stationary physical spectrum of the excitons , which are initially in the number state or the superposed state of two different number states is presented .",
    "a comparison of these results with those of the resonant cases will be also given .",
    "finally , a brief summary and conclusion are presented in section iv .",
    "in this section , we present a theoretical model to study the interaction between a quantum well and a single - mode cavity field . we assume that the cavity and the quantum well are ideal , and they are in an extremely low temperature circumstance .",
    "the quantum well interacts with cavity field via exciton , which is an electron - hole pair bound by the coulomb attraction . at extremely low temperatures ,",
    "the thermal momentum of the excitons is so small that the thermalized excitons can be neglected .",
    "then there are only excitons with zero in - plane momentum .",
    "it is well known that when the density of the excitons becomes high , the ideal bosonic model of the excitons is no longer",
    "adequate ( in the case of a gaas quantum well , the ideal bosonic model becomes inadequate when the density of the excitons exceeds @xmath0",
    "@xmath1  @xcite ) for a theoretical study .",
    "however , we can describe exciton operators as hypothetical bosonic operators . in order to deal with the deviation of the exciton operators from the ideal bosonic operators , we introduce an effective non - linear interaction between these hypothetical ideal bosons to correct the high excitons density effect  @xcite .",
    "these considerations lead to the following hamiltonian after the rotating - wave approximation is made  @xcite : @xmath2 with    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are creation ( annihilation ) operators of the excitons with frequency @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of the cavity field with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that both of them obey the bosonic commutation relation @xmath8=[a , a^{\\dagger}]=1 $ ] .",
    "@xmath9 stands for the interaction strength between the cavity field and the excitons .",
    "@xmath10 represents an effective interaction constant between the excitons .",
    "@xmath10 is assumed as a positive real number , which means that the bi - excitons are not stable in this system of the quantum well .",
    "so , it is reasonable to consider that only excitons are present in the quantum well .",
    "@xmath11 is a positive real number which describes the phase space filling factor .",
    "the ratio of the phase space filling factor to the interaction constant of the excitons is about @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of the same order , or @xmath13 . in that case , it is convenient to give the solution of eq.([eq : h0 ] ) using the schwinger s representation of the angular momentum for two - mode bosonic operators  @xcite .",
    "angular momentum operators can be constructed as    @xmath14    and total number operator as @xmath15    using the ladder operators @xmath16 of the cavity field and the exciton operators @xmath17 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath18 is the constant of motion with respect to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "then the total angular momentum operator can be expressed as @xmath19 for any fixed total particle number @xmath20 , the common eigen - states of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the fock states with @xmath25 photons in the cavity and @xmath26 excitons in the quantum well , respectively .",
    "although @xmath27 must be integers , @xmath28 and @xmath29 can both be integers or both be half - odd integers .",
    "if we define @xmath30 then eq.([eq : h0 ] ) can be simplified into @xmath31 in terms of an @xmath32 rotation @xmath33 of @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of hamiltonian ( [ eq : sh ] ) are , respectively , @xmath37 it is clear that eigenfunction @xmath38 represents a dressed exciton state or a polariton state .",
    "based on eq.([eq : pp ] ) , using perturbation theory and keeping @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters up to their first - order , we obtain the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) as :    @xmath39    and @xmath40    in order to obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we first calculate the matrix elements of the perturbation term as follows    @xmath43 ( j - m-1)(j - m)\\delta_{n , m}+\\hbar[a(\\sin\\theta)^{2}-\\nu \\sin 2\\theta ] ( j^{2}-m^{2})\\delta_{n , m } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a(\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{2}\\sin \\theta -\\nu \\cos\\theta ( \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2+\\frac{\\nu}{2}(\\sin\\theta)^2 ] ( j - m)\\sqrt{(j+m)(j - m+1)}\\delta_{n , m-1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hbar[\\frac{a}{4}(\\sin\\theta)^{2 } -\\frac{\\nu}{4}\\sin 2\\theta ] \\sqrt{(j+m)(j+m-1)}\\sqrt{(j - m+1)(j - m+2)}\\delta_{n , m-2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a\\sin\\theta ( \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{2}-\\nu \\cos\\theta ( \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2+\\frac{\\nu}{2 } ( \\sin \\theta)^2 ] \\sqrt{(j - m)(j+m+1)}(j - m-1)\\delta_{n , m+1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a\\sin\\theta(\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{2}-\\nu \\cos\\theta ( \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2-\\frac{\\nu}{2}(\\sin\\theta)^2 ] \\sqrt{(j+m)(j - m+1)}(j+m-1)\\delta_{n , m-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a\\sin\\theta(\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{2}-\\nu \\cos\\theta ( \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2-\\frac{\\nu}{2}(\\sin\\theta)^2 ] \\sqrt{(j - m)(j+m+1)}(j+m)\\delta_{n , m+1}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[\\frac{a}{4}(\\sin\\theta)^{2}-\\frac{\\nu}{4}\\sin 2\\theta ] \\sqrt{(j+m+1)(j+m+2)}\\sqrt{(j - m)(j - m-1)}\\delta_{n , m+2}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a(\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{4}-\\nu \\sin\\theta(\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2](j+m)(j+m-1)\\delta_{n , m } , \\label{eq : pp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    2and then write the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h])as : @xmath44 ( j^{2}-m^{2 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a(\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{4}+\\nu \\sin\\theta ( \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2 ] ( j - m-1)(j - m ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar[a(\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^{4}-\\nu \\sin\\theta(\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2](j+m)(j+m-1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) can be easily obtained using eq.([eq : ee ] ) and eqs.([eq : pp],[eq : pp1 ] ) . then the time",
    "evolution operators of the system can be written as @xmath45 consequently , for any initial state @xmath46 , the time - dependent wave function can be obtained as @xmath47 .",
    "under the condition of ideal cavity , ideal quantum well , and extremely low temperature , both the excitons and the cavity field have zero linewidth .",
    "assumption of ideal quantum well is important to eliminate the linewidth of excitons which may be caused by the fluctuations of the quantum well .",
    "so the only broadening mechanism comes from the detecting spectrometer for which the physical spectrum can be defined as  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the half - bandwidth of the spectrometer , and @xmath50 is the time length of the excitation in the cavity .",
    "@xmath51 represents the dipole correlation function of the excitons and is defined as @xmath52 with the initial state @xmath46 of the system , and @xmath53 @xmath54 where the second term comes from the correction of the phase space filling effect  @xcite . taking into account the fact that @xmath55",
    ", we can obtain the correlation @xmath51 as @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath28 is determined only by the initial state @xmath46 .",
    "then the stationary physical spectrum can be written as @xmath59 , both @xmath60 and @xmath61 must be satistied .",
    "according to the above selection rule , eq.([eq : s ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath62 the eigenvalues determine the position of the spectral component and @xmath63 determine the intensity of the spectral lines .",
    "the above spectral formula is similar to that of reference  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will consider that the system is initially prepared in the bare exciton state using the resonant femtosecond pulse pumping method  @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath64 , so that all frequency quantities have a unit of energy .",
    "moreover , we impose that initially there are no photons in the cavity .",
    "then for a system , which is initially prepared in the single exciton state , the physical spectrum from @xmath65 to @xmath66 can be simplified into @xmath67 which has double peaks located at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear that the phase space filling factor and the interaction between the excitons , which are the results of the multi - exciton presence , do nt affect the physical spectrum of this system .",
    "= 7.0 cm    figure @xmath70 depicts the effect of detuning @xmath71 on the relative heights and the positions of the two peaks in the spectrum of the system described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "the difference between the heights of the two peaks in the physical spectrum is zero when @xmath72 ( resonance case ) .",
    "this profile line is observed for two - level atomic systems , too . in the non - resonant case ,",
    "peaks have different heights and the frequency difference between them become larger due to detuning effect . with the increase of @xmath71 ,",
    "the height of the peak locating at @xmath68 reduces gradually , whereas the height of the peak at @xmath69 increases . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) and the condition @xmath73 , it can be derived that if @xmath71 and the coupling constant @xmath9 satisfy the condition @xmath74 , then @xmath75 , which means the physical spectrum has approximately one peak .",
    "it is seen in fig . @xmath70 that when @xmath76 , the difference between the heights of the peaks becomes constant .",
    "a further analysis will reveal that at those values of @xmath71 , the height of the peak located at @xmath68 becomes very close to zero , therefore the spectrum can be interpreted as having a single peak .    with the increase of the pumping power",
    ", the emission spectrum of the system becomes complex .",
    "the simplest non - trivial example , for which the non - linear terms play a role in the physical spectrum , is obtained when the quantum well has initially two excitons and there is no photon in the cavity . in that case , the physical spectrum from @xmath77 to @xmath65 becomes @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "we know that there are three and two dressed exciton states for @xmath77 and @xmath65 , respectively . according to the selection rule",
    ", there should be six peaks in the physical spectrum ( [ eq : pppp ] ) .",
    "figure @xmath80 , which is drawn using eq.([eq : pppp ] ) , depicts the radiation spectrum @xmath81 of the excitons as a function of the frequency difference @xmath82 under the resonant condition with or without considering the phase space filling factor . in order to give a clear picture ,",
    "the natural logarithm of the physical spectrum is plotted in fig.@xmath80 ( in figs.@xmath83 and @xmath84 , as well ) .",
    "it is understood that the phase filling factor does not affect the line profile of the spectrum , but changes the heights and the positions of the peaks .",
    "so in the following numerical results , we have neglected the phase space filling effect .",
    "figure 3 clarifies that the detuning between the cavity field and the excitons changes not only the positions of the peaks , but also reduces their heights .",
    "the larger the detuning is , the stronger its effect on the physical spectrum is . as it is seen in fig.@xmath83 , @xmath85 mev only slightly changes the position and heights of the peaks keeping their number constant .",
    "however , with increasing detuning up to @xmath86 mev , the number of the peaks in the spectrum gradually decreases because ( i ) the heights of some peaks become so small when compared to main peak that they can be neglected , and ( ii ) some peaks are shifted so close to each other that they can not be resolved .",
    "= 8 cm    = 8 cm    the variation of the positions of the six peaks ( labeled as @xmath87 , @xmath88 in the spectrum of fig.@xmath89 ) of eq.([eq : pppp ] ) is plotted as a function of detuning @xmath71 in figure @xmath90 .",
    "it is seen that with the increase in detuning , the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 becomes almost zero so that they can not be resolved .",
    "peaks @xmath87 and @xmath93 , respectively , shifts to more positive and negative sides of the spectrum .",
    "the positions of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are interchanged with increasing @xmath71 , and after this interchange their relative positions are kept the same .",
    "= 8 cm    it is also observed that when the half - bandwidth of the spectrometer @xmath49 and the coupling constant between the cavity field and the excitons are of the same order , the number of the peaks in the physical spectrum ( [ eq : pppp ] ) becomes two .",
    "this is because the spectrometer can not resolve the position of some of the peaks .",
    "figure @xmath96 shows that under the conditions of the weak interaction between the excitons , the heights of the peaks in spectrum are equal if the cavity field resonates with the excitons .",
    "however for the non - resonant case , the heights of the two peaks are not equal due to the detuning between the frequencies of the cavity field and that of the excitons even if there is weak interaction between the excitons .",
    "superposition of two different exciton states is yet another interesting case to investigate .",
    "if we consider the excitons are initially in the state @xmath97 and the cavity field is in the vacuum state @xmath98 , then the physical spectrum can be written as @xmath99 from which it can be found that there are eight peaks in the emission spectrum of the excitons .",
    "figure @xmath84 depicts the line profile of the physical spectrum @xmath81 as a function of the frequency difference @xmath82 under the resonant condition .",
    "= 6.5 cm    it is seen from fig.@xmath84 that the physical spectrum is a simple sum of one and two exciton spectra . at first sight",
    ", it seems that it is a normal and expected result .",
    "however , if the half - bandwidth of the spectrometer gradually increases , the peaks of the physical spectrum given by eq.([eq : two ] ) reduces from eight to one .",
    "in this study , the interaction between the high - density excitons in a quantum well and the cavity field is investigated under both the resonant and non - resonant conditions .",
    "the model and the discussions presented in this paper are valid only when the excitons and cavity field have zero linewidth .    an analytical expression of the physical spectrum of the excitons is obtained .",
    "a discussion of the physical spectrum of the excitons which are initially prepared in the number state or the superposed state of the two different number states is presented .",
    "it is observed that for a system having a single exciton state initially , the resonant interaction between the cavity field and the excitons gives the results similar to those of the two - level atomic system for which the two peaks in the physical spectrum have equal heights .",
    "however , non - resonant interaction results in the detuning which will change both the amplitudes of peaks and the frequency difference between them .",
    "it is understood that the phase space filling effect does not affect the line profile of the physical spectrum , but it adjusts the heights and positions of the physical spectrum .",
    "it is also shown that the number of the peaks in the physical spectrum is reduced with increase in either the detuning quantity or the half - bandwidth of the spectrometer . under the conditions of the low exciton density and the resonant interaction between the cavity field and the excitons , if the half - bandwidth of the spectrometer has the same order as the coupling constant between the cavity field and excitons , then spectrum has two peaks with equal heights .",
    "but in the case of higher exciton density or the non - resonant interaction , even if the the half - bandwidth of the spectrometer has the same order as the coupling constant between the cavity field and excitons , the two peaks have different heights due to the interaction between the excitons or the detuning effect . when the system is initially in the superposed state of a single exciton state and two exctions state , the resultant physical spectrum is a simple sum of the spectra of the components of the superposition states .",
