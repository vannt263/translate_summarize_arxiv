    "with the rapidly increasing amount and statistical significance of the data collected by underground neutrino detectors @xcite , the precise calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux is highly desirable , since the interpretation of the data relies on the calculated flux as a fundamental input . in the contained events analysis , the ratio of ratios , namely the ratio of the observed number of muon events to the number of observed electron events with the corresponding ratio of the same numbers from simulation calculations , is not sensitive to the absolute neutrino flux .",
    "however , in the analysis of upward going muon events , the absolute flux need to be known accurately in addition to the detailed features of the flux such as the zenithal and azimuthal angle distribution @xcite . the availability of calculations of proven validity would discard all possible doubt on the conclusions .    in the past 20 years",
    ", various methods including analytical , semianalytical @xcite , kinematical @xcite and monte carlo techniques @xcite , have been applied to calculate the atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "however , the accuracy of the results was limited by the accuracy on both the cosmic ray ( cr ) abundance , and the production cross section of the parent particle ( @xmath0 ) in the collisions of crs with atmospheric nuclei over the relevant energy range @xcite , used in these calculations .",
    "these two quantities being basic inputs to the calculations .",
    "the analysis and the comparisons made in @xcite indicated that the particular choice of the primary spectra and the strong interaction model , as well as the earth geomagnetic field could result in significant differences in the calculated neutrino flux .",
    "the new ams @xcite and bess @xcite measurements of the cr proton flux consistently agree to within @xmath1 .",
    "the values reported are lower than those used in the previous works by about 20 to 25 % @xcite .",
    "besides , some analysis @xcite showed that the pion production cross sections given by the general purpose softwares based on theoretical models , may largely depart from experimental data .",
    "although the values of the flavor ratio reported in previous works are very close to each other , the absolute values of the flux obtained in these works fail to be consistent with each other within satisfying precision @xcite .",
    "in particular , these results seem not to predict quantitatively the observed east - west ( ew ) asymmetry of the neutrino induced events @xcite which is expected to originate from the ew asymmetry of the geomagnetic cut off ( gc ) on the incoming cr - mainly protons and helium particles here - momentum , due to the earth magnetic field .",
    "any calculation , to be reliable , must reproduce the experimental ew asymmetry since flavor oscillations do not change the direction of motion .",
    "this requirement can be taken as a testing ground for the various approaches of the neutrino flux calculations .    with the occurrence of the new measurements of the primary cr flux , together with the continuous improvement of the cross section calculations ,",
    "most approaches have been updated @xcite , and new calculations have been proposed @xcite . in parallel",
    ", experimental groups also made greater efforts aiming to understand the neutrino production process in the atmosphere @xcite with the measurements on the muon flux at various altitudes , together with those of the primary proton and helium flux .",
    "these new data provided a sounder testing ground for the reliability of the numerical approaches to the particle production and to the particle dynamics and kinematics in the atmosphere and in the earth geomagnetic field .",
    "the work reported here is an extension of a research program which primary motivations were to interpret the ams01 measurements of the charged particle flux in near earth orbit @xcite . to this purpose , an event generator describing the cr induced cascade in the atmosphere",
    ", particle propagation in geomagnetic field , and interactions with the medium , has been developed and successfully used to reproduce the proton @xcite , electron - positron @xcite and helium 3 @xcite flux data measured by ams and their relevant dependence on the geomagnetic coordinates .",
    "since the @xmath2 generator of the program was basically the same as needed to generate the muon and neutrino flux , the code could be rather straightforwardly extended to describe the latter and to address the important issue of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present approach allows an evaluation of the neutrino flux induced by both the primary cr flux and the atmospheric secondary flux , which have been tested sensitively and independently on other observables , conferring to the results a character of sound reliability .",
    "the above issues will be discussed in details below .",
    "this approach is also being successfully applied to the calculation of the atmospheric secondary flux of antinucleons @xcite .",
    "the article reports on the calculation of the atmospheric muon and neutrino flux .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ meth ] , the method and models used in the calculations are introduced .",
    "section [ mus ] is devoted to the results on the muon flux . in section [ glob ] ,",
    "the properties of the calculated neutrino flux averaged on the whole terrestrial sphere are discussed , while the properties of the local neutrino flux calculated at the location of the super - kamiokande detector are discussed in section [ sk ] . in the following section [ soud ] the neutrino flux at the soudan detector location",
    "is discussed along the same lines .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section [ conc ] .",
    "the method of calculation and the models used in the simulation program are described in @xcite .",
    "the calculation proceeds by means of a full 3d - simulation program .",
    "the main features of this approach are listed below for the reader s convenience , with emphasis on some particular points relevant to the neutrino and muon flux .    1 .",
    "cr generation : incident cosmic rays are generated on a virtual sphere chosen at some distance from the earth as discussed below .",
    "events are generated randomly and uniformly on this sphere . in order to get an isotropic flux at any point inside the volume of the virtual sphere",
    ", the differential element of the zenith angle distribution of the particle direction generated on the sphere must be proportional to @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the zenithal angle of the particle @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the particle ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and its momentum are then generated according to the cr abundances and spectra discussed below . generating random events on a virtual sphere far enough from the earth , i.e. , at a distance where the geomagnetic field effects are negligible , so that the cr flux is isotropic , would imply a very large distance from earth and thus the generation of a tremendous number of events , most of them being useless for the simulation purpose since they would not reach the earth - atmosphere system . instead of this time consuming direct method ,",
    "the generation sphere is chosen close to earth , at a 2000  km altitude .",
    "the geomagnetic cut - off is then applied by back - tracing the particle trajectory in the geomagnetic field . in this procedure ,",
    "only those particles reaching a backtracing distance of 10 earth radii are kept in the sample .",
    "flux conservation along any allowed particle path in the geomagnetic field is ensured by liouville s theorem application @xcite .",
    "2 .    cr abundances : for the incident cr proton and helium flux , functional forms fitted to the 1998 ams measurements were used @xcite . for other periods of the solar cycle",
    "than those of the measurements , the incident cosmic flux are corrected for the different solar modulation effects using a simple force law approximation @xcite .",
    "+ ._mean flux @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 multiplicity @xmath10 , of the components of the cr flux , and their product normalized to 1 , for the conditions described in the text .",
    "[ abund ] _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ew asymmetry for the lepton events is predicted as @xmath11 while for the neutrino flux the following values are obtained : @xmath12 with the same selection criteria as used for superk in the previous section .",
    "it would therefore be of great interest to have some experimental values for this experiment , to provide a further test the present approach , and a step forward to a better global understanding of the problem .",
    "in summary , the atmospheric neutrino flux has been simulated by means of an event generator dedicated to the general cosmic ray - atmosphere interactions , developed to account for the ams01 results , originally .",
    "the successful calculations reported previously on the hadron and lepton flux close to earth , strongly support the method and the models used .    in this work ,",
    "the caprice and heat muon flux data measured at various altitudes in the atmosphere , from about sea level to 38 km have been successfully reproduced , providing further grounds to the correctness of the approach .",
    "a significantly lower absolute value of the flux than found in 1-dimensional calculations @xcite in the low energy range has been reported here . also , the @xmath13 ratio is largely different from all the previous calculations .",
    "in addition , the present results are in agreement with similar results reported in @xcite",
    ".    detailed features of the neutrino flux : zenithal and azimuthal angle distribution and flavor ratios at different latitudes , corresponding energy distributions , production altitude and production angle distributions , have been calculated and discussed .",
    "the components originating from cosmic rays and from the atmospheric cascade have been distinguished and discussed separately .",
    "all the observed features of the calculated flux could be traced back to the primary spectra , @xmath14(@xmath15 ) ratio , muon kinetics , geomagnetic effect , and geometry .",
    "the calculations fail to reproduce quantitatively the east - west asymmetry of the atmospheric neutrino - induced events in the super - k detector .",
    "more investigations are needed to understand this disagreement .",
    "the authors are grateful to n. mokhov , and v. naumov for helpful discussion during the course of this work , and to m. boezio , m. circella , and t. sanuki for making their data available and for providing experimental details .",
