    "it is installed in the upstream end of the magnet and optimized for measurement of the inclusive @xmath6 production by @xmath7 on oxygen .",
    "the pod consists of 76 tracking planes composed of triangular polystyrene scintillating bars ( about @xmath8 ) alternating with thin ( 0.6 mm ) lead foils .",
    "each bar has a 3 cm base , 1.5 cm height and a central hole for a wls fiber .",
    "three tpc s will measure the 3momenta of muons produced by charged current interactions in the detector and will provide the most accurate measurements of the neutrino energy spectrum .",

    "the discharge current for each pixel produces a voltage drop at individual resistors . as a result , the electric field density becomes small and can no longer support the discharge quenched in such a way .",
