    "inspired by wheeler s quest for the existence of geons @xcite , boson stars were introduced by feinblum and mckinley @xcite , kaup @xcite , and bonazzola and ruffini @xcite . in these",
    "boson stars the electromagnetic vector field was replaced by some tentative scalar field . with the discovery of a higgs - like boson last year at the lhc @xcite",
    "the first fundamental scalar field has been found . but numerous scalar fields have been predicted to exist in high energy physics and cosmology .",
    "boson stars arise as stationary localized solutions of the coupled einstein - klein - gordon equations @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of boson stars depend strongly on the type of scalar field potential employed ( see e.g.  the review articles @xcite ) .",
    "mini boson stars arise , when only a mass term is present but no self - interaction .",
    "they can reach only relatively small masses .",
    "larger boson stars are obtained , when a repulsive quartic self - interaction is included @xcite .",
    "for these two types of boson stars gravity is a necessary ingredient .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of a sextic potential one obtains solitonic boson stars @xcite , which possess a flat space - time limit , where they correspond to non - topological solitons @xcite ( or @xmath0-balls @xcite ) . moreover , these solitonic boson stars can reach even higher masses @xcite .",
    "here we consider boson stars , which are compact in the sense , that the scalar field of these spherically symmetric configurations is finite inside a ball of radius @xmath3 , but vanishes identically outside this radius . in this respect",
    "the compact @xmath0-balls resemble stars @xcite .",
    "obtained from a v - shaped self - interaction potential , these compact boson stars also possess a flat space - time limit , compact @xmath0-balls @xcite .",
    "these represent solutions of the signum - gordon equation .",
    "the study of scalar fields with a v - shaped self - interaction potential has revealed interesting physical phenomena . when coupled to electromagnetism",
    ", the balance of forces allows for shell - like configurations @xcite . in these @xmath0-shells",
    "the scalar field vanishes identically both inside a certain radius @xmath4 and outside a certain radius @xmath3 . the scalar field",
    "thus forms a shell of charged matter , @xmath5 .",
    "when coupling these shells to gravity the resulting boson shells possess an empty minkowski space interior @xmath6 .",
    "however , the shells need not be empty in their interior , they can harbour a black hole in there @xcite .",
    "thus one finds that uniqueness and no - hair theorems for black holes can be avoided in the presence of boson shells @xcite .    whereas these previous studies considered only asymptotically flat solutions , we here include a cosmological constant . on the one hand , a positive cosmological constant is relevant from an observational point of view , since it can model the dark energy of the universe .",
    "since boson stars are very compact objects that can possess very high densities , they have been suggested as alternatives to supermassive black holes , e.g.  in the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "even if that would be excluded by observations ( for a discussion see e.g.  @xcite ) boson stars could still act as toy models for very compact objects , e.g.  neutron stars .",
    "such a model of a compact star in a space - time with positive cosmological constant should be a more realistic description of compact stars in the universe , since all observations seem to indicate the existence of a form of dark energy .",
    "a negative cosmological constant , on the other hand , leads to solutions that can be interpreted within the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of boson stars in ads space - time received increasing attention @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that within the context of a holographic description of superconductors and superfluids @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) the formation of scalar hair on charged solitons in asymptotically ads has been interpreted as an insulator / superconductor phase transition @xcite .",
    "the limit of setting the electric charge of the scalar field @xmath7 to infinity , which due to the scaling symmetries corresponds to setting newton s constant @xmath8 to zero , is called the `` the probe limit '' in this context .",
    "we adapt this nomenclature here and refer to the case , where the matter field equation is solved in a fixed background , as `` the probe limit '' . in the opposite limit @xmath9 ,",
    "the gauge symmetry becomes global and the resulting solutions are uncharged solitons in ads .",
    "these are essentially uncharged boson stars and have been suggested to be the holographic description of glueball condensates @xcite .",
    "boson stars in asymptotic ads are also of interest from another point of view .",
    "it has been suggested that the dynamical formation of a black hole in ads is the dual description of thermalization in a strongly coupled quantum field theory .",
    "as such the stability of ads space - time was studied with respect to perturbations , and it was conjectured that ads is unstable under arbitrarily small scalar perturbations and that eventually a black hole would form due to the reflection of the perturbations on the ads boundary @xcite . however , in @xcite it was shown that boson stars appear to be nonlinearly stable .",
    "if that were true , thermalization in the dual field theory would not occur .",
    "hence , boson stars in ads play an important rle in the context of the nonlinear ( in)stability of ads space - time , and thus of its dual description .    here",
    "we first consider the set of boson star solutions for various space - time dimensions @xmath10 in the probe limit .",
    "interestingly , the presence of a positive cosmological constant allows for the existence of boson shells without an electromagnetic field .",
    "we note , that all objects constructed here are electrically neutral .    by solving the coupled set of the einstein - signum - gordon equations , we subsequently determine the domain of existence of the compact ( a)ds boson stars and shells in @xmath10 space - time dimensions .",
    "we analyze their physical properties and briefly address the stability of the boson stars from a catastrophe theory point of view @xcite .",
    "we also address astrophysical aspects of boson stars and boson shells in four dimensions for the physical value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the action , the ansatz , the equations of motion together with the scaling property , the boundary conditions and the global charges .",
    "we present the solutions in the probe limit in section 3 .",
    "the boson stars and shells obtained with the back reaction taken into account are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we end with our conclusions and an outlook in section 5 .",
    "we consider the action of a self - interacting complex scalar field @xmath11 coupled to einstein gravity in @xmath1 dimensions @xmath12 \\sqrt{-g } d^dx   , \\label{action}\\ ] ] with curvature scalar @xmath13 , cosmological constant @xmath14 , newton s constant @xmath8 , and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation . the scalar potential @xmath15 is chosen as @xmath16    variation of the action with respect to the metric and the matter fields leads , respectively , to the einstein equations @xmath17 with stress - energy tensor @xmath18 and the matter field equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "invariance of the action under the global phase transformation @xmath21 leads to the conserved current @xmath22 and the associated conserved charge @xmath0 .      to construct spherically symmetric boson star solutions",
    "we employ schwarzschild - like coordinates and adopt the spherically symmetric metric @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the metric on the @xmath25 dimensional unit sphere .",
    "the associated ansatz for the boson field takes the form @xmath26 with the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the conserved scalar charge @xmath0 @xmath28 is then proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "we next introduce dimensionless quantities by @xmath29 thus the coupling strength of gravity is expressed in terms of the coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "this yields the set of equations @xmath31      let us now specify the boundary conditions for the metric and the boson field . for the metric function @xmath32 we adopt @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the outer radius of the boson star .",
    "since it retains this value to infinity , this fixes the time coordinate .",
    "for the metric function @xmath35 we require at the origin the regularity condition for globally regular ball - like boson star solutions @xmath36 and for globally regular shell - like solutions @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inner radius of the shell .    for boson stars we require for the boson field function one condition at the origin and two conditions at the outer radius @xmath34 @xmath39 since this is one condition too many , we introduce another auxiliary differential equation , @xmath40 , by treating @xmath34 as a function .",
    "thus @xmath41 is constant , but the value of the constant is adjusted in the numerical scheme such that the boundary conditions eqs .",
    "( [ bc ] ) are satisfied .",
    "this determines the outer radius of the star .    for boson shells , on the other hand",
    ", we require at the inner radius @xmath42 and at the outer radius @xmath43 the conditions @xmath44 we now also make the ratio of inner and outer radius @xmath45 an auxiliary ( constant ) variable .    for the numerical computation we introduce the scaled coordinate @xmath46 , such that the inner radius is at @xmath47 and outer radius is at @xmath48 .",
    "we refer to the solution in the exterior region @xmath49 as the outer solution of the boson stars and boson shells . in the asymptotically flat case ,",
    "the outer solution is given by the schwarzschild solution .",
    "in the presence of a cosmological constant the schwarzschild - de sitter and schwarzschild - anti - de sitter solutions @xmath50 are exact solutions of the odes in the exterior region .",
    "hence the mass parameter of the solutions is given by @xmath51      analogously , we refer to the solution in the interior region @xmath52 as the inner solution of the boson shells . in the asymptotically flat case",
    ", the regular inner solution corresponds to flat minkowski space , whereas in the presence of a cosmological constant the regular inner solutions correspond to either de sitter or anti - de sitter space .",
    "note however , that in general @xmath53 .",
    "thus a rescaling of the time coordinate , @xmath54 , is required to obtain the de sitter or anti - de sitter line element in the standard form .    in principle",
    ", we could replace these regular inner solutions by the appropriate black hole solutions , analogously to the asymptotically flat case @xcite",
    ". then these inner solutions would correspond to schwarzschild - de sitter or schwarzschild - anti - de sitter solutions .",
    "here we present the families of solutions in the so called probe limit .",
    "thus we obtain the solutions for vanishing coupling to gravity , i.e. , @xmath55 , in the respective background .      for vanishing cosmological constant the @xmath0-ball solutions can be found analytically and expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "the @xmath56 solution was given in @xcite @xmath57 for @xmath10 dimensions this generalizes according to @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the constant @xmath60 and the outer radius @xmath41 are determined by the conditions @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the latter yields @xmath63 .",
    "hence @xmath34 is the smallest non - vanishing zero of @xmath64 . from the first condition it then follows that @xmath65 .",
    "thus we find @xmath66    the properties of the unique solution in @xmath56 dimensions was discussed in @xcite .",
    "when going to higher dimensions , the properties of the respective solutions vary only slowly with @xmath1 , and likewise when going to @xmath67 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , when restricting to a vanishing cosmological constant , @xmath68 .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath0-ball solutions in an ( anti-)de sitter background in @xmath1 dimensions . to obtain these solutions , we have solved the scalar field equation in the respective background numerically , employing a newton - raphson scheme .",
    "when the scaled cosmological constant @xmath69 is varied , the solutions change smoothly from the minkowski background solutions . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we exhibit the dependence of the solutions on @xmath69 . here",
    "we show the value of the scalar field at the origin @xmath70 together with the value of the outer radius @xmath41 of the solutions for @xmath67 , 4 , 5 and 10 dimensions .    as the scaled cosmological constant @xmath69 increases from zero , the value of the scalar field at the origin @xmath70 decreases along with the outer radius @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly , there is a maximal value @xmath71 , which increases with the dimension @xmath1 , for which these solutions exist . at @xmath71 a second branch of solutions",
    "is encountered . moving backwards along this second branch the value of the scalar field at the origin",
    "@xmath70 continues to decrease , until it reaches zero at a critical value @xmath2 .    at @xmath2",
    "the solutions change character and @xmath0-shells arise .",
    "as @xmath69 decreases further , the inner radius @xmath72 increases along with the outer radius @xmath41 . in the limit @xmath73 the size of the shells diverges while the ratio @xmath74 tends to one .",
    "thus there are no @xmath0-shells in a minkowski or anti - de sitter background .    likewise , when the @xmath0-ball solutions are continued to negative values of the cosmological constant , they change smoothly from the minkowski background solutions , as seen in fig .",
    "as the scaled cosmological constant @xmath69 decreases from zero , the value of the scalar field at the origin @xmath70 increases along with the outer radius @xmath41 until a minimal value @xmath75 encountered , beyond which no such solutions exist .",
    "our data indicate , that @xmath76 . for a derivation of this limit in @xmath56 dimensions",
    "see appendix a.",
    "to study the back reaction of the @xmath0-balls and @xmath0-shells on the space - time , we have solved the coupled system of equations for the metric and the scalar field numerically . in the following we first discuss the case of @xmath56 dimensions , and then turn to other dimensions .",
    "let us start by briefly recalling the properties of the single family of asymptotically flat compact boson star solutions found in @xcite . at @xmath55",
    "this family starts from the @xmath0-ball solution in the minkowski background . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with increasing @xmath30 the value of the scalar field at the origin @xmath70 decreases , until it reaches a finite minimum , and then increases strongly , while @xmath30 undergoes damped oscillations . in other physical quantities these damped oscillations with respect to @xmath30 lead to a spiral - like pattern , as seen for the outer radius @xmath41 or the mass parameter @xmath77 .",
    "such a behaviour is typical for boson stars and neutron stars .    here",
    "we have extended this family of compact boson star solutions to negative values of the coupling constant @xmath30 , as seen in fig .",
    "the physical interpretation of the solutions with negative @xmath30 is that they represent compact solutions made from phantom scalar fields .",
    "thus the negative sign of @xmath30 can be absorbed by the negative lagrangian of the phantom field .",
    "ever since the relevance of dark energy for cosmology became apparent , such phantom fields are found ubiquitously in the literature .",
    "moreover , phantom fields also allow for the formation of various types of wormholes .",
    "let us now turn to compact de sitter boson stars by increasing the value of @xmath69 from zero .",
    "we demonstrate the effect of a positive cosmological constant on the compact solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by exhibiting the physical properties of such families of solutions for several values of @xmath69 .",
    "we see that for finite @xmath69 the minimum of @xmath70 reaches zero .",
    "this signals the occurrence of boson shells .",
    "in particular , for a given value of @xmath69 , @xmath70 reaches zero at a critical value @xmath78 . then for @xmath79 boson shells exist .",
    "@xmath78 is exhibited in fig .",
    "for very small positive @xmath69 , the critical value @xmath78 is negative . thus there",
    "exist phantom boson shells in this case , which turn into ordinary boson shells , as @xmath30 increases beyond zero .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath80 indicates , that indeed no shells exist in this limit .    for all values of @xmath69 the compact boson stars exhibit the characteristic spirals . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] these are seen for the value of the outer radius @xmath41 , the value of the metric function at the outer radius @xmath81 and the value of the scaled mass @xmath77 .",
    "interestingly , phantom type boson star solutions exist only for small values of @xmath69 .",
    "since the mass @xmath77 has the same sign as @xmath30 , branches with negative mass exist only for small values of @xmath69 .    whereas there is an upper bound @xmath82 for the compact boson stars",
    ", there is no such bound for the boson shells . however , with increasing @xmath30 their outer radius decreases , and tends to a finite limiting value . at the same time ,",
    "the ratio of the inner and outer radii @xmath74 increases , and tends to one .",
    "thus the shells become smaller and thinner , while their scaled mass @xmath77 grows . on the other hand , as @xmath30 is kept fixed while @xmath69 is decreased , the shells grow in size , while the ratio @xmath74 tends to one . here in the limit",
    "@xmath83 the shell size diverges .      in the above subsection",
    "we have constructed the domain of existence of compact boson stars and boson shells in terms of dimensionless quantities .",
    "we can obtain physical solutions with dimensionful quantities by scaling these dimensionless solutions appropriately .",
    "in the case of vanishing cosmological constant we have considered compact stars @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we have shown , that when the mass of these boson stars is on the order of the solar mass then their radius is on the order of ten(s ) of kilometers , thus they can correspond in mass and size to neutron stars . moreover , spirals are also encountered for neutron stars , when they approach the black hole limit .    concerning their stability , we employ arguments from catastrophe theory @xcite . according to catastrophe theory ,",
    "the stability changes only at turning points .",
    "thus when starting from a stable configuration , the stability should change at the maximum of the mass .",
    "therefore solutions inside the spiral should be unstable . for neutron stars or ordinary boson stars",
    "this has been confirmed by a mode analysis .",
    "since the value of the cosmological constant as obtained from cosmology is very small , @xmath84 m@xmath85 in metric units , its presence hardly affects the properties of boson stars that have masses on the order of the mass of the sun .",
    "thus the results for boson stars correspond to those obtained before @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of a positive cosmological constant , no matter how small , does allow for boson shells . but",
    "those boson shells possess cosmological mass and length scales .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether such thin boson shells can be associated with voids , i.e.  with vast regions of empty space surrounded by a shell of matter . to see the effect of @xmath14 on the compact boson stars",
    "let us now consider very big scales . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show our scaled results for the mass @xmath86 in units of @xmath87 for boson stars and boson shells versus the outer radius @xmath41 in units of gigaparsec . keeping @xmath14 at its physical value ,",
    "we have translated it into a timescale @xmath88 via the relation ( [ scaling ] ) , employing units of gigayears .",
    "shown in addition are the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon of the corresponding schwarzschild - de sitter space - times .",
    "note , that these two horizons coincide for the extremal configuration with the maximum value of the mass .",
    "these schwarzschild - de sitter values form the boundary , within which all extended objects must remain . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the boson stars reside well within these bounds .",
    "note , that since we consider only positive values of the gravitational coupling , i.e. , no phantom fields , the boson star curves associated with the smaller values of the parameter @xmath88 consist of two disconnected parts .",
    "the boson shells , in contrast , exist until they reach this cosmological bound .",
    "in particular , all boson shell curves extend precisely to the extremal value of the schwarzschild - de sitter curve , where the two horizons coincide .",
    "when approaching this limiting configuration , the inner radius of the shells approaches the outer radius .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath74 tends to the value one in this limit .",
    "more massive shells can not exist .    converting the values in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] into numerical values we find that with @xmath89 the mass of the boson stars is on the order of @xmath90 kg and their radius is on the order of gpc .",
    "these are sizes that are beyond those of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "if there were dark matter distributions on such large scales , our solutions would be able to model those .",
    "choosing somewhat smaller values of @xmath88 , on the other hand , we would find sizes relevant for galaxies or galaxy clusters , so that these solutions could be considered to model the dark matter halo of galaxies or the dark matter in galaxy clusters , respectively .",
    "note that in the limit of vanishing mass the radius @xmath91 becomes spurious since the non - scaled boson field vanishes identically .",
    "as expected , compact boson stars exist also for negative values of the cosmological constant .",
    "indeed , the asymptotically minkowski solutions can be smoothly extended to negative values of @xmath69 , thus yielding asymptotically ads boson stars . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we exhibit some of their physical properties versus the coupling constant @xmath30 , for several values of @xmath69 .",
    "we note , that the domain of existence of these compact ads boson stars decreases with decreasing @xmath69 .",
    "this suggests that there is a limiting minimal value for @xmath69 for compact boson stars .",
    "analogously to the ds case , some of the physical properties of ads boson stars exhibit damped oscillations with respect to @xmath30 whereas other properties exhibit spirals .",
    "moreover , as in the ds case , there are phantom boson stars , associated with negative values of @xmath30 .",
    "however , we do not find ads boson shells . in the ads case , the scalar field @xmath92 never reaches the value zero at the origin , necessary for boson shells to arise .",
    "we conclude , that the extra attraction associated with negative @xmath14 inhibits the formation of ads shells even stronger than in the asymptotically flat case , @xmath93 .",
    "the existence of shells needs repulsion , that can be provided either by a positive cosmological constant , as seen in the previous subsection , or by the presence of electric charge @xcite .",
    "here we consider the domain of solutions and their properties for various space - time dimensions .",
    "we have made a complete study for dimensions @xmath67 , 5 and 10 .",
    "since the dependence on @xmath1 is mostly rather smooth , we exhibit only a number of selected cases . as an example of a solution , we show an asymptotically de sitter boson shell solution in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "we start our discussion by considering boson stars and boson shells in @xmath95 dimensions .",
    "some of their properties are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , and can be compared to those of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "a surprising feature is that in @xmath95 boson shells seem to exist in the asymptotically flat case , @xmath96 .",
    "this follows from the additional ( almost vertical ) line present in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for @xmath70 .",
    "however , since this line is reaching zero for a very small negative value of @xmath30 , those shells are phantom shells .",
    "the small branch of phantom shells is seen more clearly in the plot of @xmath97 in the inset . as @xmath83 , the size of these phantom shells diverges .    for finite values of @xmath69 , however , we obtain also ordinary ds boson shells .",
    "the critical value @xmath78 of the transition between the boson stars and shells is seen in fig .",
    "in particular , the resulting phantom ds boson shells continue to exist beyond @xmath55 , where they smoothly turn into ordinary boson shells . as in @xmath56 , at fixed @xmath69 with increasing @xmath30 the outer radius @xmath41 of these boson shells decreases , tending to a finite limiting value , while their ratio @xmath74 of inner and outer radius increases towards one .",
    "the compact ds boson stars , on the other hand , exist only below a maximal value of @xmath30 , which is either given by the onset of the spiral or by the transition to ds boson shells . for a given @xmath69 ,",
    "the domain of existence of ds boson stars in @xmath95 with respect to @xmath30 is smaller than in @xmath56 .",
    "when going to higher dimensions , this trend continues .",
    "in contrast , the domain of existence of phantom ds boson stars increases with increasing @xmath1",
    ".    in @xmath67 dimensions gravity is non - dynamic .",
    "therefore we may expect that boson stars may exhibit a different behavior in @xmath67 dimensions than in higher dimensions .",
    "let us first inspect the dependence of some of the properties of the compact 3-dimensional objects on @xmath30 for several values of @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig8 ] exhibits the scalar field @xmath92 at the origin , @xmath70 , the outer radius @xmath41 , and the scaled mass @xmath77 .",
    "here we observe , that indeed some properties of compact boson stars are very different in @xmath67 dimensions .",
    "first of all , we notice a maximal value of @xmath70 , that decreases with increasing @xmath69 .",
    "this maximal value is encoutered for negative values of @xmath30 , thus these configurations correspond to phantom boson stars .    as this maximal value of @xmath70 two branches of solutions merge .",
    "along one of these branches @xmath70 reaches zero .",
    "thus boson shells emerge at the corresponding critical value @xmath98 .",
    "with increasing @xmath69 the critical value @xmath98 increases ( at least for positive @xmath98 ) , analogously to other dimensions .",
    "the second branch of boson star solutions , however , exhibits a different behaviour from the one observed before",
    ". clearly , the damped oscillations of @xmath70 with @xmath30 are not present",
    ". instead a monotonic decrease of @xmath70 with increasing @xmath30 is observed , and no maximal value of @xmath30 is encountered .",
    "we further observe that for small @xmath69 , @xmath70 and the outer radius @xmath41 depend only weakly on @xmath69 .",
    "the absence of a maximal value of @xmath30 suggests to consider the dependence of the compact boson stars on @xmath69 , choosing fixed large values of @xmath30 . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig8]e and f , for a given @xmath30 boson star solutions exist only up to a maximal value of @xmath69 , that increases with @xmath30 .",
    "finally , we note that the solutions with @xmath68 are not asymptotically flat , since their mass parameter @xmath77 is finite .",
    "this holds for boson stars and boson shells , alike .",
    "let us turn finally to ads boson stars in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "some properties of asymptotically ads boson stars in @xmath95 are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . as in four dimensions , there are no ordinary ads boson shells in other than four dimensions .",

    "the critical curve passes negative values of @xmath69 as well .",
    "like the phantom shells for @xmath99 these phantom ads shells diverge in size as @xmath83 .",
    "otherwise all the basic properties of these ads solutions in @xmath95 are similar to those of the @xmath56 ads solutions discussed above .",
    "moreover , we observe only gradual changes with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the domain of existence of ads boson stars with respect to @xmath30 decreases with @xmath1 .",

    "moreover , the mass becomes practically independent of @xmath30 as @xmath69 becomes sufficiently small .",

    "likewise , @xmath0-balls exist only above a minimal value of the cosmological constant , which seems to correspond to @xmath76 .",
    "subsequently , we have taken the backreaction into account .",
    "the resulting configurations correspond to compact boson stars and boson shells . by solving the coupled set of einstein - scalar field equations , we have obtained the full set of solutions , subject to minkowski , de sitter and anti - de sitter asymptotics for a number of space - time dimensions , ranging from 3 to 10 .    for any dimension @xmath101 there are compact boson stars with all three types of asymptotics .",
    "but concerning their properties , we see a distinct behaviour in three dimensions , that is different from the common behaviour encountered in all higher dimensions . in four and higher dimensions ,",
    "these boson stars exist in a finite intervall @xmath102 . in constrast ,",
    "in three dimensions there is no upper bound on the value of @xmath30 .",
    "also , all boson stars in four and higher dimensions exhibit a spiral - like dependence of the outer radius and the mass on the coupling constant @xmath30 . at the same time , the scalar field value @xmath103 exhibits damped oscillations . in constrast , in three dimensions the respective boson star properties do not exhibit such a spiral - like dependence or damped oscillations .    by exploring the parameter space",
    ", we also find boson stars for negative values of @xmath30 .",
    "these boson stars with negative @xmath30 correspond to phantom boson stars , since the negative sign of @xmath30 can be reinterpreted as a negative sign associated with the scalar field in the lagrangian , and thus with a phantom field .",
    "ample motivation for the consideration of phantom fields is nowadays provided by cosmology . in constrast to boson stars , boson shells do not exist for minkowski asymptotics , if there is no additional force present , balancing the gravitational attraction .",
    "consequently , there are no ordinary ads boson shells .",
    "however , ds boson shells do exist . here",
    "the positive cosmological constant provides the necessary repulsion . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist small regions of phantom ads shells in more than four dimensions .    in four dimensions we have also considered astrophysical aspects of the compact boson stars and boson shells . while we can always adjust the parameters of the solutions to describe compact astrophysical objects with masses and sizes of neutron stars as discussed in @xcite , the influence of the cosmological constant on these objects is negligible , when the physical value of @xmath14 is taken .",
    "the new feature is , however , that in addition to boson stars there exist also boson shells for positive values of @xmath14 .",
    "we have then addressed the question , what the properties of such compact objects would be , if we set the scale by the physical value of @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , in this case the resulting sets of boson stars reach huge masses and sizes , that are more akin to structures on the largest scales of the universe . the boson shells , on the other hand , can grow in mass until they reach the limit , set by the extremal schwarzschild - de sitter solution , for which the event horizon and the cosmological horizon merge .    for negative @xmath14 one might be tempted to consider the ads / cft correspondence and try to interpret the solutions within this framework .",
    "however , all of our solutions are compact .",
    "the outer solutions are all given in terms of the schwarzschild - ads solutions .",
    "thus the ads boundary does not feel anything of the solutions except for their mass .",
    "consequently , for such compact solutions the concept of holography does not work .",
    "indeed , lots of different compact objects may sit in the bulk , and if they have the same mass , the boundary does not notice a difference .    as our next step",
    "we plan to include rotation @xcite .",
    "rotating boson stars are known for non - compact configurations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , their angular momentum @xmath104 is quantized in terms of their particle number @xmath0 , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is an integer .",
    "we expect , that the rotation of compact boson stars will lead to interesting new features .",
    "moreover , there may be rotating boson shells in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "it should also be interesting to construct interacting compact @xmath0-balls and @xmath0-shells for finite cosmological constant .",
    "these should arise in the presence of several complex scalar fields @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank eugen radu for helpful discussions .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support by the dfg , in particular , also within the dfg research training group 1620  models of gravity  .",
    "here we consider the ads solutions in the probe limit . we introduce the scaled coordiante @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , and the scaled scalar field @xmath109 .",
    "this yields for the ode of the function @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "now the general solution of the inhomogeneous ode can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are constants and @xmath122   \\label{inhsol}\\ ] ] is a special solution of the inhomogeneous ode .",
    "let us assume that @xmath116 is regular at @xmath123 and @xmath124 . as a consequence the integral in eq .",

    "now we are left with the problem to determine the range of @xmath141 for which solutions of eq .",
    "( [ bc1b ] ) exist .",
    "although the solutions of the homogeneous ode can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions , we did not succeed to determine the minimal values of @xmath141 in the general case , i.e. in all dimensions .",
    "however , in @xmath56 dimensions the solution @xmath116 can be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions , @xmath142 \\ , \\label{homsol}\\ ] ] which simplifies the problem considerably .",

    "clearly , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ bc1b ] ) can only vanish if the integrand possesses ( at least ) one zero . to analyze this condition",
    "we introduce a new coordinate @xmath146 , with @xmath147 , and consider the function @xmath148 since @xmath149 does not change sign on the interval @xmath147 it is sufficient to consider the function @xmath150 now we are left with the question for which values of @xmath141 the function @xmath151 does not possess a zero .",
    "let us first restrict to @xmath152 .",
    "expanding the function @xmath151 for small values of @xmath153 we find @xmath154 . on the other hand evaluating @xmath151 at @xmath155 yields @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",

    "consequently , we can restrict to @xmath159 .",
    "we rewrite eq .",

    "therefore , @xmath173 and @xmath174 imply @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "this shows that the function @xmath151 does not have a zero for @xmath168 .    to conclude , we have found a lower bound for @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath177 , below which no compact solution can exist .",
    "however , this does not prove that solutions exist for @xmath178 , since the condition eq .",
    "( [ bc1b ] ) is more restrictive than @xmath179 for some @xmath114 . indeed , for @xmath180 eq .",
    "( [ bc1b ] ) yields an equation of the form @xmath181 , which has no solution for @xmath182 .",

    "denote the zero by @xmath184 .",
    "the condition ( [ bc1b ] ) can then be written as @xmath185 the first integral yields a finite negative contribution , since @xmath158 is bounded and negative on @xmath186 .",
    "the second integral on the other hand assumes any positive value between zero and infinity , as @xmath187 ranges between @xmath184 and @xmath188 , since @xmath158 is bounded and positive on @xmath189 .",
