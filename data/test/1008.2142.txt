    "the term rotational doppler effect ( rde ) is used to describe a frequency shift encountered by a receiver of electromagnetic radiation when either the receiver or the source of the radiation are rotating .",
    "the effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "the frequency of the wave , @xmath0 , measured at a given point in space , corresponds to the angular velocity of the rotation of the electric ( magnetic ) field due to the wave .",
    "if the receiver is rotating mechanically at an angular velocity @xmath1 about the axis parallel to the wave vector @xmath2 , than the frequency of the wave perceived by the receiver equals @xmath3 the sign , plus or minus , depends on the helicity of the wave and the direction of the rotation of the receiver .     of the circularly polarized electromagnetic wave @xmath4 is the angular velocity of the rotation of the electric ( magnetic ) field due to the wave at a given point in space .",
    "the rotation of the receiver at an angular velocity @xmath1 , depending on the direction of the rotation and the helicity of the wave , adds or subtracts @xmath1 to the frequency of the wave @xmath5 , rendering @xmath6 in the coordinate frame of the receiver.,width=340 ]    the rde is less commonly known than the conventional doppler effect .",
    "one reason is that it is more difficult to observe .",
    "mssbauer technique provides the most sensitive method for the study of the frequency shift due to the conventional doppler effect , @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the limiting velocity has been a fraction of a millimeter per second and is due to the finite very small linewidth of gamma radiation , @xmath9 .",
    "such a small linewidth has even permitted observation of the transverse doppler effect @xcite by performing mssbauer experiment on a rotating platform . this effect , not to be confused with the rde , consists of the frequency shift @xmath10 due to the relativistic time dilation for a receiver moving tangentially with respect to the source of the radiation .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that the frequency shift as little as @xmath11 due the rde would require angular velocity of the emitter or the receiver in the mssbauer experiment on the order of a few mhz or even a few tens of mhz .",
    "the latter is still one - two orders of magnitude greater than the angular velocities of high - speed rotors used for magic angle spinning in nmr applications .",
    "the rde frequency shift caused by a rotating plate inserted into a beam of circularly polarized light was reported in refs . .",
    "the rde was predicted for rotating light beams @xcite and subsequently observed using millimeter waves @xcite as well as in the optical range @xcite ( see ref . for review ) . in solid state experiments",
    "the rde has proved surprisingly elusive .",
    "frequencies of the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) are typically in the ghz range or higher , which is far above achievable angular velocities of mechanical rotation of macroscopic magnets .",
    "however , small magnetic particles in beams @xcite or in nanopores @xcite may rotate very fast . eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) was recently applied to the analysis of the observed anomalies in the fmr data on rotating nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the rde may be especially important for the nmr technology that uses rapidly spinning samples .",
    "frequency shifts of the quadrupole line in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiment with a rotating sample were reported in ref . and analyzed in terms of berry phase @xcite .",
    "it was never fully explained , however , why such shifts do not persist in the nmr experiments in which the angular velocity of the magic - angle - spinning rotor with the sample often exceeds the linewidth by an order of magnitude .",
    "some hint to answering this question can be found in ref . that studied the effect of the rotation on radiation at the atomic level .",
    "the authors of this work correctly argued that the rde can only be seen in the radiation of atoms and molecules placed in the environment that destroys rotational symmetry .",
    "situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ rde ] rather obviously leads to the frequency shift by @xmath1 when the emitter and the receiver are based upon lc circuits .",
    "this has been tested by the gps for the case of a receiving antenna making as little as @xmath12 revolutions per second as compared to the carrier frequency of the electromagnetic waves in the ghz range @xcite .",
    "eq.([phase ] ) has been also applied to the explanation of the frequency shift encountered by nasa in the communications with pioneer spacecrafts @xcite .",
    "one essential difference between conventional and rotational doppler effects is that the first refers to the inertial systems while the second occurs in the non - inertial systems .",
    "this prompted works that considered rde in the context of nonlocal quantum mechanics in the accelerated frame of reference @xcite .",
    "relativity ( or galilean invariance for @xmath8 ) makes the conventional doppler effect quite universal .",
    "as we shall see below , such a universality should not be expected for the rde .",
    "indeed , the argument behind the rde is based upon perception of a circularly polarized wave by a rotating observer . through the larmor theorem @xcite",
    "the mechanical rotation of the system of charges is equivalent to the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , when making the argument , one has to check whether the resonant frequency of the receiver is affected by the magnetic field .",
    "resonant frequencies of lc circuits are known to be insensitive to the magnetic fields , thus making the argument rather solid . on the contrary",
    ", the frequency of the receiver based upon magnetic resonance would be sensitive to the fictitious magnetic field due to rotation , thus making the argument incomplete .    in this paper",
    "we develop a rigorous theory of the rde for magnetic resonance .",
    "we show that the frequency shift due to rotation is always different from @xmath1 .",
    "broken rotational symmetry is required for the shift to have a non - zero value , in which case the magnetic resonance splits into two lines separated by @xmath13 . for the electron spin resonance ( esr ) violation of the rotational symmetry would naturally arise from the anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor . in a solid state nmr experiment with a rotating sample , violation of symmetry",
    "would be more common in the presence of the magnetic order that provides anisotropy of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "for a ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) the asymmetry comes from the shape of the sample and from magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the physics of spin - rotation coupling is reviewed in section [ sr ] .",
    "frequency shift of the esr in a rotating crystal with anisotropic gyromagnetic tensor is computed in section [ esr ] .",
    "the effect of rotation on the nmr spectra is discussed in section [ nmr ] .",
    "fmr in a rotating sample is studied in section [ fmrsec ] .",
    "power absorption by the rotating magnet is considered in section [ powersec ] .",
    "section [ discussion ] contains some suggestions for experiment and discussion of possible application of the rde in solid state physics .",
    "in classical mechanics the hamiltonian of the system in a rotating coordinate frame is given by @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the hamiltonian at @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the mechanical angular momentum of the system . for a system of charges one can write @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic moment and @xmath20 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "( [ l ] ) then becomes equivalent to the hamiltonian , @xmath21 in the fictitious magnetic field , @xmath22 which is the statement of the larmor theorem @xcite .",
    "neither classical mechanics nor classical field theory deals with the concept of a spin .",
    "the question then arises whether eq.([l ] ) should contain spin @xmath23 alongside with the orbital angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "( [ m ] ) hints that since the magnetic moment can be of spin origin this should be the case .",
    "also it is known from relativistic physics that the generator of rotations is @xmath24 it should be , therefore , naturally expected that in the presence of a spin eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) should be generalized as @xmath25 in quantum theory this relation can be rigorously derived in the following way .",

    "this equation becomes eq .",

    "( [ ls ] ) can be also formally derived as a non - relativistic limit of the dirac equation written in the metric of the rotating coordinate frame @xcite .",
    "the answer for the corresponding schrdinger equation reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the radius - vector and the linear momentum of the electron , respectively , and @xmath37 are pauli matrices .    there has been some confusion in literature regarding the term @xmath38 in the hamiltonian of the body studied in the coordinate frame that rotates together with the body @xcite . to elucidate the physical meaning of this term ,",
    "let us consider the resulting equation of motion for a classical spin - vector @xcite @xmath39 if @xmath15 does not depend on spin , then the spin can not be affected in any way by the rotation of the body . in this case @xmath40 and eq.([ll - eq ] ) simply describes the precession of @xmath23 about @xmath33 : @xmath41 it shows how a constant vector @xmath23 ( or any other vector to this matter ) is viewed by an observer rotating at an angular velocity @xmath33 .",
    "this has nothing to do with the spin - orbit or any other interaction .",
    "such interactions should be accounted for in the @xmath31 part of the hamiltonian @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of rotations on various magnetic resonances is considered in the next sections .",
    "in this section we consider an electron in a rotating crystal or in a rotating quantum dot characterized by the anisotropic gyromagnetic tensor , @xmath43 .",
    "the effect of local rotations due to transverse phonons on the width of the esr has been studied in ref .  .",
    "here we are interested in the effect of the global rotation on the esr frequency . to deal with the stationary states we shall assume that the axis of rotation @xmath44 is parallel to the applied magnetic field @xmath45 and will compute the energy levels of the electron as measured by the observer rotating together with the system",

    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ levels ] ) to the first order in @xmath1 one obtains @xmath59 here @xmath1 can be positive or negative depending on the direction of rotation .",
    "few observations are in order .",
    "firstly , according to eq.([esr - kappa ] ) , the frequency shift for the observer rotating together with the sample containing the electron is never zero . secondly , when the rotation is about one of the principal axes of the gyromagnetic tensor , eq .",
    "( [ esr - kappa ] ) gives @xmath60 , so that the frequency shift for the rotating observer is exactly @xmath1 .",
    "the esr occurs when the frequency @xmath61 of the circularly polarized electromagnetic wave perceived by the rotating observer and given by eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) coincides with @xmath62 .",
    "if the rotation is about one of the principal axes of @xmath43 , then @xmath63 and the angular velocity @xmath1 cancels exactly from the equation @xmath64 for the polarization of the wave that corresponds to @xmath65 , thus , resulting in no rde frequency shift for an experimentalist working in the laboratory frame . for the opposite polarization of the wave , corresponding to @xmath66 , the shift in the rotationally invariant case formally equals @xmath13",
    "however , such photons would have their spin projection in the direction opposite to the one necessary to produce the spin transition .",
    "they can be absorbed only when the rotational symmetry is broken so that the electron spin in the direction of the wave vector is no longer a good quantum number ( see section [ powersec ] ) .",
    "let us consider a nuclear spin @xmath67 in the magnetic field parallel to the axis of rotation of the sample .",
    "it is clear from the previous section that the mechanical rotation combined with the rotationally invariant zeeman interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment with the field , @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 and @xmath70 being nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and gyromagnetic factor , respectively ) are not sufficient to produce the rde .",
    "isotropic hyperfine interaction with an atomic spin @xmath23 of the form @xmath71 would not change this either .",

    "same situation occurs when the direction of the field and the axis of rotation coincide with one of the principal axes of the tensor of hyperfine interactions . for arbitrary rotations eq .",
    "( [ nmr - kappa ] ) gives @xmath94 when @xmath95 , making the frequency shift defined by @xmath96 negligible for the polarization ( @xmath66 ) that is predominantly absorbed due to the selection rule .",
    "is is likely , therefore , that a significant rde in the nmr can be observed only in magnetically ordered materials , in the field comparable or less than the hyperfine field , for rotations about axes that do not coincide with the symmetry axes of the crystal . if these conditions are satisfied , and the width of the resonance is not very large compared to @xmath1 , the nmr produced by linearly polarized waves would split into two lines of uneven intensity separated by @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the existing experimental techniques permit observation of this effect ( see section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the rotating ferromagnets .",
    "we begin with a simplest model of ferromagnetic resonance studied by kittel @xcite . in this model one",

    "the principal axes of @xmath100 coincide with the axes of the ellipsoid .",

    "sizable frequency shift of the fmr observed in the laboratory frame due to the rotation of the sample should occur only at @xmath126 not significantly exceeding @xmath127 and only in a sample lacking the rotational symmetry .",
    "one can easily generalize the above approach to take into account any type of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the formulas look especially simple in the case of the second - order anisotropy .",
    "such anisotropy adds the term @xmath128 to the hamiltonian of the magnet , with @xmath129 being some dimensionless symmetric tensor .",

    "note , however , that the position of the esr or fmr maximum can be determined with an accuracy of a few hundred khz .",
    "it is then not out of question that under appropriate conditions the rde frequency shift and the splitting of the resonance can be observed in high precision esr and fmr experiments even when the rotation frequency is significantly lower than the linewidth . since anisotropy of the sample",
    "is needed to provide rotational asymmetry , the measurements should be performed on single crystals . crystals with significant anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor should be selected for esr experiments . when the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is weak , the rde in fmr can be induced by the asymmetric shape of the sample alone due to the anisotropy of dipole - dipole interactions . even in this case , however , a single crystal would be preferred to provide a narrow linewidth .",

    "the nmr frequency range is much lower than that used in esr and fmr experiments .",
    "the width of the nmr line can be as low as a few khz , that is , well below the available rotational angular velocities .",
    "the key to the observation of rde in a solid state nmr must be the use of a crystal having magnetic order and strong anisotropy of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "a separate interesting question is magnetic resonance in small magnetic particles that are free to rotate .",
    "particles of size in the nanometer range can easily be excited into rotational states with @xmath1 of hundreds of mhz .",
    "contrary to the rotational quantum states of molecules that have been studied for decades , analytical solution of the problem of a quantum - mechanical rotator does not exist even without a spin .",
    "presence of the spin interacting with a mechanical rotation complicates this problem even further .",
    "rigorous solution has been recently found for the low energy states of a rotator that can be treated as a two - state spin system @xcite .",
    "general solution is very difficult to obtain . in the case when a particle consists of a large number of atoms , one can develop a semiclassical approximation in which @xmath33 is replaced with @xmath165 ( with @xmath166 being the moment of inertia ) .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic resonance in nanoparticles that are free to rotate would split into many lines related to the quantization of @xmath17 .",

    "<S> we compute the shift in the frequency of the spin resonance in a solid that rotates in the field of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave . electron spin resonance , nuclear magnetic resonance , and ferromagnetic resonance are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show that contrary to the case of the rotating lc circuit , the shift in the frequency of the spin resonance has strong dependence on the symmetry of the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> the shift due to rotation occurs only when rotational symmetry is broken by the anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor , by the shape of the body , or by magnetocrystalline anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> general expressions for the resonance frequency and power absorption are derived and implications for experiment are discussed . </S>"
