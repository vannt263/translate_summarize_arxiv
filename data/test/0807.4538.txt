    "the tapping algorithm ( ta ) is a hybrid algorithm designed to find the optimal crystalline structure of particle systems constrained to lie on a curved surface and interacting with a long range potential of the form @xmath436 .",
    "hybrid algorithms , such as basin - hopping @xcite and minima - hopping @xcite , have been successfully employed throughout the years to predict the crystalline structure of molecular clusters and proteins . in general",
    "they combine fast local minimizations with global moves whose goal is to release the system from the local minimum it is confined at the end of a local minimization step .",
    "a typical hybrid optimization routine can be summarized in the following two steps : _ 1 _ ) after all the independent variables have been randomly initialized , a local optimization is performed and a local minimum @xmath437 is determined ; _ 2 _ ) from @xmath437 a new configuration @xmath438 is constructed by applying a global ( generally stochastic ) move . the new configuration @xmath438 is then used as starting point for a new local optimization step .",
    "the two steps are iterated until a stopping criterion is satisfied .",
    "the goal is thus to explore the largest possible number of local minima and avoid visiting the same minimum too often .",
    "the crucial point in designing an effective hybrid algorithm is clearly the choice of the global move .",
    "there is no general rule to identify a successful global transformation @xmath439 and physical intuition and prior experience are typically the only guidelines . in the case of basin - hopping , for instance",
    ", the global transformation consists in a monte carlo move in which all the particles of the system are randomly displaced in order to construct a new initial configuration from which a new trial minimum is obtained .",
    "the step is accepted with probability @xmath440 , where @xmath441 is the energy difference between the new and previous minimum and @xmath442 is an inverse temperature adjusted to obtain a @xmath443 acceptance ratio . in the case of minima - hopping the escape step is performed by a short molecular dynamics simulation by assigning the particles a fixed kinetic energy .    the global move adopted in ta is inspired by the process of close packing of spherical objects by tapping and is motivated by the well established role of topological defects in determining the order of two - dimensional non - euclidean crystals as well as the picture of the potential energy surface ( pes ) of such systems as a multi - funnel landscape .",
    "consider a system of say spherical objects confined in a two - dimensional box with an initial disordered configuration . a common way to bias the system toward a close - packed configuration is to provide it kinetic energy by gently tapping the box .",
    "if the system is populated by locally ordered regions ( i.e. grains ) separated by clusters of defects , the primary effect of tapping is to produce a glide of defects inside the crystals with a subsequent rearrangement of grains .",
    "this mechanism can be reproduced numerically in the following way .",
    "the algorithm starts with a random distribution of particles and rapidly quenches the system by performing a fast local minimization .",
    "once particles are trapped in a local minimum , defects are identified by a delaunay triangulation of the lattice .",
    "then the system is tapped by adding to the defect positions a random displacement .",
    "the magnitude of the displacement is given by the typical spacing associated with the particles number times a factor @xmath354 which represents the tapping strength .",
    "this factor is initially set to @xmath444 .",
    "after defects have been moved a new local minimization is performed in order to construct the trial configuration @xmath438 .",
    "the energy of this configuration is compared with the energy of the previous minimum and the move is accepted if their difference is larger than some tolerance factor @xmath445 . if , on the other hand , the energy difference is smaller than @xmath445 , the system has relaxed again to the same minimum . in this case the tapping strength is increased of a factor 10 and the process is repeated until the system successfully hops to a new minimum . the tapping strength @xmath354 is then set to its initial value .",
    "the process is iterated until the rate of discovery of new global minima drops below some threshold value or a maximum number of iterations is reached .    in the current implementation of the algorithm",
    ", the local minimization step is performed using the fletcher - reeves conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite .",
    "analytic expressions for the energy gradient and the hessian matrix are coded in the program in order to reduce the number of evaluations of the objective function during the relaxation step to one single event .",
    "the delaunay triangulation is calculated via the dwyer s divide and conquer algorithm with alternate cuts  @xcite , which runs in @xmath446 time , making the identification of the defects particularly fast .",
    "the main difference between ta and other hybrid algorithms ( including basin - hopping ) is that the escape move consists of adaptive displacements of defects only , rather than of the entire system . in the case of non - euclidean crystals , where the conformation of the energy landscape is subtly related to the arrangement of topological defects ,",
    "this mechanism is believed to explore the pes more accurately . in systems as lennard - jones clusters or spin - glasses , the pes is characterized by an exponential number of local minima separated by energy barriers . for this reason the majority of the algorithms are specifically designed to allow the system to overcome a barrier by providing it a significant amount of energy . if the energy landscape , however , is characterized by the presence of multiple narrow funnels , as believed in this case , the previous methods become ineffective .",
    "a funnel represents the basin of attraction of a given local minimum .",
    "if the global minimum is also located at the bottom of a funnel , an algorithm that is attempting to locate it via a sequence of local minimization steps has a chance to find it exclusively by starting from a configuration already at the muzzle of the funnel .",
    "such possibility , however , is ruled out if all the particles are displaced simultaneously during the escape move and the system is abruptly moved to a completely different place in the energy landscape . on the other hand , by adaptively tapping the defects it is possible to achieve a much finer inspection of the pes and possibly locate the funnel associated with the global minimum .",
