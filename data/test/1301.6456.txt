    "in the field of coding theory , calculations of good upper and lower bounds on the size of a code serves as a benchmark for code design . techniques of constructing subspace codes for error correction in random network coding ( also called ` projective space codes ' ) are similar to the techniques used to construct binary codes .",
    "a projective space code is defined as a subset of subspaces of a vector space .",
    "the viewpoint of lattice theory for projective space codes has already been suggested @xcite .",
    "a lattice is a partially ordered set in which any two elements have a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound .",
    "the set of all subspaces of a vector space is called a projective space and the set of all subsets of a set is called a power set . both the power set and the projective space form lattices under inclusion order .",
    "a ` lattice scheme ' is defined as a subset of a lattice .",
    "it has already been observed in @xcite that binary codes and projective space codes are lattice schemes .",
    "binary codes are power set schemes and projective space codes are projective space schemes .",
    "the lattice framework common to projective space codes and binary codes have also been observed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite establish that the projective space codes are analogs of classical binary codes .",
    "they also investigate the notions of linearity and complements of a code . in @xcite ,",
    "the relationship between binary codes and projective space codes is investigated thoroughly using the framework of lattices and a generalized notion of orthogonal complement is introduced for lattices .",
    "one of the ways to generate a bound on the code size is to capture a bare minimum structure for the bound through an appropriate mathematical abstraction and generalize the approach .",
    "for example , the introduction of ` association schemes ' captured the notion of sphere packing and sphere covering arguments in traditional coding theory @xcite and strengthened the bounds by a linear programming approach . in our paper , the notion of singleton bound is generalized using the framework of lattices .",
    "since error correcting codes for random network coding was proposed in @xcite , there has been a lot of activity in the theory of projective space codes .",
    "the authors of @xcite consider projective space codes in which all the subspaces are of the same dimension .",
    "such codes are called constant dimension codes .",
    "the koetter - kschischang singleton bound ( kks bound ) for constant dimension codes was derived and achieved asymptotically in @xcite .    in the case of binary codes , hamming distance between two binary vectors is a metric on the binary coding space .",
    "similarly the subspace distance , introduced in @xcite , between two subspaces of a vector space is a metric on the projective space . in a projective space ,",
    "the number of elements in a sphere of a particular radius depends on the center of that sphere @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of binary codes , the number of elements in a sphere depends only on the radius of the sphere and not on the center of the sphere .",
    "so the subspace distance on the projective space behaves differently from the hamming distance on the usual binary vectors .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the anticode bound introduced in @xcite gives a setting in which one can get tighter sphere packing bounds for constant dimension codes .",
    "a close look at the bounds for subspace distance and non - existence of nontrivial perfect codes has been given in @xcite .",
    "an appropriate generalization for singleton bounds ( analogous to association scheme for sphere packing / covering bounds ) is not known yet . in this paper , we propose that the lattice framework is appropriate for generalizing singleton bounds .",
    "we derive an upper bound on the size of a lattice scheme , which will be called lattice singleton bound ( lsb ) for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we get the kks bound and the classical singleton bound as special cases of the lsb .",
    "while most results in projective space codes assume that the dimensions of the subspaces in the code are constant , a few papers in literature have considered codes with non - constant dimension . in particular",
    ", the authors of @xcite derive a gilbert - varshamov type bound , which we will term as ` etzion vardy- gilbert varshamov bound ' ( ev - gvb ) , for non - constant dimension codes .",
    "we derive a _",
    "new _ upper bound on the code size for non - constant dimension codes by applying the lsb to the projective lattice . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our singleton bound is the first upper bound for non - constant dimension codes .",
    "the construction of constant dimension codes have been the main focus in the field of code constructions for projective spaces .",
    "the first constant dimension subspace codes introduced in @xcite achieve the kks bound asymptotically .",
    "and there is no known code constructions that exactly achieve the singleton bound proposed in @xcite .",
    "the question of achieving that singleton bound is an open question .",
    "a large class of constant and non - constant dimension codes using ferrer s diagrams and lifted rank metric codes are constructed in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite report marginal improvements over the size of the code compared to the codes of @xcite . a plot of code sizes of the codes reported in @xcite compared to a plot of our upper bound shows that both the reported codes have code sizes that are close to optimal .",
    "this also establishes that our upper bound is tight for atleast certain coding parameters .",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we derive a singleton bound in the framework of lattices .",
    "we recover the singleton bound for binary codes and the singleton bound for constant dimension subspace codes ( kks bound ) as special cases of our lsb .",
    "we obtain a new singleton bound for non - constant dimension subspace codes .",
    "we compare our bound on the code size with the code sizes of non - constant dimension codes found in the literature .",
    "we also compare our upper bound with a gilbert - varshamov type lower bound .",
    "the plots reveal that our bound is tight for certain parameters of the code .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we introduce the preliminaries of lattices in section [ sec_lat_prelims ] .",
    "section [ sec_lat_sch ] introduces the idea of lattice schemes where it is shown that classical codes and subspace codes are both lattice schemes .",
    "section [ sec_main_res ] introduces the singleton bound in the framework of lattice schemes and contains the main theorem of this paper .",
    "section [ sec_main_res ] contains the main distinguishing feature of projective space codes which we believe make singleton type bounds weak in projective spaces . in section [ sec_upp_bou ]",
    ", we obtain a new upper bound for non - constant dimension codes and plot our upper bound with ev - gvb along with different codes constructed in the literature .",
