    " 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "the central aim of this paper is to develop a theory for understanding the large scale geometry on metric spaces and the action of mappings or transformations on metric spaces using convergent sequences at infinity , with reference to the theory of gromov hyperbolic spaces .",
    "in fact , we will focus on mappings between metric spaces which send sequences keeping the condition of the convergence at infinity .",

    "gromov hyperbolic spaces _ were introduced and developed by m. gromov in his very important paper @xcite .",
    "gromov hyperbolic spaces form a large and much studied class of metric spaces , which satisfy certain characteristic properties of hyperbolic geometry . indeed",
    ", they include all complete simply connected riemannian manifolds whose sectional curvature is everywhere less than a negative constant .    convergent sequences at infinity appear naturally in studying the large scale geometry of gromov hyperbolic spaces .",
    "indeed , every gromov hyperbolic space @xmath4 admits a natural ideal boundary @xmath7 , called the _ gromov boundary _ of @xmath4 , and any convergent sequence at infinity in @xmath4 determines a boundary point .",
    "the gromov product admits a canonical extension to the gromov boundary , and the extension defines a distance on the gromov boundary (  1.8b in @xcite .",
    "see also  2 in @xcite ) .    in a gromov hyperbolic space , if two sequences @xmath8 and @xmath9 are convergent together at infinity in the sense that @xmath10 as @xmath6 , they determine the same ideal boundary point . from other viewpoints , this means that we are unable to distinguish between their asymptotic behaviors in a gromov hyperbolic space .",
    "we will call two sequences in an ( arbitrary ) metric space satisfying _ visually indistinguishable_.    one simple but remarkable fact is that in a gromov hyperbolic space , the relation  visually indistinguishable \" defines an equivalence relation on the set of convergent sequences at infinity .",
    "indeed , this fact allows us to define the ideal boundary ( gromov boundary ) for every gromov hyperbolic space .",
    "however , on an arbitrary metric space , the relation is not an equivalent relation .",
    "the _ teichmller distance _ is a natural distance on the teichmller space . in @xcite",
    ", s. kerckhoff discovered an elegant geometric interpretation of the teichmller distance via extremal length .",
    "indeed , kerckhoff s formula asserts that the teichmller distance is represented by the ratio of extremal lengths of simple closed curves on marked riemann surfaces .",
    "following his observation , we often call the geometry on the teichmller distance the _ extremal length geometry on teichmller space_.    in @xcite , h. masur and m. wolf observed that teichmller space is not gromov hyperbolic when the base surface is neither a torus with one hole nor a sphere with four holes .",
    "in fact , the relation  visually indistinguishable \" discussed in the previous section does not define an equivalent relation on the set of convergent sequences at infinity in teichmller space .",
    "in addition , masur @xcite showed that teichmller space is not negatively curved in the sense of busemann , and y. minsky @xcite observed an interesting phenomenon which implies that teichmller space behaves like a positively curved space in the thin part .",
    "thus , it seems to be hard to reap benefit directly from the general theory of negatively curved spaces .    on the other hand , the gromov product on teichmller space connects between the analytic aspect and the topological aspect at infinity of teichmller space described as follows ( see also  [ subsec : cones_intersectionnumber ] ) .",
    "consider two quasiconformal mappings @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the maximal dilatation of @xmath15 .",
    "the equality @xmath16 does not hold in general .",
    "for instance @xmath17 for a quasiconformal mapping with @xmath18 . in the theory of quasiconformal mappings , the following question is fundamental ( but obscure ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ how can we measure the _ insufficiency _ @xmath19 of the composition from @xmath15 and @xmath20 ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for a quasiconformal mapping @xmath21 between riemann surfaces , we denote by @xmath22 the infimum of the maximal dilatations of quasiconformal mappings from @xmath23 to @xmath24 homotopic to @xmath15 .",
    "the teichmller distance between marked riemann surfaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 is originally defined as @xmath27 ( cf . ",
    "[ subsec : teichmuller - space ] ) .",
    "hence , the gromov product of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with base point @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 thus the gromov product measures the  insufficiency \" of the maximal dilatation arising from the difference of markings .    in @xcite , zhong li and yi qi",
    "give another treatment of the insufficiency or the gromov product in the analytic aspect .",
    "the gromov product of the teichmller distance links between the extremal length geometry and the thurston theory on the geometry of simple closed curves with the intersection number .    for two points @xmath28 and @xmath29 in teichmller space ,",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is recognized as the ( weighted ) _ intersection number _ between @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the base point @xmath0 ( cf . ",
    "[ subsec : intersection_number_with_base_point ] ) .",
    "namely , the pairing extends continuously to a canonical boundary in the extremal length geometry on teichmller space , which is called the _ gardiner - masur boundary _ , and the extension coincides with the weighted intersection number function on the boundary where includes the space of projective measured foliations .",
    "in addition , this observation implies that teichmller space has a  boundary continuous \" property in terms of the gromov product ( cf  [ subsec : boundary_continuous ] ) .",
    "as we discussed above , the gromov product of the teichmller distance gives a strong connection between    * analytic aspect : theory on quasiconformal mappings ( insufficiency of the maximal dilation of the composition ) , and * topological aspect : thurston theory ( geometry on simple closed curves with the intersection number ) .",
    "indeed , the above insufficiency coincides with the weight intersection number at infinity of teichmller space .    from the seemingly useful property of the gromov product on teichmller space , one may ask :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what can we know about the large scale geometry of teichmller space using the gromov product ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    however , because of masur - wolf s result discussed above , the properties of the gromov product in terms of the large scale geometry of teichmller space are less known .",
    "thus , from the general point of view , we need to develop a theory on arbitrary metric spaces by specializing the asymptotic behavior on convergent sequences at infinity .",
