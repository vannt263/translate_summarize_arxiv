    "in biology , chemistry and physics it is not uncommon to encounter a situation where the motion of a tagged particle shows deviation from the normal diffusive behavior @xcite . in other words , the long time limit of the mean square displacement @xmath0 of the tagged particle , which could be a biomolecule @xcite , polymer @xcite , nanoparticle @xcite or a colloid bead @xcite , does not scale linearly with time , or more precisely with the time difference @xmath1 , but scales as @xmath2 , where the exponent @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in other words the dynamics is subdiffusive .",
    "this happens due to the nature of the environment around the tagged particle , more often which is viscoelastic , crowded .",
    "another important yet less explored aspect is the nature of the tagged particle displacement distribution , which is not always gaussian as suggested by the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments confirm diffusive yet a non - gaussian dynamics of the tagged particle .",
    "for instance , in a recent single particle tracking experiment , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the diffusion of a colloid bead on phospholipid bilayer tubes to be fickian , whereas the distribution of the displacement of the bead was non - gaussian .",
    "in fact , the distribution for long displacement was observed to be exponential @xcite . in another independent study",
    ", the dynamics of a polystyrene nano - particle in polyethylene peroxide solution has been found to be normal yet non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "deviation from gaussianity can emerge for different reasons , a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) process in a confined state or diffusion in a heterogeneous environment can also result in non - gaussian distribution of the displacement .",
    "it has also been reported that in a complex environment , a tracer can even have two diffusivities , one slower and one faster @xcite .",
    "presence of two diffusivities @xcite or a distribution of diffussivities @xcite can also lead to a process which is non - gaussian .",
    "it was chubnysky and slater @xcite who first came up with the idea of  diffusing diffusivity \" to explain normal yet non - gaussian diffusion .",
    "their model could reproduce the observation of wang _",
    "et al._. in the long time the distribution eventually becomes gaussian following the central limit theorem .",
    "however , an analytically exact model was still lacking until recently .",
    "jain and sebastian @xcite used path integral techniques to show that a random diffusivity model can lead to a normal yet non - gaussian process and in their model , steady state solution of the diffusion equation for the diffusivity resulted an exponential distribution of the diffusivity as predicted in chubnysky and slater @xcite formalism .",
    "all of these theoretical studies actually dealt with the case of static or dynamics disorder in diffusivity @xcite . in a very recent study , cherstvy _ et al . _",
    "have performed computer simulations of langevin equation with random diffusivity to compare with the analytical results @xcite .",
    "their observations also confirmed random diffusivity model as the one which can lead to normal yet non - gaussian distribution .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations on model systems have been quite useful to shed light on tracer diffusion in crowded environment .",
    "recently , ghosh _ et al . _ have studied tracer diffusion in a heterogeneously crowded environment @xcite and subsequently using a continuum lattice made of static obstacles @xcite .",
    "there have been molecular dynamics simulation on tracer diffusion in an environment where the crowders are mobile , such as free polymers @xcite , polymers grafted in cylindrical channel @xcite or in a polymer network @xcite . in addition , kwon _ et al .",
    "_ have also looked into the tracer diffusion in the presence of crowding by taking care of the hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "most of these simulations have focused on homogeneous distributions of crowders , in reality , such as inside a biological cell , the environment is not only crowded but has a heterogeneous distributions of sticky and non - sticky obstacles .",
    "_ in their famous work modelled the bacterial cytoplasm in full atomistic details to perform brownian dynamics simulation for the most abundant proteins in e. coli @xcite , hasnain _ et al .",
    "_ used a coarse - grained model for the same @xcite .",
    "in addition to crowding , a random or periodic external field can also lead to a deviation from normal brownian diffusion .",
    "this can arise when a particle move through a heterogeneous medium with fluctuating interactions or topology @xcite . in this context",
    "it should be mentioned recently a molecular dynamics simulation has been performed with an all particles different ( apd ) system where each particle interact with another with a different potential @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the tracer diffusion in a heterogeneous medium consisting of a collection of polymers with binding zones .",
    "these polymers essentially have specific binding zones acting as traps for the tracer . excluding the binding zones the rest of the polymers serve as the non - sticky obstacles for the tracer with no binding affinity .",
    "thus our model is a combination of sticky and non - sticky obstacles and they are connected along a polymeric chain . on the other hand ,",
    "the crowding is a consequence of the inclusion of many such chains in the simulation box .",
    "therefore we study the effect of crowding and varying interaction on the tracer diffusion simultaneously .",
    "the tracer diffusion is investigated in two different conditions , in one case , the polymers are placed randomly and allowed to move during the simulation , thus mimicking a mobile yet crowded environment . in another case , after randomly placing the polymers in the simulation box they are frozen to ensure a static heterogeneous distribution of sticky and non - sticky obstacles around the tracer .",
    "we find the diffusion process to become non - gaussian when the polymers are frozen as then the tracer experiences a heterogeneous distribution of sticky and non - sticky obstacles and shows jiggling motion in a cage followed by cage to cage jumps . but",
    "the diffusion becomes subdiffusive when the population of the polymers is increased which resulted efficient trapping and becomes even more subdiffusive when the binding affinity of the trapping zones increases .",
    "on the other hand diffusion becomes gaussian when the size of the tracer is increased .",
    "this switching over to gaussian from non - gaussian diffusion on increasing the tracer size is also observed in a recent experiment @xcite on tracer diffusion in polymer gel .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we we present the simulation details , in section iii we discuss the calculation methods .",
    "the results and discussions are given in section iv and we conclude the paper in section v.",

    "we choose three particular values of @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . whereas , the rest of the monomers in the polymers are repulsive to the tracer and this interaction is modelled by weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) potential @xcite .",

    "the interaction between the monomers of the same and different polymers is always repulsive and modelled by wca potential with the same set of parameters mentioned above .",
    "this is just to ensure that these polymers do not form clusters .",
    "we investigate the tracer diffusion in different degrees of crowding . for each value of @xmath14 in lj potential",
    "the simulations are performed in three different monomer volume fractions @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 which is achieved by changing the number of polymers in the system .",
    "however , the system remains in semi - dilute regime even at @xmath28 .",
    "the values of parameters of wca potential remain the same in every simulation . for each set of @xmath14 and @xmath24",
    "we generate thirty trajectories of the tracer . for each simulations",
    "the time step ( @xmath29 ) is chosen to be @xmath30 and after equilibrating the system long enough so that polymers have relaxed , the final simulation are carried out for @xmath31 steps . to accelerate the simulations we record the position of the tracer and each monomers in the system at every @xmath32 step .",
    "therefore we obtain the data for total @xmath33 steps at every @xmath34 time difference .",
    "we use langevin thermostat in nvt ensemble and use velocity verlet algorithm for the integration of each time step .",
    "the dynamics of each particle in the system is described by the langevin equation    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 is the mass of the particles , @xmath37 is the friction coefficient which is considered to be @xmath38 always .",
    "@xmath39 is the position of the particle at time @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the random force acting on it .",
    "the random force @xmath41 is a white noise with zero first moment @xcite .    @xmath42    where , @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath44 is the temperature of the thermostat and the thermal energy , @xmath45 . as shown above all",
    "the particles experience gaussian distributed white noise .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) is over the position of all the particles in the system excluding the one being evaluated .",
    "we do not consider any hydrodynamic interaction in our simulations .",
    "to monitor the tracer diffusion we compute the mean square displacement @xmath0 of the tracer .",

    "the average is done over all the initial values ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we also carry out ensemble average of the time - averaged @xmath50 over all thirty different trajectories for the tracer . for fickian diffusion after the initial ballistic region the @xmath50 is linearly proportional to the time difference i.e. @xmath51 , where , @xmath52 .",
    "whereas , for a subdiffusive process @xmath3 . + to probe the nature of dynamics further , we calculate the velocity autocorrelation function ( @xmath53 )    @xmath54     + for normal brownian motion @xmath53 is exponential whereas negative correlation at short @xmath1 can originate from either fractional brownian motion or continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) in the presence of confinement @xcite . in the long time it approaches zero .",
    "+ now to probe whether the tracer diffusion is gaussian or not , we chose to calculate the non - gaussianity parameter ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the non - gaussianity parameter is used extensively in the literature especially in connection to glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "however we do not have any glass like behavior here as the volume fraction of the polymers are below the onset of glass transition .",
    "for a three dimensional process @xmath55 is given by    @xmath56    one can easily check that the non - gaussianity parameter is exactly zero for a free diffusion with gaussian distribution .",
    "whereas , for non - gaussian process e.g. ctrw will show a deviation from zero @xcite .",
    "ctrw arises when a tracer occasionally stops at intervals and as a result has a long tailed distribution of waiting times @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss and analyze the simulation results . for analysis we relied on our codes . whether the tracer dynamics is diffusive or subdiffusive is interpreted by analyzing the mean square displacement @xmath0 of the tracer .",
    "as already mentioned we consider two different cases of the the tracer dynamics , one where the polymers are initially randomly placed and allowed to move during the simulation and another case where the polymers are frozen after placing them randomly .",
    "thus we have two cases , in one the tracer diffuses in presence of randomly placed but static obstacles and in the other case these obstacles are mobile .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the tracer at varying volume fractions ( @xmath24 ) by changing the number of polymers in the simulation box and also carry out the simulations for a range of binding strengths ( @xmath14 ) between the tracer and the polymer traps .",
    "for simplicity we do not write @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the rest of the paper .",
    "for example , @xmath18 is written as @xmath57 .      in fig.([fig:2]a )",
    "we show the log - log plot of time - ensemble averaged @xmath50 ( ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : msd ] ) ) against the time difference ( @xmath1 ) at different volume fractions ( @xmath24 ) with the binding affinity ( @xmath14 ) of the trapping zones of the polymers fixed at @xmath57 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the @xmath50 of the tracer in the presence of mobile polymers while the dashed lines refer to the same in the presence of frozen polymers .",
    "the @xmath50 of the tracer passes through a ballistic regime at short time . as the volume fractions increases",
    ", the @xmath50 of the tracer grows slowly . in the presence of frozen polymers",
    ", @xmath50 grows even slower in comparison to the same in the presence of mobile polymers .",
    "this happens since , in case of mobile polymers the movement of the polymers facilitate the movement of the tracer as well .",
    "whereas , in case of frozen polymers if the tracer once gets trapped in the binding zones of the polymers , the probability of being trapped for longer time is higher in the absence of any fluctuations coming from the polymers . in fig .",
    "( [ fig:2]b ) the @xmath50 is shown for a range of binding strengths of the trapping zones at a fixed volume fraction , @xmath58 . here",
    "also we compare the effect of mobile as well the frozen polymers on the tracer . due to the higher binding affinity with increasing value of @xmath14 , the tracer tends to bind to the trapping zones for longer time and this results in the lower @xmath50s .",
    "although in the presence of mobile polymers the tracer starts with the ballistic motion and crosses over to brownian motion , in the presence of frozen polymers at very high @xmath14 the @xmath50 practically remains unchanged .",
    "next we calculate the diffusion exponents ( @xmath59 ) from the plot of @xmath50 vs @xmath1 , in the long time limit @xmath2 .",
    "( [ fig:3 ] ) shows diffusion exponents of the tracer at different volume fractions and binding affinities . from fig .",
    "( [ fig:3]a ) it is observed that the tracer undergoes normal brownian motion when the volume fraction is low ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "as the volume occupancy by the polymers increases the tracer becomes subdiffusive and value of @xmath59 drops below @xmath61 . in the presence of mobile polymers at higher volume fraction",
    "the tracer is very weakly subdiffusive whereas in the presence of immobile polymers the tracer exhibits strong subdiffusion . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3]b ) , the tracer shows very strong subdiffusion when the binding affinities of the trapping zones are increased keeping the volume fraction constant .",
    "in fact , in the presence of frozen polymers when the value of @xmath62 , @xmath59 is negligible confirming that the tracer hardly moves and the dynamics becomes non - ergodic .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath50 plot and it implies that the tracer remains trapped for most of the simulation time when the polymers are immobile and binding strength of the trapping zones are high . however , if the simulations are run for a very long time the diffusions should cross over to brownian motion in every case . from the two set of our chosen values of @xmath14 and @xmath24",
    ", we see the effect of higher binding affinity on diffusion precess is more profound in comparison to the volume occupancy by the polymers .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "motivated by recent experiments on the tracer diffusion in polymeric materials @xcite , we investigate the tracer diffusion in a polymer solution by molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the polymers in our model have specific binding zones to trap the tracer and since many in numbers can form cages either transient or permanent depending on whether these polymers are mobile or frozen .",
    "our simulations confirm that it is rather the higher binding strength than the extent of crowding that makes the tracer diffusion subdiffusive . with frozen polymers the tracer exhibits jiggling motion in a cage , followed by cage to cage jumps resembling ctrw and resulting a non - gaussian statistics but whether diffusive or subdiffusive that depends on the volume fraction and the binding strength of the traps .",
    "however , when the polymers are mobile , subdiffusion is observed only when the volume fraction or the binding strengths are high . we also find that with increasing binding strength and the population of the polymers , the probability of the tracer being trapped increases . however , the number of traps hardly facilitate trapping , since in the absence of any attractive interaction between the tracer and the polymers , the tracer rarely gets trapped , whereas in the presence of a small number of polymer traps the tracer shows trapping if the binding affinity of the traps is higher .",
    "therefore it is the binding affinity rather than the number of traps that facilitates trapping .",
    "the system remains in a semi - dilute regime even at the maximum volume fraction we considered .",
    "but in future we would like to explore a more crowded environment relevant in the context of biological cells @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation is that the trapping probability increases with the increasing size of the tracer and the dynamics is still weakly non - gaussian unless the environment is mobile .",
    "we hope that our study will help in understanding tracer diffusion in crowded environment and shed light on how differently mobile and the static crowders control the process .",
