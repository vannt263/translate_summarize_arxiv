    "we present the characteristics and performances of a demonstrative experiment devoted to the observation of ultra high- energy cosmic rays extensive air showers using a radiodetection technique .",
    "the codalema ( cosmic ray detection array with logarithmic electromagnetic antennas ) experiment was set up at the nanay radio observatory in 2003 .",
    "it uses 6 of the 144 log - periodic antennas ( in the 1 - 100  mhz frequency band for codalema ) constituting the decametric array ( dam ) @xcite .    in the first period of observation @xcite , the setup ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) was self - triggered using one devoted antenna : its signal was filtered in an appropriate noise - free frequency band ( 33 - 65  mhz ) chosen after an exhaustive study in the observed local noise frequency spectrum , before entering the adc .",
    "the wide band waveform signals ( 1 - 100 mhz ) of the other antennas were registered when a voltage threshold was reached on the trigger antenna .",
    "the trigger threshold was set at 4  @xmath1 ( @xmath1 : the rms sky background noise ) , leading to an electric field sensitivity of 4  @xmath2v / m .    on figure [ fig : triggerlevel ]",
    "the evolution of the average counting rate at nancay is presented as a function of the trigger level expressed in unit of @xmath1 .",
    "the counting rate evolves greatly with the anthropic activities in the vicinity of the station of nancay and with the weather conditions .    except for the trigger antenna ,",
    "transient signals on the antennas were hidden by radio transmitters signals . consequently ,",
    "a numerical passband filter ( same as trigger frequency band ) was applied , offline , in order to observe coincidences involving several antennas @xcite . using the position and the timing differences between antennas , it was also possible to perform the trajectory reconstruction of the electromagnetic plane wave using a triangulation techniques across the array @xcite .",
    "this level of analysis enables us to bring in light several cosmic ray air shower candidates .",
    "in the second phase operating since mid 2004 , the above setup ( see fig . [",
    "fig : setup2 ] ) has been completed with four double plastic scintillators @xcite placed at the corner of the dam array ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the trigger of the experiment is made of the four particle detectors in coincidence , resulting on an event rate of 0.8 event / mn . all the antennas have now the same role and are passband filtered ( 24 - 82 mhz ) in order to increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the observation of coincident events on antennas and charged particle detectors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r248e1782 ] ) demonstrates the association of antenna transient signals with the occurrence of extensive air showers .",
    "this unambiguous evidence of radio signals through the simultaneous detection of shower particles will allow , for the first time , the characterisation of the shape and amplitude of air showers associated radio pulses . a preliminary event rate of 1/(8 hours )",
    "is observed with antenna multiplicity ranging from 3 to 6 .    from the corresponding deposited energy distribution in scintillators , one can infer the location of the air shower core .",
    "the time delays between the particle detectors allow the reconstruction of the shower axis . from these information",
    ", impact parameter effects can be studied especially those related to non vertical showers .",
    "the latter are expected @xcite to generate amplitude and shape field variations which will better show up in large atmosphere volumes accessible with radiodetection method .",
    "purposely , 5 antennas will be installed ( up to 400 m from the dam ) on a east - west line crossing the existing array .",
    "two effects , namely cerenkov emission and the classical far field , contribute to the radio emission of a shower @xcite .",
    "the line will also allow to study their respective influences and asseses the interest for designing a larger antenna array dedicated to ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
