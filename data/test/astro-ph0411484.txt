    "research into the cosmic rays above @xmath3  ev spectrum shape and into intensity in steep region near @xmath4  ev predicted by greisen  @xcite , zatsepin and kuzmin  @xcite are of great importance for their sources detection .",
    "results obtained in various experiments  @xcite differ from each other by factor 2 and more in absolute intensity , but their shapes are similar .",
    "variations of intensity can not be described with simple power law . at energies greater than the gzk ",
    "cutoff results are inconsistent . at hires",
    "there is only one event with @xmath5  ev and the spectrum is cut  off .",
    "agasa has registered 11 such events ( @xmath6 ) , this could be an evidence for absence of a cutoff .    at the yakutsk array after recent analysis",
    "have been carried out  @xcite there is only one event with energy estimated to be greater than @xmath4  ev . to explain this contradiction with agasa a.  watson assumed that at the yakutsk array such showers are skipped due to inadequate short integration time for large distances from the axis . in this work",
    "we have studied affect of particle arrival time distribution at different distances on estimated density for yakutsk and agasa .",
    "simulation showed that distortion of estimated density at the yakutsk array can not result in such miscalculation .",
    "more substantively is the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) used for axis determination .",
    "we provided axes coordinates determination with adjusted ldf for the largest events , which in average led to increase of @xmath0 .",
    "besides , february 18 2004 a new event with energy @xmath4  ev was detected at the yakutsk array . as a result of these factors",
    "there are three events of @xmath5  ev registered at the yakutsk array .",
    "a shower disk at lagre distance from the axis ( @xmath7  m ) is quite thick . at yakutsk array and at agasa a nearly similar logarithmic rc",
    " converters of the signal from photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) to digital code with @xmath8  mcsec are used . at the yakutsk array for an event to be treated ,",
    "a coincidence of signals from both detectors within 2  mcsec is required .",
    "herewith input of converters is closed in 2  mcsec after coincidence . in the case when shower front is wide , this may result in underestimation of the density .",
    "besides , there is a possibility , that station does nt operate due to large difference in particles arrival times on different detectors and so some showers might be skipped .",
    "these circumstances have been pointed out by watson in his report  @xcite . at agasa input",
    "is permanently open and in the case of wide signal this may lead to density overestimation due to features of converter .    to examine the influence of the effects mentioned above , we have provided simulation of detector s response for distances @xmath9 and 2000  m , based on the particle distribution approximation obtained at agasa  @xcite .",
    "a coefficient @xmath10 was considered  a ratio between density estimated with rc  convector and the one set with program . for the yakutsk array , in the case of detectors with large area , registering large particle densities we got following values : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "same points for agasa : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . at 2000",
    "m distance for yakutsk there is 25% underestimation , for agasa  20% overestimation .    for the real experiment for the shower with @xmath17  ev at @xmath18  m about 2 particles per detector",
    "is expected .",
    "simulation indicated , that in this case underestimation is much less than @xmath19 .",
    "it is connected with the fact that conversion starts only after the first particle hit and at low density the effective thickness of the shower front decreases .",
    "probability of that the station does nt operate due to gap between operating of two separate detectors is more than 2  mcsec is 8.5% and it is lower by factor 3 than those due to poisson fluctuations at this density . but considering this circumstance together with steepness of the ldf at large distances we restricted used effective area beyond the bound of array to obtain the intensity of the largest showers .",
    "simulation showed no significant underestimation of particle density for distances up to 2000  m for density estimating system at the yakutsk array . in the case of agasa ,",
    "when input of rc ",
    "convector is constantly open , besides wide distribution , there is an afterpulse contribution to density overestimation from delayed particles ( probably neutrons ) together with casual additives from background muons .",
    "one can conclude from the data in  @xcite that lagging neutrons can overstate the density by 1.37 already at 500  m and further .",
    "background muons may cause distortions in wide range of axis distances .",
    "if one such particle hits within last 10  mcsec of rc  circuit discharge , then resulting density can be overestimated by factor 2 and more independently of the real density .",
    "the effects mentioned above are excluded thanks to closing of converter s input in 2  mcsec .",
    "events selection was provided as described in  @xcite .",
    "showers with @xmath20 were used . for determination of the intensity for showers with @xmath21  ev ,",
    "an extended area together efficient zone outside the array was used .    at standard procedure of axis determination , the greisen ",
    "linsley approximation of ldf with parameters obtained before at the yakutsk array is used  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite , that for showers with energy greater than @xmath22  ev this ldf badly corresponded with experimental data at @xmath23  m from the axis .",
    "a modified approximation was proposed : @xmath24 for showers with @xmath25  ev parameter @xmath26 does not depend on energy but depends on @xmath27 . in this work we provided axes",
    "coordinates determination with this adjusted ldf . as a result , in average estimated @xmath0 values",
    "increased : 10%  for showers with axes lying within array area and 20% on border .    for energy estimation we used adjusted formulas of @xmath28 and @xmath0  @xcite . for upright showers ( @xmath29 , depth @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the following relationships were obtained using calorimetric method : @xmath31^{0.94 \\pm 0.02}~\\textrm{ev , }     \\label{f2 } \\\\     &    & \\nonumber \\\\ { e_{0 } } & = & ( 4.6 \\pm 1.2 ) \\cdot 10^{17 } \\times \\nonumber \\\\        & \\times & [ s_{600}(0^{\\circ})]^{0.98 \\pm 0.02}~\\textrm{ev . }",

    "the following dependencies of parameters @xmath35 on @xmath28 and @xmath0 have been carried out from experimental data : @xmath39^{-0.185 \\pm 0.02 }                 \\textrm { , } \\label{f5 } \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ \\beta_{600 } & = & ( 0.62 \\pm 0.06 ) \\times \\nonumber \\\\              & & \\times \\left[s_{600}(0^{\\circ})\\right]^{-0.076 \\pm 0.03 }                 \\textrm{. } \\label{f6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        on fig.[fig1 ] the differential energy spectra obtained at the yakutsk array , agasa and hires are presented .",
    "results obtained in different experiments correspond quite well in shape but differ in intensity .",
    "the data from the yakutsk array near @xmath22  ev are higher by factor @xmath40 than hires data and @xmath41% than agasa s .",
    "this rather is connected with the difference in estimation of the showers energy . for estimation of energy in upright showers at agasa",
    "the dependency between @xmath0 and @xmath42 based upon the model calculations  @xcite is used .",
    "our formulas  ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) for upright showers estimate the energy ( 3040)% higher at @xmath43  ev and ( 1520)% higher at @xmath44  ev than it follows from similar models .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in the region of ultra ",
    "high energies the results from yakutsk and agasa approach .",
    "there are 4 events registered in yakutsk with adjusted estimated energy exceeding @xmath45   ev ( see table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "relative errors in energy estimation resulting from uncertainty of the parameters in formulas and errors in determination of axis coordinates and zenith angle in these individual showers amount from 32% to 46% . if the energy is reduced by one standard error then it slightly exceeds the @xmath4  ev threshold only in one event",
    ". therefore the relic cutoff of the spectrum can not be rejected based on yakutsk eas data .",
    "similar experimental errors are observed at agasa . according to  @xcite their averaged value",
    "is about 20% .",
    "taking into account this circumstance a conclusion was made in  @xcite that yet there are too few events recorded to approve the spectrum cutoff absence .",
    "besides , estimations of the energy at agasa depend on model conclusions .",
    "the affects of observed densities mentioned above are also not considered yet .",
    "the hires results are consistent with the gzk  cutoff of the spectrum , the agasa and yakutsk data are inconsistent .",
    "but because of small statistics and errors in energy estimation while it is impossible to final conclude about this problem . to solve this and investigate of affinities of the particles with energies above gzk  cutoff , data with high statistics and good accuracy in the energy estimation a necessary available .",
