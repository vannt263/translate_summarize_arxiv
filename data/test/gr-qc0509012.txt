    "a detailed knowledge about the dynamics of spinning compact binaries is of interest to both astrophysicists and theoretical physicists .",
    "the astrophysical interest arises from the highly accurate radio observations of relativistic binary pulsars , which can be used to test general relativity in strong field regimes @xcite . moreover , inspiralling spinning compact binaries are promising sources of gravitational radiation for the ground based and proposed space based laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interest is due to the possibility of constructing numerically spinning compact binary configurations in full general relativity [ see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ] .",
    "further , it is of some interest to explore if the dynamics of spinning compact binaries will be deterministic or not @xcite .    in many of the above mentioned scenarios ,",
    "the dynamics of spinning compact binaries can be described in great detail by the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity .",
    "the pn approximation allows one to express the equations of motion of a compact binary as corrections to newtonian equations of motion in powers of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the characteristic orbital velocity , the total mass and the typical orbital separation of the binary . for spinning compact binaries , the dynamics is determined , not only by the orbital equations of motion for these objects , but also by the precessional equations for the orbital plane and the spin vectors themselves @xcite .",
    "note that for spinning compact binaries , spin effects enter the dynamics for the first time through spin - orbit interaction .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian describing the leading order spin - orbit interaction can be added to the pn accurate conservative hamiltonian which gives the dynamics of nonspinning compact binaries .",
    "it is highly desirable to obtain keplerian - type parametric solution to the conservative dynamics of spinning compact binaries .",
    "this is so as 1pn accurate quasi - keplerian parametrization , obtained by damour and deruelle @xcite , is heavily employed to analyze radio observations of relativistic binary pulsars and to test general relativity in strong field regimes @xcite .",
    "moreover , 2pn accurate keplerian - type parametric solution for nonspinning compact binaries , obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , is heavily employed to construct highly efficient `` ready to use '' search templates for nonspinning compact binaries moving in inspiralling eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "recently , 3pn accurate generalized quasi - keplerian parametrization for the conservative dynamics of spinning compact binaries in eccentric orbits was obtained in refs .",
    "more precisely , the pn accurate parametric solutions are available for the following two distinct cases : ( i ) the binary is composed of two compact objects of equal mass and two arbitrary spins , and ( ii ) the two objects have unequal masses but only one object has a spin . the pn accurate parametric solution may be used to describe the following two astrophysical situations . as the measured neutron star ( ns )",
    "masses in ns ",
    "ns binaries usually cluster around @xmath5 , case ( i ) may be used to describe such ns ",
    "ns binaries .",
    "the case ( ii ) may be applicable in the instance of a neutron star orbiting a much larger , rapidly rotating black hole . in that case",
    ", the black - hole spin will dominate the orbital precession , and the neutron star spin may be neglected .",
    "the above parametrization , for the two cases considered , shows that the dynamics is integrable and can not be chaotic @xcite .",
    "the parametric solution will be employed to construct `` ready to use '' search templates of spinning compact binaries in inspiralling orbits @xcite .",
    "further , it will also be useful to construct a fully 2pn accurate `` timing formula '' , required to analyze binary pulsar observations by the square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite .    in this paper , we compute , using our parametrization , the observable dimensionless relativistic periastron advance parameter @xmath0 , relevant for binary pulsars .",
    "the expression for @xmath0 that we derive will be applicable , like the parametrization computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , only for the two distinct cases mentioned above .",
    "our expression for @xmath0 is in agreement with the one obtained by damour and schfer @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that damour and schfer employed the evolution equation for the laplace - runge - lenz vector , computed from a hamiltonian , to obtain the spin - orbit contributions to the parameter @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we employ our generalized quasi - keplerian parametrization , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , to compute the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "there are two reasons that motivated us to do the current computation .",
    "the 2pn accurate expression for @xmath0 , derived by damour and schfer , valid for arbitrary masses and spins , is extremely important due to the discovery of the double pulsar psr j07373039 @xcite .",
    "this is because the accurate timing of the double pulsar over a period of few years should lead to the measurement of the moment of inertia of one of the pulsars @xcite .",
    "it is from the measurement of @xmath0 to 2pn order , which includes leading order spin - orbit contributions , that one will be able to measure the moment of inertia of the fast rotating pulsar in this double pulsar @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the moment of inertia of a neutron star for the first time will lead to strong constrains on its equation of state @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath0 , as mentioned earlier , using keplerian - type parametrization with the aim of presenting an alternative way of obtaining this observable quantity .",
    "a second reason for computing @xmath0 is the existence of certain intriguing features appearing in our parametrization .",
    "we observed that the factor that modulates the true anomaly , due to spin - orbit interaction , contains a contribution , independent of the spins themselves , and of 1pn order [ see eq .",

    "( 5.7 ) in ref .",
    "therefore , it is possible to describe the binary dynamics in terms of one of the eccentricities .",
    "we emphasize that , while adapting the parametrization to describe the binary dynamics , care should be taken to restrict orbital elements to the required pn order .",
    "we are aware that the above parametrization does not lead to the classic keplerian parametrization simply by putting @xmath85 .",
    "the detailed explanation of the nonspinning limit and the apparent lack of a _ simple _ nonspinning limit is given in sec .",

    "the above parametric solution is usually refered to as the genaralized quasi - keplerian parametrization for the pn accurate orbital dynamics of spinning compact binaries .",
    "it extends the computations of damour , deruelle , schfer , and wex @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that the parametric solution , given by eqs .  ",
    ", describes the entire conservative pn accurate dynamics of a spinning compact binary in an eccentric orbit , when the spin effects are restricted to the leading order spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this means the parametrization consistently describes not only the precessional motion of the orbit inside the orbital plane , but also the precessional motions of the orbital plane and the spins themselves .",
    "further , the deterministic nature of the dynamics described by the hamiltonian , given by eq .   and treated as a self - contained dynamical system , naturally follows from the above parametric solution .    in the next section ,",
    "we develop the basics required to compute @xmath0 from our parametrization .",
    "in this section , we will introduce two new triads , in terms of which it will be easy to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "we will also discuss in detail how to connect these triads and hence the parametrization expressed in terms of these triads .",
    "as we are interested in computing @xmath0 using our parametrization , it is natural that we introduce a periastron - based triad @xmath86 .",
    "later , we will express the relative separation vector @xmath87 , given by eq .",
    ", in terms of this new triad .",
    "let us introduce this periastron - based triad in a pedagogical way .",
    "we start by writing the angle @xmath88 , given by eq .",
    ", in the following way @xmath89 remember , @xmath88 is the polar angle inside the orbital plane measured from the line of nodes @xmath32 , associated with the intersection of the orbital plane with the invariable plane @xmath33 , and @xmath2 is the `` true anomaly '' , i.e. , the angle between the ( instantaneous ) periastron and the position of the relative separation vector @xmath87 .",
    "the angle @xmath90 may be considered as the `` argument of the periastron '' , i.e. , the angle between the line of nodes @xmath32 and the ( instantaneous ) periastron . by comparing eqs .   and",
    ", we can easily infer the parametric evolution for @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that the angle @xmath90 contains via @xmath56 the secular contributions to the periastron advance .    inserting eq .   into eq .",
    "and making use of familiar trigonometric relations leads to @xmath91 where the new basic vectors are given by    @xmath92    now , it is obvious that @xmath93 is the unit vector pointing towards the ( instantaneous ) periastron , as @xmath87 is periodic in the angular variable @xmath2 with period @xmath94 in these new basic vectors @xmath93 and @xmath95 .",
    "hence it is straightforward to define the periastron - based orthonormal triad @xmath96 , by rotating the @xmath31 frame around the orbital angular momentum unit vector @xmath35 , by an angle @xmath90 .",
    "this gives us @xmath97 where @xmath90 is the angle between @xmath32 and the ( instantaneous ) periastron unit vector @xmath93 , as explained above .",
    "the periastron - based vectors @xmath98 are co - rotating with the precessing ( instantaneous ) newtonian ellipse .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour of a body fixed reference system usually encountered in classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "hence , the set of angles @xmath99 is equivalent to the eulerian angles defined there .    in the next subsection",
    ", we will introduce an observer - based triad and investigate how to connect the observer and periastron - based triads .",
    "the second new triad that we introduce is a fixed one associated with the observer on earth and denoted by @xmath100 . in this fixed triad @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "are two orthogonal unit vectors in the plane of the sky , i.e. , the plane transverse to the radial direction @xmath103 , pointing from the source ( compact binary ) to the observer ( see fig .  [ fig:3fullplanes ] ) .    in order to compute @xmath0 using our parametrization ,",
    "it is natural to expect that we need to connect the periastron - based triad @xmath86 to the observer triad @xmath100 .",
    "it is possible to connect these two frames with the help of rotational matrices quite similar to the way in which the @xmath31 frame was connected to the @xmath100 frame in ref .",

    "we note , that the approach to generate the @xmath86 frame via these rotations may be also adapted for scenarios , where the angle @xmath43 depends on time .",
    "the constant behaviour of @xmath43 is a direct consequence of choosing two distinct cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , where our parametrization is valid and hence we will use the fact that @xmath43 is constant only at the end of our analysis .    it should be noted that there are other possible ways to connect the orthonormal triads @xmath100 and @xmath86 . a second way to generate the @xmath86 frame",
    "is described in great detail by damour and schfer in sec .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite and involves _ three _ rotational matrices .",
    "this way is closely linked to the observation as it involves rotational matrices defined with the help of the observational longitude of periastron @xmath111 and the orbital inclination angle @xmath112 .",

    "this subsection deals with the computation of @xmath123 , arising due to spin - orbit interaction , using our keplerian - type parametrization .",
