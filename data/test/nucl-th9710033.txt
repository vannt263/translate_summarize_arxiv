    "an aspect of great importance in nuclear structure calculations at any excitation energy concerns with the role of the effective interaction . at low energies this problem has generated a considerable body of work in the last twenty years . on the contrary , this is a question not studied yet in deep in the literature for higher energies .",
    "giant resonances show an intricate mixture of multipolarities and the study of how the interaction affects it is a difficult task . in the quasi ",
    "elastic peak region , the problem of the longitudinal and transverse separation has occupied most of the investigations carried out till now and the discussion of the effects due to changes in the effective interaction have not been considered in detail .    as an example , we mention the considerable number of random  phase approximation ( rpa ) type calculations performed in this energy region , much of them using residual interactions which include basically a zero  range term plus meson  exchange potentials corresponding to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and , eventually , other mesons  @xcite@xcite .",
    "an important point concerning the interaction refers to the values chosen for the parameters entering in the zero  range piece .",
    "however , and to the best of our knowledge , only in ref .",
    "@xcite a certain discussion relative to the effects of varying these parameters can be found .",
    "in fact , the common practice is to pick an interaction from the literature , which usually corresponds to a parameterization fixed for low energy calculations , and afterwards use it to evaluate quasi ",
    "free observables sometimes without taking care of the effective theory in which the interaction was adjusted .",
    "it is obvious that , to a certain level , doubtful results are possible because of the known link between effective theory and interaction .    in this work",
    "we want to address this question and investigate if different parametrizations of the interaction can produce noticeable differences in the results and the extent to which the use of an interaction fixed for a given effective theory affects the results obtained within a different one . in sec .",
    "ii we give the details about the effective theories and interactions used to perform the calculations . in sec .",
    "iii we show and discuss the results we have obtained .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "the first interaction we consider in this work is the so  called jlich ",
    "stony brook interaction  @xcite which is an effective force widely used for calculations in the quasi  elastic peak .",
    "it is given as follows : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a zero  range force of landau  migdal type , which takes care of the short  range piece of the nn interaction : @xmath4 \\ , .\\ ] ] on the other hand , a finite  range component generated by the ( @xmath0 + @xmath1)meson exchange potentials is also included .",
    "the tilde in @xmath5 means that the bare @xmath1exchange potential is slightly modified in order to take into account the effect of the exchange of more massive mesons .",
    "in particular , a factor @xmath6 is multiplying the finite  range non  tensor piece of the potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this force was fitted to reproduce low energy magnetic properties in the lead region ( specifically , magnetic resonances in @xmath7pb and magnetic moments and transition probabilities in the neighboring nuclei ) .",
    "the calculations were performed in the framework of the rpa and woods  saxon single  particle wave functions were used in the configuration space .",
    "the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( with @xmath10  mev  @xmath11 ) were found to be adequate to describe the properties studied .",
    "as previously stated , this interaction has been considered in different calculations in the quasi ",
    "elastic peak ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the problem arise because some of them have been done within the fermi gas ( fg ) formalism , with local density approximation to describe finite nuclei , in the ring approximation ( ra ) , where the exchange terms are not taken into account , and with the full unmodified @xmath12exchange potential . under these circumstances",
    ", the possible effects in the nuclear responses due to the inconsistency between the model and the effective interaction could be non ",
    "this is precisely the first aspect we want to investigate . to do that we compare the responses obtained with the jlich ",
    "stony brook interaction with those calculated with a second effective force of the form : @xmath13 by considering the same values for the zero  range parameters in both cases . the force in eq .",
    "( [ int - ii ] ) only differs from @xmath14 in the @xmath1-potential which , in this case , does not include any reduction factor . both rpa and ra effective theories",
    "are used to analyze the results .",
    "a second question of interest to us is to determine how the change of the zero  range parameters affects the responses calculated within a given theory .",
    "this will inform us about the necessity of considering or not in detail the role of these parameters .",
    "this aspect is analyzed by considering @xmath15 with parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 fixed , as in the case of the jlich  stony brook interaction , to reproduce some low energy properties in the lead region ( see details in the next section ) .",
    "it is worth to point out that @xmath15 is precisely the interaction used in practice in much of the calculations mentioned above and that is why we want to use it for this analysis .",
    "our analysis focuses on the transverse response functions in the quasi  elastic peak .",
    "we will not consider the longitudinal ones because they are strongly influenced by the spin independent pieces of the interaction ( in particular , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 channels ) and these are difficult to fix at low energy because of the role played by the scalar mesons not usually taken into account .",
    "the investigation of the various questions we are interested in has been carried out by comparing different calculations of the transverse ( e , e ) responses in @xmath20ca for three different momentum transfer ( @xmath21 , 410 and 550  mev/@xmath22 ) .",
    "( 100,180)(35,0 ) ( 0,0 )    .",
    "transverse nuclear responses for @xmath20ca , calculated for the three momentum transfers we have considered in this work .",
    "dotted lines correspond to an rpa calculation with @xmath14 , while solid curves represent the ra results for @xmath15 . in both cases the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( with @xmath10  mev  @xmath11 )",
    "have been used .",
    "dashed curves give the free fg responses .",
    "in all the calculations a value of @xmath23  mev/@xmath22 has been used .",
    "first we have study the effects produced when an effective interaction , which has been determined in a given effective theory ( e.g. rpa ) , is used to calculate ( e , e ) transverse responses in a different framework ( e.g. ra ) .    by considering the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite ( that is @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10  mev  @xmath11 ) , we have carried out two different calculations , the results of which are shown fig .  1 . therein , solid curves correspond to the calculations performed in the fg approach within the ra and with the interaction @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ int - ii ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "dotted lines have been obtained within the rpa , also for the fg .",
    "the model used in this case is the one developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which , contrary to what happens for the ra approach , includes explicitly the exchange terms in the rpa expansion . in this case",
    "we have used the interaction @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ int - i ] ) and we have adopted the factor @xmath6 , which is consistent with the parameterization used . also in fig .  1",
    ", we have plotted the free fg responses for comparison ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the first comment one can draw from these results is that the use of the interaction , as it was fixed at low energy , leads to transverse responses which are quite different from those obtained in the ra ( with @xmath15 ) calculation , though the differences reduce with increasing momentum transfer .",
    "as we can see , the results obtained in the rpa are peaked at lower energies and this is a clear evidence of a more attractive residual interaction . it is straightforward to check this point because the central piece of the @xmath14 is attractive , while the contrary happens for @xmath15 , at least for @xmath24 . on the other hand",
    "it is interesting to note how the ra results are more similar to the free response as long as @xmath25 increases , while the same does not occurs for the rpa responses .",
    "obviously , the reason for the discrepancies between both calculations can be ascribed to the two basic ingredients of the effective theories used in each case : the exchange terms , which are included in the rpa calculations but not in the ra ones , and the reduction factor @xmath26 modifying the @xmath12exchange potential .    before going deeper in this question",
    ", it is worth to comment on the nuclear wave functions used in the calculations discussed above . as in any fg type calculation ,",
    "plane  waves have been considered here to describe the single  particle states .",
    "the fact that the interaction was fixed in a framework which considered microscopic rpa wave functions , based on woods ",
    "saxon single  particle states , is an obvious inconsistency . despite that ,",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that , in this energy region , the details concerning the nuclear wave functions are not extremely important and , at least to some extent , the shell  model response can be reasonably described with the fg model , provided an adequate value of the fermi momentum , @xmath27 , is used . in the present work , where we study the response in @xmath20ca",
    ", we have taken @xmath23  mev/@xmath22 which gives a good agreement between fg and finite nuclei calculations  @xcite .",
    "we come back to investigate the reasons for the large discrepancy between the rpa and ra calculations presented above . to do that we have done two new calculations : ra with @xmath14 and rpa with @xmath15 .",
    "these calculations have been compared with the two previous ones by means of the two following quantities : @xmath28 and @xmath29 the first one gives us information about the effect of the consideration of the exchange terms in the calculation .",
    "the corresponding results have been plotted in fig .  2 ( left panels ) .",
    "the first aspect to be noted is that the exchange terms produce effects considerably larger for @xmath14 ( solid lines ) than for @xmath15 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "these effects reduce with increasing momentum transfer and they are rather small for @xmath15 above @xmath30  mev/@xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of the reduction factor @xmath26 in the @xmath1exchange potential is measured with the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the values of this parameter for the two effective models considered , these are rpa and ra , are shown in fig .  2 ( right panels ) , with solid and dashed curves respectively .",
    "it is apparent that the effects of considering the @xmath26 factor are much larger than those due to the exchange . in general",
    "they are more important for the ra calculations than for the rpa ones , and reduce the higher @xmath25 is .",
    "( 100,180)(30,0 ) ( 0,0 )    . left panels : @xmath32 , in percentage , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ relexc ] ) . dashed ( solid )",
    "curves give the results obtained for @xmath33 .",
    "right panels : @xmath31 , in % , calculated as in eq .",
    "( [ relfac ] ) , for rpa ( solid curves ) and ra ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the first conclusion to be noted is that when using a given interaction is mandatory to take care of the effective theory where its parameterization was fixed .",
    "the change of the framework produces results which could not be under control .",
    "the open question in this respect is how different becomes the responses calculated within different effective theories but with an interaction fixed consistently with the theory .",
    "this is the second aspect we investigate . to do that we have considered the @xmath15 and have determined the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the landau ",
    "migdal piece in such a way that the energies and b - values of the two @xmath34 states in @xmath7pb at 5.85 and 7.30  mev are reproduced .",
    "this has been done both in rpa and ra .",
    "the reason for choosing these two states lies in their respective isoscalar and isovector character , what makes them particularly adequate to permit the determination of both parameters almost independently .",
    "the values obtained in this procedure are shown in table  i. it is remarkable the small value of @xmath16 needed for the ra calculation .",
    "a similar result is found when a pure zero  range landau ",
    "migdal interaction is adjusted , with the same criterion , in rpa type calculations ( see refs .",
    "this points out the importance of the exchange , at least at low energy .",
    "values of the landau ",
    "migdal parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 obtained in the procedure of fixing the effective interaction @xmath15 ( see text ) .",
    "the values quoted `` rpa '' ( `` ra '' ) correspond to calculations performed with ( without ) the consideration of the exchange terms .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the interaction fixed in this way we have evaluated the transverse responses for the three momentum transfer we are considering throughout this work .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 where dotted ( solid ) curves correspond to the rpa ( ra ) calculations .",
    "dashed lines represent the free fg responses .",
    "as we can see , the differences between the results obtained with the two effective theories are now much smaller than in fig .  1 .",
    "( 100,180)(35,0 ) ( 0,0 )    .",
    "transverse nuclear responses for @xmath20ca , calculated with the @xmath15 interaction .",
    "dotted lines correspond to an rpa calculation while solid curves represent the ra results .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in table  i have been used .",
    "dashed curves give the free fg responses .",
    "in all the calculations a value of @xmath23  mev/@xmath22 has been used .",
    "two points deserve a comment .",
    "first , it is clear that the large differences observed between the rpa calculation here discussed and that shown in fig",
    ".  1 are mainly due to the presence of the reduction factor @xmath6 in the @xmath14 interaction .",
    "second , the similitude of the results obtained with the two calculations done now with @xmath15 , shows up the relevance of the link between effective theories and interactions .",
    "the last aspect we want to analyze is how the responses calculated in a given approach change when the zero  range parameters are modified . in other words ,",
    "we want to determine what is the role of these parameters .",
    "how @xmath17 affects the responses is a point which has been investigated with a certain detail in different previous works ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and then we focus here in @xmath16 . its influence can be seen in fig .  4 , where we compare the responses plotted in fig .  3 ( solid curves ) , with those obtained by changing the @xmath16 parameter in order to use values considered by different authors . dashed  dotted curves correspond to @xmath35 .",
    "dashed lines represent the responses obtained with @xmath36 ( 0.57 ) for the rpa ( ra ) calculation .",
    "the values of @xmath17 have not been changed .",
    "the first point to be noted is the insensibility of the ra responses to the changes in @xmath16 .",
    "as we can see , strong changes in @xmath16 produce almost no effect on the ra result .",
    "this can be easily understood because in the ring series the @xmath16 contribution is weighted with the magnetic moment @xmath37 while the @xmath17 piece appears with @xmath38 .",
    "that means , the @xmath16 contribution is @xmath39 of the @xmath17 contribution .",
    "the situation is different in the rpa case , where the @xmath16 contribution is as important as the @xmath17 one because of the presence of the exchange terms ( see ref .",
    "this makes that some of the ra calculations performed by other authors can be considered as `` consistent '' in practice , of course despite the fact that these parametrizations are unable to reproduce low energy properties .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parameterization of the jlich  stony brook interaction was considered and this coincides with one of those used here ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the results obtained in this work open a series of questions which we consider worth for nuclear calculations in this energy region . in the following we enumerate and comment them :    ( 100,170)(24,0 ) ( 0,0 )    .",
    "@xmath40 responses calculated in the rpa ( left panels ) and ra ( right panels ) .",
    "solid curves correspond to the parametrizations of table  i. dashed  dotted curves have been obtained with @xmath35 , while the dashed ones correspond to @xmath36 ( 0.57 ) for the rpa ( ra ) calculation , with the same values of @xmath17 as for the solid curves .    1 .",
    "it has been shown that the strength of the tensor piece of @xmath14 is too strong to describe low energy properties ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and different mechanisms have been proposed to cure this problem ( core  polarization effects  @xcite , two  particles two  holes excitations  @xcite , _ in  medium _ scaling law  @xcite , etc . )",
    "the role of the tensor part of the interaction in the quasi - elastic peak should be investigated in order to establish the effective force to be used .",
    "the presence of the exchange terms increase the sensitivity of the responses to the details of the interaction",
    ". how important can be the interference between these terms and other physical mechanisms basic in this energy region ( such as , e.g. , meson  exchange currents , final state interactions , short  range correlations , etc . ) is a matter of relevance in order to fully understand the nuclear response .",
    "the analysis of the possible differences between ra and rpa with respect to these effects is of special interest in view of the fact that ra calculations are the most usual in the quasi",
    " elastic peak .",
    "the procedure of fixing the interaction is basic in order to deal with the possibility of having an unique framework to calculate the nuclear response at any momentum transfer and excitation energy .",
    "the problem of developing such `` unified '' model is still unsolved , but the cross analysis of low energy nuclear properties and quasi  elastic peak responses could give valuable hints .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the role of the effective interaction in the quasi ",
    "elastic peak region by comparing the results obtained with different effective theories and forces previously fixed in order to give a reasonable description of several low energy nuclear properties .",
    "some conclusions can be drawn after our analysis .",
    "first , it has been found that the interaction plays a role that , similarly to what happens at low excitation energy , can not be neglected .",
    "the particular point to be noted is the necessity of using effective interactions which have been fixed within an effective theory .",
    "second , the procedure we have followed to perform the calculations , that is to determine the interaction at low energy before calculating at the quasi ",
    "elastic peak , seems to be adequate to look for an `` unique '' framework to calculate the nuclear response in different energy and momentum regimes .",
    "the role of the tensor piece of the interaction must be investigated . at low energy",
    "is a basic ingredient of the nuclear structure calculations .",
    "thus it is important to disentangle its contribution in other excitation energy regions .",
    "additionally , it seems encouraging to analyze the problem by including other physical mechanisms ( meson  exchange currents , short  range correlations , final state interactions , etc . ) which are known to be important in the description of the nuclear response and which depend on the interaction .",
