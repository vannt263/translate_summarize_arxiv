    "the @xmath3 symmetry of the order parameter ( op ) in high temperature ( high-@xmath4 ) superconductors is nowadays well established by various phase - sensitive experiments , the most striking being the observation of a half flux quantum in a tricrystal geometry by tsui _",
    "et al . _",
    "also the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) found in different tunnel experiments  @xcite on @xmath5$]-oriented boundaries of yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 gave a strong hint for @xmath0-wave symmetry as was first pointed out by hu  @xcite .",
    "however , in more recent experiments , several puzzling questions arose .",
    "for example a splitting of the zbcp was observed  @xcite and zbcp s were reported even for @xmath9$]-oriented junctions  @xcite .",
    "disorder effects were examined as well in experiment where the disorder of the junctions was increased by ion irradiation  @xcite .",
    "a decreasing height of the zbcp was observed whereas the width stayed constant .",
    "the most successful approach to treat such inhomogeneous problems is the theory of quasiclassical green s functions  @xcite .",
    "the properties of surfaces or interfaces are included by effective boundary condition .",
    "for a specular surface the green s function has to be continuous on a classical trajectory ( see fig .  [ spec ] ) . in this most simple model the pair - breaking effect of surfaces as well as the existence of a zbcp",
    "can be explained : if quasiparticles are scattered to branches with a different op ( @xmath10 ) the pairing is suppressed and bound states can occur due to andreev scattering . if a quasiparticle is scattered with a sign change of the op the zbcp exists , too . in this framework",
    "it was also shown  @xcite that the splitting of the zbcp is in agreement with the existence of a subdominant order parameter ( @xmath11 ) in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "the generalization of the boundary conditions to a specular interface was carried out by zaitsev  @xcite . in this situation",
    "the green s function on four trajectories must match at the interface , which leads to quite complicated non - linear boundary conditions .",
    "as surface roughness is present in experiments , models were developed to include disorder in the theory .",
    "one possibility , first suggested by ovchinnikov  @xcite , is to use the boundary conditions for the specular situation and cover the surface with a thin dirty layer where equations for the dirty case must be applied . in numerical studies of boundary problems",
    "similar techniques were used  @xcite . also a scattering matrix approach , which is related to the randomly rippled wall model  @xcite ,",
    "was applied to disordered surfaces  @xcite ; the solution was given in a born - like approximation .",
    "except for models with unitary scatterers  @xcite , all calculations show a broadening of the zbcp due to disorder .",
    "often the surface roughness is only present on scales much smaller than the coherence length . in this case , the boundary conditions for the quasiclassical green s function can be formulated in terms of the scattering matrix ( @xmath12-matrix ) , as it has been recently suggested in  @xcite .",
    "a rough interface does not conserve the momentum parallel to the surface , and , therefore , it couples waves ( _ i.e. _ quasiclassical trajectories ) with different propagation direction .",
    "the microscopic structure of the interface enters the theory via the @xmath12-matrix . in the absence of detailed knowledge about the microscopic structure of the surface",
    ", the @xmath12-matrix has to be taken as a phenomenological input .    due to the very short in - plane coherence length in high-@xmath4 superconductors ( @xmath13 ) structures on larger scales",
    "occur as well .",
    "then the translational invariance parallel to the surface is lost on this length scale and a full 2d treatment of the problem is necessary , in which the trajectories are considered individually ( see fig .  [ coh - inc ] ) .",
    "for example , in cuprates facets with typical dimensions of @xmath14 are present at interfaces  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the existence of a zbcp even for [ 100 ] tunnel junctions as was pointed out by fogelstrm _",
    "et al . _",

    "in our study we use the scattering matrix approach presented in  @xcite to describe surfaces with microscopic roughness .",
    "we will discuss two kinds of surfaces : first , we study a microscopically disordered surface , which is described by random matrices .",
    "in contrast to earlier calculations we are able to consider individual realizations of the disorder ; we examine averaged quantities as well as fluctuations .",
    "afterwards we focus on an @xmath12-matrix that describes a surface with tilted mirrors , where few trajectories are connected at the surface .    in the following section we will briefly introduce the quasiclassical theory for superconductors .",
    "subsequently we will present the boundary conditions in the form most suitable for our purpose and discuss the general properties . in section  [ ressurf ]",
    "we derive the s - matrices for different situations and present the related results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and compare them to other approaches .",
    "in our studies of boundary effects of unconventional superconductors we use the theory of quasiclassical green s functions introduced by eilenberger  @xcite .",
    "this approximation of gorkov s theory is valid in the quasiclassical limit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "several review articles have been written on this subject , e.g. by schmid  @xcite or larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite .",

    "[ dom4 ] we also present the case @xmath140 with @xmath141 different mirrors for the surface orientations @xmath101 .    summing up our observations for the @xmath104 case small mirrors reduce the spectral weight of the zero energy bound states as a part splits to finite energies .",
    "for the surface orientation @xmath106 in general ( except some particular situations ) no zero energy bound state is produced .",
    "finally we point out that a larger class of @xmath12-matrices can be used to describe such surfaces @xmath142 this model has almost the same properties as  ( [ h - fac ] ) , however , the scattering probabilities for each mirror differ .",
    "moreover it is possible to combine the these mirrors with disorder just by multiplying the related @xmath12-matrices and averaging as in section  [ ransurf ] .",
    "in the present paper , the scattering matrix approach has been applied to describe @xmath0-wave superconductors in the vicinity of rough surfaces .",
    "two physical situations are examined : ( i ) a surface with partially diffusive reflection described by random scattering matrices ; ( ii ) a surface with small tilted mirrors ( facets ) where the reflected wave is a coherent mixture of waves propagating in several directions .",
    "first , for the diffusive surface it appears that our results are very similar to those found in other approaches such as the randomly rippled wall model  @xcite or the thin dirty layer  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those calculations we treated the disorder by direct sampling .",
    "we find that the deviation of the dos from the average is rather small .",
    "therefore , our calculations confirm the validity of averaging procedures used in the afore - mentioned papers .",
    "in particular the broadening of the zbcp due to increasing disorder is no artifact of the approximate averaging .",
    "( other models exist that show no such broadening  @xcite . )",
    "second , we studied a surface with tilted mirrors .",
    "in contrast to the model for large facets examined in  @xcite , our model describes a surface where faceting occurs on a scale small compared to the coherence length .",
    "these two models provide qualitatively different results : our model in general shows no zbcp for @xmath143 , whereas large facets lead to a zbcp for each surface orientation .    in experiments on high-@xmath4 materials",
    ", it can not be excluded that roughness on a scale of the coherence length or larger occurs , which is beyond the model used in the current paper .",
    "this might be the case in the experiment described in  @xcite , where the width of the zbcp is constant with varying disorder . in some experiments  @xcite a zbcp for @xmath143",
    "is observed , too , consistent with the model for large facets  @xcite .",
