    "various mathematical problems can be formulated as finding a common fixed point of finitely many firmly nonexpansive mappings .",
    "these include , for instance , the convex feasibility problem  @xcite , which consists of finding a point in the intersection of a finite number of closed convex sets , or the problem of finding a common zero of a finite family of maximal monotone operators  @xcite .",
    "firmly nonexpansive mappings were introduced by bruck  @xcite in order to study sunny nonexpansive retractions onto closed subsets of banach spaces . in hilbert spaces , these mappings",
    "coincide with firmly contractive ones defined by browder  @xcite .",
    "a basic example of firmly nonexpansive mappings is the metric projection onto closed convex subsets of hilbert spaces .",
    "this mapping or finite compositions thereof appear in different iterative methods used in the study of convex minimization problems .",
    "results on the asymptotic behavior of some such methods follow from analyzing compositions of finitely many firmly nonexpansive mappings , as it is the case of the cyclic projection algorithm employed in solving the convex feasibilty problem ( see  @xcite for a deep treatment of this topic ) .",
    "another important example of firmly nonexpansive mappings is the resolvent of a monotone operator which was introduced by minty  @xcite .",
    "since the subdifferential of a proper convex lower semi - continuous function is a maximal monotone operator , some splitting methods which involve resolvents and are used to solve convex minimization problems can be abstracted to compositions of firmly nonexpansive mappings . using this approach , bauschke , combettes and reich @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) proved , in particular , that having two proper convex lower semicontinuous functions defined on a hilbert space , one can apply alternatively the two resolvents to obtain weak convergence to a solution ( provided it exists ) of a minimization problem associated to the two functions , see ( [ def - fct - min ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the convex feasibilty problem for two sets can be reformulated as a problem of type ( [ def - fct - min ] ) for both the consistent and the inconsistent case .    the most straightforward way to find a common fixed point or ,",
    "more generally , a fixed point of the composition of finitely many firmly nonexpansive mappings is to iterate the mappings cyclically .",
    "the particular case of just one mapping was considered in hilbert spaces by browder  @xcite who proved that , for any starting point , the picard iterates of a firmly nonexpansive mapping converge weakly to a fixed point , whenever the fixed point set is nonempty . although the class of firmly nonexpansive mappings is not closed under composition , in hilbert spaces firmly nonexpansive mappings are averaged and the composition of averaged mappings is averaged .",
    "thus , results for the general case of finitely many firmly nonexpansive mappings can be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of averaged mappings ( see also @xcite for a more general order of composing the mappings that still preserves weak convergence ) . in banach spaces",
    "not every firmly nonexpansive mappings is averaged and so extensions of such results to this setting are not immediate . bruck and reich  @xcite introduced strongly nonexpansive mappings that generalize firmly nonexpansive ones when the space is uniformly convex .",
    "this class of mappings is closed under composition and so one can analyze compositions of firmly nonexpansive mappings using results on the asymptotic behavior of strongly nonexpansive mappings .",
    "more recently , problems where the study of compositions of firmly nonexpansive mappings plays an important role ( such as minimization problems @xcite or abstract cauchy problems@xcite ) have also been formulated in a nonlinear setting .",
    "since our applications focus on minimizing convex functions in geodesic spaces , we mention some of the work in this direction . the proximal point method and modifications thereof for optimization problems in linear spaces",
    "have been extended to riemanninan manifolds in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "spaces of nonpositive curvature in the sense of alexandrov ( also known as cat@xmath5 spaces ) proved to be an appropriate setting for considering such problems too .",
    "jost studied the concept of resolvents for convex functions to develop the theory of harmonic mappings  @xcite which motivated bak @xcite to extend the proximal point algorithm to this context . in @xcite ,",
    "a proximal splitting algorithm was also approached in this setting ( assuming in addition local compactness ) and applied to the computation of the geometric median and the frchet mean of a finite set of points . regarding the convex feasibility problem ,",
    "results on the asymptotic behavior of the alternating projection method have been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the minimization problem ( [ def - fct - min ] ) was studied in this setting in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to create a suitable theoretical framework so that previous results can be better understood and in some cases improved . to this end",
    ", we present a systematic study of the asymptotic behavior of compositions of a finite number of firmly nonexpansive mappings in @xmath0-uniformly convex geodesic spaces .",
    "asymptotic regularity is a very important concept used in the study of the asymptotic behavior of sequences and was formally introduced by browder and petryshyn in  @xcite . in section  [ section - as - reg ] we give asymptotic regularity results for sequences obtained by applying a finite number of firmly nonexpansive mappings in a cyclic way .",
    "we assume first that they have a common fixed point , but consider also the case of two mappings which satisfy the weaker condition that their composition is not fixed point free",
    ". moreover , we use techniques which originate from proof mining ( see @xcite for more details ) to provide polynomial rates of asymptotic regularity , thus giving quantitative versions of such results and extending a corresponding result proved in @xcite .",
    "section [ section - conv ] deals with @xmath6-convergence results for these problems . assuming appropriate compactness conditions we obtain strong convergence .",
    "when the mappings have a common fixed point we apply our findings to the cyclic projection method for finitely many sets in cat@xmath1 spaces improving previous results from @xcite .",
    "we show that the results concerning two firmly nonexpansive mappings for which the fixed point set of the composition is nonempty can be used to study the minimization problem ( [ def - fct - min ] ) in cat@xmath5 spaces which partially recovers the main result of @xcite and yields a convergence result for the inconsistent convex feasibility problem for two sets .",
