    "in different contexts like biological systems or chemical reactions , many out of equilibrium dynamics combine diffusive and dissipative features which can be described macroscopically by reaction - diffusion equations . in order to analyze these systems from a microscopic point of view , a lattice gas model with fast stirring and a local creation - annihilation mechanism",
    "has been introduced in @xcite by combining a symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) and a glauber dynamics .",
    "another example of driven dissipative system is a granular gas where the energy is dissipated through inelastic collisions .",
    "direct analytic approaches of the granular gases are notoriously difficult , but stochastic toy models have been proposed in order to capture some aspects of the physics @xcite or for simulation purposes @xcite .",
    "the particle system introduced in @xcite in contact with two heat bath shares also similar features .    in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics",
    ", there is no analogous to the gibbs formalism and the large deviation functional can be viewed as a substitute for the free energy . in particular ,",
    "the large deviations of the current received a lot of attention over the last few years ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "exact expressions of the large deviation functional have been obtained for conservative diffusive stochastic dynamics in contact with reservoirs @xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize these results to the non - conservative stochastic dynamics which combine a fast stirring and a glauber dynamics as in @xcite .",
    "the relevant macroscopic parameters to describe these stochastic systems are the density , the conservative current ( from the stirring dynamics ) and the non - conservative current ( from the glauber dynamics ) . the large deviation functional",
    "gives the exponential cost of observing a deviation of these three parameters simultanously .",
    "the large deviations for the density have been already studied in @xcite and the long - range correlations of the steady state in @xcite .",
    "the large deviations of the injected power were computed for a different non - conservative stochastic dynamics in @xcite .    the large deviation functional derived in measures the cost of observing a joint deviation of the density and the currents .",
    "thus the density large deviations obtained in @xcite can be recovered from the functional by optimizing the deviations on the currents . in the same way ,",
    "observing an atypical conservative current imposes a non trivial constraint on the density and the non - conservative current . as a consequence ,",
    "we argue in section [ sec : variance ] that the local conservative current fluctuations are produced by a different mechanism than in the case of conservative dynamics .    for some choice of the glauber rates , the steady state may exhibit a phase transition .",
    "this instability of the steady state leads to a new kind of dynamical phase transition for the current which is presented in section [ sec : phase transition ] .",
    "the fluctuation relation for the entropy production has been investigated in the framework of dissipative systems in @xcite . using the exact expression of the large deviation functional , we discuss its symmetry properties with respect to time reversal and recover the fluctuation relation for the entropy production .",
    "contrary to the conservative dynamics , the entropy production is no longer proportional to the current injected in the system , but depends in a complex way on the currents and the density .",
    "to fix the idea , we first recall in section [ subsec : microscopic ] the microscopic model introduced in @xcite . as it will be clear from section [ sec : hydrodynamic limit ] , the details of the microscopic evolution will not be important to study the macroscopic limit and one can consider more general dynamics than the one introduced in section [ subsec : microscopic ] .",

    "similarly at site @xmath0 , particles are created or removed at rate @xmath12 .",
    "we stress the fact that the stirring of the particles and the action of the reservoirs is much faster ( by a factor @xmath13 ) than the creation / annihilation mechanism in the bulk .",
