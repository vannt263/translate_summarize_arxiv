    "more generally , we refer to an operator of the form @xmath6 as a _ foguel operator of order @xmath7_.    although it is clear that a foguel operator of order @xmath7 with underlying space @xmath0 can be represented as a foguel operator on the @xmath7-fold direct sum @xmath8 , we maintain the option of employing the notation since it will be convenient in what follows .",
    "the study of such operators was implicitly initiated by foguel @xcite , who provided a counterexample to a well - known conjecture of sz .-",
    "nagy @xcite .",
    "specifically , foguel demonstrated the existence of a power bounded operator which is not similar to a contraction .",
    "a simplification of foguel s construction was almost immediately produced by halmos @xcite , who explicitly introduced operators of the form .    in the years since those influential papers ,",
    "foguel operators have proved to be an almost unlimited source of counterexamples to important conjectures .",
    "most strikingly , foguel operators ( where the underlying space @xmath0 is infinite dimensional and the operator @xmath9 in is a vectorial hankel operator ) feature prominently in pisier s celebrated solution to halmos polynomially bounded operator problem @xcite . the interested reader is advised to consult the recent text ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) , the expository note @xcite , and the influential papers @xcite .    in this note , we introduce a method for computing the norm of a foguel operator @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we are also concerned with the spectral analysis of the modulus @xmath11 .",
    "recall that the _ modulus _ of a bounded operator @xmath12 is defined to be the selfadjoint operator @xmath13 .",
    "we will denote the spectrum of @xmath12 by @xmath14 .",
    "we approach this problem by considering a related system of approximate antilinear eigenvalue problems ( see lemma [ lemmaspectrum ] ) .",
    "this technique , introduced in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the class of complex symmetric operators includes all normal operators , operators defined by hankel matrices , compressed toeplitz operators ( including finite toeplitz matrices and the compressed shift ) , and the volterra integration operator .",

    "the key observation is that many foguel operators ( including foguel - hankel operators ) are complex symmetric .",

    "before proceeding , let us point out a few elementary facts about the norm and modulus of a foguel operator . for instance , it is clear that a foguel operator has nontrivial kernel since @xmath24 where @xmath25 . in particular , this implies that @xmath26 for any foguel operator .",

    "our primary result is a type of spectral mapping theorem for the modulus of a foguel operator .",
    "this not only provides us with an exact formula for the norm of a foguel operator ( corollary [ corollarynorm ] ) , it also yields a sharp upper bound on the norm of powers of a foguel operator ( corollary [ corollarypowers ] ) .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the unilateral shift on @xmath2 and let @xmath21 denote a conjugation on @xmath2 which commutes with both @xmath1 and @xmath48 ( e.g. , suppose that @xmath21 is the canonical conjugation on @xmath2 ) .",
