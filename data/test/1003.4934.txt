    "are confined into colorless hadrons ( i.e. , @xmath8 invariant configurations ) .",
    "thus , it is the chiral symmetry which predominantly determines hadronic interactions in the low - energy region .",
    "effective field theories which contain hadrons as degrees of freedom rather than quarks and gluons have been developed along two lines which differ in the way in which chiral symmetry is realized : linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite . in the non - linear realization , the so - called non - linear sigma model , the scalar states are integrated out , leaving the pseudoscalar states as the only degrees of the freedom . on the other hand , in the linear representation of the symmetry , the so - called linear sigma model , both the scalar and pseudoscalar degrees of freedom are present .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the linear representation of chiral symmetry .",
    "an exactly linearly realized chiral symmetry implies that the qcd eigenstates come in degenerate pairs , the so - called chiral partners .",
    "chiral partners have the same quantum numbers with the exception of parity and g - parity  for example , the scalar states sigma and pion and the vector states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , are chiral partners . experimental data in vacuum and at sufficiently low temperatures and densities of matter",
    ", however , show that the mass degeneracy is lifted , because the chiral @xmath13 symmetry is broken in two ways : explicitly and spontaneously .    due to the @xmath14 anomaly @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath15 symmetry is broken explicitly by quantum effects to @xmath16 . in the case of",
    "small but nonzero degenerate quark masses , the latter is explicitly broken to @xmath17 .",
    "if the quark masses are not degenerate , the @xmath17 symmetry is furthermore explicitly broken to @xmath18 , corresponding to baryon number conservation .",
    "qcd also possesses discrete symmetries such as the charge conjugation ( _ c _ ) , parity ( _ p _ ) and time reversal ( _ t _ ) symmetry ( _ cpt _ ) , which are to a very good precision separately conserved by strong interactions .",
    "this fact offers further constraints in the construction of effective models of qcd .",
    "[ a review of a possible , although small , _ cp _ violation in strong interactions may be found e.g.in ref .  @xcite . ]    in addition to the explicit breaking of axial symmetry @xmath19 due to nonzero quark masses , the latter symmetry is also spontaneously broken in vacuum by the non - vanishing expectation value of the quark condensate : @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry breaking mechanism leads to the emergence of @xmath21 pseudoscalar goldstone bosons , as well as of massive scalar states representing the chiral partners of the goldstone bosons . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the three lightest mesonic states , the pions , are identified with these goldstone bosons of qcd .",
    "their non - vanishing mass arises due to the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry , rendering them pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "in this paper we study an @xmath23 linear sigma model which contains scalar ( @xmath3 , @xmath24 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , and in addition also vector ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "usually , such models are constructed under the requirement of local chiral invariance @xmath9 , with the exception of the vector meson mass term which renders the local symmetry a global one @xcite . in a slight abuse of terminology",
    ", we will refer to these models as locally chirally invariant models in the following .",
    "a study of the qcd phase transition and its critical temperature @xmath31 within such a model can be found e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the locally invariant linear sigma model fails to simultaneously describe meson decay widths and pion - pion scattering lengths in vacuum . as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are at least two ways to solve this issue .",
    "one way is to utilize a model in which the ( up to the vector meson mass term ) local invariance of the theory is retained while higher - order terms are added to the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the second way which is pursued here is the following : we construct a linear sigma model with global chiral invariance containing all terms up to naive scaling dimension four @xcite .",
    "the global invariance allows for additional terms to appear in our lagrangian in comparison to the locally invariant case presented e.g.  in ref .",
    "we remark that , introducing a dilaton field , one can argue @xcite that chirally invariant terms of higher order than scaling dimension four should be absent .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have presented a first study of meson decays and pion - pion scattering lengths in vacuum in the framework of the globally invariant linear sigma model .",

    "their spectroscopic wave functions might contain a dominant tetraquark or mesonic molecular contribution @xcite .",
    "the correct assignment of the scalar quark - antiquark fields of the model to physical resonances is not only important as a contribution to the ongoing debate about the nature of these resonances , but it is also vital for a study of the properties of hadrons at nonzero temperature and density , where the chiral partner of the pion plays a crucial role @xcite .    it is important to stress that the theoretical @xmath3 and @xmath4 fields entering the linear sigma model describe pure quark - antiquark states , just as all the other fields ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "this property can be easily proven by using well - known large-@xmath39 results @xcite : the mass and the decay widths of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 fields scale in the model as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .    in this paper we first investigate the consequences of scenario i on various decay widths and pion - pion scattering lengths .",
    "this assignment is disfavored because a consistent description of all experimental data can not be achieved . to reach this conclusion ,",
    "vector and axial - vector degrees of freedoms play an important role . on the one hand",
    "their decays ( such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and the role of the @xmath11 meson in @xmath0 scattering provide strong constraints , on the other hand they affect , indirectly but sizably , some decay channels , such as @xmath44 .",
    "we then present a study of scenario ii . although the latter is not yet conclusive because additional scalar fields ( glueball , tetraquark ) are not yet taken into account , our preliminary results for the decay widths ( albeit not for the scattering length @xmath7 ) are consistent with the data .",

    "the parameter @xmath114 is suppressed by a factor @xmath39 although it enters quadratic mass - like terms .",

    "the parameters @xmath117 , @xmath118 also describe quartic interactions , but are further suppressed by a factor @xmath119 because of the trace structure of the corresponding terms in the lagrangian .",

    "we shall require that none of the two contributions be negative : in fact , a negative @xmath121 would imply that the system is unstable when @xmath133 ; a negative @xmath134 would imply that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking decreases the @xmath11 mass .",
    "this is clearly unnatural because the breaking of chiral symmetry generates a sizable effective mass for the light quarks , which is expected to positively contribute to the meson masses .",

    "<S> we show via a detailed comparison with experimental data that this scenario can describe all vacuum properties studied here except for the decay width of the @xmath3 , which turns out to be too small . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the alternative assignment @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the scalar mesons . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the decay width agrees with the experimental value , but the @xmath0 scattering length @xmath7 is too small . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the necessity to extend our model by additional scalar degrees of freedom . </S>"
