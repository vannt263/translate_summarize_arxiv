    "sandpile models are the prime example of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , in which a system with an absorbing - state phase transition is forced to its critical point @xcite , leading to scale - invariance in the apparent absence of parameters @xcite . the absorbing - state phase transition , which depends , as is usual , on the fine - tuning of one or more control parameters , is evident in sandpiles with a fixed number of particles @xcite , models that have come to be called fixed - energy sandpiles ( fes ) .",
    "while most studies of sandpiles have probed the driven case @xcite , there is great interest in understanding the scaling properties of fes models as well @xcite .",
    "previous studies of fes reveal that they exhibit a phase transition between an absorbing and an active state as the particle density @xmath5 ( which is the temperaturelike control parameter ) is increased beyond a critical value @xcite . until now",
    ", all quantitative results on fes have been obtained from simulations .",
    "it is therefore of interest to apply theoretical methods to such models .",
    "one such approach is suzuki s coherent anomaly method ( cam ) for analyzing a series of cluster approximations .",
    "it has been shown to yield good estimates for critical properties both in @xcite and out of equilibrium @xcite . in this work",
    "i develop @xmath6-site approximations for a one - dimensional sandpile model , and analyze the results using the cam .",
    "this represents the first application of the cam to a model representative of the class of absorbing - state phase transitions in systems with a conserved density @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i study a fes with a height restriction . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "an inconvenient feature of sandpile models is the unbounded number of particles that may occupy the same site ; this complicates attempts to derive cluster approximations . in manna s stochastic sandpile @xcite , sites with height @xmath7",
    "are active .",
    "if we restrict the height ( or number of sand grains per site ) , to be @xmath8 , the effect on critical properties should be minimal , aside from a possible shift in the critical density @xmath9 .",
    "this expectation was recently verified numerically : the restricted - height stochastic sandpile belongs to the same universality class as its unrestricted counterpart @xcite .",
    "i study the restricted - height model for calculational convenience , as a representative of a broader universality class that includes manna s stochastic sandpile , the conserved lattice gas , and the conserved threshold transfer process @xcite .",
    "the balance of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is defined in sec .",
    "ii , followed by a discussion of @xmath6-site approximations in sec .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "the cam analysis is discussed in sec .",
    "v , and in sec .",
    "vi i present a brief summary .",
    "the model is defined on a ring of @xmath10 sites with periodic boundaries .",
    "( the cluster approximations effectively study the @xmath11 limit . )",
    "the configuration is specified by the number of particles @xmath12 , or 2 at each site ; sites with @xmath13 are said to be _ active _ , and have a toppling rate of unity .",
    "the continuous - time ( sequential ) , markovian dynamics consists of a series of toppling events at individual sites . when site @xmath14 topples , two particles attempt move to randomly chosen nearest neighbors @xmath15 and @xmath16 of @xmath14 .",
    "the new position of each particle is accepted if and only if the target site has fewer than two particles .",
    "i consider a stochastic toppling rule in which the two particles move independently .",
    "any particle attempting to move to a site already harboring two particles is sent back to the toppling site .",
    "( thus an attempt to send two particles from site @xmath15 to site @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , results in @xmath19 and @xmath20 . )",
    "transition probabilities are listed in table i.    this model , and a closely related one ( with a cooperative toppling rule ) , were studied via simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that the critical exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the same as for the unrestricted manna sandpile .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in ref .",
    "@xcite for a two - dimensional restricted - height sandpile ( called the conserved threshold transfer process in that work ) .",
    "i have derived dynamic @xmath6-site cluster approximations for the one - dimensional restricted sandpile model .",
    "such approximations often yield qualitatively correct phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "the procedure parallels that used by ferreira and mendirata to study the one - dimensional contact process @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-site approximation consists of a set of coupled differential equations for the probabilities @xmath23 of each @xmath6-site configuration , @xmath24 .",
    "( there are @xmath25 such configurations , but the number of independent probabilities is @xmath26 , due to symmetries . ) the system is assumed homogeneous , so that the @xmath23 are independent of position .",
    "since transitions in a set of @xmath6 contiguous sites generally depend on sites outside the cluster , the @xmath6-site probabilities are coupled to those for @xmath27 and so on , generating an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "the @xmath6-site approximation truncates this hierarchy by approximating @xmath28-site probabilities ( for @xmath29 ) in terms of @xmath6-site _ conditional _ probabilitites . in the @xmath6-site approximation ,",
    "the joint probability for a sequence of @xmath27 sites is approximated so @xcite :    @xmath30    the equations for one- and two - site approximations are relatively simple to derive , and are described in ref .",
    "i have developed a computational algorithm capable of generating the approximation for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "each configuration @xmath31 is represented by an integer    @xmath32    the calculation begins with the generation of all configurations , corresponding to each integer from zero ( all sites empty ) up to the maximum , @xmath33 ( all sites doubly occupied ) ; the symmetry ( under inversion ) of each configuration is determined . if @xmath34 is not symmetric , then it and its mirror image @xmath35 must have the same probability , and only the smaller of @xmath34 and @xmath35 is treated explicitly , reducing the number of variables by roughly half .",
    "next , a list of all possible transitions is constructed .",
    "here it is useful to distinguish between _ central _ transitions ( involving a toppling at one of the sites 2, ... ,@xmath36 ) and _ boundary _ transitions , in which either site 1 or site @xmath6 , or one of the peripheral sites ( 0 or @xmath27 ) topples .",
    "the rate of a central transition @xmath37 is the product of a branching probability @xmath38 ( for the particles to be redistributed in a particular manner , as in table i ) , and the intrinsic toppling rate , which is unity .",
    "consider , for example , configuration @xmath39 .",
    "the transition rates associated with a toppling at the second site ( counting from the right ) , are @xmath40 = \\frac{1}{4 } , \\ ] ] @xmath41 = \\frac{1}{2 } , \\ ] ] @xmath42 = \\frac{1}{4 } .\\ ] ]    for each configuration @xmath24 , the set of allowed transitions to other states , and the associated rates , are stored . in the case of a central transition from @xmath24 to @xmath43 , the contribution to the time - derivative of the probability has the form : @xmath44 p({\\cal c}).\\ ] ] there is of course a corresponding loss term for @xmath45 : @xmath46 p({\\cal c}).\\ ] ] thus central transitions contribute to the evolution of the probability distribution precisely as in the master equation .    for boundary transitions , one does not have access to the @xmath27-site probabilitites required to mount a complete description , and so must resort to the truncation scheme embodied in eq .",
    "( [ factpa ] ) .",
    "for example , the contribution to @xmath47 due to the transition @xmath48 is @xmath49 the @xmath50 are estimated using eq .",
    "( [ factpa ] ) . for boundary transitions one stores not only the rate , but the two configurations ( aside from the original one , @xmath24 ) whose probabilities are needed to evaluate @xmath51 . with this information available",
    ", one can evaluate the derivatives @xmath51 for all possible configurations , given the probability distribution .",
    "the evolution of the probability distribution is found via numerical integration , using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme @xcite .",
    "the integration is halted when a stationary distribution is attained , that is , when the time - derivatives @xmath51 all have an absolute value smaller than @xmath52 ( typically , @xmath53 ) .",
    "an interesting technical point concerns the evaluation of the @xmath36-site marginal distribution .",
    "there are evidently two equivalent expressions that may be used : @xmath54 and @xmath55 numerical stability is _ greatly enhanced _ using the _ mean _ of the two expressions given above .    for sizes",
    "@xmath56 , very near the critical point , relaxation to the stationary distribution is very slow , and the following procedure proves advantageous . let @xmath57 be the largest derivative ( in absolute value ) .",
    "the properties of interest ( principally , the active - site density ) are recorded as a function of @xmath58 , and the integration halted when @xmath59 .",
    "1 shows the result for the active site density , for @xmath60 slightly above @xmath9 .",
    "the stationary value is obtained via extrapolation to @xmath61 , usually via a quadratic fit to the four data points for smallest @xmath58 . ( the resulting correction is typically less than 1% of the value at @xmath62 . )",
    "i also studied the order parameter relaxation rate @xmath63 for each @xmath6 at a series of @xmath5 values near , but below , @xmath9 .",
    "these data are used to estimate the critical exponent @xmath64 in sec .",
    "i derived cluster approximations for @xmath1 sites , yielding the stationary active - site density @xmath65 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6-site approximation predictions for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 to 11 ) are compared against simulation in fig .",
    "2 ; the theoretical curves appear to approach the simulation result systematically .    for each @xmath6 ,",
    "the active - site density is zero below a certain critical value , @xmath68 .",
    "since the phase transition in the stochastic sandpile is continuous @xcite , one expects the same to be true of the cluster approximations .",
    "this is indeed the case for @xmath69 , but for @xmath70 , 6 and 7 there is a very small discontinuity in @xmath65 ( @xmath71 , invisible on the scale of fig .",
    "2 ) , as we decrease @xmath5 .",
    "since the same procedure is used for all @xmath6 , the discontinuity is unlikely to be artefact of the numerical method .",
    "on the other hand , i do not regard the discontinuity as physically significant ; it appears to represent an unphysical feature of the cluster approximations for certain @xmath6 values , very near the critical density . in the cam analysis",
    "i disregard the behavior of @xmath65 in the immediate vicinity of @xmath68 , and instead analyze its properties at points somewhat removed from the transition",
    ".    there remains , naturally , the problem of estimating the critical density , @xmath68 .",
    "for each @xmath6 i determine the critical density by fitting the four or five data points nearest the transition , where @xmath72 or less . in each case , i plot @xmath73 versus @xmath74 , varying @xmath68 to obtain the best power - law fit .",
    "the associated slopes vary between 1 ( for @xmath75 ) and about 0.25 ( for @xmath76 ) , but these , again , are regarded as unimportant details of the approximation in question .",
    "it is important to stress that , in the cases where the transition is apparently discontinuous , the difference between the location of the discontinuity and the extrapolated value of @xmath68 is less than one part in 10@xmath77 , and that the estimates for @xmath9 and critical exponents are insensitive to these tiny differences .",
    "the values of @xmath68 obtained in this manner are listed in table ii .    using the results for @xmath68",
    ", i estimate @xmath78 by plotting @xmath79 versus @xmath80 in a double - logarithmic plot , varying @xmath9 to obtain the best power - law fit .",
    "the latter is obtained using @xmath9 in the range 0.929 - 0.931 , yielding @xmath2 , in good agreement with the simulation result of 0.92965 @xcite .",
    "the finite - size scaling prediction for the critical point shift is @xcite : @xmath81 .",
    "i obtain a good fit to the data ( see fig .",
    "3 ) using @xmath82 ( as found in simulations @xcite ) , including a correction to scaling term : @xmath83 the numerical data are consistent with the simulation estimate for @xmath22 , but not sufficient to furnish an independent estimate of the exponent .",
    "a detailed explanation of the cam procedure is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it may be understood on the basis of finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "the approach here parallels that used by tom and de oliveira in their study of the domany - kinzel model @xcite . to begin",
    ", one argues that the cluster size @xmath6 plays the role of an effective system size @xmath10 as regards scaling properties .",
    "this is because the @xmath6-site approximation effectively cuts off correlations of range @xmath84 ( notwithstanding the fact that cluster approximations nominally treat an infinite system ) .",
    "thus , as noted above , one expects a critical point shift @xmath85 .",
    "finite - size scaling theory also yields the relation @xmath86 for the order parameter in a finite system , at the ( true ) critical point . for @xmath87",
    ", @xmath88 is a smooth function .",
    "thus we are led to a scaling hypothesis for the order parameter @xcite :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is a scaling function with @xmath91 . if we suppose that @xmath92 for @xmath93 , then @xmath94 , where the amplitude @xmath95 diverges as @xmath96 :    @xmath97    this is the usual cam relation . on the other hand",
    ", the hypothesis that @xmath6 is equivalent to a finite system size leads directly to :    @xmath98    this expression involves the behavior of the @xmath6-site approximation at the critical point @xmath9 not @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hypothesis of an effective system size directly proportional to @xmath6 is not strictly necessary .",
    "the scaling relations involving @xmath99 follow from the more general hypothesis of an effective system size @xmath100 , for example @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "as noted above , the @xmath6-site approximations for the order parameter @xmath103 are not all well behaved in the vicinity of @xmath68 . for this reason ,",
    "analysis of @xmath103 at @xmath68 will not yield a consistent set of well defined amplitudes @xmath95 .",
    "but since @xmath104 is well behaved for @xmath87 , we can study its scaling at some point intermediate between @xmath68 and @xmath9 . in particular , the scaling hypothesis eq .",
    "( [ schyp ] ) implies that if we fix @xmath105 , then    @xmath106    our strategy is to analyze the order parameter data reasonably near the @xmath6-site critical value , but away for @xmath68 itself , where @xmath103 is singular . a crucial point in this analysis",
    "is the postulate that the mean - field exponent @xmath107 , _ regardless of the behavior of _ @xmath103 _ in the immediate vicinity of _ @xmath68 .",
    "the motivation for this assumption is , firstly , that @xmath108 is clearly unity for @xmath109 , 2 , or 3 ; secondly , that a critical exponent such as @xmath21 is determined , in mean - field theory , by symmetry properties of the order parameter , and hence should not vary with @xmath6 ; and thirdly , that @xmath110 generically for phase transitions to an absorbing state @xcite .",
    "( the basis for this last assertion is that the mean - field equation for the order parameter will have the form @xmath111 , barring some coincidence or a symmetry that renders @xmath112 and/or @xmath113 zero @xcite . )",
    "i evaluate @xmath114 ( numerically , using an interval @xmath115 ) , for fixed @xmath116 ; the results are shown in fig .",
    "least - squares linear fits to the data for @xmath117 - 11 yield , via eq .",
    "( [ scder ] ) , the value @xmath118 , where the figure in parenthesis denotes the uncertainty . using @xmath119 instead of the best estimate , 0.930 , i find @xmath120 .",
    "thus a reasonable estimate for @xmath21 is 0.41(1 ) .",
    "( a similar analysis , but evaluating the derivatives at @xmath121 , yields @xmath122 . )",
    "the above analysis is complemented with a study of @xmath123 , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ scrhc ] ) .",
    "the graph of @xmath123 versus @xmath99 shows ( on log scales , see fig .",
    "5 ) , a fair amount of curvature , making determination of @xmath21 more difficult in this case .",
    "linear fits to the data for @xmath6 = 7 - 9 , 8 - 10 , and 9 - 11 yield , respectively , @xmath21 = 0.471 , 0.460 , and 0.448 , consistent with an approach to the value of @xmath124 for large @xmath6 .",
    "verification of convergence must naturally await the evaluation of approximations for larger clusters .",
    "a further point of interest is the validity of the scaling hypothesis , eq .",
    "( [ schyp ] ) . the data collapse shown in fig",
    ". 6 , a plot of @xmath125 versus @xmath105 provides support for the hypothesis .",
    "@xcite a similar collapse is demonstrated for the domany - kinzel model . )      as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the cam approach is readily extended to dynamics .",
    "let @xmath126 be the relaxation rate in the @xmath6-site approximation , and let @xmath127 be the true relaxation rate .",
    "then we expect @xmath128 , while @xmath129 in the @xmath6-site approximation , where the mean - field exponent is @xmath130 for models with an absorbing - state phase transition @xcite .",
    "a scaling hypothesis , analogous to eq . ( [ schyp ] ) , for the relaxation rate , is @xmath131 where the scaling function @xmath132 vanishes when its argument is zero .",
    "supposing that @xmath133 , we see that @xmath134 , where the amplitude follows @xmath135    i determine the relaxation rate numerically for @xmath136 , and from these data extract the amplitudes @xmath137 . the results , shown in fig .",
    "7 , display substantial curvature on a log - log plot , so that direct determination of the critical exponent @xmath64 is not feasible .",
