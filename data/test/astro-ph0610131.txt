    "one distinctive characteristic of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is the fact that their energy flux varies along the whole electromagnetic spectrum , spanning a wide range of time - scales .",
    "indeed , flux variability is an often used criterion for agn detection ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the widely accepted canonical model , i.e. , super - massive black - hole ( smbh ) + accretion - disk ( ad ) + dusty torus ( dt ) + relativistic jets , different regions of the active nucleus",
    "are thought to contribute to the power emitted at different frequencies along the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . on the other hand ,",
    "variability time - scales strongly constrain the sizes of the emitting regions , through light - travel arguments . since , except for the mpc - scale radio - jets and lobes , the other components remain spatially unresolved to astronomical observations in the vast majority of agns , flux variability studies are thus a powerful tool to probe those innermost regions .    while most agns are variable on time - scales of a few years , blazars , i.e. , the subclass comprising bllac objects and flat - spectrum radio - quasars ( fsrq ) , display both the largest amplitudes and shorter time - scales .",
    "at optical wavelengths , long - term variations , with amplitudes of @xmath2 to @xmath3 mag along a few years have been found through extensive monitoring in several objects , such as gc0109 + 224 @xcite , ao0235 + 64 @xcite , and oj287 @xcite .",
    "optical fluctuations on time - scales spanning several days are also usually observed , although with smaller amplitudes ( e.g. , @xmath4 mag in 20 days for pks2005@xmath0489 , @xcite ; @xmath5 mag in 10 days for 3c 454.3 , @xcite ) . although photometric changes for blazars on very short time - scales were reported more than 30 years ago ( @xmath6 mag in less than 24 hs for bllac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this phenomenon remained unrecognized by most astronomers until the advent of ccd detectors , when the existence of the now called intra - night optical variability ( inov ) or _ microvariability _ was firmly established @xcite .",
    "soon it became clear that several sources could experience remarkably large intra - night fluctuations , amounting to several tenths of a magnitude in a few hours .",
    "this is the case , among others , for pks0537@xmath0441 @xcite , 3c371 @xcite , and ao0235 + 64 @xcite . for this last object ,",
    "@xcite found changes up to 0.5 mag within one night and @xmath7 mag between consecutive nights , through well - sampled @xmath8 and @xmath9 band light - curves .",
    "this was one of the most violent variability events ever observed at optical wavelengths in any blazar .",
    "the statistical incidence of microvariability in different classes of agns has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the observed optical flux in blazars originates in a part of the ad and the inner ( pc - scale ) portions of the jets . disregarding gravitational micro - lensing effects , which probably apply to a small subset of particular sources ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , three broad classes of intrinsic models may explain optical microvariability : a ) hot - spot models , involving instabilities in the ad @xcite , b ) shock - in - jet models , based on a relativistic shock - front interacting with inhomogeneities or bends in the jet @xcite , and c ) geometrical models where the jet changes its orientation relative to the observer , thus changing its doppler factor @xcite .",
    "violent phenomena as those above reported , probably rule out models based on ad instabilities , needing , instead , relativistic beaming with high doppler factors .    in recent years , several papers claimed the repeated detection of extremely violent variability events in some blazars , with amplitudes @xmath10 mag in a few tens of minutes @xcite .",
    "for example , these authors reported a 2 mag variation in @xmath11 min for the highly polarized quasar ( hpq ) pks1510@xmath0089 ; they also showed several sudden ( @xmath12 min ) `` dips '' of @xmath13 mag in the light - curve of the egret blazar oj248 ( 0827 + 243 ) .",
    "if confirmed , these extremely violent phenomena would require a complete reassessment of the mechanisms which are thought to be responsible of the energy generation in agns .",
    "as an illustration , let us mention that optical variability time - scales of a few tens of minutes would imply emitting regions smaller than the schwarzschild radius for certain objects .",
    "in contradiction to @xcite s claims , @xcite found no such extremely violent variability events in a sample of 20 egret blazars observed with @xmath14 min time - resolution along two or more nights each , showing that the discrepancies between both works probably had their origin in different methods for error control .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggested that an inappropriate choice of the comparison and control stars used for differential photometry could result in spurious fluctuations in the differential light - curve .",
    "since it is desirable to firmly establish which is the real minimum time - scale of blazar microvariability , we have undertaken an intensive monitoring campaign focused on three particular objects with previous claims of extremely violent flux variations , in order to check this behaviour independently .",
    "we have made a careful analysis of the error sources involved in the differential photometry following well - established procedures , thus producing light - curves in which the significance of any variation is quantitatively evaluated .",
    "this procedure allowed us to set on solid bases the microvariability behaviour of blazars , showing that most claimed extremely violent events , if not all , are very likely to be spurious results produced by an inappropriate error handling . in sect .",

    "the apparent extreme variability is just a spurious result .",
    "[ f_1510vespur ] ]    the preceding analysis shows that , although a certain level of intrinsic variability may be present in the target , its significance is severely overestimated when stars @xmath2 mag brighter than the target are chosen for comparison and control .",
    "we now want to test if dramatic , although spurious , variability events may be produced when still brighter stars are used . since any star more than @xmath23 mag brighter than our targets",
    "was always saturated on our images , we selected a faint , non - variable star in the field of pks1510@xmath0089  to illustrate this effect .",

    "[ f_cartas ] , and we used stars s@xmath63 and s@xmath65 as comparison and control , respectively ( s@xmath66 star  # 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we reproduce a situation where the target is @xmath67 mag fainter than the comparison star , while this last , in turn , is @xmath68 mag brighter than the control star .",
    "the result of this completely inappropriate choice of stars is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_1510vespur ] : in about one hour , the source seems to brighten by @xmath69 mag , then returning to its original flux level ; later , a spectacular `` outburst '' brightens the object by @xmath7 mag in about 35 minutes .",
    "note the stability of the control  comparison light - curve ; without any dispersion scaling , the variability confidence parameter is @xmath70 , thus giving the impression of a highly significant flux variation .",
    "however , the scaled confidence parameter is just @xmath71 , clearly establishing that no significant variability is present in the data , with any fluctuation in the object ",
    "comparison light - curve being the result of photometric errors differently affecting stars of very disparate magnitudes . in this particular case ,",
    "both `` outbursts '' coincide with sudden changes in atmospheric transparency , due to passing cirrus .",
    "several factors contribute to make errors larger during such events : a lower flux level from the star , higher sky level and its associated rms , changes in the seeing fwhm , etc .",
    "brighter stars are relatively less affected by these effects than the faint target , thus leading to the apparent variations in the differential light - curve . under different observational conditions and with different photometric techniques ,",
    "it is likely that spurious `` dips '' instead of `` outbursts '' may be produced in the light - curve .",
    "these results underscore the absolute necessity of using the method described in whenever suitable comparison and control stars can not be found .",
    "not doing so will very probably lead to spectacular , although completely false , results .    in some cases , extremely violent variability events",
    "have been claimed to be periodic @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , since the observations are periodically repeated , and , if the same inadequate photometric techniques are used , similar spurious results will be obtained .",
    "these systematic errors have generated some completely ill - motivated theoretical models @xcite .",
    "repeated claims for the detection of extremely violent optical variability in blazars have been raised up in recent years @xcite .",
    "these claimed events are characterised by fast flux changes @xmath46 mag in a few tens of minutes , and reaching up to , for example , a 2 mag variation in @xmath11 min reported for pks1510@xmath0089 .",
    "however , other studies have found that the typical minimum time - scale for such large - amplitude variations in blazars is of several hours or still larger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have thus undertaken an observational campaign , targeting the blazars pks0048@xmath0097 , pks0754@xmath1100 , and pks1510@xmath0089 , devised to shed light on this controversy .",
    "this paper presents its results , showing that , although microvariability was clearly detected in our three targets , no extremely violent optical variability event was detected along 110 hours of observation .",
    "the largest fast flux variations we detected , instead , amount to @xmath72 mag in about one hour .",
    "we show that this discrepancy is most likely due to systematic errors introduced during the observations and photometry . in particular ,",
    "the use ( without any correction ) of stars much brighter than the target for differential photometry , directly leads to an overestimation of the significance of any detected variability .",
    "moreover , under certain specific conditions , it easily gives place to spurious variability closely reproducing extremely violent microvariability events as those reported in the papers by xie and coworkers .",
    "the following recommendations should thus be followed in order to prevent against spurious variability results :    the target object must be neither underexposed , nor saturated on all science frames .",
    "differential light - curves should be made using comparison and control stars as close in magnitude as possible to the target .",
    "published standard stars in blazar fields are usually too bright for this purpose ; they should be used just for calibration to the standard system , through a few short exposure - time frames .    if no suitable stars can be selected for differential photometry , brighter ( or fainter ) stars may be used , provided that the variance of the control  comparison light - curve is properly scaled .",
    "this should be done following the method presented in ( in fact , it is _ always _ recommended to use method ) .",
    "any remarkable flux change should be critically verified , looking for cosmic - ray hits , sudden changes in atmospheric transparency , or any instrumental effect ( see also @xcite for spurious variability induced by seeing fwhm changes ) .",
    "we conclude by saying that a critical evaluation of past and future claims for extremely violent microvariability events in blazars is needed before any radical revision of blazar models be required .",
