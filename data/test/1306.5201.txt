    "coin flipping had been already known to ancient romans as a way to decide an outcome @xcite .",
    "more recently , scientists inspired by this old question , how unbiased the real ( physical ) coin is , have been studying coin dynamics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "previous studies have mainly focused on the dynamics of the flying coin assuming that it does not bounce and finding the effects of angular momentum on the final orientation .",
    "partial analysis in combination with numerical simulations of the bouncing effects has been done by vulovic and prange @xcite .",
    "it appears that this is the only reference that addressed the effect of bouncing on coin tossing .    on the other hand , there is a well developed theory of mathematical billiards : classical dynamics of a particle moving inside a bounded domain .",
    "the particle moves along straight line until it hits the boundary .",
    "next , the particle reflects from the boundary according to the fermat s law .",
    "the billiard problem originally appeared in the context of boltzman ergodic hypothesis @xcite to verify physical assumptions about ergodicity of a gas of elastic spheres .",
    "however , various techniques in billiard dynamics turned out to be useful beyond the original physical problem .",
    "the so - called unfolding technique ( which is used in this paper ) allows one to obtain estimates on the maximal number of bounces of a particle in a wedge .",
    "one could expect that the bouncing coin dynamics could be interpreted as a billiard ball problem .",
    "in this paper we consider a simpler system ( with fewer degrees of freedom ) which we call the dumbbell .",
    "the bouncing coin on a flat surface , restricted to have axis of rotation pointing in the same direction , can be modeled as a system of two masses connected with a weightless rod .",
    "the dumbbell dynamics that is studied in this article is a useful model to initiate investigation of this potentially useful relation .",
    "another motivation for the dumbbell dynamics comes from robotics exploratory problems , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "consider an automated system that moves in a bounded domain and interacts with the boundary according to some simple laws .",
    "in many applications , it is important to cover the whole region as _",
    "e.g. _ in automated vacuum cleaners such as roomba .",
    "then , a natural question arises : _ what simple mechanical system can generate a dense coverage of a certain subset of the given configuration space_. the dumbbell , compared to a material point , has an extra degree of freedom which can generate more chaotic behavior as _",
    "e.g. _ in sinai billiards .",
    "indeed , a rapidly rotating dumbbell will quickly `` forget ''",
    "its initial orientation before the next encounter with the boundary raising some hope for stronger ergodicity .    in this paper",
    ", we study the interaction of a dumbbell with the flat boundary .",
    "this is an important first step before understanding the full dynamics of the dumbbell in some simple domains . by appropriately rescaling the variables , we obtain an associated single particle billiard problem with the boundary corresponding to the collision curve ( which is piecewise smooth ) in the configuration space .",
    "the number of collisions of the dumbbell with the boundary before scattering out depends on the mass ratio @xmath0 .",
    "if this ratio is far from 1 , then the notion of adiabatic invariance can be introduced as there is sufficient time scales separation .",
    "we prove an adiabatic invariant type theorem and we describe under what conditions it can be used .    finally , we estimate the maximal number of bounces of the dumbbell with the flat boundary . +",

    "let @xmath12 be the angle measured in the counterclockwise direction from the base line through @xmath5 and to the rod .",
    "we also define the mass ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 which correspond to the distance from the center of mass to @xmath6 and to @xmath5 , respectively .        the dumbbell moves freely in the space until it hits the floor .",
    "in this system , the velocity of the center of mass in @xmath15 direction is constant since there is no force acting on the system in @xmath15 direction .",
    "thus , we may assume without loss of generality that the center of mass does not move in @xmath15 direction . with this reduction ,",
    "the dumbbell configuration space is two dimensional with the natural choice of coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "the moment of inertia of the dumbbell is given by @xmath17 introducing the total mass @xmath18 , we can write the kinetic energy of the system as @xmath19    using the relations , @xmath20 @xmath21 we find the velocities of each mass @xmath22 @xmath23      by rescaling @xmath24 , we rewrite the kinetic energy    @xmath25    by hamilton s principle of least action , true orbits extremize @xmath26    since the kinetic energy is equal to the that of the free particle , the trajectories are straight lines between two collisions . when the dumbbell hits the boundary , the collision law is the same as in the classical billiard since in @xmath27 coordinates the action is the same . using the relations @xmath28    we find the boundaries for the dumbbell dynamics in the @xmath29-@xmath12 plane : @xmath30    @xmath31    the dumbbell hits the floor if one of the above inequalities becomes an equality .",

    "according to the collision law , the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence . in our case , @xmath35 is the normal vector to the boundary @xmath39 so that @xmath40\\\\   \\vv_-&= \\left[\\yd_- , \\pdm\\right]=\\left[\\sqrt{m / i } \\ , \\ydm , \\pdm\\right].\\end{split}\\ ] ]    then , using ( [ eq : ref ] ) , we compute @xmath41 $ ] . in this way , we express the translational and the angular velocities after the collision in terms of the velocities before @xmath5 hits the floor .",
