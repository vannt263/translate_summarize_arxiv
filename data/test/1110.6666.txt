    "there is an increasing interest in the study of dynamic systems of fractional ( where `` fractional '' actually means `` non - integer '' ) order .",
    "extending derivatives and integrals from integer to non - integer order has a firm and longstanding theoretical foundation .",
    "leibniz mentioned this concept in a letter to lhopital over three hundred years ago .",
    "following lhopital s and leibniz s first inquisition , fractional calculus was primarily a study reserved to the best minds in mathematics .",
    "fourier , euler , and laplace are among the many that contributed to the development of fractional calculus . along the history",
    ", many found , using their own notation and methodology , definitions that fit the concept of a non - integer order integral or derivative .",
    "the most famous of these definitions among mathematicians , that have been popularized in the literature of fractional calculus , are the ones of riemann  liouville and grunwald  letnikov . on the other hand ,",
    "the most intriguing and useful applications of fractional derivatives and integrals in engineering and science have been found in the past one hundred years . in some cases , the mathematical notions evolved in order to better meet the requirements of physical reality .",
    "the best example of this is the caputo fractional derivative , nowadays the most popular fractional operator among engineers and applied scientists , obtained by reformulating the `` classical '' definition of riemann  liouville fractional derivative in order to be possible to solve fractional initial value problems with standard initial conditions @xcite . particularly in the last decade of the xx century , numerous applications and physical manifestations of fractional calculus have been found .",
    "fractional differentiation is nowadays recognized as a good tool in various different fields : physics , signal processing , fluid mechanics , viscoelasticity , mathematical biology , electrochemistry , chemistry , economics , engineering , and control theory ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "the fractional calculus of variations was born in 1996 with the work of riewe @xcite , and is nowadays a subject under strong current research ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fractional calculus of variations extends the classical variational calculus by considering fractional derivatives into the variational integrals to be extremized .",
    "this occurs naturally in many problems of physics and mechanics , in order to provide more accurate models of physical phenomena ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "the aims of this paper are twofold .",
    "firstly , we extend the notion of caputo fractional derivative to the fractional derivative @xmath0 , which is a convex combination of the left caputo fractional derivative of order @xmath1 and the right caputo fractional derivative of order @xmath2 .",
    "this idea goes back at least as far as @xcite , where based on the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional derivatives , the symmetric fractional derivative was introduced .",
    "approach @xcite is obtained in our framework as a particular case , by choosing parameter @xmath3 to be @xmath4 .",
    "although the symmetric fractional derivative of riemann  liouville introduced by klimek is a useful tool in the description of some nonconservative models , this type of differentiation does not seems suitable for all kinds of variational problems .",
    "indeed , the hypothesis that admissible trajectories @xmath5 have continuous symmetric fractional derivatives implies that @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the advantage of the fractional caputo - type derivative @xmath0 here introduced lies in the fact that using this derivative we can describe a more general class of variational problems .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the fractional derivative @xmath0 allows to generalize the results presented in @xcite .",
    "our second aim is to introduce the subject of multiobjective fractional variational problems .",
    "this seems to be a completely open area of research , never considered before in the literature . knowing the importance and relevance of multiobjective problems of the calculus of variations in physics , engineering , and economics ( see @xcite and the references given there ) , and the usefulness of fractional variational problems , we trust that the results now obtained will open interesting possibilities for future research .",
    "main results of the the paper provide methods for identifying pareto optimal solutions . necessary and sufficient pareto optimality conditions are obtained by converting a multiobjective fractional variational problem into a single or a family of single fractional variational problems with an auxiliary scalar functional , possibly depending on some parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] presents some preliminaries on fractional calculus , essentially to fix notations . in section  [ main:1 ]",
    "we introduce the fractional derivative @xmath0 and provide the necessary concepts and results needed in the sequel .",
    "our main results are stated and proved in section  [ ssec : pro ] and section  [ main:2 ] .",
    "the fractional variational problems under our consideration are formulated in terms of the fractional derivative @xmath0 .",
