    "a consequence of the presence of cold dark matter in galactic halos is the formation of caustics .",
    "caustics are regions of infinite density in the limit where the dark matter particles have zero velocity dispersion .",
    "the leading dark matter candidates , namely axions and weakly interacting massive particles(wimps ) , have very small primordial velocity dispersions ( @xmath0 cm / s for a 100 gev wimp , @xmath1 cm / s for a 10 @xmath2ev axion @xcite ) and may be expected to form caustics with large density enhancements .",
    "if the dark matter is made up of wimps , the particles can annihilate producing gamma rays",
    ". it may be possible to detect this gamma ray flux by means of future experiments such as glast @xcite .",
    "caustics may possibly be revealed by this technique .",
    "caustics form because cold dark matter particles occupy a thin , three dimensional hypersurface in phase space @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of caustics in galactic halos : outer and inner @xcite .",
    "the outer caustics are topological spheres surrounding galaxies .",
    "the inner caustics have a more complicated geometry which depends on the details of the dark matter angular momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "when the angular momentum distribution is dominated by a net rotational term , the inner caustics have the appearance of rings @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for caustic rings was found by analyzing the rotation curves of external galaxies @xcite and the rotation curve of the milky way @xcite . a triangular feature seen in the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) map of the milky way is also suggestive of the presence of a nearby inner caustic ring @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , possible evidence was found for a caustic ring in the galaxy cluster cl0024 + 1654 . in this article",
    ", we discuss dark matter annihilation in caustic spheres and caustic rings and present simulated gamma ray sky maps .    the existence of dark matter caustics is sometimes disputed on the basis of large scale cosmological simulations . however , current simulations use particles with mass of order @xmath3 .",
    "such massive particles have spurious collisions which destroy fine details in the dark matter phase space hypersurface .",
    "thus the absence of caustics in most large scale simulations is probably due to the finite resolution of these simulations and the large particle masses involved .",
    "note that discrete flows and caustics are observed in @xmath4-body simulations when special care is taken .",
    "the simulations of stiff and widrow @xcite , which increase the resolution in the relevant regions of phase space , do show discrete flows .",
    "more recently , vogelsberger et al . @xcite employed a new technique to study small scale structures such as caustics .",
    "further progress in numerical techniques may enable the study of caustic properties in galactic halos using @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "in cold dark matter cosmology , galactic halos form through a process of  hierarchical clustering \" .",
    "small halos form first .",
    "larger halos , such as that of the milky way , are the outcome of past mergers , the accretion of smaller halos of various sizes , and the accretion of unclustered dark matter .",
    "this general scenario must surely be correct without , however , telling us anything precise .",
    "the critical issue for the existence of a caustic is the velocity dispersion of the flow that would form it . to be specific ,",
    "consider the flow of dark matter that the milky way halo is accreting _",
    "today_. if the dark matter in this flow has not clustered on any small scales yet , its velocity dispersion has the primordial value mentioned earlier , of order 0.03 cm / s for a 100 gev wimp .",
    "if it has clustered already , its effective velocity dispersion is the velocity dispersion of the structure it has become part of . the largest structures for which we have evidence of recent accretion are small sattelites , such as the sagittarius dwarf , with velocity dispersion of order 10 km / s .",
    "so one may conservatively assume that the flow of wimp dark matter accreting onto the galaxy today has variable velocity dispersion between 0.03 cm / s and 10 km / s .",
    "dark matter caustics are generically surfaces on one side of which the density diverges , in the limit of zero velocity dispersion , as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance to the surface and @xmath7 is a constant called the  fold coefficient \" . for finite velocity dispersion @xmath8 , the dark matter caustics in a galactic halo",
    "are smoothed over a distance @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flow velocity ( of order 300 km / s ) and @xmath11 is the overall size of the halo ( of order 300 kpc ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion cuts off the divergence of the density at the caustic , i.e. the @xmath12 behaviour stops for @xmath13 . for the above range of velocity dispersion , @xmath14 ranges from @xmath15 cm to 10 kpc .",
    "since outer caustics have size of order hundreds of kpc , they are not erased by the expected velocity dispersion .",
    "inner caustics which have size of order 10 kpc are smoothed out only when the flow is entirely composed of sattelites with velocity dispersion of order 10 km / s .",
    "as was mentioned , evidence for caustic rings of dark matter in the milky way was found in the existence and distribution of sharp rises in the galactic rotation curve and the presence of a triangular feature in the iras map of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "this evidence implies an upper limit on the velocity dispersion of order 50 m / s , or an upper limit on the smoothing scale @xmath14 of order @xmath16 pc .",
    "the wimp annihilation rate per unit surface of caustic is proportional to the integral @xmath17 this equation shows that caustics enhance the annihilation signal only by a logarithmic factor @xcite which varies from @xmath18 to 20 , depending on the velocity dispersion .    in this article , we limit ourselves to the simple cases of a spherically symmetric outer caustic and an axially symmetric inner caustic ring .",
    "our symmetry assumptions are made solely for the purpose of computational ease . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we verified that caustics are stable under perturbations , in particular perturbations that break any assumed symmetry .",
    "moreover , the symmetry assumptions are consistent with the observational evidence mentioned earlier .",
    "previous work on the possibility of detecting dark matter caustics by indirect means include @xcite .",
    "caustics and cold flows are also relevant to wimp and axion direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "the number of photons received by a detector per unit area , per unit time , per unit solid angle and per unit energy due to wimp annihilation is given by the expression@xcite @xmath19 the term @xmath20 depends only on the particle physics : @xmath21 @xmath22 is the wimp annihilation cross section times the relative velocity averaged over the momentum distribution of the wimps , @xmath23 is the wimp mass , @xmath24 is the number of photons produced per annihilation per unit energy @xmath25 in the annihilation channel @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the branching fraction of channel @xmath26 .",
