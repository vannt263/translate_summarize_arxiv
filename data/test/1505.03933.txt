    "the study of collective flow in relativistic nuclear collisions has potential to offer insight into the equation of state of the produced matter . directed flow , @xmath2 , is the first harmonic coefficient of the fourier expansion of the final - state momentum - space azimuthal distribution @xcite , @xmath3        where the angle brackets indicate an average over all the particles and events used , @xmath4 denotes the azimuthal angle of the outgoing particles and @xmath5 is the orientation of the event plane which is determined event - by - event .",
    "both hydrodynamic  @xcite and nuclear transport models  @xcite indicate that directed flow is a promising observable for investigating a possible phase transition , especially in the region of beam energy scan ( bes ) program at rhic . in particular",
    ", the shape of @xmath2 as a function of rapidity , @xmath6 , in the mid - rapidity region is of interest because it has been argued that it is sensitive to crucial details of the expansion of the participant matter during the early stages of the collision .",
    "the models indicate that the evolving shape and orientation of the participant zone and its surface play a role in determining the azimuthal anisotropy measured among these particles in the final state  @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath7 candidates are indicated by dashed - line boxes . ]",
    "it is generally believed that the directed flow is generated early in the heavy - ion collision",
    ". therefore it may be an important probe to provide valuable information of the onset of bulk collective dynamics during thermalization , even on the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "recently star published the measurement of directed flow of identified hadrons ( protons , antiprotons , and positive and negative pions ) with high precision for semi - central au+au collisions in the energy range @xmath8 gev  @xcite .",
    "after the publication of these data , there have been some theoretical efforts @xcite to understand the underlying physics and this is an ongoing effort .",
    "still sizable discrepancies with experimental measurements in the directed flow characteristics are found for the microscopic kinetic models at @xmath9 20 gev and are common for the transport models hsd , phsd and urqmd .",

    "the slopes for protons , antiprotons and net - protons are reported  @xcite . ]",
    "the role of transported baryon number and absorption effects are not well understood .",
    "there are still a lot to be done , specially in the model calculation since the effect of event plane used in the experiment does not exactly coincide with the known reaction plane in the theory calculation .",
    "the role of produced particle vs spectator in the event plane calculation may change with energy since the event plane detector is in fixed phase space .",
    "urqmd simulation suggests that these effects will have a minimal effect in the experimental results .",
    "we report here the directed flow @xmath0 measurements for charged kaons in au+au collisions from the star experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in the range @xmath10 7.7 to 200 gev , based on data from star experiment collected during rhic run in the years 2010 and 2011 .",
    "these measurements are presented as a function of rapidity and centrality .",

    "data reported in these proceedings were collected in au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 7.7- 200 gev in the year 2010 and 2011 with a minimum bias trigger .",
    "the main detector used in the present measurements is the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , the primary tracking device at star , time of flight detector and beam beam counter .",
    "tpc has full azimuthal coverage and uniform acceptance in @xmath11 units of pseudorapidity .",
    "the charged particle momenta are measured by reconstructing their trajectories through the tpc .",
    "the centrality was determined by the number of tracks from the pseudorapidity region @xmath12 .",
    "the beam beam counter ( bbc ) detector subsystem  @xcite consists of two detectors mounted around the beam pipe , each located outside the star magnet pole - tip at opposite ends of the detector approximately 375 cm from the center of the nominal ir as shown in fig 1 .",
    "each bbc detector consists of nearly circular scintillator tiles arranged in four concentric rings that provide full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the two inner rings have a pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath13 and are used to reconstruct the first - order event plane for this analysis .",
    "charged kaons were identified up to 1.6 gev/@xmath14 in transverse momentum based on specific energy loss in the tpc and from the time measurement by star s time - of - flight barrel in combination with the momentum .",
    "possible systematic uncertainties arising from non - flow , i.e. , azimuthal correlations not related to the reaction plane orientation ( arising from resonances , jets , strings , quantum statistics , and final - state interactions like coulomb effects ) are reduced due to the relatively large pseudorapidity gap between the star tpc and the bbc detectors  @xcite . directed flow measurements based on the bbc event plane , where the bbc east and west detectors ensure symmetry in rapidity acceptance , cancel biases from conservation of momentum in the basic correlation measurement because the difference in @xmath2 between the rapidity hemispheres is used .",
    "however , momentum conservation effects do contribute to systematic uncertainty in the event - plane resolution , and thereby in the resolution - corrected signal , at the level of less than 2%  @xcite .",
