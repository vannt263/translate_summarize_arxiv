    "many attempts to deduce the nature of radio - loud agn have depended heavily on observations of 178 mhz selected 3c sources ( e.g. longair 1999 ) .",
    "studies of a revised 3c ( 3crr ) sample ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) have yielded valuable information on the nature and evolution of the population of steep - spectrum radio sources . however",
    "the tight correlation between radio luminosity and redshift in any single flux - limited sample such as 3crr make distinguishing between trends with luminosity and redshift impossible .",
    "most other completely identified samples have been selected at high - frequencies ( e.g. the 2.7 ghz 2 jy sample of wall & peacock 1985 ) .",
    "high - frequency selected samples contain different types of radio sources , such as a high fraction of flat - spectrum quasars which have their jet axes close to our line - of - sight .",
    "it is therefore difficult to compare the properties of the low - frequency 3crr sample with one selected at a much higher frequency .",
    "the first low - frequency selected sample fainter than 3crr and completely identified was the 6ce sample ( eales 1985 ; rawlings , eales & lacy 2001 ) .",
    "this sample contains every radio source in 0.1 sr of sky with 151 mhz flux - density @xmath4 jy .",
    "hence it contains sources with luminosities approximately a factor of 6 lower than the 3crr sample at any redshift .",
    "one example of the power of investigating a range in radio luminosity at a given redshift is the study which revealed that the @xmath5-band magnitudes of 6ce radio galaxies are systematically fainter than those in the 3crr sample at @xmath6 ( eales et al .",
    "1997 ) , indicating a relationship between the host galaxy luminosity and radio luminosity in high - redshift radio galaxies ( roche , eales & rawlings 1998 ) .",
    "however , the fact that the 6ce sample is only a factor of 6 fainter than 3crr means that neither a large range in luminosity at a particular redshift , nor a range in redshift at a constant luminosity is achieved with the combination of the 3crr and 6ce samples .",
    "studies such as deriving the luminosity function of radio sources are therefore difficult with this small flux - density range .",
    "what is required is another completely identified low - frequency sample with a flux - density limit fainter than the 6ce sample . to this end",
    "we have undertaken to obtain identifications and redshifts for radio sources from three regions of the 7c catalogue  the 7c redshift survey . in this paper",
    "we present spectroscopic data on the radio galaxies in the 7c  i and 7c  ii regions ; data on all the quasars and broad - lined radio galaxies ( blrgs ) has been presented in willott et al .",
    "data on the 7c  iii region have been published in lacy et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , lacy , bunker & ridgway ( 2000 ) and references therein .    using the 7crs we have shown that the correlation between narrow emission line and radio luminosities in radio galaxies and quasars ( rawlings et al .",
    "1989 ; baum & heckman 1989 ) is real and not due to correlations of these properties with redshift ( willott et al .",
    "the 7crs has also shown that the relative numbers of quasars and radio galaxies is a strong function of both radio and narrow line luminosity , with very few quasars at low luminosities ( willott et al .",
    "correlations between radio luminosity , redshift , linear size and spectral index in the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs samples were investigated with radio source evolution models to show that all high redshift radio sources in these samples are observed a relatively short time after the jet - triggering event ( blundell , rawlings & willott 1999 ) .",
    "a new derivation of the radio luminosity function using these samples has been presented by willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in this paper",
    "we briefly discuss the selection of the sample ( section 2  a full description will be given in blundell et al . in prep . ) and present optical spectroscopy of radio galaxies in the 7c  i and 7c  ii regions ( section 3 ) . in section 4 we give notes on individual sources . in section 5",
    "we discuss the sample redshift distribution and the stellar populations in the low - redshift ( @xmath7 ) radio galaxies .",
    "the seven sources without redshifts from optical spectroscopy ( most of which have very red optical to near - ir colours ) are discussed in willott , rawlings & blundell ( 2001 ; hereafter wrb ) .",
    "the seventh cambridge ( 7c ) survey was carried out with the cambridge low frequency synthesis telescope ( clfst ; see mcgilchrist et al .",
    "1990 for details of the telescope ) at a frequency of 151 mhz .",
    "the regions 7c  i and 7c  ii overlap with fields 5c6 and 5c7 , respectively , of the 5c survey ( pearson & kus 1978 ) .",
    "an early attempt to identify these sources was made by rossitter ( 1987 ) , but he was largely unsuccessful due to the optical faintness of many of the sources .",
    "these fields are centred on @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( epoch b1950.0 ) , respectively .",
    "the fields lie approximately @xmath10 either side of the galactic plane , so there are few problems of foreground obscuration and reddening of the optical emission from the radio sources .",
    "the completeness limit of the 7c survey in these fields is 0.12 jy for 7c  i and 0.18 jy for 7c  ii ( blundell et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the 7c redshift survey ( 7crs ) contains every source within these regions with @xmath11 jy for 7c  i , @xmath12 jy for 7c  ii and @xmath13 jy for 7c  iii .",
    "the slight difference between these limits is due to a re - evaluation of the flux - density scales after much of the follow - up observations had been made .",
    "the 7c  i region covers 0.0061 sr of sky and contains 37 objects , the 7c  ii region covers 0.0069 sr and contains 39 objects .",
    "one source ( 3c 200 ) is common to both the 3crr sample and the 7crs .",
    "the resolution of the clfst observations of the 7c fields is 70 @xmath14 70 cosec(dec ) arcsec@xmath15 . in order to determine the structures of the sources ,",
    "high - resolution observations were made with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "full details of the radio observations will be given in blundell et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "all members of the 7crs ( except the flat - spectrum quasar 5c7.230 and 3c200 ) have been imaged at @xmath5-band to provide an identification for spectroscopy and to determine the near - ir morphology and magnitude .",
    "details of these observations and images are given in willott et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where we discuss the @xmath16 relation and its dependence upon radio luminosity .",
    "magnitudes for quasars and broad - lined radio galaxies were also given in willott et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for almost all cases",
    "a secure @xmath5-band identification has been found . in cases where imaging gave more than one possible counterpart , long - slit spectroscopy usually revealed the location of the true radio source identification",
    "( see section [ notes ] ) .    to fix the astrometry of the @xmath5-band images ,",
    "finding charts from either the apm catalogue ( irwin et al . 1994 ) , or the hst guide star catalogue , were obtained for each radio source field . for most fields , one or more stars detected on the @xmath5-band images were also on the finding charts . for cases where three or more stars appear on both the image and the chart ,",
    "the iraf gasp package was used to determine the plate solution for the image . for cases where only one or two finding chart stars were detected on the @xmath5-band image , the plate solution for another image with a good fit on the same observing run",
    "was used along with the position of one of the detected stars . in a few cases ,",
    "no finding chart stars were within the image fields , but for these objects wider field @xmath17-band images were available and the astrometry could be achieved by first determining the positions of fainter objects on the @xmath17-band images .",
    "the vla maps resolved the radio sources typically into core and lobe components .",
    "where a core is clearly identifiable , it is usual to find the optical counterpart within an arcsecond of this position ( consistent with the residual error expected from the astrometric process ) .",
    "where no core is visible , the counterparts are generally found between the two lobes , often approximately equidistant between the two .",
    "where several objects were close to the expected counterpart position , the radio and @xmath5-band images were overlaid .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy of candidates revealed the true identification because of the strong emission lines present in most agn ."
