    "distributed along the galactic disc , open clusters are members of the thin - disc component of the milky way galaxy . since the stars in an open cluster are almost at the same metallicity , distance and age , but from different spectral classes , these systems provide valuable data to study the galactic structure , chemical composition , stellar structure and star formation processes @xcite .",
    "thus , the structural and astrophysical parameters of open clusters such as the reddening , metallicity , distance and age have to be determined through precise photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "furthermore , the stellar structure and evolution models exhibit considerable discrepancies at different parts of the observational main - sequence due to adoption of different input physics @xcite .",
    "since open clusters allow for direct comparisons of the predictions of theoretical models with observations , they provide very important tools to better understand the physical reasons behind some of these discrepancies .",
    "the most common method used to infer the astrophysical parameters of the galactic and extra - galactic open clusters is based on fitting stellar isochrones to the observed colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and two - colour diagrams ( tcds ) of the clusters . in this method ,",
    "astrophysical parameters are estimated simultaneously via bayesian statistics .",
    "however , such simultaneous statistical solutions based on comparison of stellar isochrones with the photometric observations suffer from degeneracies between parameters , causing large uncertainties in the measured reddening , metallicity @xcite , and therefore the age values .",
    "different approaches were suggested to break the age - reddening degeneracy in the simultaneous solutions .",
    "the main idea behind most of these suggestions is to use the maximum available wavelength range , preferably including at least one near - infrared ( nir ) band ( cf .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that , if nir data can not be obtained and only observations in four passbands are available , one of the best photometric band combination for a reliable parameter determination is @xmath9 .",
    "besides these suggestions , independent ( traditional ) and reliable methods that were developed for the determination of the reddening and metallicity , such as those recently used by @xcite , can be used to constrain these parameters .    here , we focus on the ccd _ ubvri _ observations of open cluster ngc  6866 ( @xmath10 ) since it is one of the clusters located in the kepler field @xcite and atmospheric model parameters and radial velocities for a considerable number of stars in the cluster s field are present in the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "the availability of photometric and spectroscopic data allow us to calculate the cluster s precise astrophysical and kinematical parameters .",
    "following independent methods we find reddening and metallicity of the cluster from the stars with high membership probabilities and then keeping these two constant , we derive its distance modulus and age by fitting stellar isochrones to the observed cmds .",
    "although it has recently been investigated photometrically , ngc  6866 is a relatively less well - known cluster @xcite as compared to the other open clusters located in the kepler field ( ngc  6811 , ngc  6819 and ngc  6791 ) . the colour excesses , distance moduli , distances and ages obtained for ngc  6866 in the previous studies are summarized in table 1 .",
    "almost all of these studies have assumed a solar metallicity for the cluster . @xcite",
    "measured the radial velocities of two giant stars located in the cluster field and estimated a mean radial velocity of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite derived a radial velocity of @xmath13 @xmath14 0.75 km s@xmath12 , a value in agreement with the mean velocity given by @xcite .",
    "they also found the proper motion components as @xmath15 and @xmath16 mas yr@xmath12 for ngc  6866 .",
    "@xcite detected 19 variable stars in the cluster field , changing @xmath17 apparent magnitudes from 12.1 to 17.4 and @xmath3 colours from 0.3 to 2.2 mag .",
    "@xcite found 28 periodic variables with @xmath17 apparent magnitudes between 11.5 and 19.3 and @xmath3 colours between 0.3 and 2.1 mag .",
    "nineteen of these systems were newly identified .",
    ".colour excesses ( @xmath18 ) , distance moduli ( @xmath19 ) , distances ( @xmath20 ) and ages ( @xmath21 ) collected from the literature for the open cluster ngc  6866 .",
    "references are given in the last column . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]          in order to estimate the parameters of the galactic orbit of the cluster , we followed the procedure described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first performed a test - particle integration in a milky way potential which consists of a logarithmic halo , a miyamoto - nagai potential to represent the galactic disc and a hernquist potential to model the bulge .",
    "we then used values from @xcite for lsr corrections .",
    "we calculated galactic orbits of the six cluster stars with a membership probability larger than 50% for which lamost data are given in table 6 .",
    "median values of the radial velocity and proper motion components of these stars , and the mean distance of the cluster were taken as the input parameters for the cluster s galactic orbit estimation : @xmath22 km s@xmath12 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 mas yr@xmath12 , and @xmath25 pc , respectively .",
    "the proper motion components were taken from @xcite , while the radial velocities of the cluster stars and their distances were found in this study .",
    "proper motions used in our study are almost the same as used by @xcite ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 mas yr@xmath12 ) who also calculated the parameters of the galactic orbit of the cluster .",
    "galactic orbits of the stars were determined within an integration time of 3 gyr in steps of 2 myr .",
    "this integration time corresponds to minimum 12 revolutions around the galactic center so that the averaged orbital parameters can be determined reliably . in order to determine the galactic orbit of the cluster ,",
    "means of the orbital parameters found for the stars were adopted as the orbital parameters of the cluster .    in fig .",
    "14 , representations of galactic orbits calculated for the cluster stars and the cluster itself are shown in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 planes . here ,",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are heliocentric galactic coordinates directed towards the galactic centre , galactic rotation and the north galactic pole , respectively .",
    "the cluster s apogalactic ( @xmath33 ) and perigalactic ( @xmath34 ) distances were obtained as 9.78 and 7.76 kpc , respectively . the maximum vertical distance from the galactic plane",
    "is calculated as @xmath35 . when determining the eccentricity projected on to the galactic plane , the following formula was used : @xmath36 .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit was calculated as @xmath7 .",
    "this value shows that the cluster is orbiting the galaxy with a period of @xmath37 myr as expected for the objects in the solar neighborhood .",

    "the cluster s mean orbit is indicated with a blue line .",
    "the black plus , red circle and green triangle symbols in panel ( a ) represent the galactic centre , and current locations of the sun and ngc 6866 , respectively . ]",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) is defined as the relative number of stars in the unit absolute magnitude range .",
    "since the correction for the non - member stars in a cluster field is very important in the estimation of the luminosity function , we decided to demonstrate the effect of non - member stars using the following procedure .",
    "first , we selected the main - sequence stars with @xmath38 mag located in a circular field of 6 arcmin radius from the centre of the cluster .",
    "note that the stars fainter than @xmath39 mag have no accurate astrometric data in the ucac4 catalogue @xcite .",
    "thus , the membership probabilities can not be estimated for the stars fainter than @xmath39 mag .",
    "then we removed the stars located out of the band - like region presented in fig .",
    "10 . additionally , we also selected the stars located near the turn - off point of the cluster and brighter than @xmath40 mag .",
    "this selection procedure resulted in 116 stars with the membership probability @xmath41 .",
    "for the main - sequence stars , the apparent magnitude @xmath38 corresponds to a mass range of @xmath42 for the cluster . in order to demonstrate the effect of non - member field stars , the lfs of the cluster estimated for the stars with the membership probabilities of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) are displayed in fig .",
    "the lfs of ngc  6866 in fig .",
    "15 indicate that the lf of the cluster has a maximum value towards @xmath47 mag .",
    "the mass function ( mf ) denotes the relative number of stars in a unit range of mass centered on mass @xmath48 .",
    "it represents the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass .",
    "theoretical models provided by the parsec synthetic stellar library @xcite were used to convert the lfs to mfs for ngc  6866 .",
    "resulting mfs are presented in fig .",
    "the slope @xmath49 of mass function can be derived by using the following linear relation : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 represents the number of stars in a mass bin @xmath52 with central mass of @xmath48 , and @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "the slopes of the mfs are found to be @xmath54 and @xmath8 for the stars with the membership probabilities of @xmath43 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "since these values are in agreement in errors , we conclude that the effect of non - member stars can be negligible .",
    "as the stars with the membership probability @xmath45 constitute a more pure sample for the cluster stars , we adopt the mf slope @xmath8 for ngc  6866 .",
    "this mf slope is in a perfect agreement with the value of 1.35 given by @xcite for the stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "( a ) and @xmath45 ( b ) . ]",
    "the reddening , metallicity , distance modulus and age of a cluster can be simultaneously determined by fitting the theoretical stellar evolutionary isochrones to the observed cmds .",
    "however , astrophysical parameters derived from the simultaneous solutions suffer from the reddening - age degeneracy ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , independent methods developed for the determination of the astrophysical parameters are very useful to reduce the number of free parameters . in this study , using such methods , the reddening was inferred from the @xmath2 vs @xmath3 tcd of the cluster and found as @xmath55 mag and the metallicities estimated from the spectroscopic and photometric observations were found to be roughly in agreement and assumed to be the solar value .",
    "hence , keeping these two parameters as constants , we derived the distance modula and age of ngc  6866 by fitting its observed cmds to the theoretical isochrones as @xmath4 mag and @xmath56 myr , respectively . with this method",
    ", we attempt to break in part the reddening - age degeneracy .",
    "although the same metallicity values were adopted in the determination of the astrophysical parameters of ngc  6866 , a comparison of tables 1 and 7 reveals that the reddening , the distance modula , and the distance in this study were found to be smaller than those reported in the previous studies .",
    "the determined age of the cluster is in agreement with @xcite and @xcite . since our photometric data is in good agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that the main reason for the disagreement of the results can be due to the chosen isochrone and age determination difference . it would be confident to conclude that our results are reliable since a more comprehensive approach which tries to minimize degeneracies among parameters is used in this study .",
    "there is only one star with @xmath57 in the rc region of the cmds of the cluster .",
    "the apparent magnitude and the colour index for this star are @xmath58 and @xmath59 mag , respectively .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 ( see section 4.1 ) and @xmath60 mag @xcite as the intrinsic colour excess and absolute magnitude of this rc star , respectively",
    ". using the pogson s relation , the distance of the rc star of the cluster is calculated as @xmath61 pc , in agreement with the mean distance given in table 7 , @xmath62 pc .",
    "using the most likely members of the cluster for which the radial velocities are taken from the lamost database , we estimated the galactic orbit of ngc  6866 .",
    "the eccentricity projected on to the galactic plane for its orbit is calculated to be @xmath7 , which implies that the cluster is located in the thin - disc component of the galaxy .",
    "galactic orbital parameters of the cluster were also calculated by @xcite using the mean radial velocity given in @xcite .",
    "they calculated the eccentricity of the orbit of the cluster to be @xmath63 and the maximum vertical distance from the galactic plane @xmath64 .",
    "a comparison shows that the eccentricity found in our study is about 50% larger than that calculated in @xcite probably since @xmath65 value in this study is about 30% smaller than their ones .",
    "the luminosity function of ngc  6866 has a maximum value near @xmath47 mag .",
    "the derived slope of the mass function for the cluster is @xmath8 which is in a good agreement with the value of 1.35 given by @xcite for the stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
