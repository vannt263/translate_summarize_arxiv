    "embedded solitons are solitary - wave solutions of nonlinear evolution equations which reside at discrete points inside the continuous spectrum of the linear wave system .",
    "the existence of such waves has been known in various physical systems such as the fifth - order korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equations @xcite , extended nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite , coupled kdv equations @xcite , second - harmonic - generation ( shg ) system @xcite , massive thirring model @xcite , three - wave system @xcite , and many others @xcite . in @xcite , such waves were given the name `` embedded solitons '' , and their distinct semi - stability property was revealed on heuristic ground .",
    "this semi - stability means that when a perturbation increases a certain positive - definite quantity ( energy or momentum ) associated with the embedded soliton , then the perturbed state approaches asymptotically the embedded soliton .",
    "however , when the perturbation decreases energy ( momentum ) of the embedded soliton , the perturbed state decays into radiation .",
    "the semi - stability property was later proved rigorously for embedded solitons in the perturbed integrable fifth - order kdv equation @xcite and in the generalized shg system @xcite .",
    "the method in @xcite follows the soliton perturbation technique and describes embedded solitons as critical points of a first - order dynamical system .",
    "both location and stability of critical points can be studied within the reduced system .",
    "the other paper @xcite develops the normal form analysis which relies on the known existence and linearized stability properties of embedded solitons .",
    "it proves the nonlinear semi - stability of embedded solitons through wave resonance mechanisms .",
    "the latter method does not rely on the integrability of the original system , and it can be extended to any embedded - soliton - bearing system under certain assumptions .",
    "nonlinear semistability of embedded solitons is an interesting phenomenon because it occurs beyond the linear stability .",
    "the linear stability of solitary waves in the fifth - order kdv equation was studied by using the energy - momentum methods @xcite and the symplectic evans matrix methods @xcite .",
    "a solitary wave is linearly unstable if the linearization operator possesses an eigenvalue with a positive real part .",
    "if all eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis , the wave is called neutrally stable",
    ". a neutrally stable wave can however still be unstable due to algebraic instabilities @xcite . for embedded solitons",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "single - hump embedded solitons are generally neutrally stable in the linearized problem .",
    "however , a discrete zero eigenvalue of the linearization operator is embedded inside the continuous spectrum of this operator .",
    "because of this , a nonlinear resonance between the embedded zero eigenvalue and the continuous spectrum can tunnel energy of a perturbed embedded soliton into continuous - wave radiation . the energy loss does not always destroy the embedded soliton though . if the perturbation increases the energy ( momentum ) of the embedded soliton , then the radiation becomes weaker and weaker as the perturbed state asymptotically approaches the embedded soliton .",
    "but if the perturbation decreases the energy ( momentum ) of the embedded soliton , the radiation becomes stronger and stronger , and the embedded soliton is then destroyed .",
    "thus , the semi - stability of embedded solitons is an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon beyond linear stability .",
    "besides single - humped embedded soliton in the fifth - order kdv equation , multi - humped embedded solitons may also exist @xcite .",
    "however , they are typically linearly unstable @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear semi - stability may occur in the system only if the linear instability is suppressed .",
    "thus , it makes sense to consider here only neutrally stable single - humped embedded solitons .",
    "we emphasize that semi - stability is not the same as instability . by controlling the energy ( momentum ) of the initial perturbation",
    ", we can induce either asymptotic persistence of the embedded soliton or its rapid disappearance .",
    "this is an ideal mechanism for switching ( quantization ) applications .    in this article , we study the evolution of perturbed neutrally stable embedded solitons in a general hamiltonian fifth - order kdv equation .",
    "we use the normal form analysis developed in @xcite but simplify many statements and proofs .",
    "we show that when an embedded soliton in the fifth - order kdv equation is perturbed , it sheds the continuous - wave radiation in front of the soliton .",
    "the radiation amplitude is not minimal in general .",
    "we also derive the velocity equation for the perturbed state which proves the semi - stability property of embedded solitons . in addition , we determine what initial condition leads to soliton decay , and what initial condition leads to soliton persistence .",
    "numerical simulations of the fifth - order kdv equation show excellent agreement with the analytical predictions .",

    "the embedded soliton , if it exists , arises from a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite , when the stable - unstable manifolds ( real roots ) correspond to the exponential tails of the embedded soliton , while the center manifold ( imaginary roots ) correspond to the tails of the continuous - wave radiation whose amplitude vanishes",
