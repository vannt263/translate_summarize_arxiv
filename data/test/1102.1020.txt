    "compact binary ( neutron star - neutron star , ns@xmath1 , or black hole - neutron star , bh - ns ) mergers are prime sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "the gw detectors ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite and geo600 @xcite are designed to optimally detect merger signals .",
    "these detectors have been operational intermittently during the last few years reaching their nominal design sensitivity @xcite with detection horizons of a few dozen mpc for ns@xmath1 and almost a hundred mpc for bh - ns mergers ( the ligo - virgo collaboration adopts an optimal canonical distance of 33/70mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "both ligo and virgo are being upgraded now and by the end of 2015 are expected to be operational at sensitivities @xmath2 times greater than the initial ligo @xcite , reaching a few hundred mpc detection horizon for ns@xmath1 mergers and a gpc for bh - ns mergers ( 445/927 mpc are adopted by the ligo - virgo collaboration as canonical values ; @xcite ) .    understanding the observable em signature of compact binary mergers has several observational implications . first ,",
    "once the detectors are operational it is likely that the first detection of a gw signal will be around or even below threshold .",
    "detection of an accompanying em signal will confirm the discovery , thereby increasing significantly the sensitivity of gw detectors @xcite .",
    "second , the physics that can be learned from observations of a merger event through different glasses is much greater than what we can learn through em or gw observations alone .",
    "finally , even before the detectors are operational , detection of em signature will enable us to determine the expected rates , a question of outmost importance for the design and the operation policy of the advanced detectors .",
    "the current constraints on the rates are rather loose . the last ligo and virgo runs provided only weak upper limits on the merger rates : 8700 myr@xmath3(@xmath4 corresponding to @xmath5 yr@xmath3 gpc@xmath6 for ns@xmath1 and @xmath7 myr@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ( @xmath8 ) for bh - ns @xcite .",
    "estimates based on the observed binary pulsars in the galaxy are highly uncertain , with values ranging from @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) arise from neutron star merger events .",
    "the estimated rate of short grbs are indeed comparable to binary pulsar estimates @xcite . however , while appealing , the association is not proven yet @xcite .",
    "if correct , the observed rate of short grbs , @xmath10 , provides a lower limit to the merger rate .",
    "the true rate depends on a poorly constraint beaming angle , resulting in an uncertainty of almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "there are no direct estimates of bh - ns mergers , as no such system has ever been observed , and here one has to relay only on a rather model dependent population synthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "possible em signals from coalescence events were discussed by several authors .",
    "there are several suggestions @xcite of a prompt ( coinciding with the gw signal ) short lived em signals , mostly in low radio frequencies , whose amplitudes are highly uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggested that the radioactive decay of ejected debris from the merger will drive a short lived supernova like event .",
    "@xcite calculated the radioactive heating during this process self - consistently .",
    "they find that if @xmath11 is ejected then the optical emission from a merger at @xmath12 mpc peaks after @xmath13 day at @xmath14 .",
    "if the mass ejection is lower then the optical emission will be even fainter .",
    "finding , and especially identifying the origin of , such rare and faint events in the crowded variable optical sky is an extremely challenging task , even for current and future optical searches like ptf @xcite , panstarr , and lsst @xcite .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that mergers produce short grbs @xcite .",
    "however , short grbs are expected to be beamed , and only rarely this em signal will point towards us . a beamed grb that is observed off - axis will inevitably produce a long lasting radio  orphan \" afterglow @xcite . a key point in estimating",
    "the detectability of grb orphan afterglows is that the well constrained observables are the _ isotropic _ equivalent energy of the flow and the rate of bursts that point towards earth .",
    "however , the detectability of the orphan afterglows depends only on the _ total _ energy and _ true _ rate , namely on the poorly constraint jet beaming angle . @xcite",
    "have shown that while large beaming increases the true rate it reduces the total energy , and altogether reduces the detectability of radio orphan afterglows .",
    "this counterintuitive result makes the detectability of late emission from a decelerating jet , which produced a grb when it was still ultra - relativistic , less promising .",
    "however , regardless of amount of ulrtra - relativistic outflow that is launched by compact binary mergers , and of whether they produce short grbs or not , mergers are most likely do launch an energetic sub - relativistic and mildly - relativistic outflows .",
    "the interaction of these outflows with the surrounding matter will inevitably produce blast waves and possibly stronger radio counterparts than that of ultra - relativistic outflows .",
    "below we first discuss ( in  2 ) the current estimates of mass and energy ejection from compact binary mergers . in ",
    "3 we calculate the radio emission resulting from the interaction of this ejecta ( sub - relativistic , mildly relativistic and off - axis relativistic ) with the surrounding interstellar matter ( ism ) .",
    "the calculations follow to a large extent models of radio ib / c supernovae @xcite and long grb radio afterglows @xcite .",
    "the success of radio supernova ( sn ) modeling , where the observations are superb , indicates that the microphysics is well constrained ant that equipartition parameters describe well the physical conditions .",
    "hence the main uncertainty in the predicted radio signal is in the amount of matter ejected from the merger event and its velocity .",
    "luckily the estimates of this important quantity can be significantly improved even using existing numerical models .",
    "we discuss the observational implications for detectability of merger remnants in  4 .",
    "we estimate the expected rates of detection of different outflows in  4.1 .",
    "we devote in  4.2 a special attention to short grb orphan afterglows that are a special case of our model , in which the outflow is launched relativistically , but the radio emission peaks only during its mildly relativistic phase .",
    "the estimates of orphan afterglows detectability is independent of whether they are the products of binary mergers or not . in ",
    "4.3 we examine possible other radio transients that may hinder the identification of merger remnants .",
    "finally in  4.4 we examine blind transient searched done in the past and we identify rt 19870422 as a possible and even likely merger remnant .",
    "we conclude in  5 .",
    "numerical simulations of compact binary mergers have been carried out by various groups with two different approaches .",
    "some ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use newtonian dynamics ( modified to allow for gravitational radiation back - reaction ) with detailed microphysics .",
    "others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use full general relativistic dynamics with different levels of approximate microphysics , with or without mhd . in almost all ns@xmath1 simulations",
    "one finds an accretion disk surrounding a rapidly rotating massive object that eventually collapses to a black hole .",
    "an exception is the recent general relativistic simulations of @xcite who find no disks in some configurations .",
    "the system lifetime is at least a few dozen milliseconds and possibly longer .",
    "the fate of an accretion disk in a bh - ns merger is expected to depend on the mass ratio , the bh spin and the ns compactness . in some cases",
    "the disk is very small while in others it is substantial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all simulations find some form of relativistic or sub - relativistic mass ejection .",
    "first , matter is ejected as tidal tails during the first stages of the merger . in bh - ns mergers",
    "the ejected energy can be very high and its velocity is mildly relativistic .",
    "for example @xcite find @xmath15 c ejecta with @xmath16 erg , where c is the light speed . in a ns@xmath1 mergers a lower , but yet significant",
    ", amount of energy can be ejected ( e.g. , @xcite find @xmath17 erg ) at a lower velocities of @xmath18 c. this mass ejection is expected also if no significant disk is formed .",
    "disk formation leads to several additional outflow sources .",
    "first , neutrino heating drives a wind from the disk surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energy in this wind is substantial with predictions ranging between @xmath19 erg and @xmath20 erg for 0.01 - 0.1 m@xmath21 disk .",
    "the outflow velocity is @xmath22 c from the outskirts of the disk and it is increasing , possibly up to relativistic velocities , for wind that is ejected from close to the central object . the mass ejection becomes even stronger when neutrino heating shuts - off and the wind is driven by viscous heating and by he - synthesis @xcite , leading to an ejection of @xmath23 of the initial disk mass at @xmath18 c. additional energy source is neutrino - antinuetrino annihilation above the disk , which can deposit up to @xmath24 erg , into an amount of mass that is not well constrained , leading possibly to a relativistic outflow .",
    "finally , more speculative , but yet very plausible , source of outflow are em processes that tap the rotational energy of the central object , such as the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "these are likely to produce relativistic outflows with an energy that can be as high as @xmath25 erg , and are the most probable engines of short grbs , if those are produced by compact binary mergers .",
    "the conclusion is that a significant mass and energy ejection is a prediction of almost all compact binary merger modelings . in ns@xmath1 mergers",
    "an ejection of @xmath26 erg at @xmath18 c is a fairly robust prediction .",
    "faster ejecta ( relativistic or mildly relativistic ) with energy @xmath27 is also quite likely from inner parts of the 0.01 - 0.1 m@xmath21 disk that is typically found in simulations .",
    "the outflow from bh - ns mergers was explored only by a few authors , but it is also seems to be significant and potentially even more energetic and at faster velocities than the outflow from ns@xmath1 mergers .",
    "consider a spherical outflow with an energy @xmath28 and an initial lorentz factor @xmath29 , with a corresponding velocity @xmath30 , that propagates into a constant density , @xmath31 , medium .",
    "if the outflow is not ultra relativistic , i.e. , @xmath32 it propagates at a constant velocity until , at @xmath33 , it reaches radius @xmath34 , where it collects a comparable mass to its own : @xmath35 and @xmath36 where we approximate @xmath37 and ignore relativistic effects . here and in the following , unless stated otherwise",
    ", @xmath38 denotes the value of @xmath39 in c.g.s . units . at a radius @xmath40",
    "the flow decelerates assuming the sedov - taylor self - similar solution , so the outflow velocity can be approximated as : @xmath41    if the outflow is collimated , highly relativistic and points away from a generic observer , as will typically happen if the mergers produce short grbs , the emission during the relativistic phase will be suppressed by relativistic beaming .",
    "observable emission is produced only once the external shock decelerates to mildly relativistic velocities and the blast - wave becomes quasi spherical .",
    "this takes place when @xmath42 namely at @xmath43 . from this radius",
    "the hydrodynamics and the radiation become comparable to that of a spherical outflow with an initial lorentz factor @xmath44 .",
    "this behavior is the source of the late radio grb orphan afterglows @xcite .",
    "our calculations are therefore applicable for the detectability of mildly and non - relativistic outflows as well as for radio orphan grb afterglows .",
    "emission from newtonian and mildly relativistic shocks is observed in radio sne and late phases of grb afterglows .",
    "these observations are well explained by a theoretical model involving synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons in an amplified magnetic field .",
    "the success of this model in explaining the detailed observations of radio ib / c sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to employ the same microphysics here .",
    "energy considerations show that both the electrons and the magnetic field carry significant fractions of the total internal energy of the shocked gas , @xmath45 .",
    "these values are consistent with those inferred from late radio afterglows of long grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed spectra indicate that the distribution of the accelerated electrons lorentz factor , @xmath46 , is a power - law @xmath47 at @xmath48 where @xmath49 in mildly relativistic shocks ( e.g. , the radio emission from grb associated sne and late grb afterglows ) and @xmath50 in newtonian shocks ( as seen in typical radio sne ; ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) . the value of @xmath51 is not observed directly but it can be calculated based on the total energy of the accelerated electrons , @xmath52    the radio spectrum generated by the shock is determined by two characteristic frequencies .",
    "one is @xmath53 the typical synchrotron frequency of electrons with the typical ( also minimal ) lorentz factor @xmath51 .",
    "the other is @xmath54 , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency .",
    "we show below that since we are interested at the maximal flux at a given observed frequency , @xmath54 may play a role only if it is larger than @xmath55 .",
    "its value in that case is @xmath56    , and frequencies , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the arrows show the temporal evolution of the characteristic values .",
    "the temporal dependence before @xmath33 is noted below / to the left of the arrows while the temporal dependence after @xmath33 is noted above / to the right of the arrows .",
    "note that the evolution of @xmath55 and @xmath57 , marked only in the left spectrum , is relevant for both spectra .",
    "the evolution of @xmath54 , marked only in the right spectrum , is correct only when @xmath58 and is therefore relevant only in that spectrum.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    figure [ fig : spec ] illustrates the two possible spectra , depending on the order of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the flux at any frequency can be found using these spectra and the unabsorbed synchrotron flux at @xmath55 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the distance to the source ( we neglect any cosmological effects ) .",
    "note that this is the real flux at @xmath55 only if @xmath61 ( see figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "as long as the shock is moving with a constant velocity i.e. , at @xmath62 , the flux across the whole spectrum increases ( see equations [ eq num]-[eq fm ] ) .",
    "the flux evolution at later times depends on the spectrum at @xmath33 , namely on @xmath63 and if @xmath64 then possibly on @xmath65 the flux at that time can be found using the unabsorbed synchrotron flux at @xmath66 : @xmath67    consider now a given observed frequency @xmath68 .",
    "we are interested at the light curve near the peak flux at this frequency .",
    "there are three possible types of light curves near the peak corresponding to : ( i ) @xmath69 , ( ii ) @xmath70 and ( iii ) @xmath71 . where we define @xmath72 as the frequency at which this equality will never take place . in that case",
    "@xmath73 is the frequency at which this equality would have happened if @xmath29 would have been large enough ( see figure [ fig : cases ] ) ] @xmath74 . in figure",
    "[ fig : cases ] we show a schematic sketch of the time evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the corresponding ranges of @xmath68 in which each of the cases is observed .     and @xmath55 in two cases , @xmath75 ( top ) and @xmath64 ( bottom ) . also marked is the value of @xmath73 .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks @xmath76 .",
    "the ranges of @xmath68 at which each of the cases is observed is separated by horizontal dashed lines and marked on the right .",
    "note that in the bottom panel @xmath55 and @xmath54 are not crossing each other at @xmath77 and only two types of light curves , cases ( i ) and ( iii ) , can be observed.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    to estimate the time and value of the peak flux we recall , that at all frequencies the flux increases until @xmath33 . in case ( i ) ,",
    "@xmath69 , the deceleration time , @xmath76 , is also the time of the peak .",
    "the reason is that while @xmath57 increases , @xmath55 decreases fast enough so that @xmath78 decreases after @xmath33 .",
    "note that in that case @xmath54 plays no role since it decreases after deceleration .",
    "overall , in this case the flux peaks at @xmath33 and @xmath79 .",
    "in the two other cases , ( ii ) and ( iii ) , @xmath80 and/or @xmath81 and the flux keeps rising at @xmath77 until @xmath82 or @xmath83 , whichever comes last . to find out which one of the two frequencies",
    "is it , we compare @xmath68 with @xmath73 . at @xmath84 , @xmath55 decreases faster than @xmath54 .",
    "therefore in case ( ii ) where @xmath85 , the last frequency to cross @xmath68 is @xmath55 and the peak flux is observed when @xmath86 . in case ( iii )",
    "where @xmath87 , and the last frequency to cross @xmath68 is @xmath54 and the peak flux is observed when @xmath88 .",
    "now , it is straight forward to calculate the peak flux , @xmath89 and the time that it is observed , @xmath90 , for different frequencies .",
    "it is also straight forward to calculate the flux temporal evolution prior and after @xmath33 using equations [ eq num]-[eq fm ] and the relation @xmath91 which holds at @xmath62 and @xmath92 at @xmath84 .",
    "the peak fluxes , the times of the peak and the temporal evolution of the three different cases are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the overall different light curves are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ]        .[table1 ] the observed flux before and after @xmath90 in the three different regimes . @xmath93 the temporal evolution only during the last power - law segment before @xmath90 . at earlier times",
    "the temporal evolution may be different . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the most sensitive radio facilities are at frequencies of @xmath94 ghz and higher .",
    "equations [ eq numdec ] and [ eq nuadec ] imply that in this frequency range , for most realistic scenarios , it is a case ( i ) light curve , i.e. , @xmath95 . therefore , a newtonian and mildly relativistic outflows as well as relativistic grb orphan afterglows peak at @xmath33 with : @xmath96    the regime of @xmath97 at lower radio frequencies ( @xmath98 ghz ) depends on the various parameters . if the outflow is newtonian or the density is low or the energy is low then @xmath99 mhz and equation [ eq fpeak reg1 ] is applicable .",
    "otherwise low radio frequencies are in regime ( iii ) , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "the flux peaks in this case at @xmath101 with @xmath102 in the last two equations we used @xmath103 ( other @xmath104 values in the range 2.1 - 3 yield slightly different numerical factors and power laws ) .    to date , the best observed signal from a mildly relativistic blast waves is the radio emission that follows grb associated sne .",
    "the main difference is that in these cases the circum burst medium is typically a wind ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) and therefore the density at early times is much larger then in the ism and self absorption plays the main role in determining the light curve .",
    "a good example for comparison of equation [ eq fpeak reg1 ] with observations is the light curve of sn 1998bw .",
    "this light curve is observed at several frequencies at many epochs , enabling a detailed modeling that results in tight constraints of the blast wave and microphysical parameters .",
    "@xcite find that at the time of the peak at @xmath94 ghz , about 40 days after the sn , taking @xmath106 , the energy in the blast wave is @xmath107 erg , its lorentz factor is @xmath108 and the external density at the shock radius is @xmath109 .",
    "the peak is observed when @xmath110 and it depends only on these parameters ( it is only weakly sensitive to the density profile ) . therefore , equation [ eq fpeak reg1 ] is applicable in that case .",
    "indeed , plugging these numbers into equation [ eq fpeak reg1 ] we obtain a flux of 20 mjy at the distance of sn 1998bw ( 40 mpc ) , compared to the observed flux of 30 mjy .",
    "this is not surprising given that the model we use is based on that of radio sne .",
    "in the discussion above we considered an outflow with a characteristic energy and velocity . however a compact binary merger may produce an outflow with an energy dependent velocity , e.g. , @xmath111 . if we consider a case ( i ) signal ( @xmath69 ; e.g. , above @xmath112 ghz ) then we find @xmath113 .",
    "therefore if @xmath114 the flux is dominated by the mildly relativistic ejecta , assuming that the relativistic part of the outflow is not pointing towards the observer .",
    "otherwise the flux is dominated by the slowest ejecta .",
    "for canonical parameters the strongest signal is expected around @xmath94 ghz , conveniently where the sensitivity of radio telescopes is high . if the signal peaks at lower frequencies it decreases from the peak as @xmath115 . since 1.4 ghz receivers are ten times more sensitive than lower frequency ones they are still more likely to detect a signal even in this case .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 ghz is the optimal frequency to look for radio remnants of compact binary mergers and we therefore consider here the delectability at a @xmath94 ghz survey .",
    "the number of events in a single whole sky snapshot is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the detectable volume at the survey flux limit @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the time that the flux is above the detection limit and @xmath120 is the event rate .",
    "since at @xmath94 ghz the relevant light curve is case ( i ) ( see  [ sec theory ] ) we use equations [ eq : tdec ] and [ eq fpeak reg1 ] , and the approximation @xmath121 , to find that the number of radio coalescence remnants in a single @xmath94 ghz whole sky snapshot is @xmath122 where @xmath123 mjy and @xmath124 is the merger rate in units of @xmath125 .",
    "since the microphysical parameters are reasonably constrained by radio sne , the main uncertainty in the signal detectability is the blast - wave properties and the circum - merger density .",
    "the latter is expected to vary significantly between different merger events , dropping down to @xmath126 for mergers that take place outside of their host galaxies .",
    "however , the observed galactic double - ns population reveals that a significant fraction of compact binary mergers ( at least ns@xmath1 ) take place in the disks of milky - way - like galaxies where @xmath127 .    as discussed in",
    " 2 there is a good chance that ns@xmath1 mergers eject mildly relativistic outflows with @xmath128 erg . in that case the em counterparts of these gw sources are detectable by current facilities . a deep radio survey that covers a significant fraction of the sky will most likely detect their radio remnants to a distance of @xmath129 mpc .",
    "these will appear as transients , varying on a several weeks time scale , with an optically thin spectrum at @xmath130 ghz at all time .",
    "the radio remnants will be identified in random places within their host galaxies , which should be easily detectable at that distance .",
    "it will not be accompanied by any optical counterpart with similar variability time scales . given a gw trigger with localization of @xmath131 , a deep search of the error box will detect a remnant in cases that the surrounding density is not very low .",
    "ns@xmath1 mergers are also expected to eject energetic , @xmath132 erg , outflow at lower velocities , @xmath133 .",
    "the detectability is very sensitive to the velocity , @xmath134 for @xmath103 , and to the energy , @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , even if there is no mildly relativistic component to the outflow , the number of detectable remnants that are dominated by slow moving ejecta is expected to be significant .",
    "for example , assuming that an energy of @xmath136 erg is ejected at @xmath137 we expect @xmath138 .",
    "the variability time scale of these transients is expected to be @xmath139 yr .",
    "if the velocity is instead @xmath140c the number of events drops by an order of magnitude and the variability timescale increases to @xmath141 yr .",
    "these time scales increase the difficulty in the identification of the remnants as transients , and require a long term survey",
    ". the spectrum of these transients will be optically thin also at low frequencies ( @xmath142 mhz ) .",
    "other characteristics of these transients ( e.g. , location within the host ) are expected to be similar to that of a mildly relativistic outflow .",
    "a gw triggered search increases of course the probability to find a remnant and a @xmath143 erg outflow can be detected up to @xmath12 mpc even if its velocity is @xmath144c .",
    "the detectability of bh - ns mergers is much harder to predict .",
    "first due to their virtually unconstrained rate and second since the properties of the outflow are less certain .",
    "the latter can be significantly improved by current and future merger simulations that put focus on the ejected mass . in any case",
    "the potential of these mergers to throw out a considerable amount of energy , @xmath17 erg , at mildly relativistic velocities can make them detectable to their gw detection horizon , which is much further than the ns@xmath1 horizon .    finally , if compact binary mergers launch also collimated ultra - relativistic outflows , and produce short grb , then orphan short grb afterglows are also part of the post merger em signal .",
    "the detectability of radio orphan afterglows can be estimated based on observations of short grbs and is independent of whether they are produced by mergers or not .",
    "we discuss their detectability in the next subsection .",
    "all together , the range of the current predictions is rather large , but with most parameters we expect detectable radio signals .",
    "some of the new generation radio telescopes have large fields of view ( e.g. , askap with @xmath145 and apertif with @xmath146 ; @xcite ) and improved sensitivities , making them ideal for large scale sub - mjy blind survey .",
    "the evla , which has a smaller field of view but a remarkable sensitivity , is the best facility for gw triggered search .",
    "it is also currently the fastest radio - survey instrument and it can carry - out a sub - mjy blind survey .",
    "all these observatories have a very good chance to detect compact binary merger remnants in dedicated blind searches .",
    "in fact with very reasonable parameters ( e.g. , @xmath147 erg of mildly relativistic ejecta ) a sub - mjy whole sky survey can detect thousands of binary - merger radio remnants .",
    "short grb outflow begins highly relativistic and probably highly beamed .",
    "eventually it slows down ( see  [ sec theory ] ) and become detectable from all directions .",
    "therefore , the rate estimate equation [ eq rate ] is also applicable for radio orphan afterglows when @xmath148 .",
    "however some of the parameters in equation [ eq rate ] are not directly observable .",
    "the observed quantities are isotropic equivalent @xmath46-ray energy , @xmath149 , and the rate of bursts that point to the observer @xmath150 , while equation [ eq rate ] depends on @xmath151 and @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the fraction of the @xmath154 steradian covered by the jet and @xmath155 is the isotropic equivalent energy in the afterglow blast wave .",
    "x - ray observations indicate that @xmath46-ray emission in short grbs is very efficient and that in general @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "we assume that this is the case in the following discussion .",
    "@xmath149 of short grbs ranges at least over four orders of magnitude ( @xmath157 erg ) .",
    "the rate of observed short grbs is dominated by @xmath19 erg bursts , and the luminosity function can be well approximated by a power - law , at least in the range @xmath158 erg , such that @xmath159 where @xmath160 @xcite . plugging these into equation [ eq rate ] we obtain @xmath161",
    "this equation is similar to equation 9 of @xcite , with the observed luminosity function already folded in .",
    "narrower beamed bursts ( with lower @xmath162 ) are more numerous and they produce less total energy per burst .",
    "the positive dependence of equation [ eq orphan_rate ] on @xmath162 implies that overall the lower energy is  winning \" over the increased rate , and the detectability of narrower bursts is lower .",
    "using , equation [ eq orphan_rate ] we can put a robust upper - limit on the orphans rate since all the parameters are rather well constraint by observations , with the exception of @xmath162 which is @xmath163 by definition .",
    "therefore , assuming that short grbs are beamed , the detection of the common @xmath24 erg bursts in a blind survey , even with next generation radio facilities , is unlikely @xcite .",
    "however , brighter events should be detectable .",
    "if the beaming is energy independent , detectability increases with the burst energy .",
    "the luminosity function possibly breaks around @xmath20 erg , in which case the orphans number is dominated by @xmath20 erg bursts . for @xmath164 we expect , from these bursts @xmath141 orphan afterglows at a 0.1 mjy in a single @xmath94 ghz whole sky snapshot .",
    "so far we discussed detectability in a blind survey .",
    "a followup dedicated search would be , of course , more sensitive .",
    "if compact binary mergers produce short grbs than the energy of most gw detected bursts will be faint with @xmath165 erg .",
    "the chance to detect their orphan afterglows again depended on their total energy and thus on @xmath162 .",
    "equation [ eq fpeak reg1 ] shows that if @xmath164 then detection should be difficult but possible in a dedicated search mode . note",
    "that since the energy of the burst is low , the radio emission will evolve quickly , reaching a peak and decaying on a week time scale , so a prompt and rather deep search will be needed .",
    "@xcite carried out a 5 ghz survey looking for transients on timescales of a week to a year .",
    "the survey sensitivity for transients with variability scale @xmath166 day is 0.37 mjy with an effective are of @xmath167 .",
    "events with variability time scale of two months where surveyed at sensitivity of 0.2 mjy with an effective area of @xmath168 .",
    "@xcite report the detection of 10 transients .",
    "the most interesting of those , in our context , is rt 19870422 , which has a variability time scale of two months .",
    "it is found within a star forming galaxy at a distance of 1.05 gpc , but at a significant offset from the host nucleus .",
    "its luminosity and time scale are those expected from a @xmath169 erg mildly relativistic outflow that propagates in the ism .",
    "it is , therefore , a prime candidate for a compact binary merger radio remnant .",
    "based on this single event @xcite infer a best estimate rate of @xmath170 for rt 19870422-like events .",
    "taking a @xmath171 poisson error , the best estimate translates to a range of @xmath172 , fully consistent with the estimates of compact binary mergers .",
    "if this is indeed a merger remnant then , since for optically thin spectrum the fluxes at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz are not very different , a sub - mjy 1.4 ghz whole sky survey would detect hundreds to thousands of radio remnants .",
    "@xcite suggested that this transient is a radio sne similar to sn 1998bw , but brighter .",
    "this is certainly a viable possibility , however , if true then this radio sn is brighter by an order of magnitude than the brightest radio sn ever observed before .",
    "unfortunately , lacking optical search for a sn or a multi - wavelength measurement that determines the transient spectrum , it is impossible to rule out any of the two possibilities .    an additional interesting candidate is rt 19840613 .",
    "it is variable on less than 7 days and it has a host galaxy at a distance of 140 mpc . even assuming a variability time scale of 7 days it is marginal as a merger remnant candidate . assuming 7 days variability @xcite find a rate of @xmath173 , which is again only marginally consistent with current estimates of compact binary merger rates .",
    "therefore , while this may be a merger remnant it is not a very promising candidate .",
    "@xcite suggest that this is also a sn 1998bw - like event . while this possibility can not be ruled out , the inferred rate is at least an order of magnitude larger than that of 98bw - like events ( note that radio sne as bright as sn 1998bw are very rare compared to typical radio sne ) .",
    "the additional 8 events detected by @xcite have no clear host galaxies and are therefore probably not merger remnants .",
    "a key issue with the detection of compact binary merger remnants in blind surveys is their identification . @xcite",
    "present a census of the transient radio sky .",
    "luckily the transient radio sky at @xmath94 ghz are relatively quite .",
    "the main contamination source are radio active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , however their persistent emission is typically detectable in other wavelength and/or deeper radio observations .",
    "moreover , the signal from a compact binary merger is expected to be located within its host galaxy ( otherwise the density is too low ) , but away from its center .",
    "the host and the burst location within it , should be easily detectable at the relevant distances .",
    "the only known , and guaranteed , transient 1.4 ghz source with similar properties are radio sne . among these typical radio sne",
    "are the most abundant .",
    "transient search over 1/17 of the sky with @xmath174 mjy at 1.4ghz @xcite finds one radio sn .",
    "this rate translates to @xmath175 sne in a whole sky @xmath176 mjy survey .",
    "these contaminators can be filtered in three ways .",
    "first , by detection of the sn optical light",
    ". however , the optical signal may be missed if it is heavily extincted , and given the large number of radio sne , misidentifying even a small fraction of them may render the survey useless for our purpose .",
    "the second filter is the optically thick spectrum at high radio frequency ( @xmath141 ghz ) at early times , which is a result of the blast wave propagation in a wind .",
    "thus , a multi - wavelength radio survey can identify radio sne .",
    "the last filter is the luminosity - time scale relation of typical radio sne that is induced by the outflow velocity ( e.g. , figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "type ii sn outflows are slow , @xmath177c , and therefore their radio emission is longer / fainter than that expected for merger remnants . the common type of ib / c radio sne is produced by @xmath178c blast waves but with much less energy than what we expect from a binary merger outflow , and therefore their radio emission is much fainter",
    ". the combination of any two of these filters will hopefully be enough to identify all the typical radio sne .",
    "slightly different contaminators are grb associated sne .",
    "their outflows is as fast and as energetic as those that we expect from a binary merger and therefore their radio signature is similar in time scales and luminosities .",
    "sn1998bw - like events are detectable by a 0.1 mjy survey at 1.4 ghz up to a distance of several hundred mpc for 40 days and their rate is @xmath179 @xcite , implying at least several sources at any whole sky snapshot . here",
    "only the first filter ( sn optical ligth ) and possibly the second ( optically thick spectrum ) can be applied .",
    "however , given the high optical luminosity of grb associated sne and their relatively low number this should be enough in order to filter them out .",
    "these contaminators highlight the importance of a multi - wave length strategy where an optical survey accompany the radio survey to best utilize both surveys detections .",
    "the results of @xcite implies that thousands of sources with properties similar to rt 19870422 are expected in a 5 ghz sub - mjy all sky survey",
    ". if these events are optically thick during their whole evolution than these are not merger remnants and they could be easily filtered out . moreover , in that case their rate in a 1.4 ghz survey should be lower by two orders of magnitude .",
    "if these events show a synchrotron optically thin spectrum and no optical counterparts , then they should be abundant also in a 1.4 ghz survey , and their origin is most likely compact binary mergers .    finally , radio is the place to look for blast waves in tenuous mediums , regardless of their origin .",
    "any source of such explosion , being a binary merger , a grb or a sn , produces a radio signature .",
    "therefore , all the strong explosions may be detectable is a deep radio survey , this include for example long grb on - axis and off - axis afterglows and giant flares from extra galactic soft gamma - repeaters .",
    "the difference between the radio signatures of the different sources ( amplitude , spectrum and time evolution ) depends on the blast wave energy and velocity and on the external medium properties .",
    "we thus will be able to identify the characteristics of binary mergers outflows . if , however , there is a different source of @xmath169 erg of mildly relativistic outflow that explodes in the ism it will be indistinguishable from binary mergers ( at least not in the radio ) .",
    "currently we are not aware of any such source , with the exception of long grbs at the low end of the luminosity function , but these are too rare to contaminate a survey .",
    "any other source of such outflows , if exist , will probably be a part of the family of collapsing / coalesing compact objects .",
    "compact binaries are expected to eject sub - relativistic , mildly relativistic and possibly ultra - relativistic outflows as part of their merger process .",
    "we have shown that these outflows will inevitably produce a long lived radio remnant .",
    "these are the most robust predictions of an em counterpart of the merger gw signal .",
    "the radio remnant appears weeks to years after the merger and remains bright for a similar time .",
    "therefore , a trigger following a detection of gw signal can wait for a week after the event and no online triggering is needed . in addition",
    "the long lasting remnants enable a detection in a blind survey .",
    "for mildly relativistic outflows with @xmath19 erg that propagate in the ism we expect a few weeks radio transients with a 1.4 ghz flux of @xmath180 0.3 mjy from sources at @xmath129 mpc , the advanced ligo - virgo horizon for ns@xmath1 mergers .",
    "the bh - ns gw horizon is farther , but current numerical simulations suggest they involve higher energy outflow resulting in a comparable flux .",
    "follow up observations of gw candidate events , at a level of @xmath181jy are feasible and are very likely to show a radio transient for either ns@xmath1 merger of bh - ns merger .",
    "we find that the optimal frequency to carry out a search for merger remnants is @xmath94 ghz .",
    "assuming a mildly relativistic outflow with @xmath19 erg the canonical ns@xmath1 merger rate of 300 gpc@xmath6 yr@xmath3(and a range of 20 - @xmath182 gpc@xmath6 yr@xmath3 ) implies a detection of @xmath183 ( 1 - 1200 correspondingly ) radio ns@xmath1 remnants in a @xmath140 mjy all sky survey .",
    "this rate depends quadratically on the outflow energy , so a very plausible ejected energy of @xmath136 erg increases the rate by two orders of magnitude , making them detectable even in a survey that covers only a small fraction of the sky or that is at a mjy sensitivity .",
    "therefore carrying out a large field - of - view and sensitive ghz survey by currently available facilities has a great potential to constrain the rate of binary mergers , a piece of information that is of great importance for the design and operation of gw detectors .",
    "even if mergers do not launch a significant mildly relativistic ejecta they are still expected to produce an energetic ( @xmath184 erg ) sub - relativistic ( 0.1 - 0.2)c outflows .",
    "these outflows will also produce radio remnants .",
    "these remnants will be fainter , detectable only to a distance of @xmath142 mpc at 0.1 mjy , and will evolve more slowly , on time scales of 3 - 10 yr .",
    "these transients are also detectable at a rate of @xmath141 over the whole sky at 0.1 mjy , although identifying them as transients is harder and it requires a long term survey .",
    "we estimate the detectability of short grb orphan afterglows , which may also be produced by compact binary mergers if they are launching also ultra - relativistic outflows .",
    "these estimates are based on short grb observations and are therefore indifferent to whether short grbs are binary mergers or not .",
    "the main uncertainty in the rate estimates is the grb beaming factor .",
    "we find that assuming @xmath164 there are expected to be about 10 orphan afterglows at a 0.1 mjy in a single @xmath94 ghz whole sky snapshot .",
    "the duration of these afterglows is several weeks",
    ". if binary mergers are short grbs than a gw triggered event will most likely be of a low energy grb , @xmath165 erg , and a true energy , after beaming correction , that is even lower .",
    "the radio orphan afterglow will probably still be detectable in a deep search .",
    "however its variability time scale is short , about a week , so the search should be done promptly .",
    "remarkably , the observed 5 ghz transient rt 19870422 , detected by @xcite fits very well our estimates of the typical expected properties of a compact binary merger radio remnant . at a distance of 1 gpc and a duration of two months",
    "this transient is what expected from a mildly relativistic outflow with @xmath169 erg .",
    "the rate inferred from this single event is also fully consistent with that of ns@xmath1 mergers .",
    "this transient is an excellent candidate to be the first observed radio remnant of a merger .",
    "unfortunately , one can not rule out the possibility , suggested by @xcite , that this is an especially bright radio sn .",
    "note , however , that this interpretation requires a sn brighter by an order of magnitude than any radio sne previously observed .",
    "simultaneous optical observations or multi - wavelength radio observations could have easily distinguished between the two possibilities .",
    "the first could have determined if there was a sn or not .",
    "the second could have distinguished between an optically thick radio spectrum expected in radio sne vs the optically thin spectrum expected in merger remnants at these frequencies at all times .",
    "unfortunately , no such observations were available .",
    "however , the rate implied by this even is very high and similar events should be detected in a sub - mjy survey of even a small fraction of the sky .",
    "therefore , the nature of this type of events can be easily probed with current facilities .",
    "our results show the great potential of @xmath94 ghz radio transient observations at the sub - mjy level for the detection of ns@xmath1 mergers . on the observational side",
    "these predictions provide an excellent motivation for carrying out a whole sky sub - mjy survey using the evla or other upcoming radio telescopes .",
    "the main source of contamination in such surveys would be radio supernova and those could be distinguished from compact binary mergers by their optical signal , spectrum and other characteristic properties .    while it is clear that compact binary mergers produce sub - relativistic to relativistic outflows , details of those outflows are not well determined at present .",
    "this is to large extent because of lack of interest rather than because of specific difficulties in analyzing their properties .",
    "our analysis elucidate the importance of a detailed quantitative estimates concerning these outflows , a task that is within the scope of current simulations .",
