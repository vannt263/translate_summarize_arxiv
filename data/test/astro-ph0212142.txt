    "compact radio sources in nearby starburst galaxies often appear to be supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "snr in our galaxy and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) are sources of bright near - infrared [ feii ] line emission with luminosities ranging from @xmath5w to @xmath6w ( for the [ feii]@xmath0 m line , e.g. , oliva , moorwood , & danziger 1989 ; burton & spyromilio 1993 ) .",
    "this behavior suggests a connection between supernova activity and the [ feii ] emission in starbursts .",
    "this is supported by near - infrared spectroscopy ( moorwood & oliva 1988 ; greenhouse et al .",
    "1991 ; vanzi & rieke 1997 ) , by high - resolution [ feii ] imaging studies ( forbes et al .",
    "1993 ; greenhouse et al . 1997 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2000 ) , and by the tight correlation between the radio 6 cm and the [ feii ] emissions ( forbes & ward 1993 ) .",
    "further determination of the relation of the infrared [ feii ] emission with the supernova activity in nearby starforming galaxies would be helpful both for the understanding of these galaxies and for using the near - infrared [ feii ] luminosity as estimator of the supernova rate in more distant galaxies where individual radio supernovae can not be identified .",
    "there are indications of some complexities in this relation .",
    "for example , the bright [ feii ] emission may not be spatially coincident with the radio snr .",
    "lumsden & puxley ( 1995 ) conducted a spectroscopic survey for [ feii ] emission from radio snrs in m33 and found that in some cases the [ feii ] emission does not peak at the position of the radio snr , as well as that some radio snr show no [ feii ] emission . recently ,",
    "morel , doyon , & st - louis ( 2002 ) have carried out an [ feii ] imaging survey of optically selected snr in m33 and found a similar result .",
    "both works have concluded that the [ feii ] emission from snr may be produced over a time scale of @xmath7 10@xmath8 years .",
    "greenhouse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that none of the brightest sources of [ feii ] emission in m82 were coincident with the position of the radio snrs .",
    "m82 and ngc  253 are the nearest starburst galaxies ( distances @xmath9mpc and @xmath10mpc respectively ) .",
    "both galaxies show a large number of radio compact sources ( e.g. , @xmath11 in m82 kronberg et al .",
    "1985 and huang et al . 1994 ; @xmath12 in ngc  253 turner & ho 1985 and ulvestad & antonucci 1991 , 1997 and references therein ) .",

    "( 1997 ) presented a fabry - perot [ feii]@xmath0 m map for m82 with a spatial resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "their main conclusions were that the compact [ feii ] sources contribute only @xmath14 of the total [ feii ] emission in m82 and that they trace a population of snr older than the radio snr .",
    "their work is somewhat inconclusive because of the limited angular resolution and also because strong extinction could hide [ feii ] emission from some of the radio snrs .",

    "the high spatial resolution of the nicmos [ feii]@xmath0 m images ( @xmath15 ; this corresponds to 5pc and 4pc for m82 and ngc  253 , respectively ) allows a detailed study of the location of the bright sources of [ feii ] and of the rle of supernova remnants in this line emission .",

    "a master dark image was produced by combining between 10 and 20 darks for a given sample sequence after the subtraction of the first readout .",
    "the darks used were part of other proposals observed close in time , and the flatfield images were on - orbit data .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the following steps : subtraction of the first readout , dark current subtraction on a readout basis , correction for linearity and cosmic ray rejection ( using fullfit ) , and flatfielding .",
    "the individual dithered galaxy images were registered to a common position using fractional pixel offsets and cubic spline interpolation , and combined to produce the final image of each field .",
    "prior to the flux calibration of the images , the background needs to be subtracted ( only for wavelengths longwards of @xmath24 m ) . due to the large projected size of both galaxies ,",
    "the field of view of the nic2 images is not large enough to enable measurements of the background on empty corners of the images , so we used background measurements taken during the servicing mission observatory verification ( smov ) program for the filter nic2 f222 m .",
    "the f215n images cover a larger field of view , and an estimate of the thermal background was obtained from the corners of the images .",
    "the flux calibration of the broad - band , on - line and off - line images was performed using the conversion factors ( from adu / s to mjy ) based on measurements of the standard star p330-e during smov ( marcia rieke 1999 private communication ) .    ideally one would like to measure the continuum on both sides of the emission line to estimate the continuum at the emission line .",
    "however , nicmos only provides continuum bands to the red of the emission line . in cases of objects such as m82 and ngc  253 , where the extinction to the nuclear regions is very high ( even at infrared wavelengths ) , a straight subtraction of the longer wavelength off - line image may result in an over correction of the continuum at the wavelength of the emission line . to estimate the continuum for the nic3 f164n images , we fitted the continuum on a pixel - by - pixel basis between @xmath25 m and @xmath26 m by linear regression of the flux as a function of the wavelength for the nic3 f166n and nic3 f215n line - free images .",
    "the extrapolated continuum was then subtracted from the nic3 f164n image to produce the final continuum - subtracted [ feii]@xmath0 m line image .",
    "this procedure does not correct for extinction , but it rather ensures the subtraction of the correct _ obscured _ continuum at each position of the galaxy . for the nic2 f187n image ( pa@xmath1 ) ,",
    "since we did not have other narrow - band images taken with camera 2 , we used the nic2 f190n continuum image .",
    "fortunately , the continuum need not be subtracted as accurately for pa@xmath1 as for the [ feii ] emission line because the pa@xmath1 emission is much brighter .",
    "the fully - reduced images of each individual field were combined to produce the mosaics .",
    "the images presented in this paper were taken during different orbits .",
    "this resulted in slightly different orientations ( from @xmath27 to @xmath28 for m82 and from @xmath29 to @xmath30 for ngc  253 ) . before combining the images into mosaics , they were rotated by linear interpolation to north up , east to the left .",
    "this provided the same orientation for all the images , and more importantly allows comparisons with previously published data .    to construct extinction maps to correct the [ feii ] emission , and [ feii]/pa@xmath1 maps ,",
    "the nic2 f187n , f190n , f160w and f222 m images were demagnified to match the plate scale of the nic3 images and filtered with a gaussian with @xmath31 to match the point spread function ( psf ) of the nic3 images .",
    "figure  1a and 1b are mosaics ( after rotation ) of the continuum at @xmath25 m and the continuum - subtracted [ feii]@xmath0 m line emission , respectively .",
    "both images are displayed on a logarithmic scale to stress the contrast between the diffuse extended continuum and the compact sources .",
    "the [ feii]@xmath0 m line map has been smoothed with a gaussian filter with @xmath32 .",
    "the line emission image shows some residuals which are due to both the under - sampling of the nic3 camera psf and the variation in the shape of the psf with wavelength .",
    "in addition , the right hand side of the line image shows a slightly lower s / n because the f164n and f166n images at that position had different orientations .",
    "the [ feii]@xmath0 m line emission exhibits two distinct components : a number of relatively compact regions distributed along the disk of the galaxy and an extended diffuse component in the form of filaments extending above and below the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the filaments seen in the [ feii]@xmath0 m emission line show a remarkable similarity with the chimneys at the base of the superwind detected in radio ( wills et al .",
    "1999 ) , which are interpreted by these authors as expelled material from the central region of m82 .    in figures  2a and 2b we present contour maps of the @xmath25 m continuum emission and the [ feii]@xmath0 m line emission , respectively . comparison of the nicmos [ feii]@xmath0 m line map with that of greenhouse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reveals that some of the sources seen in the lower resolution map of greenhouse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) break up into individual sources at higher spatial resolution .",
    "in particular , their source fe1 contains some 4 or 5 individual sources .",
    "source fe6 ( the most south - west source in greenhouse et al .",
    "1997 map ) appears as a point source at our resolution in both the nic3 f164n and nic3 f166n images , and the signal to noise on it is compromised by the differing image orientations ( see above ) .",
    "therefore it is not surprising we do not detect line emission from it .",
    "the nicmos images detect a number of compact sources in addition to those reported in greenhouse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",

    "the distribution of the radio snrs and their relation with the [ feii]@xmath0 m emission will be discussed in section  5 .    in figures  3a and 3b",

    "in fact , most of these sources seem to be slightly resolved , although due to the under - sampling of the nic3 psf , some uncertainties remain .",
    "the sources were selected to be easily distinguishable from the extended diffuse emission detected above and below the plane of the galaxy .",
    "in m82 we identified 65 `` compact '' sources in the [ feii]@xmath0 m map ( not corrected for extinction ) . for the radio sources in m82 we used the positions of snrs identified by searching for compact features within radio maps at 408mhz , 1.4ghz , 5ghz and 8.4ghz , with peak flux densities above 1mjy ( dr .",
    "karen wills , private communication 2000 ) .",
    "we excluded from this list radio sources that are classified as hii regions based on their radio spectral index ( see mcdonald et al .",
    "2002 for details ) , resulting in 44 radio snrs .",
    "we began the comparison of positions using the coordinates in the header of the nicmos nic3 f164n images and made small offsets of the [ feii ] image , cross - correlating the positions of the [ feii ] sources with the radio snrs .",
    "based on the resolution of the nic3 images and the average angular size of the radio snrs ( @xmath103 , huang et al .",
    "1994 ) , we counted a coincidence when the angular separation between a radio source and an [ feii ] source was @xmath104 . with a small shift , we found 21 coincidences between radio snrs and [ feii ] sources ,",
    "whereas if we used the original coordinates we could only find 7 coincidences .",
    "monte carlo simulations showed that the probability of finding 21 coincidences by pure chance is @xmath105 ( see whitmore & zhang 2002 for details on the method ) , so we believe that now the infrared and the radio images are properly aligned .",
    "for ngc  253 we found discrepancies between the coordinates derived for the near - infrared peak of emission from the nic2 and nic3 images ( which were taken during two different orbits ) .",
    "although no problems were reported for these two sets of observations , some error must be affecting the coordinates given in the headers of the images . again as with m82 , we cross - correlated the positions of the [ feii]@xmath0 m ( 36 sources ) and 35 radio sources taken from ulvestad & antonucci 1991 excluding those sources that are classified as hii regions in ulvestad & antonucci ( 1997) using the coordinates of the nic3 images .",
    "we find a total of 9 coincidences for a separation between the radio sources and [ feii ] sources @xmath106 .",
    "the probability of finding 9 coincidences in by pure chance in ngc  253 is approximately @xmath107 .",
    "one important conclusion , despite the uncertainties of the image alignment , is that we can not assign an [ feii ] source to each radio snr or vice versa .",
    "we find approximately @xmath3% of radio snrs in m82 and ngc  253 have an [ feii ] .",
    "this point is illustrated in the contour images of the [ feii]@xmath0 m line emission and continuum emission at @xmath25 m in figures  2a and 2b for m82 and figures  5a and 5b for ngc  253 . in all figures",
    "we show the positions of the radio snrs as asterisks .",
    "we also tried to determine if there is a relation between the presence of a coincidence and the age of the radio snr .",
    "such a correlation would be expected if the [ feii ] emission were brighter in older supernova remnants .",
    "for m82 we used the angular sizes of the radio snr as an indication of their age ( see huang et al .",
    "in general , we did not find that older radio snrs tend to have a coincidence with an [ feii ] source .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the [ feii ] sources identified in m82 image registered to match the field of view and position of the pa@xmath1 image , the number of detected sources ( 71 ) is slightly different from that in section  5.1 ] and ngc  253 using a fixed @xmath108 diameter aperture .",
    "this aperture corresponds to a physical size of 12pc and 10pc for m82 and ngc  253 , respectively .",
    "figures  9a and 9b show the distributions of the measured [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosities ( not corrected for extinction ) .",
    "some of the sources may be larger than the aperture used for the photometry ; on the other hand , patchy extinction will make some of the sources appear smaller . from inspection of typical source sizes , however , the luminosities would be accurate on average .",
    "recent studies of galactic snr show that the [ feii ] emission is filamentary and have sizes of the order of 11pc ( e.g , ic443 rho et al .",
    "2001 ; see also morel et al .",
    "2002 for snr in m33 ) .    for the assumed distances to m82 and ngc  253 the observed [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosities of these sources range from @xmath109w to @xmath110w .",
    "as a consistency check for the photometry , we measured the [ feii]@xmath0 m fluxes for the fe1 , fe2 and fe3 sources in m82 identified by greenhouse et al .",

    "however , when we compared our photometry for the sources reported in forbes et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for ngc  253 we found some discrepancies .    the corrected [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosities for compact sources in m82 and ngc  253 range from @xmath112w to @xmath113w . as a comparison ,",
    "galactic snrs yield [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosities of @xmath114w to @xmath115w ( oliva et al .",
    "1989 ; keller et al . 1995 ) , snrs in the lmc yield luminosities from @xmath116w to @xmath112w ( oliva et al . 1989 ) and snrs in m33 ( assuming a distance of 720kpc ) @xmath117 to @xmath112w ( lumsden & puxley 1995 and morel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the individual sources account for some 22% and 27% of the total [ feii]@xmath0 m emission ( extinction corrected ) measured in m82 and ngc  253 , respectively .",
    "given the estimates that the [ feii ] emitting phase of a snr has a duration of @xmath118yr ( lumsden & puxley 1995 ; morel et al .",
    "2002 ) and the supernova rates in m82 and ngc  253 are @xmath119yr@xmath16 ( huang et al . 1994 and ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ) , the detected [ feii ] sources account for @xmath120yr worth of supernovae .",
    "presumably much of the remaining unresolved [ feii ] arises from additional supernovae that are packed so densely that they are confused in our images .",
    "also , snrs in these two galaxies may expand and merge into a general hot ism within a few thousand years losing their identity as individual sources .",
    "photometry on the [ feii ] emission arising from the disk of m82 shows that as much as 70% of the total emission ( disk plus component perpendicular to the disk ) is associated with snrs .",
    "this together with the good agreement between the radio and [ feii ] morphologies of the components perpendicular to the disk gives further indication for a snr origin of the [ feii ] emission in starburst galaxies .",
    "lumsden & puxley ( 1995 ) pointed out that one possibility is that the [ feii ] lines reach maximum luminosity when the remnant as a whole undergoes the transition from adiabatic expansion to radiative expansion . according to shull & draine ( 1986 )",
    ", this happens when radiative cooling occurs faster than dynamical times , around @xmath121yr after the supernova explosion .",
    "therefore if the brightest [ feii ] emission occurs at approximately @xmath121yr , it is not surprising that we do not find a correspondence for all the [ feii ] sources and all the radio snrs .",
    "muxlow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that half of the radio sources in m82 are unresolved indicative of a young age , but the other resolved half are probably intermediate age .",
    "this together with the fact that we found that @xmath122 of the radio snr have an [ feii ] counterpart implies that the [ feii ] sources may be @xmath123yr .",
    "one possibility for the lack of one - to - one coincidences between the radio snrs and the [ feii ] sources would be that most of the [ feii ] emission in these two galaxies is produced in hii regions ( photoionization ) . to check this",
    ", we measured the pa@xmath1 fluxes for the sources detected in the [ feii ] extinction corrected map of m82 , and assumed an [ feii]@xmath0m / pa@xmath1 ratio for hii regions as that observed in orion .",
    "we found that only @xmath124 of the total [ feii]@xmath0 m arises from hii regions .",
    "this further supports the hypothesis that most of the [ feii]@xmath0 m emission along the plane of m82 is produced by snrs .",
    "the [ feii]/br@xmath43 ratios in hii regions and snr differ by a factor of a hundred or more , and therefore can be used to indicate the excitation mechanism of the [ feii ] line within our images . in alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we showed that the behavior of the [ feii]@xmath0m / br@xmath43 line ratio in starbursts and active galaxies can be understood as a progression from pure photoionization to pure shock excitation going from pure hii regions through starbursts , transition objects , seyferts to supernova remnants .    figures  8a and 8b are the observed [ feii]@xmath0m / pa@xmath1 maps for m82 and ngc  253 , respectively .",
    "the values of the [ feii]@xmath0m / pa@xmath1 ratio range from 0.02 in black ( mostly along the disk of the galaxy ) to 0.8 in white ( some of the bright [ feii ] sources ) .",
    "these ratios translate into [ feii]@xmath0m / br@xmath43 line ratios of between 0.24 and 10 ( see also the histograms in figure  10 ) .",
    "since these maps are not corrected for extinction , these numbers are actually lower limits . when the positions of radio sources are plotted in the [ feii]@xmath0m / pa@xmath1 maps we find again that there is a number of coincidences between the radio snrs and the regions of enhanced [ feii]@xmath0 m emission .",
    "this indicates that the relative contribution of the snrs is nearly as large in the diffuse background as it is in the radio snr .",
    "interestingly , we find that most of the coincidences with the radio snrs occur in regions of enhanced [ feii]@xmath0m / pa@xmath1 line ratio , or conversely we do not find a large number of coincidences in regions with high pa@xmath1 flux ( that is , hii regions ) .",
    "the supernova rate in m82 has been estimated from number counts of the radio supernova remnants and their ages to be @xmath125yr@xmath16 ( huang et al .",
    "the total [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosity in m82 is @xmath126([feii]@xmath127w .",
    "our value for the [ feii ] luminosity of m82 is approximately 1.5 and 2 times higher than the previous estimates by greenhouse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and vanzi & rieke ( 1997 ) , respectively .",
    "this difference is most likely due to better extinction estimates made possible by our nicmos images .",
    "if the supernova rate in m82 is @xmath128yr@xmath16 , then we can derive the following calibration for the supernova rate in terms of the [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosity :    @xmath129}}{10^{34 } { \\rm w}}\\,\\,\\ , ( { \\rm yr}^{-1})\\ ] ]    the total [ feii]@xmath0 m luminosity ( corrected for extinction ) measured in ngc  253 is @xmath130 .",

    "a rate of @xmath132 has been calculated assuming that the non - thermal radio flux is entirely due to synchrotron emission ( van buren & greenhouse 1994 ) ; this value is consistent with the similar number of compact radio sources in this galaxy compared with m82 .",

    "we assume that the ratio for a typical hii region is @xmath135([feii]@xmath0m@xmath136 ( e.g. , orion ) .",

    "we have presented _ hst_/nicmos observations of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc  253 .",
    "the morphology of the [ feii]@xmath0 m line emission in both galaxies displays two components : ( 1 ) a disk component with a number of superimposed compact sources and ( 2 ) a diffuse component in the form of filaments above and below the disk of the galaxy . in m82",
    "we find a remarkable similarity between the extended component , the fingers or chimneys above and below the disk , of the radio and [ feii ] emissions .    in m82 ,",
    "we have detected in both pa@xmath1 and [ feii ] a nuclear ring of star formation .",
    "this ring , with an approximate diameter of 400pc , has also been observed in other near- and mid - infrared hydrogen recombination lines and in the [ neii]@xmath34 m line .",
    "the peak of the @xmath35 m continuum brightness of m82 lies very close to ( within 1 ) the dynamical center , and corresponds to the center of the ring of star formation . in ngc  253 ,",

    "we have compared the number of ionizing photons infered from the extinction - corrected pa@xmath1 maps with other estimates based on longer wavelength indicators , and found a good agreement .    since the [ feii ]",
