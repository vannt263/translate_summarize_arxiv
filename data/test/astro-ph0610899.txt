    "the accurate localisation of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) through their optical and x - ray afterglows has enabled detailed studies of their environments .",
    "selection by the unobscured gamma - ray flash alone has allowed the discovery of a unique sample of galaxies which span an enormously wide range of redshifts from @xmath0 @xmath1 0.009 ( grb980425 , e.g. tinney et al .",
    "1998 ; galama et al .",
    "1998a ) to 6.3 ( grb050904 , kawai et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) . the subset of long - duration ( @xmath2 2 s ) grbs are almost certainly caused by the collapse of certain massive stars to black holes , confirmed by observations of supernova components in the late - time afterglows of a number of long - grbs ( woosley & bloom 2006 ; kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ) and by the observed location of grbs in uv - bright regions within their host galaxies ( bloom et al . 2002 ; fruchter et al .",
    "grbs are located in host galaxies which are generally small , faint , blue and highly star - forming ( e.g. chary et al .",
    "2002 ; fruchter et al . 1999 ; le floch et al .",
    "hence , detailed and extensive host galaxy observations provide a wealth of information on the gas and dust properties of star - forming galaxies throughout cosmological history .    accurately measuring the dust content of these galaxies is of great importance in , to name one example , the determination of their unobscured star formation rates where uncertainty in the correction for dust can easily dominate the errors on the measured star formation rates for high redshift galaxies ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "1998 ; meurer et al .",
    "absorption within our own galaxy along a particular line of sight can be estimated and removed , but absorption which is intrinsic to the grb host galaxy as a function of wavelength is unknown , and is especially difficult to determine given its dependence on metallicity and the possible existence of dusty intervening systems whose extinction curves can not be disentagled from those of the host galaxy .",
    "afterglow spectroscopy and/or photometry can be used to provide an estimate of the total extinction along the line - of - sight to the grb .",
    "if the host galaxy itself is bright and extended enough to be observed once the afterglow has faded , different lines - of - sight may be probed besides the off - centre uv - bright regions within which grbs are generally situated .",
    "extinction in the optical / uv regime due to dust grains is typically modelled using either milky way ( mw or galactic ) , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) or small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction curves ( e.g. pei 1992 ) because these curves can be measured and so are well known , or with the calzetti extinction law derived empirically from uv observations of starburst and blue compact galaxies ( calzetti et al .",
    "it appears that dust content in most grb hosts produces an smc - like extinction law ( e.g. galama & wijers 2001 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "2004 ; stratta et al . 2004 ; kann et al . 2006 ; schady et al . in preparation ) , owing to an observed lack of the 2175  feature thought to be caused by carbonaceous dust grains ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "this feature has , however , been clearly observed in grb afterglow spectra where the line of sight between us and the grb is intercepted by intervening systems : the best example to date , in which the extinction curve of an intervening system could for the first time be disentangled from that of the host galaxy , is grb060418 ( ellison et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in general , low amounts of optical extinction are found towards grbs , unexpected if grbs are located in dusty star - forming regions , whilst the x - ray spectra reveal a different picture ( first noted by galama & wijers 2001 ) . at x - ray wavelengths absorption",
    "is caused by metals in both gas and solid phase , predominantly oxygen and carbon ( see e.g. wilms et al . 2000 ) , and we often measure high values for the absorbtion columns . however , these absorption edges are shifted out of the x - ray observing window for high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) beyond which only large columns can be measured and there is a degeneracy between redshift and x - ray column density ( e.g. watson et al .",
    "the grb host metallicity is observed to be low ( compared with the milky way ) in measurements via optical spectroscopy of a dozen or so afterglows .",
    "host metallicities can reach values as low as 1/100 solar ( grb050730 , starling et al .",
    "2005 ; chen et al .",
    "2005 , but see also prochaska 2006 for potential caveats ) - even lower than found for the smc ( see figure 3 of fynbo et al .",
    "2006 for an overview ) .",
    "this only increases any measured x - ray column , which is expressed as an equivalent hydrogen column density , @xmath4 .",
    "but here we note that metallicities are not generally obtainable for lower redshift grbs ( @xmath5 ) due to the hydrogen lyman-@xmath6 line lying in the far uv outside typical observing windows .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between optical and x - ray extinction resulting in high gas - to - dust ratios in grb host galaxies ( often far higher than for the mw , lmc or smc , e.g. grb020124 , hjorth et al .",
    "2003 , but see schady et al . in preparation ) is not satisfactorily explained , though the suggestion that dust destruction can occur via the high energy radiation of the grb ( e.g. waxman & draine 2000 ) could possibly account for the discrepancy .",
    "it is thought that circumburst dust may be destroyed by sublimation of dust grains due to uv emission ( waxman & draine 2000 ) , sputtering ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) or dust grain heating and charging ( fruchter et al .",
    "alternative models for the extinction by dust grains , including skewing the dust grain size distribution towards larger grains , have been investigated , and in fact such a grain size distribution may result from exposure of the dust to the grb radiation field since destruction of small grains is more efficient than for larger grains ( perna et al .",
    "attempts to model the process of dust destruction have been made by e.g. perna & lazzatti ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , such models have not replaced smc - like ( low metallicity ) extinction as the best description of most grb environments ( e.g. stratta et al .",
    "2004 ; kann et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "traditionally the optical and x - ray spectra have been treated seperately in extinction studies . since the underlying spectrum is likely a synchrotron spectrum ( power law ( pl ) or broken power law ( bknpl ) , e.g. galama & wijers 1998 ) extending through both wavelength regions , it would be most accurate to perform simultaneous fits .",
    "more recently such fits have been made , either by fitting the x - ray spectrum individually and thereby transforming the model counts to flux to create a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with the optical data in flux space ( e.g. stratta et al . 2005 ; watson et al .",
    "2006 ) , or by using the _ swift _ xrt x - ray and uvot ultraviolet ( uv ) and @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9 band data together in a fit to the count spectrum ( e.g. blustin et al . 2005 ; schady et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the _ swift _ uvot data can be loaded directly into the xspec spectral fitting package and treated in count space owing to its calibration , which is generally not true for ground - based data .",
    "we present here an alternative method , which makes use of simultaneous fits in count space extending from near - infrared ( nir , in this case @xmath10 band ) to x - ray ( 10 kev ) to obtain the most accurate possible measurements of both the underlying continuum spectrum and the extinction .",
    "in section 4 we fit the broad - band seds ( from nir through x - ray ) of a subsample of the _ bepposax _ sample of grb afterglows to better measure the extinction properties of their host galaxies - a sample chosen for its availability of suitable data well studied in the seperate optical and x - ray band passes .",
    "section 2 outlines the data sample and reduction techniques .",
    "section 3 describes the method we use to model the broad - band seds and section 4 presents the results of our fitting through discussion of individual bursts and comparison with previous studies . in section 5",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings for galaxy extinction curves , and summarise and compare the various methods now available to measure extinction in the hosts .",
    "we conclude by summarising our method and findings in section 6 .",
    "an analysis of the blastwave parameters and density profiles for the circumburst media obtained from these fits will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( starling et al . , paper ii ) .",
    "this sample of 10 long grbs observed with the _ bepposax _ narrow field instruments ( approx . 0.110",
    "kev ) is chosen for the good availability ( 3 bands or more ) of optical / nir photometry ( tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the optical / nir bands available for each source and their references are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] . as these grbs are all previously studied , overlapping with the samples studied by galama & wijers ( 2001 ) and stratta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , this constitutes a good sample on which to first adopt this method of simultaneous sed fitting .",
    "all x - ray observations are taken from the _ bepposax _ data archives , using the lecs and mecs instruments raw data within the energy ranges 0.14 and 1.010 kev respectively .",
    "data have been reduced using the saxdas routines .",
    "we combined data from the mecs2 and mecs3 instruments ( except in the case of grb970228 , where we use the mecs3 instrument only , see stratta et al .",
    "2004 ) , including a gain equalisation .",
    "we then combined multiple observations for each source and instrument type among the narrow field instruments , omitting the last observation if it was @xmath11 3 days later than the previous one , before extracting spectra .",
    "background x - ray spectra were taken from blank fields and count rates checked against the local background finding no adjustments necessary : the net count rates of the two types of field agree on average to within 0.0001 counts s@xmath12 .",
    "the latest canned arf and rmf files were used with mecs data , but were created for lecs observations at their off - axis source positions ( listed in table 3 of stratta et al .",
    "we group all spectra such that a minimum of 20 counts are in each bin in order to use the @xmath13 statistic .",
    "however , in the case of grb000926 there were very few counts in the x - ray spectrum so we have required only 10 counts per bin .",
    "there is a known offset between the normalisations of the lecs and mecs instruments .",
    "we fit for this offset in the x - ray spectra only , adding a constant - value free parameter to the model and adopting mecs as the reference for the lecs instrument .",
    "we fix the offset values in the sed of each grb to these values ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .    all temporal decay slopes ,",
    "both for x - ray and optical lightcurves , have been taken from the literature and are listed together with galactic extinction corrections in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",

    "the seds and the results of fits to the seds for all grbs in the sample are listed in table  [ tbl-4 ] , and best fitting models are shown overlaid on the data in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows a comparison of the absorption measurements with galactic , lmc and smc gas - to - dust ratios , which we discuss in the following section .",
    "this plot has been constructed in a number of previous works ( e.g. galama & wijers 2001 ; stratta et al .",
    "2004 ; kann et al . 2006 ; schady et al . in preparation ) but here we show the observed distribution of @xmath14 and @xmath4 for the first time derived simultaneously from a fit to x - ray , optical and nir data .",
    "we find an excess in absorption above the galactic values particularly significant in two sources : grbs 000926 ( @xmath14 only ) and 010222 ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) , whilst no significant intrinsic absorption is necessary in grbs 970228 and 990510 .",
    "the cooling break can be located in three of the afterglows : grbs 990123 , 990510 and 010222 and to all other seds a single power law is an adequate fit .",
    "details are given below for each individual afterglow .",
    "no significant absorption is measured for grb970228 .",
    "we find only a single power law is required and it is possible to pin down the power law slope relatively well ( @xmath13/dof @xmath15 11.6/14 ) .      a well - defined temporal decay slope starting 1.9 days after trigger ( zeh et al . 2006 ) .",
    "preceding this time there is an increase in flux followed by an apparent flattening .",
    "the time of the x - ray observation log midpoint occurs a little before the 1.9-day break at 1.679 days , so we have extrapolated the optical data post 1.9 days back to 1.9 days and then assume that the evolution of the lightcurve is flat back to 1.679 days after trigger . to allow for a different behaviour before 1.9 days",
    "we include a constant value offset in the model between the optical and x - ray data , which we both fix at 1.0 and leave as a free parameter .",
    "the improvement in the fits when the offset is a free parameter is somewhat marginal .",
    "an f - test indicates that the free - parameter model is better at a 98% level , with the offset increasing to 3 .",
    "given the uncertain extrapolation , however , we use the fits with the offset as a free parameter in our further analysis .",
    "the best fitting model for grb970508 is a single power law with relatively low intrinsic x - ray absorption at the level of @xmath16 10@xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "kann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found a best fit with mw - like dust , but as we measure no significant optical extinction we can not distinguish between different extinction laws .",
    "grb971214 is the highest redshift source in the sample at @xmath0 = 3.418 , and we note that the source was faint , particularly as seen by lecs , crucial for the low x - ray energies .",
    "we measure an optical - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath19 of 0.6 and find that a single power law is an acceptable fit to these data .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray absorption appears to be extremely large whilst the optical extinction is moderately large , but we note that the high redshift of the grb makes measurement of the x - ray extinction more difficult . the curvature in the optical part of the spectrum has been previously interpreted as a cooling break ( wijers & galama 1999 ) and as extinction by either smc - like extinction ( stratta et al .",
    "2004 ) or by a presently unknown , more complex extinction law ( halpern et al .",
    "1998 ; ramaprakash et al .",
    "whilst smc extinction is the best fitting law of the 3 used here , it is not sufficient to accurately reproduce the shape of the optical sed , reflected in the large errors on @xmath4 and @xmath14 .      in the absence of an accurate redshift determination for grb980329",
    "we adopt the photometric redshift of @xmath0 = 3.6 ( jaunsen et al .",
    "2003 ) , hence all results must be taken with caution .",
    "the most striking feature of this sed is the apparent flux deficit in the @xmath20 band , which is present even after correction for galactic absorption and the probable high redshift .",
    "we tested for the possibility that the r - band flux deficit is due to the 2175  feature in the milky way extinction curve by fitting the pl+mw model whilst leaving the redshift as a free parameter lying between @xmath0 = 1.2 and @xmath0 = 4.2 ( jaunsen et al . 2003 ) ( we note that at @xmath0 = 3.6 the 2175  bump would lie between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands if extinction is mw - like , which is not observed ) .",
    "we obtain a fit with @xmath13/dof = 32.7/26 and @xmath0 = 1.95@xmath23 .",
    "the other best - fitting parameters , as listed in table 5 for standard fits , do not differ greatly from those found in the @xmath0 = 3.6 fit and the optical curvature is no better fitted .",
    "we also tested for the possibility that the r - band deficit is caused by a break in the power law , by allowing the break energy to reside within the optical regime ( and adopting @xmath0 = 3.6 with smc extinction ) . in this",
    "fit the break energy could not be well constrained , and the power law slopes are not well described by the difference of 0.5 as expected for a cooling break ( the second slope is steeper ) , hence we rule out this possibility . however , it is also possible that we are seeing an @xmath21 band excess rather than an @xmath20 band deficit .",
    "two late time @xmath21 band points taken at 110 days since burst ( yost et al .",
    "2002 ) appear not to agree with all of the @xmath21 band data used here ( reichart et al .",
    "1999 ) , which could be the result of overestimation of the early @xmath21 magnitudes , underestimation of the later @xmath21 magnitudes or the occurrence of color evolution . among the models applied to the whole grb sample here ,",
    "a single power law unabsorbed in the x - rays is the best fit , with a moderate @xmath14 of 0.178 and a slight preference for smc extinction .",
    "we caution that all the results are based on a redshift estimate equal to the mean of the sample spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath0 = 1.58 .",
    "a few attempts to constrain the redshift have not been very precise , amounting to 0.5@xmath243.6 or 1.5@xmath243.6 ( lower limits from jaunsen et al .",
    "2003 and upper limit from the fact that we detect a @xmath7 band counterpart ) .",
    "we find that a single power law with a small @xmath14 and x - ray absorption consistent with zero but with a large error is sufficient to model this afterglow .",
    "we note that the galactic x - ray extinction towards grb980519 is the highest for this sample which , together with the lack of known redshift hampers a good measurement of @xmath4 for this source .",
    "a single power law provides an acceptable fit to the spectrum , when absorbed by a large amount at both x - ray and optical / uv wavelengths . in this afterglow",
    "we measure the largest @xmath14 value in the sample of 0.29@xmath250.05 or @xmath26@xmath10.85 at 1.33 days after burst assuming smc extinction ( which is marginally preferred ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value found by bloom et al .",
    "( 1998b ) of @xmath27 , 5.3 days after the burst .",
    "a great deal of work has been done on the host galaxy properties of this burst because the host is bright , with optical extinction measurements by 5 groups .",
    "there is a hint that the optical extinction may be decreasing with time ( see e.g. holland et al . 2001 ) since measurements of @xmath26 at different times are inconsistent : @xmath26@xmath12.2 at 0.9 days , castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ; @xmath26@xmath11.5 at 1.2 days , vreeswijk et al . 1999 ; @xmath26@xmath10.3 at 4.4 days , djorgovski et al . 1998 ; @xmath10.9 at at 5.3 days , bloom et al .",
    "1998b , and there appears to be a discrepancy between the measured optical spectral and temporal slopes when assuming @xmath26 is constant .",

    "( 1999 ) , and in this study we obtain a lower value of @xmath28 = -0.92@xmath250.03 which would be completely consistent with @xmath29 = ( 1 + 2@xmath6)/3 = 0.9 using @xmath6 = 0.85 from zeh et al .",

    "grb990123 does not have significant x - ray absorption above the galactic value , and the optical extinction is consistent with zero .",
    "we set an upper limit to the latter which is ten times lower than the value found by savaglio et al .",

    "the latter authors note that the cooling break must lie at or above x - ray frequencies at that time .",
    "however , we find an improved fit with a broken power law , constraining the cooling break to 0.15 @xmath32 2.4 kev , within the x - ray spectrum , also found by stratta et al .",

    "( 2005 ) and maiorano et al .",
    "we note , however , that the x - ray spectrum comprises flux accumulated between 0.2 and 2.6 days since burst , including the proposed jet break time of 2 days ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "we tested for the possibility that the offset between optical and x - ray data was incorrect , but this made very little difference to our overall goodness of fit .",
    "it is possible that the cooling break has entered the x - ray band during these observations , since this break is expected to decrease in frequency with time . if this is the cooling break , the spectral slopes above and below the break differ by the expected factor of 0.5 when left free .",
    "we therefore took only the data from the first x - ray observation , before the jet break ( zeh et al .",
    "2006 ) , together with scaled optical / nir data , which has a log midpoint of @xmath10.7 days since trigger .",
    "we repeated all our fits .",
    "we find acceptable fits again only with the broken power law model , with the break energy lying somewhere between the optical and @xmath12 kev ( preferring central values just below x - ray frequencies , in line with our x - ray only analysis in which a single power law is a good fit to all spectra ) .",

    "we derive a better constrained value or upper limit to the extinction .",
    "the x - ray absorbing columns we measure are also generally consistent with those found by stratta et al . in a fit to the x - ray data only ( these are of course the same data used in our study , except for differences in number of observations combined for some sources , and we include grb000926 as well ) .",
    "our method obtains improved estimates for @xmath4 for 7 of the 9 sources common to both studies . for grb990510 stratta et al .",

    "kann et al . ( 2006 ) fitted only the optical seds for a sample of pre - swift bursts including 8 analysed here ( not including grbs 970228 and 980329 and using @xmath0 = 1.5 for grb980519 ) .",
    "we find similar central values of @xmath45 and improve upon their mean error by a reduction of 510 % .",
    "values disagree at the 90 % confidence level only for grb970508 , where we find an upper limit to the extinction which is 2.4 times lower than the lower limit of kann et al .",
    "but would be consistent with their estimate at the 3@xmath41 level .",
    "for half the afterglows the best - fitting model to the sed includes smc - like extinction ( as opposed to lmc or mw ) and in one case lmc - like extinction . in no cases is there a preference for mw - like extinction .",
    "we are sensitive to the 2175  bump ( mw ) in the redshift range @xmath0 = 0.469.9 , covering all our selected grbs , but clearly we do not detect any such feature . we find a wide spread in central values for the gas - to - dust ratios , and for 4 grbs the gas - to - dust ratios are formally inconsistent with mw , lmc and smc values at the 90 % confidence limit assuming the smc metallicity ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) . in these 4 cases",
    "the ratio is several orders of magnitude higher than the smc value of 4.4@xmath250.7@xmath3410@xmath35 @xmath18 mag@xmath12 ( koornneef 1982 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1985 ) and must mean that either gas - to - dust ratios in galaxies can span a far larger range than thought from the study of local galaxies , or the ratios are disproportionate in grb hosts because the dust is destroyed by some mechanisms ( likely the grb jet ) , or that the lines of sight we probe through grbs tend to be very gas - rich or dust - poor compared with random lines of sight through galaxies .",
    "finally , a dust grain size distribution which is markedly different than considered here may also affect these ratios .",
    "in fact , a recent study has shown that for the lmc the former is true",
    ". a recent observation of four core - collapse supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the lmc with spitzer has shown ir emission associated with the supernova blastwave ( williams et al .",
    "this is interpreted as dust with an lmc - like grain size distribution which has been collisionally heated by the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the observations require that some fraction of the small dust grains has been destroyed by sputtering by high energy ions in fast shocks .",
    "dust destruction is known to occur in snr shock fronts ( jones 2004 ) , and we will return to this issue later in the section .",
    "the derived gas - to - dust ratios are several times higher than the lmc ratio , as we see in the line - of - sight measurements of grbs and has been observed in other types of supernova ( e.g. borkowski et al .",
    "2006 ) , the cause of which is not known .",
    "we measure a large amount of intrinsic absorption in some of the sample ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) , and can state that absorption is insignificant in others , as seen for example in the contrast between grbs 010222 and 990510 .",
    "we have tested for the possibility that the galactic column density in the grb direction is affecting our intrinsic column derivations by plotting @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 , and found no correlation .",
    "we assumed therefore that all the measured absorption lies within the host galaxy .",
    "we note that a few of these afterglows have spectra : for grb990510 no intervening systems were clearly identified , an intervening system is measured at 168 km s@xmath12 from the host redshift for 000926 ( assumed to lie within the host galaxy , castro et al .",
    "2003 ) , 2 intervening systems are found for grb 010222 ( jha et al . 2001 ; mirabal et al . 2002 ) and at the host redshift there are two components separated by 119 km s@xmath12 ( mirabal et al .",
    "none of these intervening systems are close enough to us as the observer to significantly affect measurement of the intrinsic host extinction .      in this study we provided a thorough , uniform study of both optical and x - ray extinction along the lines of sight towards a sample of 10 grb afterglows .",
    "the well known spectral shape and relative brightness of the afterglow emission make grb afterglows a powerful line - of - sight probe of high redshift extinction .",
    "this is one of several approaches to measuring absorption in grb host galaxies .",
    "one can globally divide the studies of extinction in the field of grbs in two categories : line - of - sight extinction studies and studies of extinction of the integrated host galaxy or parts thereof .",
    "line - of - sight studies generally involve fitting the afterglow spectral energy distributions in optical and/or x - rays with template extinction models ( i.e. mw , lmc , smc or more parametrized models ) as we have done here . the standard conversions between x - ray extinction and optical extinction for the milky way and the two magellanic clouds are generally in disagreement with the column densities measured through this method , but these skewed gas - to - dust ratios are also being found in other astrophysical situations as discussed above for snrs in the lmc , and the destruction of dust can go some way to alleviating the mismatch .    a further way to probe line - of - sight extinction properties is through optical spectroscopy of the afterglow . in this case the careful measurement of column densities of heavy elements can be used to study the dust depletion pattern along the line of sight ( e.g. savaglio & fall 2004 ) .",
    "the measured metal column densities in combination with the best - fitting depletion pattern and the empirically determined conversion between @xmath45 and the dust column , can provide a prediction of the dust extinction along the line of sight to a grb ( for a detailed explanation see e.g. savaglio & fall 2004 ) .",
    "savaglio & fall ( 2004 ) show that the extinction derived from the dust depletion method is significantly higher than the value derived from direct fitting to the continuum of the afterglow spectrum , e.g. for grb020813 they find an overestimation by at least five times .",
    "we show that this conclusion holds when fitting the afterglow continuum emission over a much larger wavelength range and can quantify that overestimation factor for grbs 990123 , 000926 and 010222 as approximately @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 times overestimated respectively .",
    "the reasons for this apparent discrepancy may be two - fold : firstly the fitted extinction profiles to the afterglow sed are likely poor approximations to the true extinction profile , and secondly the host dust depletion chemistry may well differ from the milky way chemistry .",
    "in addition , the grb or afterglow may preferentially destroy small dust grains , skewing the extinction profile towards larger grains , resulting in a `` grey '' extinction curve .",
    "this would alter the derived extinction from sed fitting , and possibly bring estimates from dust depletion methods and sed fitting closer together . whist",
    "a grey extinction curve was the best fitting extinction curve to grb020405 ( stratta et al . 2005 ) , we note that grey extinction curves have been fitted to samples of afterglow seds with no conclusive improvement in fit ( e.g. stratta et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "one can also study the extinction properties of host galaxy as a whole , and there are again several methods to do this . whilst it has been shown that grbs occur in starforming regions in the host ( bloom et al .",
    "2002 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ) , many host galaxies are small and mixing timescales may be short , enabling global properties to be measured .",
    "the host and afterglow have similar , moderate reddening in grb000418 ( gorosabel et al .",
    "2003a ) which is taken as evidence that the ism is well mixed .",
    "but more extreme values of reddening are also seen , such as the extremely red afterglow and host of grb030115 , in which the host is an extremely red object ( ero , levan et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one of the most common methods of integrated host galaxy studies is fitting of the broadband optical and near - infrared seds of the hosts themselves ( e.g. christensen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "galaxy templates can be fit to the data , using photometric redshift programmes such as hyperz ( bolzonella et al .  2000 ) providing values for the photometric redshift , the age of the dominant stellar population and the extinction , by fitting a series of galaxy templates .",
    "the extinction measured this way is the extinction by the ism of the galaxy on the stellar light , @xmath51 , in which the geometry of the dust in the galaxy can play an important role ( e.g. dustlanes as opposed to an homogeneous dust distribution ) .",
    "a study of a large sample of hosts has been performed through hyperz template fitting by christensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find that grb hosts generally exhibit little extinction , and have young stellar populations .",
    "the dependence on metallicity and assumed initial mass function is small ( gorosabel et al .",
    "2003a , b ; christensen et al .",
    "one of the difficulties faced here is that the galaxies are often very faint .      in low redshift ( @xmath52 ) cases ,",
    "an optical spectrum of the host galaxy can be taken , typically showing several nebular and balmer emission lines .",
    "the balmer lines can be used to derive values for the reddening by calculating their deviation from case b recombination values expected in typical starforming region conditions ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the derived reddening @xmath53 is the reddening of the ionized gas in the source , i.e. the dominant starforming region(s ) producing the balmer emission lines . in general",
    "the reddening found from the balmer decrement is low ( see e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "2004 ) , to very low ( wiersema et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the two host galaxy extinction estimates @xmath53 and @xmath51 may be correlated for most galaxies ( see calzetti 2001 for a review ) .",
    "the increasing data volume on nearby grb host galaxies will allow a test of these correlations , providing further insight into effective grb host galaxy extinction curves .    on rare occasions",
    "it is possible to obtain high - resolution spectra of an afterglow that also shows host galaxy emission lines , allowing one to obtain a simultaneous view of the extinction along the line of sight and of the balmer decrement . in the case of grb060218 , both absorption lines and emission lines",
    "are detected at high resolution using the uves spectrograph on the vlt ( wiersema et al .",
    "the spectrum shows asymmetric emission lines that are well fitted with two gaussians separated by 22 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the same two velocity components can be seen in absorption in ca ii and na i , and have different chemical properties .",
    "these two systems can be interpreted as two seperate starforming regions , through which the light of the afterglow shines .",
    "a broadband measure of the extinction either from the afterglow or from template fitting of the host would not have been able to seperate out the contributions of the two individual systems .      yet another way to detect the presence of dust , is the detection of grb host galaxies in the far - infrared or sub - mm ( see e.g. barnard et al .",
    "2003 ; tanvir et al .",
    "2004 ) , where the uv radiation from massive stars is reprocessed by dust and reradiated in the far infrared .",
    "detection of hosts in the far infrared as well as optical can severely constrain their sed ( le floch et al .",
    "2006 ) , providing estimates for the unobscured star formation rate of grb hosts . in a few cases values",
    "up to hundreds of solar masses per year have been reported , while optical indicators give much lower values , indicating a lot of dust - obscured star formation .",
    "a different probe of unobscured star formation is the radio continuum flux , which is thought to be formed by synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons in supernova remnants and by free - free emission from h  ii regions ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "berger et al . ( 2003 ) performed a survey of host galaxies at radio and sub - mm wavelengths , finding that a significant fraction of grb host galaxies have a much higher radio - derived star formation rate than optical methods indicate , pointing again to significant dust extincted star formation but based on only a few detections .",
    "all methods considered , sed fitting of the afterglow as described and carried out in this paper is the most broadband view of line - of - sight properties . given the very well known underlying continuum shape , the extinction curve can in principle be extremely well modelled using this method .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , the effects of dust extinction in the optical are better measured at higher redshifts whereas the x - ray absorption is best measured at lower redshifts , so this method is most reliable for some middle range of redshifts centred around @xmath54 which approximately corresponds to the current _ swift _ median redshift ( e.g. jakobsson et al .",
    "2006b ) . as with any line - of - sight method",
    ", the measured columns may not be representative of the host galaxy as a whole , so comparison with the integrated host galaxy methods is important .",
    "the general drawbacks of this method lie in the inability to disentangle the locations of absorbers , both intervening ( between us and the host ) and within the host itself .",
    "intervening absorbers may be identified using afterglow spectroscopy ( ellison et al .",
    "distribution of absorbers within the host may be tackled from the point of view of searches for variability in the absorption which may indicate destruction of dust or ionisation by the grb and/or afterglow , and comparison of the measured columns with known absorbers such as molecular clouds .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 2006a ) find that the x - ray absorptions of 17 bursts ( including most of this sample ) are consistent with the grbs lying along random sightlines towards galactic - like molecular clouds .",
    "our sample is too small to make such a statistical comparison , but we note that the campana et al .",
    "sample includes the results of the stratta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) study of the grbs presented here for which we obtain largely consistent extinction values .",
    "dust destruction is of course impossible to measure in a single sed , but may be seen with multiple epochs of data .",
    "destruction of grains by for example the afterglow uv / x - ray emission would in principle be observable , because depletion indicative line ratios would vary on observable timescales as metals are released from grains into the ism .",
    "variable line emission has been searched for in afterglows with multiple optical spectra and has been seen in only two cases , grb020813 , in which the fe ii @xmath552396 transition equivalent widths decreases by at least a factor of five over 16 hours ( dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2006 ) and grb060418 in which several transitions of fe ii and ni ii are seen to vary in observations covering 11 to 71 minutes post - burst ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "this line emission is thought to arise at 50 - 100 pc from the grb site , possibly within range of the grb ionising flux .",
    "a variable @xmath45 has only been suggested for grb980703 ( described in section 4.1.6 ) .",
    "there is evidence for time variable x - ray absorption in a small number of grbs ranging from tentative to moderately strong , in particular for grbs 011121 ( piro et al .",
    "2005 ) , 050730 ( starling et al .",
    "2005 ) and 050904 ( bor et al .",
    "2006 ; campana et al .",
    "2006b ; gendre et al . 2006 ) and 060729 ( grupe et al .",
    "this implies ionisation of the line - of - sight gas , probably by the high energy grb jet ( though we note that column density changes and early - time spectral evolution can have similar effects on the spectrum ) .",
    "dust destruction can , however , only affect the immediate environment around a burst , ( perhaps out to 10 pc , waxman & draine 2000 ) , and not all the dust in that region need be destroyed since this depends on the efficiency of the mechanism and on the dust grain size distribution .",
    "kann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) noted a possible tentative correlation between @xmath26 and star formation rate as measured via host galaxy emission in the sub - mm ( for a sample of 7 grbs ) .",
    "if this turns out to hold when tested against larger samples it would demonstrate that a substantial amount of the dust we see comes from star forming regions located throughout the whole host galaxy rather than very close to the burst where it could be destroyed .",
    "however , this correlation is unlikely to be real given the very low resolution of the sub - mm observations which make it difficult to differentiate between host galaxy emission and field galaxy emission .",
    "this differentiation can be made with spitzer and lower star formation rates in comparison with the sub - mm derived values have been found for some hosts including those of grbs 980703 and 010222 ( le floch et al .",

    "<S> we use a new approach to obtain limits on the absorbing columns towards an initial sample of 10 long gamma - ray bursts observed with _ bepposax _ and selected on the basis of their good optical and nir coverage , from simultaneous fits to nir , optical and x - ray afterglow data , in count space and including the effects of metallicity . in no cases </S>",
    "<S> is a mw - like extinction preferred , when testing mw , lmc and smc extinction laws . </S>",
    "<S> the 2175  bump would in principle be detectable in all these afterglows , but is not present in the data . </S>",
    "<S> an smc - like gas - to - dust ratio or lower value can be ruled out for 4 of the hosts analysed here ( assuming smc metallicity and extinction law ) whilst the remainder of the sample have too large an error to discriminate . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a more accurate estimate of the line - of - sight extinction and improve upon the uncertainties for the majority of the extinction measurements made in previous studies of this sample . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this method to determine extinction values in comparison with the most commonly employed existing methods . </S>"
