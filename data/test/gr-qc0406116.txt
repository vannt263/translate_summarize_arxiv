    "einstein s theory of general relativity is described by a complicated set of coupled , nonlinear partial differential equations . like the maxwell equations of classical electromagnetism , the einstein equations are over - determined , and can be separated into hyperbolic evolution and elliptic constraint equations , as in the arnowitt  deser ",
    "misner ( adm ) decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of these equations is such that analytic solutions have been found for only very special configurations , and numerical studies arguably provide the only means to explore a wide variety of astrophysical and theoretically significant problems  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these numerical solutions are often prone to various instabilities , which we divide into three classes : ( 1 ) continuum instabilities , ( 2 ) numerical instabilities and ( 3 ) artificial long - term `` instabilities '' ( alti ) .",
    "_ continuum instabilities _ exist in the formulation of the continuum problem ( and thus are naturally reflected in any consistent numerical scheme ) , and are characterized by the solution itself or some perturbation of it either `` blowing up '' at a finite time or growing fast in time .",
    "these instabilities may reflect physical phenomena , such as turbulence in fluids or the threshold of black hole formation  @xcite , or may be an artifact of the formulation of the problem .",
    "for instance , ill - posed problems suffer from these instabilities , which also manifest themselves as numerical ones ( see  @xcite , and  @xcite for an illustration in numerical relativity ) .",
    "_ numerical instabilities _ are characterized by errors that , at a fixed time , _ increase _ as the discretization scale is decreased .",
    "these instabilities are present in many discretization schemes for well - posed problems that appear `` natural '' , such as the forward - time , centered - space scheme for the advection equation . finally , _",
    "alti _ are sometimes exhibited even by numerically _",
    "stable _ implementations , whenever errors grow too fast for the desired simulation time - scale and available computational resources .",
    "although these may not be instabilities in the strict sense , given that as defined here they are not present at the continuum and do go away with resolution , they are problematic in practice as they limit the time - length of a reliable simulation . in this paper",
    "we focus on this long - term error growth together with the application of the techniques described in  @xcite , which throughout this work we refer to as paper  i.    the stability of finite difference approximations ( fdas ) for simple initial value problems ( ivp ) with constant coefficients and periodic boundaries is often analyzed in discrete fourier space , by examining the norm of the amplification matrix .",
    "this method , however , does not generalize in a straightforward way to more complicated problems , such as those with variable coefficients or those with boundaries .",
    "a more powerful technique is based on the energy method  @xcite , also used to identify well - posed continuum problems .",
    "this method can be used in all problems for which the continuum energy method applies , e.g. , quasi - linear parabolic and symmetric hyperbolic partial differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the discrete formulation reproduces the continuum analysis , including the calculation of a discrete energy estimate , which can be used to meet sufficient conditions for a stable numerical method .",
    "combining these estimates with the consistency of the discrete system with the continuum problem , stability of the linear problem is equivalent to convergence via the lax equivalence theorem  @xcite . while our focus in general relativity is on the nonlinear einstein equations , stability of the linearized equations is obviously a necessary step for solving non - linear problems , in particular those with smooth solutions . in the absence of matter",
    ", smooth solutions are indeed expected in general relativity when appropriate slicing conditions are used  @xcite .    as described in paper  i ,",
    "a discrete energy estimate can be obtained when using finite difference operators that satisfy _ summation by parts _ ( sbp )",
    "@xcite , a discrete version of integration by parts , as well as appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite and time integrators  @xcite .",
    "paper  i presents and extends these techniques in the context of numerical relativity . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate these techniques using some common test problems employed in the field .",
    "we evolve klein  gordon scalar fields and maxwell fields on fixed schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "we also consider gauge wave spacetimes , obtained via coordinate transformations of flat spacetime .",
    "we show that we naturally obtain stable and convergent numerical schemes by construction , even when an inner boundary is used to remove the black hole singularity ( black hole excision )  @xcite .",
    "a second goal of this paper is to understand some causes of long - term error growth ( alti ) , and ways of eliminating or minimizing it by achieving _ strict stability _  @xcite .",
    "numerical solutions of the einstein equations are frequently plagued by such long - term errors .",
    "since at least some of these appear in numerically stable implementations , their cause is often attributed to the formulation of the equations . while this may be the case in a number of problems , as discussed below",
    ", some numerical experiments of simple differential equations with no continuum instabilities also display this same artificial long - term instability even when discretized in a numerically stable way. hence , it is important to devise _ numerical _ techniques to control this spurious growth in the numerical error .",
    "we find that this spurious error growth is allowed in the absence of sharp energy estimates for the discrete problem .",
    "this can arise , from among other reasons , because the discrete derivatives fail to satisfy the leibnitz rule . with this observation in mind , we discuss here a method to remedy some of these problems by constructing schemes that suppress excitations of alti .",
    "this work is organized as follows : we first summarize , in section ii , some results from paper  i , in order to introduce some notation .",
    "section  [ strict ] discusses the notion of strict stability , and we present simple examples of `` natural '' schemes that are numerically stable but not strictly stable , for which the errors grow fast in time .",
    "we then explain the basic strategy to achieve strict stability , and show how this eliminates alti . in section  [ equations ]",
    "we present some test problems from numerical relativity : three - dimensional scalar and electromagnetic fields propagating on a fixed schwarzschild black hole geometry , and one - dimensional perturbations of a dynamical slicing of flat spacetime ( `` gauge wave '' ) .",
    "the first cases allow us to test black hole excision , while the gauge wave has a time dependent background without a sharp energy estimate .",
    "however , a sharp energy estimate does exist for the subsidiary constraint system , and it can be used to understand the nature of the alti and suppress them . although more work would need to be done , these observations and ideas could be useful when evolving einstein s equations in more complicated situations . in section  [ simulations ] we present numerical simulations of the systems discussed in section  [ equations ] .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ smallness ] we discuss cubical excision boundaries for black hole spacetimes .",
    "we first review the construction of numerically stable finite - difference schemes using the discrete energy method for linear , symmetric hyperbolic initial - boundary value problems ( ibvps ) with maximally dissipative boundary conditions . while the discussion here is brief , further information can be found in the standard text by gustaffsson , kreiss , and oliger  @xcite , works by olsson  @xcite , and paper  i , for their particular application in numerical relativity .",
    "sufficient conditions for a stable discretization are fulfilled when :    1 .",
    "the continuum problem can be shown to be well posed using the energy method .",
    "2 .   spatial difference operators that satisfy sbp on the computational domain are used .",
    "boundary conditions are imposed via orthogonal projections  @xcite .",
    "the semi - discrete equations are integrated with a _ locally stable _ time integrator , e.g. , third or fourth order runge ",
    "kutta  @xcite .",
    "optionally , explicit dissipation may be added using operators that do not spoil the energy estimates , and different ways of writing the discrete equations may be explored to achieve strict stability .    as an example , consider a set of linear , symmetric hyperbolic equations on a one - dimensional domain , @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this domain is discretized with points @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , and a discrete scalar product , @xmath4 is introduced for some positive definite matrix with elements @xmath5 . in the limit",
    "@xmath6 this scalar product approaches the continuum one given by @xmath7 the standard continuum derivative operators and scalar products satisfy integration by parts : @xmath8 similarly , a discrete difference operator @xmath9 is said to satisfy sbp , if there is a scalar product with respect to which @xmath10 holds .",
    "the simplest difference operator and scalar product that satisfy sbp on this domain are @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the scalar product is diagonal : @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "higher order operators satisfying sbp have been constructed by strand  @xcite .",
    "domains with inner boundaries in several dimensions introduce additional complexities , and we refer the reader to paper  i for more information .",
    "we sometimes use explicit numerical dissipation . for that purpose we modify near boundaries the standard kreiss  oliger dissipative operator for second order derivatives , @xmath17 , so that it does not spoil the semi - discrete estimate , i.e. , so that it satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "the operator @xmath17 , which is fully described in paper  i , is added to the right - hand side of the evolution equations . in the absence of inner boundaries , it is ( on each direction ) @xmath19 we discretize the equations in time using the method of lines , and use third - order runge ",
    "kutta to integrate the equations .",
    "more precisely , for the ordinary differential system @xmath20 we integrate the solution @xmath21 , defined at time @xmath22 , to the advanced time , @xmath23 , obtaining @xmath24 , through @xmath25 where @xmath26",
    "throughout this paper we call artificial long - term instabilities ( alti ) those instabilities that are _ neither _ numerical  the errors at a fixed time do not become larger when the resolution is increased , but rather converge to zero_nor _ true instabilities of the continuous solution . these instabilities ,",
    "as shown in some examples below , can appear quite generically in long - term simulations .",
    "there are least two possible ways to suppress alti s :    1 .",
    "constructing _ strictly stable _ discretizations with respect to a conveniently defined energy .",
    "the equations are written such that a sharp continuum estimate also holds for the semi - discrete equations .",
    "the semi - discrete energy will then closely mirror the continuum energy estimate .",
    "explicit numerical dissipation can be used to eliminate high frequency errors , shifting the spectrum of the amplification matrix .",
    "although the latter solution is easy to implement , it may not be effective if the alti excites low frequency modes .",
    "the first solution , on the other hand , does not introduce artificial damping , but such a discretization may be difficult or even impossible to find for generic systems of equations .",
    "for example , no general sharp estimate for the full einstein equations is known at this time .",
    "thus , these two possibilities can be seen as complementary to each other .",
    "the energy of a solution , @xmath27 , of a set of linear partial differential equations is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a positive definite symmetrizer for the system .",
    "this energy is not unique , reflecting the freedom in choosing the symmetrizer , @xmath29 .",
    "the energy method provides an estimate for the growth rate of the energy in the form of an inequality , say , @xmath30 and thus provides a bound to the energy growth",
    ". this bound may be much larger than the actual growth rate for the continuum solution , in which case we say that the energy estimate is _ coarse .",
    "_ when the estimate is close to the actual energy growth rate of a solution , the estimate is _ sharp .",
    "_ while the behavior of the continuum solution is independent of a particular bound , as we discuss in this paper , numerical solutions sometimes do have a large growth if this is allowed .",
    "thus , the sharper the bound is , the smaller the possible spurious growth in the numerical solution .",
    "finding a sharp estimate is problem - dependent , and the definition of a convenient energy has to be analyzed on each case .",
    "one usually attempts to find a sharp energy bound by exploiting the freedom in choosing the symmetrizer .",
    "for example , a well - defined local physical energy exists in many physically motivated problems , which can be used to select a preferred symmetrizer .",
    "the evolution equations must be written such that they are symmetrizable with respect to this energy , but this is in general possible .",
    "although a locally positive definite energy for the einstein equations does not exist , relatively sharp estimates exist for some problems  @xcite .",
    "the energy method can be used to derive discrete estimates . using difference operators that satisfy sbp and representing the boundary conditions through orthogonal projections",
    ", the semi - discrete calculation mirrors the continuum analysis . when a discrete energy estimate is present , the discrete system is numerically stable by construction",
    ". a discrete system with the same energy estimate as the continuum problem may be defined as strictly stable .",
    "however , we are particularly interested in systems for which the energy estimate is sharp , and we therefore reserve the term _ strictly stable _ for discrete systems that match a sharp continuum energy estimate .    assuming a sharp energy estimate exists for the continuum problem , in this paper we consider how the discrete problem might be implemented to preserve this sharp estimate at the numerical level .",
    "this can be exploited to achieve long - term stability in an otherwise numerically stable but long - term unstable scheme . throughout this paper",
    "we only use numerically stable schemes , even when not explicitly mentioned .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on their long - term stability .",
    "finally , we note that the sharp energy estimates discussed here are for semi - discrete systems , where time is continuous but space has been discretized .",
    "a sharp estimate may , in principle , be lost owing to error introduced by the temporal integration .",
    "the experiments presented in this paper and in @xcite suggest that ( at least in the cases considered ) if strict stability is lost , the effects are not serious .",

    "namely , if the boundary becomes time - like , it will encounter the singularity in a finite amount of time .",
    "these two issues can be resolved simultaneously by adopting an inner boundary with a space - like world tube .",
    "this ensures it will not hit the singularity and that no boundary conditions are necessary if all the characteristics speeds are within the light cone , as the past domain of dependence of boundary points is wholly contained on the previous time slice .",
    "some freedom remains in choosing the particular region to be excised , and clearly the largest possible excision boundary is preferable to avoid the strongest gradients of the spacetime .    to illustrate some of these issues we now examine cubical excision for both the schwarzschild and kerr black holes , looking for the _ largest possible _ space - like excision cube .",
    "as we discuss below , the _ shape _ of the boundary plays a crucial role in satisfying the spacelike condition .",
    "we examine one face of the cube , a @xmath232 face .",
    "the condition that this surface is space - like implies that @xmath233 , as @xmath234 is the normal to the surface .",
    "since the coordinates are fixed _ a - priori , _ we can only vary the position of the boundary to meet this condition .",
    "we find that this condition is quite difficult to satisfy , and possible for only very slowly spinning black holes .    to see this in detail , consider the kerr metric in kerr ",
    "schild form  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath235 is @xmath236 where @xmath237 is related to the cartesian coordinates by @xmath238 the space - like character requirement on the surface implies that @xmath239 for the schwarzschild black hole , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and the above condition becomes @xmath242 the corner of the cube is the limiting point ( @xmath243 ) for the largest cube , giving the bound @xmath244 , or @xmath245 .    for the spinning black hole ,",
    "the analysis is slightly more involved .",
    "the limiting point for the largest cube is given by @xmath246 , @xmath247 , giving the condition @xmath248 examining this condition shows that cubical excision can not be used when @xmath249 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kerr_excise ] .",
    "furthermore , the singularity is not at a point , but is ring - like , implying that the cube may not be arbitrarily small . finding the minimum sized cube",
    "is more involved , as the faces of the cube need to be examined in addition to the corners  @xcite .",
    "this limitation of cubical excision for the schwarzschild spacetime was noted before  @xcite , by requiring that the excision boundary has no in - coming modes in a particular formulation of einstein equations .",
    "a similar analyzis to that of  @xcite for the kerr spacetime and cubical excision regions has also recently presented in  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to point out the following .",
    "first , when the eigenmodes are complete and the speeds are physical ( they lie within the null cone ) those results and the one presented here are equivalent , as it is rooted in the physical nature of the excision boundary .",
    "second , when dealing with a formulation admitting eigenspeeds outside the light cone , or a non - complete set of eigenmodes , the current straightforward analysis provides necessary conditions that have to be met .",
    "these necessary conditions are useful when dealing with any formulation , in particular one whose eigenspeeds might not be known .",
    "finally , we emphasize that these results are coordinate dependent ; nevertheless , for the families often used in numerical relativity tests , the same result applies . in particular for the family of slicings reported by martel and poisson  @xcite ( which contains both the kerr  schild and painlev ' e  gullstrand slicings of schwarzschild ) .",
