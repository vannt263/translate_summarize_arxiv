    "accretion discs play a central role in a wide range of astronomical environments , mediating the gas flows in the vicinity of object as diverse as agn , binary stars and protostars ( pringle , 1981 ) . in an accretion disc , the predominant flow is a circular shear flow , with angular velocity @xmath0 a function of radius @xmath1 from the central object .",
    "accretion takes place because of the action of some form of dissipation which releases the free energy of the shear flow as heat , and so allows the disc material to fall deeper into the potential well of the central object .",
    "simple physical energy arguments ( _ e.g. _ lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ) indicate that the dissipative process must take the form of a stress which transports angular momentum outwards .",
    "because the free energy of a circular shear flow is zero only if @xmath2 , it follows that the relevant element of the stress tensor must be of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "this can be deduced from the standard derivation of navier - stokes stress to be found in the fluid dynamics textbooks . however , in a recent paper , hayashi & matsuda ( 2001 ) have drawn attention to the fact that attempts to provide a physical explanation of the above result in terms of simple kinetic theory have resulted in failure .",
    "the simple kinetic explanation given in basic physics text books for the effect of viscosity on a simple linear shear flow , of the form @xmath5 in cartesian coordinates , relies on the fact that the kinetic particles conserve linear momentum between collisions .",
    "thus particles crossing some fiducial plane @xmath6 tend to mix up and smooth out the momentum distribution of the fluid and so give rise to a stress of the form @xmath7 .",
    "however , as hayashi & matsuda ( 2001 ) point out , it is in the application of these simple concepts to a circular shear flow that the problems seem to arise .",
    "the simple generalisation that , in a circular shear flow , the kinetic particles conserve angular momentum @xmath8 between collisions would imply , taken at face value , that the the movement of particles across some fiducial circle @xmath9 would tend to try to mix up and smooth out the distribution of angular momentum of the fluid , and thus that the stress would be proportional to @xmath10 ( see e.g. madej & paczynski 1977 ) . from the arguments given above",
    ", this is clearly wrong .",
    "not only would this predict a stress in the case when the shear @xmath11 is zero , but for a standard keplerian accretion disc for which @xmath12 it would transport angular momentum inwards rather than outwards . as detailed by hayashi & matsuda ( 2001 ) attempts to get round this and to produce the correct result have only succeeded by making mathematical errors in the derivation .    from all these problems ,",
    "hayashi & matsuda ( 2001 ) conclude that although what they call the derivation with mathematical rigour ( _ i.e. _ the usual navier - stokes argument ) gives the correct answer , in order to obtain the correct answer using kinetic theory one must take account of such complications as coriolis force . in this paper",
    ", we shall show that , although it is obviously necessary to include coriolis force if one works in a frame co - rotating with the flow , one can obtain the correct result from straightforward kinetic theory in the inertial frame .",
    "before we do so , it is instructive to return to the mathematical relationship between stress and strain derived in the standard fluid textbooks ( see , for example , batchelor , 1967 , section 3.3 ) .",
    "the basic point we wish to make is that the standard navier - stokes expression for momentum transfer ( _ i.e. _ stress ) is based on a simple _ physical _ argument .",
    "the argument may involve the use of tensors , which physicists tend to meet in courses on mathematical methods , but the argument itself is not a mathematical one .",
    "the point is that stress ( momentum transfer ) in a fluid ( or in a solid ) can be expressed as a second order tensor .",
    "this is a physical ( and not a mathematical ) statement , in exactly the same sense that the statement that a velocity is a first order tensor ( i.e. a vector ) is a physical , and not a mathematical , statement . for a fluid ,",
    "the physical _ ansatz _ is simply that the stress tensor must be physically related to the rate of strain tensor ( which is a second order tensor which derives from the first derivatives of the velocity field , and thus incorporates information about the shear ) .",
    "the simplest assumption is that relationship between these two tensors is through a ( fourth order ) tensor which is isotropic .",
    "it is this assumption of the isotropy of the relationship , which is based on the physical assumption that the fluid itself is isotropic , which gives rise to the standard navier - stokes expression for the viscosity .",
    "it is important to realise that these tensors ( _ i.e. _ scalars , vectors , second order tensors ) exist as physical quantities , independent of any coordinate system .",
    "the statement that there is a relationship between two of them is a physical statement .",
    "it is only when one has to calculate a particular element of the stress tensor , for example corresponding to linear momentum transfer in a linear shear flow , or to the angular momentum transfer in a circular shear flow , that one has to evaluate coordinate dependent expressions , which can get mathematically complicated .",
    "but when one does this , one finds that the flux of linear momentum in a linear shear flow just depends on @xmath13 , and that the angular momentum flux in a circular shear flow just depends on @xmath14 . however , this result also enables us to draw another conclusion . the reason for the difference between the terms @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath11 is due solely to the difference between the coordinate systems .",
    "that is , it comes from geometry alone .",
    "this implies that when looking for differences in derivations for simple kinetic theory formulae between the linear and circular shear flows , we need only concern ourselves with geometry , and not with dynamical complications such as coriolis force .",
    "in addition , we also need to take note of the fact that the navier - stokes expression does depend critically on assumptions about isotropy of the fluid .",
    "thus we should expect to have to make a similar assumption about the properties of our kinetic particles .",
    "in this section we compute the relationship between stress and ( rate of ) strain for two simple shear flows using kinetic theory . to keep the concepts and the algebra simple",
    ", we make a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "we work in two dimensions only .",
    "that is , we assume that the kinetic particles ( assumed to be identical , with mass @xmath16 ) move only in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "we assume that the net effect of the scattering processes within the fluid is that these particles are emitted at a constant rate at each point of the fluid , and that each particle is emitted with an identical velocity , @xmath17 , relative to the local fluid .. we represent by @xmath18 the number of particles emitted per unit area per unit time that travel a distance greater than @xmath19 before colliding with another particle and we assume that @xmath18 is independent of position .",
    "the requirement of isotropy , as discussed above , can now be imposed by making the assumption that this emission takes place at each place in the fluid isotropically _ in the frame of the fluid _ at that place .      in cartesian",
    "@xmath20 coordinates we let the background fluid flow be of the form    @xmath21    we consider the stress acting on a line element , length @xmath22 , centred at point s , at position @xmath23 , and lying in the @xmath24direction , that is , with unit normal in the @xmath25direction . for a linear shear flow , we consider the case    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a constant . note",
    "that although we consider here a linear shear flow with constant shear , any linear shear flow can be treated as a constant shear for @xmath28 and with @xmath29 , evaluated at @xmath30 .    for convenience , we work in the frame comoving with the mean fluid flow at s. this frame is an inertial frame , and in this frame the mean flow is given by    @xmath31    we now focus on particles that are emitted from a point e that is located at a distance @xmath19 from s and where the line se makes an angle @xmath32 with the negative @xmath25axis ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "the critical point is that _ in the frame of the fluid at _ e the particles that travel along es are emitted at an angle @xmath33 to the @xmath25axis where the relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath32 is simply deduced by considering the ratio of the @xmath25 and @xmath24components of the particle velocity in the rest frame of s , _",
    "@xmath34    we consider the limit that the shear velocity across a typical mean free path is much less than the random particle velocity ( _ i.e. _ @xmath35 ) , so that ( to o@xmath36 ) we may write    @xmath37    @xmath38    and @xmath39    in order to compute the rate of arrival of @xmath40-momentum at s due to particles originating near e , we consider a patch around e that is a portion of an annulus centred on s ( radius @xmath19 , thickness @xmath41 ) where the patch subtends an angle @xmath42 at s ( see figure 1b )",
    ". the rate of emission of particles from this patch that travel far enough before colliding to be able to reach s is simply @xmath43 .",
    "such particles emanate isotropically from e _ in the rest frame of the fluid at _ e. thus the fraction , @xmath44 , of such particles that impinge on the line element @xmath22 at s is    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the distance traveled by the particles between e and s _ in the rest frame of the fluid at _ e. the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath19 is simply ascertained by noting that the relative velocity between e and s is zero in the @xmath25direction and hence that the distances travelled in the @xmath25direction between e and s in the two frames is thus equal ( i.e. @xmath47 ) from which we deduce , to first order in @xmath19 ,    @xmath48    and thus that    @xmath49    finally , the @xmath24velocity of each particle emitted from around e is    @xmath50    which ( using equation  [ sintheta ] ) may be approximated as    @xmath51    thus the total rate of arrival of @xmath40-momentum at s from the patch at e is    @xmath52    substituting for @xmath44 and @xmath53 from equations  [ f ] and  [ vy ] we may obtain , to the order of our approximation , the total rate of arrival of @xmath24momentum at s by integrating over @xmath32 and @xmath19 , in the form    @xmath54    since we are only considering the momentum flux due to particles arriving from one side of the line element ( that is , particles with @xmath55 ) , then @xmath56 runs from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59    [ we note that the simple arguments found in many physics text books for kinetic theory viscosity in a linear shear flow , do _ not _ correctly take account of the fact that the particle velocity distribution is isotropic in the frame of the fluid at the point of _ emission _",
    "( i.e. last collision ) , rather than at the point where the momentum flux is measured ( see for example , jeans 1940 ) . in a linear shear flow",
    ", this error only changes the coefficient in front of the viscosity coefficient and retains the correct form of the equation for the resulting viscous stress . in the circular case",
    ", however , we shall find that it is necessary to treat this subtlety correctly , even in order to obtain the correct functional form of the viscous stress ] .",
    "we now carry out essentially the same analysis , but this time for a circular shear flow .",
    "we still work in an inertial frame , ( that is , a frame in which the particle trajectories are straight lines ) but in this case the underlying fluid flow is , in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath60 , of the form",
    "@xmath61    we consider the stress acting on a ( small ) line element , length @xmath22 , centred at point s which in cartesian coordinates , centred at the origin o ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath62 ) , lies at @xmath63 .",
    "the line element lies in the azimuthal direction , and so has unit normal in the radial @xmath64direction . as before , we work in the _ inertial _ frame that co - moves with the mean fluid flow at s and again consider the limit that the shear across a mean free path @xmath19 is much less than the random velocity @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath65 ) . , and",
    "thus this approximation implies that @xmath66 .",
    "thus our analysis does not cover astrophysical situations in which the mean free path is comparable to , or larger than the disc thickness ( paczynski , 1978 ; brahic , 1977 ) ] we note that , since @xmath67 , it is also the case that @xmath68",
    ". we defer until the end of this section a discussion of the constraints placed on @xmath19 by our neglect of the curvature of particle orbits between collisions .    .    as before ,",
    "we consider particles that are emitted in the vicinity of a point e , located at distance @xmath19 from s where es makes an angle @xmath56 with the inward directed radius vector at s. the only difference from the foregoing analysis is that since the streamlines are now circular , the velocity of the mean flow at e with respect to that at s has non - zero components in both the @xmath25 and @xmath24directions ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "specifically , the point e is located at radius @xmath69 ( to o@xmath70 ) where the velocity of the mean flow ( with respect to the origin ) is in the azimuthal direction and of magnitude @xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 being respectively the angular velocity and its gradient evaluated at s ) .",
    "the radial vector at e makes an angle    @xmath74    with the @xmath25axis .",
    "consequently the @xmath25 and @xmath24components of the mean flow velocity at e with respect to a frame co - moving with the mean flow at s are ( to o@xmath70 )    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    as before , we can establish the relationship between the angles @xmath32 and @xmath33 using    @xmath77    so that , in this case ,    @xmath78    @xmath79    and @xmath80    we note the similarity of these three equations to equations  [ tantheta ]   [ sintheta ] , since in the circular flow @xmath81 corresponds simply to @xmath82 . in each equation there is , however , an additional term ( proportional to @xmath72 ) which takes care of the fact that the mean flow is not plane - parallel in this case , and that hence each emission point has a non - zero velocity with respect to s along the radial vector at s ( see equation  [ vxrel ] ) .",
    "this modification in the relationship between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is crucial in explaining the different form of the viscous stress in the circular case .",
    "we also need to modify the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath19 compared with what we had previously , which we can do most simply by equating the time of flight es ( @xmath83 ) with the time ( @xmath84 ) required to traverse the distance @xmath85 that separates e and s in the @xmath25direction .",
    "after some algebra we obtain the expression    @xmath86    and hence find in this case that    @xmath87    finally , the @xmath24velocity of each particle emitted from e is    @xmath88    and hence , to the order to which we are working ,    @xmath89    comparison of equations  [ f ] and  [ vy ] with equations  [ fcirc ] and  [ vycirc ] shows that the expressions are identical except in as much as @xmath81 in the linear shear flow is replaced by @xmath90 in the circular case .",
    "thus ( following the same procedure for finding @xmath91 as previously  that is , by integrating contributions to the @xmath40-momentum flux from all points with @xmath92 ) we obtain ( by analogy with equation  [ pydot ] ) :    @xmath93    we note that this analysis recovers the ` correct ' answer ( as given by the usual navier - stokes argument ) that whereas the viscous stress in a linear shear flow depends on the velocity gradient , in the case of a circular flow the viscous stress instead depends on the gradient of _ angular _ velocity .    finally , we turn to the issue of our neglect of the curvature of particle orbits between collisions .",
    "this neglect is always justified , for example , in the case of laboratory couette flow , where the fluid is not subject to external long range forces . in the case",
    "that the acceleration of the mean flow _ is _ provided by a long range central force ( _ i.e. _ by a force that is experienced by the particles between collisions , as in the case of a keplerian accretion disc ) then the change in ( @xmath94- ) velocity of a particle between collisions is @xmath95 . if @xmath96 we can repeat the above analysis by adding @xmath97 to @xmath98 ( equation 19 ) and hence modifying the subsequent equations relating @xmath33 to @xmath32 .",
    "we find that ( to o(@xmath99 ) the relation between @xmath46 and @xmath19 ( equation ( 25 ) ) and hence the expression for @xmath44 ( equation ( 26 ) ) is unchanged by this addition but that @xmath53 ( equation ( 28 ) ) now contains an additional term ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this term however makes a zero contribution to the @xmath40-momentum flux , when integrated over @xmath56 , since the contributions from @xmath101 cancel .",
    "we thus find that our analysis is independent of the nature of the central force providing the acceleration of the mean flow , provided that @xmath96 .. be much less than the shear velocity across a particle mean free path @xmath102 , and that indeed this latter condition _ can not _",
    "be met in a thin keplerian accretion disc .",
    "we however find that the symmetry of the terms in the momentum flux involving @xmath97 ensures that their contribution can be neglected , compared with those involving @xmath102 , even when @xmath103 this requirement translates into a condition on @xmath19 for a thin keplerian disc of the form @xmath104 , which is more stringent than the condition ( @xmath105 ) derived above in order to justify our approach of expanding quantities to first order in @xmath106 .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to obtain the correct expression for the momentum transfer in a both a linear and a circular shear flow using simple kinetic theory .",
    "this correct expression implies that an isotropic viscosity transfers momentum _ down _ an angular velocity gradient . we have noted that it is essential to take proper account of both the geometry and the fluid s isotropy .",
    "our analysis allows us to understand the flaw in the simple heuristic argument applied to a circular shear flow ( described in section 1 ) , which leads to the conclusion that since angular momentum is conserved along particle trajectories , it is the gradient in angular momentum which particle mixing tends to smooth out .",
    "particles arrive at the reference patch , at point s , with momentum along the streamline ( @xmath24momentum ) that derives from two sources ",
    "( i ) the @xmath24component of the random emission velocity ( assumed isotropic in the local rest frame of the emission point ) and ( ii ) the @xmath24component of the streaming velocity of the emission point relative to the reference patch .    the usual argument given to explain the momentum transfer in a _ linear _",
    "shear flow is simply that ( ii ) has the same sign for all the emission points on one side of the reference patch and so that momentum is added to , or subtracted from , the reference patch just depending on the sign of the velocity gradient in the mean flow .",
    "in fact , there is another contribution , equal in magnitude and sign to that described above , which may be understood by considering the particles that are incident at the reference patch from @xmath107 . from figure 3",
    "it may be seen that the @xmath25velocity ( and hence flux ) of particles on the @xmath108 side exceeds that on the @xmath109 side ( _ i.e. _ there is a greater flux of particles at the reference patch whose emission is prograde than retrograde ) .",
    "since the @xmath24momentum from ( i ) far exceeds that from ( ii ) , this slight asymmetry in the fluxes of prograde and retrograde particles produces a net momentum flux that is equal to the more obvious source of momentum flux described above .",
    "we may now apply the same considerations to the _ circular _ shear flow , where once again there are the two contributions to the @xmath24momentum  ( i ) and ( ii ) described above .",
    "the important difference now is that the mean streaming velocity is no longer in the @xmath24direction .",
    "the geometry of the circular arc ensures that this contributes a positive ( negative ) @xmath25velocity for @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "as may be seen from figure 4 , particles that are incident from @xmath108 ( prograde particles ) have a larger amplitude of both @xmath111 and @xmath53 than those from @xmath112 .",
    "this ensures that the mean @xmath24velocity of particles arriving at the reference patch from a particular emission streamline is not equal to the mean @xmath24velocity of particles on that emission streamline .",
    "this disparity is because of the relative boost in the arrival flux of particles whose random velocity is prograde in the frame of the emission streamline , compared with those that are retrograde .",
    "this now allows us to understand the behaviour of a keplerian accretion disc at a qualitative level .",
    "the mean angular momentum of particles orbiting at radii less than that of the reference patch is less than that of the reference patch . if the distribution of angular momenta of the particles arriving at the reference patch merely reflected the distribution of angular momenta of particles on their parent emission streamlines",
    ", this would imply that the arrival of particles at the reference patch from smaller radii should exert a spindown torque .",
    "instead , the relative boost in the _ arrival rate _ of particles that are emitted in the prograde direction , ensures that the average angular momentum of the particles arriving at the reference patch exceeds the average at the parent streamline . in the keplerian case ,",
    "this relative boost in the arrival rate of the prograde particles is enough to reverse the sign of angular momentum transfer .",
    "thus , particles arriving at the reference patch from smaller radii exert a spin up torque , as required .",
