    "in this paper we study the effects of rotation on the radiation driven winds of early - type supergiants .",
    "we will focus on the explanation for the occurrence of disks around fast rotating b[e ] supergiants .",
    "b[e ] supergiants , also designated sgb[e ] stars ( lamers et al .",
    "@xcite ) , are b type supergiants that exhibit forbidden emission lines in their optical spectra . the observations of hybrid spectra , i.e. spectra with _ broad _",
    "uv p cygni features and _ narrow _ emission lines and dust emission of b[e ] supergiants in the magellanic clouds led to the proposal of a disk wind model by zickgraf et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "this model postulates a dense disk of outflowing material in a fast line driven wind to explain the observed characteristics of the spectra of these stars ( see zickgraf  @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar wind at the equator is about ten times slower than that at the pole .",
    "also , the wind at the equator is about a hundred times denser than at the pole . additional evidence for a two - component outflow has been obtained from polarimetric measurements , e.g. by zickgraf & schulte - ladbeck  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the precise mechanism behind the formation of these disks is still a mystery ( cassinelli 1998 ) .",
    "it is however clear that the origin of an axisymmetric wind structure such as a disk may well be connected to the fast rotation of a star .",
    "two theories using rotation in a different way have been considered for the formation of these disk winds :     ( 1 ) the wind compressed disk ( wcd ) model of bjorkman & cassinelli  ( @xcite ) , that invokes the kinematics of the winds from rotating stars .",
    "the streamlines of the gas in the wind from both hemispheres of a rapidly rotating star cross in the equatorial plane .",
    "the concentration of the gas and the shock in the equatorial plane produce an outflowing equatorial disk , with a thickness on the order of a few degrees .",
    "owocki & cranmer ( 1994 ) have argued that the motion to the equatorial plane may be counteracted by the radiation force perpendicular from the plane due to lines .",
    "however , this `` wind - inhibition effect '' may not be effective in winds with a strong density gradient in the equatorial direction .",
    "we return to this in sect .",
    "( 2 ) the rotationally induced bi - stability model ( rib ) of lamers & pauldrach   ( @xcite ) invokes an increase in the mass flux from the equator and a decrease in the equatorial wind velocity compared to the poles from the bi - stability jump .",
    "this jump in mass flux and in wind velocity is due to the temperature difference between the pole and the equator of a fast rotating b[e ] supergiant with gravity darkening .",
    "the jump will occur for stars with effective temperatures between 20  000 and 30  000 k.    in reality , both effects , i.e. the wind compression and the rotation induced bi - stability , may be operating together and amplifying one another in the line driven winds of rapidly rotating early - b stars .",
    "( for a detailed explanation of both models , see lamers & cassinelli ( 1999 ) ( hereafter @xmath5 ) , chapter 11 . )",
    "the theory of radiation driven winds for non - rotating stars was developed by castor et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( hereafter cak ) and predicts the mass loss rate and @xmath6 for spherical winds .",
    "the influence of rotation on line driven winds was investigated by friend & abbott ( @xcite ) .",
    "they found an increase in the mass - loss rate at the equator and a corresponding decrease in @xmath6 , but these authors did not consider the effects of gravity darkening and the oblate shape of the star .",
    "cranmer & owocki  ( @xcite ) described the finite disk correction factor in case of an oblate star .",
    "in this paper we will modify the line driven wind theory , including these effects of oblateness and gravity darkening as well as the rotational terms in the equation of motion .",
    "this will then be applied to rapidly rotating b[e ] supergiants to investigate whether these effects can explain the occurrence of disks .",
    "we will also apply recent bi - stability calculations to study the effect of the rib - model to explain the occurrence of outflowing disks around rapidly rotating b[e ] supergiants .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe the theoretical background of the radiation driven wind theory and the bi - stability effect . in sect .",
    "3 we derive the equations for the winds from oblate rotating stars with a temperature gradient between poles and equator due to gravity darkening . in sect .",
    "4 we describe the method for solving the equations and for calculating the winds from rotating stars .",
    "these calculations will be applied to b[e ] supergiants in sect .  [ s_b[e ] ] .",
    "in sect .",
    "[ s_bs ] we will investigate the effect of bi - stability on rotating stars and sect .",
    "[ s_concl ] concludes with a summary of this work and a discussion on the formation of disks of b[e ] supergiants .",
    "the computation of the dynamics of line driven stellar winds is a complicated problem in radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "it involves the simultaneous solution of the equations of motion , the rate equations and the radiative transfer equations in order to calculate the radiative acceleration .    for hot luminous stars the line forces are the most important driving forces in the wind .",
    "cak have shown that the line acceleration can be parameterized in terms of the optical depth parameter @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are parameters that depend on composition and temperature of the wind . in this expression @xmath0",
    "is a measure of the number of lines and @xmath1 is a measure of the distribution of the line strengths with @xmath9 or 1 for a pure mix of optically thin or thick lines respectively .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the cak formalism and simplify the equations of motion by assuming a stationary , radial flow of a viscousless fluid .",
    "the possible influence of magnetic fields will be ignored .",
    "these simplifications are subject to the following restrictions ( see e.g. abbott 1980 ) :    * the cak theory treats the line acceleration in a simplified way in terms of the force multipliers , described above .",
    "detailed calculations of the line driving , including millions of lines , show that the total line acceleration can be well described by this simple representation ( pauldrach et al .",
    "both observations and calculations show that line driven stellar winds are not stationary .",
    "even a wind in a stationary solution will develop shocks ( see e.g. lucy  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the time - averaged structure follows the stationary state quite well ( see owocki et al .",
    "@xcite , and feldmeier 1999 ) .",
    "therefore we will restrict ourselves to stationary models . *",
    "a sectorial model will be adopted .",
    "this means that for every latitude a one dimensional problem will be solved .",
    "wind compression as in the wcd model will thus be neglected , but the main effect of wind compression is expected to _ redistribute _ the mass loss and not to change the _ total _ mass that is lost from the rotating star . * the absence of viscosity is a good approximation at the high density of line driven winds ( see cak ) .",
    "the representation of the line force by a simple power law may seem to be a gross simplification of the underlying physics of myriad line absorption processes , but it can be shown to hold for a homogeneously distributed mix of optically thick and thin lines ( abbott  @xcite , gayley  @xcite ) .",
    "calculations of cak and more recently in nlte by vink et al .",
    "( @xcite ) of realistic model atmospheres , based on calculations of unified atmosphere / wind models with the isa - wind code ( de koter et al .",
    "1997 ) , confirm this to be generally true to good accuracy for the important part of the wind ( from about the sonic point up to a few stellar radii ) .",
    "therefore , the complex physics of ion populations can be ignored in the investigation of the various effects of rotation on the stellar wind .",
    "however , there is one notable exception which is called the bi - stability jump .",
    "this refers to a jump in @xmath6 around the temperature of 21000 k where @xmath10 climbs from 1.3 ( lower temperature ) to 2.6 ( higher temperature ) .",
    "this jump was observed by lamers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in b supergiants .",
    "it is linked to a shift in ionization states of fe in the lower part of the wind .",
    "the line driving in the lower part of the wind is dominated by iron .",
    "below about @xmath11 k , fe iv recombines to fe iii and since fe iii is a more efficient line driver than fe iv , the wind structure changes dramatically ( vink et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the bi - stability jump may also occur in the temperature difference between the pole and the equator of a fast rotating star with gravity darkening .",
    "therefore two sets of force multiplier parameters for the wind will be adopted to reflect the sudden change in ionization states ( a high - temperature set for the pole and a low - temperature set for the equator ) .",
    "intuitively it is clear that rotation has an effect on the shape of a star and on the motion of the gas in the wind .",
    "an additional effect that the rotation of a star can have is the darkening of the equatorial regions of a star via the von zeipel effect .",
    "these effects will modify the wind of a star considerably and we will incorporate them in the line driven wind theory for rotating stars .",

    "the von zeipel theorem  ( @xcite ) for distorted stars states that the radiative flux from a point on the star is proportional to the local effective gravity : @xmath28 with @xmath29 the boltzmann constant . as @xmath30 , we can write down the flux of a rotating star as a function of the co - latitude @xmath14 . this ( lengthy ) expression for the flux as a function of @xmath14",

    "figure  [ fg_ldens ] shows the resulting density contrast ( far from the star ) between pole and equator ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the densities at pole and equator are essentially the same : the smaller @xmath6 at the equator is offset by the larger mass loss rate @xmath135 at the pole .",
    "[ fg_dc ]    we have also calculated models for different luminosities ( see table 2 ) , and different stellar masses ( see table 3 ) . the mass - loss rate for the different luminosities is also plotted in fig .  [ fg_mp ] . the density contrast for various luminosities is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg_ldens ] .",
    "we see that the density at the pole compared to the equator increases for increasing luminosity and the effect on the mass - loss rate is only visible for the highest luminosity .",
    "this is an effect of the continuum acceleration @xmath54 .",
    "7 illustrates the effect of the continuum acceleration on the forces in the wind for a star with high luminosity ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the net effect of the continuum radiation pressure and the gravity , i.e. @xmath163 , is an inward force in the equatorial region and an outward force in the polar region where the flux is higher .",
    "for small luminosity the variation in @xmath164 through @xmath54 is not important because @xmath47 itself is small . for high luminosity @xmath165 increases and thus the effect of @xmath166 on @xmath164",
    "becomes noticeable ( this is with all other properties of the star fixed ) . in eq .",
    "[ eq_vinfsimple ] we see that a larger value of @xmath166 at the pole causes a relatively larger decrease ( through @xmath164 ) in @xmath27 and thus in @xmath6 , whereas the mass loss rate at the equator will increase less because of the smaller @xmath54 .",
    "this is only a qualitative explanation and the actual dependence of @xmath167 does not follow the relation suggested by eqs . 29 and 31 .",
    "we have found that the actual values of @xmath167 could be approximated quite well ( within 10 percent ) with the following relation :    @xmath168    where the @xmath169 is the radius where @xmath54 reaches its minimum value .",
    "so we see that although rotation alone modifies the wind structure considerably , it can not be responsible for the density contrast between the equatorial and polar wind observed in b[e ] stars , in case only radial effects are considered .",
    "we conclude that at least one other physical effect must be responsible for the formation of disks of rotating b[e ] stars .",
    "the two most likely additional effects are the bi - stability and the flow of the wind material towards the equator .",
    "in the section above we have shown that rotation alone can not explain the observed large density contrast between the poles and the equator of b[e ] stars .",
    "one of the possible additional mechanisms to enhance this contrast is the bi - stability jump .    to investigate whether the bi - stability jump observed in normal b - supergiants can explain the formation of disks around b[e ] stars , we have calculated bi - stable wind models for a fast rotating typical b[e ] supergiant .",
    "spherical , nlte wind models for normal b supergiants have been calculated by vink et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . from these models",
    "cak - like force multiplier parameters have been derived using a monte - carlo method to simulate photon - gas interactions .",
    "these models show the occurence of a bi - stability jump around @xmath11 k.    for two models on either side of the bi - stability jump ( @xmath170 = 17 500 and 30 000 k ) , the cak parameters were determined by fitting a power law from about the sonic point to about @xmath171 ( from @xmath172 to @xmath173 in optical depth , @xmath75 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq_t ] ) to the calculated force multiplier values .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are listed in table  [ tb_ka ] .",
    "note that the @xmath2 parameter is taken equal to zero as it was not possible to extract it explicitly from the models .",
    "its effect is hidden in the constant @xmath0 . as expected , the values for the force multiplier parameters are quite different for the two cases , because the ionization has changed dramatically over the bi - stability jump .",
    "cccc & @xmath0 & @xmath1 & @xmath2 + 17500 k & 0.57 & 0.45 & 0.0 + 30000 k & 0.06 & 0.65 & 0.0 +    [ tb_ka ]    the predicted bi - stability jump occurs around @xmath174 kk .",
    "therefore we calculated a model for a rotating b[e ] star with the following properties : @xmath175 k , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and solar abundances .",
    "this implies that the pole of the rapidly rotating star will be hotter than 25 kk and the equator will be cooler than 25 kk .    for the pole , the force multipliers @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the hot monte carlo model of 30 000 k were used , whereas for the equator , @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the cool model of 17",
    "500 k were used .",
    "the resulting @xmath178 and mass loss rates @xmath38 are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fg_vtheta ] and [ fg_mdtheta ] for @xmath31 = 0.6 .",
    "clearly visible is the drastic decrease in @xmath6 and the drastic increase of @xmath135 towards the equator .",
    "this occurs around a co - latitude @xmath14 ( angle from the pole ) of about 60 degrees , where @xmath179 k. ( the precise location of the jump depends on the effective temperature of the star ) .",
    "since both @xmath135 and @xmath6 have a equator / pole contrast of about a factor of three , the resulting density contrast is about a factor of 10 in a disklike region with a half opening angle of 30 degrees .",
    "our calculations show that the density contrast in the wind between pole and equator due to the bi - stability jump is significantly larger than without the bi - stability jump . yet , the calculated value of about a factor 10 is not sufficient to explain the observed density contrast of a factor @xmath180 .",
    "so another mechanism is needed to enhance the density contrast even further .",
    "this is most likely the wind compression mechanism ( bjorkman &   cassinelli 1993 ; bjorkman 1998 ) .",
    "we have modified the line driven wind theory for rotating stars by including the effects of oblateness and gravity darkening as well as rotational terms in the equation of motion .",
    "we considered a sectorial wind , i.e. we neglected the effect of the motion of the wind towards the equator or towards the pole .",
    "this assumption is justified close to the stellar surface below the critical point of the momentum equation .",
    "this implies that our method will predict about the correct distibution of mass - loss rates from the star as a function of stellar latitude , but it may not be accurate enough to predict the velocity and density distribution further away from the star , if motions in the @xmath14 direction become important .",
    "the equation of motion was solved using an iterative numerical scheme , that includes the conservation of angular momentum and the correction factors to the radiative acceleration by lines and by the continuum , due to the non - spherical shape of the star and due to the latitude dependence of the radiative flux .",
    "this method was applied to study its possible effects on the formation of disks around fast rotating b[e ] supergiants .",
    "the models with constant force multiplier parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 show a decrease of _ both _ the mass loss rate and the terminal velocity from pole to equator .",
    "this is mainly due to two effects : the reduction of the escape velocity from pole to equator , resulting in a higher terminal velocity at the pole , and the reduction of the radiative flux from the pole to the equator due to gravity darkening , which results in a decrease in mass loss rate at the equator .    for a star with a fixed luminosity and a fixed polar radius ,",
    "the temperature at the pole increases and the temperature at the equator decreases with increasing rotation rate .",
    "the terminal velocity of the wind from the poles is almost independent of @xmath181 but at the equator @xmath6 decreases with increasing rotation rate . the mass - loss rate at the pole increases with increasing @xmath181 , due to the increase in @xmath170 at the poles , but the mass loss rate from the equator is almost independent of the rotation .",
    "the combination of these effects alone produce a density contrast between the polar and the equatorial wind of a factor @xmath182 , except for fast rotating stars with high luminosity ( in which case @xmath183 ) .",
    "our results agree quantitatively with those obtained by maeder ( @xcite ) for the latitudinal dependence of @xmath135 .",
    "our predictions of the global mass loss rates are also in general agreement with those of maeder for models with luminosities far from the eddington limit . for high luminosities",
    "we find a strong polar outflow , whereas maeder s models predict an enhanced equatorial outflow on the basis of the original cak scaling laws .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that we have included an improved description of the radiation pressure in a rotating star .",
    "the difference between the polar wind and the equatorial wind is strongly enhanced when the bi - stability of radiation driven winds between @xmath149 and 30  000 k is taken into account . in this case",
    "the force multipliers @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a rapidly rotating star change drastically with stellar latitude if the pole is hotter than 25  000 k and the equator is cooler . in   [ s_bs ] we have applied the newly calculated force multipliers from vink et al .",
    "( 1999 ) above and below the bi - stability jump to the models of rotating b[e ] supergiants .",
    "one might argue that it is not allowed to apply the force multipliers of ( bi - stable ) spherical wind models to aspherical winds of rotating stars .",
    "however , we have shown that a disk formed through bi - stability will be sufficiently thick ( typically about 30 degrees for a star with an effective temperature equal to about 25  000 ) to make these spherical models reasonable approximations for the conditions in the wind close to the star , where the mass loss rate is determined .",
    "we find that rotationally induced bi - stability models of b[e ] stars reach a density contrast of about a factor 10 between the dense equatorial wind and the less dense polar wind .",
    "this is less than the factor @xmath184 that is observed ( see e.g. bjorkman  @xcite ) .",
    "the extra density increase is most likely due to the wind compression .",
    "the gas that leaves the photosphere from a rotating wind , will follow an orbit in a tilted plane defined by the local rotation vector and the center of the star .",
    "if the rotational velocity is large or the wind velocity is small , this orbit will cross the equatorial plane where the streamlines of the wind from different stellar latitudes cross .",
    "the resulting shock will compress the gas into a thin outflowing disk with an opening angle of only a few degrees ( bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ; @xmath5 chapt 11 ) .",
    "we have not considered this wind compression in our model .",
    "however , it is likely to occur in rotationally induced bi - stable winds , because the wind velocity in the equatorial plane is about a factor three smaller than from the poles , thus facillitating the wind compression .",
    "owocki & cranmer ( 1994 ) have argued that the flow of the wind towards the equatorial plane , predicted in the wcd - theory , may be offset by a @xmath14-component of the line acceleration towards the polar regions .",
    "this `` disk inhibition '' mechanism operates in wind models with constant force multipliers @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is not clear that this mechanism is sufficiently strong to overcome the wind compression in the rib - model .",
    "this is because @xmath0 and @xmath1 change with latitude in the rib - model and there is a strong density gradient in the wind from the equator to the poles ( owocki et al .",
    "1998 , puls et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the combination of the rib and the wcd mechanism may offer the best possibility for explaining the disks of b[e]-supergiants . whether the compression is strong enough to explain the observed high density contrast between the polar and the equatorial wind , remains to be seen .",
    "it can be calculated by combining the solutions of the wind momentum equation of rotating oblate stars with gravity darkening ( derived in this paper ) , and the calculation of the resulting trajectories of the wind .",
    "the combination of the rotation induced bi - stability model and the wind compressed disk model is promising for explaining the disks of b[e ] stars because the rib - mechanism explains the increased mass loss and the small velocity from the equatorial regions and the wcd - mechanism explains the strong compression of the disk .",
