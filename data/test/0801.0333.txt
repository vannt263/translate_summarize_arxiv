    "it is now widely accepted that an early period of accelerated expansion of the universe , or inflation  @xcite , can resolve many cosmological problems such as horizon problem and can provide the desired initial conditions for the subsequent hot big bang evolution of the observed universe  @xcite .",
    "many observational facts such as the flatness of the universe and the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are natural consequences of inflation , and hence they strongly support the existence of such a period of acceleration in the very early universe . in particle physics point of view , inflation occurs when one or more scalar fields , the inflaton fields , dominate the energy density of the universe with their potential being overwhelming  @xcite .",
    "under such a condition , dubbed slow - roll condition , curvature perturbation @xmath4 is produced which is nearly scale invariant and is heavily constrained by the measurements of the anisotropies of the cmb and the observations of the large scale structure  @xcite , including the recent wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 5-year data set  @xcite .",
    "the slow - roll condition says that the inflaton potential should be very flat , i.e. the effective mass of the inflaton should be very small compared with the inflationary hubble parameter .",
    "this is , however , quite difficult to be achieved : for example , in supergravity , any generic scalar field is expected to have an effective mass of @xmath5  @xcite , which completely spoils the desired slow - roll condition .",
    "it is thus natural to consider some symmetry principle which protects the small inflaton mass from large radiative corrections or supergravity effects .",
    "shift symmetry , under which the field is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath6 with @xmath7 being an arbitrary constant , is one of such symmetries and the corresponding fields remain completely massless , i.e. their potential is exactly flat as long as shift symmetry is unbroken .",
    "when the symmetry is explicitly broken , they become pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) and the potential acquires a tilt depending on the symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 and is of the form @xmath9 \\ , .\\ ] ] the model of natural inflation  @xcite makes use of such a pngb with large @xmath8 , which renders the potential very flat .",
    "this largeness , however , requires @xmath10 and hence the valid region of successful natural inflation lies in the regime where we completely lose theoretical control .",
    "this has been regarded as a significant drawback of natural inflation .",
    "an idea to evade this problem was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scenario , called gauge inflation , the inflaton field is essentially coming from a part of the fifth component of the gauge boson in five dimensional bulk @xmath11 , by which the gauge invariant wilson line is defined as @xmath12 \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the gauge coupling constant . by the one - loop interactions with the charged particles , the potential of the canonically normalized field @xmath14 has basically the same form as eq .",
    "( [ naturalinf_v ] ) while @xmath15 has extra dimensional nature with @xmath16 being the size of the fifth dimension .",
    "hence the potential can be trusted even when @xmath8 is larger than @xmath17 in the perturbative regime of gauge interaction , @xmath18 . an interesting possibility to unify the grand unification theory ( gut ) and cosmic inflation in the framework of the gauge inflation",
    "was suggested in ref",
    ".  @xcite by one of the authors of the present paper : starting from the higher dimensional @xmath19 gut , the standard model is recovered by orbifold projection by @xmath20 and a massless scalar boson from the fifth component of the gauge boson is shown to play the role of the inflaton with a fully radiatively generated flat potential .    in this paper , we take a different approach . here",
    "we try to build the minimal model of gauge inflation using the simplest orbifold @xmath21 and the minimal non - abelian gauge group @xmath1 for the hidden sector .",
    "the obvious advantages of this approach is two - fold .",
    "first , by taking the hidden sector gauge interaction , the theory is less constrained than the visible sector gauge theory , e.g. gut  @xcite .",
    "this is important since the required coupling constant is typically very small , @xmath22 , so it is hard to reconcile this smallness with the coupling constant unification .",
    "second , the minimality can apply to the particle contents .",
    "different from the abelian case , the non - abelian gauge theory accommodates the gauge self - interactions by which the potential for the inflaton ( @xmath23 ) can be generated even without any additional charged matter fields .",
    "so the theory remains minimal in particle contents and its predictions are quite robust and free from parameters such as the masses and other quantum numbers of newly introduced matter fields . combining the minimal choice of the orbifold and the gauge group , no exotic particles appear in the theory .",
    "the model is clean .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give the detail of the higher dimensional gauge theory and outline the subsequent cosmological scenario .",
    "section  [ sec_cos ] is devoted to the cosmological evolution of the model and we analytically calculate the observable quantities produced during inflation and study their relations to the parameters of the model .",
    "we also address the issue of reheating and estimate the reheating temperature @xmath24 . in section  [ sec_con ]",
    "we then conclude .",
    "as we already emphasized in the previous section , we do not wish to introduce any exotic particle in the hidden sector .",
    "so non - abelian gauge symmetry is introduced and the minimal choice is @xmath1 .",
    "the spacetime is five dimensional where the fifth dimension is compactified by an orbifold @xmath21 is @xmath25 , the theory could be relevant for the higgs mechanism through the hosotani mechanism  @xcite . ] .",
    "the @xmath1 gauge theory on the orbifold is constructed by specifying two independent parity conditions at the two fixed points , @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the compactification radius , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 matrices satisfying @xmath33 .",
    "the translational transformation , @xmath34 , is generated by successive operation of the parity operators , @xmath35 .",
    "taking @xmath36 , at the classical level the gauge symmetry @xmath1 is reduced to @xmath37 by the orbifold projection . here",
    "we explicitly write down the parity assignment with @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath38 thus the zero modes are @xmath39 and @xmath40 which correspond to the @xmath41 gauge boson , i.e. mirror photon and the scalar field , respectively .",
    "the scalar field @xmath40 may develop a vacuum expectation value which could be put into the form of @xmath42 due to the remaining @xmath37 global symmetry .",
    "taking into account the effects from the gauge , ghost and the scalar self interaction , the one - loop effective potential for the field @xmath43 is induced as @xmath44 where the effective decay constant @xmath45 is introduced for canonical normalization of @xmath43 @xcite ( also see @xcite ) . here",
    "we can add a cosmological constant @xmath46 where @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 to solve the cosmological constant problem , which we do not attempt to address .",
    "thus , the radiatively generated inflaton potential is the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ 1looppotential ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) , i.e. @xmath49 \\ , .\\ ] ] in principle , we can further introduce additional matter field(s ) with charge @xmath50 in the hidden sector but for the simplicity and predictability we introduce none . in this sense ,",
    "our model , which may be responsible for the cosmological inflation , is the minimal model of hidden sector gauge theory on the simplest orbifold in five dimensions . after an inflationary epoch achieved while @xmath43 rolls down the effective potential given by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , it oscillates at the minimum and decays to reheat the universe .",
    "after then the standard hot big bang evolution follows . in the next section",
    "we calculate the observable quantities produced during inflation and confirm the relevance of our model .",
    "in this section , we study the detail of the cosmological evolution of the model described in the previous section . for analytic simplicity , we take as the leading approximation only the first term of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , i.e. @xmath51 \\ , .\\ ] ] as we will see in table  [ comparison ] , this approximation works fairly good .",
    "then the potential is identical to that of natural inflation , eq .",
    "( [ naturalinf_v ] ) , and the analytic calculations are straightforward especially when @xmath43 is close to the top  @xcite . here",
    "we just give the results of the observable quantities : the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath52 , the corresponding spectral index @xmath53 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath54 and the non - linear parameter @xmath55  @xcite . under the slow - roll approximation ,",

    "note that the running of @xmath53 , which in the slow - roll approximation is written as @xmath62 with @xmath63 being another slow - roll parameter , is second order in the slow - roll approximation and is negligibly small compared with the other quantities .",
