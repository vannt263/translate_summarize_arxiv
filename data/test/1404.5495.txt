    "since the seminal work of @xcite , it has been well - known that the motion of particles near a rotating black hole is strictly regular .",
    "this remarkable property is guaranteed by the full integrability of the system due to the existence of the fourth constant of motion , and it holds even in the case of an electrically - charged rotating black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "as soon as the black hole is embedded in an external magnetic field , chaotic dynamics may appear @xcite . while the electric charge of astronomical black holes is negligible , the role of the magnetic field is important ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the role of large - scale ( organized ) magnetic fields on the properties of motion near a rotating black hole .",
    "recent general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations @xcite suggest that accretion flows onto black holes are complemented by outflows emerging from accretion disks and tori , and , in some regions of the flow , produce large - scale ( organized ) magnetic loops in a self - consistent manner . the mechanism leading to the development of ordered bundles of the magnetic lines of force with a significant degree of long - range coherence appears to be highly relevant in the context of formation of jets and outflows from accreting black holes .",
    "simulations indicate that the role of black hole rotation is important and this supports the idea of blandford  znajek mechanism @xcite as the origin of acceleration and collimation in the vicinity of black holes @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the problem of particle acceleration in the context of oblique pulsar magnetospheres has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "we explore the effects of organized magnetic fields in a different context of particle motion near a weakly - magnetized black hole ( the magnetic field does not change the spacetime metric ) .",
    "we address the problem of regularity versus chaoticity of the resulting motion of electrically charged particles ( electrons and ions ) resulting from the mutual interplay of gravitational , electromagnetic , and gravito - magnetic effects of general relativity . as a matter of principle",
    ", we want to understand under what condition chaos emerges and drives the particle motion near magnetized black holes . to this end",
    "we assume that the magnetic field arises from currents flowing far out in the accretion disk .",
    "unlike most of previous analytical works , we do not impose axial symmetry ( the magnetic field can be inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole ) .",
    "the particle approximation allows us to concentrate our attention on purely general - relativistic effects of the curved electro - vacuum spacetime while neglecting collective interactions and shocks in the plasma @xcite .",
    "the adopted approximation is thus relevant to situations when the grmhd conditions are not satisfied : in our case , particle mean free path @xmath0 is assumed to be very long ( exceeding the gravitational radius of the black hole , @xmath1 ) while , simultaneously , the gravitational field is very strong ( curvature radius evaluated from the riemann curvature tensor @xmath2 .",

    "this work represents a natural extension of our previous studies @xcite in which we considered dynamic properties of charged matter orbiting in the vicinity of massive objects .",
    "our primary concern was to identify and investigate regions of a stable , off - equatorial motion .",
    "trajectories of ionized particles confined to such regions constitute a basic _ non - interacting test particle _ approximation of astrophysical coronae formed by diluted plasma above and below the accretion disk of accreting systems .",
    "several models have been considered so far . as a first step",
    ", the existence of off - equatorial orbits was investigated in the spacetime described by the exact kerr  newman solution , i.e. , the case of a rotating electrically charged black hole .",
    "considering only the astrophysically - relevant region above the outer horizon of the black hole , it was found that there are no stable circular orbits ( _ halo orbits _ ) outside the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "therefore , we altered our model , namely , we employed test field solutions describing large - scale , ordered magnetic fields ( asymptotically uniform or dipole type ) in which the compact object is immersed . in particular , we investigated a system consisting of schwarzschild black hole with a rotating magnetic dipole field , and the case of the kerr black hole in an asymptotically - uniform magnetic field , which both appeared to host non - equatorial confinements of charged particles @xcite . since both of these systems were found to be non - integrable , in which case the chaotic dynamics emerges , we subsequently focused on the dynamic properties of these orbits , trying to identify which parameters of the system trigger chaos .",
    "we found that within the off - equatorial lobes , the dynamics are mostly regular and chaos typically appears only when the energy of the particle is sufficiently increased to the level that corresponds to cross - equatorial confinements @xcite .",
    "more recently , a static model of an exact einstein ",
    "maxwell spacetime was considered in this context @xcite .",
    "namely , the dynamics of charged matter in off - equatorial wells above the massive magnetic dipole described by bonnor s exact solution @xcite was investigated .",
    "in such a case , the electromagnetic field affects the geometry of the spacetime and as a particular consequence of this influence , we found that the system allows off - equatorial orbits even for neutral test particles . the interplay between the chaotic and ordered motion of test particles in the exactly - given static field of a massive source encircled by a disk or",
    "a ring was also recently investigated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we intend to focus on a more realistic model in which the rotation of the central object is included . on the other hand",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the test field approximation in which the electromagnetic field affects charged particles , but it does not modify the metric .    in this contribution",
    "we plan to investigate the dynamical properties of charged particles in the generalized model consisting of the rotating kerr black hole in the asymptotically - uniform magnetic field that is inclined with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "a corresponding test field solution was given by @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , however , the particle motion in this setup has not yet been inspected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "we present formal description of the model and explicitly specify the electromagnetic four - potential @xmath5 .",
    "then we review the hamiltonian formalism which is employed to derive equations of motion .",
    "application of the method of the maximal lyapunov exponent as an indicator of chaos is also briefly discussed .",
    "analysis of the motion of particles affected by the inclination of the magnetic field is presented in section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "three distinct classes of orbits are treated separately in corresponding subsections .",
    "possible ways for observational verification are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",

    "values of basic constants ( gravitational constant @xmath9 , speed of light @xmath10 , boltzmann constant @xmath11 , and coulomb constant @xmath12 ) thus equal unity @xmath13 .",
    "test field solution corresponding to the aligned magnetic field ( of the asymptotic strength @xmath14 ) was derived by @xcite .",
    "this solution was later generalized by @xcite to describe the field which is arbitrarily inclined with respect to the rotation axis ( specified by two independent components @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",

    "lindquist coordinates as follows : @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the outer and the inner horizon , respectively .",
    "we notice that @xmath22 .",
    "we have previously investigated the structure of the electromagnetic field emerging in a more general case of the kerr black hole immersed in the asymptotically - uniform magnetic field ( 1 ) which is inclined with respect to the rotation axis and ( 2 ) in which the black hole is drifting with the constant velocity and in the arbitrary direction @xcite .",
    "we found complex structures of both the magnetic and the electric field lines in this model .",
    "in particular , we observed that due to combined effects of the translational motion and the frame dragging ( caused by the black hole s rotation ) , the null points of magnetic field may arise .",
    "these may be highly relevant for the acceleration processes of ionized matter in the vicinity of an accreting object .",
    "nevertheless , the motion of charged particles exposed to such a field has not been inspected in the aforementioned studies and within this paper we consider the inclination of the magnetic field but not the translational motion of the black hole .      employing the hamiltonian formalism",
    ", we first construct the super - hamiltonian @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the charge of the test particle ( of rest mass @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the generalized ( canonical ) momentum , @xmath28 is the metric tensor , and @xmath17 denotes the vector potential of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the latter is related to the electromagnetic tensor @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "hamilton s equations of motion are given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the affine parameter ( dimensionless in geometrized units ) , @xmath33 denotes the proper time , and @xmath34 is the standard kinematical four - momentum for which the first equation reads @xmath35 , and thus the conserved value of super - hamiltonian is equal to @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the system is stationary since the hamiltonian is independent on the coordinate time @xmath37 .",
    "its conjugate momentum @xmath38 is therefore integral of motion .",
    "namely , it expresses ( negatively taken ) the energy of the test particle @xmath39 .",
    "the mass of the black hole @xmath40 is used to scale all quantities , which is formally equivalent to setting @xmath41 in the equations .",
    "we also switch to specific quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 when describing the test particle . from the above equations , we conclude that independent parameters of the investigated system are thus @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . indeed",
    ", the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 only appear in the product with the particle s charge in the equations of motion ( [ hameq ] ) since the electromagnetic field is treated in the test field approximation .",
    "besides that , particular trajectory is further specified by its initial position in the phase space @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 whose values are , however , bound by the normalization condition @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we do not set all the components arbitrarily and choose to compute the value @xmath52 using the normalization of the four - momentum and its remaining components instead .",
    "maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 is commonly used as a basic quantitative indicator of chaotic dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its value directly captures the tendency of nearby orbits to diverge as the system evolves . in other words",
    ", it allows us to express how sensitive the given orbit is on the initial condition whilst the high ( exponential ) sensitivity is a defining property of chaos . the exponent @xmath55 is defined as follows is defined as an asymptotic measure ( [ mle ] ) . in the numerical application",
    "we actually compute the quantity usually denoted as _ finite time lyapunov exponent _ , which depends on the integration variable , instead of the limit .",
    "however , in this text we disregard such distinctions and use the term lyapunov exponent for both quantities as it can not cause any confusion within the scope of the paper . ]",
    "@xmath56    where we choose to use the standard @xmath57 ( euclidean ) norm to measure the length of the deviation vector in the phase space @xmath58 . in this context , we have also experimented with norms reflecting the curvature of the spacetime , however , it appeared that for a given application the choice of the norm is not crucial @xcite .",
    "although lyapunov exponents within the relativistic framework are generally not invariant under coordinate transformations @xcite , signs of the exponents are preserved @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distinction between chaotic and regular orbits may be drawn invariantly .",
    "the usual method of determining the evolution of the deviation @xmath59 consists in solving variational equations which restricts us to the linear term in a corresponding taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "one can therefore express the variational equations in the following matrix form with column vector @xmath60 and its derivative @xmath61 with respect to the affine parameter @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hessian matrix composed of second derivatives of the super - hamiltonian @xmath23 with respect to phase space variables and @xmath65 is constant matrix with following block form : @xmath66 , in which @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote @xmath69-dimensional identity and zero matrices , respectively . in our case @xmath70 .",
    "detailed derivations of variational equations ( [ vareq ] ) and their properties are given in a recent review on lyapunov exponents by @xcite .",
    "matrix @xmath64 is evaluated along the orbit and explicitly depends on the current position in the phase space ; therefore it is necessary to integrate variational equations simultaneously with corresponding equations of motion ( [ hameq ] ) .",
    "we set the initial deviation as follows @xmath71 .",
    "the theory of lyapunov spectra guarantees that setting random initial deviation results in the computation of the maximal exponent @xmath55 with a probability of one and the set of initial deviations for which we would obtain different lyapunov exponents has zero measure @xcite .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 corresponds to the most unstable direction in the phase space , however , exponents related to the complementary phase space directions can also be determined to reveal the whole lyapunov spectrum .",
    "general properties of lyapunov exponents imply that an autonomous hamiltonian system of three degrees of freedom has four non - zero exponents out of which , however , only two are independent as they always appear in pairs of opposite signs but equal absolute values @xcite .",
    "the computation of the whole spectrum of lyapunov exponents can be performed using , e.g. , the standard method developed by @xcite . although knowing the whole spectrum provides additional information about a given orbit , for the purpose of detecting chaotic dynamics it is sufficient enough to only compute the maximal exponent . for chaotic orbits ,",
    "exponent @xmath55 attains a positive value , while for regular trajectories it tends to zero as @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , in the logarithmic plot @xmath73 , the regular trajectory appears as a linearly - decreasing function while the chaotic orbit , sooner or later , leaves the trend of linear decreasing and converges to the positive value .",
    "the lyapunov time @xmath74 may thus be used to estimate the time after which the chaoticity of a given orbit manifests . as given by equation ( [ mle ] ) . in practical numerical applications",
    "we evaluate @xmath75 of a chaotic orbit for such a value of @xmath62 for which @xmath55 appears to attain its limit , i.e. it does not evolve anymore . ] in particular , our operational criterion for _ full _ or _ saturated _ chaos will be the approximate relation @xmath76 , assuring that the trajectory exhibits chaotic properties on the time scale of its azimuthal period or even faster",
    ".    however , the convergence of @xmath55 may become very slow , and in some cases extremely long integration times are needed to reveal the chaotic nature of the trajectory .",
    "for example , some chaotic orbits get stuck in close vicinity of a regular orbit for a long time before they escape to the larger chaotic domain in the phase space ( so called  stickiness effect   see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the computation of lyapunov exponents may also be obstructed by numerical errors , especially when the long integration is required , the proper choice of the integrator becomes crucial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , if one proceeds with caution , the method usually gives reliable results .",
    "in general , when performing the long - term integration of the hamiltonian system , the method of choice would be a symplectic integrator ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it is not possible to use a symplectic scheme for the simultaneous integration of the variational equations , and therefore we have to apply some non - symplectic method .",
    "namely , we employ the matlab integrator ode87 which is an explicit 7th8th order runge ",
    "kutta solver based on the dorman  prince formulas .",
    "the precision of this integrator with adaptive step - size is controlled by setting the relative tolerance ( @xmath77 ) , which specifies the highest allowed relative error in a single integration step .",
    "we were able to run our integrations with @xmath78 . during each integration we checked for the cumulative error ( causing artificial excitation or damping of the system ) by expressing the relative change of energy of the particle which maximally reached @xmath79 for the longest runs",
    "common characteristics of previously investigated models are stationarity and axial symmetry .",
    "such a system has two degrees of freedom in the four - dimensional spacetime . considering the oblique magnetic field",
    ", however , we break the axisymmetry and the resulting system has three degrees of freedom , which has several important implications regarding the techniques we can apply for the analysis . first of all , we can no longer use the method of effective potential to localize the regions of bound orbits and , in particular , to find the stable , circular , off - equatorial orbits corresponding to the local minima of the potential ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) . besides that , the method of poincar surfaces of section , which is commonly used to visualize the trajectories and distinguish between regular and chaotic dynamics in systems of two degrees of freedom , fails to deliver unambiguous results in this case .",
    "we will explore the behavior of the maximal lyapunov characteristic exponent @xmath55 as a primary indicator of chaotic dynamics instead .",
    "inapplicability of the effective potential method leaves us without the usual tool for a systematical search for stable orbits throughout the configuration space and parameter space . in this place , we take advantage of our former study of axisymmetric versions of given systems @xcite and use the particular , previously - investigated , confinements of particles in the system with aligned magnetic fields as the starting point of our current analysis .",
    "we will gradually incline the originally - aligned field and observe its impact upon the dynamics of particles .",
    "such an approach has obvious limitations .",
    "we can not set arbitrary inclination @xmath80 as we need to maintain the confinement of stable orbits whose presence at a given location non - trivially depends on its value .",
    "actually , we shall fix all other parameters and increase the inclination of the field as long as we find the confinement of stable orbits . after reaching the critical inclination angle",
    ", the confinement disintegrates allowing the particles to escape to infinity or to fall onto the horizon .",
    "we are , however , only interested in the family of bound orbits .    in the following",
    "we shall separately treat three distinct classes of orbits which we detected in the aligned field considering both charged and neutral black holes .",
    "namely , in section  [ regoff ] we shall explore the impact of inclination of the field upon the regular orbits in off - equatorial confinement . in section  [ chaoscross ]",
    ", we consider chaotic orbits in the cross - equatorial lobe and in section  [ regeq ] , the class of regular , equatorial trajectories is investigated .",
    "the distinction between equatorial and cross - equatorial orbits is based upon the different topology of effective potential defining the confinement . in the case of equatorial orbits ,",
    "the underlying potential has a local minimum in the equatorial plane , while the cross - equatorial lobe is defined by the pair of symmetric off - equatorial minima separated by the saddle point residing in the equatorial plane .",
    "according to the results of our previous analysis , the latter configuration generally appears to host mainly chaotic orbits while the dynamics in the equatorial wells remains predominantly regular as long as the energy is raised only _ slightly _ above the level of the corresponding potential minimum .",
    "as we have already mentioned , we choose examples of both charged and neutral black holes . in general , the presence or absence of test charge @xmath16 ( generating kerr  newman test field which we superpose to the magnetic field ",
    "see equations ( [ empot1])-([empot4 ] ) ) does not seem to act as the factor systematically shifting the dynamics to become more or less chaotic . this is not surprising if we recall that the kerr  newman field alone does not represent a non - integrable perturbation for charged particles , as it admits the fourth integral of motion  carter s constant @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "although it evidently affects the dynamics of ionized particles ( e.g. , changes the location and shape of the particle confinements ) it does not act as a trigger for chaos .",
    "considering the aligned magnetic field in @xcite , we classified off - equatorial lobes according to the behavior of effective potential in the vicinity of its off - equatorial minima into four distinct classes ia  id ( see fig .",
    "[ wald_abcd ] ) . closed lobes define regions of possible confinement of particles , whereas the lobes extending down to the horizon allow particles to be accreted onto the black hole ( types ia  c ) . on the other hand , regions extending to large distance",
    "represent the case when particles can move far out ( e.g. , along the axis in type i d ) .",
    "curves of constant energy suggest a different destiny of a particle on the off - equatorial circular orbit when its energy increases above the level of corresponding potential minimum . in type ia the symmetric off - equatorial minima first merge via equatorial saddle point , allowing stable cross - equatorial motion .",
    "increasing its energy further , the particle would reach another saddle point in the equatorial plane which allows it to fall freely onto the horizon .",
    "the class ib does not permit any cross - equatorial motion  off - equatorial confinements connect to the horizon directly when the energy increases sufficiently .",
    "topology of type ic allows merging of off - equatorial lobes , however , at a merging point , these are already opened toward the horizon and the motion in the cross - equatorial confinement is thus never stable .",
    "type i d allows stable cross - equatorial motion . as the energy increases sufficiently the isopotential curve opens and particles may escape to infinity ( unlike the case of ia when they felt onto horizon instead ) .    only two cases ( namely types ia and i d ) exhibit the transition from the bound off - equatorial motion to the bound cross - equatorial motion when",
    "the energy is increased .",
    "remaining types ib and ic do not allow closed cross - equatorial structures . in the following",
    "we analyze the impact of the inclination of the magnetic field on the originally regular off - equatorial orbit of type i d .",
    "in particular , to distinctly illustrate its influence we depart from the very same configuration as we used in @xcite .",
    "namely , we explored the orbit with parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and with the initial condition : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 we observed regular off - equatorial motion while with @xmath91 the motion was cross - equatorial and chaotic .",
    "first we analyze the former case while the latter is inspected in section  [ chaoscross ] .    gradually increasing the inclination @xmath80 and checking",
    "if the motion remains allowed and the orbit is still bound , we conclude that up to @xmath92 the allowed region remains closed , for values up to @xmath93 , it still exists as an open region allowing the particle to escape while even higher values forbid the motion for given parameters . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ off_reg_3d ] we illustrate two examples of analyzed trajectories in the three - dimensional view .",
    "most importantly , it shows that the inclination of the field extends the allowed region and converts the off - equatorial orbit into cross - equatorial in this case .",
    "moreover , it suggests that the originally regular trajectory turns chaotic , which we confirm by means of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ off_reg_3d ] .    for very small inclinations up to @xmath94 ,",
    "the trajectory remains regular and @xmath55 tends to zero limit ( @xmath95 decreases linearly as a function of @xmath96 ) . in particular , for the case of @xmath97 , we have checked this trend by integrating up to @xmath98 .",
    "however , setting @xmath99 the exponent @xmath55 attains a positive value which marks the onset of chaos .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath55 of the given orbit further rises as the inclination increases . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the trajectory becomes cross - equatorial and @xmath55 almost saturates as it does not significantly rise when the field is further inclined .",
    "the trajectory is now _ fully chaotic _ as its lyapunov time roughly equals the orbital period @xmath101 ( numerically averaged along the actual orbit  see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "values @xmath102 correspond to the opened allowed region and the particle typically escapes before @xmath103 .    the analyzed example reveals the typical behavior of the originally regular off - equatorial orbits perturbed by inclining the magnetic field .",
    "most importantly , it shows that the inclination of the field induces continuous transition to chaos as measured by means of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 .",
    "here we inspect the impact of the inclination on the cross - equatorial orbit which is already chaotic in the aligned field .",
    "we choose to analyze the example analogical to the previous case of the off - equatorial orbit .",
    "namely , we start with the trajectory which has a higher energy @xmath91 while all other parameters and initial conditions remain fixed at values specified above . in the left panel of fig",
    ".  [ ekv_chaos_3d ] , we compare the three - dimensional views of two typical chaotic orbits : the original aligned trajectory ( red ) and an inclined trajectory with @xmath104 ( blue ) .",
    "higher inclinations are not permitted for given setup .",
    "inclined field lines are traced by the trajectory which clearly shows the direction of the field . however , besides the inclination of the trajectory there is no apparent qualitative difference between compared orbits in fig .",
    "[ ekv_chaos_3d ] .    quantitative comparison in terms of the lyapunov exponent @xmath55 confirms that , in this case , the inclination of the magnetic field does not significantly change the dynamics ( right panel of fig .",

    "we observe that unlike the previous case of off - equatorial regular orbits , here the asymptotic values of @xmath55 are not stratified with respect to the inclination angle .",
    "a higher inclination angle does not necessarily correspond to a higher maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 . changing the inclination between @xmath105 and @xmath106 results in comparable asymptotic values of @xmath55 .",

    "the given example of the originally regular equatorial orbit affected by inclining the magnetic field , illustrated high sensitivity of regular dynamics upon the axial symmetry of the system . in this case , breaking the symmetry inevitably brings chaotic features to the system regardless the value of the inclination .        in fig .",

    "the scenario investigated within this paper is idealized and its direct applicability for interpretation of observed astrophysical phenomena is limited .",
    "however , the significance of our model lies in its ability to demonstrate the effect of combined magnetic and strong gravitational fields onto the dynamics of charged matter in a very clear form since the matter is treated as collisionless and thus its motion is governed solely by external fields . under such circumstances we raised the fundamental question whether a given combination of fields typically leads to chaotic or regular dynamics of orbiting particles .    in the context of this analysis",
    "another natural question arises  whether it is possible to observationally distinguish imprints of ordered or chaotic dynamics occurring in the investigated system . in general , the link between chaos on a microscopic scale and the macroscopic behavior of matter has not yet been fully understood and it represents an open problem of statistical mechanics . while , in some systems , the relation of transport coefficients ( e.g. , viscosity , thermal , or electric conductivity , etc . ) to lyapunov exponents is observed , there are also non - chaotic systems that show transport phenomena and thus suggest that chaos might not be necessary for the robust statistical behaviors ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , we are in a slightly different situation as we do not build a statistical ensemble of particles to derive its macroscopic properties in the framework of kinetic theory .",
    "as we rather consider a set of non - interacting particles , can we expect them to give characteristic imprints of their dynamic regime on the generated radiation ?",
    "we believe that the answer is , at least in principle , positive .",
    "frequency analysis of bound trajectories shows a clear difference between order and chaos @xcite .",
    "while regular trajectories have discrete power spectra with prominent lines at their fundamental frequencies , the chaotic ones instead show continuous spectra . in the case of charged particles",
    "which radiate when accelerated , such distinction in the spectra of dynamic frequencies inevitably translates into a frequency composition of generated electromagnetic signals . determining the actual form of resulting electromagnetic spectra would , however , require a detailed analysis , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also note that the general problem of detecting chaos and quasiperiodicity in experimental data with noise has been studied thoroughly ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a number of relevant methods have been developed over the last decades . not listing all standard techniques ,",
    "we only mention a more recent method of recurrence analysis @xcite , which appears very useful for this task .",
    "the crucial question remains : whether the electromagnetic signal generated by our system is strong enough to deliver characteristic imprints of order and chaos to the observer . in appendix  [ appb ]",
    "we thus calculate the power @xmath121 of synchrotron radiation generated by charged particles orbiting in the confinements discussed above .",
    "the total power of this radiation as given by equation ( [ powertot ] ) is negligible . the obvious way to substantially enhance",
    "the power output is to accelerate the particles to ultrarelativistic velocities since @xmath121 scales with lorentz factor @xmath122 as @xmath123 . in our model , however , the velocity ( [ linspeed ] ) is not a free parameter and it seems that ultrarelativistic velocities are beyond its scope . estimating the bremsstrahlung resulting from coulomb collisions ( free  free radiation ) by equation ( [ brem ] )",
    ", we find this radiative process to be substantially more efficient in given circumstances .",
    "however , unlike synchrotron radiation , we do not expect the bremsstrahlung to encode imprints of dynamic regime of colliding particles in its spectrum .",
    "we have shown that a charged matter in densities consistent with our collisionless description does not emit a significant amount of synchrotron radiation in which we could distinguish imprints of regular or chaotic dynamic regime of emitting particles .",
    "the mechanism of inverse compton scattering of thermal photons emitted from the accretion disk on electrons trapped in the confinements discussed within this paper may be more effective in delivering observational imprints in detectable signals ( ongoing work ) .",
    "the main motivation of our current analysis was to study the chaoticity in the dynamics of charged matter in accreting black hole systems as a fundamental theoretical aspect of its physics .",
    "regularity is a remarkable property of motion around black holes .",
    "we addressed the question of transition from regular to chaotic dynamics by including the effect of magnetic field , and we studied the importance of misalignment between the direction of the magnetic field and the spin of the black hole .    in this paper we investigated some aspects of dynamics in the test particle model of the black hole magnetosphere . in particular , we considered a system consisting of a rotating black hole embedded in the large - scale ordered magnetic field . in our previous studies",
    "@xcite we found that , in the special case of an aligned field ( i.e. , the magnetic field was symmetric with respect to the rotation axis ) , the motion of matter in off - equatorial confinements was typically regular .",
    "the chaotic dynamics usually appeared for cross - equatorial orbits .",
    "considering the equatorial potential wells instead , we observed the dominance of regular dynamics for energies in a certain limited range , followed by a continuous transition to the mostly - chaotic regime when the energy was gradually increased above this range .",
    "here we generalized our model by considering oblique magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , we investigated the impact of the inclination upon the dynamics of charged matter orbiting around a black hole in three distinct types of confinements , namely in off - equatorial , cross - equatorial , and equatorial lobes . using the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 as a basic indicator of chaotic dynamics , we found that regular orbits are , in general , highly sensitive to the perfect alignment of the field .",
    "the inclination of @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) was typically sufficient to perturb the regular dynamics and introduce prominent chaotic features which we illustrated in several representative examples .",
    "in particular , we found that in the case of originally regular , off - equatorial , motion the system remains regular only for very small inclinations ( up to @xmath126 in analyzed example ) and with increasing inclination it quickly shifts to the chaotic regime . considering the class of regular equatorial orbits instead , we observed that these did not oppose the perturbation at all as they became chaotic for inclinations as low as @xmath127 .",
    "also in this case the system undergoes gradual transition to full chaos as the inclination increases . on the other hand ,",
    "if the original trajectory is already fully chaotic in the aligned configuration , the further perturbation to the system by inclining the field does not significantly affect the dynamics .",
    "the trajectory as a whole inclines along the field ( see fig .",
    "[ ekv_chaos_3d ] ) , however , the chaoticity as measured by the lyapunov exponent @xmath55 does not increase further .",
    "we conclude that within the given model the stability of the regular motion of charged particles depends critically on the the perfect alignment of the large - scale magnetic field with the rotation axis of the black hole . once the field is slightly inclined and the symmetry of the system breaks , the chaotic regime dominates the dynamics .",

    "in the classical mechanics , the notion of the effective potential is usually introduced when dealing with the central force problem which concerns the motion of the particle of negligible mass ( _ test particle _ ) which is attracted or repelled by a static massive center .",

    "a prominent instance of such a setup in which the central force is represented by the gravitational attraction is a kepler problem ( and a related gravitational two - body problem which can be reformulated as two one - body problems , one trivial and the other of the kepler type ) .",
    "effective potential @xmath128 is then given as a sum of the gravitational potential and the centrifugal term related to the angular momentum @xmath129 of the orbiting body .",
    "analysis of the effective potential provides valuable overall information about the dynamics without needing the actual integration of particular trajectories .",
    "its significance arises from the defining relation @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the classical total energy of the particle and @xmath132 represents its kinetic part which comprises only the radial term @xmath133 in this case since @xmath134 is expressed in terms of @xmath129 .",
