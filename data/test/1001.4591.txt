    "the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules on metal surfaces are of great importance to the subsequent oxidation reactions and to the formation of metal oxides @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for the formation of thin oxide films that have been widely used as catalysts , sensors , dielectrics , and corrosion inhibitors @xcite .",
    "thus vast studies have been carried out on the o@xmath0 adsorption and dissociation on metal surfaces . during these studies ,",
    "the theoretical _ ab initio _ modeling based on the adiabatic approximation has been proved successful over a wide range for studying the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 on transition metal surfaces . by calculating the adiabatic potential energy surface ( pes )",
    ", it has been found that o@xmath1 molecules will spontaneously dissociate while adsorbing at reactive transition metal surfaces like iron ( fe ) @xcite . for noble transition metals like gold ( au ) @xcite , silver ( ag ) @xcite , copper ( cu ) @xcite , platinum ( pt ) @xcite and nickel ( ni ) @xcite , the adsorption of o@xmath1 turns out to depend on the ambient temperature , and both atomic and molecular adsorptions have been observed .",
    "remarkably , in all above transition metal systems , the concept of adiabatic calculation works very well in explaining and predicting a large amount of physical / chemical phenomena during dissociation process of o@xmath1 .",
    "when the attention is focused on the nontransition metals with only @xmath2 valence electrons , an uncomfortable gap opens between _ ab initio _ prediction and experimental observation .",
    "the most notable is the long - term enigma of low initial sticking probability of thermal o@xmath1 molecules at al(111 ) , which has been measured by many independent experiments @xcite but can not be reproduced by adiabatic state - of - the - art density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the central problem is that the adiabatic dft calculations were unable to find any sizeable barriers on the adiabatic pes , which has led to speculations that nonadiabatic effects may play an important role in the oxygen dissociation process at the al(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "recently , we present a comparative study on the electronic structure of an o@xmath0 molecule in close to the be(0001 ) , mg(0001 ) and al(111 ) surfaces , and find that the triplet state of o@xmath0 is influenced by the mg(0001 ) and al(111 ) surfaces , but not by the be(0001 ) surface @xcite . thus we prove that the adiabatic dft calculations are still reliable to study the o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system , and find out sizable dissociation energy barriers for o@xmath0 molecules on the be(0001 ) surface @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the systematical results on the o@xmath0 dissociation on transition metal surfaces , there are still no criteria to judge whether an energy barrier is needed or whether a precursor molecular - adsorption state exists for the o@xmath0 dissociation on @xmath2 metal surfaces . motivated by these backgrounds , in this paper we investigate the dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules on another @xmath2 metal surface , lead ( pb ) .",
    "we find that the adiabatic dft calculation also leads to reliable results for the o@xmath0/pb(111 ) system .",
    "another motive for us to study the o@xmath0 dissociation on the pb(111 ) surface is that atomically uniform pb films with thickness from several to tens of monolayers ( mls ) have been successfully fabricated on both metal and semiconductor substrates @xcite , which can serve as an ideal prototype for experimental researchers to investigate the surface oxidation of pb .",
    "however , it is believed that for very thin metal films , the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules becomes more complex because of the two boundaries . according to the `` particle - in - a - box '' model ,",
    "electrons confined in a uniform film are quantized into discrete energy levels along the film - normal direction , forming the so - called quantum well states . because the electron fermi wavelength of pb is nearly 4 times the lattice spacing along the [ 111 ] direction @xcite , many properties like thermal stability , surface energy , and work function of the pb films oscillate with thickness with a quasibilayer period @xcite . recently",
    ", a unique two - step method has been brought out to efficiently oxidize the the pb(111 ) surface @xcite . during this special oxidation process",
    ", o@xmath0 molecules are firstly introduced at a low temperature and adsorb in a precursor state , then the pb(111 ) surface is oxidized by a subsequently annealing to room temperature @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , both the oxygen coverage at low temperature and oxide coverage after annealing are found to be modulated by the quantum size effect ( qse ) of ultrathin pb(111 ) films @xcite .",
    "these studies together with other investigations @xcite clearly prove the modulation of surface oxidation by qse .",
    "to understand the complicated experimental observations , the systematical investigations on the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules on ultrathin pb(111 ) films are needed .    in our previous work",
    ", we have already studied the adsorption properties for both molecular o@xmath0 and atomic o on different pb(111 ) films @xcite .",
    "it is found that o@xmath0 molecules will not spontaneously dissociate on pb(111 ) films , and a precursor molecular adsorption state exists @xcite . here in this work ,",
    "we further analyze the electronic interactions for the adsorption of o@xmath0 , investigate the dissociation process for o@xmath0 , and study the qse on the dissociation energy barriers .",
    "the rest of the paper organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give details of the first - principles total energy calculations , which is followed in sec .",
    "iii by our analysis for the adsorption state of o@xmath0 on the pb(111 ) surface . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the o@xmath0 dissociation on pb(111 ) films , and discuss the qse on the corresponding energy barriers . and finally in sec .",
    "vi , we give our conclusions .",
    "the dft total energy calculations are carried out using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package @xcite . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew _ et al_. @xcite and the projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) potentials",
    "@xcite are employed to describe the exchange - correlation energy and the electron - ion interaction , respectively . the so - called `` repeated slab '' geometries @xcite are employed to model the clean pb(111 ) films ranging from 4 to 8 monolayers ( ml ) .",
    "a vacuum layer of 20    is adopted to separate the pb(111 ) slabs in two adjacent cells , which is found to be sufficiently convergent from our test calculations .",
    "the o@xmath0 was placed on one side of the slab , namely on the top surface , whereas the bottom layer was fixed .",
    "all other pb layers as well as the oxygen atoms are free to relax until the forces on them are less than 0.02 ev /  . the plane - wave energy cutoff is set to 400 ev .",
    "a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.1 ev is chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around @xmath3 by a finite-@xmath4 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath5 k. integration over the brillouin zone is done using the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite with @xmath6 grid points .",
    "the calculated lattice constant of bulk pb is 5.03  , in good agreement with the experimental value of 4.95    @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of spin - polarized o@xmath1 is calculated to be @xmath7=5.78 ev per atom and the o - o bond length is about 1.235  .",
    "these results are typical for well - converged dft - gga calculations .",
    "compared to the experimental @xcite values of 5.12 ev and 1.21    for o binding energy and bonding length , the usual dft - gga result always introduces an overestimation , which reflects the theoretical deficiency for describing the local orbitals of the oxygen .",
    "we will consider this overbinding of o@xmath1 when drawing any conclusion that may be affected by its explicit value .",
    "the geometries of ultrathin pb(111 ) films are firstly relaxed before our study for the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules .",
    "it is found that the surface relaxations display well - defined qse @xcite . generally speaking , atoms at the outmost layer tend to relax inward . in contrast , atoms at the second layer tend to relax outward . and both the contraction for the first interlayer and the expansion for the second interlayer exhibit oscillations of bilayer period , reflecting the effect of the quantum well states @xcite .",
    "we then check the reliability of our adiabatic calculations .",
    "the main reason for the wrong conclusions lead by adiabatic first - principles calculations on the adsorption of o@xmath0 on @xmath2-metals lies in that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) state of o@xmath0 is always aligned with the fermi level at any distance between the molecule and metal surfaces such as al(111 ) , allowing a partial filling of the empty molecular orbital @xcite . due to this unphysical ( metal - molecule or intramolecule ) charge transfer , the adsorption of o@xmath0 on the al(111 ) surface is calculated to be dissociative without any energy barriers , which contradicts with the experimental observations of low initial sticking probability at low temperatures @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we have shown that the unphysical partial filling of the lumo does not happen during the adsorption of o@xmath0 on the be(0001 ) surface , and thus we obtained sizeable energy barriers for the dissociation of o@xmath0 . here for the o@xmath0/pb(111 ) system , molecular adsorption precursor states exist , so we can not judge the reliability of our calculations by whether a sizable energy barrier exists or not .",
    "we calculate and show in fig .",
    "1(a ) the electronic density of states ( dos ) of an o@xmath0 molecule in close to a 5 ml pb(111 ) film . in comparison with the dos of o@xmath0 in close to the mg(0001 ) and",
    "al(111 ) surfaces depicted in figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) , we find that the triplet ground state of the o@xmath0 molecule is not influenced at all in close to the pb(111 ) film , but totally disturbed by the mg(0001 ) and al(111 ) surfaces due to the unphysical charge transfers .",
    "therefore , we are sure that the adiabatic dft calculations will not lead to unphysical conclusions for the o@xmath0/pb(111 ) system , as well as for the o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system .    to facilitate our discussions , we give some notations at first .",
    "formally , there are four high - symmetry sites on the pb(111 ) surface , respectively the top ( t ) , bridge ( b ) , hcp ( hh ) , and fcc ( fh ) hollow sites .",
    "our previous study has already shown that the high - symmetry sites play crucial roles in the adsorption o@xmath0 molecules on pb(111 ) films @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not consider other surface sites any more . at each surface site",
    ", an o@xmath0 molecule has three different high - symmetry orientations , respectively along the x ( i.e. , [ 0@xmath81 ] ) , y ( i.e. , [ @xmath911 ] ) , and z ( i.e. , [ 111 ] ) directions .",
    "therefore , we will use t-@xmath10 , b-@xmath10 , hh-@xmath10 , and fh-@xmath10 to respectively represent the 12 high symmetry adsorption channels for o@xmath0 .",
    "after geometry optimizations by initially setting the o@xmath0 molecule at 4.0    along each adsorption channel , we have got 6 molecular adsorption states for o@xmath0 @xcite . by using numbers 1 , 2 , and 3 to represent the o@xmath0 orientation along the x , y , and z directions , we name the six adsorption states respectively as hh1 , hh2 , hh3 , fh1 , fh2 , and fh3 .",
    "the atomic geometries for the hh1 , hh2 and hh3 states are listed in figs .",
    "2(b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "the geometries for the fh1 , fh2 and fh3 states are very similar to hh1 , hh2 and hh3 states , with the adsorbed oxygen atoms at fcc hollow sites instead of hcp hollow sites . among the six precursor states ,",
    "hh1 and hh2 are the most stable and two nearly degenerate states . in our previous work ,",
    "we have already discussed in detail the interactions between oxygen and pb for the hh1 state @xcite .",
    "here we further analyze the electronic interactions for the hh2 state to discuss why the two adsorption states with different o@xmath0 orientations ( i.e. hh1 and hh2 states ) are almost degenerate .",
    "figure 3 shows the calculated difference charge density @xmath11 for the hh2 state on the 5 ml pb(111 ) film , which is obtained by subtracting the electron densities of noninteracting component systems , @xmath12 , from the density @xmath13 of the hh2 state , while retaining the atomic positions of the component systems at the same location as in hh2 .",
    "a positive @xmath14 here represents charge accumulation , whereas a negative @xmath11 represents charge depletion .",
    "figure 3(a ) clearly shows a charge transfer from pb to o@xmath0 , which is consistent with the electronegativity difference between o and pb atoms , and same with what we found for the hh1 state @xcite .",
    "the contour plot for @xmath14 in the plane containing the two o atoms and parallel to the pb surface is shown fig .",
    "3(b ) , we can see that there is an electron depletion area in the middle of the two oxygen atoms , indicating the donation of electrons from bonding orbitals of o@xmath0 to pb .",
    "we can also see two electron accumulation areas around the two oxygen atoms indicating the back donation of electrons from pb to the @xmath15 antibonding orbital of o@xmath0 .",
    "this interaction mechanism of o@xmath0-to - surface donation and surface - to - o@xmath0 @xmath15 back donation is just the same with that in the hh1 state @xcite .",
    "so it is no wonder that the two adsorption states are nearly degenerate and have similar adsorption energies .    in comparison with the be(0001 ) , mg(0001 ) and al(111 ) surfaces , pb(111 ) is unique in that a parallel o@xmath0 molecularly adsorbs only on it .",
    "this is because of the different surface electronic structures .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the @xmath16 electronic states around the fermi energy strongly hybridize with @xmath17 states for both the mg and al surfaces ( also for the be(0001 ) surface @xcite ) , but does not hybridize at all for the pb(111 ) surface . as we have seen @xcite , the interaction between o@xmath0 and the pb(111 ) surface",
    "is mainly contributed by the electronic hybridizations between the frontier molecular orbitals ( the orbitals nearest to the fermi energy ) of o@xmath0 and electronic states of pb . according to the frontier orbital theory ,",
    "the interactions between o@xmath0 and other metals have similar mechanisms . however , the frontier orbitals of o@xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath15 ) are composed of @xmath16 electrons of oxygen , thus they are more compatible with @xmath16 electronic states than @xmath2 hybridized electronic states .",
    "this compatibility between frontier orbitals of o@xmath0 and @xmath16 states of pb finally leads to the molecular adsorption precursor states .",
    "after the studies and discussions for the adsorption on different pb(111 ) films , we now investigate the o@xmath0 dissociation . because of the existence of precursor states ,",
    "there are two different kinds of dissociation processes for o@xmath0 , respectively from o@xmath0 gases and from the molecular adsorption states .",
    "because the adiabatic calculations have been proved reliable for the o@xmath0/pb(111 ) system , we will calculate the adiabatic one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) potential energy surface ( pes ) cuts to evaluate the dissociation energy barriers for o@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the 1d pes cuts for an o@xmath0 molecule along the t-@xmath20 and b-@xmath20 channels are show in fig . 5 , together with the o - o bond length as functions of the o@xmath0 height @xmath21 from the 5 ml pb(111 ) film surface .",
    "the adsorption from o@xmath0 gas along the fh- and hh-@xmath20 channels will evolve into the molecular adsorption precursor states .",
    "clearly , the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath0 along the t-@xmath20 and b-@xmath22 channels are direct and activated , but no dissociative adsorption is found for an o@xmath0 molecules along the b-@xmath23 channel .",
    "this is different from the o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system , where the o@xmath0 dissociation along b-@xmath23 channel also occurs @xcite . among the calculated channels ,",
    "the lowest dissociation energy barrier is found to be 0.36 ev along the b-@xmath22 channel , with the o - o bond length and o@xmath0 height at the transition state to be 1.33 and 2.20 .",
    "the 1d pes cuts along the t-@xmath20 channels have similar distributions , and the corresponding energy barriers are 0.68 and 0.59 ev .",
    "the electronic interactions are then analyzed for the dissociation process from o@xmath0 gases .",
    "figure 6 shows the pdos for an o@xmath0 molecule at the initial , transition and final states of the dissociation path along the b-@xmath22 channel .",
    "we can see that at the initial state , the o@xmath0 molecule keeps its triplet electronic structure . as we have discussed , the lumo of o@xmath0 is above the fermi energy , proving the reliability of our adiabatic dft calculations .",
    "the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lumo are the spin - up and spin - down antibonding @xmath15 molecular orbitals , respectively .",
    "besides of homo and lumo , @xmath16 electrons of o@xmath0 make up of two bonding orbitals , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for both spins , the @xmath18 orbitals are lower in energy than the @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "when the o@xmath0 molecule evolves into the transition state , electrons transfer from the @xmath18 and @xmath19 molecular orbitals to pb through hybridizations . as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 peaks are diminished .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "6(b ) that the homo and lumo of o@xmath0 are broadened through hybridizations with electronic states of pb . during the electronic hybridizations , the spin splittings for all the o@xmath0 molecular orbitals",
    "are all decreased . in the final dissociated adsorption state ,",
    "the total spin of the adsorption system becomes zero .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "6(c ) that the molecular orbitals of o@xmath0 no longer exist after electronic hybridizations . as discussed in our previous work @xcite , the interactions between o and pb atoms display a mixed ionic / covalent character .",
    "the dissociation of o@xmath0 from the molecular adsorption precursor states are more complicated than from o@xmath0 gases because the formation and breaking of o - pb bonds during the dissociation of o@xmath0 also need to be considered .",
    "detailed information on the atomic adsorption of oxygen on the pb(111 ) surface can help us to simplify the problem . in our previous study @xcite",
    ", we have found that the o atoms choose to adsorb at hollow sites on the pb(111 ) surface .",
    "thus we only need to consider the dissociation of an adsorbed o@xmath0 molecule into different hollow sites . for an o@xmath0 molecule in the hh1 or hh2 state ,",
    "there are two different dissociation paths , respectively to the atomic adsorption of oxygen at two neighboring fcc and hcp hollow sites and to the atomic adsorption of oxygen at two fcc hollow sites .",
    "the calculated 2d pes cuts for the adsorbed o@xmath0 molecules in hh1 and hh2 states to dissociate into two neighboring hollow sites are shown in figs .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) , while the calculated 2d pes cuts for o@xmath0 to dissociate into two fcc hollow sites are also shown in figs . 7(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the calculated energy barriers for these four paths are respectively 0.22 , 0.26 , 0.59 and 0.37 ev .",
    "these values indicate that the most energetically favorable dissociation path for an adsorbed o@xmath0 molecule is from the hh1 adsorption state into the atomic adsorption of oxygen at two neighboring fcc and hcp hollow sites . the saddle point in fig .",
    "7(a ) corresponds to the adsorption structure of two oxygen atoms near two neighboring bridge sites , with their horizontal distance to be 1.40  .",
    "the smallest energy barriers for an o@xmath0 molecule in the fh1 and fh2 states to dissociate are both found to be 0.25 ev , which are larger than the smallest energy barrier from the hh1 state of 0.22 ev .",
    "the electronic properties are then analyzed for the dissociation path shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) , whose energy barrier is the smallest during the dissociation from molecular adsorption precursor states .",
    "the pdos around the two oxygen atoms are calculated for the corresponding initial , transition and final states .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) , the @xmath15 antibonding orbital of o@xmath0 are broadened and shifted below the fermi energy in the hh1 adsorption state , through hybridizations with @xmath16 electronic states of pb . at the transition state of the dissociation process , the energy interval between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 orbitals is decreased from 6.58 to 6.24 ev , and the oxygen @xmath26 states hybridize in a different way with electronic states of pb from that in the hh1 adsorption state . at the end of the dissociation process",
    ", the two oxygen atoms relax into two neighboring hollow sites , and the molecular orbitals of o@xmath0 all disappear after electronic hybridizations .",
    "after the systematic studies on the o@xmath0 dissociation in different ways , we reveal that the most energetically favorable one is from the hh1 adsorption state into two neighboring hollow sites .",
    "it is always believed that because of the confinement of the two boundaries in the vertical direction , the quantum behavior of electrons will cause a number of unique properties for thin metal films that could be superior to their bulk counterpart . in particular , quantum size effects on surface reactivity have been studied extensively for applications in catalysis , corrosion , and gas sensing .",
    "here we further consider the dissociation path for o@xmath0 molecules on different pb(111 ) films , including both the dissociation along the t- and b-@xmath20 channels from o@xmath0 gases , and the dissociation from molecular adsorption states .",
    "after systematic calculations , we find that the most energetically favorable dissociation paths are the same on different pb(111 ) films , i.e. from the hh1 adsorption state to the atomic adsorption of two oxygen atoms at two neighboring hollow sites .",
    "figure 9 shows the 2d pes cuts for the o@xmath0 dissociation on 4@xmath277 monolayers pb(111 ) films .",
    "the calculated energy barriers are respectively 0.26 , 0.22 , 0.26 and 0.24 ev . since many properties of pb(111 ) films such as work function and surface energy show bilayer oscillation behaviors because of qse @xcite .",
    "the even - odd oscillation of the dissociation energy barrier proves the modulation of qse on the o@xmath0 dissociation on pb(111 ) films .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules on different pb(111 ) films .",
    "the electronic states of an o@xmath0 molecule in close to the pb films are firstly analyzed and imply that the adiabatic calculations are reliable . for the molecular adsorption precursor states ,",
    "we find that the electronic interactions are very similar in the hh1 and hh2 states , and they are thus two nearly degenerate states . besides , we further point out that no @xmath17-@xmath16 hybridizations in pb(111 ) films is the main reason for the existence of molecular adsorption precursor states . based on our adiabatic pes calculations ,",
    "we find that the dissociation of o@xmath0 from the molecular adsorption precursor states have lower energy barriers than from o@xmath0 gases . the most energetically favorable dissociation paths on different pb(111 ) films",
    "are found to be the same , which is from the hh1 adsorption state to the atomic adsorption of two oxygen atoms at two neighboring hollow sites .",
