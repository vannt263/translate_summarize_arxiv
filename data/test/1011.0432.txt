    "recent observations lend strong support to the existence of disks back to even higher redshifts @xcite , and for disk assembly at even higher redshifts in the form of clump - chain galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field @xcite .",
    "results from large surveys suggest that there has been only weak evolution in disk sizes since @xmath2=1 .",
    "there is no evidence that the size function of disks has evolved back to @xmath2=1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the shape of the size function did not evolve with redshift , though the normalization ( or amplitude ) did .",
    "this can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , the normalization will vary if the number density of disks varies with time .",
    "however , observations suggest that the number density of disks is constant to @xmath2=1 @xcite .",
    "second , if it is assumed that galaxies dim with time ( e.g. , due to a passively evolving stellar population or decline in star formation rate ) , a 1 to 1.5 magnitude dimming since @xmath2=1 could explain the change in normalization , while keeping the size distribution of disks constant @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no immediate evidence for a change in the sizes of galaxy disks with time .",
    "studies of the evolution in the magnitude ",
    "size relationship for disk galaxies back to @xmath2=1 have found similar results .",
    "importantly , these studies must use surface brightness evolution to interpret evolution within the magnitude  size plane .",
    "this is not straightforward , as an increase in disk scale lengths at a fixed magnitude between @xmath2=1 and @xmath2=0 can be mimicked by a decrease in luminosity at a fixed size @xcite .",
    "selection effects are difficult to disentangle , and studies that require high and low @xmath2 samples to adhere to the same selection biases have found that large disks are consistent with no evolution in surface brightness @xcite .",
    "later studies concluded that this work was too restrictive , and that a careful treatment of completeness as a function of redshift supports surface brightness dimming over time @xcite .",
    "most studies conclude that pure size evolution at a fixed magnitude is ruled out @xcite . instead ,",
    "the observed surface brightness evolution is best explained by luminosity dimming , with the amount of dimming dependent on galaxy size so that lower mass galaxies have undergone more dimming since @xmath2=1 than massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , some amount of size evolution ca nt be ruled out , and at least weak size evolution is favored @xcite .    while magnitude is assumed to scale with the mass of a galaxy , it is obvious from the above discussion that magnitude at a given mass is not necessarily constant in time . the more fundamental relation is between size and stellar mass .",
    "magnitude at a given stellar mass is likely to increase back to @xmath2=1 due to the fact that there is an evolving star formation rate ( sfr )  mass relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the stellar mass  size relation for disk dominated galaxies back to @xmath2=1 , and found weak or no evolution .",
    "this result can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , given the change of @xmath81 magnitude of surface brightness dimming in the same population , the result is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population at a given mass , with no growth of galaxy disks .",
    "second , it could imply that galaxies are growing , but that they must grow in such a way as to evolve _ along _ the stellar mass  size relation with time .    on the other hand",
    ", galaxy disk formation theory predicts that the sizes of disks , both individual and as a population , should be growing since @xmath2=1 . in the standard picture , gas in a halo conserves its specific angular momentum ( equal to that of the dark matter ) as it cools to form a centrifugally supported disk that grows from the inside out @xcite . in the simplest model , in which the density profile of galaxies is modeled as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) ,",
    "the radius of the resulting disk is proportional to the parent halo virial radius , which grows inversely with the hubble parameter , @xmath9 . for a concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite",
    ", this relation predicts that disks at @xmath2=1 should be nearly a factor of two smaller than their @xmath2=0 counterparts at the same circular velocity , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopted more reasonable assumptions to update the simple theoretical model that suggests that galaxy disks should grow by nearly a factor of two since @xmath2=1 , primarily by adopting nfw density profiles rather than sis profiles . unlike the sis model , the concentrations of nfw profiles were lower in the past .",
    "combined with disk stability arguments @xcite , this model predicts a much weaker evolution in disk sizes ( 15%-20% ) at a fixed stellar mass , consistent with the @xcite results .",
    "these semi - analytic models ( sams ) do not follow the evolution of individual disk galaxies with time .",
    "rather , they examine an instantaneous population of disks . clearly , this is the type of information derived from observations , but it prevents an interpretation of the evolution in individual disk galaxies based on observations of the population as a whole .",
    "@xcite instead follow the evolution of individual disks in their sam , and demonstrate that disks tend to grow along the stellar mass  size relation , with only weak evolution , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "the analytic models discussed above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have until recently been the only available theoretical tool with which to investigate the evolution of galactic disk sizes ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "simulations , with their ability to capture complex gas processes in mergers and subsequent sf , should be an ideal tool that allow a better trace of the distribution of stellar light , while sams must assume that light follows mass .",
    "however , simulations of disk galaxy formation in a cdm context have historically produced unrealistic disks that are too compact ( dense ) , too small overall , and rotating too fast at a given radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this failure has been named the `` angular momentum catastrophe . ''",
    "this catastrophe has been largely associated with the overcooling problem , in which baryons cool too quickly at early times and become very dense and concentrated at the center of halos before merging .",
    "these halos then experience dynamical friction in subsequent mergers , and the resulting disks show the classic signs of the angular momentum catastrophe @xcite .",
    "thus , feedback mechanisms at early times have historically been invoked to prevent overcooling with moderate success @xcite but additional artificial exchange of angular momentum can still occur between baryons and dark matter in sph simulations with low numerical resolution @xcite .",
    "hence , to avoid the angular momentum catastrophe and produce realistic disks , simulations must have both a physically motivated feedback prescription , and very high numerical ( mass and force ) resolution @xcite .",
    "the simulations used in this study are part of a suite of very high numerical resolution disk galaxy simulations that incorporate a star formation ( sf ) and supernova ( sn ) feedback scheme that has been shown to overcome many of the past problems of disk galaxy simulations to successfully match a number of observed properties of galaxies ( as discussed further below , and shown by the results of this paper ) .    in this paper , we use simulations of individual disk galaxies to follow their evolution in the magnitude  size plane and the stellar mass  size plane .",
    "we attempt to mimic the observations of these galaxies in a manner similar to the observed population , generating mock surface brightness images to measure disk scale lengths , avoiding the assumption that light must follow mass .",
    "we demonstrate that the simulated galaxies have properties similar to real galaxies . in ",
    "2 we describe our small sample of very high resolution simulated disk galaxies that span a representative range of masses , merger histories , and spin values .",
    "we show that our limited sample is in excellent agreement with the population of galaxies surveyed at both @xmath2=0 (  3 ) and @xmath2=1 (  4 ) . in  5 , we disentangle the evolution of individual galaxies from the evolution seen in the population as a whole .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "these simulations were run with the n - body + smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gasoline @xcite in a fully cosmological @xmath0cdm context using wmap year 3 parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath0=0.74 , @xmath12 , @xmath13=0.77 , n=0.96 ) .",
    "the galaxies were originally selected from either a 25mpc or 50mpc ( depending on their mass ) n - body simulation with uniform mass resolution throughout , and then resimulated at higher resolution with baryons using the volume renormalization technique @xcite .",
    "this technique allows for significantly higher resolution on the central galaxy while also capturing the effect of large scale torques that are thought to deliver angular momentum to the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the sf / sn scheme used in these simulations has been shown to effectively regulate star formation efficiency as a function of halo mass , resulting in a stellar mass  metallicity relationship for the simulated galaxies that is in excellent agreement with observations both locally and at high @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this regulation of star formation also leads to realistic trends in gas fractions , with our lowest mass galaxies being the most gas rich @xcite , reproducing the observed incidence rate of damped lyman @xmath14 systems ( qso - dlas ) at @xmath2 = 3 @xcite , and the column densities of both qso - dlas and grb - dlas at @xmath2 = 3 @xcite .",
    "of critical importance for the present study is the fact that these simulated disks maintain sufficient angular momentum to match the observed tully - fisher relationship @xcite and produce galaxies with realistic disk sizes , as shown below .",
    "the full details of our physically motivated sn feedback implementation were originally presented in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the sf prescription ensures that the sfr density is a function of gas density according to the observed slope of the kennicutt - schmidt law , and a sf efficiency parameter , @xmath15 , sets the normalization of this relation .",
    "each star particle represents a simple stellar population , born with a kroupa initial mass function @xcite . as massive stars go sn , energy and metals are deposited into the nearest neighbor gas particles .",
    "the sn feedback recipe calculates the radius affected , and turns off cooling in those affected neighboring gas particles until the end of the snowplow phase as described by the sedov - taylor solution @xcite .",
    "the amount of energy deposited amongst those neighbors is 0.4@xmath1610@xmath17 ergs , as was adopted in all of our previous work mentioned above .",
    "additionally , we include a uniform uv cosmic background following an updated model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that when force resolutions @xmath18100pc can be achieved , high density peaks that mimic sf regions in giant molecular clouds can be resolved with several hundreds of gas particles in @xmath810@xmath19 m@xmath7  clumps ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "must be offset by a slightly higher value of @xmath15 = 0.1 .",
    "this prescription leads to enhanced gas outflows that remove low angular momentum gas from the central regions of the galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brook et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . at low masses ,",
    "this creates a bulgeless disk with a linearly rising rotation curve , comparable to those observed ( oh et al .",
    ", in prep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low mass galaxies used in this paper , drawn from a 25mpc volume , can achieve force resolutions @xmath8100pc .",
    "hence , these simulations adopt the more realistic feedback prescription with high density sf and @xmath15 = 0.1 .",
    "however , the more massive galaxies presented here are drawn from 50mpc volumes , making it computational expensive to achieve similar force resolutions in a reasonable time .",
    "hence , these simulated galaxies can not resolve the high density sf peaks easily , and a lower sf density threshold must be adopted , 0.1 amu/@xmath20 , with a lower @xmath15 = 0.05 .",
    "these latter values have been adopted in all of our previous work on mw mass galaxies @xcite , and are a compromise that allow realistic disks to form , but are inefficient at driving gas outflows .",
    "thus , low angular momentum material that might be lost from the central regions is maintained , helping lead to the creation of large bulges in the mw mass galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "additionally , the creation of these large bulges can be due to missing physics .",
    "in particular , agn feedback has not yet been added to these simulations , and is potentially a key mechanism to help create realistic bulges . due to our small sample size , it is difficult to quantify if our bulges are substantially different from observed bulges in the same galaxy mass range .",
    "the simulated galaxies used in this work were selected to span a range of spin values and merger histories , with the last major merger redshift as low at 0.8 .",

    ". this effect can be reduced at higher mass resolutions that lower the discrepancy in particle masses .",
    "@xcite used controlled ( non - cosmological ) n - body+sph simulations to evaluate the amount of angular momentum that can be lost purely due to resolution .",

    "even if resolution can be increased to the point of maximum angular momentum retention , disks will still suffer dramatic angular momentum loss compared to observed disk galaxies if energy feedback is neglected .",
    "feedback prevents rapid , early cooling of gas particles ( the overcooling problem discussed in the introduction ; see references therein ) .",
    "heating and expansion of the gas creates a hot reservoir , allowing the gas to cool at later times after the era of rapid mergers , and preventing angular momentum loss via dynamical friction in mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , by preventing overcooling , feedback prevents gas from rapidly turning into collisionless star particles . without feedback , halos of all masses are equally efficient at converting gas into stars @xcite , producing galaxies that are too gas poor compared to @xmath2 = 0 disk galaxies .",
    "because feedback regulates star formation , it allows for gas reservoirs to develop that allow disks to survive to the present day @xcite .",
    "the existence of large , thin disks at the present day thus requires feedback .",
    "not all sn feedback schemes lead to disk galaxies that satisfy observed constraints such as the tully - fisher relation , size  velocity or size  luminosity relations , or the stellar mass  metallicity relation .",
    "because the nearest neighbor gas particles surrounding sne are dense and cold , a simple energy deposition will quickly be radiated away and not affect the simulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "two main schemes have been adopted to overcome this problem . in the first , a multiphase model of the ism",

    ", cooling is turned off in the gas particles near a sn explosion in order to mimic the sub - resolution adiabatic expansion of the sn @xcite .",
    "the `` blastwave '' scheme adopted here also turns off cooling in nearest neighbor particles , but attempts to model this based on what is known about actual sne , determining the radius of each sn remnant based on the analytic blastwave solution for a sn remnant @xcite , and cooling is only turned off for those particles within the blast radius . because many sne typically contribute feedback within a dense star forming region , the thermal energy from all of these sne can combine to create a larger blast radius .",
    "the differences in the resulting disk between a simple energy deposition ( `` thermal '' feedback ) and the blastwave model have been examined in @xcite and @xcite . as examined by these previous works , the adoption of the `` blastwave '' feedback model , combined with high resolution ( all simulations presented here have more than 10@xmath19 particles within the virial radius at @xmath2 = 0 , see table  [ simsum ] ) , overcome past problems with cosmological disk galaxy simulations and allow for the present study .",

    "this trend for @xmath61 to be larger than @xmath46 has been seen previously in simulations @xcite , and has been suggested as one reason why disks may have a smaller fraction of low angular momentum than their dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used a similar simulation run with gasoline to show that gas that enters the virial radius of a halo and cools toward the disk is torqued by the hot halo gas , so that the angular momentum of the disk gas becomes aligned with the hot halo .",
    "this is true even for gas that is initially counter - rotating with the disk , and hence is a powerful method to remove negative and low angular momentum material from the disk . the lack of low angular momentum material for the disk gas will lead to larger values of @xmath61 compared to @xmath46 for the total halo .",
    "the disk stars , whose light we trace in the results of this paper , form from this cold gas with larger spin values , and thus @xmath61 will be a better predictor for the nfw @xmath60 than @xmath46 .",

    "we note that the @xcite data is for total stellar mass , while our simulated results are for the disk only ( bulge excluded ) .",
    "however , including the bulge mass will only exacerbate the discrepancy .",
    "for the massive galaxies , the discrepancy is probably due to the fact that these simulations are known to form too many stars @xcite .",
    "we can learn something about _ when _",
    "this overproduction of stars occurs in the simulations by also examining the stellar mass  ssfr plot ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) . while within the observed scatter , is appears that the ssfrs of the simulated disks are consistently lower than observational results at both @xmath2=1 and @xmath2=0 @xcite .",
    "these plots demonstrate that these simulated galaxies must be forming too many stars at early times , at redshifts higher than plotted here ( @xmath66 1 ) . because the sfrs of the galaxies are in good agreement with observed galaxies in the same halo mass range at both @xmath2=1 and @xmath2=0 @xcite , the fact that the ssfrs are lower than observed values requires that the stellar mass of these disks be too large by @xmath2=1 .",
    "the story is slightly different for the two dwarf disk simulations .",
    "these two dwarf galaxies have been published previously in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that their properties are a good match to observed dwarf disk galaxies , including stellar mass @xcite .",
    "however , the observed ssfrs of low mass galaxies is on average higher than that of massive galaxies @xcite , indicating that low mass galaxies have been very inefficient in the past at turning gas into stars .",
    "clearly , that is not the case with our two simulated dwarf disk galaxies , which have too low ssfrs compared to most observed dwarf galaxies due to the fact that they form the bulk of their stars prior to @xmath2=1 .",
    "hence , while approximately the correct mass in stars is formed , the star formation is biased toward @xmath66 1 .",
    "we have verified that these two simulations , when run with stronger sn feedback , have burstier sf histories with their sf spread out more evenly down to the present time .",
    "this leads to approximately the same mass in stars formed by @xmath2=0 , but with a more uniform sf history .",
    "this means that the stronger feedback dwarf runs have higher ssfrs than currently presented here , and ssfr values larger than the massive galaxy simulations shown here .",
    "future work will include these new dwarf disks , which show similar stellar masses , rotational velocities , and sizes to those presented in this paper .",
    "thus , in all of the simulated galaxies the star formation history is biased toward too much star formation at high @xmath2 .",
    "by @xmath2=0 , though , the dwarf galaxies have formed approximately the observed amount of stars for their halo mass , while the more massive galaxies have overproduced the total amount of stars .",
    "it is suspected that this overproduction of stars in the massive galaxy disks may be the result of the adopted low sf density threshold , which allows for most of the disk to be capable of sf at any given time , unlike the high density threshold which limits sf only to rare density peaks .",
    "however , as discussed in section 2.1 , it is currently computationally expensive to generate the more massive galaxies with the force resolution required to resolve high density peaks where sf occurs , and no simulations of sufficiently high resolution are currently available to test this hypothesis .",
    "the adopted sf threshold is a compromise that allows stars to form at radii observed in real galaxy disks , and we have demonstrated that it leads to scale lengths in good agreement with observed galaxies .",
    "however , we note that even if our massive galaxies are forming too many stars , it is by roughly a factor of 3 at most , and at early times .",
    "this means that the more massive galaxies may shift up to 0.5 dex to lower stellar masses in the stellar mass  size plane , but will still grow along the stellar mass  size relation , so that our conclusions are unaffected .",
    "likewise , the @xmath1 band magnitudes we present here are unlikely to be affected , as the bulk of overproduced stars must occur at @xmath66 1 .",
    "since @xmath1 band light is dominated by young stars , and our low @xmath2 sfrs are in good agreement with observed galaxies in the same halo mass range , the magnitude  size relations presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : z0 ] and [ fig : magsize ] are unlikely to change .",
    "hence , the conclusions presented here about the origin of the evolution in the size  luminosity relation remain valid .",
    "for the first time , a sample of very high resolution galaxy disks simulated within a fully cosmological context have been used to determine the evolution of the galaxy disk size  magnitude relation .",
    "unlike previous simulations , we determine disk scale lengths and magnitudes by fitting the stellar light profile rather than decomposing our simulations based on kinematics ( and hence mass ) .",
    "we generate artificial surface brightness images using sunrise @xcite , in order to derive disk properties using methods used by observers .",
    "exponential disk scale lengths were derived using galfit @xcite with redshifted , surface brightness dimmed @xmath29 band images at @xmath2=1 and 0.5 , and rest frame @xmath1 band images at @xmath2=0 .",
    "this allows for a direct comparison between simulated and observational results in the size  magnitude plane .",
    "[ fig : z0 ] demonstrates that these galaxies overcome past inabilities for cosmological disk simulations to retain angular momentum .",
    "artificial loss of angular momentum is minimized due to high resolution and a physically motivated sn feedback recipe , and hence we produce disks with realistic sizes compared to observed disks . fig .",
    "[ fig : magsize ] shows that the sizes are in agreement with observed disk sizes back to @xmath2=1 .",
    "this success , and our previous successes in matching the observed stellar mass  metallicity relation with time @xcite , and the tully - fisher relationship @xcite , indicate that these simulated disks reproduce the fundamental scaling relations for disk galaxies .",
    "having established this , we can now use these simulated disks to investigate and interpret observational findings .",
    "we use the simulated disk properties to investigate the evolution in the magnitude ",
    "size relation with time .",
    "observations have generally concluded that there has been 1 to 1.5 magnitudes of surface brightness dimming since @xmath2=1 @xcite .",
    "we find similar evolution for our galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ deltamu ] ) . combined with a lack of evidence for an evolving size function for galaxy disks @xcite , and little to no growth in galaxy disks",
    "sizes back to @xmath2=1 @xcite , the observed surface brightness evolution can only be interpreted as an upper limit to luminosity evolution if there has been no change in galaxy disk sizes .",
    "we have shown that we 1 ) are in good agreement with the observed magnitude ",
    "size relation with time and the evolution in surface brightness , but 2 ) a number of the simulated disks are clearly undergoing a large change in size ( figs .",
    "[ dmagsize ] and [ evolsize ] ) .",
    "our ability to follow individual galaxies with time , unlike the observations , allows us to interpret the evolution in the magnitude  size plane .",
    "we find that the evolution is dependent on mass , with our massive galaxies undergoing larger changes in size than magnitude .",
    "our dwarf galaxies undergo the least change in size , though there is no immediate theoretical expectation that this should be the case .",
    "recent results @xcite show that the rate of growth of halos has little dependence on mass , and thus low mass galaxies should grow just as much in size as their more massive counterparts .",
    "we conclude that a larger sample is needed to study if low mass galaxies truly grow less than more massive galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution in magnitude for dwarf disk galaxies is dependent on their bursty sf history , but an individual dwarf can undergo significant dimming of at least 2 magnitudes . a dichotomy of evolution with mass has been seen in observations , with low mass galaxies exhibiting significantly more dimming since @xmath2=1 than more massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the halo properties for these galaxies ( @xmath67 ) predict a scale length that is generally shorter than the scale lengths derived from the simulated light profiles . fig .",
    "[ ml ] demonstrates that the light and mass distributions yield scale lengths in good agreement , so the discrepancy between @xmath60 predicted for nfw halos and from our light profiles can not be due to a discrepancy between light and mass profiles .",
    "rather , using @xmath61 , the spin of the gas in the halo , brings the predicted and measured scale lengths into decent agreement .",
    "thus , the angular momentum distribution of the gas from which the stars are forming has been modified from that of the dark matter ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that accreted gas is torqued by the hot halo after entering the virial radius , potentially preventing counter - rotating and low angular momentum gas from reaching the disk .",
    "a full examination of how this process occurs is beyond the scope of this paper and left for future work .",
    "having determined that these galaxies are growing in size with time , we can investigate this growth in stellar mass . like previous theoretical models",
    "@xcite , we find that these galaxies grow in such a way as to stay along approximately the same stellar mass  size relation with time . hence , at a fixed stellar mass , there is little change back to @xmath2=1 in the size of galaxies .    due to the fact that our larger galaxies have grown since @xmath2=1",
    ", we do not have the ability to directly compare results at a fixed size .",
    "in particular , we do not have a population of simulated disks at @xmath2=1 with scale length greater than 3 kpc , though these larger disks do exist observationally .",
    "presumably we might generate these larger disks if we simulate higher mass halos .",
    "however , it is not clear from this study how these larger disks would evolve to @xmath2=0 .",
    "observationally , the number density of disk galaxies shows no evidence for change back to @xmath2=1 @xcite . in conjunction with the apparent lack of evolution in the size function of disks",
    ", this fact has been interpreted to mean that either galaxies are done growing by @xmath2=1 , or that the rate of destruction of galaxies at given size must be equally matched by the rate of growth of galaxies into that size .",
    "the fact that our galaxies are growing , while still matching the size - magnitude evolution , suggests that galaxies are moving into and out of a given bin in size during this time interval .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to answer what happens to these larger galaxies , though we may speculate .",
    "there are two possibilities that arise due to mergers ; perhaps the larger disks undergo mergers and become early type galaxies @xcite , or perhaps mergers cause them to become bulge dominated disks . as the majority of size - magnitude evolution studies have focused on pure disks or disks with small bulges , this would remove them from the sample being considered @xcite .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the simulated galaxy disks follow sfr  mass and ssfr  mass relations similar to observations . while the growth of dark matter halos is nearly self - similar with mass ,",
    "observations demonstrate that some process must break this self - similarity in the baryons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the mass range of galaxy halos presented here ,",
    "sn feedback is the process that regulates sf as a function of halo mass , and likely drives gas outflows that vary as a function of mass ( though outflow rates are left for future work ) .",
    "the regulation of sf as a function of mass leads to the reproduction of the observed stellar mass  metallicity relationship @xcite , and the sfr  mass relation shown here that is responsible for the reproduction of the size ",
    "luminosity relation back to @xmath2=1 .",
    "a galaxy at a fixed m@xmath4 at @xmath2=1 will have a higher sfr than a @xmath2=0 counterpart , and thus a higher luminosity as well . in conjunction with the weak evolution of the stellar mass  size relation , this tells us that the difference in luminosity observed at a fixed size between @xmath2=1 and @xmath2=0 is due to the fact that the @xmath2=1 galaxy has a higher sfr and luminosity .",
