    "the preparation of many - particle entangled states is becoming a fundamental task in modern quantum physics .",
    "entanglement lies at the heart of quantum communication and quantum information and is also a fundamental resource in precision spectroscopy . with recent advances in the manipulation of trapped ions and neutral atoms ,",
    "there has been significant progress in the preparation of many - body entanglement states in atomic gases @xcite .",
    "such systems therefore offer rich opportunities to investigate new physics with both practical and fundamental applications .    here",
    "we propose an interferometric method that uses the entanglement that emerges during the many - body dynamics between interacting spinor atoms to perform precision measurements of their interatomic interaction strength , usually parameterized by the @xmath3-wave scattering length .",
    "our method is a many - body generalization of the technique reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where information of the scattering properties was obtained by using the entanglement dynamics in pairs of atoms trapped in the ground state of a potential well .",
    "a precise determination of the scattering properties has broad and important applications beyond atomic physics .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that such type of measurements might be useful for fundamental physics , as by monitoring the scattering length on the @xmath4 level one could detect variation in the electron to proton mass ratio on the level of @xmath5 .",
    "standard ramsey spectroscopy starts with a system of @xmath0 non - interacting spin @xmath1 particles initially prepared in the same internal state .",
    "subsequently , a ramsey pulse prepares it in a coherent superposition of the two internal states and the system is let to evolve freely for a time during which a relative phase accumulates , @xmath6 , due to the energy splitting between the two states .",
    "the latter is then decoded by using a second ramsey pulse which maps the phase onto a population difference , thus allowing to perform precision measurements of the atomic transition frequency .",
    "the statistical fluctuations associated with a finite sampling yields a lower limit in the phase accuracy @xmath7 called the shot noise limit @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle , however , allows for phase accuracies consistent with the basic principles of quantum mechanics , as low as @xmath8 , called the heisenberg limit .",
    "the latter can be achieved by using initially entangled atoms instead of a polarized sample @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a spectroscopy technique which aims to measure the atomic interaction parameters arising form two - body collisions by using similar ramsey spectroscopic ideas , but applied to interacting atoms instead of non - interacting ones .",
    "the many - body interactions during the free evolution build in quantum mechanical correlations between the atoms and generates a large amount of entanglement even from an initially uncorrelated sample @xcite .",
    "this scheme provides a resolution which is fundamentally limited to @xmath2 , a factor of @xmath0 smaller than the heisenberg limit achievable with non - interacting atoms .",
    "moreover , for initially uncorrelated atoms the sensitivity scales as @xmath9 , implying a gain in resolution by a factor of @xmath10 with respect to the classical shot noise resolution . a more general analysis of beyond - heisenberg scaling for multi - body collisions or tensor - field interactions has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "many - particle entangled states , however , are difficult to prepare and maintain since they are extremely fragile : in practice , noise and decoherence rapidly collapse entangled states into classical statistical mixtures .",
    "for example in standard ramsey spectroscopy decoherence destroys the potential gain provided by entanglement , and , when it is taken into account both initially uncorrelated and maximally entangled states provide the same shot noise resolution @xcite .",
    "here we show that decoherence degrades the sensitivity of our method to @xmath11 for initially entangled atoms and to @xmath12 for initially uncorrelated ones .",
    "this scaling is interesting as it demonstrates that the entanglement build up by the many - body interactions helps , even with decoherence , to keep the sensitivity achievable with initially squeezed atoms above the maximally achievable with initially uncorrelated particles .",
    "we also discuss physical implementation of our scheme using a ) spinor bose- einstein condensates and b ) fermionic atoms loaded in optical lattices and compare and contrast the advantage and disadvantages of these two possible set - ups .",

    "these states are highly squeezed , and a robust method to generate them can have also applications in heisenberg limited phase detection @xcite . the idea is to adiabatically convert @xmath111 into @xmath112 by gradually increasing @xmath113 from @xmath114 to @xmath115 in the following time dependent hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath116the first term proportional to @xmath117 is required to keep the system within @xmath56 . as shown in fig .",

    "in realistic experiments decoherence effects are inevitably present .",
    "the main type of decoherence is dephasing due to processes that cause random changes in the relative phase of the quantum states , while preserving the total atomic population in the atomic levels . among the mechanisms that result in dephasing effects one can consider collisions , stray fields , and laser instabilities .",
    "we model the phase decoherence by adding a term to the hamiltonian given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 are independent random gaussian variables with zero mean and white noise correlation functions @xmath125 that represent couplings with the environment . here",
    "the bar denotes averaging over the different outcomes of the random variables .",
    "this model is equivalent to considering the time evolution of the reduced density operator for a single ion @xmath126 as given by the master equation @xmath127-\\gamma /2(\\sigma _ { z}\\hat{\\rho}\\sigma _ { z}-\\hat{\\rho})$ ] .    to include the effect of decoherence it is simpler to go to the uncoupled basis which diagonalizes both @xmath128 and @xmath20 .",
    "each state in this basis can be label as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 . using the uncorrelated nature of the @xmath132 variables one can show by straightforward calculations that @xcite    @xmath133    with @xmath134 and@xmath135 .",
    "note that these equations are valid for an arbitrary initial state .",
    "the noise induces an exponential decay of the average signal and its higher moments .",
    "however , unlike the average signal the higher moments are also affected by the presence of diffusion terms .    if we assume an initially coherent state with @xmath136 and @xmath137 given by eqs .",

    "in contrast to the ideal dynamics where the longer the interrogation time @xmath25 the better is the phase accuracy , when decoherence is accounted for , one has to optimize with respect to both @xmath25 and @xmath104 , in order to obtain the best sensitivity . provided that @xmath138 , standard minimization yields :    @xmath139    at @xmath140{\\frac{2}{n^3 } ( e^{\\tau_{opt}}-1)}$ ] and @xmath141 .",
    "note that even with initially uncorrelated atoms decoherence reduces the sensitivity by a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with standard ramsey spectroscopy done with non - interacting atoms , where the phase resolution with initially uncorrelated atoms has the same classical shot noise resolution so is not too much affected by decoherence .",
    "the reason of the different behavior is the fact that @xmath143 builds up particle correlations during the evolution and transforms uncorrelated states into highly squeezed ones which are vulnerable to decoherence . more specifically , as shown in ref .",

    "these states are very fragile and decohere @xmath0 times faster than uncorrelated particles .",

    "the coupling strength @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath157 with @xmath158 the s wave scattering length between particles of type @xmath159 and @xmath160 , @xmath161 the atom mass and @xmath162 the volume .    due to the dependence of @xmath101 on the elastic scattering length difference , @xmath163 , using an inter - state feshbach resonance @xcite ,",
    "such as the one predicted between the @xmath164 and @xmath154 states in @xmath165 atoms , one could widely tune @xmath101 by varying an external magnetic field .",
    "close to the feshbach resonance there is a singularity in the scattering length , @xmath166 with @xmath167 being the resonance width , @xmath168 the zero energy resonance and @xmath169 the background scattering length .",
    "this singularity is due to the near degeneracy of the collision energy of the atoms with the binding energy of an extremely loose diatomic molecular state .",
    "one can use our spectroscopy technique to measure @xmath170 in such system .",
    "however , in order for the method to work , it is important to reduce two and three body particle losses across the resonance , as they can considerably affect the sensitivity .",
    "we estimate for example the effect of two - body losses by solving the following master equation :    @xmath171-\\gamma /2(\\hat{c}^\\dagger \\hat{c } \\hat{\\rho}+ \\hat{\\rho } \\hat{c}^\\dagger \\hat{c}- 2\\hat{c}^\\dagger \\hat{\\rho } \\hat{c } ) , \\ ] ]    with @xmath172 the operator that destroys a pair atoms in different spin states and which account for inelastic spin relaxation processes across the resonance . here",

    "the plot demonstrates the drastic reduction of the sensitivity with @xmath173 . for both initially uncorrelated atoms and initially squeezed atoms",
    "one requires to limit @xmath186 to have at least shot noise resolution , i.e @xmath187 .",
    "experimentally both two and three body particle losses contribute . as three body losses scale as the four power of the scattering length @xcite they decrease faster than two - body losses away from the resonance .",
    "as such , the sensitivity of the method can be optimized by , on one hand , tuning the magnetic field far enough from the resonance so that mainly two - body losses are relevant and , on the other , by reducing @xmath176 by using a very narrow feshbach resonance , and by considering species of atoms that belong to the lowest magnetic manifold so they posses long relaxation times .",
    "recently the dynamics of bosonic atoms with two relevant internal states loaded in a deep optical lattice has been used to perform precision measurements of atomic scattering properties @xcite . explicitly , the experiment detected the modification in the ramsey fringes caused by frequency shifts induced by interatomic interactions in wells occupied with two atoms , and used it to measure the elastic scattering length difference .",
    "as the various wells in the optical lattice behave as independent wells due to the suppressed tunneling between them , the experimental phase sensitivity was limited to the shot noise resolution associated to statistical fluctuations in a finite number of wells . in practice however , the sensitivity was much lower due to the two - body losses close to the feshbach resonance in the double occupied wells .",
    "we now discuss how to generalize these ideas by using the collective spin dynamics ( instead of the single well one ) of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice loaded with one atom per site .",
    "specifically we demonstrate how to engineer an effective @xmath188 hamiltonian in such systems .",
    "the latter can be used to perform measurements of the scattering properties via the entanglement dynamics but without the limitation of particle losses at the resonance .",
    "the effective dynamics of a system of spinor ultra - cold atoms confined in a unit filled lattice , deep in the mott insulator regime @xcite can be described in terms of effective spin operators , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , where @xmath191 are the annihilation operator of a particle of type @xmath192 at site @xmath193 , and @xmath194 are number operators . in such spin variables the effective hamiltonian maps to a spin xxz hamiltonian @xcite :",

    "therefore , by adding a @xmath210 term via a raman transition with effective two - photon rabi frequency @xmath211 @xcite one can also implement in such lattice systems eq .",
    "( [ hadiabatic ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian allows , as described above , for the squeezed state preparation .",
    "the realization of @xmath212 in unit filled optical lattices has the strong advantage that two and three body losses are suppressed and thus they are not longer a limitation in these systems .",
    "it is important to note , however , that only fermionic atoms can be used if @xmath101 is going to be tuned by means of a feshbach resonance .",

    "on the other hand , for fermions , as @xmath213 grows , the ratio @xmath214 remains constant .",
    "the drawback of the lattice implementation is the factor of @xmath0 in the denominator of the effective @xmath101 , because the slower dynamics limits the sensitivity of our method .",

    "additionally close to the resonance @xmath217 can be enhanced up to about @xmath218 times its off resonance value @xcite .",

    "thus , in order to keep the measurement time in a reasonable experimental time scale , one should limit the experiment to 1d lattice systems which have of the order of @xmath221 atoms per tube @xcite .",
    "the scalability problem certainly limits the achievable sensitivity .",

    "in summary , here we proposed an inteferometric method that relays on the quantum dynamics of interacting spins to perform precision measurements of the scattering properties with a resolution fundamentally limited to @xmath2 .",
    "we discussed the class of squeezed states that are required to achieve heisenberg sensitivity and proposed a method for its generation .",
    "we studied the effect of decoherence and showed that it affects the achievable sensitivity even with initially uncorrelated atoms as they become vulnerable due the many - particle entanglement builded during the many - body dynamics .",
    "we also showed that the dynamically induced quantum correlations help to keep the sensitivity of initially squeezed states above the uncorrelated atom threshold even with decoherence .",
    "this has to be contrasted with standard ramsey spectroscopy with non - interacting atoms where all the potential gain in sensitivity due to initial quantum correlation is lost in the presence of decoherence .",
    "finally we discussed possible physical implementation of the proposed spectroscopy using spinor condensates and fermions in unit filled optical lattices .",
    "we showed that particle losses close to the feshbach resonance limits the sensitivity in the bec implementation , and thus the use of very narrow feshbach resonances and atomic species with a large spin relaxation time are required to optimize the sensitivity of the method .",
    "our implementation of the scheme in optical lattice set - ups is insensitive to atomic losses but on the other is limited by the slow dynamics .",
    "regardless of such problems , the proposed spectroscopy is a new scheme that takes advantages of many - particle entanglement to perform high precision measurements of the interaction parameters in spin mixtures .",
    "we are optimistic that emerging technology in optical and magnetic feshbach resonances might overcome the current experimental limitations in such systems or that new developments in the field might provide alternative set - ups for the experimental application of the presented method and make of it an useful spectroscopic technique .",
