    ", we discuss our observations by comparing the results of xrd  @xcite to discriminate the electronic correlation in this quarter - filled q1d system from trivial electrostatic interactions stemming from the anion ordering .",

    "_ found the loss of the inversion symmetry in the unit cell below @xmath3 , and proposed the configuration of scn anions schematically represented by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : aoxray ] .",
    "they argued that the anions alternately establish long and short contacts along the @xmath30- ( chain ) direction .",
    "therefore , much more effect on the charge density at the inner carbon site by the variation of the distance between the molecule and anion is expected than that at the outer site .",
    "indeed , our result of @xmath35 that follows the uniform susceptibility shows the smaller effect on the charge density at the outer carbon site at @xmath3 . on the other hand , the remarkable decrease of @xmath34 between 160 k and 145 k , and being three times as large as @xmath34 of @xmath49 shows that the charge disproportionation takes place exclusively at the inner carbon sites .",
    "therefore , the charge transfer can be considered to take place from the one inner carbon site ( @xmath31 ) to the other one ( site @xmath4 ) triggered by anion ordering .",
    "this argument leads to the possible _ intra - molecular _ charge disproportionation in contrast to ( tmttf)@xmath2@xmath51f@xmath10 which has spin - peierls ground states .",
    "if we assume that the dominating source to modify the charge densities at the inner carbon sites is the electrostatic interaction between the molecules and anions , it is expected that the carbon site which is closer to the anion ( @xmath4 in fig .",

    "[ sec : t1 ] , the lines @xmath4 and @xmath33 are assigned to the same carbon site because of the same magnitudes of the spin densities for both lines .",
    "we discuss here the disappearance of the line @xmath4 ( @xmath33 ) between 130 k and 100 k.    the loss of the nmr intensity observed for the line @xmath4 is known as a `` wipeout '' phenomenon when the electronic state is inhomogeneous causing broadening of the nmr spectra and shortening of the spin echo decay time .",

    "@xcite for the q1d cuprates , the intensity of the cu nmr spectra of the hole - doped cu@xmath2o@xmath55 two - leg ladder , sr@xmath56ca@xmath53cu@xmath57o@xmath58 , decreases in the semiconducting temperature regime in lowering temperature .",
    "@xcite in these cases , the shortening of the spin echo decay time ( @xmath59 ) due to the strong spin fluctuation in the vicinity of charge stripes or the slow fluctuation of the electric field gradients generates the wipeout of the nmr spectra . in the present study ,",
    "the most plausible origin of the wipeout is also the shortening of the spin echo decay time due to the slowing down of charge fluctuations because the frequency shift and the linewidth of the nmr spectra diverges at around 120 k. since it is known that @xmath60 takes a maximum value when the inverse of the correlation time of electronic fluctuations is close to the second moment of the nmr spectrum , the fluctuation frequency of the local field is confirmed to be less than 50 khz below 120 k.  @xcite    it is noteworthy that the critical phenomenon observed for the site @xmath4 occurs at a much lower temperature than @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , no significant anomaly in the macroscopic measurements such as resistivity and uniform susceptibility is reported around 120 k so far , and @xmath35 that follows the uniform susceptibility remains intact around this temperature .",
    "therefore the significant slowing down of the electronic charges may be due to the local electronic interactions .",
    "it is reported that the superspot at @xmath61 in the reciprocal space appears at 160 k , and the intensity at this point continues to increase almost linearly down to 50 k according to xrd .",
    "@xcite between 160 k and 50 k where wide distribution remains in the displacements of anions from the original position or the partial ordering with a finite correlation length , the electrostatic interaction between the anions and tmttf molecules would lead to disordered charge densities at site @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the observation of the activated @xmath28 dependence with multi - barriers in @xmath34 reveals random potentials at site @xmath31 . since the energy scale of xrd is much higher than the larmor frequency ( @xmath62 100 mhz ) , our observation of the divergence of the linewidth observed at an intermediate temperature between the onset and saturating temperature for the anion ordering shows that it can not be concluded that the only source of the strong slowing down of the local charge fluctuation at site @xmath4 is the electrostatic coupling between the anions and molecules .",
    "instead , it is plausible that some source that can compete with the disordered electronic state generates a frustration at the carbon site below @xmath3 .",
    "it is recently argued that some members of the ( tmttf)@xmath2__x _ _ family have a charge disproportionated phase of @xmath8-cdw in the semiconducting temperature regime . chow _",
    "_ found the splitting of @xmath0c nmr spectra for ( tmttf)@xmath2__m__f@xmath63 ( @xmath51=as , p ) , which have the spin - peierls ground state .",
    "@xcite this charge ordering phenomenon is regarded as a result of the strong coulomb repulsive interaction between the electrons that has spin 1/2 through the dimerization of tmttf molecules .",
    "the observation of the spin - peierls ground state in ( tmttf)@xmath5__m__f@xmath63 evidences the strong dimerization in these materials . however , the xrd experiments for the scn salts do not show an obvious superstructure along the chain direction , resulting in weak dimerization at most .  @xcite our observation of the charge disproportionation with @xmath8-cdw like charge configuration is the first one in this weakly dimerized , quarter - filled q1d tmttf material .    the cdw instability which has the commensurate wavelength originated from the electronic correlation as discussed for the electronic state of ( tmttf)@xmath5__m__f@xmath63 may be a candidate that competes with the disordered local electronic state at the inner carbon sites in the intermediate temperature range of imperfect anion ordering .",
    "we should mention that there still remains an open question on the mechanism of the competition between the local activation gap generated by the anion ordering and the instability toward the cdw originated from the electronic correlation among the molecules .",
    "theoretical studies that include the interactions between the anions and molecules are expected .",
    "we measured the @xmath0c nmr spectra and nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath1 for ( tmttf)@xmath2scn that has a linear anion .",
    "the appearance of the new inhomogeneous line ( line @xmath4 ) below the anion ordering temperature ( @xmath3 ) reveals that the electronic charges are disproportionated in this material .",
    "in contrast to ( tmttf)@xmath2__m__f@xmath10 that have spin - peierls ground states , the charge transfer in this material leads to the local fluctuations of electronic charges which induces the different @xmath28 dependences in the frequency shifts and @xmath1 . of these , the strong decrease of @xmath1 for the charge donating site ( site @xmath31 ) in lowering temperature revealed an activation gap for spin excitations and the inhomogeneous electronic state possibly due to the wide distribution of the displacements from the original position of the anions as observed by xrd .",
    "these results are consistent with the wavevector of anion ordering which naturally leads to @xmath8-cdw like charge disproportionation by assuming the electrostatic interaction between the anions and molecules .    however , our observation of the divergence of the frequency shift and the linewidth of the spectra of the charge - accepting site @xmath4 indicating the gradual slowing down of the local electronic charges at a much lower temperature than @xmath3 needs other source than the trivial electrostatic interaction between the anions and molecules .",

    "<S> the results of @xmath0c nmr spectra and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath1 for the quasi - one - dimensional quarter - filled organic material ( tmttf)@xmath2scn are presented . </S>",
    "<S> a new inhomogeneous line appears below the anion ordering temperature ( @xmath3 ) , below which the intensity of the distinct line owing to the inner carbon site from the inversion center is halved . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the charge transfer ( disproportionation ) occurs from one inner carbon site to the other inner site exclusively within one unit cell triggered by anion ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 for the charge - donating inner site shows activated temperature dependence below @xmath3 , although @xmath1 for the outer carbon decreases much more moderately in lowering temperature as has been discussed in weakly interacting one dimensional conductors . </S>",
    "<S> our observation of the local gap for the spin excitation generated by anion ordering is consistent with the simple model assuming only the electrostatic interaction between the inner carbon sites and ordered anions , which is known to be much closer to the inner sites than to the outer sites . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we reveal that only the electrostatic interaction between the anions and molecules is insufficient to reproduce the observed divergence of the frequency shift and the linewidth of the inhomogeneous line stemming from the charge - accepting inner site at a much lower temperature than @xmath3 . </S>"
