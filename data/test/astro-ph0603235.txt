    "a decade of extrasolar planet discoveries has shown that the process of planet formation is more complex than originally anticipated .",
    "it leads to a remarkable diversity of planetary configurations , ranging from migrating hot jupiters to eccentric giant planets , as well as our own `` circular '' solar system . following these discoveries ,",
    "progress has been made in understanding planet formation , but the theory is still incomplete ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the leading scenario for the formation of giant planets is the core accretion mechanism .",
    "icy planetesimals located beyond the snow line in their host disk collide repeatedly to grow a core with a modest gaseous atmosphere .",
    "if this core succeeds in reaching a critical mass of a few tens of earth masses , runaway accretion of a massive gaseous envelope proceeds and leads , ultimately , to the formation of a gaseous giant planet @xcite .",
    "some evidence supporting this scenario has emerged in recent years , in the form of a metallicity trend for stars hosting planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the discovery of a high density hot jupiter @xcite and that of a surprisingly low - mass micro - lensing planet @xcite .",
    "however , a long - standing difficulty for the core accretion scenario , which has not yet been fully elucidated , is the fact that the timescale required to build - up critical core masses and thus large gaseous envelopes ( @xmath0-@xmath1  yr ) is comparable to the lifetimes of proto - planetary disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "orbital migration adds a layer of complication to theories of planet formation . as a result of gravitational interactions with their gaseous disk @xcite , the orbits of planets in the terrestrial mass range",
    "are predicted to decay on timescales ( @xmath2  yr ) short compared to disk lifetimes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "migration is slower for planets of much smaller or much larger masses : in the first case because the torque causing migration is quadratic in planet mass , and in the second case because the planet opens a gap and then migrates on the disk s accretion timescale , which can be comparable to its lifetime . while it is possible or probable that many terrestrial planets form by agglomeration of smaller bodies after the gas is gone , this is not an option for the solid cores of jovian planets since , in the core accretion scenario , the cores must form before the gaseous envelopes can be accreted .",
    "the prevalence of jovian planets with orbital periods of only a few days deepens the mystery as it suggests that these planets did migrate but stopped short of merging with their stars at orbital radii where even the accretion timescale would seem to have been very short ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    analytic calculations and most hydro - dynamical simulations of migration usually assume a disk that is laminar apart from the waves and shocks excited by the planet itself ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "but the effective viscosity of disks probably involves turbulence .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n2005 ) have found in 3d simulations of magneto - rotational turbulence that the instantaneous torque exerted on a planet in the terrestrial mass range is subject to fluctuations many times its mean value , apparently caused by turbulent density fluctuations in the planet s vicinity .",
    "in fact , no obvious secular decay manifests itself in the orbits of planets with mass @xmath3 , although because the simulations are limited to @xmath4 planetary orbits",
    " compare @xmath5 for jupiter during the lifetime of the proto - solar nebula  and the predicted decay in semimajor axis is @xmath6 over this period , the expected secular trend might be difficult to discern amid the fluctuations .",
    "the possibility that planetary torques are stochastic raises several issues :    1 .",
    "is the time - averaged torque exerted on a planet of a given angular momentum affected ?",
    "n2005 finds that turbulence excites planetary eccentricity , @xmath7 . in linear theory",
    ", eccentricity allows the planet to interact with the disk at additional resonances that do not couple to circular orbits @xcite .",
    "also , at second and higher orders in @xmath7 , the radial positions of the original resonances shift if one compares eccentric and circular orbits at fixed angular momentum ; they do not shift at fixed orbital energy since keplerian energies and mean motions vary only with semi - major axis .",
    "thus for eccentric planets , one must distinguish the rate of change of the planetary angular momentum ( torque ) from the rate of change of orbital energy .",
    "smoothing of the planetary potential along epicycles tends to reduce the strength of the highest-@xmath8 lindblad resonances that dominate the torque on circular orbits .",
    "all of these perturbative effects are expected to become significant when @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the disk thickness .",
    "planets of terrestrial mass achieved such eccentricities in n2005 s simulations . on the other hand , at about the same eccentricity the epicyclic velocities become supersonic , which will probably raise significant shocks , a non - perturbative effect .",
    "thus both the sign and magnitude of the changes in the mean torque due to turbulently excited eccentricity are unclear .",
    "we are not aware of any systematic investigation of this issue , nor have we attempted one . throughout this paper ,",
    "we treat the planetary orbit as circular .",
    "2 .   even for circular orbits , stochastic changes in semi - major axis on timescales",
    "long compared to the period but short compared to the nominal migration time may significantly alter the mean orbital lifetime .",
    "this is particularly likely when the local mean torque varies strongly with radius , as it does in the alpha disks studied by @xcite . because of rapid changes in opacity in certain temperature regimes , the disks exhibit sharp peaks in the local migration timescale . under laminar conditions ,",
    "orbital lifetimes can be dominated by the time required to drift across these peaks .",
    "turbulent fluctuations in the torque , however , could allow planets to `` jump over '' the peaks , thus shortening the lifetime .",
    "on the other hand , diffusion to large radii where the local migration time is long might prolong the orbital lifetime .",
    "3 .   finally , orbital diffusion should allow the occasional planet to survive much longer than the mean lifetime defined by its birthplace .",
    "if sufficiently many planets are formed , this might in principle help to reconcile theoretical predictions of rapid _ mean _ migration with the observations at least of the longer - period planets ( though it seems unlikely to explain hot jupiters ) .",
    "the methods adopted in this paper allow us to explore the second and third issues above , but not the first . in ",
    "[ sec : fp ] , we develop a simple advection - diffusion or fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution function of planetary orbital angular momentum in the presence of torque fluctuations .",

    "mean _ migration rate .",
    "that is to say , one can rewrite the flux in eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) as @xmath49 so that @xmath50 contributes to the advection term .",
    "we have tried to abstract a value and scaling for @xmath22 from the mhd simulations of n2005 ; the results of @xcite were difficult to translate into our framework .",
    "nelson reports that the typical timescale of fluctuations in @xmath51 is of order half an orbital period .",
    "hence we take @xmath52    a direct estimate of the correlation function of the data suggests , however , that correlations may persist to much longer than an orbital period , and it is conceivable that the integral ( [ ddef ] ) for @xmath22 does not even exist ( nelson 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "if the correlation time does not exist , then the methods of this paper are inapplicable to migration .",
    "such long - term correlations imply a `` memory '' in the turbulence , presumably involving persistent structures in addition to the planet of interest : for example , long - lived vortices ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or of course other planets .",
    "pending further numerical evidence , we adopt as a working hypothesis that @xmath25 _ does _ exist but with uncertain magnitude .    to complete the diffusion coefficient",
    ", we require a parametrization of the variance of the fluctuating torque in terms of time - averaged disk properties .",
    "this entails some guesswork , as the simulations of n2005 and @xcite have explored only a limited range of disk models and planetary radii .",
    "a natural scale for the gravitational force exerted on the planet by the local gas is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the surface density of the disk .",
    "this is the force that the planet would feel if suspended just above the disk .",
    "the corresponding natural scale for the torque is @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , we postulate that the variance of the torque fluctuations is @xmath56 ^ 2}\\approx \\left(\\mathcal{c}_d\\times 2\\pi g\\bar\\sigma r_p m_p\\right)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a dimensionless coefficient depending upon the strength of the turbulence .",
    "since the parametrization ( [ amptorque ] ) underlies all of our results , it is worth more discussion .",
    "the turbulence is accompanied by density perturbations of r.m.s .",
    "amplitude @xmath58 on scale @xmath59 .",
    "an individual perturbation of this scale exerts a gravitational force per unit mass @xmath60 at distance @xmath61 if @xmath62 , and @xmath63 if @xmath64 . presuming that the forces from different perturbations add in quadrature , the mean - square force is dominated by the closest such perturbation , at @xmath65 , since the number of @xmath59-scale perturbations within distance @xmath61 increases more slowly with @xmath61 than the mean - square contribution from individual perturbations decreases : @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 , versus @xmath70 .",

    ". force due to scale @xmath59 is @xmath71 for @xmath62 and @xmath72 for @xmath64 .",
    "the contributions to @xmath22 from @xmath62 are probably unimportant because of the weighting by @xmath59 and because smaller scales are likely to have shorter correlation times .",
    "if the density power spectrum were as `` blue '' as white noise , @xmath73 , and if the correlation time @xmath74 , then there would be equal contributions from all scales @xmath75 , with the result that the total contribution from these scales would be larger than the contribution from @xmath76 by a logarithmic factor .",
    "in reality , the density power spectrum is surely red , since local magnetorotational ( henceforth mri ) simulations find that most of the turbulent magnetic and kinetic energy resides at scales @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution to the force comes from scales @xmath77 . since @xmath78 in this regime , the total r.m.s .",
    "force fluctuation is proportional to the total r.m.s .",
    "surface - density fluctuation , @xmath79 .",
    "it remains to discuss how @xmath80 and hence @xmath81 may depend upon the strength of the turbulence .",
    "density fluctuations may arise from fluctuations in gas pressure or in entropy .",
    "local mri simulations indicate that @xmath82 @xcite , as might be expected from equipartition , since the internal energy per unit mass associated with a density fluctuation is @xmath83 . in a statistically steady accretion disk , the local thermal time @xmath84 , so if the correlation time of mechanical fluctuations is @xmath85 , entropy fluctuations due to dissipation are expected to be at most @xmath86 .",
    "entropy fluctuations may also arise by advection of material in the presence of a background entropy gradient , @xmath87 .",
    "the simulations cited above indicate that the turbulent reynolds stress scales with the magnetic stress so @xmath88 , and we assume that the largest displacements have frequencies @xmath89 , so the r.m.s .",
    "displacement @xmath90 in any direction .",
    "vertical and horizontal entropy gradients are likely to have scale lengths @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , which would seem to make vertical displacements more important .",
    "however , the azimuthal force , and hence torque , exerted by a mass element changes only at second order as it is displaced vertically through @xmath93 , so vertical displacements contribute at @xmath94 .",
    "radial displacements contribute at first order , @xmath95 .",
    "the vertically uniform disk of n2005 has a radial entropy gradient , since the sound speed is constant but the density is not ; however , since n2005 obtains @xmath96 ( in agreement with previous work ) , it happens that @xmath97 in these models , so that we can not distinguish between @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ".    it would be useful to calculate torque fluctuations in a variety of disk models with varying entropy gradients , thicknesses , and ( if possible ) strengths of turbulence .",
    "lacking such information , we provisionally assume @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is some function ( probably linear ) .",
    "this leads to the parametrization ( [ amptorque ] ) if @xmath102 is a universal constant .",
    "as will be seen , diffusion then dominates mean migration , _",
    "i.e. _ inward drift at the rate predicted for a laminar disk , in the outer parts of plausible disk models .",
    "if @xmath79 is also proportional to @xmath103 , diffusion becomes even more dominant in the outer parts of a flaring disk .",
    "n2005 reports that the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuating torque per unit planetary mass is @xmath104 in code units . in the same units , @xmath105 ( nelson 2005 , private communication ) ;",
    "the latter is independent of radius because @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 is taken as the reference value of the dimensionless factor in equation ( [ amptorque ] ) .    following eq .",
    "( [ tcorr ] ) , the diffusion coefficient @xmath22 is the product of the correlation time @xmath25 ( [ tcorrsim ] ) and the torque variance ( [ amptorque ] ) .",
    "both factors are uncertain , but within the framework of this advection - diffusion approach , they combine into a single parameter .",
    "we hope that future numerical simulations will refine our estimates of this parameter and , more importantly , test the validity of the scalings ( [ tcorrsim ] ) and ( [ amptorque ] ) .    for comparison , @xcite s expression for the mean lindblad torque density",
    ", @xmath108 leads to the scaling @xmath109 for consistency with our calibration of torque fluctuations , we also calibrate this relation against nelson s simulations of laminar disks , in which the type i torque per unit mass is @xmath110 in code units . the constant of proportionality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meantorque ] ) is then @xmath111 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : meantorque ] ) implies that the mean torque is always negative .",
    "this is fine for plausible power - law disks but might be misleading for alpha disks , where the surface density and temperature can be highly structured , allowing in principle for positive ( or at least much reduced ) @xmath11 at some radii .",
    "thus when modeling alpha disks we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : ward ] ) directly , as described in @xcite .",

    "some aspects of time - dependent evolution can also be determined analytically for this class of disk models . throughout this section ,",
    "all disk models are considered to be infinite in radius as well as steady . while unrealistic , this is technically convenient , and we are still able to identify results that are likely to be sensitive to the details of the outer boundary conditions : for example , the mean orbital lifetime . for reference ,",

    "[ fig:4dprop ] ) , but it is clear that the exact location of the transition from migration- to diffusion - dominated evolution depends on the proto - planetary disk model adopted , the value of the planet mass , and the normalization @xmath269 of the diffusion coefficient . nevertheless , the dominance of diffusion over migration in the outer regions of these disks is robust because @xmath289 tends to increase with radius in disk models of interest [ eq .",

    "secondly , as shown in panel iii , in a disk model with realistic opacities , sudden and non - monotonic variations in the value of @xmath283 at radii @xmath290 could complicate the orbital evolution of planets substantially , by stalling their migration as they reach the disk inner regions .",

    "[ fig:4dprop ] ) . consequently , even in disk regions where diffusion nominally dominates over migration in our models ( as measured by the ratio @xmath295 ) , this additional contribution due to radially inhomogeneous diffusion should still cause a rather significant effective advection of planets towards the star .",
    "we have studied two different types of time - dependent models for the diffusive migration of planets in proto - planetary disks , corresponding approximately to a continuous and a burst scenario for planet formation . in both cases , for the sake of clarity , the source of planets was localized , taking the form of a sharply peaked gaussian approximating the delta source function of eq .",

    "thus , at @xmath300 , the disks in panels i and iv are diffusion - dominated and the disks in panels ii and iii are migration - dominated .",
    "the distinction between diffusion - dominated and migration - dominated evolutions is most clearly illustrated by comparing panels  i and  iii . while the initial steady - state peaked distribution is eroded and advected for the most part in panel iii , with little diffusion at large radii , there is significantly more diffusion at large radii in panel i. that distinction is not as clear in the alpha disk models , however .",
    "note that , in both panels  ii and  iv , the initial steady - state distribution is strongly peaked not at the source radius , but at radii where migration stalls ( as seen from panel iii in fig .",
    "[ fig:4dprop ] ) .",
    "in addition , even though diffusion is more important in the model with @xmath264 in panel iv , the effect appears to be minor in smoothing out only slightly the same sharp distribution features as in panel ii .",
    "this is partly explained by the strong contribution of radially inhomogeneous diffusion to inward advection of planets , which is always important in our alpha disk models ( as explained in the previous subsection ) .",
    "even though diffusion is equally important at @xmath296 in the models of panel i and iv ( see @xmath301 in fig .  [ fig:4dprop ] ) , it is more inhomogeneous in the alpha disk model and thus promotes a significantly more efficient inward advection of planets .    our models with a burst of planet formation",

    "figure  [ fig:4spike ] shows the evolution of such distributions of earth - mass planets initially located at @xmath296 in the same four disk models as in fig .",
    "[ fig:4steady ] .",
    "as before , a comparison between the two mmsn models shows that the effects of diffusion are much more important in the model with @xmath304 ( panel i ) than in the one with @xmath298 ( panel iii ) .",
    "in particular , a sub - population of planets diffusing at large radii is clearly visible in panel i. on the contrary , while diffusion still acts to widen the initial distribution in panel iii , the dominant effect is a global advection of the distribution of planets .",
    "finally , in agreement with our previous results , figure  [ fig:4spike ] shows that the most significant feature of alpha disk models is the effect of rapid variations in the migration rates of planets , which causes them to stall at specific locations in the disk and results in time - varying peaks in the distributions of panels ii and iv . even though diffusion is comparatively as important in panels i and iv , at @xmath300 , its effects appear to be much less important in the alpha disk model of panel iv .",
    "we attribute this difference , once again , to the more inhomogeneous diffusion in alpha disk models , which contributes substantially to the inward advection of planets into regions of the disk where diffusion becomes gradually less important and the effects of stalling radii are felt more strongly .",

    "significant uncertainties exist .",
    "let us mention a few .",
    "we have focused our work on strictly circular orbits .",
    "we have assumed that the underlying proto - planetary disk structure does not evolve with time , and that the amplitude @xmath81 of surface - density fluctuations is constant with radius .",
    "we have assumed that torque fluctuations can simply be added to a laminar mean torque which is not modified by the turbulence .",
    "the laminar torque itself is calculated from a simple extension of the two - dimensional lindblad torque theory , which does not account for the role of corotation torques .    despite all these uncertainties",
    ", we believe that our results should be broadly valid , provided that turbulence and torque fluctuations in proto - planetary disks satisfy the various stochasticity criteria enunciated in  [ sec : fp ] . understanding better the nature of turbulence in proto - planetary disks and in particular indications for long - term correlations in mhd simulations may turn out to be crucial in this context .",
    "we would like to issue a plea to the simulation community to study these questions , and in particular , whether the dimensionless amplitude and correlation time of density and torque fluctuations depend only upon the strength of the turbulence ( _ via _",
    "@xmath102 ) or upon the thickness @xmath103 as well (  [ subsec : calib ] ) . the answers will matter both quantitatively ( in determining the relative importance of migration _ vs. _ diffusion in global models such as ours ) and qualitatively ( in justifying a fokker - planck approach or in falsifying it ) .",
    "we have seen that details of the protoplanetary disk structure ( mmsn _ vs. _ alpha disks ) do influence our results at the quantitative level .",
    "in that respect , the possibility that a magnetically layered structure with quiescent dead zones exists in weakly - ionized regions of proto - planetary disks @xcite may be important .",
    "indeed , the results of @xcite suggest that the nature of turbulence in dead zones differs qualitatively from that in mhd turbulent regions , perhaps leading to comparatively reduced torque fluctuations ( see also * ? ? ? * for other suggested effects of dead zones in planet formation scenarios ) .",
    "the general tendency for a fraction of planets to diffuse to large radii in proto - planetary disks may have consequences of some observational relevance .",
    "we note , for instance , that @xcite have looked into scenarios for outward planet migration in an attempt to explain observed structures in dust disks as resulting from perturbations by planets located at radii beyond those at which they are thought to be able to form . rather than invoking outward migration ,",
    "this may be expected in scenarios with a prominent role for diffusion , as illustrated by our various models .",
    "we thank richard nelson for help with understanding his simulations .",

    "<S> mean planet lifetimes can even be formally infinite ( e.g. in an infinite steady mmsn ) , though median lifetimes are always finite . </S>",
    "<S> surviving planets may linger near specific radii where the combined effects of advection and diffusion are minimized , or at large radii , depending on model specifics . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic nature of migration in turbulent disks challenges deterministic planet formation scenarios and suggests instead that a wide variety of planetary outcomes are possible from similar initial conditions . </S>",
