    "investigations of dynamical properties of fluid  fluid dispersions ( e.g. , emulsions @xcite and polymer blends @xcite ) require detailed understanding of the behavior of viscous drops in creeping flows .",
    "such understanding is also crucial in development of new drop - based microfluidic systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , drop dynamics at small reynolds numbers have been extensively studied experimentally @xcite , computationally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "these investigations revealed complex nonlinear drop dynamics resulting from the coupling between the drop shape and fluid flow .",
    "examples of nonlinear phenomena that occur under creeping - flow conditions include formation of self - similar neck regions during a drop breakup process @xcite , universal slow evolution of drops near the critical flow strength above which there are no stationary drop shapes @xcite , and existence of two branches of stable stationary shapes of highly viscous drops in two - dimensional stokes flows with nonzero vorticity @xcite .",
    "as revealed by the analysis presented by @xcite , there exists a flow - parameter range where a high - viscosity drop can either adopt a nearly spherical shape stabilized primarily by the rotational flow component or an elongated shape stabilized primarily by capillary forces .",
    "abrupt changes of the drop shape from one state to the other can be used in manipulation of emulsion micro - structure and for controlling the behavior of highly viscous drops in microfluidic devices . due to discontinuous changes of emulsion microstructure ,",
    "the bistable drop behavior may also significantly affect emulsion rheology .",
    "moreover , the mechanism of the bistability is of fundamental interest because of close analogies to the dynamics of vesicles @xcite and macromolecules @xcite in external flows .    due to the fundamental significance and because of potential applications ( such as those mentioned above ) it is important to explore the dynamics of highly viscous drops in linear flows with nonzero vorticity .",
    "however , the investigations presented by @xcite were limited to stationary drop shapes and stationary external flows . in the present study we focus on drop behavior in time - dependent flows .",
    "we elucidate the physical mechanism that give rise to the bistable drop behavior and examine the consequence of these mechanism for drop response to time variation of the fluid vorticity .",
    "the system dynamics is investigated via direct boundary - integral simulations @xcite and by using a small - deformation approach @xcite .",
    "in particular we show that the small - deformation equations with only several essential terms retained reproduce complex dynamical features of drop evolution that are associated with drop bistability .    to emphasize important aspects of the drop dynamics we consider three flow variation protocols . in the first protocol ,",
    "the vorticity is slowly increased and then decreased .",
    "we find that such quasistatic vorticity ramping gives access to both the elongated and compact , nearly spherical stationary drop shapes .",
    "the drop exhibits a hysteretic behavior , with transitions between the compact shape ( rotationally stabilized ) and elongated shape ( stabilized by capillary forces ) occurring at different values of the vorticity when it is slowly ramped up or down .    in the second protocol",
    ", the vorticity undergoes finite - frequency periodic oscillations .",
    "as expected , at low frequencies the drop behavior is quasistatic , with a hysteresis loop analogous to the one observed for linear ramping . at high frequencies the oscillations average out , and the drop undergoes small oscillations around the stationary shape corresponding to the average flow .",
    "however , at intermediate frequencies we find a much more complex behavior . in particular we show that there exists a frequency and amplitude domain where the drop response to the periodic forcing is chaotic .",
    "since in the creeping flow regime fluid motion is governed by the linear stokes equations , the nonlinear chaotic behavior of the drop stems entirely from the coupling of the drop shape to the fluid velocity .",
    "an analysis of drop motion in the chaotic domain indicates that the transition to chaos is associated with the existence of two stationary states observed in steady flow .    in our third flow - variation protocol",
    ", the vorticity of the imposed flow undergoes random changes .",
    "we observe , that the resulting statistical distribution of the drop length is bimodal in a certain regime of flow parameters , with two peaks around the drop length corresponding to the short and long stationary solutions .",
    "hence , we find that also in this problem the existence of two stationary states underpins drop behavior in a time - dependent flow .    in  [ viscous drop in linear flows ] the system considered in our paper is defined . the quasistatic hysteretic drop behavior is analyzed in ",

    "to illustrate the effect of the rotational component of the flow on the dynamics of a highly viscous drop we consider a system where the parameter @xmath17 is first slowly increased and then slowly decreased .",
    "we adopt here a linear ramping protocol where the vorticity is slowly ramped up from @xmath22 to @xmath37 and then ramped down back to zero .",
    "before the ramping occurs the flow is maintained at @xmath22 ( for 5% of the total ramping time ) to allow the drop to relax to the stationary shape in purely straining flow .",
    "this vorticity variation protocol is represented in the inset of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the evolution of the drop shape in this time - dependent flow is depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] represents the drop length @xmath35 , and figure [ fig:1 ] shows the drop angle @xmath38 ( measured anticlockwise from the axis @xmath26 ) ; both quantities are plotted versus the vorticity parameter @xmath17 . in our example , the drop viscosity is @xmath39 .",
    "the capillary number @xmath40 is below the critical value for drop breakup ( @xmath41 in 2d straining flow ) but it is sufficiently large to allow for a significant flow - induced drop deformation .",
    "the total ramping time is @xmath42 , so that the drop response to the flow variation is nearly quasistatic .",
    "the calculations were performed using the adaptive boundary - integral procedure developed by @xcite .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig:1 ] indicate that the drop response to the vorticity variation is hysteretic . at @xmath22 drop",
    "is elongated , and it is aligned with the extensional axis of the straining component of the flow ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath17 , the drop orientation slowly changes towards the symmetry axis @xmath26 ( @xmath44 ) , and the drop length slowly decreases . at a critical value of the vorticity parameter , @xmath45 ,",
    "a discontinuous change occurs : the drop length and the angle suddenly decrease .",
    "afterwards the drop is almost spherical and nearly aligned with the axis @xmath26 .",
    "when the direction of the vorticity change is reversed , the drop initially retraces its trajectory .",
    "however , the drop does not jump back to the elongated shape until the vorticity reaches the lower critical value @xmath46 .    the bistable drop behavior and the associated hysteretic shape evolution stem from the existence of two mechanisms that can stabilize a viscous drop in linear flows with rotation .",
    "namely , the drop can be stabilized by the capillary stresses ( which drive the drop towards the equilibrium spherical shape ) or by the vorticity flow component ( which rotates the drop out of the extensional axis of the straining component of the flow ) .    in a purely straining flow",
    "the drop assumes the interfacial - tension - stabilized elongated shape @xcite .",
    "the form of the drop results from the balance between drop deformation by the flow and drop relaxation due to the capillary forces .",
    "the deformation and relaxation occur on the respective time scales @xmath47 @xmath48 both of which are proportional the viscosity ratio @xmath49 .",
    "the drop deformation @xmath50 is determined by the time scale ratio @xmath51 and therefore it is independent of the viscosity ratio in the limit @xmath52 . in purely staining flows , the drop is oriented along the extensional axis @xmath23 .        for small values of @xmath17 ,",
    "the vorticity flow component produces an @xmath53 perturbation of the drop orientation .",
    "the corresponding decrease of the drop length is @xmath54 .",
    "however , a further drop rotation is arrested because the straining component of the flow produces hydrodynamic stresses that pull the elongated drop back towards the straining axis ( as illustrated in figure [ mechanism ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath55 internal circulation inside an elongated high - viscosity drop is weak , the drop in its stationary state behaves analogously to a rigid body whose equilibrium orientation results from the balance of the torques produced by the straining and rotational components of the external flow .",
    "the transition to the compact drop shape occurs when the vorticity flow component becomes too strong to be balanced . under such conditions ,",
    "a rigid body would undergo a transition to a periodic motion with continuous rotation in the clockwise direction .",
    "similarly , a drop also starts to continuously rotate when @xmath17 achieves the upper critical value @xmath56 .",
    "however , during the rotation the drop length decreases because the drop becomes misaligned with the extensional axis of the flow . as a result",
    ", the drop relaxes to a nearly spherical shape .    in this new , compact shape the fluid inside",
    "the drop circulates with the angular velocity @xmath57 that is nearly equal to the angular velocity of the external flow . within each period of rotation",
    "the drop undergoes a small deformation produced by the straining component of the external flow ( as schematically illustrated in figure [ mechanism ] ) .",
    "however , the deformation does not accumulate because it is constantly convected away by the rotational component of the flow .    since the rotation occurs on the time scale @xmath58 and the drop deforms on the much longer timescale , we find that the drop deformation @xmath59 is small for @xmath49 , consistent with the results shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "relation indicates that the deformation of the rotationally stabilized drop increases with the decreasing parameter @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath17 falls below the lower critical value @xmath60 , the hydrodynamic torque associated with the straining component of the flow acting on a slightly elongated drop becomes strong enough to reorient the drop along the straining axis and arrest further drop rotation .",
    "deformation thus starts to accumulate , the drop is stretched , and a transition to the interfacial - tension stabilized elongated state takes place .    as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , a drop in the compact , rotationally stabilized stationary state is nearly aligned with the symmetry axis of the applied flow @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior stems from the flow - reflection symmetry of stokes equations and the fact that the drop is stabilized by rotation rather than the capillary forces . in the absence of the capillary forces ( or in the limit of infinitely strong flow )",
    "the symmetry of stokes equations implies that the stationary drop shape is invariant with respect to flow reflection .",
    "hence , the shape is also invariant with respect to the corresponding transformation @xmath61 of the spatial coordinates ( and this symmetry corresponds to drop alignment in the @xmath26 direction ) .",
    "a perturbation due to the presence of the capillary stresses produces only a small asymmetry because the effect of capillary forces is insignificant for a nearly spherical drop .",

    "the results indicate that the size of the hysteresis loop is the largest for large values of @xmath29 and @xmath62 .",
    "when the capillary number is decreased , the upper critical vorticity parameter @xmath56 ( corresponding to the transition from the elongated to the compact drop ) decreases but the lower critical parameter @xmath63 remains nearly unaffected .",
    "in contrast , the viscosity ratio @xmath29 affects primarily the position of the lower critical parameter @xmath60 ( corresponding to the transition from the compact to the elongated drop ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the scaling relations and and the mechanism of drop bistability explained in  [ capillary and rotational stabilizing mechanisms ] .",
    "according to these relations the deformation of an elongated drop scales with @xmath62 and is independent of @xmath29 , while the deformation of a compact drop is independent of @xmath62 and scales with @xmath64 .",
    "we recall that the critical states corresponding to the transitions between the elongated and compact drop shapes correspond to the points where the maximal torque @xmath65 exerted by the extensional component of the flow on the drop just before the transition marginally balances the torque @xmath66 exerted by the vorticity flow component .",

    "we note that for @xmath72 ( see figure [ drop response for different ca and lambda ] ) the hysteretic drop behavior is not observed .",
