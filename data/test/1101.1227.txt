    "at the end of the dark age of the universe , the cosmic dawn was heralded by the birth of the first stars and galaxies .",
    "the nature of these first objects is still far from being well understood . from the theory of star formation from primordial gas ,",
    "the first stars are believed to be very massive , with masses of the order of @xmath2 , given the limited cooling of molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this depends on fragmentation in a cosmological minihalo , ionization prior to the onset of gravitational collapse , and the accretion rate from the cloud envelope @xcite , and it seems possible to form lower - mass stars ( @xmath3 ) from primordial gas in recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the primordial stars with initial masses of @xmath4 explode as pair instability supernovae ( pisne ) @xcite . in terms of chemical abundances ,",
    "however , no observational signature for the existence of pisne has been detected .",
    "chemical enrichment from the first generation of stars has mainly been studied with extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath5% of emp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xcite show carbon enhancement relative to iron ( [ c / fe ] @xmath7 ) ; this is also the case for the three hyper / ultra metal - poor stars known , with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 .",
    "such stars are collectively known as carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars , and are further subdivided as cemp - s and cemp - no stars depending on whether they exhibit or not an enhancement in the abundances of slow neutron capture elements such as barium .",
    "the abundance patterns of emp stars are explained with one of , or the combination of , four enrichment sources : ( 1 ) core - collapse supernovae @xcite , ( 2 ) rotating massive stars @xcite , ( 3 ) asymptotic giant blanch ( agb ) stars in binary systems @xcite , or ( 4 ) interstellar accretion @xcite .",
    "these enrichment sources have distinct signatures , so that it should be possible to distinguish between them by comparing the observed elemental abundances with theoretical calculations of nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "the high [ c / fe ] can be explained with the mass transfer from agb stars in binary systems , the mass loss from rotating massive stars , and a single core - collapse supernova forming a black hole .",
    "the ba enhancement can be explained by agb stars and possibly by rotating massive stars @xcite .",
    "however , iron - peak elements have to come from supernovae . the effect of interstellar accretion has not been studied with hydrodynamical simulations , but is observationally estimated to be negligible @xcite .",
    "the binarity of cemp stars has been studied by monitoring radial velocity variations .",
    "a signature of binarity is seen statistically for possibly all cemp - s stars @xcite , but the binary fraction of cemp - no stars seems to be much lower @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the binarity is not seen for the three stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite were the first to show that the observed abundance pattern from c to zn can be well reproduced with the enrichment from a single core - collapse supernova that leaves behind a relatively massive black hole , under the assumption of inhomogeneous chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the n abundance can be as large as observed with enhanced mixing between h and he layers during the hydrostatic stellar evolution .",
    "the observations of very metal - poor damped lyman @xmath0 ( dla ) systems have opened a new window to study the chemical enrichment of the universe by the first generations of stars .",
    "dlas are quasar absorbers defined by their high column density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath9(hi)/@xmath10 .",
    "they appear to sample a range of galaxy types , from the extended hi disks of galaxies , to smaller subgalactic size haloes , as well as smaller hi clouds within larger galaxies @xcite .",
    "large scale surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey , have increased ten - fold the number of known dlas , which now number in excess of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "follow - up high resolution spectroscopy of the most metal - poor dlas is of particular interest , since the gas they trace may have been enriched by very few generations of stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , measuring elemental abundances in dlas is straightforward ; the only potential complications are line saturation and dust depletion and both effects are of much reduced importance for metallicities @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the chemical evolution of such systems is rather simple , whereas in more chemically evolved systems , there are uncertainties in the star formation history , gas inflow and outflow , large contributions from agb stars and type ia supernovae , with the result that the signatures of the first stars can be easily washed out .    thus , if the most metal - poor dlas hold the key to unravelling the chemical enrichment from the first stars , it is of great interest to compare their observed abundance patterns with the nucleosynthesis yields of metal - free stars .",
    "@xcite recently reported such a dla with [ fe / h ] @xmath13 , which exhibits a strong carbon enhancement relative to all other available elements , including [ c / fe ] @xmath14 .",
    "this reminds us of the cemp stars in the solar neighborhood . in this letter",
    ", we compare the elemental abundance pattern of the c - rich dla with the nucleosynthesis yields of both core - collapse and pair - instability supernovae (  2 ) . in  3 we give a more general discussion of the chemical enrichment of the universe by the first generation of stars .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in  4 .",
    "in stars with initial masses of @xmath15 , the iron core undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of the star s life .",
    "if sufficient amount of the released gravitational energy is transported to the outgoing shock wave , a supernova explosion occurs .",
    "the mechanism of core - collapse explosion and formation of a black hole remnant is still uncertain , although a few groups have presented feasible calculations of exploding supernovae ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "thus , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have calculated nucleosynthesis yields by promptly exploding the progenitor model without calculating further collapse and bounce , and by applying mixing - fallback . during the supernova explosion , the elements synthesized in different stellar layers mix and a large fraction of this mixed material falls back onto the remnant black hole",
    "physically , such a mixing - fallback process can be caused not only by the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite but also by a jet - induced explosion @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we calculate nucleosynthesis yields with two new models of faint core - collapse supernovae applying different mixing - fallback parameters .     the elemental abundance pattern of the metal - poor c - rich dla ( filled circles ) and peculiar dla ( open circles ) .",
    "the solid and short - dashed lines show the nucleosynthesis yields of faint core - collapse supernovae from @xmath16 stars with mixing - fallback .",
    "the dotted line is for pair - instability supernovae from @xmath17 stars .",
    ", width=328 ]    figure [ fig : dla ] shows their elemental abundance ratios from c to zn relative to fe .",
    "we adopt the progenitor star model from @xcite for an initial mass of @xmath18 and metallicity @xmath19 .",
    "we implement two cases with different explosion energies : @xmath20 erg ( supernova ( sn ) , solid line ) and @xmath21 erg ( hypernova ( hn ) , short - dashed line ) .",
    "an efficient mixing - fallback is adopted in both models : the mixing region of ejecta is assumed to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the ejection fraction of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the resultant black hole masses are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . the ejected fe masses are as small as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and thus correspond to faint supernovae such as sn1997d . for comparison , @xmath30 for normal supernovae and @xmath31 for normal hypernovae in ( hereafter k06 , * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter dependencies of elemental abundance ratios can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the abundances of odd - z elements are lower than those of the @xmath0 elements .",
    "this odd - even effect with the order of @xmath32 dex is realized for primordial supernovae in general , and is consistent with observations of emp stars in the galactic halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the yields of odd - z elements are enhanced by the surplus of neutrons in @xmath33ne , and @xmath33ne is transformed from @xmath34n during he - burning .",
    "the absence of seed cno elements in the progenitor stars results in smaller amounts of odd - z elements .",
    "this metallicity effect gives excellent agreement with the decreasing trends of [ ( na , al , cu)/fe ] toward lower metallicity in the solar neighborhood ( k06 ) .",
    "the metallicity effect is stronger for na , al , sc , and cu than for p , cl , k , v , mn , and co. * c and n are synthesized in the outermost region of the ejecta .",
    "thus , the [ c / fe ] ratio is higher for smaller ejection of fe .",
    "[ n / fe ] depends on the initial metallicity and mixing during the stellar evolution . * @xmath0 elements such as o , mg , si , and s are synthesized in the outer regions of the ejecta",
    ". [ o / fe ] depends both on the explosion energy and mixing - fallback , and thus it is not possible to put a constraint on the explosion energy only from [ o / fe ] . since mg is more sensitive to the explosion energy , [ mg / fe ] may give a clue to solve this degeneracy .",
    "si and s are synthesized in more inner regions than o , and significant amounts of si and s fallback . *",
    "zn , co , and v are synthesized in the deep complete si - burning region together with @xmath35% of fe .",
    "[ ( co , zn)/fe ] @xmath36 are realized in high energy explosions with mixing - fallback @xcite ; neutrino interactions could enhance [ zn / fe ] @xcite but not [ co / fe ] @xcite .",
    "* cr and mn are mainly synthesized in the incomplete si - burning region .",
    "[ cr / fe ] does not vary very much for these models ; cr abundance does not depend very much on parameters such as the electron fraction and entropy , and [ cr / fe ] can not be smaller with smaller @xmath37 or larger @xmath38 .",
    "larger @xmath37 can give larger [ cr / fe ] and smaller [ ( co , zn)/fe ] , but such abundance pattern is not consistent with the emp observations .",
    "therefore , in galactic chemical evolution models , [ cr / fe ] is almost constant over a wide range of [ fe / h ] .",
    "this has been a problem when comparing with the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but now is consistent if nlte effects are taken into account , as shown in k06 .",
    "we now compare these model calculations with the available abundance measurements in the extremely metal - poor dla reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* filled circles ) .",
    "this dla was originally identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectrum of the qso j0035@xmath390918 .",
    "follow - up high resolution spectroscopy indicated @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 , [ fe / h ] @xmath43 , and a pronounced carbon enhancement [ c / fe]@xmath14 .    *",
    "the observed [ c / fe ] ratio is well reproduced with our faint sn / hn models .",
    "low - mass agb stars ( @xmath44 ) can also provide such high [ c / fe ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , such low - mass stars are unlikely to contribute at the redshift of the c - rich dla . with the star formation history in the solar neighborhood",
    ", [ c / fe ] reaches the maximum value at @xmath45 due to the agb contribution @xcite . *",
    "the [ o / fe ] ratio is higher than for non - faint supernovae ( [ o / fe ] @xmath46 for @xmath16 in k06 ) and is consistent with the faint sn model because of the smaller ejected fe mass .",
    "* the [ ( si , s)/fe ] ratios are similar to those of non - faint supernovae , and also consistent with the faint sn / hn models . *",
    "the low al abundance strongly suggests that the enrichment source is not pop ii supernovae but primordial supernovae . even for @xmath47 , [ al / fe ] is larger than @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( k06 ) .",
    "* the low n abundance is also consistent with the faint sn / hn models , and the high [ c / n ] ratio can not be explained with mass loss from rotating massive stars @xcite or intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath50 ) .    in order to discuss the detailed explosion mechanism of the supernova ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain the elemental abundances of iron - peak elements .",
    "for the c - rich dla , because of the low metallicity , it is impossible to detect heavier elements than s except for fe .",
    "however , the abundance profiling approach can be used for other absorption systems with peculiar abundance patterns , because such systems have presumably been enriched by only a small number of supernovae . in figure [ fig : dla ]",
    "we overplot ( open circles ) the element abundances recently reported by @xcite for the @xmath51 dla in front of the gravitationally lensed quasar um637a .",
    "this dla , which has @xmath52 and [ fe / h ] @xmath53 , exhibits a different abundance pattern from other dlas with similar metallicities and also from the average population of galactic metal - poor stars .",
    "in particular , ti , ni , and zn are deficient relative to fe ( see fig . 11 and 12 in @xcite ) .    we show that this abundance pattern can also be explained with faint supernovae .",
    "the normal [ ( si , s)/fe ] ratios are consistent with the supernova scenario .",
    "the low al abundance strongly suggests that the enrichment source is primordial supernovae .",
    "the observed [ zn / fe ] ratio is more consistent with the faint sn model ( solid line ) than the faint hn model ( dashed line ) or non - faint supernovae without mixing - fallback ( [ zn / fe ] @xmath54 in k06 ) .",
    "this is also supported by the observed [ ni / fe ] .",
    "[ cr / fe ] is consistent with both supernova models .",
    "we should note that there is a problem in the ti nucleosynthesis yields ( k06 ) , and we do not include ti in the abundance profiling . at this metallicity , however , there is no information on c enhancement in the dla observations since c line is saturated .",
    "therefore , it is uncertain how efficient the mixing - fallback is .",
    "in fact , the observed abundances can be explained with medium mixing - fallback of non - faint supernovae . in this case , the ejected fe mass is larger , which may be consistent with the observed metallicity , and thus [ c / fe ] is lower than for the c - rich dla .    in figure [",
    "fig : dla ] the dotted line is for the nucleosynthesis yields of the pisn of a @xmath55 star , which are taken from @xcite .",
    "the primordial stars with initial masses of @xmath56 enter into the electron - positron pair instability region during the central oxygen - burning stages and contract quasi - dynamically .",
    "then the central temperature increases , central oxygen burning takes place explosively , and the generated nuclear energy is large enough to disrupt the stars completely without leaving compact remnants . compared with core - collapse supernovae",

    "all of these characteristics disagree with the observed elemental abundances of these metal - poor dlas . even at high - redshift",
    ", there is no signature of the existence of pisne .",
    "the [ si / c ] for pisne is as large as @xmath61 , which is also inconsistent with the observational estimate in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( [ si / c ] @xmath62 , @xcite ) .",

    "we have shown that the enrichment source of the extremely metal - poor dla is very likely a primordial supernova that is faint as a result of mixing - fallback to form a @xmath65 black hole .",
    "it is interesting that the observed dla abundance is very similar to those of emp stars in the solar neighborhood including the ultra metal - poor star he0557 - 4840 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath66 , [ c / fe ] @xmath67 , @xcite ) and bd+44@xmath68493 @xcite . without rotation , the chemical enrichment from very massive stars ( @xmath69 )",
    "is very small because the central part is supposed to fall onto the black hole . in the early stages of galaxy formation ,",
    "chemical enrichment is likely to be driven by core - collapse supernovae from @xmath1 stars , although the mass range depends on the rotation .",
    "how did the first supernova enrich the first galaxy ? in our supernova scenario , we assume that the first supernova occurs in a primordial gas cloud with the total mass of @xmath70 . in hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , the interstellar medium ( ism ) is ionized by the supernova explosion , and the hi mass rapidly decreases .",
    "afterwards , the hi mass slightly increases due to the recombination , and then decreases due to galactic mass - outflow . some of the ism could have the hi column density of @xmath71 and could be observed as dlas .",
    "the observable hi regions could have @xmath72 @xmath73 , although the hi mass highly depends on the total mass of the galaxy , the radial density profile , and the inhomogeneity of the ism . with our faint supernova models ,",
    "the ejected c mass is @xmath74 , which is roughly consistent with the observed c - rich dla . in @xcite , the masses of carbon and neutral gas of the c - rich dla",
    "are estimated as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are consistent with our scenario if @xmath77 .    are there any signatures of the first stars in other metal - poor systems ?",
    "for globular cluster systems ( gcss ) , the present stellar mass and half - light radius are @xmath78 and @xmath79 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are expected . as seen in the observed color - magnitude diagrams @xcite",
    ", star formation takes place slowly with a very low rate , and thus the ism is likely to be inhomogeneous .",
    "the elemental abundance pattern can be used for the abundance profiling .",
    "in fact , a few emp stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath88 in dsphs do show carbon enhancement @xcite , which suggests a contribution from faint supernovae .",
    "also in the outer halo of the milky way galaxy , three stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath89 do show [ c / fe ] @xmath90 ( beers 2010 , private communication ) ; such stars may be disrupted from dsphs .",
    "in the early stages of chemical enrichment , the interstellar medium is supposed to be highly inhomogeneous , so that the properties of the first objects can be directly extracted from the comparison between the observed elemental abundances and nucleosynthesis yields .",
    "we have shown that the observed abundance pattern of the very metal - poor c - rich dla is in excellent agreement with the nucleosynthesis yields of a primordial star that explodes as a faint core - collapse supernova owing to the efficient mixing and fallback .",
    "the nucleosynthesis yields of pisne are not consistent with the observation .",
    "the contribution from rotating massive stars seems to be small because of the lack of n enhancement .",
    "the contribution from agb stars should be very small because of the n abundance and of the enrichment timescale .",
    "since the dla abundances reflect the chemical enrichment in gas - phase , the binary or accretion scenarios of the emp stars do not work .",
    "thus , we conclude that enrichment by primordial supernovae is the best solution to explain the abundance pattern of the c - rich dla .",
    "the abundance pattern of the c - rich dla is similar to those of emp stars such as the ultra metal - poor star he0557 - 4840 .",
    "some of emp stars in dsphs and the galactic outer halo also show similar carbon enhancement at [ fe / h ] @xmath91 .",
