    "since its discovery fifty years ago @xcite anderson localization has remained a very active field of research ( see for instance the reviews @xcite ) . according to the scaling theory @xcite , there is no delocalized phase in dimensions @xmath20 , whereas there exists a localization / delocalization at finite disorder in dimension @xmath21 .",
    "to get some insight into this type of transition , it is natural to consider anderson localization on the cayley tree ( or bethe lattice ) which is expected to represent some mean - field limit .",
    "the tight - binding anderson model on the cayley tree has been thus studied by various authors . in @xcite , the recursion equation for",
    "the self - energy has been studied to establish the mobility edge as the limit of stability of localized states . in @xcite , the exponent @xmath19 governing the divergence of the localization length",
    "was shown to be @xmath22 . in @xcite ,",
    "the supersymmetric formalism has been used to predict the critical behavior of some disorder - averaged observables ( see also @xcite where similar results have been obtained for the case where anderson tight - binding model is replaced by a non - linear @xmath23-model ) . in @xcite , the problem was reformulated in terms of recursions on riccati variables to obtain weak - disorder expansions .",
    "other studies have focused on random - scattering models on the cayley tree @xcite .",
    "more recently , the interest in anderson localization on the cayley tree has been revived by the question of many - body localization @xcite , because the geometry of the fock space of many - body states was argued to be similar to a cayley tree @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the anderson tight binding model on the cayley tree already studied in @xcite and we study numerically the statistical properties of landauer transmission and eigenstates as a function of the disorder strength @xmath0 and of the number @xmath1 of generations .",
    "we find that several probability distributions propagate as traveling waves with a fixed shape , as the number @xmath1 of tree generations grows .",
    "the fact that traveling waves appear in disordered models defined on trees has been discovered by derrida and spohn @xcite on the specific example of the directed polymer in a random medium and was then found in various models @xcite . for the case of anderson localization on trees , the analysis of @xcite concerning",
    "the distribution of the self - energy in the localized phase is actually a traveling wave analysis ( see appendix a for more details ) , although it is not explicitly mentioned in these terms in @xcite .",
    "the fact that traveling waves occur has been explicitly seen in the numerical study of the transmission distribution for a random - scattering model on the cayley tree ( see fig . 8b of @xcite ) and has been found within the supersymmetric formalism @xcite . in the field of traveling waves and front propagation",
    "( see the reviews @xcite ) , there exists an essential separation between two classes : in pulled fronts , the velocity is determined by the form of the tail of the front and thus by the appropriate linearized equation in the tail region , whereas in pushed fronts , the velocity is determined by the bulk properties and thus by the non - linear dynamics in the bulk region .",
    "it turns out that for disordered systems defined on trees , the traveling waves that appear usually correspond to cases where it is the tail of the probability distribution that determines the velocity @xcite .",
    "in particular for anderson localization on the cayley tree , the traveling wave propagation is also determined by the tails @xcite . from this traveling wave point of view",
    ", the localization / delocalization anderson transition thus represents a traveling / non - traveling critical point .",
    "such a traveling / non - traveling phase transition for a branching random walk in the presence of a moving absorbing wall has been studied recently in @xcite and we find here very similar behaviors in the critical region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ trans ] , we describe the statistical properties of landauer transmission . in section [ eigen ] , we discuss the statistical properties of eigenstates , as measured by the entropy and inverse participation ratios ( i.p.r . ) .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "a , we translate the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the distribution of the self - energy in the localized phase into a traveling - wave tail analysis for the landauer transmission discussed in section [ trans ] . in appendix b",
    ", we explain how such a similar tail analysis can be performed in the delocalized phase for auxiliary variables that are closely related to inverse participation ratios .",
    "finally , in appendix c , we recall the results of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the traveling / non - traveling phase transition for a branching random walk in the presence of a moving absorbing wall , since these results are used as a comparison in the text to understand the finite - size scaling properties in the critical region .",
    "in quantum coherent problems , the most appropriate characterisation of transport properties consists in defining a scattering problem where the disordered sample is linked to incoming wires and outgoing wires and in studying the reflexion and transmission coefficients .",
    "this scattering theory definition of transport , first introduced by landauer @xcite , has been much used for one - dimensional systems @xcite and has been generalized to higher dimensionalities and multi - probes measurements ( see the review @xcite ) . in dimension @xmath24 , the transfer matrix formulation of the schrdinger equation yields that the probability distribution of the landauer transmission becomes asymptotically log - normal @xcite , i.e. one has @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the localization length and where @xmath27 is a sample - dependent random variable of order @xmath28 distributed with a gaussian law .",
    "although it is often assumed that this log - normal distribution persists in the localized phase in dimension @xmath29 , recent numerical studies @xcite are in favor of the following scaling form for the logarithm of the conductance @xmath30 with exponents of order @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite , whereas @xmath33 from eq .",

    "we will instead study the statistical properties of the transmission @xmath70 at zero energy @xmath55 as a function of the disorder strength @xmath0 ( eq [ flat ] ) and of the number @xmath1 of generations .",
    "but before discussing the disordered case , let us first describe the finite - size properties of the pure case .      in the pure case where all on - site energies vanish @xmath78 , all branches are equivalent and there is no dependence on @xmath79 . the recursions for riccati variables of eqs [ riccatioutgoing ] , [ riccatifirst ] and [ riccatiinside ] give @xmath80 i.e. one obtains the simple alternation between odd and even generations @xmath81 the reflexion coefficient @xmath45 thus vanishes exactly for any even size @xmath82 @xmath83 and the transmission coefficient in each branch @xmath84 reads @xmath85 ( note that for pure trees of uneven size , the reflexion would not vanish .",
    "this is why in the disordered case , we will only consider trees of even sizes @xmath41 where in the corresponding pure case , the reflexion vanish exactly for any finite tree ) .",
    "it is instructive to write now the corresponding wave function as a function of the generation n , @xmath86 this exponential decay of the wavefunction in this delocalized case is very peculiar to the tree geometry : it is imposed by the energy conservation and by the exponential growth of the number of sites with the generation @xmath87 .",
    "if one wishes to study numerically real trees , one is limited to rather small number of generations of order @xmath88 ( see for instance the study @xcite based on exact diagonalization ) because the number of sites and thus of random energies grows exponentially in @xmath1 . from the point of view of convergence towards stable probability distributions via recursion relations , it is thus better to use the so - called pool method that will allow us to study much larger number of generations ( see below eq . [ pool5 ] ) .",
    "the idea of the pool method is the following : at each generation , one keeps the same number @xmath89 of random variables to represent probability distributions . within our present framework , the probability distribution @xmath90 of the riccati variables @xmath91 at generation @xmath87",
    "will be represented by a pool of @xmath89 complex values @xmath92 .",

    "the pool method is also very much used for disordered systems on hierarchical lattices ( see for instance@xcite ) ,    in the remaining of this section , we present the numerical results obtained with a pool of size @xmath111 we have also results for a pool of size @xmath112 with a number of generations @xmath113 to see how the results change with the pool size .",
    "however , the number of generations @xmath114 for this bigger pool @xmath115 has turned out to be less precise in the critical region .",
    "all figures shown below thus corresponds to data obtained with the pool of size @xmath116 .    as is usual with the pool method @xcite , the location of the critical point depends on the pool , i.e. on the discrete sampling with @xmath89 values of probability distributions .",
    "it is expected to converge towards the thermodynamic critical point only in the limit @xmath117 ( see the discussion of section [ fspool ] in appendix b ) .",
    "nevertheless , for each given pool , the critical behaviors with respect to this pool - dependent critical point usually allows a good measure of critical exponents @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the pool of size @xmath116 , the critical value @xmath118 of the disorder strength where the localization - delocalization occurs for the landauer transmission is of order @xmath119 for the pool of size @xmath115 , we find that it is higher and of order @xmath120 .",
    "this rather important shift of the pseudo - critical point with the pool size which has already been seen in @xcite , seems to be due to the very slow logarithmic convergence of traveling wave velocity in the presence of cut - off ( see the discussion of section [ fspool ] in appendix b ) .",
    "so we stress that here , in contrast to @xcite , our goal is not to determine the true thermodynamic mobility edge @xmath121 , but instead to understand the critical behaviors of the finite - pool results with respect to the pool - dependent critical point of eq .",
