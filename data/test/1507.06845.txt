    "resonances are a phenomenon , which occurs often in physics and can be easily understood heuristically . nevertheless , studying it mathematically rigorously",
    "is more difficult .",
    "there are two main definitions of resonances   _ resolvent resonances _ ( poles of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent into the non - physical sheet ) and _ scattering resonances _ ( poles of the meromorphic continuation of the scattering matrix ) .",
    "non - compact quantum graph , where halflines are attached to a compact part of the graph ( see figure  [ fig0 ] ) , provides a good background for studying resonances .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that on quantum graph the above two definitions are almost equivalent ; to be precise , the set of resolvent resonances is equal to the union of the set of scattering resonances and the set of the eigenvalues supported only on the internal part of the graph .",
    "there is a large bibliography on resonances in quantum graphs ; for the quantum chaos community e.g. the papers @xcite might be interesting .",
    "the pseudo orbit expansion is a powerful tool for the trace formula expansion and the secular equation on compact quantum graphs .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the method has been recently adjusted to finding the resonance condition for non - compact quantum graphs @xcite .",
    "the resonance asymptotics on non - compact quantum graphs was first studied in @xcite , where it was observed that some graphs do not obey expected weyl behaviour and a criterion for distinguishing non - weyl graphs with standard coupling has been obtained .",
    "this criterion was later generalized in @xcite to all possible couplings .",
    "asymptotics for magnetic graphs was studied in @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite shows how to find the constant by the leading term of the asymptotics for non - weyl graphs and gives bounds on this constant .",
    "in the current note we continue in investigating this problem and illustrate the main results of @xcite on several simple examples with standard coupling .",
    "in particular , we focus on the pseudo orbit expansion and explain to the reader in detail how to construct the resonance condition by this method . the paper is structured as follows . in the second section",
    "we introduce the model and the resonance asymptotics .",
    "the third section deals with the pseudo orbit expansion . in the section",
    "4 we give two theorems on the effective size of an equilateral graph . in all these three section",
    "we give theorems without proofs , which can be found in the referred papers .",
    "the only exception is the theorem  [ thm - vertexscat ] , where a simpler proof than the general one from @xcite is given .",
    "the last three section are devoted the the examples of non - weyl graphs . in all of them",
    "the resonance condition is obtained from a regular directed graph and then from a simplified graph after deleting some of its edges .",
    "we assume a quantum graph with attached halflines . we consider a metric graph  @xmath0 , which consists of the set of vertices  @xmath1 and the set of edges  @xmath2 .",
    "there are @xmath3 finite edges , parametrized by the segments @xmath4 , and @xmath5 infinite edges , parametrized by @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 , then we call the graph non - compact and by its compact part we denote the union of finite internal edges",
    ". example of this non - compact graph is shown in figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "the graph is equipped with the quantum hamiltonian @xmath8 acting as negative second derivative with the domain consisting of functions in the sobolev space @xmath9 ( this space consists of sobolev spaces on the edges ) which fulfill the coupling conditions at the vertices @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a @xmath12 unitary matrix ( @xmath13 is the degree of the given vertex ) , @xmath14 is @xmath12 unit matrix , @xmath15 is the vector of limits of functional values at the given vertex and @xmath16 is the vector of limits of outgoing derivatives .    in this paper , we will mostly consider standard coupling ( sometimes also known as kirchhoff , free or neumann )   in this case the functional values are continuous in the vertex and the sum of outgoing derivatives is equal to zero .",
    "the corresponding coupling matrix is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a @xmath12 matrix with all entries equal to one .",
    "we will study _ resolvent resonances_. the resolvent resonance is often defined as pole of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent @xmath19 .",
    "we will use a simpler definition , proof that both definitions are equivalent can be done by the method of complex scaling @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath20 is a resolvent resonance of @xmath8 if there is a generalized eigenfunction @xmath21 , which satisfies @xmath22 on all edges of the graph , satisfies the coupling conditions ( [ eq - coupl ] ) at the vertices and its restriction to each halfline is @xmath23 .",
    "the counting function @xmath24 gives the number of all resolvent resonances ( including multiplicities ) in the circle of radius  @xmath25 centered at the origin in the @xmath26-plane .",
    "now we state the surprising result of davies and pushnitski @xcite on the existence of graphs with non - weyl asymptotics .    for graphs with standard coupling",
    "the following bound on the counting function holds @xmath27 with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the sum of the lengths of the internal edges of the graph .",
    "@xmath30 is strictly smaller than @xmath29 iff there exists a balanced vertex , the vertex for which there is the same number of internal and external edges .",
    "in this section , we lay theoretical grounds for the method of pseudo orbit expansion .",
    "the method of pseudo orbit expansion was used to finding the spectrum and trace formula for compact quantum graphs ( we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "the method was recently adjusted by the author to obtain the resonance condition for graphs with attached halflines @xcite .",
    "we explain here the method , in most cases omitting the proofs , which can be found in the above references .",
    "we define an effective vertex - scattering matrix , which gives effective scattering from the internal edges to other internal edges emanating from a vertex with radiating condition on the halflines .",
    "let us assume a vertex @xmath31 of the graph with @xmath32 internal edges , which emanate from this vertex , parametrized by @xmath4 with @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath34 halflines .",
    "let the solution of the schrdinger equation on these internal edges be @xmath35 and on the external edges @xmath36 .",
    "then the effective vertex - scattering matrix @xmath37 is given by the relation @xmath38 , where the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 have as entries the above coefficients of the outgoing and incoming waves , respectively .    [ thm - vertexscat ] the effective vertex - scattering matrix for the vertex @xmath31 with @xmath32 internal and @xmath34 external edges and the standard coupling is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is @xmath43 matrix with all entries equal to one and @xmath44 is @xmath43 unit matrix . in particular , for a balanced vertex @xmath45 .",
    "the theorem is proven as corollary 4.3 in @xcite , we will show here a direct proof . the coupling condition yield @xmath46 now we fix @xmath47 and substitute for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 from this equation we have @xmath51 from which the result follows .",
    "now we introduce the oriented graph @xmath52 , which is made from the compact part of the graph @xmath0 .",
    "each edge is replaced by two oriented edges @xmath53 , @xmath54 of the same length and opposite directions .",
    "for illustration see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we will define the following matrices .",
    "the @xmath55 matrix @xmath56 is a block - diagonalizable matrix written in the basis corresponding to @xmath57 which is block diagonal with blocks @xmath58 if transformed to the basis @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th edge ending at the vertex @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath55 matrix @xmath63 , the scattering matrix @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 may for general coupling be energy dependent .",
    "however , this is not the case for standard coupling , since the matrix @xmath68 is not energy dependent .",
    "the matrix @xmath64 is constructed in the following way .",
    "we denote its first @xmath3 rows by @xmath69 and the other @xmath3 rows by the edges in the opposite direction @xmath70 ; similarly we denote the columns .",
    "if @xmath53 ends in the vertex @xmath31 , then we write into the @xmath53-th column and all rows corresponding to oriented edges starting from @xmath31 the entries of the vertex - scattering matrix @xmath37 . to the @xmath54-th row",
    "we write the diagonal term of @xmath37 , to the other rows which correspond to the edges emanating from @xmath31 the nondiagonal terms ; in the rest of the rows in this column is zero .",
    "we continue with the theorem which is proven in @xcite , but the proof is with the exception of the effective vertex - scattering matrix the same as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the resonance condition is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a @xmath55 unit matrix .",
    "now we define periodic orbits , pseudo orbits and irreducible pseudo orbits .    a _ periodic orbit _ @xmath73 on the graph",
    "@xmath52 is a closed path on @xmath52 .",

    "we define @xmath83 .",
    "finally , by @xmath84 we denote the number of periodic orbits in the pseudo orbit @xmath74 .",

    "[ thm - rescon2 ] the resonance condition is given by the sum over irreducible pseudo orbits @xmath85    note that in general @xmath86 can be energy dependent , but this is not the case for standard coupling .",
    "now we focus on equilateral graphs   the graphs which have all the internal edges of the length @xmath87 .",
    "first , we give a theorem how to find the effective size of an equilateral graph .",
    "then we introduce a method how to reduce the number of oriented edges of the graph @xmath52 for an equilateral graph with standard coupling and balanced vertices .",
    "both theorems were proven in @xcite .",
    "[ thm - effsize ] let us assume an equilateral graph ( internal edges of lengths @xmath87 ) .",
    "then the effective size is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath90 .",
    "let us assume an equilateral graph @xmath0 for which no edge starts and ends in one vertex and no two vertices are connected by more than one edge .",
    "let us assume standard coupling and let there be a balanced vertex @xmath91 in which directed edges @xmath92 end .",
    "then the following construction does not change the resonance condition .",
    "we delete the directed edge @xmath78 of the graph @xmath52 , which starts in the vertex @xmath62 , and replace it by `` ghost edges '' @xmath93 , where the `` ghost edge '' @xmath94 starts in the vertex @xmath62 and continues to the directed edge @xmath95 .",
    "contribution of the irreducible pseudo orbit containing `` ghost edge '' @xmath96 to the resonance condition given by theorem  [ thm - rescon2 ] is the following .",

    "every `` ghost edge '' can be in the irreducible pseudo orbit used only once .",
    "similarly , one can delete more edges ; for each balanced vertex we delete an edge which ends in this vertex .",
    "for two abscissas and two halflines .",

    "there is dirichlet coupling ( @xmath98 ) at the spare ends ( vertices @xmath62 and @xmath99 ) of the abscissas and standard coupling in the central vertex ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the oriented graph @xmath52 is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "since the vertex @xmath91 is balanced , we have by theorem  [ thm - vertexscat ] @xmath100 .",

    "we obtain that the effective size of the graph is @xmath87 .",
    "now we find the resonance condition using pseudo orbits .",
    "the contribution of the pseudo orbits which do not include any bond is 1 . clearly , there are no irreducible pseudo orbits on one or three bonds .",
    "let us look at the contribution of the irreducible pseudo orbits on two edges , i.e. find the coefficient by @xmath104 .",
    "we have two irreducible pseudo orbits @xmath105 and @xmath106 . the scattering amplitude between @xmath107 and @xmath108",

    "the contribution of the irreducible pseudo orbit @xmath105 is @xmath111 , similarly for the pseudo orbit @xmath106 .",

    "the contribution of the irreducible pseudo orbit @xmath112 is @xmath114 , the contribution of the irreducible pseudo orbit @xmath113 is @xmath115 .",
    "hence the coefficient by @xmath116 is 0 , because contribution of the two irreducible pseudo orbits cancel .",
    "the resonance condition is @xmath117 .     after deleting the edge 1,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    since the vertex @xmath91 is balanced , we can also delete one bond which ends in this vertex , say bond 1 .",
    "we replace it by a `` ghost edge '' @xmath118 which starts at @xmath62 and continues to the only other edge which ends in @xmath91 , the bond @xmath119 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "now we can do pseudo orbit expansion again . the contribution of pseudo orbit which does not include any bond is 1 .",
    "we have two irreducible pseudo orbits on two `` non - ghost '' edges @xmath120 and @xmath106 .",
    "the former has contribution @xmath121 ( we have used the fact that the scattering amplitude between @xmath107 and @xmath119 is @xmath122 , because the scattering amplitude between @xmath107 and 1 was @xmath103 ) , the contribution of the latter is @xmath123 .",
    "again we obtain that the coefficient by @xmath104 is @xmath103 .",
    "there is no irreducible pseudo orbit , which would use all the three remaining `` non - ghost '' edges , even if it would use the `` ghost edge '' .",
    "clearly , there can not be also any pseudo orbit on four edges , because we have deleted one .",
    "again , we obtain the same resonance condition . in this case",
    "it was easier to find that the coefficient by @xmath116 is zero .",
    "we conclude that the resolvent resonances in this case are only eigenvalues @xmath124 with @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",

    "the matrix @xmath90 is @xmath129 its eigenvalues are 1 , @xmath109 with multiplicity 2 and 0 with multiplicity 3 .",

    "there is no irreducible pseudo orbit on 1 edge and on 5 edges .",
    "we have the following three irreducible pseudo orbits on two edges : @xmath131 ; @xmath106 ; @xmath132 .",

    "it is clear that there are no irreducible pseudo orbits on 4 , 5 or 6 edges and since no `` ghost edge '' continues to an edge ending in a vertex from which this `` ghost edge '' starts , there are also no pseudo orbits on one edge .",
    "there are three irreducible pseudo orbits on two `` non - ghost edges '' @xmath153 ; @xmath154 ; @xmath155 and there are two irreducible pseudo orbits on three edges @xmath133 and @xmath156 .",
