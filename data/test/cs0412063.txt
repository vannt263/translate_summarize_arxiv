    "labelled transition systems are a fundamental modelling formalism in many areas of computer science and one often needs to compare two or more such systems in applications . for example , in doing state compression prior to model checking one wants to ensure that the compressed system yields the same model checks as the uncompressed one .",
    "similarly , if one system is a specification and another one its implementation , then program correctness can be established by proving these systems to be equivalent . by the same token , if two systems are not equivalent , one may want to know to what degree this is so , e.g.  in a risk analysis of a safety - critical system .",
    "this paper chooses bisimulation as the notion of equivalence of labelled transition systems .",
    "bisimulation is an established , sufficiently fine - grained notion of equivalence between labelled transition systems @xcite so any approximative notions , e.g.  testing @xcite , have bisimulation as a well accepted point of reference .",
    "since quantitative aspects ought to be invariant under bisimulation , we stipulate that the quotient of all labelled transition systems with respect to bisimulation is the right conceptual space for reasoning about and comparing quantitative aspects of labelled transition systems .    if two labelled transition systems are not bisimilar , one may require a quantitative measure of such differences and such a measure has many applications .",
    "we mention security protocols @xcite , where one system is the specification and the other is an implementation and where we may wish to quantify illicit information flow @xcite or the effort needed to expose implementation flaws ; modal specifications @xcite , where a specification captures a possibly infinite set of mutually non - bisimilar labelled transition systems ; and requirements engineering @xcite , where each system may be the modal specification of a particular viewpoint and _ consistency measures on modal specifications _ are sought .",
    "one principal aim of this paper is to unify several strands of established work in one integrated framework : metric semantics of processes  la bakker & zucker @xcite ; use of hennessy - milner logic , domain theory and transition systems  la abramsky @xcite ; means of under - specifying and refining processes  la larsen & thomsen @xcite ; and representations of classical topological spaces as maximal - point spaces of domains  la lawson @xcite . to that end",
    ", we use a domain @xmath0 , defined in @xcite and shown to be a universal model for finitely - branching modal transition systems and fully abstract for their refinement in loc .",
    "specifically , we discover that the metric induced by the lawson topology on @xmath0 is a generalization of the one in @xcite to modal transition systems ; that the subspace of maximal elements of @xmath0 is a stone space with respect to the lawson ( or scott ) topology ; and that this stone space is an isomorphic representation of the quotient of all labelled transition systems modulo bisimulation , so the topology and metric carry over to that quotient .",
    "since a stone space has a _ complete _ ultra - metric , our model has labelled transition systems that are not image - finite , allowing the modelling of continuous state spaces , but all labelled transition systems can be approximated by image - finite ones to any degree of precision .",
    "the compactness of this quotient space then makes it possible to study the topological structure of sets of implementations for modal transition systems , the second principal aim of this paper .",
    "in particular , our topological analysis shows that 3-valued model checking @xcite reasons about compact sets of labelled transition systems , namely the set of all 2-valued refinements of a given 3-valued system .",
    "we propose two measures , a pessimistic and an optimistic one , for how close any refining labelled transition systems of two such 3-valued systems can be .",
    "using compactness , we prove that the optimistic measure is zero iff the two 3-valued systems in question have a common refinement .",
    "our concepts and results are also _ robust under a change of representation _ , e.g.  in moving from event - based to state - based systems or those that combine state and event information .",
    "it would be of interest to see whether results similar to the ones of this paper are obtainable for systems that explicitly represent time , probability ( e.g.  as done in @xcite ) or other quantitative information .    in section  [ section : domain ] we review modal transition systems , their refinement , and a fully abstract domain model for these notions .",
    "section  [ section : stone ] establishes the central result of this paper , showing that the maximal - points space of the fully abstract domain of section  [ section : domain ] is a stone space and the quotient of all labelled transition systems with respect to bisimulation . in section",
    "[ section : applications ] we give three applications of the compactness of this maximal - points space : a compactness theorem for hennessy - milner logic on compact sets of implementations , an abstract interpretation of compact sets of implementations as scott - closed sets of modal transition systems , and a robust consistency measure for modal transition systems .",
    "section  [ section : related ] states related work , and section  [ section : conclude ] concludes .",
    "modal transition systems @xcite are defined like labelled transition systems , except that transitions come in two modes that specify whether such transitions must or may be implemented . a refinement relation between modal transition systems",
    "therefore associates to a modal transition system those refining labelled transition systems in which all implementation choices have been resolved . in this section",
    "we formalize these notions and present the domain of @xcite as a faithful mathematical model of the model - checking framework of modal transition systems .",
    "we define larsen & thomsen s modal transition systems @xcite , their refinement and other key concepts formally and present the domain @xmath0 which is a fully abstract model of such systems and their refinement @xcite .",
    "our results are shown within that domain . in this paper , let @xmath1 be a fixed finite set of events and @xmath2 the set of finite words over @xmath3 with @xmath4 denoting the word of length zero .",
    "the labelled transition systems considered here have events from @xmath3 only .",
    "the structural properties of our domain model require that we also define dams more general notion of mixed transition systems @xcite .    a modal transition system @xmath5 has two transition relations @xmath6 on a set of states @xmath7 . the sets @xmath8 and @xmath9 specify _ contractual promises or expectations _ about the reactive capacity and incapacity of implementations , respectively .",
    "these guarantees are to be understood with respect to the refinement of states .",
    "we write `` _ a _ '' in @xmath10 to denote * a*sserted behavior and `` _ c _ '' in @xmath11 to denote * c*onsistent behavior and use these annotations in judgments @xmath12 and @xmath13 below with the same meaning .    in figure",
