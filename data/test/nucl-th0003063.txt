    "the presence of attractive interactions in a degenerate fermionic system destabilizes the fermi surface and leads to the formation of cooper pairs  the system becomes a superconductor @xcite .",
    "when increasing the quark density in cold quark matter , asymptotic freedom implies that single - gluon exchange becomes the dominant interaction between quarks .",
    "single - gluon exchange is attractive in the color - antitriplet channel , and therefore leads to color superconductivity in cold , dense quark matter @xcite .",
    "considerable activity has been recently generated @xcite by the observation that the zero - temperature color - superconducting gap @xmath2 can be as large as 100 mev @xcite .",
    "gaps of this magnitude may have important consequences for the physics of nuclear collisions .",
    "the critical temperature for the onset of color superconductivity , @xmath3 , is ( to leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath4 ) related to @xmath2 in the same way as in bcs theory , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath6 mev , it can not be excluded that color - superconducting quark matter could be created in nuclear collisions in the gsi  sis or bnl  ags energy range .    in order to compute the color - superconducting gap ,",
    "one commonly solves a gap equation @xcite . for theories with point - like four - fermion interactions , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the quark chemical potential",
    ", @xmath9 is a constant , and @xmath10 is the four - fermion coupling strength @xcite . on the other hand , in qcd , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is another constant @xcite . in weak coupling , there are then three different energy scales , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gluon mass . at @xmath15 and for @xmath16 flavors of massless",
    "quarks @xcite , @xmath17    the value of @xmath12 depends on the form of the gluon propagator in the cold , dense quark medium .",
    "if one takes the gluon propagator in the standard  hard dense loop  ( hdl ) approximation @xcite , one obtains @xmath18 @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the quarks inside the hdl s are assumed to be in the normal , and not the color - superconducting phase .",
    "consequently , an important question that has to be addressed is how color superconductivity influences the propagation of gluons and whether this could change @xmath12 . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "i have derived a general expression for the gluon self - energy in a two - flavor color superconductor , and explicitly computed the self - energy in the static limit , @xmath19 , for gluon momenta @xmath20 , and for @xmath21 .    in a two - flavor color superconductor ,",
    "condensation of cooper pairs in a channel of total spin @xmath22 breaks @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "then , the three gluons corresponding to the generators of the unbroken @xmath24 subgroup are expected to remain massless , while the other five should attain a mass through the anderson ",
    "higgs mechanism .",
    "an explicit computation of the gluon self - energy to one - loop order in perturbation theory confirms this qualitative expectation , but quantitatively reveals some surprising details @xcite . at @xmath15",
    ", the three gluons of the unbroken @xmath24 attain no meissner mass , but also no debye mass .",
    "this means that static , homogeneous color - electric fields of the unbroken @xmath24 subgroup are not screened .",
    "furthermore , the debye and meissner masses of the remaining five gluons are not identical : four gluons have a debye mass @xmath25 and a meissner mass @xmath26 , while the last one has a debye mass @xmath27 , like in the non - superconducting phase , but a meissner mass @xmath28 .    on the other hand , in a three - flavor color superconductor the color and flavor @xmath0 symmetry is broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath1 .",
    "this locks color and flavor rotations @xcite . from the 18 goldstone bosons resulting from symmetry breaking ,",
    "eight get `` eaten '' by the gluons , which consequently become massive .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to complement the results of @xcite for the two - flavor case with the computation of the debye and meissner masses of these gluons in the three - flavor case .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that here , as well as in @xcite , the terms `` debye mass '' and `` meissner mass '' refer exclusively to the screening of _ color_-electric and _ color_-magnetic fields .",
    "the `` ordinary '' ( electro-)magnetic meissner effect was studied in @xcite . similar to the mixing of weak and electromagnetic gauge bosons in the standard model , the electromagnetic field mixes with the eighth gluon to form a modified photon , under which the color - superconducting condensate is electrically neutral .",
    "the mass of the modified eighth gluon becomes slightly larger than that of the other seven .",
    "however , the mixing angle as well as this increase in mass is determined by the ratio of electromagnetic and strong coupling constants and consequently quite small .",
    "therefore , effects from electromagnetism will be neglected throughout the following .",
    "there is another reason why it is important to know the values for the debye and meissner mass .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom in the color - flavor locked phase at energy scales much smaller than the gap , @xmath2 , are the remaining 10 goldstone bosons resulting from the breaking of color and flavor symmetries .",
    "apart from an additional goldstone boson arising from breaking @xmath29 , these bosons are analogous to the pseudoscalar mesons which result from chiral symmetry breaking in the qcd vacuum @xcite . consequently , the dynamics of these 10 goldstone bosons is described by an effective theory which resembles the lagrangian of the nonlinear sigma model , describing the dynamics of the chiral fields in the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "to lowest order , this lagrangian contains only kinetic terms , @xmath30 + 12\\ , f_{h}^2 \\ , \\left [ \\left ( \\partial_0 \\varphi \\right)^2 - v_{h}^2 \\left(\\bbox{\\nabla } \\varphi \\right)^2 \\right]\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are the fields corresponding to the meson octet in the qcd vacuum .",
    "these are the pions , the kaons , and the @xmath33 meson , which are the goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneous breaking of the @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "@xmath35 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "@xmath36 is the field corresponding to the meson singlet in the qcd vacuum , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath37 meson , which is the goldstone boson resulting from breaking @xmath38 spontaneously .",
    "( in the qcd vacuum , @xmath38 is also broken explicitly by instantons . at",
    "the quark densities relevant for the effective theory in the color - flavor locked phase , however , instantons play no longer any significant role @xcite . ) finally , @xmath39 is the goldstone mode resulting from breaking @xmath29 .",
    "this field has no analogon in the qcd vacuum .",
    "the coefficients of the kinetic terms are determined by the `` decay constants '' @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the presence of a medium breaks lorentz invariance , and the coefficients of the time - like and space - like terms may differ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the velocities @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are not necessarily equal to one .",
    "these velocities enter the dispersion relation of the goldstone bosons as @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the decay constants as well as the velocities can be computed by matching the effective theory to the underlying microscopic theory . a convenient way to do this",
    "was proposed by son and stephanov @xcite .",
    "first , they observed that , by minimally gauging the model ( [ efftheory ] ) , for instance the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath40 is related to the debye mass of the gluons , @xmath48 , via @xmath49 and the velocity of the pseudoscalar mesons is determined from the ratio of debye and meissner masses , @xmath50 the problem is thus reduced to computing these masses in the underlying theory . in this case , one has two choices .",
    "first , one may use qcd in the color - superconducting ground state .",
    "this theory has quasiparticle as well as quasi - antiparticle excitations , and is valid at all energy scales .",
    "second , one may start from the effective theory proposed by hong @xcite .",
    "this theory contains only quasiparticle excitations around the fermi surface , quasi - antiparticle excitations have already been integrated out .",
    "it is valid at energy scales which are much smaller than the chemical potential , @xmath8 , but which can be larger than the gap , @xmath2 .",
    "son and stephanov @xcite used the latter theory to compute the debye and meissner masses .",
    "their results are @xmath51 consequently , the velocity of the pseudoscalar mesons is @xmath52 .",
    "note that the ( square of the ) debye mass in the three - flavor superconductor , @xmath53 , is reduced by a factor 3.5 as compared to its value in a normal , cold medium , @xmath54 .",
    "the result ( [ ss ] ) is not undisputed throughout the literature .",
    "for instance , rho , shuryak , wirzba , and zahed @xcite computed the debye and meissner masses from the gluon self - energy in the full theory , including quasi - antiparticle excitations .",
    "they obtained [ see eqs .",
    "( a.72 ) and ( a.75 ) of @xcite ] , @xmath55 this is quite surprising , as it implies that the velocity of the pseudoscalar mesons is superluminous , @xmath56 .",
    "other results that can be found in the literature are those of zarembo @xcite , which agree with son and stephanov s calculation .",
    "beane , bedaque , and savage @xcite agree with son and stephanov on the debye and meissner masses up to a factor of 2 .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to resolve this ambiguity in the literature .",
    "the debye and meissner masses will be computed in the full theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , qcd in the color - superconducting ground state .",
    "the framework for such a computation was already established in @xcite . as shown in the following section ,",
    "the results are found to agree with those of son and stephanov , eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) .",
    "the debye and meissner masses are not only important for the nonlinear version ( [ efftheory ] ) of the effective low - energy theory in a three - flavor color superconductor .",
    "as outlined in @xcite they also determine the coefficients of the kinetic terms in the _ linear _ version of the effective theory , @xmath57   + \\alpha_{\\rm m } \\sum_{h = r,\\ell }   { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\left ( d_i \\phi_h \\right)^\\dagger \\ ,   d^i \\phi_h \\right ]   \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] since there is no reason why right- and left - handed terms should differ in normalization , i assumed @xmath58 , and similarly for the coefficient of the space - like terms , @xmath59 . for color - flavor locking , the order parameter is a @xmath60 matrix with expectation value @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath62 , @xmath63 . due to explicit symmetry breaking by nonzero quark masses ( and , at less than asymptotically high densities , instantons ) ,",
    "the true ground state of the color - flavor locked phase corresponds to the @xmath64 channel where @xmath65 .",
    "then , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "i use natural units , @xmath68 , and work in euclidean space - time @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the volume and @xmath71 the temperature of the system .",
