    "m. kac s classical paper  can one hear the shape of a drum \" @xcite , triggered intensive research in two complementary aspects of this problem . on the one hand ,",
    "a search for systems for which kac s question is answered in the affirmative was conducted , and , on the other hand , various examples of pairs of systems which are isospectral but not isometric were identified . in the present paper",
    "we shall focus our attention to quantum graphs and in the following lines will review the subject of isospectrality in this limited context .",
    "the interested reader is referred to [ 1 - 11 ] for a broader view of the field where spectral inversion and its uniqueness are discussed .",
    "spectral problems related to graphs emerge in two distinct ways . in the first , the spectrum of the connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix is considered .",
    "it represents a discrete version of the laplacian , and for finite graphs , the spectrum is finite .",
    "this set of problems is often referred to as combinatorial graphs .",
    "quantum ( metric ) graphs are obtained by associating the standard metric to the bonds which connect the vertices .",
    "the schrdinger operator consists of the one - dimensional laplacians on the bonds complemented by appropriate boundary conditions at the vertices ( see next section ) .",
    "the spectrum of quantum graphs is unbounded , and it displays many interesting features which made it a convenient paradigm in the study of quantum chaos @xcite .    shortly after the appearance of kac s paper , m. e. fisher published his work  on hearing the shape of a drum \" @xcite , where he addresses isospectrality for the discrete version of the laplacian .",
    "since then , the study of isospectral combinatorial graphs made very impressive progress .",
    "in particular , several methods to construct isospectral yet different graphs were proposed .",
    "a review of this problem can be found in @xcite . in particular , a method which was originally put forward by sunada @xcite to construct isospectral laplace - beltrami operators on riemann manifolds , was adapted for the corresponding problem in the context of combinatorial graphs . here",
    "we shall go one step further , and show that it can be also adapted for quantum graphs .",
    "the conditions under which the spectral inversion of quantum graphs is unique were studied previously . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in general , the spectrum does not determine uniquely the length of the bonds and their connectivity .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that quantum graphs whose bond lengths are _ rationally independent _  can be heard \" - that is - their spectra determine uniquely their connectivity matrices and their bond lengths .",
    "this fact follows from the existence of an exact trace formula for quantum graphs @xcite .",
    "thus , isospectral pairs of non congruent graphs , must have rationally dependent bond lengths .",
    "the sunada method , which is based on constructing the isospectral domains by concatenating several copies of a given building block , automatically provides us with graphs with rationally dependent lengths .",
    "an example of a pair of metrically distinct graphs which share the same spectrum was already discussed in @xcite . in a previous report",
    "we have shown that all the known isospectral domains in @xmath0 @xcite have corresponding isospectral pairs of quantum graphs @xcite . here , we shall take the subject one step further , and propose that isospectral graphs can be resolved by counting their nodal domains .",
    "that is , the nodal counts of eigenfunctions belonging to the same spectral value are not the same .",
    "the idea that nodal counts resolve isospectrality was suggested in @xcite for a family of isospectral flat tori in 4-d , and was tested numerically . the present work offers both rigorous and numerical evidence to substantiate the validity of this conjecture in a few examples of isospectral graphs . for these examples",
    "the nodal counts differences ocur on a substantial fraction of the spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "for the sake of completeness we shall give a short review of some elementary definitions and facts on quantum graphs .",
    "we shall then show how pairs of isospectral domains in @xmath0 can be reduced to isospectral pairs of quantum graphs , and discuss their spectra and eigenfunctions .",
    "finally , we shall study the nodal domains of these eigenfunctions and show that by counting nodal domains one can resolve the isospectral ambiguity of the graphs presented .",
    "we consider finite graphs consisting of @xmath1 _ vertices _ connected by @xmath2 _",
    "bonds_. the @xmath3 _ connectivity matrix _ will be denoted by @xmath4 : @xmath5 when the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected by @xmath8 bonds , and it vanishes otherwise .",
    "the group of bonds which emerge from the vertex @xmath6 form a  star \" which will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 of a vertex is defined as the cardinality of the star @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "vertices with @xmath12 belong to the graph _",
    "boundary_. the vertices with @xmath13 belong to the graph _ interior_. the bonds are endowed with the standard metric , and the coordinates along the bonds @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 . the length of the bonds will be denoted by @xmath16 , and the total length of the graph is @xmath17 .",
    "the domain of the schrdinger operator on the graph is the space of functions which belong to sobolev space @xmath18 on each bond b and at the vertices they are continuous and obey boundary conditions as is mentioned in ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "the operator is constructed in the following way .",
    "on the bonds , it is identified as the laplacian in 1-d @xmath19 .",
    "it is supplemented by boundary conditions on the vertices which ensure that the resulting operator is self adjoint .",
    "we shall consider in this paper the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions : @xmath20 the derivatives in ( [ eq : bc ] ) are directed out of the vertex @xmath6 .",
    "_ comment _ : the neumann boundary conditions will be assumed throughout , unless otherwise stated .",
    "a wave function with a wave number @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath14 connects the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the wave function @xmath23 takes the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the form ( [ eq : wavefun ] ) ensures continuity .",
    "the spectrum @xmath26 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are determined by substituting ( [ eq : wavefun ] ) in ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "the resulting homogeneous linear equations for the @xmath24 are written as @xmath27 and a non trivial solution exists when @xmath28 the spectrum @xmath29 , which is a discrete , positive and unbounded sequence is the zero set of the _ secular function _ @xmath30 .",
    "the secular functions of the type ( [ eq : secular ] ) have poles on the real @xmath21 axis , which renders them rather inconvenient for numerical studies .",
    "the secular function can be easily regularized in various ways , ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the complete wave function can be written down in terms of the vertex wave functions at the interior vertices with @xmath31 only . in the sequel",
    "we shall denote their number by @xmath32 .",
    "this reduces the dimension of the matrix @xmath33 above from @xmath1 to @xmath32 .",
    "the nodal domains of the eigenfunctions ( the connected domains where the wave function is of constant sign ) , are of two types .",
    "the ones that are confined to a single bond are rather trivial .",
    "their length is exactly half a wavelength and their number is on average @xmath34 .",
    "the nodal domains which extend over several bonds emanating from a single vertex vary in length and their existence is the reason why counting nodal domains on graphs is not a trivial task .",

    "( [ eq : nnb2 ] ) holds for the case of an eigenfunction which does not vanish on any vertex : @xmath39 .",
    "recently schapotschnikow @xcite proved that sturm s oscillation theorem extends to finite tree ( loop - less ) graphs :",
    "the number of nodal domains of the @xmath40th eigenfunction ( ordered by increasing eigenvalues ) is @xmath40 .",
    "berkolaiko @xcite have shown that the number of nodal domains is bounded to the interval @xmath41 $ ] where @xmath42 is the minimal number of bonds which should be cut so that the resulting graph is a tree .",
    "nodal domains can be also defined and counted in an alternative way which makes use of the vertex wave functions @xmath43 ( see ( [ eq : wavefun ] ) ) exclusively :    _ a nodal domain consists of a maximal set of connected interior vertices ( @xmath31 ) _     _ where the vertex wave functions have the same sign .",
    "_    this definition has to be modified if any of the @xmath24 vanishes .",
    "then , the sign attributed to it is chosen to maximize the number of nodal domains @xcite .",
    "we thus have two independent ways to define and count nodal domains . to distinguish between them",
    "we shall refer to the first as _ metric _ nodal domains , and the number of metric domains in the @xmath40th eigenfunction will be denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "berkolaiko s theorem states that @xmath45 .",
    "the domains defined in terms of the vertex wave functions will be referred to as the _ discrete _ nodal domains .",
    "the number of discrete nodal domains of the @xmath40th vertex wave function will be denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "the sequences of metric and discrete nodal domains counts @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the main objects of study of the present paper .",
    "the first pair of isospectral planar domains which was introduced by gordon , web and wolpert @xcite is a member of a much larger set which was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this was extended in @xcite to include domains which differ in the distribution of boundary conditions ( dirichlet or neumann ) along their boundaries .",
    "the common feature of these sets of pairs of isospectral domains is that they are constructed using the sunada method @xcite , and they share a few important and distinctive attributes :    * the domains are constructed by concatenating an elementary  building block \" in two different prescribed ways to form the two domains .",
    "a building block is joined to another by reflecting along the common boundary .",
    "the shape of the building block is constrained only by symmetry requirements , but otherwise it is quite general . *",
    "the eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue are related to each other by a _",
    "transplantation_. that is , the eigenfunction in a building block of one domain can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenfunction in several building blocks in the other domain .",
    "the transplantation matrix is independent of the considered eigenvalue . * the construction of these pairs reflects an abstract algebraic structure which was identified by sunada @xcite .",
    "an example of an isospectral pair of domains in @xmath49 and its building block is given in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](a ) ) .",
    "this is a pair whose construction is described in @xcite .",
    "it is denoted there by @xmath50 .",
    "other examples are displayed in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we can construct _ metric _ graphs which are analogous to these domains , by replacing the building blocks by appropriate graphs which preserve the requires symmetry .",
    "as an example , the triangular building block in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](a ) ) can be replaced by a 3 - star with bonds of lengths @xmath51 , @xmath14 and @xmath52 as shown in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](b ) ) .",
    "this yields the pair of isospectral but non isometric graphs shown in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](c ) ) .",
    "( in drawing figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](c ) ) we took advantage of the fact that the  angles \" between the bonds are insignificant ) .",
    "note that the two graphs share the same connectivity matrix ( they are topologically congruent ) however they are not isometric . as a matter of fact the right and the left graphs are interchanged when the bonds  @xmath14 \" with ",
    "@xmath52 \" are switched .",
    "thus , the lengths @xmath14 and @xmath52 must be different to ensure that the two graphs are not isometric .",
    "this is an example of an asymmetry requirement which the building block must satisfy .",
    "all other pairs of isospectral domains proposed in @xcite can be converted to their analogous quantum graphs ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "two examples are shown in figure ( [ fig:13 - 3and13 - 8 ] ) .",
    "the most simple pair of isospectral domains can be built by applying the sunada method to the dihedral group @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting graphs are shown in figure ( [ fig : isospectral pair+notations ] ) , where the letters @xmath54 or @xmath55 specify the boundary conditions at the boundary vertices .",
    "( the boundary conditions at the interior vertices are always neumann ) .",
    "note that the two graphs are connected differently , in contrast with the previous example where the topology of the two graphs is the same . in [ appendix1 ] we give a brief description of the construction of this pair , as an example of the sunada method .    in a way of illustration",
    "we shall write explicitly the secular functions for the graphs shown above .",
    "starting with the @xmath50 pair , we have @xmath56 ( the interior vertices are marked by a black dot and are enumerated in figure 1(c ) ) . the secular function for the graph @xmath57",
    "is written in terms of the matrix @xmath58 here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 the corresponding vertex eigenfunction @xmath61 is the eigenvector of @xmath62 with a vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "the @xmath33 matrix for the graph @xmath63 is obtained from the matrix @xmath64 by interchanging @xmath52 and @xmath14 .",
    "explicit computation shows that @xmath65 .",
    "this proves the isospectrality of the two graphs .",
    "the sum of the elements of any of the columns of @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "hence the vector @xmath68 is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue @xmath67 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 for which @xmath69 are in the spectrum of both graphs .",
    "they correspond to eigenfunctions which are the same on each of the 3-stars - the building block of the complete graphs ( figure 1(b ) ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the condition @xmath69 is the secular equation for this 3-star with bond lengths @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this subset exhausts 1/7 of the spectrum of the graphs , and in this set the transplantation property is trivial .",
    "the transplantation property which is basic to the proof of isospectrality for the @xmath49 domains in @xcite can be explicitly formulated by the transplantation matrix     @xmath71 we observe that the inverse transplantation is also effected by @xmath72 : @xmath73 even though @xmath72 is not self inversive .",
    "the fact that @xmath72 induces the transplantation in the two directions , implies that the vertex wave functions @xmath74 must be eigenvectors of @xmath75 ( as long as the eigenvalue is not degenerate ) .",
    "the wave functions are defined up to normalization , and therefore the corresponding eigenvalues can be different than unity .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath75 consists of the eigenvalue @xmath76 and the six - fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the vertex wave functions are either proportional to @xmath78 , or belong to the 6 dimensional subspace of vectors orthogonal to @xmath78 .",
    "this observation will be used in the next section when the nodal structure of the eigenfunctions is to be discussed .",
    "other examples of pairs of isospectral graphs such as e.g. , the pair described in @xcite can be obtained from the isospectral graphs constructed above , by setting the length of the @xmath52 bond to zero .",
    "this was explicitly shown in @xcite .",
    "using similar special cases one can generate a rich variety of isospectral but not isometric quantum graphs .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized , that the skeleton of interior vertices form graphs which are identical to the topological , colored graphs which were introduced in @xcite to express the transplantation properties of the isospectral domains in @xmath49 .",
    "the quantum , metric graphs can be obtained simply by completing each topological vertex to a 3-vertex star graph with lengths @xmath70 .",
    "topological bonds are associated with lengths according to their colors , and bonds are added to the topological vertices with valency less than three , to complete them to 3- stars .",
    "this proves the statement made above that the computation carried out here can be repeated for any of the topological graphs shown in @xcite .",
    "the graphs corresponding to the isospectral domains @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown in figure [ fig:13 - 3and13 - 8 ] .",
    "+ i ii    the dihedral graphs are much simpler , with @xmath81 .",
    "their secular determinants can be shown to be identical functions of @xmath21 .",
    "this is an explicit demonstration that the graphs are indeed isospectral .",
    "the secular equation is obtained from @xmath82 as can be easily seen , @xmath83 has poles , and to get a regular secular function we have to multiply it by @xmath84 .",
    "it takes the form @xmath85    the transplantation matrix for this pair of graphs is derived in [ appendix1 ] .",
    "it reads @xmath86 the eigenvectors @xmath87 point at the directions @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "the transplantation ( [ eq : transdi ] ) implies that @xmath90 is obtained from @xmath91 by a rotation of @xmath92 counterclockwise .",
    "direct substitutions shows that @xmath93 where , @xmath94    the explicit form of the functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 will be used in the discussion of nodal counting in the next section .",
    "the real eigenfunctions of laplace - beltrami operators on two dimensional manifolds display usually an intricate sets of nodal domains - which are the connected domains where the sign of the eigenfunction is constant @xcite .",
    "sturm s oscillation theorem for systems in 1-d , and its extension by courant to any dimension , establish the connection between the number of nodal domains and the spectrum : the number of nodal domains @xmath44 of the @xmath40th eigenfunction is bounded by @xmath40 .",
    "( the eigenfunctions are arranged by increasing value of their eigenvalues ) .",
    "theorem for combinatorial graphs and for quantum graphs were proved in @xcite , respectively .    given a pair of isospectral domains .",
    "are the sequences of nodal counts @xmath97 identical ?",
    "in other words , can one use the information stored in the nodal sequences to resolve isospectrality ?",
    "this question was recently discussed in the context of isospectral flat tori in @xmath98 with @xmath99 @xcite , and numerical as well as analytical evidence was brought to substantiate the conjecture that the nodal sequences resolve isospectrality . in this section we shall provide rigorous as well as numerical evidence to show that the same is true for isospectral quantum graphs of the types discussed above .",
    "we shall start by discussing the _ discrete _ nodal sequences and then proceed to the _ metric _ nodal sequences .",
    "the _ discrete _ nodal domains were defined as the maximally connected sets of interior vertices with vertex wave functions of equal sign .",
    "their number is denoted by @xmath46 , and the nodal sequence is @xmath100 .",
    "we shall prove in the next subsection that for the dihedral graphs half of the entries in the sequences of discrete nodal counts are different .",
    "we are not able to provide a similar proof for the more complex graphs , but we shall bring numerical evidence which supports the conjecture that their sequences of discrete nodal counts are different",
    ".      the number of discrete nodal domains for this pair of dihedral graphs ( see figure [ fig : isospectral pair+notations ] ) can be either one or two , depending on whether the signs of the components of the ( two dimensional ) vertex eigenfunctions have the same sign or not .",
    "in other words ( see ( [ eq : tan ] ) ) , the number of nodal domains depend on the quadrant in the @xmath101 plane where the eigenvectors point : @xmath102 in the first and the third quadrants , and @xmath103 in the second and the fourth quadrants : @xmath104 the transplantation implies that the eigenvectors @xmath105 are obtained by rotating @xmath106 by @xmath92 counterclockwise",
    ". therefore , @xmath107 if the transplantation rotates the vectors across the quadrant borders . in other words , @xmath108 this observation is essential to our discussion since it expresses the problem of nodal counting in geometrical terms .",
    "it is convenient to construct finite subsequences @xmath109 and @xmath110 of discrete nodal count of graphs i and ii , restricted to the spectral points in the interval @xmath111 .",

    "however , numerical tests show that for an appreciable fraction of the wave functions , the nodal counts are distinct",
    ". we shall start the discussion by considering the case @xmath50 , for which we can turn the counting problem into a geometrical problem .",
    "the vertex wave functions which correspond to the same eigenvalues are related by transplantation : @xmath126 where @xmath74 stand now for the vertex wave function restricted to the 7 interior vertices in these graphs .",
    "we have already shown that eigenvectors @xmath127 are either proportional to @xmath128 ( the vector with constant entries)- in which case both have a single nodal domain , and @xmath129 , or the @xmath127 are orthogonal to @xmath128 .",

    "this result is certainly encouraging but not sufficient , and we are trying various options to substantiate it more rigourously .      the discussion of the metric nodal sequences is facilitated in the present examples of isospectral graphs since most of them are trees .",
    "then , by making use of schapotschnikow s theorem @xcite , the _ metric _ nodal counts @xmath141 .",

    "the dihedral group is generated by @xmath169 which obey @xmath170,@xmath171 .",
    "the 8 group elements of @xmath172 are @xmath173 .",
    "@xmath174 are reflections along the axis @xmath175 respectively ( figure [ fig : basic square ] ) .",
    "note that the multiplication should be read from right to left since the elements are transformations .",
    "this group has 5 irreducible representations ( irreps ) .",
    "four of them are one dimensional and one , which is of our interest , is two dimensional .",
    "the two dimensional representation is :        denote the second basis by @xmath181 .",
    "so that @xmath182 . notice that in the first form of the representation @xmath183 and @xmath184 are diagonal and in the second one @xmath185 and @xmath186 are diagonal .",
    "this will be exploited soon .",
    "the graph in figure [ fig : complete graph](a ) obeys the dihedral symmetry .",
    "examine the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger operator with neumann boundary conditions on all the vertices .",
    "the set of all the eigenfuncions of a certain eigenvalue @xmath187 form a finite dimensional vector space @xmath1 with some dimension @xmath188 .",
    "this vector space is invariant under the action of the dihedral group and therefore @xmath1 is the carrier space of some representation of @xmath172 .",
    "we are interested in the case that this representation is the two dimensional irrep of @xmath189 or that this representation is a reducible representation that contains the two dimensional irrep .",
    "consider the basis @xmath177 of this 2d irrep ( note that now @xmath190 have the meaning of wave functions on the graph in figure [ fig : complete graph ] ) . from the matrix which corresponds to @xmath183 in this basis ( see ( [ eq : repform1 ] ) ) we deduce that @xmath191 vanish on the axis x ( as an odd function with respect to that axis ) and as for @xmath192 , its derivative vanishes on the x axis ( since @xmath193 is an even function with respect to that axis and therefore its derivative is odd ) .",
    "using the notation from figure [ fig : complete graph](b ) , we have :       + similarly , examining the matrix of @xmath184 in this basis ( [ eq : repform1 ] ) yields @xmath195 + we can get similar observations by looking on the matrices of @xmath185 , @xmath186 , this time for the basis @xmath196 ( [ eq : repform2 ] ) .",
    "we get the following @xmath197 + now , a pair of isospectral graphs will be constructed out of the complete graph .",
    "each of the graphs in the pair will be a subgraph of the complete graph .",
    "graph i is the graph that consists of the vertices b , c , d , e , f and all the bonds which connect them .",
    "graph ii is the graph that consists of the vertices a , b , c , d and all the bonds which connect them ( figure [ fig : boundary conditions ] ) .",
    "we can define the subgraphs in another way which will become convenient later : using the axis @xmath198 as in figure [ fig : basic square ] we define two sets of coordinates @xmath199 and @xmath200 and use them to examine the complete graph .",
    "graph i is obtained when restricting ourselves to the region @xmath201 of the complete graph .",
    "graph ii is obtained when restricting to the region @xmath202 . for a certain eigenvalue @xmath187 of the complete graph",
    "whose representation contains the 2d irrep discussed before , we can define appropriate eigenfunctions on the two subgraphs by @xmath203 .",
    "the boundary conditions of @xmath204 are obtained from ( [ eq : bndcnds1.1]),([eq : bndcnds1.2]),([eq : bndcnds2.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bndcnds2.2 ] ) and are shown in figure [ fig : boundary conditions ] .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ thm3 ] : _ we will make use of the results above in order to construct a transplantation which proves the theorem .",

    "denote by @xmath209 the space of eigenfunctions which belong to the eigenvalue @xmath187 .",

    "it can be verified that @xmath191 , @xmath192 are valid eigenfunctions of the eigenvalue @xmath187 defined on the complete graph .",
    "if @xmath215 for some @xmath216 then we get that @xmath217 ( this can simply be concluded by considering the boundary conditions ) . therefore @xmath211 are independent eigenfunctions and form a basis @xmath218 for the appropriate eigenspace .",
    "this is exactly the basis @xmath219 of the first form of the 2d irrep of @xmath220 ( see [ eq : repform1 ] ) .",
    "( this can be verified for example by examining the representation of the generators @xmath221 of @xmath220 ) .",
    "now , we construct the basis @xmath222 by @xmath223 . and now define the function @xmath224 on graph ii by @xmath225 .",
    "we get that @xmath224 is an eigenfunction of graph ii which belongs to the eigenvalue @xmath187 and obeys the appropriate boundary conditions @xmath226 .    following this procedure",
    ", one can verify that @xmath72 is the transplantation matrix of the vertex wave functions .",
    "we can similarly describe the inverse transplantation .",
    "the inverse transplantation is linear and therefore if we have an independent set of eigenfunctions ( with the same eigenvalue ) they would remain independent after the transplantation . thus , the degeneracies of @xmath187 in @xmath227 and @xmath228 are equal .",
    "the existence of the inverse transplantation also proves that @xmath229 and the degeneracy is again the same .",
