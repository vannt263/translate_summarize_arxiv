    "error correcting codes are an important device for communicating information through noisy channels .",
    "we are living in what some social commentators have called the `` information age '' , with apparently ever increasing appetite for broadband internet , mobile phone data transmission , satellite television , computational power etc .",
    "hence , it is no surprise that such codes have are of significant practical use .",
    "a family of error - correcting codes based on an identification with the ever popular ising model from statistical mechanics were proposed by sourlas @xcite , and novel coding methods were examined @xcite . a further important advance , in terms of practical significance ,",
    "was the move to finite rate , finite length sourlas type codes @xcite - which used interactions between @xmath0 bits and @xmath1 interactions per bit .",
    "while these codes showed good theoretical performance , the number of successfully transmitted bits was significantly higher ( for certain channel noises ) when @xmath2 .",
    "however , in this case the basin of attraction ( boa ) for a local decoding algorithm is very small meaning that decoding is computationally extremely challenging for reasonable code lengths . a more directly useful version of the above theory involves cascading sourlas codes @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to use multiple values of @xmath0 in the interactions . for @xmath3 ( i.e. 2-body interactions )",
    "there is an energy landscape dominated by the state which overlaps the sent message .",
    "once an algorithm has found this state with good overlap , higher body interactions can be invoked which increase this overlap substantially provided that the state is within the boa of the high overlap state .",
    "belief propagation ( bp ) @xcite , which is closely related to the bethe approximation and the cavity ( replica ) method in finite connectivity disordered systems @xcite , has been the principle algorithm used for decoding the finite rate sourlas codes including the case of the cascade version .",
    "sometimes the quenched disorder in this problem , in the form of corrupted bits which cause frustration in the graph of bit interactions , brings about a certain disruption to the bp dynamics , which can lead to deterioration of error correction performance .",
    "recently , a finite temperature survey propagation algorithm ( sp ) @xcite was applied to a biased 3-body sourlas code @xcite .",
    "the latter found that this more advanced algorithm did lead to a shift in the critical channel noise for computationally feasible decoding when bp did not converge .",
    "they also noted that averaging the beliefs in time , or time averaged belief propagation ( tabp ) @xcite could improve decoding in such cases as well .",
    "however , the reason for this improvement has not been fully clarified yet .",
    "the objective of this article is to pinpoint the major contributing factors for such improvement in practical decoding . for this",
    ", we will investigate how the overlap between the original and estimated messages in the first state of the cascading codes , for which only @xmath4 interactions are considered , are influenced by the employed decoding algorithms when the almeida - thouless ( at ) stability is broken @xcite .",
    "for simplicity of numerical experiments , we will mainly focus on the zero temperature cases .",
    "although the model that we will deal with does not directly accord with those in the preceding work @xcite , the two systems have a common feature that the at stability is broken and , therefore , insights gained from our simpler system is probably useful for understanding what occurs in the biased 3-body interaction system at finite temperature . by applying sp to the first stage of a cascading sourlas code , we will find that we can increase the overlap with the original message below the at - transition , which in turn improves the chance of being within the boa for good decoding once we introduce higher body interactions .",
    "it has also recently been shown that the first step of replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) approach leads to higher values of the magnetisation for disordered ferromagnetically biased @xmath5 2-spin ising systems on finite connectivity random graphs @xcite .",
    "thus , we strongly speculate that the higher first stage overlap gained by introduction of the rsb ansatz in the cascading scheme is the main factor for the improvement of the error correcting performance .",
    "this speculation also suggests that algorithms based on increasing levels of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) would improve matters further , albeit at high computational cost .",
    "we make an initial investigation of this by a brief analysis of a 2rsb survey propagation ( 2sp : although this could rightly be called a survey of surveys propagation ) .",
    "we will also argue that tabp corresponds to survey propagation of a specific type for which the parisi parameter , which specifies the size of subgroups of replicas in the 1rsb ansatz , is set to zero and is never bettered by the simple bp algorithm , as is observed in cdma multiuser detection problems @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the model that we will study . in sections 3 and 4 , two decoding schemes based on bp and sp are presented in the case of vanishing temperature . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we will show numerically that the sp based algorithm with zero parisi parameter ( sp0 ) is , in practice , equivalent to tabp and provides a better performance than bp when the at stability is broken .",
    "this relationship of sp0 to other algorithms is provided analytically in the vanishing code rate limit in appendix a. the general proof of this relationship , unfortunately , not been managed yet .",
    "we also show numerically that 2sp can lead to an improvement of the decoding performance in the situation where the at stability broken .",
    "this implies that a further improvement can be expected by introducing a higher level rsb ansatz although the computational cost for decoding will be sacrificed .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary .",
    "we assume that we have some message source vector @xmath6 ( for simplicity of exposition we work within the ising formalism ) .",
    "we encode this source vector via a transformation to an @xmath7-bit vector @xmath8 where @xmath9 and where we have @xmath10 .",
    "the rate @xmath11 of such a code is given by @xmath12 .",
    "for each set @xmath13 , given its size , we populate it with indices at random from @xmath14 with each index appearing exactly once in any given set @xmath13 , and each index appearing @xmath15 times in each @xmath0 body interaction .",
    "we take the channel to be a binary symmetric channel so that when the encoded message vector @xmath8 is passed through the channel each bit is flipped independently with probability @xmath16 and we denote the received message by @xmath17 .",
    "the object of any decoding algorithm is to estimate @xmath18 with some @xmath19 using information from @xmath17 .",
    "a natural performance measure is the overlap between our estimate and the true message @xmath20 .",
    "one way to proceed with decoding is to look for the ground state of the following hamiltonian : @xmath21 since this hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation @xmath22 and @xmath23 we can gauge away the original message and are left with a multispin ferromagnetically biased @xmath5 spin glass model .    for the cascading approach",
    "we define a new auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "the initial step is to find minima of @xmath28 which is relatively easier than finding minima of @xmath29 .",
    "we then use this minima as an initial condition for local search algorithms looking for minima of the full hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "an approximate method of finding the groundstate is available via belief propagation , which is equivalent to the cavity method at the level of replica symmetry for locally tree like graphs , which the present code is in the long code length limit .",
    "the same results can be found in the ensemble of graphs in the thermodynamic ( long code length ) limit by use of the replica method , however , since we are interested in decoding particular examples the former method is preferable .",
    "the method has been discussed a great deal in recent literature @xcite so we will be relatively brief .",
    "we define cavity fields @xmath30 to be the field on site @xmath31 ( decoded estimator @xmath32 ) in the absence of link @xmath13 ( received bit @xmath33 ) and the message @xmath34 to be the message from received bit @xmath33 to decoded bit @xmath32 .",
    "we are working with a discrete energy model and a self - consistent solution to these equations is given by restricting the values of @xmath35 to integers .",
    "then , the belief propagation ( bp ) update equations describing these variables are : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the set @xmath38 and we take the convention @xmath39 .",
    "other than the trivial paramagnetic state ( @xmath40 ) , fixed points of the message passing equations ( [ eq : cavityupdates_rs ] ) correspond to local minima of the energy of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "however , it is certainly not guaranteed that the equations ( [ eq : cavityupdates_rs ] ) will converge at all .",
    "if the messages converge , or after some specified number of updates if they do not , the estimator for the original message bits is given by @xmath41 consider a specific example , that of a code with @xmath42 and @xmath43 so each original message bit @xmath44 is contained within three 2-body interactions and three 3-body interactions . due to the 3-body interactions we find that without using the cascading approach we never find the state with high overlap - even at zero channel noise - due to the higher body interactions , which is similar to the result found for purely ferromagnetic 3-body interactions in @xcite , where even for these purely ferromagnetic interactions the structure of the interactions led to glassiness .",
    "however , if we first allow the system to equilibrate using the energy landscape given by only the 2-body interactions ( so perform bp on the auxiliary hamiltonian ) we find that for a certain range of @xmath45 we obtain non - zero values of @xmath7 .",
    "since for purely 2-body interactions there is a reflection symmetry in the hamiltonian there is no bias at this stage between @xmath46 .",
    "however , when the 3-body interactions are added to the hamiltonian it is possible to infer which of these two states gives a better overlap overall , namely the state with lower energy .",
    "bp is then performed on the hamiltonian with the 3-body interactions added . in practice , we add the the 3-body interactions in three batches , at each batch we add one 3-body interaction to the hamiltonian for each spin ( so @xmath47 interactions ) .",
    "since the initial state for the combined system is one with finite @xmath7 , it is closer to the ground state with high overlap than a random initial condition so bp has a better chance of reaching the ground state .",
    "past some critical channel noise we expect there to be an ergodicity breaking transition corresponding to replica symmetry breaking , at which point the update equations ( [ eq : cavityupdates_rs ] ) will no longer be sufficient to correctly characterise the system .",
    "for example , if we consider the initial stage of the algorithm where messages are passed purely between sites and 2-body links then it is known that for @xmath42 ( three 2-body interactions ) the at - transition occurs at @xmath48 @xcite . below this point a survey propagation algorithm @xcite should improve at least the initial overlap @xmath7 ( the at - point for the full system will not be the same as that for the initial system ) - at most until the transition from the mixed phase ( glassy ferromagnetic pure states ) to the spin glass phase . by considering the finite temperature replica symmetric transition lines away from the paramagnetic phase , a bifurcation analysis of the belief propagation equations yields critical temperatures for the @xmath42 regular sourlas code : @xmath49 which implies the triple point is at @xmath50 .",
    "according to the parisi - toulouse hypothesis of no re - entrance this gives us the zero temperature transition point between the mixed phase and the spin glass phase .    at the first level of replica symmetry breaking , survey propagation with parisi s replica symmetry breaking parameter equal to @xmath51 ( spx ) rather than solving for a single message from sites to links ( and links to sites ) we have to solve for a distribution of messages",
    "this distribution is over the messages in different ergodic sectors .",
    "while true ergodicity breaking will not occur in a finite length message , the breaking effects are sufficiently strong to mean that it does occur to all intents and purposes on any practical timescale for a message of reasonable length .",
    "the key idea behind the spx is that when performing an iteration of our messages , the energies in different ergodic sectors will vary , and as they vary the probability of finding such a given state also varies .",
    "the spx equations keep track of these changes assuming that the true nature of the states is 1rsb ( which is not necessarily the case ) .",
    "if we again restrict ourselves to integer values for the messages ( so in fact the integrals are really sums over the appropriate domain ) then the iteration equations are : @xmath52 \\delta[h - \\sum_b u_b ] \\rme^{x    \\left|\\sum_b u_b\\right|}\\\\ q_{a { { \\rightarrow}}i}^t(u ) \\propto \\int [ \\prod_{j \\in a \\setminus i } \\rmd h_j p_{j    { { \\rightarrow}}a}^t(h_j ) ] \\delta[u - { { \\mbox{sign}}}(j_{a } \\prod_{j } h_j ) ] \\rme^{x    \\delta_{u,0 } } \\label{eq : spx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above pair of equations are iterated until convergence ( or for some sufficient number of iterations ) . at that point",
    "we can construct our estimate for the decoded message via : @xmath53 \\delta[h - \\sum_b u_b ] \\rme^{x    \\left|\\sum_b u_b\\right|}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the approach thus far has still left the choice of @xmath51 . in physical problems , the general approach is to extremeise the generalized free energy wrt @xmath51 @xcite as these states are the ground states of the system .",
    "however , despite using a physical approach , we are interested in the error correcting abilities of this system and it does not necessarily hold that extremising the zero temperature free energy corresponds to maximising the overlap @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , we have found that minimizing the energy @xmath54 gives a good guide to choice of @xmath51 which is reasonable since our initial aim was to decode via minimizing the energy of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "if the computational effort required to fit the model is prohibitive , choosing a particular value of @xmath51 for spx ( we found about 0.15 was reasonable ) still gives a marked improvement over bp in decoding across a range of channel noises @xmath45 . in figure",
    "[ fig : overlapvsx ] we plot variation in the overlap from its mean value to that of the energy and the free energy ( we take 10 times the variation of the free energy so that the scales are similar ) .",
    "the energy ( which is observable ) seems to give a reasonable indication of the overlap ( which is not observable in practical situations ) .",

    ". however , this is not feasible computationally .",
    "this does make the next obvious step a 2rsb algorithm , 2spxy , where the messages will be surveys of surveys . for a more detailed discussion on applications to @xmath55-sat see @xcite .",

    "we will compare these different approaches numerically in the following .",
    "in general there is no guarantee that bp will converge on a graph with loops .",
    "however , experimentally it appears that for large disordered random graphs the transition to non - convergence is closely linked to the at - transition  @xcite .",
    "one can also rationalise this in terms of correlation lengths .",
    "if the correlation length is less than log(@xmath61 ) then locally the graph appears to be a tree ( apart from at a finite number of sites ) , so bp should converge provided the graph is sufficiently large ( of course this is very large as the length scale is log(@xmath61 ) ) . below the at transition due to the proliferation of pure states",
    "there are necessarily correlations on all length scales throughout the graph , so one would not expect bp to converge as it is affected by the loops .",
    "one simple , robust approach to deal with estimation when bp has not converged is to use time averaged bp ( tabp ) , which corresponds to taking averages in time of the messages , and performing inference with these average messages @xcite .",

    "sp0 does not resort to any reweighing of messages as the messages are passed but gains its improvement from a `` majority rules '' approach .",
    "i.e. when decoding in a region where bp does not converge , inference is performed at each bit by using the majority decision of the different instances . for the fully connected cdma problem ,",
    "the local fields are gaussian and it is possible to show analytically that sp0 improves inference compared to bp analytically  @xcite . in the present situation due to the finite connectivity nature of the problem",
    "the effective fields are not gaussian distributed , thus we have not been able to show that sp0 improves on bp analytically ( basically we do not have sufficiently general control of @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , in the high @xmath1 limit our present model reduces to the sk - model @xcite and in this case we again find that sp0 is strictly better in inference terms than bp below the at - line , which is shown in appendix a.    in fact , tabp and sp0 are intuitively quite similar .",
    "the first averages over bp states in time , while the latter averages over different bp states in parallel from different initial conditions and with mixing of different solutions at each update step . provided the dynamics of bp are sufficiently chaotic that it explores all states one could expect both averages to give similar ( or even identical ) results . to test this hypothesis we compare the distribution of local fields given by sp0 to the distribution given by tabp .",

    "[ fig : distances ] we look at @xmath62 vs @xmath51 and see that we find very good agreement for the hypothesis that sp0 is equivalent to tabp which gives an alternative explanation to its improved performance over bp and provides an new method for implementing sp0 .",
    "( 200,105 ) ( 0,10)=80 ( 57,6)(0,0)@xmath45 ( -10,50)(0,0)@xmath7    we have used four different algorithms for the initial decoding , bp , tabp ( or sp0 ) , spx and 2spxy , corresponding to different levels of replica symmetry breaking and model fitting . for each algorithm there is essentially only one pertinent question which is whether the overlap reached after initial decoding is sufficient to lead to good full decoding .",
    "while it is tempting to think of some critical @xmath7 - in reality this is not sufficient to describe the state in full detail and other factors such as @xmath45 and the decoding algorithms themselves will all contribute to changes in the @xmath7 required ( in addition to finite size fluctuations ) to reach the high overlap state .",
    "however , due to issues of computational complexity we have tested all four algorithms on the initial decoding only .",
    "the 2spxy algorithm has only been investigated very briefly there , for a single value of @xmath51 and @xmath59 rather than optimising over them for each codeword received .",
    "we compare the results of these initial overlaps in figure [ fig : initial_mag ] .",
    "we see that each improvement in the algorithm does lead to an increased overlap after the initial stage , between the beginning of the mixed phase and the at point .",
    "the 2spxy does appear ( as far as we can tell from the data ) to give an improvement on the spx algorithm for a limited range of channel noise .",
    "next we look in figure [ fig : final_mag ] at the final overlap reached after full decoding with bp , sp0 and spx .",
    "we see that improving the quality of the algorithm leads to a marked improvement in the critical channel noise enlarging the space for which the cascading code approach will work .",

    "we have examined how taking replica symmetry breaking into account can improve decoding of cascading sourlas codes .",
    "the basis behind our idea is that below the at transition , the true overlap at the minima of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is above its replica symmetric estimate so increasing steps of replica symmetry breaking will serve to improve the overlap between the estimate of the message and the true message .",
    "we have also shown that tabp is closely related ( if not identical ) to sp0 - this throws up two obvious areas for further investigation , one to find under what conditions these algorithms are identical and secondly to show that both of them are strict improvements on bp below the at transition generally .",
    "another area to improve is in terms of the 2sp , where further optimisation of the parisi parameters should lead to further improvements , albeit at some considerable computational cost .",
    "the graph structure used here is not expected to be optimal - after the initial stage using higher body interactions ( i.e. @xmath66 ) should give improvements in the final overlap , optimising over possible architectures should also improve matters , but the principles developed here will help in any case where the channel noise is sufficiently high that decoding is taking place below the at transition .",
