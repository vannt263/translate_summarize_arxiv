    "humans are often very sensitive to discrepancies in size estimates ( size constancy  @xcite ) and draw or imagine objects in canonical sizes , despite significant variations due to a change in viewpoint or distance  @xcite . considering the importance of size information in human vision , it is counter - intuitive that most of the current ai systems are agnostic to object sizes .",
    "we postulate that this is mainly due to the lack of a comprehensive resource that can provide information about object sizes . in this paper , we introduce a method to automatically provide such information by representing and inferring object sizes and their relations . to be comprehensive , our method does not rely on explicit human supervision and only uses web data .",

    "we use size graph , shown above , to represent both absolute size information ( from textual web data ) and relative ones ( from visual web data ) .",
    "the size graph allows us to leverage the transitive nature of size information by maximizing the likelihood of both visual and textual observations.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0%]-.3 cm    -.2 cm [ fig : teaser ]    identifying numerical properties of objects , such as size , has been recently studied in natural language processing and shown to be helpful for question answering and information extraction  @xcite .",
    "the core idea of the state - of - the - art methods is to design search queries in the form of manually defined templates either looking for absolute size of objects ( e.g. `` the size of a car is * unit '' ) or specific relations ( e.g. `` wheel of a car '' ) .",
    "the results are promising , but the quality and scale of such extraction has been somewhat limiting .",
    "for example , these methods predict a relatively small size for a ` car ' because search queries discover more frequent relations about the size of a ` toy car ' rather than a regular ` car '  @xcite .",
    "this is in part because most trivial commonsense knowledge is rarely stated explicitly in natural language text , e.g. , it is unlikely to find a sentence that says a car is bigger than an orange .",
    "in addition , comparative statements in text , if found , rarely provide precisely how much one object is bigger than the other . in this paper",
    ", we argue that visual and textual observations are complementary , and a successful size estimation method will take advantage of both modalities . in images , estimating the absolute sizes of objects requires information about the camera parameters and accurate depth estimates which are not available at scale .",
    "visual data , however , can provide informative cues about relative sizes of objects .",
    "for example , consider the ` cat ' that is sitting by the ` window ' in figure  [ fig : teaser ] .",
    "the relative size of the ` cat ' and the ` window ' can be computed using their detection boxes , adjusted by their coarse depth . a probability distribution over relative sizes of ` cats ' and ` windows '",
    "can then be computed by observing several images in which ` cats ' and ` windows ' co - occur . however , not all pairs of objects appear in large enough number of images . collecting visual observations for some pairs like ` sofa ' and ` tree '",
    "is not possible .",
    "furthermore , it is not scalable to collect visual observations for all pairs of objects .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a method to learn to estimate sizes of objects , with no explicit human supervision , leveraging both textual and visual observations .",
    "our approach is to couple ( noisy ) textual and visual estimates and use the transitive nature of size information to reason about objects that do nt co - occur frequently .",
    "for example in figure  [ fig : teaser ] , our method can establish inferences about the relative size of ` sofa ' and ` tree ' through a set of intermediate relations between ` sofa'-`cat ' and ` cat'-`tree ' .",
    "we introduce _ size graph _ as our representation to model object sizes and their relations .",
    "the nodes in the size graph correspond to the log - normal distribution of the sizes of objects and edges correspond to relative sizes of pairs of objects that co - occur frequently .",
    "the topology of the size graph provides guidance on how to collect enough textual and visual observations to deal with the noise and sparsity of the observations .",
    "we formulate the problem of learning the size of the objects as optimizing for a set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of both textual and visual observations . to obtain large scale visual observations we use detectors trained without explicit annotations using webdata  @xcite and single image depth estimators that are pretrained using few categories and have shown to be generalizable to unseen categories .",

    "a few researchers  @xcite use manually curated commonsense knowledge base such as opencyc  @xcite for answering questions about numerical information .",
    "these knowledge resources ( e.g. , conceptnet  @xcite ) usually consist of taxonomic assertions or generic relations , but do not include size information .",
    "manual annotations of such knowledge is not scalable .",
    "our efforts will result in extracting size information to populate such knowledge bases ( esp .",
    "conceptnet ) with size information at scale .",
    "identifying numerical attributes about objects has been addressed in nlp recently .",
    "the common theme in the recent work  @xcite is to use search query templates with other textual cues ( e.g. , more than , at least , as many as , etc ) , collect numerical values , and model sizes as a normal distribution .",
    "however , the quality and scale of such extraction is somewhat limiting . similar to previous work that show textual and visual information are complementary across different domains  @xcite , we show that a successful size estimation method should also take advantage of both modalities .",
    "in particular , our experiments show that textual observations about the relative sizes of objects are very limited , and relative size comparisons are better collected through visual data . in addition , we show that log - normal distribution is a better model for representing sizes than normal distributions .    in computer vision ,",
    "size information manually extracted from furniture catalogs , has shown to be effective in indoor scenes understanding and reconstruction  @xcite . however",
    ", size information is not playing a major role in mainstream computer vision tasks yet .",
    "this might be due to the fact that there is no unified and comprehensive resource for objects sizes .",

    "in particular , the size graph should have the following properties :    connectivity , which allows us to take advantage of the transitivity of size and propagate any size information throughout the graph .",
