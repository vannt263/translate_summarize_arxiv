    "high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are defined as hi gas which have anomalous velocities that are incompatible with what is expected from a simple galactic rotation model .",
    "ever since their discovery by @xcite , their role in the formation and evolution of our galaxy has been a source of speculation . amongst the attempts to explain their origin ,",
    "the two most well - known and contested are the galactic fountain model , in which gas is either being thrown out of the galactic disk from supernovae or being heated and ionized by massive stars , and the alternative model in which the clouds are pockets of neutral hydrogen left over from the formation epoch of the galaxy , and which are only now being accreted .    given the vast sky - coverage of hvcs , the two theories are not necessarily contradictory , as it is likely that some clouds belong to each model . however , with the exception of those hvcs that are obvious components of a stream with a known progenitor , such as the magellanic @xcite and sagittarius streams @xcite , the lack of distance measurements has hindered the progress in understanding the role that hvcs play in the galaxy",
    ".    since newly accreted gas would have a lower metallicity than recycled gas from the galaxy , metallicity measurements , if available , should be able to distinguish the applicability of each theory on a cloud - by - cloud basis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it would still be instructive to know exactly where these clouds lie .",
    "observationally , the difficulty in determining direct distances arises from the fact that most of the hvcs do not host stars .",
    "if , however , there is one star behind and another to the front of the cloud along the line of sight , both of which have known distances , then a distance bracket can be set for the hvc .",
    "the high resolution spectrum of a star directly behind the hvc will exhibit absorption lines at the velocity of that cloud ; features that will be absent in the spectrum of a star to the front of the cloud .",
    "starting with the first such measurement for complex m in the early 90 s @xcite , other hvc complexes for which a distance bracket that now exists include complex a @xcite and complex wb @xcite .",
    "the high latitudes of much of the neutral hydrogen gas in question means there is a lack of background stars bright enough for high resolution spectroscopy , so this technique has not been without difficulty .",
    "many detailed simulations of streams such as the magellanic stream exist , however , all such simulations have many parameters which must be tweaked to give the best fits to the data . in this paper , we describe an alternative set of methods with the aim of probing the elusive distances to streams of hi gas comprising the hvcs .",
    "these methods instead make strong hypotheses that enable us to attempt to read the distances out of the data themselves ; the studies presented here are neither simulations nor attempts at modelling .",
    "the following section introduces the geometrodynamical methods for determining distances to streams of hvcs and discusses which streams are appropriate for each method .",
    "we developed the methods in response to a challenge laid down by majewski , who asked whether it was possible to determine distances from radial velocities alone , when those were known along a stream @xcite . in section [ subsec : masterpoints ] , we consider distant streams and use heliocentric radial velocities corrected to the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) as a lowest order approximation to the galactocentric radial velocities . section [ sec : velcor ] shows how these radial velocities can be corrected iteratively , and shows that the corrections are negligible for the magellanic stream .",
    "the choice of galactic potential is briefly discussed in section [ sec : potential ] . on the assumption that the magellanic stream is composed of material that was torn off the magellanic clouds at an earlier passage through perigalacticon , it seems reasonable to assume an angular momentum gradient to be present along the length of the stream ; this topic is addressed in section [ sec : deltah ] .",
    "we present our summary and conclusions in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "there is a great body of literature on streams and associations of bodies in planes through the galactic centre .",
    "the sagittarius stream @xcite features prominently in this literature , however it is not relevant to the methods developed here which work off the parallax due to the sun s displacement from the plane of the orbit .",
    "this displacement is almost zero for the sagittarius stream .",
    "some frequently used symbols and their definitions are summarised in table [ tab : defs ] with a schematic guide to a generic point on the stream given by figure [ fig : schematic ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     -component of the angular momentum for points along the magellanic stream is plotted against distance along the stream in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "an explanation of the error bars is given in the main text .",
    "[ fig : angmom],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      if a stream exhibits two @xmath1 points , as suggested by the velocity field of complex c presented by @xcite , we have yet another possible variation on a theme .",
    "let us denote the unit directional vector for a @xmath2 point as @xmath3 .",
    "then , by using the fact that @xmath3 for both points lie in the plane of the stream , we can find the normal @xmath4 to the plane as    [ eqn : norm2 ] * * = .",
    "+ as before , the absolute distance of the plane from us is found by constraining the galactic centre to be in the plane . we know that at the points , @xmath5 , and equation ( [ eqn : d ] ) applies to each of the points .",
    "the problem then reduces down to finding the @xmath6 vectors .",
    "from page 31 of @xcite , we have an all - sky aitoff projection map of the high - velocity clouds . by eye , it is possible to draw what would appear to be the directional line of the stream , especially as the stream is so long .",
    "we can hence draw a directional ` vector ' from each of the points .",
    "consider the first point given by galactic coordinates @xmath7 and a close - by point along this ` vector ' , whose coordinates are given by @xmath8 ; @xmath9 will then be given by the vector joining these two points .",
    "consider the celestial sphere of radius @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "for the moment , @xmath13 is an unknown .",
    "however , since @xmath14 , then by substitution and rearrangement , we find that @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that    _ 1 = - * * _ 1",
    ". + by evaluating the cross product @xmath16 and normalising , the unit normal to the plane may be found .",
    "we now have a way of determining the distance to any point on the stream by using equation ( [ eqn : d ] ) , which is general and not confined to the points .",
    "it does not assume that the path of the stream is confined to an orbit of constant energy and angular momentum , however we require the stream to be in a planar configuration as in all previous methods .      .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath0 axes shown here are nearly parallel to the galactic @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes respectively . [",
    "fig : complexc],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the velocity field of complex c is given by figure 4 of @xcite , from which we interpolate the following two points : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "with the following choice for associated points to find the apparent direction vectors for each of the points  @xmath22 and @xmath23  we find the normal to the supposed plane of this complex to be @xmath24 and a set of distances to the stream with a range of @xmath25 under this method , as shown in figure [ fig : complexc ] .",
    "the stream has a significant width , across which there is some non - negligible scatter in the velocities .",
    "it is slightly concerning that some of the clouds are rather close - by and yet they already have negative line - of - sight velocities .",
    "for example , the range of gsr velocities at @xmath26 ranges from -20 to@xmath27 , while at @xmath28 the range is -50 to @xmath29 . it is somewhat unlikely that these clouds would be able to wrap around to the other side of the galactic centre with such infalling velocities .",
    "the near method in section [ subsec : near ] applied to complex c gave similar but slightly smaller distances .",
    "both the current treatment and the near method have likely given distances which are too small to be plausible .",
    "we deduce that complex c is not a stream lying in a plane through the galactic centre .",
    "the method discussed in section [ subsec : masterpoints ] was revisited , but with a correction now applied to the velocities in order to account for our offset from the galactic centre .",
    "whereas previously the heliocentric line - of - sight velocities corrected to the gsr were used in the energy equation , we now corrected these iteratively to actual galactocentric radial velocities .",
    "we first calculated , using line - of - sight velocities , the zeroth order distances to the stream clouds . with the three - dimensional configuration of the stream",
    "then known to lowest order , we could transform to planar coordinates with the suppressed axis corresponding to the normal to the stream plane as defined by the three fiducial points ( see section [ subsec : masterpoints ] for definition ) .",
    "we discounted the third dimension  vertical offsets from the stream plane  on the basis that these deviations were small relative to both components in the plane and overall distance of the stream from the galactic centre .",
    "we then know the approximate direction in which a particular point in the stream is moving , assuming no motion into or out of the plane .",
    "this assumption was reasonable given the size of the vertical offsets .",
    "the component of the true velocity projected along our line of sight gives the observed velocity @xmath30 , since radial velocities are taken to be positive if they are outwards , hence an appropriate de - projection of @xmath30 gives the ` true ' velocity .",
    "this can then be re - projected along the radial vector from the galactic centre to the stream point to give the corrected radial velocity .",
    "we found the line - of - sight velocities to have been a slight under - estimate on the galactocentric radial velocities for the magellanic stream .",
    "the maximum change in galactocentric distance as a result of this velocity correction is approximately @xmath31 for the farthest point , and the smaller distances are less affected , on average by less than @xmath32 .",
    "we conclude that the size of the corrections , which are presented in table [ tab : stream ] , are small in comparison with errors that might result from the choice of method to derive the distances .    by calculating the ` true ' velocity vector , we were also able to calculate the angular momentum vector at each point along the stream . in figure",
    "[ fig : angmom ] , the magnitude of the @xmath17-component of the angular momentum is plotted as a function of distance along the stream , where the @xmath17 axis is parallel to the normal to the stream plane , and nearly parallel to the galactic @xmath18 axis .    in order to determine the component of velocity along the stream",
    ", we require the angle between the stream and the vector transverse to the radial vector .",
    "this can be determined from figure [ fig : stream ] .",
    "since the angular momentum depends on the cotangent of this angle , the errors on the angular momenta are derived from assuming a @xmath33 error in this angle . near the perigalacticon ,",
    "the angle becomes close to @xmath34 .",
    "for such points , the associated errors become very large ; these points have not been plotted .",
    "figure [ fig : angmom ] shows that the angular momentum along the stream is consistent with being constant within the errors .",
    "we now address the issue of the choice of potential used . until now , we have assumed a simple logarithmic potential giving a constant circular velocity . it is instructive to check whether this is an over - simplification and we should instead be using a potential which has a power - law dependence on the galactocentric distance . as with the radial velocity correction above",
    ", the baseline for our check is the method given in section [ subsec : masterpoints ] .",
    "the following equation results from using properties of the @xmath35 point in combination with a rearrangement of equation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) with @xmath36 :    1 + ( ) ^- x^-2 - ( 1 - x^- ) = 0 , where @xmath37 and all other variables have the same definitions as before .    when the constant @xmath38 is set to a small positive quantity , a small negative correction results for the galactocentric distances .",
    "for example , @xmath39 shifts the distances found with the logarithmic potential down by approximately 0.7 kpc and @xmath40 shifts the distances by approximately 7 kpc .",
    "it is instructive to find the range of values of @xmath38 that is consistent with acceptable values of the galaxy s mass out to @xmath41 , @xmath42 . imposing the total mass within this radius and a circular velocity at the sun",
    "automatically imposes the steepness of the density profile . since @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "if we ask , for example , that @xmath38 be consistent with @xmath46 , which is consistent with values given by @xcite , then @xmath38 is restricted to values between 0.14 and @xmath47 . employing a smaller mass for the galaxy would raise the value of @xmath38 .",
    "if , for example , the mass range given above were applied at @xmath48 , then the value of corresponding @xmath38 would range between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the actual range is narrower when physical demands are incorporated , such as that the magellanic clouds should not be at ridiculously small distances and that we should perhaps expect the circular velocity to taper off gradually between the solar position and the distance at which the farthest point on the stream resides .",
    "we would , for example , expect @xmath38 to be no greater than 0.1 in order that the distance to the magellanic clouds are not too discrepant with observationally determined values .",
    "in previous sections , we have assumed all of the material comprising the stream to be following the same orbit , with the same value of angular momentum and energy being applicable along the entire length of the stream .",
    "we now investigate the effect of relaxing this constraint .",
    "if the material forming the magellanic stream had been stripped from the clouds at the last passage through perigalacticon , the material must have undergone a change in energy and angular momentum in order for the observed streaming shape to have formed .",
    "there is an observed lag of approximately @xmath51 of the end of the stream relative to the position of the magellanic clouds .",
    "in the course of a tidal tearing , the outer parts of the victim are torn off by the strong tides close to pericentre .",
    "for a small victim , the tidal debris will have almost the same pericentre as the remnant of the victim .",
    "thus the energies and angular momenta of the tidal debris are related by the condition of all having the same pericentre distance .",
    "an alternative interesting way of seeing this is to imagine that near pericentre , where the tearing occurs , it is sufficient to treat the potential under which the debris moves as that of two bodies rotating about one another with angular velocity @xmath52 . in reality",
    "the rotation rate varies , but it will come to a maximum at pericentre so it will not be a great error to treat it as constant near there . now an orbit in the field of two bodies rotating around one another at constant angular velocity @xmath52 will have a constant jacobi integral ( or energy relative to the rotating axes ) . the quantity @xmath53 will be conserved as debris leave the victim .",
    "this implies that those that gain most angular momentum @xmath54 from lagging just behind the victim will gain energy @xmath55 .",
    "this argument leads to essentially the same conclusion as the demand that the perigalactica of all the debris be the same .",
    "hence when we deal with debris spread along the orbit , we change both energy and angular momentum in proportion and use @xmath54 as our parameter .",
    "we continue to use a generalised potential of the following form in the energy equation , now with an explicit constant : [ eqn : genpot ] ( r ) = .",
    "+ differentiating the potential and using the fact that the square of the circular speed at radius @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 gives the equation @xmath58 .",
    "since we have both a value for the circular speed at the location of the sun and its distance from the galactic centre , @xmath59 can be calculated given a value for @xmath38 ; the potential at a given radius is then known .",
    "we can rearrange the energy equation by using @xmath60 to obtain :    [ eqn : u ] u^2 + u^2 = ( ( u ) + ) , + where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath61 .",
    "using equations ( [ eqn : energy ] ) , ( [ eqn : genpot ] ) and ( [ eqn : u ] ) for the peri- and apogalacticon gives the following equation for the angular momentum @xmath62 :    [ eqn : h ] h^2 = .",
    "+ keeping the assumption that the clouds and stream lie in a planar configuration , the orbit of the clouds can be computed for a given perigalacticon and apogalacticon .",
    "the constant @xmath38 in the potential was set to 0.01 .",
    "note that it is not strictly necessary to have an absolute value of @xmath59 if we only require relative values of angular momenta .",
    "the true current position of the clouds was estimated to be approximately 0.7 rad from the perigalacticon that the clouds have just passed through ; we refer to this angle as the ` offset ' angle .",
    "note that more than half of the stream material lies on the other side of this perigalacticon . in the orbital computation , we know the time it has taken for the clouds to cover the distance from the initial perigalacticon  where we assume the material for the stream was originally stripped  to their current position . during the same period in time",
    ", the end of the stream must have covered a smaller angle in the sky in order to have left the observable lag - angle of approximately @xmath51 , despite having started at the same location .",
    "we took a fixed perigalacticon distance for the clouds and investigated the effect that changing the distance to apogalacticon has on the total change in angular momentum that occurs along the stream .",
    "for @xmath63 of between 80 and 180@xmath64 and a fixed @xmath65 of 45 , we find a simple relationship between @xmath63 and @xmath66 through a fit of the following form :    = ( ) ^b ; a 19.4;b 1.55 , + where @xmath54 now specifically refers to the absolute change in angular momentum from the clouds to a point @xmath51 downstream .",
    "the largest difference in angular momentum arises from the least eccentric orbits . for an assumed apogalacticon of @xmath67 for the magellanic clouds , we find that @xmath68 , implying a 6% difference in the angular momentum between the extreme ends of the stream . for these choices of parameters ,",
    "the clouds would be positioned at @xmath69 and the end of the stream at @xmath70 .",
    "changing only the perigalacticon to @xmath71 brings the clouds slightly further in to @xmath72 and a slightly smaller value of @xmath66 .",
    "we find that the distance in an unperturbed orbit to the same azimuthal position relative to the magellanic clouds as the end point is only of order @xmath73 less than that for the perturbed orbit .      by allowing for a gradient in the angular momentum along the length of the stream",
    ", the angular position of the current perigalacticon will be different between the clouds and the end of the stream , even though , by design , the distance of closest approach to the galactic centre will remain the same .",
    "when setting an offset angle for the clouds , which is taken relative to the current perigalacticon , it is important to remember that the location of perigalacticon gradually shifts along the stream .",
    "we have checked that its difference for the extreme ends of the stream is merely @xmath74 and hence there is little error in measuring the offset angle from the perigalacticon of the computed magellanic clouds orbit , as opposed to an averaged value .",
    "using the first set of parameters described in the section above , we have also checked the effect of altering the offset angle by a few percent to ensure that an error in determining this value from observational data and calculations described in section [ subsec : masterpoints ] would not lead to a significant error in @xmath66 .",
    "we find that the percentage difference in this quantity resulting from a @xmath75 change in the offset angle is tiny , on the order of a few hundredths of a percent .",
    "an under - estimation of the offset angle by @xmath76 produces a greater error , on the order of a few tenths of a percent of @xmath66 .",
    "this is as expected , given that changes in velocity over the same angle occurs more rapidly when closer to perigalacticon than when further away .",
    "the change in angular momentum that would be required to keep the end of the stream far enough away therefore becomes slightly larger .",
    "even for the under - estimation case , however , the errors are still relatively small .",
    "one other point to note is that the concept of an @xmath35 point , defined previously as the location on the orbital stream with the highest radial velocity , is now void .",
    "this is because the stream material is not following the same orbit as that of the clouds .",
    "a check to see whether the projected line - of - sight velocity at the tip of the stream , earlier coined the @xmath35 point , is consistent with the observed value at that location served as an independent test of the validity of the approach used to exploit the lag - angle in calculating the angular momentum deviation .",
    "we have applied a variety of geometrodynamical methods to streams of high - velocity clouds in an attempt to constrain their distances . some of these methods , including the near method , have the nice feature that distance determinations would be possible without the parameter dependency inherent in any simulations .",
    "we find , however , that the near method in particular becomes rather inaccurate when the angle subtended at the stream by @xmath77 becomes small . at the expense of becoming more model dependent by assuming a halo form for the galactic potential , we have improved on this accuracy .",
    "we then find distances to the entire length of the magellanic stream by assuming that the gas comprising the stream nearly follows a planar orbit about the galactic centre .",
    "we find the perigalacticon to be at @xmath78 and the maximum distance at the trailing end to be @xmath79 .",
    "the heliocentric distances are not very different from the galactocentric distances , varying typically by @xmath32 or less .",
    "the centre - of - mass of the magellanic clouds would be at @xmath80 from us , according to this method ; this is consistent with various observationally determined values for the large magellanic cloud ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "application of our methods to complex a and c did not yield very promising results under the assumptions that were made .",
    "this indicates that our hypothesis , namely that the streams were nearly following an orbit around the galactic centre in a well - defined plane , was not valid for these two streams of high - velocity clouds .    in this paper",
    ", we have tested the idea that streams of hvcs follow orbits .",
    "however the assumption that the orbit lies in a plane that passes through the galactic centre is rather restrictive when applied to nearby streams that do not pass close to the galactic pole .",
    "it is possible to remove the restriction of a planar orbit , provided a model of the galaxy s potential is given .",
    "we find that the transverse velocity of the stream can be deduced from the run of radial velocities as a function of angle along the stream , provided the distance to one point of the stream is assumed .",
    "orbits can then be computed in the given potential . both directions in the sky and radial velocities",
    "are then computed and these are compared with the observations . such a method and an example of its application to complex a and the stellar orphan stream has already been presented @xcite .",
    "we note that such methods of deriving the transverse velocity component were used in a related problem by , but probably date back to an earlier century .",
    "we are also exploring the possible existence of stream associations . following on from these works",
    ", we hope , eventually , to give a definitive answer to the question of whether high - velocity cloud streams follow orbits around the galaxy .",

    "<S> applying this technique to the large magellanic cloud itself gives an independent distance which agrees within its accuracy of around 10% . </S>",
    "<S> relaxing the demand for exact conservation of energy and angular momentum at all points along the stream allows for an increase in orbital period between the lagging end and the front end led by the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> similar methods are applicable to other long streams of high - velocity clouds , provided they also nearly follow planar orbits ; these would allow otherwise unknown distances to be determined .    </S>",
