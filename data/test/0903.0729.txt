    "there is ample evidence that the conditions under which galaxies formed at high redshift where quite different to those at later times during the evolution of the universe .",
    "impressive evidence supporting such a view has been lately collected from detailed integral field spectroscopy of @xmath1 galaxies ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "2006 , genzel et al .",
    "these observations reveal massive , high star forming galaxies that show rotational structure that resemble those of disk galaxies .",
    "in contrast to low redshift disk galaxies however , the ratio of gas rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is only of the order few compared to @xmath2 at low z. furthermore it has been well established by now , that the star formation rate in the universe is a declining function of time ( hopkins 2004 ) and that this is driven by a _ down - sizing _ in the average star formation rate of galaxies of a given mass as a function of time ( juneau et al 2005 , noeske et al .",
    "2007 ) . besides star formation ,",
    "merger rates ( e.g. le fvre et al 2000 ) and agn activity ( hasinger et al . 2007 ) show an upward trend with redshift , peaking around @xmath3 indicating the importance of the high - z universe for the assembly and formation of galaxies . that indeed a large fraction of the stellar mass of massive galaxies is already in place at @xmath4 finds it support from studies of their stellar population ( thomas et al .",
    "2005 ) and the evolution of the mass density in units of the @xmath5 mass density ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the hierarchical @xmath6cdm paradigm has been successful in predicting and reproducing several of the above mentioned trends .",
    "in particular the increasing merger fraction as a function of redshift is a natural outcome ( kb2001 , ks2008 , farouhki ma ) of this model and driven by the merging history of the underlying dark matter halos . with respect to the evolution of baryonic physics within such evolving haloes early work by ( binney 1977 , silk 1977 , rees & ostriker 1977 ) laid out the ground work .",
    "radiative cooling and the collapse into a rotationally supported disk of initial hot gas at the halos virial temperature , followed by star formation in this disk where the main mechanism to build up galaxies .",
    "besides its simplifying assumption , e.g. about spherical symmetry of the halo , its profile and other properties of the dark matter and associated gas infall , these models proved to be very successful in predicting galaxy properties and in particular a transition mass scale at which galaxy formation becomes very inefficient due to long radiative cooling times of the gas ( dekel & birnboim 2006 ) , thus causing star formation to slow down or even halt . in comparison to detailed high resolution numerical simulations",
    "these models have shown to predict cooling rates too low by a factor of a few , especially in low mass halos and at early times ( keres et al 2005 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed partly to the geometry of the accretion process in cosmological simulations which is not necessarily spherical symmetric as assumed in simplified models , but follows the cosmic filaments .",
    "however , the essence of the accretion process of cold gas at high redshift can be summarized by fast and efficient , on the host halos dynamical time . in effect",
    "cold gas is accreted with a rate comparable to the dark matter accretion rate times the cosmological baryon fraction @xmath7",
    ". this situation will not hold in massive halos however , where stable shocks heat the infalling gas to the halos virial temperature and cooling times are longer than the dynamical time , and neither at late times when already a substantial fraction of baryons have made it into stars . in the following section we will investigate the impact this efficient provision of cold gas has on the evolution and formation of galaxies .",
    "we use the semi - analytic model _",
    "simurgh _ to model the formation and evolution of galaxies .",

    ", we assume that elliptical galaxies form whenever a major merger ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) takes place .",
    "we assume that during this process , all the cold gas in the progenitor disks will be consumed in a central starburst , adding to the spheroid mass , and that all stars in the progenitor disks will contribute to the spheroid as well .",
    "furthermore , we also add the stars of satellite galaxies involved in minor mergers to the spheroid .",
    "the merger time scale for galaxies is calculated using the dynamical friction prescription in springel et al .",

    "please note that our simulation does not include agn - feedback ( schawinski et al .",
    "2006 ) or environmental effects ( khochfar & ostriker 2007 ) that have influence on the most massive galaxies . throughout this paper , we use the following set of cosmological parameters derived from a combination of the 5-year wmap data with type ia supernovae and measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations ( komatsu et al .",

    "the widely accepted explanation is that feedback from supernovae is hindering star formation in low mass haloes .",
    "the rational behind this argument is that the specific energy of hot gas is lower in low mass halos and therefor the amount of cold gas reheated per supernovae is larger than in massive halos ( dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "the way that supernovae operate per solar mass stars formed is independent of redshift considering the same stellar initial mass function , thus it comes as a surprise that observations with the hubble space telescope a steepening of the slope with redshift ( ryan et al . 2007 ) .    in fig . 1",

    "we infer only a very modest change in @xmath24 for reasonable choices of feedback efficiencies , and therefore conclude that another process must be responsible for the observed evolution in @xmath24 .",
    "the mass function of dark matter halos is known to show a strong evolution with redshift .",
    "the galaxies contributing to the luminosity function around @xmath26 are mostly central galaxies in their dark matter halos , i.e. the most luminous galaxy within the halo ( e.g. khochfar & ostriker 2008 ) .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to assume a connection between the evolution of @xmath24 and that of the dark matter mass function .",
    "when considering the luminosity of central galaxies residing in dark matter halos of the same mass at different redshifts , we find that at early times , central galaxies are up to three magnitudes brighter than their counterparts in low redshift halos ( see fig .",
    "1 right upper panel ) .",
    "this is even the case for halos hosting sub-@xmath26 galaxies .",
    "similar results have been reported by ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2007 ) , who showed that dwarf galaxies at early times are not affected by supernova feedback in their simulations because cooling times are very short in these halos and the energy injected by the supernovae is rapidly dissipated away .",
    "the slope in the region of dark matter halos that host sub-@xmath26 galaxies is steeper at high redshift , and consequently so is @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "1 right lower panel ) .",
    "the same is true for other choices supernovae feedback and star formation efficiency , thereby explaining why we do not find any strong dependence of @xmath24 on these parameters .",
    "various observational surveys have revealed that elliptical galaxies are more compact at high - z ( trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ) . a natural way to explain such a behavior is the combination of dissipation during merger , which drives gas to the centre of the remnant and makes it more compact than in the case of no dissipation ( cox et al .",
    "2006 , khochfar & silk 2006b ) and the continued accretion of satellites that puff up the host galaxy ( naab et al .",
    "2007 , khochfar & silk 2006b ) .",
    "we find that in general the average gas fractions in mergers increase from @xmath27 in massive mergers at @xmath5 to up to @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to that we find that massive galaxies have an order of magnitude more minor than major mergers .",
    "to estimate the size evolution we adopt a model in which the relative size of to remnants of the same mass is proportional the relative amount of dissipation they encountered during their merging history . in this way",
    "a remnant of a gas - rich merger is more compact than that of a gas poor merger and equally a remnant of many gas - poor satellite mergers is less compact than that of a major merger involving gas .    in fig 2",
    "we calculate the size evolution for the same redshifts presented in trujillo et al .",
    "the authors took the mean effective radii of the @xmath30 distribution for galaxies above two mass thresholds of @xmath31 m@xmath32 and @xmath33 m@xmath32 from the sdds sample of early - type galaxies and divided the effective radii of early - type galaxies at higher redshifts by this value . after arranging their galaxies in various redshift bins they calculated the means of these ratios and presented these values .",
    "we here use the same method to compare our results to theirs . for both cases of limiting masses",
    ", the agreement is excellent .",
    "it appears that the difference in sizes is more significant for massive early type galaxies . in the right part of fig 2",
    "we predict the size - evolution in four different mass ranges based on the relative amount of their merger component",
    ". while local early - type galaxies between @xmath34 m@xmath32 and @xmath35 m@xmath32 are around 1.25 times larger than their counterparts at @xmath36 , local early types with masses larger than @xmath37 m@xmath32 will be approximately 4 times larger than their counterparts at @xmath36 .",
    "this dramatic change in sizes in our model results from massive galaxies at high redshifts forming in gas - rich mergers while galaxies of the same mass at low redshifts form from dry major mergers ( khochfar & burkert 2003 , naab et al .",
    "2006 ) and minor mergers with small total amounts of cold gas .",
    "it is interesting to note that models with a characteristic shut - off mass scale for cooling of gas predict dry mergers as the main mechanism to grow massive galaxies ( khochfar & silk 2008a ) and hence imply a large size evolution .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , observations reveal a large population of massive , high star forming disk galaxies with gas velocity dispersion of the order @xmath38 km / s ( genzel et al .",
    "one open question is how these velocity dispersion can be driven .",
    "possible explanations that have been put forward range from gas - rich galaxies mergers ( robertson & bullock 2008 ) , tapping into gravitational energy of the disk and supernovae feedback ( bournaud & elmegreen 2009 , dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) to the release of accretion energy by cold streams ( khochfar & silk 2008b ) .",
    "we here investigate latter assumption .",
    "numerical simulations by ocvirk et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that the fraction of cold accreted gas that makes it way down to 0.2 @xmath39 as a function of dark halo mass is roughly constant down to @xmath36 and a strong declining function of halo mass .",
    "we model this behavior by enforcing the simulation results onto the gas cooling rates in our model . this way we make sure to be consistent with the simulation results .",
    "furthermore , we assume that only cold accreted gas is able to deposit a fraction @xmath40 of its kinetic energy once it hits the galactic disk , while hot gas that radiatively cools down does not contribute . assuming equilibrium between the contributions from accretion and dissipation in the disk leads to a simplified expression for the gas velocity dispersion as @xmath41 with @xmath42 the cold accretion rate .",
    "we here assumed that the energy dissipation time scale in the galactic disk is proportional to the local dynamical time , and that the contribution to turbulence in the inter - stellar - medium from supernovae is negligible compared to the contribution from accretion , which is the case for high accretion rates that are found at @xmath4 . in the left of fig 3 .",
    "we show the predicted correlation between the ratio of disk rotational velocity and gas velocity @xmath43 and disk rotation @xmath44 from khochfar & silk ( 2008b ) .",
    "overlaid are various observations at high redshift showing good agreement between a model in which @xmath45 .",
    "this result indicates , that only a small fraction is actually necessary to drive sufficiently high turbulence .",
    "the strong incline of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 is a direct consequence of the smaller cold accretion fraction in massive halos , thus this model suggest that the functional form of the cold accretion fraction at high z directly relates to a correlation of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we presented results on the formation of galaxies and their properties at high redshift .",
    "we investigated the origin of the evolution of the faint - end luminosity function , finding that in our model it is mainly driven by the evolution of the underlying the dark matter mass function .",
    "low mass galaxies at high z occupy a range in dark matter halos that lies on a much steeper part of the dark matter mass function than their counterparts at low redshifts .",
    "this is the main reason for an evolution in the model faint - end slope .",
    "supernovae feedback on the other hand does not introduce an evolving faint - end slope , though it will change the slope to become shallower at the roughly same rate at all redshifts .",
    "an interesting possibility in this respect is the choice of imf . in the case of a top - heavy imf",
    "one would expect more feedback contribution .",
    "it has been argued , that the discrepancy between observed star formation rates and integrated stellar mass density in the universe can be reduced by applying a top - heavy imf at @xmath4 .",
    "our simulations however , show that an increase or decrease by a factor of few will not change the general trend of the faint - end slope with redshift , thus not drawing support to the notion of an imf change at high z.    we continued by focusing on the role that the available fuel for star formation plays .",
    "we showed that the formation of galaxies is more efficient at high redshifts , which is a direct result of the fast accretion of cold gas at high z. the accretion of cold gas at high z parallels that of the dark matter , and hence is much faster than at low redshift , resulting in high star formation rates that can be sustained to build up sufficient massive galaxies .",
    "further consequences of high gas fractions in galaxies at early times are galaxy mergers with large fraction of dissipation .",
    "such mergers have shown to be result in very compact remnants .",
    "we applied a simplified model that scales the sizes of remnants with the amount of available fuel during their merger history .",
    "such a model proves to be able to reproduce observed size - evolutions of early - type galaxies very well .",
    "we find the strongest size - evolution for the most massive galaxies @xmath46 m@xmath32 , making a factor of 4 evolution in their sizes from @xmath36 to @xmath5 .",
    "the main cause for this strong trend is the occurrence of very gas rich mergers at high z while the local counterparts formed rather recent from dry mergers and a large fraction of satellite galaxies that help to further puff up the host galaxy .",
    "the main mode of accretion at high redshifts is by cold flows of material coming into the halo along with the dark matter halos . in the case of @xmath47 halos at high z",
    "these cold accretion flows reach the host halo along cosmic filaments and go straight down to the centre of the halo , where they can feed the main galaxy on a dynamical time . by the time the cold accretion flows reach the main galaxy they will have acquired a substantial amount of kinetic energy that will have to be dispersed .",
    "some if it will be radiated away and some of it will go into rotational energy of the newly arrived material .",
    "another possible option is that some fraction of this energy is used to drive turbulence in the gaseous disk .",
    "observations show that indeed high - z disks tend to have higher gas velocity dispersions than local disks . using results from numerical simulations on the fraction of cold accreted material as function of halo mass",
    "one finds that only @xmath0 of the accretion energy of cold flows is actually needed to drive turbulence at the level that it is observed over a wide range of galaxy masses and rotational velocities of disks at high - z .",
    "interestingly one can recover the steep correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 by just invoking energy equilibrium between accretion energy and energy dissipation in the disk , and the functional dependence of the fraction of cold accretion as a function of halo mass .",
    "it will be interesting now to see how the fraction of cold accretion will reflect on @xmath43 for massive galaxies at low z.    we here presented a number of model results on galaxy properties at high redshift , that relied on the faster assembly of structure , in particular the accretion of cold gas onto galaxies .",
    "coming observations will reveal further details of the galaxy population at high redshift , that will certainly require more detailed modeling and will allow to test current models ."
