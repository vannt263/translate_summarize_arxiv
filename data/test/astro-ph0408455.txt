    "recent advances in observational cosmology have led to unprecedented constraints on the parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "one of the outstanding goals in the field is to determine the mechanism responsible for the seeds that lead to the the structure in the observable universe .",
    "the current data is consistent with an initial scale invariant and adiabatic spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations which existed outside the horizon at recombination .",
    "these observations are in agreement with the predictions of single field slow - roll inflationary models , but various alternatives scenarios still remain viable .    in the next decade",
    "we will see further advances in observations that will constrain many aspects of the primordial seeds .",
    "the spectral index of their power spectrum will be measured more accurately and over a wider range of scales by a combination of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and other large scale structure ( lss ) probes .",
    "dedicated cmb polarization instruments will establish whether or not there is a stochastic background of gravitational waves as predicted by models where inflation happens at the gut scale .",
    "the constraints on gaussianity , which are the focus of this paper , will also improve significantly .",
    "the gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations has received a lot of attention lately mainly because in standard single - field slow - roll inflation models the deviations from gaussianity of the perturbations can be fully calculated and are directly related to the departures from scale invariance and thus predicted to be very small @xcite , most probably unobservable in the cmb . thus constraints on the gaussianity can help distinguish simple inflation models from the various alternatives .",
    "most of the alternatives to single - field slow - roll inflation solve the standard cosmological problems in the same way , by invoking a period of accelerated expansion in the very early universe ( see @xcite for a counter example ) .",
    "they differ however in the characteristics of the produced perturbations .",
    "just as in slow - roll models the perturbations arise from quantum fluctuations during inflation but the detailed physics is not the same . in some of the models",
    "the dynamics of the inflaton field is fundamentally changed by the presence of higher derivative terms in the lagrangian which can even lead to an inflaton field that is not rolling slowly @xcite .",
    "another possibility are models in which fluctuations in another field different from the inflaton are responsible for the adiabatic fluctuations we observe today @xcite .",
    "these alternative models usually make distinctive predictions about the shape of the spectrum of primordial perturbations , the amplitude of the gravity wave background and the departures from gaussianity as described , for example , by the 3-point function . for scale",
    "invariant perturbations the three point function in fourier space or bispectrum , is effectively a full function of two variables ,",
    "thus it could contain a wealth of information about the primordial seeds .",
    "the different alternatives to slow - roll inflation not only predict different levels of non - gaussianities but also different shapes for the bispectrum as a function of triangle configuration . moreover one can make a very definite and model independent statement about the shape of the three - point function in the so called collapsed limit .",
    "the collapsed limit corresponds to a three - point function where one of the fourier modes has a much longer wavelength than the other two . in that limit the three - point function",
    "should go to zero , unless more than one degree of freedom is dynamically relevant during inflation @xcite .",
    "other consistency relations can be obtained involving the three - point function and the amplitude and slope of tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "thus a detailed measurement of the three - point function could provide very interesting information on the mechanism responsible for generating the primordial curvature perturbations . in this work",
    "we will use the so called `` local model '' for the non - gaussianities and specify the amplitude of non - gaussianity by the parameter @xmath2 . in this model the gravitational potential , @xmath3 , can be expressed in terms of a gaussian gravitational potential , @xmath4 , as @xmath5.\\ ] ] the bispectrum in this model can be written as @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the power spectrum .",
    "in general the primordial bispectrum can not be written as in eq .",
    "( [ local ] ) and so constraints on the @xmath2 parameter do not automatically apply to all models of primordial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can list approximate values of @xmath2 that are expected in the various alternatives to single field slow - roll inflation in order to estimate the detectability of these various models .",
    "for comparison in slow - roll inflation models one expects an @xmath8 @xcite . in models where higher derivative operators are important for the dynamics of the field one can expect results ranging from @xmath9 in models where high derivative operators are suppressed by a low uv cut - off @xcite to @xmath10 in models based on the dirac - born - infeld effective action .",
    "a recent idea called ghost inflation , where inflation occurs in a background that has a constant rate of change instead of a constant background value , can also give @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the effect of additional light fields on the efficiency of reheating can lead to inhomogeneities in the thermalized species @xcite ; this mechanism was shown to produce an @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another example is the curvaton model where isocurvature fluctuations in a second light scalar field during inflation generate adiabatic fluctuations after the inflationary epoch is completed , these can cause large non - gaussianity , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there are two additional sources of non - gaussianity that although not primordial in origin could be observed first by future experiments .",
    "the first and perhaps the most important for observations is secondary anisotropies such as gravitational lensing , the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects and the effects of a patchy reionization .",
    "the second source are non - gaussianities related to the non - linear nature of general relativity .",
    "the expectation is that this latter source will lead to @xmath14 ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , although there is no full calculation of the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cmb to second order in the the curvature perturbations . in @xcite results",
    "were presented for the collapsed limit , where the calculation simplifies enormously .",
    "it that case @xmath15 was obtained although the shape dependance of the bispectrum was different from that of the @xmath2 model .",
    "while some of the afforementioned models of the early universe are speculative , the second order single field , slow - roll inflation and non - linear radiative transfer calculations should be taken as definite predictions of standard cosmology .",
    "it is interesting to determine how close we are to observing any of these effects .",
    "currently the best constraints , which come from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , imply @xmath16 ( @xmath17 c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "the theoretical ability of cmb temperature maps to constrain @xmath2 has been determined for a cobe normalized einstein - de sitter ( eds ) model @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the minimum @xmath2 detectable by wmap is 20 , planck is 5 and an ideal experiment ( no noise and infinitesimal beam width ) is 3 .",
    "the limiting factor in the case of an ideal experiment was taken to be the effect of gravitational lensing , which increases the estimator noise without affecting the cmb bispectrum signal .",
    "gravitational lensing adds to the cosmic variance portion of the noise because the particular realization of the large scale structure that lenses the cmb is also _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "other secondary sources of anisotropies will have a similar effect .    since it appears that we are close to being able to detect some of the interesting non - gaussian effects mentioned above , it is important to explore other sources of information beyond the cmb temperature fluctuations to see if the minimum detectable value is lowered when the new information is included .",
    "the cmb is linearly polarized and the @xmath18 type polarization is sensitive to the primordial curvature fluctuations .",
    "therefore in this paper we will ask how much stronger would the constraints on @xmath2 be if information from the @xmath18 polarization is included . since @xmath19 polarization can not be directly generated by the scalar primordial curvature fluctuations we will ignore it in this paper .    as we mentioned above , there are two ways in which secondary anisotropies can complicate and degrade our ability to constrain primordial non - gaussianity . if the source of secondary anisotropies being considered produces a three - point function it might bias the estimator of primordial non - gaussianity . in practice , a model of primordial non - gaussianity is assumed and a reduced bispectrum template is calculated .",
    "the distinct shape of the primordial reduced bispectrum may allow it to be distinguished from the other bispectra @xcite , assuming it can be detected with a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio . in addition secondaries add fluctuations which increase the variance estimators of the three - point function without contributing to the signal .",
    "in fact the variance of the estimator is related to the six - point function of the temperature field .",
    "the six - point function can be expressed in terms of its unconnected gaussian contribution : permutations of three two - point functions , the product of a two and a connected four - point functions and a connected six - point function .",
    "previous work on this subject has ignored any non - gaussian contribution to the six - point function .",
    "the secondary anisotropy that will be considered in detail is gravitational lensing .",
    "gravitational lensing does not produces a three - point function , so it will not bias our estimator of the primordial bispectrum",
    ". however it will produce corrections to the two - point function and create four and six - point functions even if the cmb anisotropies are perfectly gaussian @xcite .",
    "also , lensing will create small scale power in the cmb two - point function which acts like noise in the analysis of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "all information about @xmath2 is eliminated on scales where this effect dominates ; this limits the minimum @xmath2 that an ideal experiment can detect to be @xmath20 for the eds model @xcite .",
    "fortunately the graviational lensing effect in a eds cosmology is much larger than the gravitational lensing effect in a @xmath21 concordance cosmology @xcite , so gravitational lensing will be less important in our calculations . for reference the lensed and unlensed cmb power spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ cl ] . lensing increases the power in the temperature ( polarization ) anisotropies by a factor of two at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "however we will find that the four - point function starts reducing the signal to noise of the bispectrum on significantly larger scales .    in this work",
    "we will ignore other secondary anisotropies such as the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects and the ostriker - vishniac effect .",
    "the dominant secondary anisotropy , the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect , has a characteristic spectral shape that will allow it to be separated . in general the physics of these secondary anisotropies",
    "requires a non - linear analysis using hydrodynamical simulations , we will leave a detailed analysis of the effects of these secondary anisotropies to a future work @xcite .",
    "these secondary anisotropies also produce polarization in the cmb , fortunately the amplitude of the polarization secondary anisotropies is much lower than the corresponding temperature anisotropies and will be less of a problem .    finally ,",
    "although the @xmath18 and @xmath19 polarization modes most directly correspond to the primordial curvature fluctuations and gravity waves , they are not directly measured in cmb experiments .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are measured and then decomposed into @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "while this decomposition is perfectly well defined for a noise free experiment observing the full sky , ambiguities arises in practical experimental situations @xcite .",
    "fortunately the majority of the information on @xmath2 comes from small scales , where this ambiguity is less of a problem if we assume the beam is oversampled in order to reduce the effects of power aliasing that can also mix @xmath18 and @xmath19 modes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will ignore these complications in the decomposition of the stokes parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we derive the optimal estimator when polarization information is included in the non - gaussianity measurements , provide numerical results for the improved constraints on @xmath2 and quantify the reduction in the @xmath26 due to the connected four - point function contribution to the noise . in section iii",
    "we analytically reproduce our calculations for toy models that do not include the effect of radiative transfer or the curvature of the sky , but develop intuition about our numerical results .",
    "we will conclude in section iv with a discussion of our results . in this paper",
    "we assume the standard @xmath21 cosmology with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 km @xmath32 mpc@xmath33 with a scale invariant primordial power spectrum and normalized to the 1-yr wmap data @xcite .",
    "also we do not include the effects of reionization nor the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
