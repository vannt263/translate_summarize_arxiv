    "these processes are prominent at @xmath0 , coincident with the assembly of stellar mass in galaxies and may play a stronger role in the shallow potential wells that host low mass galaxies . in general , the formation and development of a galaxy depends strongly on its mass .",
    "massive galaxies tend to assemble their stellar mass first (  downsizing \" , e.g. , @xcite ) and develop disks earlier ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , low mass ( @xmath8 ) galaxies tend to exhibit more disturbed and irregular morphologies at both low and high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating that they lack mature structure .",
    "recent evidence from imaging suggests that a significant fraction of low mass galaxies at @xmath91.5 appear to have elongated stellar distributions @xcite .",

    "the star - forming gas in these simulated galaxies starts off in a highly perturbed and triaxial state , eventually collapsing to form thick oblate disks @xcite .",
    "from @xmath11 to now , star - forming systems appear to have evolved through kinematic downsizing in a process known as  disk settling \" @xcite . in this picture , galaxies hierarchically settle from turbulent systems with high dispersion to regularly rotating disks , with more massive galaxies forming disks earlier . locally : the majority of high mass galaxies are ordered rotating disks , with kinematically disordered galaxies appearing only below a stellar mass of @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 9.5 @xcite .",

    "we make size selections using the emission rather than the continuum for a couple of reasons .",

    "secondly , seeing tends to blur emission that is not coincident with the slit placement into the slit @xcite . as such",
    ", an emission size determined from a projection of the slit onto the hst image may underestimate the extent of the emission measured with the slit . by measuring sizes directly from the seeing - corrected emission lines , we bypass both of these uncertainties .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cont_size_em_size ] we show the half - light diameter sizes , in both emission and continuum , for the galaxies in our sample . for each slit",
    ", the emission line size is measured directly from the spectrally - collapsed emission line . due to the convolution of the intrinsic profile with the seeing",
    ", the spatial profiles of the spectrally - collapsed emission lines are generally well described by a 1d gaussian .",
    "the seeing is subtracted from the observed profile in quadrature ( @xmath48 ) and the half - light size is measured from the recovered intrinsic profile .",
    "continuum radii are measured from the hst / wfc3 h - band image using the galfit software package in @xcite .",
    "for the galaxies in our sample , the half - light radii of the intrinsic emission profiles tend to be slightly larger than the continuum sizes . this could be the case for two reasons .",
    "first , the half - light radius that is measured by galfit is a 2d quantity measured on concentric ellipses while the emission size is being measured directly from the 1d emission lines , an along - the - slit measurement .",
    "since the 1d measurement essentially integrates the light across the slit , these two sizes will not directly scale to one another in general .",
    "the difference may also be physical , in the sense that the emission profile can extend beyond that of the continuum ( @xcite ) .",
    "kinematics are measured from strong nebular emission lines ( h@xmath29 , @xmath305007 ] ) in the spectra .",
    "these lines generally trace the hot ( t@xmath3610@xmath49 k ) ionized gas in hii regions surrounding ongoing star - formation .",
    "the kinematics are measured using the code rotcurve @xcite .",
    "the instrumental resolution of our spectra ( r@xmath363630 ) allow us to measure the velocity dispersion down to @xmath4120 km s@xmath26 and the rotation velocity uncorrected for inclination ( @xmath50 ) to @xmath4115 km s@xmath26 .",
    "the kinematic modeling performed by rotcurve has been described in detail in previous papers , so we will briefly outline it here and refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "rotcurve models the spatial profile of the emission line as a 1d gaussian . in each row along the slit",
    ", we recover a velocity and velocity dispersion using an uncertainty - weighted least squares fit to a 1d gaussian .",
    "nearby , but not overlapping , skylines are manually masked to prevent noise peaks from driving the fit .",
    "the velocity structure of the line is modeled with two components : a rotation curve and a dispersion term . due to our limited spatial resolution , the velocity dispersion is kept constant with radius in the model .",
    "the rotation velocity is modeled with an arctan function :    @xmath51    where r@xmath52 is the knee radius for the turnover of the rotation curve and @xmath53 is the velocity of the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "we note that the flat part of the rotation curve is not reached in a fraction of our galaxy sample ( see appendix ) and in these cases @xmath53 is driven by the scale of the velocity difference reached by the data and the modeled turnover radius . due to the seeing blur ,",
    "r@xmath52 is not well constrained and so we fix the turnover radius in the model at a fiducial value of 0.2@xmath35 ( 1.7 kpc at @xmath0 ) and adjust to 0.3@xmath35 or 0.4@xmath35 for galaxies that are not well fit initially .",
    "the turnover radius and the rotation velocity are moderately covariant with a @xmath540.1change in r@xmath52 resulting in a @xmath540.1 dex change in @xmath53 .",
    "the model parameters of @xmath53 and @xmath2 are explored on a grid of 5 km s@xmath26 .",
    "the modeled emission line is then spatially convolved with a fixed seeing kernel ( 0.6 fwhm ) , which is the typical seeing of our observations in the nir .",
    "the best fit model is determined through a @xmath55 minimization with the data over this grid .",
    "the velocity dispersion term that we measure ( @xmath2 ) is unlike a pressure supported stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the hot gas which @xmath2 is tracing can collisionally radiate and so a high dispersion system can not remain in equilibrium after a crossing time . due to the seeing blur , the velocity dispersion is a measure of the small scale velocity gradients below the seeing limit .",
    "the velocity dispersion measured from nebular emission lines will be a combination of : ( . )",
    "thermal broadening of the gas ( @xmath2410 km s@xmath26 for h at 10@xmath56 k ) , ( . ) internal turbulence in hii regions ( @xmath24 20 km s@xmath26 for local hii regions ; ) , ( . ) relative motions between hii regions .",
    "the inclination is measured as @xmath57 , where @xmath29 is the correction for the thickness of the disk ( @xmath29 = 0.2 ) and b / a is the axis ratio of the galaxy , measured from the hst h - band image . the rotation velocity is then corrected as @xmath58 .    as indicated by @xcite ,",
    "distinguishing late - stage mergers and rotating disks is difficult in low resolution kinematics observations . at high redshift , where galaxy mergers are expected to be common @xcite , disk classifications made from kinematic signatures alone may be biased high . in 2 galaxies in our sample ( i d : 21897 and 4476 ) we identify an interacting neighbor in both the hst image ( @xmath59 ) and the mosfire spectrum ( @xmath60 km s@xmath26 ) .",
    "we mask the emission line of the neighboring source in both of these cases .",
    "we note that late - stage interactions , for which two galaxies are identified as a single source , may be included in this sample .",
    "a joint analysis of the hst imaging and the kinematic data is necessary to disentangle disks from late - stage mergers in our sample .",
    "for all subsequent analyses , we interpret the measured velocity gradient of each galaxy as rotation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : kin_example ] , we show example kinematic fits for three galaxies in our sample : a strongly rotating galaxy , a galaxy with comparable velocity and velocity dispersion , and a dispersion dominated galaxy . even in the dispersion dominated case , we note the presence of a velocity gradient , although it is small compared to the observed dispersion .",
    "the rotationally supported system is a well - ordered disk galaxy , similar to disk galaxies today , with the presence of spiral structure and a bar in the hst image . in its spectrum , we find a strong rotation signature ( @xmath24 175 km s@xmath26 ) and a mild velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 35 km s@xmath26 ) .    beam smearing tends to blur together spatially separate regions of emission , leading to a flattening of nearby velocity gradients and an elevation in the local velocity dispersion . in the observed line , this effect leads to a classic peak in the velocity dispersion at the center of the galaxy , where the velocity gradient is the steepest .",
    "this can be seen in the example kinematic fits in figure [ fig : kin_example ] , particularly for the strongly rotating galaxy .",
    "rotcurve models the seeing and accounts for this artificial beam smearing when constructing its model .",
    "the best - fit kinematic parameters of the full sample are presented in table [ tab : table2 ] of the appendix .",
    "single - slit spectroscopy is a reliable method for recovering rotation velocity and velocity dispersion in observations where the position angle of the slit is aligned with the kinematic major axis of the galaxy .",
    "in ordered disk galaxies , the kinematic and photometric major axes are aligned and so the hst / wfc3 image can be used to determine the kinematic major axis .",
    "however , the morphologies of high redshift star - forming galaxies can be more severely disturbed than local or low redshift samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) , implying that the photometric and kinematic major axes might be misaligned . in a sample that combines galaxies at both @xmath61 and @xmath0 , @xcite report that kinematic and photometric axes are at least moderately misaligned ( @xmath62 ) in @xmath2440@xmath63 of galaxies and are largely misaligned ( @xmath64 ) in @xmath2420@xmath63 .",
    "this fraction declines to @xmath65 in local galaxies .    for seeing - limited observations of high redshift galaxies ,",
    "slit placement is much less stringent than for local galaxies or for higher resolution observations . to recover rotation ,",
    "the alignment between the slit and the kinematic major axis should be within 45@xmath31 ( see figure 13 of @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 26 galaxies in sigma have observations at multiple position angles ( @xmath66 , see figure [ fig : vel_map_combined ] ) . due to the non - uniform coverage of our maps , we do not simultaneously model all of the observed slits on a galaxy .",
    "instead we examine the kinematic measurements along each slit separately and adopt measurements for the slit with the highest rotational signature .",
    "we require that every galaxy in sigma have at least one slit that is aligned within 45@xmath31 of the photometric major axis ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this requirement ensures that rotation will be recovered in disk galaxies , where the photometric and kinematic axes are aligned .",

    "these galaxies are marked in all of the figures .",
    "as shown in an example in figure [ fig : vel_map_combined ] , these systems tend to have complex velocity profiles . in some of these cases ,",
    "velocity shear is found in the aligned slit as well , implying that the velocity gradient ( either tracing global rotation or more complex motions ) may lie between both slits .",
    "the tully - fisher relation ( tf ; ) is an empirical scaling relating the dynamics and the luminosity , or more recently , stellar mass of galaxies . in the local universe ,",
    "the relation is relatively tight for massive disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) but begins to show small residuals to low mass for gas - rich galaxies @xcite and large residuals to low rotation velocity for irregular low mass galaxies ( @xmath70)@xcite .",

    "recent lensing work at high redshift has also found evidence for scatter to low rotation velocity from the tf relation for a handful of low mass galaxies @xcite .",

    "in this appendix , we perform mock observations of simulated sigma spectra in order to determine the limiting spatial scale from which we can recover rotation velocity , if present , in our observations .",
    "we find that we can recover kinematics down to a limit of d@xmath44/seeing@xmath46 = 0.8 . in  2 , we apply this limit to our data set .",
    "the spectra presented in this paper were observed in seeing limited conditions , and as such the effects of beam smearing @xcite are important to understand . seeing tends to blur together spatially distinct velocities , leading to a decreased rotation signature and an elevated velocity dispersion . to explore the effective resolution set by beam smearing in sigma",
    ", we create a set of model spectra with various sizes and fixed kinematic parameters .",
    "as described below , we perform mock observations of the kinematics for these spectra and explore how the results vary with size .",
    "our model for a single mock sigma / mosfire spectrum consists of first creating a 1d emission line with a sersic intensity profile :      where r@xmath120 is the half - light radius , @xmath166 is the intensity at the half - light radius , @xmath167 is the sersic index and @xmath168 is a numerical constant that depends on @xmath167 ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "we set @xmath170 , characteristic of the emission line intensity profile for galaxies at this redshift @xcite .",
    "we then draw from an appropriate error spectrum to set the central signal - to - noise per pixel to 15 , typical of sigma spectra .",
    "the final integrated s / n of these simulated spectra are well - matched to our sample .",
    "next , we apply an arctan velocity profile ( see eq 1 ) and a constant velocity dispersion to the emission line .",
    "we fix the rotation velocity to 100 km s@xmath26 and the velocity dispersion to 50 km s@xmath26 , characteristic of @xmath0 disk galaxies .",
    "we then apply a seeing kernel of 0.7 \" in the spatial direction and mosfire instrumental broadening ( @xmath171 = 40 km s@xmath26 ) in the spectral direction . following the seeing convolution ,",
    "the emission profile is well described by a gaussian ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "we repeat this process 100 times , redrawing from the error spectrum each time to create independent realizations with the same fixed parameters .",
    "we then vary the effective radius of the emission line from 0.1 - 0.7 @xmath35 in 30 even steps of 0.02@xmath35/step . at each step",
    "we again simulate 100 realizations with the same fixed properties .",
    "the final dataset contains 3000 simulated sigma spectra .    to measure the kinematics from the mock spectra , we run the same fitting technique used for our observations ( rotcurve )",
    "for each spatial scale modeled , we measure 100 values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and examine their mean and variance .",
    "the results of this study are shown in figure [ fig : model_size ] .",
    "the rotation velocity is well recovered with an intrinsic error of @xmath24 15 km s@xmath26 . for simulated spectra with",
    "effective diameter at or greater than the seeing , we accurately recover the input rotation and dispersion . below a value of d@xmath44/seeing@xmath46",
    "= 0.8 , the limiting spatial resolution drastically affects the recovered values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is both a larger uncertainty in the measurements and a systematic decline in the measured rotation velocity .",
    "based on the results of these models , we determine that the spatial scale for recovering kinematics in our observations is diameter d@xmath44 @xmath28 0.8 @xmath45 seeing@xmath46 . above this value",
    "we can reliably recover rotational motion , if present .",
