    "identical particle correlations ( hbt ) have been used to study the space - time characteristics of the in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "non - identical particle correlations give new insights into collision s dynamics  @xcite .",
    "such correlations arise from coulomb ( for charged particles ) and strong ( for hadrons ) interactions , which occur after particles last elastic collision .",
    "we show correlation functions for particle pairs with small relative momentum @xmath3 , which means close velocities in the source rest frame .",
    "the height and width of the correlation effect carry the information about the size of the emission region .",
    "the correlation functions of non - identical particles also carry a qualitatively new piece of information - the emission asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "the technique uses the fact that both particles are identifiable .",
    "we divide particle pairs in two groups - with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the component of the relative momentum of the first particle in one of the following directions : @xmath7 - the direction of pair momentum , @xmath8 - the direction of beam axis or @xmath9 - perpendicular to both previous ones .",
    "we can then construct two correlation functions : @xmath10 for pairs with @xmath4 , and @xmath11 for pairs with @xmath5 .",
    "it can be shown that these two functions should be identical if the average emission points of the two particle species are the same .",
    "however if there is a non - zero difference @xmath12 between average emission points @xmath13 of both particle species in the given direction @xmath14 , the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be different , and their difference , visible in the `` double ratio '' @xmath17 will be directly related to this @xmath12 .    by symmetry considerations",
    "it can be shown , that @xmath18 . for a symmetric system with a symmetric rapidity coverage ( as is the case in auau collisions at star ) we also have @xmath19 .",
    "the only direction where we expect the asymmetry is @xmath7 .",
    "it can be written : @xmath20 , where values with asterisk ( @xmath21 ) are in the pair rest frame and therefore can be measured directly through the correlation functions , while values without the asterisk are in the source rest frame . from equation ( [ rousdep ] )",
    "one can see that the observable asymmetry can come from space and/or time component .",
    "the non - identical particle ( pion - kaon ) correlations have been studied by the star experiment  @xcite . in a continuation of this analysis",
    "we have used pions , kaons and protons identified in the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) detector  @xcite .",
    "central auau collisions at @xmath0 and @xmath22 were studied .",
    "particles with rapidity ( @xmath23 ) were used .",
    "the momentum ranges ( in @xmath24 ) were : ( 0.08 , 0.5 ) for pions , ( 0.3,1.0 ) for kaons and ( 0.3,1.2 ) for protons .",
    "all functions were corrected for particle purity , momentum resolution and two - track detector effects ( hit - sharing ) - for detailed description we refer the reader to  @xcite .    we have measured correlations with strange baryons - @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they were identified using a topological reconstruction of their decay into @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "particle purity has been estimated accounting for resonance feed - down and the signal to noise under the invariant mass peak .",
    "the momentum range for @xmath25 s was @xmath29 @xmath30 .    in fig .",
    "[ cffig ] we present the preliminary correlation functions for all combinations of pion - kaon , pion - proton kaon - proton pairs .",
    "the correlation functions for all like - sign and opposite - sign combinations agree , which suggests that the emission mechanisms for opposite charge pions , kaons and protons are the same .",
    "it is important to note that opposite - charge kaon - proton correlation function clearly deviates from the theoretical expectation , which suggests that our knowledge of this interaction is incomplete .",
    "we obtain the `` double '' ratios in the @xmath7 direction by dividing the right side ( @xmath31 ) of the plots in fig .",
    "[ cffig ] by the left(@xmath32 ) .",
    "they clearly deviate from unity for all the pair combinations , showing that pions , kaons and protons are not emitted from the same average space - time point .    to quantify that shift a fitting procedure",
    "is applied to the data .",
    "a source is assumed to be a 3-dimensional gaussian in the pair rest frame with a width @xmath33 and a shift @xmath34 in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "they are taken as parameters of the fit .",
    "for each of their values , with the use of the experimental momentum distribution , a theoretical correlation function is constructed .",
    "we use a @xmath35 test to measure how well the generated correlation function agrees with the experimental one .",
    "the one with the lowest @xmath35 value is taken as the `` best fit '' .",
    "the results of this fitting procedure are shown on fig .",
    "[ modelfit ] .",
    "heavy - ion reaction models , which study the dynamics of the collision , provide a description of the emitting source .",
    "they also give the predictions for the emission asymmetries , which can be directly compared to our experimental results and used to gain a better understanding of the reaction .",
    "the blast - wave parameterization  @xcite inspired by hydrodynamic calculations provides a simple way of describing a system with strong transverse radial flow .",
    "the asymmetry comes from the interplay between a flow velocity and thermal smearing of the emission point .",
    "this model shows that radial flow does produce the emission asymmetry that we expect .",
    "moreover , the blast - wave calculation  @xcite done with the parameters fixed by other measurements ( elliptic flow - @xmath36  @xcite , @xmath37 hbt  @xcite , single particle spectra  @xcite ) predict an asymmetry which is consistent with the data  @xcite .",
    "we also studied the predictions of the rqmd model  @xcite , which produces radial flow through hadronic rescatterings .",
    "in addition it allows for a complete treatment of resonances . their decay can be a source of delayed ( relative to the direct production ) emission of pions , kaons and protons . since the average delays are different for different particle species , we see a resulting average time shift between pions , kaons and protons , which produces emission asymmetries which sum with the spatial asymmetry coming from flow ( see eq .",
    "( [ rousdep ] ) ) .",
    "the relative weight of both components is shown on fig .",
    "[ modelfit ] .",
    "experimentally , it is impossible to disentangle space and time contributions to the asymmetry .",
    "however the study of rescattering models shows , that neither flow , nor time difference alone are able to explain the magnitude of asymmetries observed in the data .",
    "this suggests that both are necessary to explain our measurements .",
    "the @xmath38 correlation function from star  @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "[ placf ] .",
    "it has been studied using the analytical model from lednick and lyuboshitz  @xcite .",
    "if we assume a gaussian source , and use the interaction parameters from  @xcite , we obtain a source size @xmath39 .",
    "an intercept parameter @xmath40 was fixed at @xmath41 , which is consistent with estimated pair purity . in fig .",
    "[ placf ] we also show , measured for the first time , @xmath42 correlation function . for this system",
    "the phase shifts are not known .",
    "the same model as for @xmath38 has been applied , but this time with phase shifts as free parameters .",
    "the radius @xmath43 was obtained , as well as a non - zero imaginary part of the scattering amplitude , which suggests significant annihilation in the system .    in fig .",
    "[ placf ] we present the preliminary @xmath44 correlation function from star .",
    "it has a shape expected for a coulomb - dominated interaction .",
    "the @xmath45 resonance is observed at @xmath46 .",
    "the calculation shown was performed using pratt s @xmath44 interaction calculation code , with the assumption that the @xmath26 flows significantly . in the future",
    "this function may provide new insights into the question of how does the @xmath26 flow compared to pions .",
    "we have presented the preliminary results of pion - kaon , pion - proton and kaon - proton correlations measurements by the star experiment .",
    "the emission asymmetries between all types of particles have been measured .",
    "they are shown to be consistent with transverse radial flow produced in heavy - ion collisions , as seen e.g in the blast - wave parameterization .",
    "rescattering models were used to study the effect of emission time differences , which were found to be important , but not sufficient to explain the observed asymmetry .",
    "therefore our measurements provide an independent confirmation of the existence transverse radial flow in auau collisions at rhic .",
    "the @xmath44 correlations are also supporting this picture ; such measurement may provide , in future , important information on collective behavior of @xmath26 .    correlations with strange baryons ( as well as opposite - charge kaon - proton correlations )",
    "have been used to study the unknown interaction potentials , the information which is sometimes inaccessible in any other way ( e.g. @xmath47 correlations ) .",
    "they have also been used to obtain source sizes at high @xmath48 .",
