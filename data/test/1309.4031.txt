    "cobalt ferrite , cofe@xmath0o@xmath1 ( cfo ) , with the inverse spinel structure is well known to have a relatively large magnetic anisotropy , high curie temperature of around @xmath7 , moderate saturation magnetization , remarkable chemical stability , and good mechanical hardness .",
    "these excellent properties offer cfo numerous technological applications in areas such as hard pinning layers , pressure sensors , actuators , and transducers , spin filters , and drug delivery.@xcite recently , much attention has been focused on the growth of epitaxial spinel ferrite thin films on piezoelectric substrates - a type of magnetoelectric multiferroic composite structure proposed to overcome the limited choice of single - phase multiferroic materials exhibiting coexistence of strongly coupled ferro / ferrimagnetism and ferroelectricity .",
    "@xcite the coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic phases in such multiferroic heterostructures produces novel properties resulting from the interfacial coupling of structural , electrical , and magnetic order parameters .",
    "because of its large magnetostrictive coefficient , cfo has been considered as an important component for multiferroic composites that exhibit a strong coupling of the order parameters through the heteroepitaxy of the two lattices .",
    "@xcite in order to couple via the interface , epitaxial growth of cfo with chemically sharp , smooth interfaces , as well as good magnetic properties , is critical . up to date",
    ", epitaxial cfo films have been successfully fabricated by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) ,  @xcite molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) ,  @xcite and metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) .",
    "@xcite these cfo films have been grown primarily on single crystal substrates such as perovskite srtio@xmath8 ( sto ) , isostructural spinel mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 ( mao ) , rocksalt mgo , and various buffered substrates .",
    "the thickness of these films is usually in the range of several nanometers up to @xmath9 , but their magnetic properties are usually far from bulk properties and also the quality of film microstructure decreases with increasing thickness .",
    "3d island formation at high growth temperature , large lattice mismatch and the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between the film and substrates have been considered as the major obstacles to achieve high quality cfo thin films .",
    "@xcite thus , it remains a challenge for developing efficient synthetic techniques to fabricate epitaxial thick cfo films with near - perfect microstructure and excellent magnetic properties close to bulk cfo .",
    "direct liquid injection chemical vapor deposition ( dli - cvd ) is an attractive method for the fabrication of multi - component stoichiometric films because of its accurate delivery of several precursors dissolved in a common solvent .",
    "@xcite this deposition method also has the advantages of relatively low cost , high deposition rates , industrial compatibility , and the flexibility to fabricate multilayer structures over conventional thin film processes .",
    "dli - cvd has already been utilized to prepare atomically smooth nife@xmath0o@xmath1 ( nfo ) thin films at temperatures of @xmath10 with saturation magnetization values only slightly lower than bulk nife@xmath0o@xmath1 .  @xcite",
    "as cfo possesses a similar spinel ferrite structure like nife@xmath0o@xmath1 , dli - cvd should also potentially enable the growth of high quality cfo thin films with bulk - like properties . in this work",
    ", we present the results of our growth studies and the structural and magnetic properties of high - quality thick cfo films ( @xmath11 ) epitaxially grown on ( 100)-oriented mao substrates by dli - cvd method .",
    "a narrow growth temperature window is found for the growth of high quality cfo thin film .",
    "last but not least , we show that the optimized deposition parameters are suitable for the growth of thick cfo films on a variety of other substrates [ ( mgo , lead magnesium niobate - lead titanate ( pmn - pt ) , and lead zinc niobate - lead titanate ( pzn - pt ) ] with excellent structural quality .",
    "the dli - cvd setup used for the experiments has already been described in a previous report .",
    "@xcite in our growth process , anhydrous co(acac)@xmath8 and fe(acac)@xmath8 ( acac is an abbreviation for acetylacetonate ) in the molar ratio of 1:2 were dissolved in n , n - dimethyl formamide ( dmf ) to form a clear homogeneous precursor solution .",
    "the precursor solution was then introduced into a brooks instrument dli 200 vaporizer system , vaporized by heated ar gas , followed by reaction with oxygen ( o@xmath0 ) gas on heated substrates placed in a cvd reactor , resulting in the formation of a stoichiometric cfo film on the substrate .",
    "the flow rates of ar and o@xmath0 gas were optimized to be 400 and 150 sccm , respectively , with a precursor injection rate of @xmath12 .",
    "the film deposition was carried out at temperatures ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath14 for 1 h. after deposition , the films were cooled to room temperature in the reactor under flowing o@xmath0 .",
    "film morphology was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy ( fe - sem , jeol-7000 ) as well as atomic force microscopy ( afm , veeco nanoscope - iv ) . to determine the crystal phase and epitaxy of the resulting films , a standard 4 circle x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) setup ( phillips x pert pro )",
    "was used with a cu @xmath15 source .",
    "magnetic properties of the cfo films were determined via superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometry ( mpms by quantum design ) at temperatures @xmath16 and in magnetic fields of up to @xmath17 .",
    "polarized raman spectra were measured with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 scattering configurations using a @xmath22 excitation source at room temperature . in these notations",

    "the narrow rocking curve with a fwhm of @xmath36 is indicative of the high structural quality .",

    "the cfo grown at @xmath13 exhibits no film reflections and thus is amorphous , which is probably due to the low deposition temperature , which leads to a low crystallization rate of the film on the substrate .",
    "cfo films grown between 600 and @xmath32 exhibit a single - phase spinel structure , without any additional peaks from impurity phases .",
    "the characteristic ( 400 ) reflection of the cfo films become narrower and sharper as the deposition temperature increases , indicating that the epitaxy and microstructure improves steadily .",

    "[ figure : xrd_mao](a ) ] indicates a highly epitaxial growth for this deposition temperature . for higher growth temperatures the quality of the films starts to degrade , as evident from the disappearance of the sharp @xmath15 peak splitting for a film grown at @xmath14 .",
    "the film grown at @xmath14 shows a very rough cracked surface with some large area film peeling .",
    "the rough surface can be caused by a faster deposition rate at higher temperature causing a higher density of defects .",
    "these films can easily peel off from the substrate surface during the cooling process due to stress caused by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of film and substrate .",
    "therefore , spinel cfo films with good epitaxy and texture can only be prepared within a narrow growth temperature window around @xmath32 in our dli - cvd setup .",
    "the thickness of the films can be directly controlled by the deposition time .    from the xrd results in fig .",

    "although all the cfo films are rather thick ( @xmath40 ) , the lattice constants of these samples are smaller than the bulk value ( @xmath41 ) , suggesting an in - plane tensile stress in the films . as the lattice constant of mao ( @xmath42 ) is smaller , the occurrence of an in - plane tensile stress is unexpected .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the unexpected in - plane tensile stress in cfo / srruo@xmath8 heterostructure is strongly correlated with the density of the interface misfit dislocations , which are formed at the deposition temperature to relieve the stress caused by the lattice mismatch .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a stress model for heteroepitaxial magnetic oxide films based on the different thermal expansion rates between the substrate and the film during the cooling process .",
    "the residual stress after cooling the sample to room temperature is proportional to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the film and substrate and is not related to the bulk lattice parameters .",
    "a tensile stress on cfo can be created because cfo ( @xmath43 )  @xcite has a larger thermal expansion coefficient than that of mao ( @xmath44 ) ,  @xcite resulting in a faster contraction rate in cfo than in mao when cooling the samples from the deposition temperature to room temperature . from the reduction of the tensile stress in our samples for increasing temperature ,",
    "we conclude that the difference in thermal expansion is not the cause for stress , but more likely the formation of misfit dislocations is dominant .",
