    "directional detection is one of the research frontiers on wimps and several techniques are being studied and developed . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", it has been proposed that large arrays of aligned carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) might be of use for the directional detection of dark matter ( dm ) weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .    as a result of a wimp scattering on the surface of a cnt , a carbon ion , with energy up to few tens kev ,",
    "might be extracted and propagate through multiple collisions within the cnt empty volume , provided that its initial velocity is sufficiently aligned with the cnt axis : a sort of _ ion channeling _ phenomenon . however , in a large aligned cnt array , the ion might be equally channeled by the interstices among different nanotubes , as mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the dynamics in these regions and , by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , to provide an evaluation of the efficiency of a large number of cnt arrays as the target of a directional dm detector carbon nanotubes each , are the building blocks of our detector .",
    "a large number of them must be packed , to obtain a detector surface of the order of 100 m@xmath1 . ] .    at first , we consider particles satisfying channeling conditions .",
    "a continuum repelling potential , from the collective structure of atoms on the cnt surface , can be used to describe the channeling kinematics  @xcite . for nanotube radii much larger than the typical c electron orbital size",
    ", the potential can be well approximated by a step barrier . in this approximation , cnts are considered as full solid cylinders , totally reflecting those ions having the right initial conditions , namely a transverse energy lower than the continuum potential barrier ( * ? ? ?",
    "the ion motion in the transverse plane is that of a particle bouncing in a 2d lattice of circular obstacles .",
    "longitudinal energy and velocity along cnts axes are conserved .",
    "ions are assumed to move freely between consecutive reflections and their trajectories are a combination of broken lines  @xcite . given these initial assumptions , we can validate our monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on known results on classical billiards  @xcite .    in a second step ,",
    "the initial conditions of the extracted ions are computed from the recoiling ion momentum distribution @xcite . when channeling conditions are not met , the scattered ion is allowed to penetrate the cnt and it is then subject to larger energy losses @xcite and angular deviation effects @xcite , due to the interactions with atoms at the cnt surfaces .",
    "the results obtained here give more strength to the proposal presented in  @xcite and give important suggestions on how to devise the cnt arrays to maximize the wimp detection .",
    "although we are still in the stage of a conceptual design and theoretical considerations , the outcome of this work is another step towards the testing of the prototype envisaged in  @xcite .",
    "with really small expected rates , the challenge of dark matter detection experiments is to distinguish an unambiguous signal from a large background .",
    "direct detection experiments identify the recoils produced by incident wimps on the detector target nuclei .",
    "the signal is subject to an annual modulation , related to the variation of the earth s relative motion with respect to the dm galactic halo . up to now , only the dama experiment @xcite claimed the detection of an annual modulation with an undeniable statistical significance .",
    "cresst @xcite and cogent @xcite also reported anomalous results , but their consistency with dama ones is a vexed question .    moreover , these results are in conflict with those from cdms @xcite , xenon10 @xcite , zeplin - ii @xcite and zeplin - iii @xcite , which , on the contrary , found no evidence of annual modulation .",
    "directional detection of dark matter was proposed in @xcite , where it was observed that a strong forward - backward asymmetry is expected in the case of an isothermal spherical galactic halo . because of this , directional detection , even if in the case of poor angular resolution , might also provide information on the apparent wimp wind direction .",
    "several experiments , including drift @xcite , newage @xcite , mimac @xcite , dmtpc @xcite and news @xcite , are focused on this goal .",
    "each of them is based on specific detection techniques .",
    "drift , newage , mimac and dmtpc are dm directional detectors using as target materials low pressure gas mixtures .",
    "nuclear recoils are identified by measuring the induced ionization with a time projection chamber ( tpc ) technique .",
    "dmtpc set a @xmath2 cl upper limit on the spin - dependent wimp - proton cross section of @xmath3 cm@xmath1 for 115 gev wimps @xcite , drift s exclusion curve for spin - dependent wimp - proton interactions reaches 1.1 pb at 100 gev @xcite , while mimac s reaches 5400 pb for 150 gev wimps .",
    "news proposes to use nuclear emulsions as both the wimp target and the tracking detector by reconstructing the direction of the recoiled nucleus .",
    "finally , there is also a proposal to use dna or rna , so that the path of the recoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    ", a new type of directional detector was outlined .",
    "it consists of large arrays of cnts which provide the target material for wimp - nuclei collisions and an anisotropic sensitivity to the recoil direction , complemented by a low pressure tpc - based readout technique to detect the emitted nuclei .",
    "given the relatively low mass of the c nuclei , such detector would extend the wimp search to low masses ( @xmath0  gev ) .",
    "as a first approximation , we consider the cnt system to be a regular array of @xmath5 cylindrical obstacles and assume that the particles can not penetrate them .",
    "elastic collisions are also assumed .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let @xmath6 be the height of the cylindrical obstacles , @xmath7 the radius of their circular basis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : primitive - cell ] ) and assume the cylinder axes are parallel to the @xmath8 direction ( the _ longitudinal _ direction ) , in the @xmath9 half - space , their bases being on the @xmath10 plane ( the _ transverse plane _ ) .",
    "we call , respectively , the @xmath10 plane and its parallel plane at @xmath11 the _ bottom _ and the _ top _ ends of the system .",
    "assume that the bottom bases centers of the @xmath12 cylinders form a square regular array on the @xmath10 plane .",
    "let @xmath13 be the distance between the centers of the bases of two neighboring cylinders and @xmath14 the minimal width of the interstices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : primitive - cell ] , left panel ) .",
    "consider a particle entering the lattice through the bottom plane , thus with longitudinal velocity component @xmath15 , and let @xmath16 be the modulus of the projection of the velocity on the transverse plane .",
    "assuming uniformly distributed positions and transverse velocity directions as initial conditions at the bottom end , we estimate the typical time needed by a particle to exit the array from the top end .",
    "the 2d motion of the system is equivalent to the motion of a particle inside an `` infinite - horizon '' periodic billiard table : a billiard in which there are corridors running straightforwardly towards the perimeter .",
    "the average time spent by a particle inside the billiard can be estimated by using the so called machta - zwanzig approximation @xcite , which holds in the limit @xmath17 ( as for the finite - horizon case ) .",
    "we assume therefore that the particle spends in each elementary cell ( see fig . [",
    "fig : primitive - cell ] , right panel ) a random time exponentially distributed with mean @xmath18 and then jumps with equal probability @xmath19 to any of the four neighboring cells ) , see app .",
    "[ taur ] . ] .",
    "hence , we can estimate the typical total time @xmath20 spent by a particle in the billiard by considering a two - dimensional homogeneous random walk on a square of @xmath5 points in @xmath21 .",
    "the walker starts on the square from a uniformly distributed random point .",
    "we then evaluate the mean number of hops @xmath22 performed by the walker to touch the external boundary of the square . the typical time needed by the particle to exit the billiard",
    "is then given by @xmath23 we evaluate @xmath22 numerically by averaging the total number of jumps performed by each particle in an ensemble of @xmath24 particles . by interpolating the results as a function of the side length @xmath25",
    ", we find @xmath26 .",
    "the quadratic dependence on the side length of the square is quite obvious , since the random walk is symmetric , while the precise value of the numerical prefactor is not .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss the algorithm we used in mc simulations for an infinite horizon billiard .",
    "the semi - analytical expression in eq .",
    "( [ e : ele010 ] ) , with @xmath26 , is then compared to mc numerical results .",
    "we consider a square primitive cell with side of length @xmath27 and periodic boundary conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : primitive - cell ] , right panel ) .",
    "the cnt transverse section is a centered circle in the cell .",
    "each cell is labeled with the indices @xmath28 , which define its position in the @xmath5 lattice .",
    "a particle moves in the lattice and propagates through multiple reflections on obstacles .",
    "the starting position of the particle , projected onto the transverse plane , is determined by @xmath29 , the initial @xmath30 coordinates within the cell and the initial @xmath31 direction ; these quantities are randomly extracted from uniform distributions .",
    "we also assume that the particle trajectory starts outside the nanotube .    as a first step , we check if the ion trajectory intersects any obstacle in the cell : 1 )",
    "if it does , we calculate the reflection angle and determine the new ion trajectory ; 2 ) if it does not , we evaluate the ion position at the boundary of the cell , according to its direction .",
    "then , we exploit the periodic boundary conditions to place the particle on the opposite side of the cell , with proper position and transverse velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : primitive - cell ] , right panel ) .",
    "this procedure is repeated until a stop condition is fulfilled , that is either when the ion exits the lattice or it covers a length @xmath32 in the transverse plane .",
    "below , we show the mc results for the mean exit time , @xmath20 , as a function of @xmath25 from a lattice with @xmath33 nm and @xmath34 nm .",
    "when the exit time @xmath20 from the transverse lattice is less than the time it would take to the ion to exit from the top surface of the cnt array , we are losing a signal count in our ideal dm detector .",
    "we evaluate @xmath20 for @xmath35 and we interpolate the results with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a free fit parameter . the same is done for a @xmath38 nm and @xmath34 nm lattice .",

    "in this section , we address the question whether a particle reaches the top end before exiting the lattice through its sides .",
    "we will consider arrays with larger lattice spacings , @xmath51 nm , and @xmath52 nm . these are the experimental values obtained with a scattering electron microscope ( sem ) image analysis of a sample of aligned cnts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt - photo ] ) .     with respect to the electron beam.,width=226 ]",
    "we then calculate the lateral losses through the sides in the case of a regular lattice and in the case of a random system of cnts . in this second case , which is probably a better approximation for a real cnt array ,",
    "the spacing between tubes is not constant .",
    "specifically , we assume a gaussian distribution for the displacements of the cnt center positions around the sites of a regular lattice .",
    "the simulated carbon ion has an initial energy @xmath53 kev and @xmath54 ev and it can either exit the cnt lattice from the top , after covering the cnt length @xmath55 m , or from the lateral walls , i.e. exit from the transverse lattice , before the top is reached . in the latter case , a potential signal dm counting is lost .",
    "we call @xmath56 the fraction of particles leaving from the external perimeter before reaching the top .",
    "we expect a @xmath57 behavior , which can be explained as follows .",
    "if @xmath25 is sufficiently large , we expect that most of the particles , which exit from the sides , originate within a thin frame close to the external perimeter . the number of particles generated with random initial positions and momenta on the transverse lattice scales with @xmath12 , whereas the number of particles generated close to the perimeter scales with @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we expect the @xmath58 scaling .     on a transverse lattice with parameters @xmath52 nm and @xmath51 nm as a function of the lattice size @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath56 stands for the fraction of particles leaving from the external lattice perimeter , before reaching the cnt top .",
    "we provide results for a regular ( squares ) and a random gaussian lattice ( circles ) , with zero mean @xmath59 and @xmath60 nm . the curves , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which fit the regular and random lattice values of @xmath56 , are shown as continuous and dashed lines , respectively.,width=226 ]    the results of our mc simulations for the regular and random lattices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exit - distance - plot ] with two curves superimposed , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which fit the data in the regular and random cases , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to observe that random lattices trap more particles than regular ones because infinite horizons are closed due to the random displacement of the obstacles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : etavsh - plot ] , we show another plot for @xmath56 as a function of the nanotube height , @xmath6 , with @xmath65 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that lateral losses , if @xmath25 is sufficiently large , do not change dramatically as @xmath6 grows .",
    "thus , relying on these results for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath6 , we can conclude that , if we consider a cnt array with @xmath25 of the order of @xmath66 or larger and a realistic value of the height , @xmath67 300 @xmath59 m , the amount of lateral losses can be kept negligibly small .     for a lattice with parameters @xmath52 nm and @xmath51 nm as a function of the cnt height @xmath6 .",

    "the ions whose trajectories exit from the surface with open end nanotubes ( on the opposite side cnts terminations are closed by a substrate as in fig .",

    "[ fig : initial - distr - e ] , [ fig : initial - distr - cos ] ) , the expected lateral losses are of the order of @xmath131 , approximately .    therefore , commercially available cnt arrays , with a lateral side of @xmath132 nanotubes , are substantially unaffected by this problem .",
    "the detector efficiency should also depend on the lattice spacing , @xmath27 , between nanotubes  in a weak way as we found .",
    "because of this , we can consider a small lattice spacing , @xmath133 nm , in order to pack a suitable detector mass , of the order of 1 kg , on a given surface ( 100 m@xmath1 , approximately ) preserving , at the same time , the detection efficiency .    an important outcome of the present study , which meets the expectations of ref .",
    "@xcite , is that a cnt array cooperates to effectively provide the required anisotropic response for the directional detection of wimps .",
    "in fact , the number of top events estimated is much larger than that of bottom events ; the latter corresponds to the number of top events when the cnt brush is reversed with respect to the direction of the wimp wind .",
    "specifically , the ratio between bottom and top events is @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the double cnt brush detector in @xcite could effectively discriminate the wimp signal from the background .",
    "in @xcite the analysis was focused on the calculation of ion channeling within the fundamental constituent of the lattice : a single nanotube .",
    "it was shown that it is difficult to match the right channeling conditions inside a single cnt immediately after a wimp collision .",
    "however the cnt array as a whole  including interstices among nanotubes  can enlarge the acceptance of the detector cooperating at driving the trajectories of not perfectly collimated ions towards the open exit .",
    "indeed , we showed here that those ions which can not be channeled in a single nanotube , but have initial kinematic conditions close to the channeling ones , have further chances to be channeled by the array , including the interstitial space between cnts .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculated fraction of ions channeled in the nanotubes , immediately after a wimp scattering event , is @xmath135 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig . 7 ) . the remaining large majority , which is the subject of the present study , consists of those particles scattered outside the single nanotube and/or not satisfying the very strict channeling conditions within a single cnt .",
    "the amount of these latter particles , which might be anyway guided by the system of nanotubes towards the top end , can be extracted from table [ tab : final - results ] .",
    "therefore , by combining the previous results of ref . @xcite and those of the present paper , we estimate that the average fraction of particles which can in principle be detected grows up to @xmath136 after a wimp scattering event .    to quantify the channeling potentiality of our cnt lattice as a whole with respect to the single nanotube case",
    ", we can also introduce an acceptance angle , @xmath137 .",
    "specifically , the acceptance angle is calculated in such a way that the integral over the ion recoil distribution up to @xmath137 is equal to the fraction of channeled top events , namely those events which reach the top end satisfying channeling conditions .",
    "the computed value for the cnt array is @xmath138 , while that for the single nanotube , calculated by using the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath139 .",
    "thus , an increase in the detector efficiency of the lattice as a whole , with respect to the single nanotube , can be translated in terms of a larger detector acceptance .",
    "such an improvement has obvious consequences on the construction specifications of a dark matter detector , especially in terms of target mass .",
    "testing experimentally the single carbon nanotube array unit , with electron or neutron probes for example , will finally tell to which extent the approximation used in our calculations are realistic .",

    ". see fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] ( left panel ) .      for @xmath145",
    ", the particle motion in the elementary square cell can be regarded as ergodic .",
    "thus , the probability that a particle leaves the cell in a time smaller than @xmath143 is given by the ratio between the phase space available to exit , which we call @xmath146 , and the total phase space , @xmath147 .",
    "the total volume of the phase space of the cell is @xmath148 , with @xmath149 .",
    "the calculation of the phase space available to exit the cell is more complex and will be discussed in the following .",
