    "the understanding of energetic phenomena due to star formation and/or an agn observed in nearby galaxies is of crucial importance to explaining the output luminosity produced by ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( l@xmath1@xmath210@xmath3l@xmath4 , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent studies based on near - ir , mid - ir ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and x - ray ( @xcite ) observations indicate that those galaxies are probably dominated by starbursts over their global infrared luminosity , even though weak agns may still be present in most of them .",
    "the possible detection of weak agns in all ultra - luminous galaxies is still plausible and necessitates powerful diagnostics .    in this paper , we examine the mid - ir spectral properties observed in the central region of the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) . due to the proximity of this galaxy ( 14.4mpc , 1@xmath5=72pc ) , we can disentangle the agn from the star formation regions found at 20@xmath5 from the nucleus .",
    "a comparative study of their respective mid - ir emission will be presented in order to point out , in a more general way , different methods for distinguishing an agn within a dominant starburst environment .",
    "the galaxy ngc 1068 was observed with the isocam camera ( @xcite ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso , @xcite ) .",
    "it is part of the active galaxy proposal camactiv ( p.i .",
    "mirabel ) , which contains 29 nearby galaxies hosting star formation activity and agn signatures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the circular variable filter ( cvf ) for mapping the central region of ngc 1068 ( 96@xmath5@xmath696@xmath5 ) continuously from 5 to 16@xmath0 m with a spectral resolution of @xmath740 .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the cam interactive analysis software ( cia ) and calibration followed the general methods described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the jitter effect due to the satellite motions ( amplitude @xmath7 0.5arcsec ) which severely affects the flux distribution of the bright point - like nucleus was corrected using shift techniques .",
    "we also applied aperture corrections to account for the overall extension of the psf .",
    "the absolute uncertainty of our photometric measurements is @xmath720@xmath8 , while the error in the relative flux uncertainty mainly due to limitations on transient effect correction is @xmath710@xmath8 .",
    "in figure [ laurento1 ] , we present mid - ir spectra and images of ngc1068 obtained with isocam . the emission between 5 and 16@xmath0 m is clearly dominated by the agn .",
    "nevertheless , faint extended starburst emission is observed along the northeast - southwest axis ( see upper and lower right panels ) .",
    "one may notice that the agn and the faint surrounding starburst have distinctly different mid - ir properties :    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + [ table ]    @xmath9 the most striking difference is the absence of the family of uibs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.7@xmath0 m in the agn spectrum .",
    "the uibs originate mainly from photo - dissociation regions surrounding hii regions , and as a consequence , they are naturally associated with the starburst activity .",
    "this depletion of the uib carriers may indicate their destruction by the hard radiation field from the agn , as is observed in well - resolved pure galactic hii regions as well as in some low - metallicity starburst galaxies .",
    "the relative decrease of uib strength can be used as a good indicator for distinguishing the agn from the starburst regions , which are composed of pdrs and hii regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ @xmath9 the agn spectrum presents a noticeable continuum at short wavelengths ( 5 - 10@xmath0 m ) , commonly attributed to hot dust , associated with the torus of molecular gas proposed in the unified model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some intense hii regions present a similar continuum , but only in regions of a few parsecs in size located close to hot stars with up to 10@xmath10 the solar radiation field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , this continuum has never been reported in starburst regions on large spatial scales ( @xmath2100pc ) , and thus its presence constitutes very strong evidence for an agn .",
    "+ @xmath9 the large variety of ionic emission lines , with ionization potential ranging from 22ev for [ arii ] up to 126ev for [ nevi ] can be used to estimate the hardness of the radiation field ( see table [ table ] ) .",
    "highly ionized species tracing the hard radiation field of the agn ( e.g. [ nev]14.3@xmath0 m and [ nevi]7.6@xmath0 m ) are detected in ngc1068 . however , due to the low spectral resolution of isocam spectra ( @xmath1140 ) , their detection in other nearby agns is still difficult and requires higher resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the [ nev ] emission line can also be induced by shocks such as those created by supernova remnants ( snrs ) . the very weak mid - ir continuum associated with snrs , though , rules out the possibility that there is a strong contribution of snrs to the agn environment ( @xcite ) , and the detection of these lines still represents the most direct way of identifying agns .    in table",
    "[ table ] , we summarize the overall properties of agn and starburst mid - ir emission between 5 and 16@xmath0 m . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss how dust extinction in starbursts and agns may lead us to underestimate the agn component .",
    "according to the unified picture of agns proposed by @xcite , the central engine ( a massive black hole accreting material ) is surrounded by a dusty molecular torus .",
    "the additional absorption caused by this torus would normally decrease the intrinsic luminosity of the agn compared to the adjacent starburst regions .",
    "this leads to the seyfert 2/seyfert 1 optical classification , depending on whether the torus is observed edge - on or face - on . studying a sample of 28 seyfert 1 and 29 seyfert 2 galaxies with isophot - s , schulz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have already shown that the high absorption in seyfert 2 galaxies blocks a large fraction ( 90@xmath8 on average ) of the mid - ir continuum from the agn inner torus . in figure",
    "[ laurento2 ] , we show the consequences for the mid - ir spectrum if additional extinction is applied to the agn continuum of ngc1068 . as the extinction increases ,",
    "the continuum at 5 - 10@xmath0 m , used as a good agn indicator , becomes less detectable than the uib emission , causing us to classify this galaxy as dominated by a starburst above a@xmath12=100 .",
    "thanks to iso , our knowledge of the mid - ir properties of starbursts and agns has been substantially improved through observations of nearby prototypical objects . in particular , different diagnostics were developed to obtain a quantitative classification of starburst and agn - dominated galaxies using their mid - ir emission . a faint uib to continuum ratio ( @xcite ) and the detection of a strong continuum at 5@xmath0 m ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    "are only observed in galaxies containing an agn .",
    "nevertheless , the accuracy of the estimate depends strongly on the signal to noise of the spectra ( see for example fig .",
    "[ laurento3 ] ) .",
    "another diagnostic for distinguishing agns from starbursts is the ratios of high to low excitation ionic lines , such as [ nev]/[neii ] or [ oiv]/[neii ] , which probe the hardness of the radiation field ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the detection of the [ nev ] and [ oiv ] emission lines with iso - sws , which directly traces the presence of the agn , is still limited to very nearby luminous objects .",
    "sirtf , the next infrared space telescope , and in particular its mid - ir spectrograph irs ( @xcite ) , which is expected to be nearly 400 times more sensitive than iso - sws , will be able to examine the possible presence of weak agns in luminous galaxies .",
    "the use of emission line ratios such as [ siii]18.7@xmath0m/[siii]33.5@xmath0 m ( @xcite ) or the 7.7uib/6.2uib ratio ( @xcite ) will also provide us other independent estimates of absorption in a larger sample of active galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the full coverage from 5.3 to 40@xmath0 m will permit us to better estimate the effects of the absorption using the 9.7 and 18@xmath0 m silicate features as well as reveal the presence of a faint hot dust contribution associated with intrinsically weak or obscured agns ."
