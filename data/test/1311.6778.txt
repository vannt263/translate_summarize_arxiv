    "blind surveys for optical transients have revealed a class of super - luminous supernovae ( sl ) sne that may in some cases be powered by a collision between the sn ejecta and a massive shell or wind of circumstellar material ( csm )  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and 2008es  @xcite , among others . as a consequence of the collision with the csm , a significant fraction of the kinetic energy is converted into radiation via shock dissipation , which is responsible for the observed emission ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the rate of slsne with absolute magnitude @xmath1 is order of @xmath2 , @xmath3% of the normal core - collapse sn rate  @xcite , but some normal - luminosity sne such as sn 2005ip  @xcite , 2006jc  @xcite , 2008iy  @xcite and ptf 09uj  @xcite , which may also be powered by ejecta - csm interactions , are more common  @xcite . finally , recent observations of sn 2009ip and 2010mc suggest that the csm eruption is timed to occur months - to - years before the core collapse  @xcite",
    ".    interaction - powered sne may be efficient cosmic - ray ( cr ) accelerators , where one can expect that the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism operates at the forward and reverse shocks by a collision between the sn ejecta and csm . for a range of csm parameters ( mass and shock dissipation radius ) , the shock is radiation - mediated  the thomson optical depth is larger than @xmath4  @xcite , where @xmath5 is the shock velocity  and efficient cr acceleration is not expected because the cr collisionless mean free path is much shorter than the deceleration length .",
    "however , as the shock propagates in the csm , photons can stream out ahead of the shock , and photon energy can no longer support the shock ( i.e. , shock breakout ) .",
    "after the breakout , for wind - like csm profiles , the shock will become collisonless and cr acceleration can be efficient  @xcite .",
    "recently , murase et al .",
    "( 2011 ) considered a collision between the sn ejecta with a csm shell and found that cr protons may be accelerated , and furthermore that the protons may experience strong pionic losses via inelastic @xmath0 collisions , producing gamma - rays and neutrinos .",
    "thus , interaction - powered sne may be interesting cr accelerators and high - energy / multi - messenger emitters . in this work",
    ", we continue our study of the possibility of the non - thermal emission from the shock interaction of a sn embedded in a dense csm . in particular , we focus on the secondary electrons and positrons expected from the same @xmath0 collisions that give rise to neutrinos and gamma rays .",
    "importantly , we show that these secondaries can emit detectable synchrotron radiation at high - frequency radio wavelengths including mm / submm and fir bands .    in section 2",
    ", we review the shock physics and the potential for cr acceleration in interaction - powered sne , providing a much more detailed discussion than murase et al .",
    "section 3 gives a brief discussion of the high - energy emission expected , and recipes that connect the observed optical emission to the non - thermal signatures are provided in appendix a. in section 4 we discuss high - frequency radio diagnostics . for a range of csm parameters , we show that secondary leptons from @xmath0 interactions should radiate synchrotron at @xmath6 , and with fluxes of @xmath7  mjy at distances of hundreds of mpc . in section 5 , we summarize our results .    throughout this work ,",
    "we use the notation @xmath8 in cgs unit unless we give notice .",
    "in this preparatory section , before we discuss non - thermal signatures , we explain the picture of interaction - powered sne and describe the basic physical setup .",
    "let us consider sn ejecta with the kinetic energy @xmath9 and the velocity @xmath10 .",
    "noting @xmath11 for the ejecta mass @xmath12 , the momentum and energy conservation laws give @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total csm mass and @xmath15 is the csm velocity .",
    "the total dissipated energy @xmath16 is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is used in the last equality .",
    "the above equation suggests that a significant fraction of @xmath9 can be dissipated if the csm mass is large  ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "density profiles of both the ejecta and csm are important for detailed predictions .",
    "for example , when the density profile of the ejecta is steep enough and most of its energy is carried by lower - velocity ejecta material , the explosion has driven waves that can be described by chevalier - nadezhin self - similar solutions  @xcite .",
    "when the shock wave sweeps up ambient mass comparable to @xmath12 and it is non - radiative , we expect blast waves that can be described by sedov - taylor - like self - similar solutions  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this work , to push the basic idea and avoid uncertainty in the ejecta profile and many other complications due to radiation processes , we discuss non - thermal properties without relying on such details .",
    "our treatment still provides an order of magnitude estimate of expected non - thermal signals , and a more detailed study will be presented in an accompanying paper  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we assume that the csm has a wind - like power - law density profile and extends to the edge radius of the wind , @xmath19 .",
    "we expect that this is reasonable  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although details are uncertain due to poor understandings of the csm eruption mechanism .",
    "then , the csm density is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 should be expressed in cm , @xmath22  cm , and @xmath23 is defined   that is different from ours . ] for the mass - loss rate of @xmath24 and the wind velocity of @xmath25 .",
    "this can also be expressed by @xmath26 the csm mass within @xmath21 is estimated to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the csm inner edge radius . in particular , in the wind case ( @xmath29 ) , we have @xmath30 where we have used @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that , in the one - zone model where the calculation is performed for a csm density @xmath33 at a given radius @xmath21 , qualitative pictures for different density profiles are simply obtained by using @xmath14 instead of @xmath34 ( although the dynamics and temporal evolution depend on density profiles ) .",
    "the deceleration is significant after the ejecta accumulates the csm mass equivalent to its own mass , whose radius is characterized by @xmath35 if @xmath36 , most of the ejecta energy is dissipated by the ejecta - csm collision .",
    "one of the important quantities is the thomson optical depth . using the csm electron density , @xmath37 the thomson optical depth",
    "is estimated to be @xmath38 for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the thomson optical depth in the downstream is also @xmath41 although the density in the thin , interacting shell is compressed by the shock compression ratio . as seen below",
    ", the emission is mostly observed when @xmath42 after photons can leave the system . however , while the interaction with a dense csm shell happens at @xmath43 , hard x rays and soft gamma rays produced at the shock can not avoid compton down - scattering and a significant fraction of the emission would be thermalized  @xcite .",
    "equal lines of various optical depths , csm density and luminosities in the ( @xmath21 , @xmath44 ) plane and ( @xmath21 , @xmath14 ) plane are shown in figures  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the equal csm density line , @xmath45 , is also overlaid .",
    "explanations for the optical depths other than the thomson optical depth are given below .",
    "as argued by murase et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , efficient cr acceleration is possible at @xmath42 , and for @xmath46 we expect almost all the accelerated cr ions to produce neutrinos , hadronic gamma rays , and secondary electrons and positrons . in the system , hadronic gamma rays can interact with photons via the two - photon annihilation process and/or matter via the bethe - heitler ( bh ) pair - production process , respectively ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the attenuation of gev gamma rays due to the bh process is insignificant at @xmath47 , which is not far from @xmath48 .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the forward shock , so the shock velocity @xmath5 is regarded as the forward shock velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the reverse shock power is smaller when the ejecta profile is steep  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but this might not be the case if the profile is changed , e.g. , possibly by experiencing many interactions with many csm shells .    , @xmath44 ) plane .",
    "see the text for meanings of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the shaded region suggests the range where we do not expect either production or escape of gamma rays .",
    "the thick curves represent @xmath54 while the thin curves do @xmath55 . with quadruplicate - dotted cures , lines of the constant csm density ( @xmath33=const . ) , constant post - breakout radiation luminosity ( @xmath56=const . ) , constant optically - thin free - free luminosity ( @xmath57=const . ) , and constant csm mass ( @xmath14=const . )",

    "we expect that thermal radiation carries a significant fraction ( @xmath74 ) of the energy carried by the interacting shell ( @xmath75 ) , where the radiated energy  , @xmath76 is obtained in the mini - shell model  @xcite .",

    "the collision between the sn ejecta and the csm may start from the optically - thick regime .",
    "then , after the shock breakout , the interaction eventually enters the optically - thin regime .",
    "this regime typically comes after the time of @xmath83 when @xmath19 is large enough .",
    "hence , for optically slsne such as sn 2006gy , it usually happens only after the shock crosses @xmath84 . in order to expect optically - thin ejecta - csm interactions within @xmath19 ,",
    "relatively large @xmath85 and/or low @xmath14 are needed .",
    "alternately , the collision may occur at @xmath42 if csm effectively has an inner edge and can be regarded as a shell . especially for",
    "optically - thin interactions at @xmath86 , hard x rays easily leave the system although ultraviolet photons and soft x rays may be attenuated due to bound - free absorption .",
    "indeed , such x - ray and radio emissions have been observed in some sne like sn 1988z  @xcite and 2006jd  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a csm extending to @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath87 , the characteristic duration of emission is expected to be @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) . when the dominant loss process for thermal electrons is the free - free emission , the ( bolometric ) radiation luminosity mainly comes from bremsstrahlung emission . in the non - radiative case ,",
    "we have  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the gaunt factor , @xmath92 for hydrogen is used , and absorption is not considered yet  . here",
    "the compression factor @xmath93 is taken to be 4 but can be larger .",
    "the constant radiation luminosity line , @xmath94 , is depicted in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "when the shock is radiative , @xmath95 should be limited by the kinetic luminosity as in equation  ( 11 ) .",

    "note that @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath98 and @xmath99  k is assumed , otherwise cooling by line emissions becomes relevant  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .      whether efficient cr acceleration occurs or not depends on the shock properties .",
    "when an ejecta - csm collision occurs at sufficiently small radii , the shock is initially radiation - mediated in the sense that the upstream shock structure is modified by radiation from the downstream . for non - relativistic shocks where effects of pairs are irrelevant",
    ", the shock is radiation - mediated when @xmath64  @xcite . when coupling with radiation is strong enough , electrons transfer their energy to photons . in the thermal equilibrium limit ,",
    "at the far downstream , photons , electrons and protons have the temperature of @xmath100 where @xmath101 is used and @xmath102 is the gray - body factor .",
    "note that this emission does not have to be the observed emission since photons start to escape only after @xmath103 .",
    "thermal equilibrium may not be realized if sufficient photons are not produced by the bremsstrahlung process  @xcite . at the nearer downstream ,",
    "protons and electrons have much higher temperatures . in the absence of collisionless - plasma processes ,",
    "the electron temperature is determined by the balance between coulomb heating and cooling processes .",
    "when the relevant cooling process is the compton cooling , we have  @xcite @xmath104 over the length scale of @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is the ion - electron collision frequency ) , where   is defined for the downstream energy density . on the other hand , as in murase et al .",

    "@xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the energy density of photons .",
    "note that the above equation is valid for sufficiently high - velocity shocks , since @xmath111 is limited by the proton temperature @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "in reality , collisionless - plasma processes can be faster than coulomb collisional processes , where @xmath111 can be higher than in equation  ( 14 ) , but should be lower than the equipartition temperature .",
    "after @xmath42 , the shock is no longer radiation - mediated , and we expect collisionless ( or collisional ) shocks .",
    "for strong , non - relativistic shocks , the proton temperature at the immediate downstream is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the adiabatic index . when the adiabatic index is @xmath115 , we have a well - known result , @xmath116 .",
    "the electron temperature is affected by energy transfer from protons , which may be coulomb heating or faster collisionless plasma processes .",
    "if @xmath115 and when electrons and protons achieve the equipartition , we have  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath117    therefore , in the interaction - powered sn scenario , we can naturally expect x rays via bremsstrahlung or inverse - compton ( ic ) processes since electrons should be heated by the shock  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , we may assume the material is highly ionized at least in the immediate upstream .",
    "detections of x rays allow us to probe the existence of strong shocks , supporting the scenario  @xcite .",
    "however , there are several complications .",
    "first , free - free emission may be suppressed if thermal electrons mainly cool via the ic process . secondly ,",
    "when the ejecta - csm interaction occurs at @xmath118 , hard x rays lose their energies in both the emission zone ( downstream ) and screen zone ( upstream ) , and softer x rays are down - graded via bound - free absorption .",
    "if the amount of non - ionized atoms similarly exists in the far upstream , the bound - free optical depth for soft x rays is roughly estimated to be  ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath119 at @xmath120  kev .",
    "naively , the x - ray luminosity is then  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the suppression by other losses , @xmath123 is the optical depth in the emission zone and @xmath124 is the optical depth in the screen zone .",
    "predictions for both the thermal and non - thermal x rays depend on details including the frequency - dependent opacity and the ionization in the upstream  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this work does not study x - ray emissions in detail , since non - thermal x rays can be largely contaminated or masked by thermal x rays .",
    "now , we consider particle acceleration .",
    "cr acceleration may become efficient when the shock is no longer radiation - mediated and becomes collisionless , which can be realized when @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "strong small - scale magnetic fields are expected as a result from plasma instabilities , and mhd mechanisms such as the turbulent dynamo   can also play crucial roles especially in the downstream  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , crs themselves excite turbulence via cr stream instabilities , which can be important in the upstream  ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "since details of these processes are uncertain , for simplicity , we parameterize the magnetic field with the ratio of @xmath125 to @xmath126 as @xmath127 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath128 in the bohm limit , the proton acceleration time scale is estimated to be  ( see a review * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath129 and the proton maximum energy is estimated by comparing it to various cooling time scales ( see below ) . in the fully - ionized plasma ( that is the case in the vicinity of the shock ) , the coulomb cooling time of thermal protons  @xcite , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is assumed but the velocity of injected protons may be higher , depending on details of injection processes .",
    "the ratio between the two is @xmath132 when the upstream is cold enough .",
    "hence , the coulomb energy loss timescale is longer than their acceleration time , so cr proton acceleration is possible .",
    "note that the coulomb cooling is much less relevant in the immediate downstream , where the temperature is much higher .",
    "as protons are accelerated above the pion production threshold , @xmath133 , inelastic @xmath0 interactions occur , leading to production of electrons and positrons via @xmath134 .",
    "their minimum injection lorentz factor is  @xcite @xmath135 the important point here is that the minimum injection lorentz factor is unique for hadronic injections , which is different from the case of primary electron acceleration .",
    "primary electrons can also be shock accelerated via the fermi acceleration mechanism . however , the larmor radius of thermal electrons is smaller than that of thermal protons .",
    "thus , electrons need to be energized via some plasma processes to cross the shock length and to get injected to the fermi acceleration process . in other words , the larmor radius of relativistic electrons , @xmath136 , should be larger than that of thermal protons , @xmath137",
    ". the lorentz factor of elections that can be accelerated by the conventional shock acceleration mechanism satisfies @xmath138 keeping this in mind and introducing the energy fraction ( @xmath139 ) and number fraction ( @xmath140 ) of relativistic electrons distributed with a power law , the injection lorentz factor of primary shock - accelerated electrons ( @xmath141 ) is expressed as @xmath142 where @xmath143 for @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 . here",
    ", @xmath147 is the injection spectral index of accelerated electrons and @xmath148 is the maximum lorentz factor of accelerated electrons . note that equation ( 24 ) is obtained from @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",

    "sufficiently large values of @xmath140 imply @xmath153 , where other electron acceleration processes in the shock transition layer should be relevant , and the spectrum for @xmath154 may be steeper than that for @xmath155 .",
    "the energy carried by accelerated crs can be summarized as follows .",
    "the cr acceleration is efficient only after the radiation escapes from the system and the strong shock jump is formed by collisionless shocks .",

    "when particles are accelerated up to very high energies , high - energy gamma rays and neutrinos should be accompanied via hadronuclear interactions like the @xmath0 reaction . in particular ,",
    "cr protons interact with nucleons while they are advected to the downstream , so neutrinos and pionic gamma rays are expected in the gev - pev range  @xcite . by comparing the @xmath0 interaction time scale @xmath168 and @xmath169",

    "the temperature may indeed be high enough , as suggested by successful radio detections of sn 2006jd  @xcite . in figure 7 ,",
    "sn 2006jd   lies near the lines of @xmath452 and @xmath430 . on the other hand , non - detections of radio emission from many other type iin sne like",
    "sn 2010jl seem consistent with the large absorption that is easily realized with more conservative values of @xmath460  k  @xcite .    at @xmath457  ghz ,",
    "as shown in figures  6 and 7 , the free - free absorption and ssa processes suppress radio signals , and the parameter space around @xmath401 is located in the dark shaded area .",
    "so it is difficult to see hadronic signatures with synchrotron emission at radio wavelengths .",
    "but the situation drastically changes at higher frequencies . at @xmath456  ghz ,",
    "the free - free absorption is still an obstacle for ejecta - csm interactions at @xmath461  cm , but not for @xmath458  cm .",
    "importantly , as shown in figures  8 and 9 , a large parameter space of @xmath401 is free of absorption and scattering processes .",
    "so observations at high - frequency radio wavelengths including mm / submm and fir bands are indeed powerful to test the hadronic model and probe cosmic - ray proton acceleration . at higher frequencies such as 1000  ghz ,",
    "all the absorption processes discussed here are negligible compared to the comptonization due to thermal electrons .",
    "not all interaction - powered sne allow us to expect high - frequency radio signals from secondaries . as pointed out by murase et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , except at sufficiently late phases , optically - bright slsne are difficult to detect with synchrotron emission at radio bands . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in figures 9 and 11 , some type iin sne such as sn 2006jd and 2008iy seem very promising .",
    "there are some possibilities that we have effectively lower values of @xmath462 .",
    "first , the csm may be anisotropic or clumpy as suggested in several type iin sne like sn 2005ip  @xcite and 2009ip  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , where the emission more easily escape from partial regions where the csm density is much lower .",
    "secondly , @xmath462 is smaller when the csm is little ionized , which may be realized especially in the far upstream .",
    "this is different from soft x rays that are more strongly absorbed in the non - ionized csm .",
    "such more transparent cases correspond to the light shaded area in figures  6 - 11 .",
    "note that the free - free optical depth declines after the shock reaches the outer edge of csm , @xmath19 .",
    "after @xmath463 , it becomes @xmath464 where @xmath465 ( at @xmath466 ) is assumed .",
    "for example , a possible value of @xmath467 is suggested in the late phase of the re - brightening of sn 2009ip  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we provide a broad discussion of multi - messenger diagnoses of interaction - powered sne including type iin sne and some slsne , focusing on non - thermal signals",
    ". the shock would be radiation - mediated at very early times , and thus cr acceleration is inefficient . however , as photons escape the system , a collisionless shock can form and cr acceleration becomes possible .",
    "while shock heating leads to x rays , crs are expected to produce broadband non - thermal emission , including gamma rays , x rays , radio waves and neutrinos .",
    "photon emission in general may be largely thermalized depending the optical depth , which in turn depends on details of the csm .",
    "neutrinos are the most direct probe in the sense that they do not suffer from attenuation in the source . in addition , by advancing the idea proposed by murase et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we have shown that gev gamma rays can typically escape after the shock breakout , although tev gamma rays are attenuated due to the two - photon annihilation process  .",
    "along with neutrinos , gev gamma rays can provide unique opportunities to probe the formation of collisionless shocks and the onset of cr acceleration .",
    "interestingly , the physical parameters suggested by observed interaction - powered sne imply densities similar to those inferred from gamma - ray novae  @xcite , allowing us to expect analogous high - energy emission and to probe the physics of cr acceleration in the dense environment . detecting signals from one sn",
    "requires a nearby event , but stacking analyses are still useful .",
    "gamma rays and neutrinos are especially powerful for optically - bright slsne , for which the recipes provided in appendix a can be used .    for normal luminosity interaction - powered sne , broad - band non - thermal emissions from radio to tev gamma - ray bands are possible .",
    "in particular , high - frequency radio observations in the mm / submm and fir bands can probe cr proton acceleration and test the hadronic model .",
    "we pointed out that secondary electrons produced via @xmath0 reactions play an important pole role in the synchrotron emission from some interaction - powered sne such as sn 2006jd .",
    "comprehensive observations from ghz to 1000  ghz may also be relevant to study acceleration of primary electrons that may not be accelerated by the conventional shock acceleration .",
    "our work demonstrates the importance of multi - messenger approaches in revealing the mechanism of type iin sne and cr acceleration in real time .",
    "the interaction - powered sn scenario has been commonly used to interpret slsne , but slsne are diverse and other scenarios also possible .",
    "for example , some slsne such as sn 2007bi may be rather pair - instability sne originating from progenitors with @xmath468 , where the stellar collapse is caused by the pressure decrease due to electron - positron pair - production  @xcite . or luminous sne including slsne ic  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be driven by newborn pulsars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some slsne seem difficult to explain using these scenarios  @xcite .",
    "high - energy emissions including gamma rays and neutrinos have been predicted in both the interaction - powered sn scenario  @xcite and the pulsar - driven sn scenario  @xcite .",
    "detecting thermal and non - thermal signals from shocks in the dense csm and studying time - dependent spectra are crucial in order to discriminate among the scenarios .",
    "the most important point of this work is that secondary electrons and positrons from inelastic @xmath0 collisions will radiate detectable synchrotron photons efficiently at high - frequency radio wavelengths including the mm / submm and fir bands .",
    "although details depend on the mass of csm , its physical location relative to the progenitor star at the time of explosion , and the velocity of the ejecta , for typical parameters , we expect the synchrotron spectrum to peak at @xmath469  ghz and with flux of @xmath7  mjy for 2006jd - like interaction - powered sne at distances of hundreds of mpc .",
    "in particular , high - frequency radio signals using instruments like the high - frequency channels of the vla and alma can be very powerful to probe physics of collisionless shocks .",
    "for this reason , we encourage followup observations especially at the mm / submm band within months - to - years and at the gev - tev gamma - ray band within days - to - years .",

    "here , we provide recipes to test the hadronic model for gamma - ray and neutrino emissions from interaction - powered sne . basically , we need to know two quantities , the cr energy @xmath470 and the @xmath0 efficiency @xmath286 .",
    "the latter depends on @xmath33 , @xmath21 and @xmath5 , which can be determined from the breakout emission .",
    "the more sophisticated approach is possible based on self - similar solutions in the engine - driven case  @xcite .",
    "we here overview the prescription by chevalier & irwin ( 2011 ) .",
    "let us consider the ejecta whose outer density profile is @xmath471 at @xmath472 .",
    "the shock is initially radiation - mediated and the flows are radiation - dominated since @xmath473 .",
    "the contact discontinuity is located at @xmath474 , where @xmath475 .",
    "the forward shock radius is estimated to be @xmath476 and the forward shock velocity is @xmath477 .",
    "the energy carried by the interacting shell is estimated to be @xmath478 , where @xmath479 . for @xmath480 ,",
    "the radiation energy is @xmath481 , so we have @xmath482 in the wind case , the photon diffusion timescale is comparable to the breakout time , and we have @xmath483 as long as the breakout happens at @xmath484 . the breakout radius can also be estimated from the evolution of the radiation luminosity and temperature if the black - body approximation is valid , or if @xmath49 is known .    as a result ,",
    "if we can observe @xmath178 , @xmath65 and @xmath49 ( or @xmath67 ) , we can evaluate @xmath44 , @xmath485 and @xmath486 as  @xcite @xmath487 @xmath488 @xmath489 one should keep in mind that the engine - driven self - similar solution is valid as long as @xmath490 .",
    "then , we can estimate @xmath33 , allowing us to calculate @xmath286 and resulting neutrino and gamma - ray spectra .",
    "there are two important free parameters , the cr spectral index ( @xmath288 ) and cr energy ( @xmath470 ) . for @xmath491 ,",
    "the cr proton spectrum is given by @xmath492 and @xmath493 for our typical parameters .",
    "for @xmath494 , we have @xmath495 here , @xmath274 is the conversion factor from the total energy to the differential energy spectrum and @xmath496 is the minimum proton energy .",
    "these equations can be rewritten as @xmath497 where @xmath498 .",
    "the cr energy is parametrized as @xmath499 where @xmath500 is the cr loading parameter that is commonly introduced in the literature of hadronic emissions from gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath165 and @xmath501 are order of 0.1 , we expect @xmath502 and we can make predictions for breakout high - energy emissions , based on observational quantities . such an application was done in margutti et al .",
    "note that high - energy emissions continue after the breakout . given sufficient time - dependent data ,",
    "later contributions can easily be taken into account by more detailed modeling .",
    "for example , one can directly use self - similar solutions for @xmath480 or @xmath115 at @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "most naively , instead , the overall contribution can be incorporated in the cr loading parameter .",
    "here we provide formulas to calculate ssa . for a power - law electron distribution ,",
    "the ssa coefficient is  @xcite @xmath503 where @xmath504 is the angle between the electron velocity and magnetic field .",
    "the normalization is determined by @xmath505 assuming @xmath506\\gg\\gamma_n={\\rm min}[\\gamma_i,\\gamma_c]$ ] , we have @xmath507 , where @xmath508 for @xmath509 and @xmath510 for @xmath511 .",
    "when only the synchrotron emission is relevant , we have @xmath413 at @xmath414 in the fast cooling case or @xmath415 at @xmath416 in the slow cooling case . averaged over @xmath504 ,",
    "the ssa coefficient is written as @xmath512 where @xmath513 for example , we obtain @xmath514 for @xmath413 and @xmath515 for @xmath434 , respectively .    note",
    "that the spectrum in the optically - thick limit is obtained from @xmath516 , where @xmath517 is the synchrotron emissivity  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient agrees with katz ( 2012 ) .",
