    "galaxy formation and evolution is one of the most fascinating topics in astrophysical research today . along several main pathways we are trying to answer the question of how galaxies are formed and how they evolve over time within a cosmological framework for structure formation .",
    "theoretically this is often done via numerical n - body / sph simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or semi - analytical modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite the associated observational part could be divided into doing _ near - field cosmology _ , i.e.  looking for the fossil records of the galaxy formation and evolution process by observing local galaxies in detail , or doing _ far - field cosmology _ ,",
    "i.e.  looking at distant objects for the progenitors of modern - day galaxies .",
    "although it is now observationally possible to obtain spatially resolved kinematics and emission - line measurements as a function of radius out to a redshift of @xmath0 @xcite , surface photometry is still a valuable source of information . by modelling the surface - brightness distribution of a galaxy and thereby parametrising the individual components , we can obtain a common ground to measure , compare , and sort large samples of galaxies .",
    "the structures we observe , our fossil records , should be linked to the galaxy assembly .",
    "to create a local reference data set for comparison with high redshift galaxies we have collected imaging data for two large , complementary samples of face - on to intermediate inclined disk galaxies .",
    "the first is a diameter and distance limited sample of early - type galaxies ( s0-sb ) split into two subsamples : 66 strong- or weakly barred galaxies @xcite and 45 unbarred galaxies ( aladro et al .",
    ", this volume ) both drawn from the ugc catalog .",
    "the images are obtained with a variety of different telescopes including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , dr5 ) . the second sample is a volume limited sample ( @xmath1mpc ) down to a limiting magnitude ( @xmath2b - mag ) of late - type ( sb - sdm ) galaxies by @xcite .",
    "it comprises all selected galaxies from the leda on - line catalog having useful imaging data available in the sdss ( dr2 ) , the sole data source for this study .",
    "details about the extraction of the analyzed surface brightness profiles can be found in the cited papers . in our analysis",
    "we concentrated not only on providing statistics on the exponential disk as given by @xcite or @xcite , but rather study the shape of the profiles , as not all indeed only the minority are well described with a single exponential fitting function . to do so , we revised and extended the classification of surface brightness profiles introduced in the pioneering paper by @xcite including the so called truncation of the stellar population at the edge of the disk discovered by @xcite .",
    "we identified three basic classes of surface brightness profiles depending on an apparent break feature or lack of one ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) : 1 ) the well known freeman type  i that has an exponential profile , with no break .",
    "2 ) type  ii with a downbending break , now including the truncations .",
    "3 ) a completely new class , called type  iii , also described by a broken exponential but with an upbending profile , shallower beyond the break .",
    "the latter , discovered by @xcite , is also termed _ anitruncated _ since showing the opposite behavior to the well known truncated profiles .",
    "we have taken great care in ensuring that the critical sky subtraction is done properly , therefore always providing lower levels down to where we trust our profiles ( cf .",
    "it turns out that the uncertainty in our sky subtraction , in almost all cases , does not interfere with the basic classification of a galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that there are now completely independent measurements ( from resolved star counts ) of three local counterparts for each of our main types .",
    "there is ngc300 @xcite , where an unchanging exponential has been detected out to as far as ten scalelengths , m33 @xcite , where the profile is well fitted by a broken exponential with a downbending break , and m31 @xcite , which could be regarded as a type  iii ( antitruncated ) disk .    in order to address the origin of the different types",
    "we have introduced an interpretative subclassification scheme for our profiles .",
    "for example , we distinguish between those type  ii profiles possibly associated with a bar resonance , called type  ii.o - olr , and those probably related to a star - formation threshold , called _ classical truncation _ or type  ii - ct ( see next section , as well as erwin et al . and aladro et al . , this volume ) .",
    "evidence about the origin may come from the trends we observed with hubble type ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "any model of galaxy formation and evolution should be able to explain why we find for example more type  ii - ct cases in late - type than early - type galaxies , whereas the trend is the other way around for the type  i galaxies .",
    "our basic classification is simply morphological in nature",
    ". we do pure taxonomy similar to grouping galaxies along the hubble sequence .",
    "but what is the physical background for the different types , what does theory tell us about surface brightness profiles ?",
    "it turn out our current physical picture lags behind the observational evidence .",
    "the origin of purely exponential disks ( type  i ) in itself is not fully understood , although well known since the 1940 - 50 s .",
    "one of the most successful attempts to show that an exponential disk can arise naturally out of disk formation conditions was by @xcite who showed that an exponential disk will form if the viscosity time scale and the star formation time scale are comparable .",
    "the currently favored model ascribes the classical truncations ( type  ii - ct ) to the effect of a star formation threshold in disk column density as the edge is approached @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , using purely collisionless @xmath3-body simulations @xcite find downbending breaks appearing in the disk profile as a resonance phenomenon , which may be associated to our type  ii.o - olr breaks .",
    "observationally , there is circumstantial evidence that some of the galaxies with type  iii profiles are associated with recent mergers ( e.g. m31 ) , supported now by the new n - body / sph simulations of @xcite showing that minor mergers could produce upbending stellar profiles in the remnant galaxy . on the other hand , by a small change of the input gas density @xcite are also able to produce type  iii profiles within their evolutionary model of an isolated galaxy with star formation .",
    "once the nature of the galactic stellar disk is determined it will be fully justified to use the shape of the profiles and the position of the breaks for comparison of galaxies at various redshifts as done by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a first direct application of the new classification scheme by exploring the hubble ultra deep field . using the position of the truncation as a direct estimator of the size of the stellar disk it becomes possible to observe inside - out growth of galactic disks inherent in the current galaxy formation and evolution models comparing the local late - type type  ii galaxies with their counterparts at high - z ( i.e.  @xmath0 ) in a straightforward manner .",
    "although still uncertain because of the small number of galaxies analyzed , their results suggest that the radial position of the truncation has increased with cosmic time by @xmath4 kpc in the last @xmath5gyr indicating a small to moderate ( @xmath6 ) inside - out growth of the disk galaxies since @xmath7 .",
