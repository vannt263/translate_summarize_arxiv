    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) constitute a large fraction of bright x - ray sources ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ) in the galaxy .",
    "these binary systems consist of an accreting compact star , either a neutron star or black hole , and a roche lobe - filling , low - mass companion .",
    "thus far approximately @xmath8200 lmxbs are known . among them",
    ", there is a class called ultracompact binaries .",
    "different from the majority of lmxbs which contain ordinary , hydrogen - rich mass donors , ultracompact systems are believed to consist of extremely low - mass , either hydrogen - poor or degenerate , companion stars @xcite . as a result , while ordinary lmxbs have a minimum orbital period around 80  min ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ultracompact systems can evolve to extraordinarily small binary separations with orbital periods as short as a few minutes @xcite .",
    "these ultracompact lmxbs , along with their white dwarf analogues ( the am cvn binaries ; see @xcite ) , represent extreme and exotic endpoints in binary and stellar evolution .",
    "while the ultracompact systems had initially been assumed to be relatively rare , the number known has more than doubled to 11 ( including 4 globular cluster sources ) over the past few years , with a range of orbital periods from 11 to 55 minutes @xcite .",
    "it is likely that there are more such binaries , because a few candidate systems have been identified either by their peculiar x - ray and/or optical spectral features ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or through their unusually low optical  to  x - ray flux ratios ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to fully study and understand the ultracompact lmxb population , verification of those candidate systems are warranted .",
    "it has shown that the indirect methods for ultracompact binary identification may not be reliable @xcite . in order to verify their ultracompact nature , time - resolved photometry for detecting orbital periodic signals",
    "is needed .",
    "moreover once ultra - short orbital periods are found , properties of the binary systems can be further estimated ( e.g. @xcite ) , helping our understanding of these systems . in an effort to verify the ultracompact nature of the proposed candidates , we have undertaken optical observations aiming to detect orbital flux modulations .",
    "we have successfully found the orbital period of the candidate 4u",
    "1543@xmath0624 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report our discovery of the likely orbital period of another candidate 2s  0918@xmath0549 .",
    "the lmxb 2s  0918@xmath0549  has been a bright x - ray source ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath7 ) and detected by all major x - ray satellites ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "on the basis of comparison of its x - ray spectrum to that of the known ultracompact lmxb 4u 1626@xmath067 , the source has been suggested to be an ultracompact binary with a neon - enriched degenerate donor @xcite .",
    "probably because the binary has a low inclination angle ( generally @xmath10 60 ; @xcite ) , no orbital signals were found in x - ray observations of the source @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart to 2s  0918@xmath0549  was identified by @xcite , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . based on its optical  to  x - ray flux ratio ,",
    "the orbital period of the binary has been suggested to be @xmath13 min @xcite .",
    "the source distance is probably 4.15.4 kpc , estimated from type - i x - ray bursts detected from the source @xcite .",
    "time - resolved imaging of 2s  0918@xmath0549   was carried out on 2008 december 5 using the 8-m gemini south telescope .",
    "the instrument was gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) , whose detector array consists of three 2048@xmath144608 eev ccds .",
    "we used only the middle ccd chip ( ccd  02 ) for imaging .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.073/pixel , while the detector was 2@xmath15 binned for our observation . a sloan @xmath1 filter with the central wavelength at 6300    was used .",
    "we obtained 179 continuous frames with an exposure time of approximately 24.5 sec . including 24 sec readout time for each exposure , the total length of the observation was approximately 2.4 hrs .",
    "the observing conditions during the early part of our observation ( first 59 frames ) were relatively poor , with the average seeing [ fwhm of the point - spread function ( psf ) of the images ] being @xmath16 and a few frames having as large as 1.3  1.5  seeing . for the remaining part , the conditions were good with most of the frames having @xmath17 seeing .",
    "we used the iraf packages for data reduction .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "the bias and flat frames were from gmos baseline calibrations taken during the same night .",
    "we performed psf - fitting photometry to obtain brightnesses of our target and other in - field stars , with a photometry program dophot @xcite used .",
    "a finding chart of the target field is shown in figure  [ fig : finding ] .",
    "as identified by @xcite , there is a nearby star ( labeled as @xmath18 ) 1.5away from our target . to avoid possible contamination from this nearby star caused by the poor observing conditions during the early part of our observation , we positionally calibrated the first 59 frames to a reference image that was combined from three high - quality frames .",
    "the positions of star @xmath18 and 2s  0918@xmath0549  were determined in the reference image , and were fixed at the positions for photometry of the first 59 frames .",
    "at last we excluded three frames among them from the data . from the three frames ,",
    "the brightness measurements of star @xmath18 and other in - field stars obtained were not consistent with the average brightnesses from other frames , and we note that the three frames have the seeing of 1.31.5 .",
    "differential photometry was performed to eliminate systematic flux variations in the images .",
    "three isolated , nonvariable bright stars in the field were used .",
    "the brightnesses of our targets and other stars in each frame were calculated relative to the total counts of the three stars .",
    "a field star labeled as @xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig : finding ] ) was used as a check star , as it was nonvariable and had similar brightness to our target .",
    "because we did not request observations of standard stars for flux calibration in our gemini program and also no standard stars were imaged in the same filter by the gemini south telescope within at least half a month before and after our observation , we used the @xmath20 magnitudes of star @xmath18 measured by @xcite to obtain absolute magnitudes of the target and other stars .",
    "the transformation formula between @xmath1 and @xmath20 magnitudes given by @xcite was used .",
    "we found an average @xmath1 magnitude of 20.95@xmath210.16 for 2s  0918@xmath0549 , where the uncertainty comes from the relatively large uncertainties on the @xmath20 magnitudes of star @xmath18 in @xcite .",
    "we note that with the same transformation , @xmath22 for 2s  0918@xmath0549  in @xcite , which indicates that the binary has not had significant changes in its optical brightness .",
    "the average @xmath1 magnitude of star @xmath19 was 20.98@xmath23 , where 0.02 mag is the standard deviation of star @xmath19 measured from 176 frames .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lc ] the obtained light curves of 2s  0918@xmath0549 , star @xmath18 , and the check star @xmath19 are shown . a periodic modulation in the light curve of 2s  0918@xmath0549 ,",
    "while with a low - amplitude , is clearly visible . to determine its period , we applied a phase - dispersion minimization technique @xcite with 16 bins of the full phase interval ( 0 , 1 ) used .",
    "the resulting periodogram is shown in figure  [ fig : pdm ] .",
    "the @xmath24 statistic indicates the detection of a periodicity and its two harmonics . fitting the region near the first minimum with a parabola @xcite",
    ", we found period @xmath25 min .    in order to quantify the overall periodic modulation in the light curve",
    ", we fit the light curve with a sinusoid .",
    "the best - fit has reduced @xmath26 for 172 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and from the best - fit we found @xmath27 min and a semiamplitude of 0.014@xmath210.002 mag .",
    "the large @xmath28 value is mainly caused by large scattering of the first 56 data points due to the poor observing conditions . excluding them and fitting the remaining data points , we found reduced @xmath29 for 117 dof ( @xmath30 was fixed at 17.4 min ) .",
    "the obtained semiamplitude was 0.015@xmath210.002 mag , not having significant changes .",
    "therefore the modulation can be described by a sinusoid with a semiamplitude of 0.015 mag .",
    "the folded light curve at @xmath25 min as well as the best - fit sinusoid are shown in figure  [ fig : folded ] .",
    "the time at the maximum of the sinusoidal fit ( phase zero ) was mjd 54805.23281@xmath210.00027 ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter .",
    "using gemini high time - resolution imaging we obtained an accurate optical light curve of 2s  0918@xmath0549  and have discovered a periodic flux modulation in the light curve .",
    "a low - amplitude modulation is clearly visible and appears to be coherent .",
    "given the known x - ray and optical properties of 2s  0918@xmath0549 , it is very likely that we have verified the ultracompact nature of this binary and its orbital period is around @xmath31 min ( see discussion below ) .",
    "in addition to 4u 0513@xmath040 in the globular cluster ngc  1851 @xcite and the galactic disk source 4u 1543@xmath0624 @xcite , 2s  0918@xmath0549  is the third member of the ultracompact binaries that have orbital periods around 18 min .",
    "we use the discovered orbital period to estimate the mass and radius of the donor .",
    "since the mean density of a roche lobe - filling companion is determined by the binary period , our 17 minute period defines a mass - radius relation for the companion , shown as the solid curve in figure  [ fig : mr ] . on the basis of the high ne",
    "/ o abundance ratio measured through x - ray spectroscopy , the donor in 2s  0918@xmath0549   has initially been suggested to be a low - mass c - o white dwarf @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of several type - i x - ray bursts detected from the source possibly indicates that the donor instead is a helium white dwarf @xcite . in any case to compare the donor to stellar models , we use the m - r relations for different types of white dwarfs provided by @xcite . because extremely low - mass white dwarf donors in ultracompact systems may be thermally bloated compared to cold stars , affecting their m - r relation @xcite",
    ", we show both cold and hot solutions for pure he , c , and o white dwarfs in figure  [ fig : mr ] . a helium white dwarf with a mass of 0.0340.039 @xmath4 and a radius of 0.0330.035 @xmath5 , or a c / o white dwarf with a mass of 0.0240.029 @xmath4 and a radius of 0.030.032",
    "@xmath5 can fit in the roche lobe - filling donor .",
    "modulation of an optical light curve for lmxbs generally arises from the companion star that is heated by the central x - ray source , with the visible area of the heated face varying as a function of orbital phase and the superior conjunction of the companion star corresponding to the observed brightness maximum of the light curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been realized that compact lmxbs with extreme mass ratios ( such as ultracompact binaries ) are potential superhump sources @xcite .",
    "the variation in the light curve of a superhump binary arises from an elliptical accretion disk , which is developed when the disk extends beyond the 3:1 resonance radius and precesses in the inertial frame due to the tidal force of a secondary star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . without an independent determination of the binary period ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we can not distinguish between the two possibilities for the modulation seen in 2s  0918@xmath0549 .",
    "a superhump modulation may have an asymmetric shape ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however in the current light curve we obtained , no asymmetry is clearly seen . in either case since superhump periods are only a few percent longer than the corresponding orbital periods , the orbital period of 2s  0918@xmath0549  is around 17.4 min .",
    "considering that the periodic modulation arises from the companion star , the inner face of the companion star in 2s  0918@xmath0549  is heated by x - ray emission from the central neutron star and its effective temperature can be estimated .",
    "the 0.1200 kev x - ray luminosity @xmath32 is 1.9@xmath33 erg s@xmath7 , where @xmath34 is the source distance assumed to be 5 kpc and the unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath35 erg s@xmath7 @xmath36 given by @xcite is used .",
    "the fraction @xmath37 of the x - ray energy absorbed by the companion is @xmath380.004@xmath39^{-2/3}$ ] , where @xmath40 is the fraction of the received x - ray energy absorbed by the companion , @xmath41 is the radius of the companion , and @xmath42 is the binary separation distance ( @xmath43 cm for orbital period @xmath44 min ) .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the neutron star mass and we assume @xmath47 and @xmath48 . following @xcite ,",
    "the effective temperature of the companion s inner face is @xmath49 k , where @xmath50 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the visible area of this hot face varies as a function of the orbital phase , yielding a modulation of @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath52 is the inclination angle of the binary ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "using such a modulation function , we can test how the observed modulation is generated .",
    "the extinction to the source @xmath53 , estimated from @xmath54  @xmath36 @xcite by using hydrogen column density to the source @xmath55 @xmath36 @xcite . by adding a constant flux component ( arising from the accretion disk ) to the modulation function and fitting the dereddend light curve of 2s  0918@xmath0549  with the modulation function",
    ", we find @xmath56 .",
    "the estimated low inclination angle is consistent with the non - detection of orbital signals at x - ray energies , which generally indicates @xmath57 ( @xcite ) , and likely explains the low - amplitude modulation in the light curve . in order to fully explore properties of the binary by fitting the optical modulation ,",
    "an advanced binary light curve model is needed ( e.g. , @xcite ; wang et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .        as a separate check",
    ", we also estimate the distance to 2s  0918@xmath0549 . mass transfer in ultracompact binaries is driven by gravitational radiation , and a mass transfer rate in 2s  0918@xmath0549",
    "can be estimated to be @xmath58 @xmath59 since @xmath60 , the unabsorbed 0.1200 kev x - ray flux of 2s  0918@xmath0549  would imply @xmath619 kpc , where conservative mass transfer onto a 1.4 @xmath4 neutron star is assumed and @xmath62 km is the neutron star radius .",
    "the distance value is larger than the 4.15.4 kpc range derived from type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "we note that @xmath63 is sensitive to @xmath64 .",
    "for example , if @xmath65 , where an oxygen white dwarf has to be assumed , the distance could be lowered to 7 kpc .",
