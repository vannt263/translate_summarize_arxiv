    "the central parts of our galaxy were prospected by baade ( 1946 ) , in order to detect its nucleus , and to have an indication of the morphological type of our galaxy .",
    "the so - called baade s window was revealed , and from variable stars identified in the field , the bulge stellar population was identified to be similar to that defined in baade ( 1944 ) as population ii . in the early 60s",
    "the notion of a galactic bulge was already established ( e.g. courtes & cruvellier 1960 ) .",
    "mcclure ( 1969 ) found that the bulge stars were super metal - rich compared to the stars nearby the sun .",
    "whitford and rich ( 1983 ) confirmed the high metal content of bulge stars from individual star spectroscopy .",
    "catalogues prepared along the decades show a steady growth of overall samples of globular clusters ( hereafter referred to as gcs ) , together with photometric and spectroscopic information . cannon ( 1929 ) used the harvard plate spectra to give integrated spectral types of 45 globular clusters .",
    "mayall ( 1946 ) measured radial velocities of 50 globular clusters , and the integrated spectral types of 40 of them . kinman ( 1959 ) listed 32 gcs with indication of metallicity from their integrated spectra ; morgan ( 1959 ) directed efforts on a relatively bright sample of 13 bulge gcs , now known to be metal - rich .",
    "surveys with schmidt plates since the 60s provided the palomar and eso star clusters , among others .",
    "terzan ( 1968 and references therein ) significantly increased the number of central gcs by reporting new faint ones in the bulge direction .",
    "these discoveries provided an important sample of gcs in the bulge .",
    "other studies of gc overall samples were presented by van den bergh ( 1967 ) , zinn ( 1985 and references therein ) , bica & pastoriza ( 1983 ) .",
    "webbink ( 1985 ) provided a catalogue of 154 gcs and candidates , with an important impact on subsequent observational efforts .",
    "more recently , harris ( 1996 , updated in 2010 , hereafter harris10 ) reports properties for 157 gcs .",
    "it is interesting to see how the notion of gcs pertaining to the bulge and their spatial distribution evolved in the last decades .",
    "frenk & white ( 1982 ) found evidence that metal - rich gcs formed a bar - like structure .",
    "based on metallicity , scale height , and rotational velocities available at that time , armandroff ( 1989 and references therein ) interpreted a sample of low galactic latitude metal - rich gcs as belonging to a disk system .",
    "minniti ( 1995 ) instead , from metallicity and kinematics of gcs in the central 3 kpc ( about 20@xmath1 ) from the galactic center , found evidence for these gcs to belong to the bulge .",
    "ct ( 1999 ) derived metallicities and radial velocities from high resolution spectroscopy for a significant sample of gcs within 4 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "he concluded that metal - rich gcs are associated with the bulge / bar rather than the thick disk .",
    "an important step in the understanding of the nature of the bulge gcs was presented by ortolani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , where the metal - rich gcs ngc 6528 and ngc 6553 were found to have an old age , identical to the bulk of the bulge field stars and comparable to that of the halo clusters .",
    "barbuy et al . (",
    "1998 ) derived new results and summarized the properties of 17 gcs in the bulge projected within 5@xmath1 of the galactic center .",
    "they concluded that these clusters shared comparable properties with the bulge field stars , including not only metal - rich gcs but also intermediate metallicity ones .",
    "they also found that there are no clusters in a strip 2.8@xmath1 wide centred at about 0.5@xmath1 south of the galactic plane .",
    "several comprehensive recent reviews have addressed the stellar populations , both field and gcs , in the galactic bulge ( e.g. harris 2001 ; rich 2013 ; gonzalez & gadotti 2015 ) .",
    "these reviews address also comparisons of the galactic bulge with external galaxies .    in the following",
    "we describe recent advances on detailed chemical abundances , distances , kinematical properties and hints on possible association with subsystems in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "we also prepare for the future by defining a bulge gc sample , which includes suggestions for future studies , in terms of unstudied objects .",
    "in particular it is clear that proper motion derivation is still needed for most gcs .",
    "in the past , angular distances from the galactic center were the basis for selecting bulge gcs in the central parts of the galaxy ( e.g. zinn 1985 ; barbuy et al .",
    "1998 ) .    as a first approach we selected clusters with angular distances below 20@xmath1 .",
    "our next step was to use the galactocentric distances of the clusters , given that now they are more reliable - see harris10 .",
    "we adopted a distance to the galactic center of 8 kpc ( bobylev et al .",
    "2014 ; reid et al .",
    "2014 ) . for selecting the clusters we have experimented different distances from the galactic center of 6 , 5 , 4 and 3 kpc .",
    "in each case , we checked for bulge clusters and halo intruders . we conclude that a cutoff of 3 kpc is best in terms of isolating a bona - fide bulge cluster sample , with little contamination .",

    "the use of this criterion is possible for about a third of the gcs , at the present stage .",
    "gaia results in a few years will bring higher precision , and new data for a number of gcs .",

    "we also report distances derived from the galactic center , as given by harris10 . for kronberger 49 , not listed in harris10 ,",
    "data are from ortolani et al .",
    "the distance derivation is crucial in order to get the position of the clusters relative to the galactic center and the bar . in most cases , for a cluster located inside the bar , its orbit is trapped , given the high mass of the bar . in fact",
    "more than half the bulge mass is in the bar , and for this reason , the bulge clusters that show low kinematics are trapped ( rossi et al .",
    "2015a ) . given the old age of the clusters it is likely that they were formed before the bar , and later trapped .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of such clusters was illustrated for hp  1 ( ortolani et al .",

    "subsamples are classified as follows :    \\a ) probable halo intruders with [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.5 : we found 6 gcs with distances to the galactic center smaller than 3 kpc ( our selected bulge volume ) , but with metallicity lower than [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.5 , and besides with very high spatial velocities ( dinescu et al . 1999a , 2010 ) , all pointing to perigalactic locations of halo gcs .",

    "( 2015 ) concluded that liller 1 is as massive as terzan 5 or @xmath4 centauri .",
    "these massive clusters have absolute magnitudes around m@xmath0@xmath5 - 10 .",
    "on the other hand , the faintest bulge gcs are as faint as m@xmath0@xmath5 - 4 , such as terzan 9 and al  3 .",
    "these magnitudes are comparable to those of the ultra - faint galaxies ( e.g. mcconnachie 2012 ; bechtol et al .",
    "2015 ) .    by multiple stellar populations we refer to different metallicities [ fe / h ] in a same cluster .",
    "for most clusters there are hints of two populations , but no difference in metallicity .",

    "see further discussions on multiple populations revealed by na - o anticorrelations in sect .",
    "since this effect appears to be present for most clusters , this is incorporated in the definition of globular clusters , and it is not a concern in the present work .",
    "distances of bulge gcs are mainly based on the horizontal branch ( hb ) luminosity level .",
    "the calculation of distances depends on 3 basic inputs : ( 1 ) the hb absolute magnitude , ( 2 ) the reddening , and ( 3 ) the reddening law .",
    "these three datasets slightly depend on the metallicity .",
    "the hb absolute magnitude may also depend on the he abundance .",
    "the current statistics is based mostly on the distances reported in harris10 , where the hb level is given by the relation : m(hb)=0.16[fe / h]+0.84 .",

    "it is also important to point out that the main difference between harris10 and barbuy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) values , is that the latter was based on optical cmds only .",
    "the list of distances also makes use of the jhk colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) when it is considered more reliable .",

    "( 2006 ) uses basically the same assumptions as harris10 .",
    "_ reddening and reddening law : _ the reddening is a key parameter in the derivation of the distances based on the photometric technique . for most of the low latitude bulge gcs ,",
    "an error of 5% in reddening produces a typical error of @xmath615% in the absorption , which propagates with the same fraction to the distance modulus . in harris10",
    "the reddening has been derived from webbink ( 1985 ) , zinn ( 1985 ) and reid et al .",

    "independent distances and reddening values have been obtained by valenti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for 37 bulge clusters , using infrared jhk photometry .",
    "the main advantage of the jhk derived distances is that the reddening vs. absorption ratio is almost constant even if r@xmath0 varies ( fitzpatrick 1999 ; cardelli et al .",
    "the comparison of the optical vs. ir distances give a chance to probe the reddening law , in the optical regime , in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the distance differences between different r@xmath0 values versus reddening .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the horizontal branch m(hb ) is assumed to be of m(hb)=0.68 for [ fe / h]=-1.0 , at e(b - v)=0 .",
    "therefore at the distance of the galactic center , assumed here to be of 8 kpc , the distance modulus is m - m=14.5 , and m(hb)=14.5 + 0.68=15.18 .",

    "( 2007 ) . at an average distance of 8 kpc ,",

    "conclusions from fig .",
    "2 are : a ) it is clear that the optical data produce shorter distances , in particular at high reddening ; b ) in order to get comparable infrared and optical distances , we have to adopt an average total - to - selective absorption r@xmath0=3.2 .",
    "this average value is slightly lower than that adopted in barbuy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) of r@xmath0=3.39 ( see their table 4 ) , but it is still higher than the standard r@xmath0=3.1 value , and it is in agreement with recent studies of the reddening law in different conditions of reddening , metallicity and intrinsic colours of the stars ( hendricks et al . 2012 ; mccall 2004 ) .",
    "a further test can be performed following racine & harris ( 1989 ) and barbuy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , plotting v(hb ) as a function of reddening .",
    "assuming that , on the average , the inner bulge clusters ( within 3 kpc from the galactic center ) are concentrated around this distance , the hb level should be related to the reddening by means of a slope r@xmath0 .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which is the updated version of fig . 5 in barbuy et al .",
    "this analysis includes 12 clusters plus an arbitrary point at e(b - v)=0 and v(hb)=15.18 , which should correspond to the v(hb ) at 8.0 kpc from the sun , with [ fe / h]=-1.0 , m@xmath0=0.8 , as explained above .",
    "therefore the best fit is 3.3 @xmath2 r@xmath0 @xmath23.1 .",
    "the higher slope of r@xmath0=3.6 seems too steep .",

    "in this review we provide a state - of - the - art list of bulge globular clusters and their properties .",
    "we tried to constrain their properties including their kinematics when available .",
    "kinematics is becoming a key tool to identify their nature , and the link with the field stellar populations , within the complex substructures of the bulge .    in recent years",
    "good progress in the knowledge of the globular clusters in the central parts of the galaxy has been achieved .",
    "for spectroscopy the multi - object spectrographs in 8m - class telescopes have made it possible to derive chemical abundances for considerable numbers of stars .",
    "progress in instrumentation thanks to e.g. imaging with mcao in the infrared ( mad / vlt , gems / gemini ) and hst / nicmos , made possible long time baseline of ccd data with excellent quality , allowing proper motion cleaning of cmds . finally , surveys with larger apertures such as the 4 m vista telescope , provided the discovery of new objects .",
    "the vvv survey in particular has provided several new bulge globular clusters and candidates , to be explored in coming years .",
    "much work is still needed as concerns bulge globular clusters , such as the monitoring of variable stars , in particular rr lyrae , to obtain deep cmds allowing age derivation , and the derivation of metallicities and chemical abundances from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the derivation of na and o abundances will be crucial to define if these very old clusters have a unique or multiple stellar generations .",
    "these results should allow to better compare the bulge globular clusters with outer bulge , inner halo and outer halo ones .",
