    "every observed classical matter field obeys certain _ energy conditions _ @xcite ; these constrain the local energy density of the field to be everywhere non - negative .",
    "the situation in quantum field theory is very different : it is well known that the energy density of a quantum field may have a negative expectation value at a point @xcite .",
    "although the classical energy conditions do not hold directly for quantum fields , the correspondence principle gives good reason to suppose that some analogous quantum energy conditions might be found .",
    "indeed , were this not the case , then the resultant ` exotic ' matter fields could potentially be used for a number of alarming subversions of physical law  these include large - scale violations of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite , the creation of traversable wormholes @xcite , and the potential for faster - than - light travel using ` warp drive ' technologies @xcite .",
    "fortunately , it transpires that quantum field theory does contain a mechanism that prevents unconstrained negative energy densities .",
    "this mechanism is made manifest in what shall be known as _ quantum inequalities _ or _ quantum weak energy inequalities _",
    "( qweis )  this latter description emphasizing the parallel with the weak energy condition of classical field theory .",
    "the derivation and study of qweis was initiated by ford and co - workers @xcite , culminating in a bound for the scalar field in static spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these early bounds were generalized in the work of fewster and collaborators @xcite , culminating in the most general result for the scalar field : a bound holding in any globally - hyperbolic spacetime @xcite .",
    "in addition to the scalar field , qweis have been found for the maxwell and proca fields ( both spin 1 ) ; the earliest results for spin 1 fields were given in @xcite , and later generalised in the findings of @xcite .",
    "qweis have also been obtained for the rarita - schwinger ( spin @xmath1 ) field @xcite .",
    "the fundamental object of study is the _ smeared energy density _ @xmath2",
    "; this is a weighted average of the energy density , defined as @xmath3 for convenience , and with no loss of generality , the real - valued _ smearing function _",
    "@xmath4 is assumed to have unit @xmath5 norm .",
    "a qwei is a state - independent lower bound on the expectation value of @xmath2 , and is said to be _ optimal _ if the lower bound is an infimum over the class of states which are ` physically meaningful ' in some appropriate sense . here",
    ", this class will consist of those states in the fock space of the minkowski vacuum for which the manipulations described are valid .",
    "although this class will not be explicitly delineated here , it is expected to include all states for which contributions from high momenta or high particle number are damped ( e.g. exponentially ) .",
    "the space of these ` physically meaningful ' states is dense in fock space .",
    "fully rigorous treatments of qweis , such as @xcite , do not need to fix a hilbert space representation and can consider the full class of hadamard states .",
    "flanagan @xcite gave the first optimal bound , for the _ massless _ scalar field in two - dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "vollick @xcite subsequently showed that flanagan s bound also applies to , and is optimal for , massless dirac fields on two - dimensional flat spacetime  this was the first quantum inequality for the dirac field .",
    "vollick s bound holds only for static observers in static spacetimes ; flanagan @xcite succeeded in removing this restriction .",
    "in minkowski spacetime , the flanagan - vollick bound has the form @xmath6 where @xmath2 is defined by ( [ definition of t_f ] ) .",
    "the arguments used to derive this optimal bound rely heavily on certain conformal properties of massless fields in two dimensions , and do not generalize directly to non - zero masses or higher - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "a general treatment of two - dimensional conformal field theories has been given in @xcite ; this work makes the important generalization to the case of interacting field theories .",
    "fewster and verch @xcite have shown that a bound exists for the dirac field in any four - dimensional globally - hyperbolic spacetime ; however , this bound is not given by an explicit formula .",
    "fewster and mistry @xcite have given the first explicit , closed - form bound on the smeared energy density of a dirac field on four - dimensional flat spacetime . here , their argument ( which requires only the anticommutation relations and a certain identity for fourier transforms ) is adapted to the case of two - dimensional flat spacetime , leading to the bound @xmath7 here , @xmath0 is the field mass , and @xmath8 like the four - dimensional bound of @xcite ( and in contrast to that of @xcite ) , the bound given here is explicit , and in closed - form .",
    "the bound is easily seen to be non - optimal by consideration of the massless limit ; here , the present bound is weaker by a factor of 3 than the flanagan - vollick optimal bound .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , although it is not optimal , the present bound does apply to the case @xmath9 ; the flanagan - vollick bound , in contrast , holds strictly for the special case of zero mass .",
    "let spacetime be flat and two - dimensional , and let the metric signature be @xmath10 . then , choosing a system of units in which @xmath11 , a fermion field @xmath12 of mass @xmath0 satisfies the dirac equation @xmath13 the @xmath14 matrices @xmath15 obey @xmath16 the field @xmath12 is a two - component spinor . in the sequel , spinor indices",
    "will often be suppressed : @xmath12 itself is a notational shorthand for @xmath17 a good example of the suppression of spinor indices is provided by the spinor product @xmath18 ; written out fully , this is @xmath19    for calculational simplicity , the field will be quantized in a one - dimensional ` box ' of side length @xmath20 ; the continuum limit @xmath21 will be taken later .",
    "the field operator @xmath12 can be expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators as @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , and the mode energy @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 the basis spinors @xmath26 and @xmath27 obey periodic boundary conditions on @xmath28 $ ] , as a consequence of the ` box ' quantization . additionally , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed to be normalized so that @xmath29 this choice of normalization ensures that both @xmath30 and @xmath31 have unit @xmath32 norm on @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators obey the anticommutation relations @xmath33 and @xmath34 all other anticommutators of creation and annihilation operators vanish identically .",
    "the energy density of the quantized field is obtained by substitution of the mode expansion ( [ mode expansion ] ) into the classical expression @xmath35\\ ] ] for the energy density .",
    "the result , evaluated at the spatial origin @xmath36 , is @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\      { } +      \\left(\\omega_{k^\\prime}-\\omega_k\\right)\\left [        d_kb_{k^\\prime}v^\\ast_ku_{k^\\prime}\\rme^{-\\rmi\\left(\\omega_k+\\omega_{k^\\prime}\\right)t }        -b^\\ast_kd^\\ast_{k^\\prime}u^\\ast_kv_{k^\\prime}\\rme^{+\\rmi\\left(\\omega_k+\\omega_{k^\\prime}\\right)t }      \\right ]    \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normal - ordered operator has been given , making use of the rule @xmath38    it will have been noticed that the spinors @xmath26 and @xmath27 appearing in the mode expansion ( [ mode expansion ] ) carry labels for the mode momentum only .",
    "this is in contrast to the familiar four - dimensional case , where the corresponding basis spinors are often written @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with the index @xmath41 labelling the two independent spin states .",
    "spin is essentially trivial in two dimensions @xcite , and so a spin index is not required .",
    "writing @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is real - valued and has unit @xmath5 norm , the smeared energy density measured by an observer static at the spatial origin is the expectation value of @xmath44 ( the translational invariance of the theory will be employed later , to remove the specialization to the spatial origin . ) what is required is a lower bound on the spectrum of @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ energy density at spatial origin ] ) gives @xmath46 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\fl & { } +      \\left(\\omega_{k^\\prime}-\\omega_k\\right)\\left [        d_kb_{k^\\prime}v^\\ast_ku_{k^\\prime}\\widehat{f}\\left(\\omega_k+\\omega_{k^\\prime}\\right )        -b^\\ast_kd^\\ast_{k^\\prime}u^\\ast_kv_{k^\\prime}\\widehat{f}\\left(-\\omega_k-\\omega_{k^\\prime}\\right )      \\right ]    \\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fourier transform @xmath47 of a function @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49    the first step in the derivation is the definition of a family of spinorial fock space operators : @xmath50 ( here , in order to avoid confusion with the continuous parameter index @xmath51 , the spinor index @xmath52 is shown explicitly . )",
    "the derivation now proceeds very much as in @xcite : the technique is to rewrite @xmath45 in terms of integrals of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , plus a multiple of the identity which emerges from the canonical anticommutation relations .",
    "specifically @xmath55 where the term @xmath56 arises from putting the individual operator products into normal order , using ( [ anticommutation relations 2 ] ) . discarding the terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 which contribute positively to @xmath45 , and combining the remaining integrals",
    ", the result is the state - independent lower bound @xmath57    plot of the function @xmath58 .",
    "notice the asymptotic behaviour @xmath59 . ]",
    "it remains to calculate the right - hand side of ( [ the basic bound ] ) , and to show that it is finite .",
    "substituting from the definition ( [ defn of s ] ) of @xmath60 , and taking the continuum limit @xmath61 the final bound is found to be @xmath62 where the function @xmath58 is defined by ( [ definition of q_1^d ] ) .",
    "a graph of @xmath58 is shown in figure [ graph of q1 ] ; its qualitative similarity to the @xmath63 of @xcite is easily seen .",
    "the scalar field analogue of @xmath58 is defined @xcite by @xmath64 this is related to @xmath58 by the identity @xmath65    finally , invoking the translational invariance of the theory , the bound can be generalized to the worldline @xmath66 of any stationary observer ; this gives @xmath67 it only remains to show that the bound is finite ( since it would otherwise be vacuous ) . because @xmath4 , it follows that @xmath68 decays faster than any inverse polynomial in @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "but @xmath71 grows like @xmath72 for large @xmath69 , and so the bound is finite .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour @xmath59 leads immediately to the massless qwei in the form @xmath73 again following the method of @xcite , the massless qwei is cast into its final form : @xmath74    this massless bound is weaker by a factor of 3 than vollick s optimal bound @xcite .",
    "when techniques analogous to those used here are applied to the scalar field , as in @xcite , they lead to a massless bound that overestimates the optimal bound of flanagan @xcite by a factor of @xmath75 . as was mentioned earlier , the essential difference between the present work and the derivation of the scalar field qweis of @xcite is that the latter use the convolution theorem in an essential way ; here , this is replaced by a different identity for fourier transforms  specifically , ( 2.17 ) of @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that this difference accounts for the ` extra ' factor of two found here . in any case : while the bound ( [ the final bound ] ) is not optimal , it does have the same order of magnitude as the optimal bound , in the massless limit .",
    "it is worth remarking that ( [ zero mass limit ] ) holds also for dirac fields with non - zero mass ; because @xmath58 is bounded between 0 and 1 ( see figure [ graph of q1 ] ) , the qwei is at its least restrictive in the zero - mass limit .",
    "an explicit lower bound has been derived , constraining the smeared energy density of the dirac field in flat two - dimensional spacetime . unlike the earlier , optimal bound of flanagan and vollick , the bound holds for all ( non - negative ) values of the field mass @xmath0 . in the massless limit ,",
    "comparison with the flanagan - vollick optimal bound revealed that the bound given here overestimates the optimal bound by a factor of 3 .",
    "it seems reasonable to presume that the general method employed here can be extended to non - flat spacetimes ; this is indeed the case , and the results of this generalization will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the author wishes to thank christopher fewster , for his insightful contributions to our many discussions of negative energy densities .",
