    "neutron stars provide a natural laboratory to study extremely dense matter . in the interiors of such stars ,",
    "the density can reach up to several times the nuclear saturation density , @xmath8 . at such high densities quarks",
    "could be squeezed out of nucleons to form quark matter  @xcite .",
    "the true ground state of dense quark matter at high densities and low temperatures remains an open problem due to the difficulty of solving non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it has been suggested that strange quark matter that consists of comparable numbers of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 quarks may be the stable ground state of normal quark matter  @xcite .",
    "this led to the conjecture that the family of compact stars may have members consisting entirely of quark matter ( so - called strange stars ) and/or members featuring quark cores surrounded by a hadronic shell ( hybrid stars )  @xcite .",
    "observationally , it is very challenging to distinguish the various types of compact objects , such as the strange stars , hybrid stars , and ordinary neutron stars .",
    "their early cooling behavior is dominated by neutrino emission which is a useful probe of the internal composition of compact stars .",
    "thus , cooling simulations provide an effective test of the nature of compact stars  @xcite .",
    "however , many theoretical uncertainties and the current amount of data on the surface temperatures of neutron stars leave sufficient room for speculations  @xcite .",
    "another useful avenue for testing the internal structure and composition of compact stars is astro - seismology , i.e. , the study of the phenomena related to stellar vibrations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a number of instabilities which are associated with the oscillations of rotating stars . here",
    "we will be concerned with the so - called r - mode instability [ see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ] .",
    "this instability is known to limit the angular velocity of rapidly rotating compact stars .",
    "the r - mode and related instabilities in rotating neutron stars are damped by the shear and bulk viscosities of matter , therefore these are important ingredients of theoretically modelling rapidly rotating stars .",
    "such models and their microscopic input can then be constrained via the observations of rapidly rotating pulsars , such as the crab pulsar and the millisecond pulsars .    for quark matter in chemical equilibrium , the shear viscosity is dominated by strong interactions between quarks . the bulk viscosity , however , is dominated by flavor - changing weak processes , whereas strong interactions play a secondary role . for normal ( non - superconducting ) strange quark",
    "matter , the bulk viscosity is dominated by the non - leptonic process  @xcite    @xmath12    @xmath13    since the contributions of the leptonic processes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are suppressed due to much smaller phase spaces .",
    "the bulk viscosity of various phases of quark matter has been studied extensively , see refs .",

    "compact stars are strongly magnetized .",
    "neutron star observations indicate that the magnetic field is of the order of @xmath16 g at the surface of ordinary pulsars .",
    "magnetars - strongly magnetized neutron stars - may feature even stronger magnetic fields of the order of @xmath17 g  @xcite .",
    "an upper limit on the magnetic field can be set through the virial theorem .",
    "gravitational equilibrium of stars is compatible with magnetic fields of the order of @xmath18  g  @xcite .",
    "in such a strong magnetic field , not only the thermodynamical but also the hydrodynamical properties of stellar matter will be significantly affected . in particular , due to the large magnetization of strange quark matter the fluid will be strongly anisotropic in a strong magnetic field ( we note here that the magnetization of ordinary neutron matter is small  @xcite ) . therefore , there is need to develop an anisotropic hydrodynamic theory to describe strongly magnetized matter in compact stars .",
    "as we show below , the matter is completely described in terms of eight viscosity coefficients , which include six shear viscosities and two bulk viscosities .    in this paper",
    ", we will carry out a theoretical study of the anisotropic hydrodynamics of magnetized strange quark matter and will calculate the two bulk viscosities .",
    "we will also discuss the implications of the anisotropic bulk viscosities on the r - mode instability in rotating quark stars .",

    "in this paper we have studied anisotropic hydrodynamics of strongly magnetized matter in compact stars .",
    "we find that there are in general eight viscosity coefficients , six of them are identified as shear viscosities , the other two , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are bulk viscosities [ see eq .",
    "( [ pmn ] ) ] .",
    "we applied our formalism to magnetized strange quark matter and gave explicit expressions for the bulk viscosities [ eq .  ( [ vis1 ] ) and eq .  ( [ vis2 ] ) ] due to the non - leptonic weak reactions ( [ weak1 ] ) and ( [ weak2 ] ) . due to the landau quantization of the energy levels of charged particles in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetic field dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is very complicated and exhibits  quasi - periodic \" de haas - van alphen type oscillations ( see fig .",
    "[ zeta_u ] ) . for a magnetic field",
    "@xmath434  g the effect of the magnetic field on the transport coefficients is small and the bulk viscosities can be well approximated by their zero - field values . for large fields",
    "@xmath435  g the viscosities are substantially modified , @xmath0 may even become negative for some values of the @xmath2-field .",
    "we showed that negative @xmath0 render the fluid hydrodynamically unstable .    for a number of reasons ( density dependence of parameters along the star profile , formation of domains , intrinsic multicomponent nature of the magnetic field ) the dependence of the transport coefficients on the magnetic fields",
    "are needed at different resolutions , _",
    "i.e. _ , they require some suitable averaging over a range of magnetic field . we have provided such averages over an increasingly larger scale .",
    "we find that if the averaging period is small the bulk viscosities show regular oscillations , the amplitudes of which increase with magnetic field ( see the black solid curves in fig .",
    "[ zetaaver ] ) .",
    "these oscillations are smoothed out if we further increase the averaging scale . at this larger scale",
    "the most interesting feature is the rapid drop in the bulk viscosity of the matter due to the confinement of quarks to the lowest landau level ; this occurs for magnetic fields in excess of @xmath436 g ( see the short - dashed red curves in fig .  [ zetaaver ] ) .    as an application",
    ", we utilized our computed anisotropic bulk viscosities to study the problem of damping of r - mode oscillations in rotating newtonian stars .",
    "we find that the instability window increases as the magnetic field is increased above the value @xmath437 g. by increasing the field one covers the entire range of parameter space which lies between the two extremes : the case when bulk viscosity vanishes ( dashed green curve in fig .",
    "[ rmode ] , which corresponds to extremely large magnetic fields @xmath438 g for which the bulk viscosity drops to zero ) , and the case when the magnetic field is absent ( solid black curve in fig .  [ rmode ] ) .",
    "the found novel dependence of the r - mode instability window on the magnetic field may help to distinguish quark stars from ordinary neutron stars with strong magnetic fields , since the latter are much more difficult to magnetize .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the objects that lie in between these extremes , _ e.g. _ , hybrid configurations featuring quark cores and hadronic envelopes  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , may interpolate smoothly between the physics of ordinary and strange compact objects .",

    "firstly , it is easy to see that the components @xmath442 and @xmath443 are independent of the other components , because they have odd parity under reflection @xmath444 , whereas the other six components have even parity under this transformation . besides that it is obvious that @xmath445 and @xmath443 are independent of each other .",
