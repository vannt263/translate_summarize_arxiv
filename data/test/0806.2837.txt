    "these investigators believe that the stretching transforms b - dna , which is dna in its natural state , to a new , extended state , named s - dna .",
    "modeling studies and simulations were carried out to characterize this putative new state of dna.@xcite subsequently , storm and nelson  @xcite proposed a statistical model of dna as a discrete persistent chain ( dpc ) with two monomer flavors of different lengths and stiffnesses , and fit their parameters successfully to experimental data .",
    "however , williams , rouzina , bloomfield , and co - workers have argued on the basis of their own experiments that s - dna is not a new state of the molecule , but merely dna that is melted to two single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) fragments.@xcite furthermore , they deem the aforementioned modeling and simulations of s - dna as contradicting experimental data . furthering this controversy , cocco et al.@xcite reexamine the experimental data and argue in favor of s - dna , whitelam et al.@xcite do so based on kinetics , while piana  @xcite observes melting in simulations of short stretches of dna .    in 1966",

' to make the model analytically tractable , certain features of dna such as excluded volume , bending rigidity , and sequence inhomogeneity are typically left out . with the later inclusion of excluded volume effects , the model is well suited for characterizing the nature of the melting transition , and its universality . for comprehensive ( but older ) reviews see refs .",

    "the effect of bending rigidity is still left out in the newer studies , making comparisons to experiment questionable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to facilitate the ongoing debate by providing a model that accounts for the bending rigidity of the polymer ( while leaving out excluded volume effects ) .    while we hope that our results and phase diagrams provide an additional perspective into this system , our main accomplishment is the extension of the transfer matrix method used for a single persistent polymer ( worm - like chain ) to the melting of a double - stranded polymer .",

    "the coupling @xmath3 parameterizes the cost of bending neighboring monomers .",

    "the lowest curve in the top figure ( red in the online version ) corresponds to no bending in the bubble or vertex ; @xmath107 .",

    "several features of these phase diagrams are now commented on in more detail .      with our choice of parameters , increasing the value of any stiffness parameter @xmath109 , makes the corresponding segment ( or joint ) more favorable .",
    "this is because the corresponding boltzmann weights are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath109 ( as are the modified spherical bessel functions @xmath110 ) .",
    "for example , for a bubble segment the overall weight increases with @xmath111 , despite the fact that there are fewer configurations ( and hence reduced ) entropy for the stiffened and stretched bubble .",
    "these trends are further magnified at larger force as the stretched segments gain even more weight by aligning to the force , as can be easily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetrans ] .      an interesting feature of the phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetrans ] is its _ reentrance _ , namely for certain choices of @xmath15 ( @xmath112 )",
    "the mixed r - b phase is stable at intermediate values of the force , but melts at both weak and strong force .",
    "this reentrance is also present in another model of denaturation which incorporates excluded volume effects in the bubbles , but no bending rigidity  @xcite .",
    "this feature can be explained by examining the limiting behaviors of the phase boundary at small and large @xmath98 . for large @xmath98 , the polymer ( whether in native or denatured state ) is stretched along the direction of the force .",
    "the contribution from entropy is relatively small in this limit , and one can estimate the location of the phase boundary by comparison of energies : the energy of a fully stretched rod segment is @xmath113 per base - pair . if the two strands are separated the energy changes to @xmath114 .",
    "the transition occurs for @xmath115 , which has a positive slope since b  strands have longer monomers and are favored by the force .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : phasetransslope ] , this argument can be made more rigorous and extended to all cases where the contribution from the joints can be ignored . in such cases",
    "the slope of the phase boundary is given by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 denotes the average length per monomer , calculated for each segment type ( b  segment or r  segment ) treated separately .    at zero force ,",
    "the _ average _ end - to - end extension of each segment , @xmath118 , is zero by symmetry .",
    "the extension for small @xmath98 is linear , with a force constant ( susceptibility ) that is easily related to the _ variance _ of the end - to - end extension at @xmath119 .",
    "since the change in free energy is proportional to @xmath120 , the phase boundary is also quadratic in this limit . in the absence of joint stiffness",
    ", the curvature of the transition line can be related to the difference in susceptibilities by @xmath121 , see appendix  [ app : phasetransslope ] for a derivation . here , @xmath122 denotes the variance in length of rods or bubbles per monomer , computed for one rod segment or one bubble segment subject to the same fugacity and force as for the whole molecule .",
    "since it is easier to rotate and align the more rigid r  segments in the direction of the force , their gain from the force is larger , and small force favors the native double - stranded phase .",
    "the reentrance in the phase diagram of reference  @xcite , mentioned in the first paragraph of this subsection , can be explained with these expressions as well . in this paper different behaviors",
    "are obtained as a function of a parameter @xmath123 , which determines how statistically favored joints are .",
    "they observe a reentrant phase diagram for @xmath124 ( disfavoring joints ) but not for @xmath125 ( many joints ) .",
    "the variance per monomer in the lengths of the bubbles is roughly constant ( @xmath126 as in a random walk ) , but for stiff rods the variance grows as the average size ( @xmath127 as in a directed walk ) . for small @xmath123 ,",
    "there are few joints and longer rods just after the phase transition into the mixed bubble  rod phase , making the variance per monomer large .",
    "according to the above formula for @xmath128 this leads to reentrance . note that excluded volume effects",
    "do not substantially modify this argument .",
    "williams et al . experimentally observe ( figure  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) a reentrance in the phase boundary when they fit their data to a simple model . unfortunately ,",
