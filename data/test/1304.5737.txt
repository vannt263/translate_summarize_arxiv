    "phenomenological studies on extra dimensions involving quark - quark , gluon - gluon or quark - gluon collisions at the lhc are widespread in the literature . on the other hand ,",
    "extra dimensions have been much less studied in photon - induced reactions ( @xmath3 or @xmath4-proton collisions ) at the lhc .    in an usual proton - proton deep inelastic scattering ( dis )",

    "whereas in @xmath4-proton processes one of the incoming protons dissociates into partons but other proton remains intact .",
    "midway from proton - proton dis to @xmath3 , @xmath4-proton processes have less experimental uncertainties compared with proton - proton processes .",
    "furthermore , they have higher energy reach and effective luminosity with respect to @xmath3 processes @xcite .",
    "in this work we have investigated tev scale effects of extra spatial dimensions via the process @xmath0 at the lhc .",
    "the process @xmath0 takes part as a subprocess in the main reaction @xmath5",
    "( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the photon which enters the subprocess is emitted from one of the proton beams and described by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite . in the framework of epa , virtuality of the quasireal photons",
    "is very low .",
    "hence when a proton emits a quasireal photon , it does not dissociate into partons . in epa ,",
    "quasireal photons carry a small transverse momentum .",
    "therefore photon emitting intact protons deviate slightly from their trajectory along the beam path .",
    "they are generally scattered with very small angles from the beam pipe and exit the central detector without being detected .",
    "consequently , detection of intact protons needs forward detector equipment in addition to central detectors .",
    "it is foreseen to equip atlas and cms central detectors with very forward detectors which can detect intact scattered protons with a very large pseudorapidity .",
    "a project called afp ( atlas forward physics ) that aims to install very forward detectors located at distances 220 and 420 m from the interaction point , is under evaluation in the atlas collaboration @xcite .",

    "mathematically speaking , it is defined by the formula @xmath8 . here",

    "when forward detectors are placed closer to the interaction point they can detect protons with higher @xmath7 . in the cms - totem forward detector scenario , a forward detector acceptance of @xmath14",
    "is considered @xcite .",
    "this wide acceptance range is provided by the use of the detectors of totem experiment at 147 and 220 m from the cms interaction point in addition to forward detectors at 420 m.    existence of photon - induced reactions in a hadron collider is not merely a theoretical hypothesis .",
    "photon - induced reactions in a hadron - hadron collision were verified experimentally at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",

    "the hierarchy is eliminated by choosing the compactification radius large .",

    "spin-2 and spin-0 states are sometimes called kk - gravitons and gravitational scalars respectively .",
    "kk - gravitons couple to the energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields .",
    "although their coupling to sm fields is suppressed by a factor proportional to @xmath34 , summation of enormous number of kk states in a tower provides an effective coupling of order @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , kk - gravitons can have observable effects at the tev scale .",
    "gravitational scalars are coupled only to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",

    "the first two are the afp and cms - totem acceptances as we have mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the last two are the subintervals of the whole afp and cms - totem acceptance regions .",
    "forward detectors have a capability to detect intact protons in a continuous range of momentum fraction loss @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we can impose cuts and choose to work in a subinterval of the whole acceptance region .",
    "since the kk terms in the amplitude square have a higher momentum dependence than the sm terms , imposing such cuts and removing low energy region of the whole acceptance range considerably suppress the sm contribution without minimizing the kk effects .    in fig.[fig3",
    "] we present 95% c.l .",
    "lower bounds for @xmath52 as a function of integrated lhc luminosity for afp and cms - totem acceptances . at the lhc energies ,",
    "deep inelastic scattering processes generally have a very high virtuality .",
    "due to bjorken scaling it is expected that quark distribution functions do not depend significantly on @xmath75 but only on @xmath76 .",
    "hence , during numerical calculations a fix @xmath75 value can be used .",
    "bjorken scaling is , however , not exact .",
    "for this reason , the bounds have been obtained by considering three different virtualities @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the deep inelastic scattering where @xmath79 is the mass of the z boson . here",
    ", @xmath79 represents only a scale which is roughly at the order of standard model energies .",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 are plausible scales for our process .",
    "for instance , if the center - of - mass energy of the subprocess @xmath0 is @xmath82 gev and outgoing photon is scattered with an angle of @xmath83 degree at the center - of - mass system of the incoming photon and quark then the square of the momentum transferred to the proton is @xmath84 .",
    "similarly for @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 gev , the corresponding momentum squares are @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively . in the laboratory system , incoming photon and quark do not have fix energies . instead , their energies are described by photon and quark distributions .",
    "if we assume that center - of - mass energy of the proton - proton system is @xmath89 tev and upper bound for the forward detector acceptance is 0.5 ( 0.15 ) then the center - of - mass energy of the subprocess extends up to energies of approximately 9900 gev ( 5422 gev ) .",
    "hence , it is probable for our subprocess to possesses a virtuality of @xmath77 or @xmath78 .    in fig.[fig4 ] we present the lower bounds for @xmath73 and @xmath74 subintervals of the whole afp and cms - totem acceptances .",
    "we see from these figures that the bounds for @xmath73 and @xmath74 cases are approximately 2 times stronger than the bounds for @xmath6 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "we have exhibited in fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] that limits vary a little with @xmath75 . but",
    "the variation in limits is minor . to be precise , we see from the left panel of fig.[fig3 ] that limits vary approximately by a factor of 1.06 when the square root of the virtuality @xmath90 varies by a factor of 10 .",
    "( or equivalently , virtuality @xmath75 varies by a factor of 100 . )",
    "although the add model eliminates the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the planck scale , it introduces a new hierarchy between the electroweak scale and @xmath91 . in this respect ,",
    "rs model solves the hierarchy problem without generating another large hierarchy . in the simplest rs model",
    ", we have only one extra spatial dimension and two branes located at orbifold fixed points @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath94 represents the extra dimensional coordinate and @xmath95 is the compactification radius of the extra dimension .",
    "the brane which is located at @xmath93 is called the tev - brane where sm fields live on .",
    "the brane at @xmath92 is called the planck - brane . as in the case of",
    "add model , gravity can propagate to everywhere .",
    "tev and planck branes have different vacuum energies and the 5 dimensional bulk bounded by these branes has a cosmological constant @xmath96 . assuming four dimensional poincare invariance , the solution to einstein s field equations is given by the following metric @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant of order the planck scale .",
    "it is also deduced from the solution of einstein s field equations that tev and planck branes have equal magnitude but opposite sign tensions and @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the spacetime in between tev and planck branes is a slice of an @xmath100 geometry . inserting metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) into the action for the gravity and integrating over extra dimensional coordinate @xmath94 , we obtain the following relation between the planck scale and the fundamental scale : @xmath101 if @xmath102 and @xmath103 is very small then the hierarchy between @xmath104 and @xmath105 is eliminated . from the action for matter fields we can deduce that any mass scale @xmath106 on the tev brane in the higher dimensional theory will correspond to a physical mass @xmath107 .",
    "the factor @xmath108 is called warp factor . if @xmath109 then the warp factor is small enough to generate tev scale masses from the masses of order @xmath110 .",
    "hence , rs model solves the hierarchy problem without generating a large hierarchy between @xmath98 and @xmath111 .    in the rs model ,",
    "kk graviton mass spacing is quite large compared with the add model .",
    "the mass spectrum is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the roots of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "therefore the mass spacing is at the order of tev scale .",
    "summation in the graviton propagator can not be approximated to an integral .",
    "instead , discrete graviton mass spectrum should be considered in the summation .",
    "since the contribution of the kk graviton excitations to the propagator is small for masses above the center - of - mass energy of the process , we can cut off the series at some finite mass value . during calculations ,",
    "we have considered first four roots of the bessel function .",
    "another important feature of the rs model is that massive kk graviton excitations couple to sm fields with a coupling constant @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a scale of the order of tev .",
    "amplitude square for the process @xmath0 in the rs model can be easily obtained from ( [ amplitudekk ] ) and ( [ amplitudeint ] ) through the replacement @xcite : @xmath118 where the decay width for the nth kk graviton excitation is @xmath119 . here",
    ", @xmath120 is a constant which is assumed to be 1 .",
    "we have obtained 95% c.l . excluded regions in the @xmath121 plane using a similar statistical analysis that was performed for the add model . here , @xmath122 is the mass of the first kk graviton excitation , i.e. , @xmath123 .",
    "we present our results in fig.[fig5 ] for two different forward detector acceptances @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the limits for the whole afp and cms - totem acceptance regions are weaker than the limits for @xmath73 and @xmath74 subintervals .",
    "hence , we do not present them . in the add model",
    "we have examined the validity of bjorken scaling by considering three different virtuality values .",
    "we have showed that although the bjorken scaling is not strictly valid , the limits vary a little with @xmath75 .",
    "we expect the same behavior in the rs model case since we have used the same distribution functions .",
    "therefore , we present our limits only for @xmath124 .",
    "the potential of @xmath3 processes at the lhc to probe large and warped extra dimensions was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite by some of the authors of this work . in these earlier papers",
    "the processes @xmath125 @xcite , @xmath126 @xcite and @xmath127 @xcite were considered and the bounds on model parameters of add and rs models were obtained . in our present paper we have probed the large and warped extra dimensions via @xmath0 subprocess in a _",
    "quasireal photon - proton _ deep inelastic scattering at the lhc . in the case of",
    "add model , the bounds that we have obtained for the @xmath0 subprocess are better than the bounds obtained in our earlier papers .",
    "for instance , in the acceptance region of @xmath74 and @xmath128 the lower bounds on the cutoff scale @xmath52 for the subprocesses @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are 3500 gev , 5100 gev and 2700 gev respectively . on the other hand , same bound for @xmath132 subprocess",
    "exceeds 6000 gev . in the case of rs model ,",
    "excluded region of the model parameters extends to wider regions than the case of the subprocesses @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "when we compare our present bounds with the bounds obtained from the subprocess @xmath135 , we see that our present bounds are little better than the bounds from @xmath136 .",
    "but the difference in bounds is minor especially for low @xmath137 values .",
    "for instance , @xmath138 c.l .",
    "lower bounds on the mass of the kk graviton obtained from the subprocess @xmath136 are 910 gev and 1350 gev for @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively . here , the forward detector acceptance is taken to be @xmath74 and @xmath141",
    ". the same bounds for @xmath132 subprocess are 965 gev and 1466 gev for @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "hence , we can say that the bounds obtained from the subprocess @xmath0 are comparable to those obtained from @xmath136 .",
    "the reason why the subprocess @xmath0 provides more stringent bounds than the above @xmath3 processes , is a consequence of a fact related to quark and photon distributions . in general ,",
    "quark distribution functions are bigger in magnitude than equivalent photon distribution functions , i.e. , in a proton the probability to find a quark with a bjorken parameter @xmath76 is higher than the probability of a quasireal photon with same momentum fraction @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , @xmath4-quark processes have higher effective luminosity than @xmath3 processes .",
    "furthermore , although both quark and quasireal photon distributions decrease as the @xmath76 parameter increases , this behavior is drastic in the quasireal photon case .",
    "thus , quarks in general carry more of the proton s energy than quasireal photons . hence , @xmath4-quark processes have higher energy reach than @xmath3 processes . due to above reasons",
    ", we expect that @xmath4-quark processes have a higher potential in probing new physics compared with @xmath3 processes .",
    "the subprocess @xmath0 in the @xmath4-proton collision seems to have lower potential in probing rs model than add model of extra dimensions .",
    "the reason for this feature is related to the fact that kk graviton contributions in @xmath0 take part only in a t - channel exchange diagram .",
    "a detailed explanation can be given as follows : in the add model , graviton mass spacing in a kk tower is very narrow .",
    "hence , it is assumed that the mass of the kk states is continuously distributed .",
    "it is impossible to see the effect of an individual add graviton but their cumulative effect might be observable . on the other hand , in the rs model kk graviton mass spacing is quite large , @xmath142 . at the lhc energies we hope to discover the first kk excitation which has a mass of order 1 tev . due to this discrete mass structure of rs gravitons resonance effects",
    "are important in the rs model but they are absent in the case of add model .",
    "it is obvious that resonance effects are not observed in u or t - channel exchange diagrams .",
    "instead , they appear in processes including s - channel graviton exchange diagrams . for this reason ,",
    "our bounds on rs model parameters are only slightly better than the bounds from @xmath136 although @xmath4-quark processes have higher energy reach and effective luminosity with respect to @xmath3 processes .",
    "recent results on large and warped extra dimensions from cms and atlas experiments provide stringent limits @xcite . in the case of",
    "add model , our limits on @xmath52 for an acceptance of @xmath74 are better than these current experimental bounds .",
    "however , our limits on rs model parameters are weaker than the recent experimental bounds @xcite",
