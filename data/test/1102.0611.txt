    "<S> astrometric observations of the radio source occultations by solar system bodies may be of large interest for testing gravity theories , dynamical astronomy , and planetary physics . in this paper , we present an updated list of the occultations of astrometric radio sources by planets expected in the nearest years . such events , like the solar eclipses , generally speaking , can be only observed in a limited region . </S>",
    "<S> the map of the shadow path is provided for the events occurred in regions with several vlbi stations and hence the most interesting for radio astronomy experiments . </S>"
