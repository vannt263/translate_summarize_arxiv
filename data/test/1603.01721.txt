    "extrasolar planets with structural properties similar to jupiter , orbiting at close separations from their host stars ( @xmath7 au , @xmath8 days ) are known as hot jupiters .",
    "nowadays , @xmath9250 transiting hot jupiters have been discovered , mostly thanks to the existence of dedicated ground - based photometric surveys like hatnet @xcite , superwasp @xcite and hatsouth @xcite .",
    "the brightness of the host stars of the majority of these transiting planets , coupled with the relatively strong observational signatures ( e.g. transit depth , radial velocity semi - amplitude ) have allowed the determination of both , the radii and the masses of most of the discovered transiting hot jupiters , which has been used to directly compute their bulk densities . moreover , by comparing this information with theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inner structure and composition of these planets can be inferred .",
    "in addition to the estimation of the physical parameters , if the hosts stars are bright enough , the execution of detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations on these systems permit to characterize their atmospheric structure and composition via transmission spectroscopy and/or secondary eclipses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; to refine the geometry of the orbit via the measurement of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite ; and to discover additional planetary companions by performing long term rv monitoring ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ttv analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or searching for additional transits in the light curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even though hot jupiters are arguably the most characterized type of extrasolar planet , there are several theoretical problems about their existence that remain to be solved .",
    "for example , there is no consensus about how these massive planets reached their current short orbital semi - major axes . in situ formation",
    "has proven to be unlikely @xcite , but the current observational evidence is not able to discriminate between gentle migration by gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk @xcite and high eccentricity migration mechanisms@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass and radius determination of transiting hot jupiters have revealed a wide diversity regarding their internal structure . in particular , an important fraction of these systems present radii that are too large to be explained with current theoretical models of planetary structure ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inflated radii of these planets has been shown to be correlated with the degree of insolation from their parent stars @xcite , but the main responsible mechanism is still unknown .    the detection of more hot jupiters , particularly those transiting bright stars , can be used to test theories about their structure and evolution .",
    "we report the discovery of two new systems by using data from the two - wheeled _ kepler _ k2 mission .",
    "unlike the original _ kepler _ mission , k2 is currently observing fields that are located close the ecliptic plane , and ground - based facilities located in the southern hemisphere can be used to confirm the planetary nature of potential candidates . in this context",
    ", we are conducting a chilean based rv follow - up project of k2 candidates which has already discovered a neptune - sized planet with a period of @xmath10 42 d @xcite .",
    "the two hot jupiters presented is this paper were independently discovered by other teams using facilities from the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the data , which includes the k2 photometry and the high resolution spectra and radial velocities obtained with the harps , feros and coralie spectrographs .",
    " 3 describes the joint analysis that was applied to the data and presents the derived parameters of the planetary systems .",
    "finally , in  4 we discuss our findings .",
    "we analysed the photometric data of k2 s campaigns 4 and 5 .",
    "in particular , we obtained all the decorrelated light curves from @xcite , using the photometry with the optimal aperture .",
    "the method that we used to select the transiting planetary candidates is described in detail in @xcite . after performing a box least squares ( bls , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm , we found that the stars epic210957318",
    "( k2 - 30b ) and epic212110888 ( k2 - 34b ) showed significant periodic signals at 4.1 and 3.0 days , respectively .",
    "both of these systems were selected as strong jovian planetary candidates based on their transit properties ( depths , shapes and durations ) , and due to the lack of evident out of transit variations .",
    "following @xcite , both decorrelated light curves were normalised by applying a median filter with a 21 point ( @xmath11 hour ) window , which was then smoothed using a gaussian filter with a 5-point standard - deviation .",
    "these normalised light curves were then used by our transit - fitting pipeline , which results are shown in section [ analysis ] ( see figures [ cl005_lc ] and [ cl028_lc ] ) .",
    "once both targets were identified as strong transiting hot jupiter candidates , we proceeded to acquire high resolution spectra with three different stabilised instruments with the goal of measuring the rv variation of the stellar hosts produced by the gravitational pull of the planetary companions . in the case of k2 - 30",
    "we obtained 4 spectra using the harps spectrograph @xcite mounted on the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla observatory and 5 spectra using the feros spectrograph @xcite mounted on the mpg 2.2 m telescope located in the same observatory . for k2 - 34 we obtained 7 spectra with feros and 3 spectra using the coralie spectrograph @xcite mounted on the 1.2 m euler telescope in la silla observatory .",
    "the feros and coralie data were obtained using the simultaneous calibration method @xcite , in which we acquire a spectrum of a thar lamp with the comparison fibre while the spectrum of the science star is acquired with the principal fibre .",
    "we use the thar spectra to trace the instrumental instrumental velocity drifts produced by environmental changes inside the spectrograph . on the other hand , since the harps nightly drift is typically @xmath121 m s@xmath13 , the observations with this instrument were performed with the comparison fibre pointing to the background sky in order to avoid contamination from saturated thar lines .",
    "the data from these three instruments were processed through dedicated pipelines built from a modular code that was designed to develop completely robust and automated pipelines for reducing , extracting and analysing echelle spectra of different instruments in a optimal and homogeneous way @xcite .",
    "briefly , the pipelines identify the echelle orders using the flat frames , and after correcting by the bias level and the scattered light , the orders of the science and wavelength calibration images are optimally extracted following @xcite .",
    "the reference global wavelength calibration solution is computed from the calibration thar image acquired in the afternoon by fitting a chebyshev polynomial as a function of the pixel position and echelle order number .",
    "if required , the instrumental drifts during the night are computed using the extracted flux of the comparison fibre , which is illuminated either by a thar lamp or by a fabry - perot etalon .",
    "the extracted flat frames are used to perform the correction by the blaze function , and then , a low order polynomial is fitted to each order , with an iterative algorithm that avoids the inclusion of absorption lines in the fit , in order to construct a continuum normalised spectrum .",
    "the barycentric correction is performed using the jplephem package , and rvs and bisector spans ( bss ) are determined by computing the cross - correlation function between the continuum normalised spectrum and a binary mask that resembles the spectrum of a g2 type star .",
    "we found that both systems present rv variations in phase with the photometric ephemeris , and with semi - amplitudes consistent with planetary companions .",
    "table  [ table : rv_list ] lists the resulting rv variations and bss computed for both systems , which are plotted against each other in figure  [ correls ] .",
    "the the lack of correlation between both parameters supports the planetary hypothesis as an explanation for the transits observed in k2 - 30 and k2 - 34 . in figures  [ cl005_rvs_comb ] and [ cl028_rvs_comb ]",
    "we show the phase - folded rvs for k2 - 30 and k2 - 34 obtained in this work , along with the measurements reported by the other groups .",

    "@xcite , and using only the k2 light - curves extracted with the optimal aperture according to @xcite , which corresponds to 3 pixels ( 12 ) for k2 - 30 and 4 pixels ( 16 ) for k2 - 34 , we obtain a ffp of 0.18% and 21% for k2 - 30b and k2 - 34b , respectively . given that our rv measurements are in phase with the photometric ephemeris and that their semi - amplitudes are consistent with planetary mass companions , the obtained ffps correspond to upper limits in both cases .",
    "nonetheless , the fpp of k2 - 30b is smaller than the accepted 1% threshold ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the fpp of k2 - 34b drops to 0.052% , which validates its planetary nature .",

    "however , most of these contaminant sources can be rejected from the lack of evident additional stars in the poss images centred in k2 - 30 and k2 - 34 ; and also due to the lack of secondary peaks in the ccf plots .",

    "we searched for additional signals in the photometry of both targets stars in order to search for additional transiting companions , secondary eclipses and/or optical phase variations due to either reflected light of the detected transiting planets , ellipsoidal variations and/or doppler beaming ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the transit search was performed using the box least squares ( bls ) algorithm on the data with the transit of the detected planetary companion masked . for each significant peak on the bls periodogram , we visually inspected the phased lightcurve in order to search for additional transits .",
    "in addition , the lightcurve was also inspected at periods 2 , 3/2 , 1/2 and 2/3 times the period of the detected transiting planet presented in this work in order to search for additional companions in 2:1 and 3:2 mean - motion resonances .    for both k2 - 30 and k2 - 34 ,",
    "no additional transiting companions were found , which limit the possible companions to transit depths smaller than  200 ppm and  90 ppm , respectively , at 3-sigma .",
    "also , no secondary eclipses and optical phase variations were detected on either lightcurve .",
    "given the transit parameters that we obtain of k2 - 30b , the non - detection of a secondary eclipse was expected , as they would have to be smaller than @xmath96 ppm .",
    "optical phase variations were expected to be below this limit as well . in the case of k2 - 34b ,",
    "@xmath97 ppm , and our analysis rules out any secondary eclipse larger than 90 ppm at 3-sigma ; this implies that the geometric albedo of k2 - 34b is constrained by our data to be less than 0.45 , which is in agreement again with the typical geometric albedo of hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "no optical phase variations were detected either .",
    "in this paper we present an independent discovery of two transiting hot jupiters orbiting main sequence stars , that were first selected as candidates from k2 photometry of campaigns 4 and 5 .",
    "the planetary nature of these two objects was then confirmed by precision rv measurements using three high resolution echelle spectrographs located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "both systems were recently announced by other teams that performed independent follow - up campaigns using spectroscopic facilities located in the northern hemisphere @xcite . even though the data presented in this work was sufficient for confirming the planetary nature of both candidates and to obtain reliable estimations for their physical parameters , we decided to include the radial velocity measurements obtained in these three other works in order to refine the estimation of the planetary parameters .",
    "this procedure allowed us to have a better phase coverage for both orbits , which was particularly useful in the case of k2 - 34b , for which the use of velocity measurements obtained from facilities at different geographical longitudes allow us to partially counteract the effect produced by the peculiar value of the orbital period of this planet , which is almost exactly a multiple of one day . by combining the radial velocity data we obtained smaller uncertainties in the masses for both planets with respect the the errors reported by the other three groups .",
    "however , the planetary mass estimations obtained by all the different groups agree with each other at the level of the reported uncertainties    we found that the mass of k2 - 30b is in - between the saturn and jupiter mass ( @xmath98 ) , while its radius ( @xmath99 ) is slightly larger than the one of jupiter . in contrast , we found that k2 - 34 is significantly more massive ( @xmath100 ) and larger @xmath101 ) than jupiter .",
    "however , the physical and orbital properties of both of these systems resemble quite well the ones of the typical population of known hot jupiters , which can be visualised with figure  [ disc ] . in the left panel of figure [ disc ] , the mass - radius diagram for the complete population of discovered transiting hot jupiters ( @xmath102 days , @xmath103 ) , shows that according to our analysis , the physical parameters of k2 - 30b and k2 - 34b lie in densely populated regions of the parameters space , and that both planets share a similar density , close to half the one of jupiter ( @xmath104 g @xmath105 ) .",
    "another particularity to notice from figure [ disc ] is that , while the inferred radius of k2 - 30b can be explained with the models of planetary structure of @xcite by requiring a core mass of @xmath106 m@xmath107 , the radius of k2 - 34b is significantly larger than that predicted by these models , and suffers from the radiative and/or tidal inflation mechanisms that typical hot jupiters are victims of ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that , while the radius for k2 - 30b computed by @xcite is consistent with the one presented in this work requiring the presence of a solid core , @xcite found a larger radius for this planet which requires no core and a certain level of inflation .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy relies in the estimation of the physical parameters of the host star .",
    "while the stellar radius for k2 - 30 reported in this work ( 0.839 @xmath108 0.015 @xmath109 ) is consistent with the estimation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath108 0.032 @xmath109 ) , @xcite obtains a significantly larger value ( 0.941 @xmath108 0.041 @xmath109 ) .",
    "this issue shows the importance of performing homogeneous analysis when global trends and correlations between planetary and stellar parameters are searched . for k2 - 34b , the different estimations of the planetary radius presented by the other groups are consistent with the value reported in this work .",
    "the presented dichotomy in the structure of k2 - 30b and k2 - 34b can be explained by the different insolation levels to which they are subjected .",
    "the right panel of figure [ disc ] , shows the radii of the discovered transiting hot jupiters as function of their equilibrium temperatures assuming zero albedo , which shows the correlation first noted by @xcite .",
    "while the equilibrium temperature of k2 - 30b ( 1203 k ) is relatively close to the threshold limit proposed by @xcite of @xmath110 k , below which the inflation of the radius of jovian planets is not significant ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the equilibrium temperature of k2 - 34b is relatively high ( 1715 k ) and its inferred radius is totally compatible with the correlation .    finally , the two systems are interesting candidates for follow - up studies .",
    "the low density of k2 - 30b combined with the relatively small radius of its host star implies a scale height of 340 km and a transmission spectroscopic signal of 744 ppm ( assuming an h@xmath111 dominated atmosphere and a signal of 5 scale - heights ) , which means that this system is a good target to be observed via transmission spectroscopy to characterize its atmosphere .",
    "in addition to the large expected signal , this system possesses a nearby ( @xmath112 ) stellar companion with a similar brightness , which can be used as a comparison source for long slit transmission spectroscopy . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath113 value of k2 - 34 and its moderately bright nature , make of this system a good target for measuring the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in order to determine the sky - projected obliquity angle .",
    "this effect has indeed been already measured by @xcite , who found that k2 - 34b probably lies in a prograde orbit with low obliquity .",

    "<S> k2 - 34b has a mass of @xmath4 , a radius of @xmath5 and has an orbital period of 3.0 days in which it orbits a late f dwarf ( @xmath6 k ) solar metallicity star . </S>",
    "<S> both planets were confirmed via precision radial velocity ( rv ) measurements obtained with three spectrographs from the southern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> they have physical and orbital properties similar to the ones of the already uncovered population of hot jupiters and are well - suited candidates for further orbital and atmospheric characterization via detailed follow - up observations . given that the discovery of both systems was recently reported by other groups we take the opportunity of refining the planetary parameters by including the rvs obtained by these independent studies in our global analysis . </S>"
