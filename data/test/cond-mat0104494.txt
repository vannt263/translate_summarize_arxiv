    "the ability to predict the conditions under which a material will yield is of great fundamental interest and technological importance @xcite . over the past three centuries , a number of yield criteria have been formulated that predict whether a combination of stresses on a solid will produce irreversible deformation . in this paper , we use molecular dynamics simulations to test the applicability of these criteria to amorphous polymer glasses under multiaxial loading .",
    "the yield criterion that is most commonly used for polymer glasses is the pressure - modified von mises ( pmvm ) criterion .",
    "the original von mises criterion @xcite was based on the assumption that yield occurs in the material when the elastic free energy associated with the shear deformation @xmath0 reaches a critical value . for small deformations of an isotropic material , @xmath0 is proportional to the square of the octahedral or deviatoric stress @xmath1 where the @xmath2 denote the three principal stress components and @xmath3 is the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "if one ignores anharmonic effects , the condition of yield at constant @xmath0 can be reformulated as yield at a constant threshold value of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5    for polymers it is often observed @xcite that tensile pressure promotes yielding and compressive pressure delays yielding , which is not accounted for in eq .",
    "( [ vonmises - eq ] ) .",
    "the pressure modified von mises criterion @xcite includes a linear pressure dependence in the value of the octahedral shear stress at yield , @xmath6 this pressure modification is motivated by an analogy to friction , where the shear stress is linearly related to normal pressure , rather than to an energy argument like that used to motivate eq .",
    "( [ vonmises - eq ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath7 then plays the role of an internal friction coefficient .",
    "( [ pressure - eq ] ) is also employed to describe the shear yield stress in granular materials @xcite .",
    "the pressure - modified tresca criterion ( pmt ) is also often quoted in the context of polymer yielding . here",
    "the relevant quantity is assumed to be the maximum shear stress @xmath8 and yield is assumed to occur at @xmath9 the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ tresca - eq ] ) is chosen so that , for the same @xmath10 and @xmath7 , the pmt and pmvm criteria coincide when any two of the three principal stress components are identical . in all other cases ,",
    "the pmt criterion gives a lower yield stress .",
    "several experimental studies are available that address the macroscopic yield behavior of polymers . in these experiments ,",
    "the material is typically strained at a constant strain rate using convenient geometries .",
    "the most commonly studied stress states are uniaxial tension or compression , pure shear , and plane strain compression .",
    "several different definitions of the yield point have been employed to determine the yield stress .",
    "most authors @xcite take the maximum of the stress - strain curve as the yield stress .",
    "the offset - stress @xcite is also used , particularly when the stress - strain curve exhibits no clear maximum .",
    "it is given by the intersection of the stress - strain curve with a straight line that has the same initial slope as the stress - strain curve but is offset on the strain - axis by a specified strain , e.g. 0.2% ( see figure [ yieldonset - fig ] ) .",
    "the offset stress is motivated by the idea that if the load was removed , the sample would relax elastically along the straight line to an unrecoverable strain that is equal to the offset stress . however , the relaxation is generally more complicated .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that the true yield point ought to be determined from the residual strain measured after unloading .",
    "they define the yield stress as the smallest stress value that gives a nonzero residual strain .",
    "raghava et al .",
    "@xcite collected yield data for polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) , polystyrene ( ps ) , polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) , and polycarbonate ( pc ) . despite the fact that different definitions of yield were used , all data fit the pmvm criterion@xcite with the same value of @xmath11 . more recently , quinson et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that pmma is always well described by the pmvm criterion , but that ps follows the pmt criterion at low temperatures and pc always follows the pmt criterion .",
    "they associated the validity of the pmt criterion with the occurrence of shear bands .",
    "however , bubeck et al .",
    "@xcite measured a larger number of yield points for pc and found that they fit the pmvm criterion .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the use of different yield point definitions in the two studies .",
    "the small number of uni- and biaxial stress states considered in experimental studies makes it hard to distinguish the two criteria .",
    "no experimental tests of yield criteria appear to have considered triaxial stress states .    on the simulation side , both monte carlo @xcite and molecular dynamics simulations",
    "@xcite have been presented for uniaxial deformation of polymer glasses .",
    "coarse - grained stochastic dynamics of shear flow of local volumes has also been considered @xcite .",
    "these models were shown to qualitatively reproduce experimental stress - strain curves and their dependence on temperature and strain rate .",
    "however , we are unaware of any studies that address multiaxial stress states and relate them to yield criteria",
    ".    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model - sec ]",
    "we discuss the details of our model interaction potential for polymer glasses and our method for imposing and measuring stress and strain .",
    "section [ results - sec ] begins with a comparison of yield stresses calculated from different definitions of the yield point .",
    "we then determine both the maximum stress and the offset stress in multiaxial stress states and compare the results to the pmvm and pmt criteria . in particular , we address the nature of the pressure dependence of the yield stress and investigate the validity of eqs .",

    "the above potentials produce very flexible polymer chains , since no third- , or fourth - body potentials are present .",
    "melt studies of the bead - spring model have recently been extended to include the effect of polymer rigidity @xcite . following these authors , we consider a bond - bending potential for each chain , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the position of the @xmath22th bead along the chain , and @xmath23 characterizes the stiffness .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using the velocity - verlet algorithm with a timestep of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the characteristic time given by the lj energy and length scales .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are employed in all directions to eliminate edge effects .",
    "we consider two system sizes of 32768 beads and 262144 beads at two temperatures of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is very close to the glass transition temperature @xmath29 for this model @xcite , and @xmath30 represents an effectively athermal system .",
    "the temperature is controlled with a nos - hoover thermostat ( thermostat rate @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "to study the yield behavior , we impose tensile or compressive strains @xmath32 on one or more axes of the initially cubically symmetric solid at constant strain rates of @xmath33 or less . figure [ strainillu - fig ] illustrates some of the important limiting stress states that are discussed below . for uni- and biaxial studies of yielding ,",
    "the stresses @xmath34 in the remaining two or one directions are maintained at zero by a nos - hoover barostat ( barostat rate @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "note that since @xmath36 , the strain rates employed are 8 - 9 orders of magnitude higher than typical experimental strain rates .",
    "nevertheless by comparing to typical sound velocities we can ensure that our strain rates are slow enough that stresses can equilibrate across the system and thus loading proceeds nearly quasistatically .",
    "a detailed study of the rate dependence of yielding in polymers will be presented elsewhere .",
    "all stresses in this paper are true stresses , i.  e. @xmath37 , where a is the instantaneous cross - sectional area .",
    "likewise , we use true or logarithmic strains @xmath38 . in all cases ,",
    "stresses are averaged over the entire simulation cell .",
    "our model lets us address a variety of different physical situations .",
    "the influence of adhesive interactions on yielding can be examined by varying the lj potential cutoff distance from @xmath39 , which gives a purely repulsive interaction , to @xmath40 or @xmath41 , which include progressively longer ranges of the attractive tail of the lj potential . as a byproduct , the density of the solid at zero pressure changes with @xmath42 .",
    "polymer dynamics in the melt is greatly influenced by chain length , particularly when entanglements are present .",
    "to study the effect of chain length on yielding , we consider an entangled case @xmath43 and an unentangled case @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the entanglement length of the flexible bead - spring model @xcite . the bond - bending potential @xmath46 is also varied from the flexible limit @xmath47 to a semiflexible case @xmath48 .",
    "we begin by considering a uniaxial tension simulation , in which the polymer glass is expanded in one direction , while zero stress is maintained in the perpendicular plane .",
    "figure [ yieldonset - fig ] shows the resulting stress - strain curve .",
    "it exhibits the typical features of a polymer glass : linear response is followed by a nonlinear region that bends over into a maximum .",
    "note that the maximum is reached at at strain of about 6% , which is in very good agreement with experimental stress strain curves , see e.  g.  @xcite . once past that maximum , the stress drops slightly and the material begins to flow , but",
    "these large strains are not shown .",
    "[ yieldonset - fig ] also illustrates how to obtain the maximum and offset yield stresses as described in the introduction .",
    "both quantities are easy to identify for uniaxial stress . to make contact with the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have also determined the amount of residual strain after unloading .",
    "squares show the residual strain @xmath49 as a function of the maximum strain before unloading .",
    "results for @xmath50 are comparable to the residual strains given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "these authors identified the yield point with the strain where a linear extrapolation of @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "we have extended our studies to much smaller residual strains and find no evidence of a threshold strain below which the residual strain vanishes .",
    "studies of other glassy systems also suggest that at @xmath51 a finite unrecoverable strain should be present for arbitrarily small initial strains , but the theoretical situation at finite @xmath52 is more complicated @xcite",
    ".    note that in order to obtain 0.2% residual strain , the initial extension has to be about 4% .",
    "this is about twice as large as the yield strain from the 0.2% offset criterion .",
    "the offset criterion assumes elastic recovery along the line determined by the elastic moduli of the unperturbed solid .",
    "examination of the recovery curves shows that they are non - linear .",
    "this confirms that much of the nonlinear response under loading to the triangle in fig .",
    "[ yieldonset - fig ] is due to recoverable , but anharmonic deformations .",
    "the above discussion raises questions about both the applicability of the unrecoverable strain definition of the yield point and the motivation for the offset stress definition .",
    "however , since the offset stress is widely used in engineering applications , we consider both it and the maximum stress definition in the following sections .",
    "figure [ yieldstressdef - fig ] shows the principal stress components @xmath2 as well as",
    "the octahedral shear stress @xmath4 for ( a ) biaxial and ( b ) triaxial loading . in multiaxial stress states one needs to plot the stress(es ) against a scalar effective strain @xmath53 constructed from the three principal components @xmath54 of the strain tensor .",
    "this choice is not unique , and influences the value obtained for the offset stress .",
    "a convenient choice that we employ in this paper is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is poisson s ratio .",
    "this expression is proportional to the octahedral strain and reduces to @xmath57 under uniaxial loading .",
    "it also reduces to the effective strain defined in ref .",
    "@xcite for biaxial strains , and allows us to treat all strain states on the same footing .",
    "[ yieldstressdef - fig](a ) illustrates the maximum and offset definitions of the yield point for biaxial stresses .",
    "the maximum of the stress - strain curves is straightforward to evaluate ( solid circles ) , and both nonzero stress components peak at the same strain . by contrast , the offset definition gives yield at slightly different strains ( solid triangles ) . this is troubling , since a yield point should refer to a unique instance in time or strain .",
    "moreover , the offset stress depends on arbitrary factors in the definition of the effective strain and in the amount of offset at the yield point .",
    "we also evaluated the residual strain for different biaxial loading conditions and added them to fig .",
    "[ yieldonset - fig ] ( diamonds ) .",
    "interestingly , these residual strains fall onto the same curve as the results from uniaxial extension when plotted against @xmath53 . as",
    "above , there is no indication of a finite threshold below which the residual strain vanishes .",
    "[ yieldstressdef - fig](b ) shows that determining the yield point is even more complicated under triaxial loading . for this case",
    ", only the tensile stress component exhibits a clear maximum .",
    "the compressive components decrease monotonically over the range shown .",
    "moreover , the slope of these curves increases in magnitude with strain so that they do not intersect the line for the offset criterion .    in order to make progress for general multiaxial stress states , we thus decided to apply both the maximum and offset stress definitions not to the three stress components individually , but to the octahedral shear stress @xmath4 .",
    "this is a natural choice given that @xmath4 is the quantity that enters the pmvm criterion .",
    "the method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ yieldstressdef - fig ] and again in fig .",
    "[ stressstrain15-fig ] , where @xmath4 is plotted against the effective strain in a variety of uni- , bi- , and triaxial stress states . for the biaxial states considered in experiments the yield strains obtained from @xmath58 and @xmath59 separately are nearly the same as that determined from @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus the value of @xmath60 is the same as that constructed from the separate yield components .    in the initial elastic response ,",
    "stress and strain tensors are linearly related by a combination of the elastic moduli @xmath61 of the solid .",
    "the moduli are defined by @xmath62 , from which we obtain @xmath63 by straightforward insertion .",
    "thus a plot of @xmath4 versus @xmath53 should collapse all curves onto a stress - strain curve with common initial slope .",
    "[ stressstrain15-fig ] shows that this condition is satisfied for two different temperatures and system sizes .",
    "all curves start out with the same slope , but they split apart rapidly at higher strains .",
    "this reflects the influence of pressure on yielding .",
    "we will show later that this pressure dependence is well described by eq .",
    "( [ pressure - eq ] ) for both yield point definitions . as in experiments ,",
    "the yield stresses decrease with increasing temperature .    the larger systems in fig .",
    "[ stressstrain15-fig](b ) exhibit much smoother curves , since many more independent yield events contribute to the average stress response .",
    "however , since the values of yield stress and strain do not change significantly with size , we use systems with 32768 beads in most cases .",
    "this speeds up the computations and allows a larger parameter space to be explored .",
    "note that each curve represents the stress response for one particular initial configuration of polymers in the glassy state .",
    "we have observed variations on the order of 5% in the magnitude of @xmath64 with different 32768 bead configurations , but the general features of yielding remained unaltered .",
    "experimental tests of yield criteria have generally considered uniaxial or biaxial loading conditions . in the biaxial case",
    ", the pmvm criterion predicts that the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 at yield should lie on the surface of an ellipse in the @xmath65 - plane .",
    "the equation for this ellipse can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ pressure - eq ] ) by letting @xmath66 : @xmath67    a nonzero value of @xmath7 breaks the tensile / compressive symmetry and shifts the ellipse towards the lower left quadrant ( where the stress is compressive ) . the amount of the shift increases with @xmath7 . the pmt criterion predicts a yield surface bounded by straight lines . for the same @xmath10 and @xmath7 ,",
    "it coincides with the pmvm criterion whenever two of the stresses are equal .    in fig .",

    "we have tested this isotropy in selected cases and find variations on the order of the symbol sizes .",

    "[ taup - fig](b ) shows the offset yield stresses for two temperatures .",

    "[ stressstrain15-fig ] one sees that the value of @xmath7 from the offset criterion depends on the rate at which stress increases with pressure at fixed strain , and the slope of the stress - strain curve near the intersection .",
    "both factors change with temperature and the choice of offset at yield .",
    "for this reason , it is not surprising that values of @xmath7 from the offset criterion show larger variations than those from determined from the maximum stress .",
    "intuitively one would expect that increasing adhesive interactions between polymers would lead to a higher yield stress .",
    "in our model this can be achieved by increasing @xmath42 , which controls how much of the attractive tail in the lj potential is included .",
    "we have verified that increasing @xmath42 to @xmath74 produces higher yield stresses and that the yield points are consistent with the pmvm criterion .",

    "increasing @xmath42 also suppresses cavitation . the magnitude of the tensile pressure needed to produce cavitation under hydrostatic loading increased by 2 @xmath75 at both temperatures .    the opposite limit that we can consider is the purely repulsive potential obtained when @xmath76 .",

    "shear banding can be influenced by boundary conditions and the method of imposing shear .",
    "in particular , our periodic boundary conditions inhibit shear banding and this may be why the pmvm criterion always provided a better fit to the yield stress .",
