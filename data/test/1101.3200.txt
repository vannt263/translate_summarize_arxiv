    "the schreier graphs are generalizations of the cayley graph of a group , which corresponds to the action of a group on itself by the left multiplication .",

    "many classical groups ( like linear groups , solvable groups , hyperbolic groups , etc . ) have either polynomial or exponential growth .",
    "the first group of intermediate growth between polynomial and exponential was constructed by r.  grigorchuk @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the grigorchuk group is the best known example of automaton groups ( also known as self - similar groups , or groups generated by automata ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the growth of schreier graphs of automaton groups .",
    "every automaton group @xmath9 generated by an automaton @xmath17 over some alphabet @xmath1 naturally acts on the set @xmath18 for every @xmath19 , and on the space @xmath0 of right - infinite sequences over @xmath1 .",
    "we get the associated sequence of finite schreier graphs @xmath20 of the action @xmath21 , and the family of orbital schreier graphs @xmath22 for @xmath2 of the action of @xmath9 on the orbit of @xmath4 .",
    "the schreier graphs @xmath23 and @xmath5 provide a large source of self - similar graphs , and were studied in relation to such topics as spectrum , growth , amenability , topology of julia sets , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that for a few automaton groups the sequence of schreier graphs @xmath23 converges to a nice metric space with fractal structure .",
    "further , this observation lead to the notion of a limit space of an automaton group , and , more generally , to a limit dynamical system @xcite .",
    "the expanding property of this dynamical system corresponds to the contracting property of a group , what brings us to the important class of contracting automaton groups .",
    "namely the strong contracting properties of the grigorchuk group was used to prove that it has intermediate growth , while in general a contracting group may have exponential growth . at the same time , all orbital schreier graphs @xmath5 of contracting groups have polynomial growth @xcite .",
    "the degree of the growth is related to the asymptotic characteristics of the group such as the complexity of the word problem , the hausdorff dimension of the limit space , the exponent of divergence of geodesics in the associated gromov - hyperbolic self - similarity complex , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "most of the studied automaton groups are generated by polynomial automata .",
    "these automata were introduced by s.  sidki in @xcite , who tried to classify automaton groups by the cyclic structure of the generating automaton .",
    "a finite automaton is called polynomial if the simple directed cycles away from the trivial state are disjoint .",
    "the term polynomial \" comes from the equivalent definition , where a finite automaton is polynomial if the number of paths of length @xmath24 avoiding the trivial state in the automaton grows polynomially in  @xmath24 .",
    "it is an open problem whether contracting groups and groups generated by polynomial automata are amenable .",
    "however , it is known that these groups do not contain nonabelian free subgroups @xcite ( but may contain free semigroups and be of exponential growth ) , and that groups generated by polynomial automata of degree @xmath25 ( bounded automata ) are amenable  @xcite . in @xcite v.",
    "nekrashevych introduced a general approach to the existence of free subgroups in automaton groups , and applied it to contracting groups and to groups generated by polynomial automata . in order to eliminate one of the cases",
    ", he proved that the orbital schreier graphs @xmath5 are amenable , and conjectured @xcite that these graphs may have subexponential growth .",
    "this conjecture was based on the results from @xcite , where it is shown that for the group generated by one of the simplest polynomial automata all schreier graphs @xmath5 have intermediate growth .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove this conjecture .",

    "in particular , we prove that the word problem in these groups is solvable in subexponential time bounded above by @xmath29 for some constant  @xmath30 .",
    "we also prove theorem  [ theorem_main ] for a more general class of automata ( see theorem  [ theorem_growth_schr_general ] in section  [ generalized version ] ) , which generalizes both polynomial automata and contracting groups .",
    "in section  [ section_examples ] we apply theorem  [ theorem_main ] and its generalized version to construct automaton groups with schreier graphs @xmath5 of intermediate growth . in the first example we consider a class of automaton groups , whose schreier graphs @xmath5 are a generalized version of the @xmath8-periodic graph of intermediate growth studied in @xcite .",
    "basically , this example shows that for many polynomial automata the schreier graphs @xmath5 have intermediate growth .",
    "another example comes from the well - known hanoi tower game on @xmath31 pegs .",
