    "calorons are instantons at finite temperature . for a long time the influence of a background polyakov loop on the properties of these topological excitations has been neglected .",
    "solutions were constructed long ago  @xcite and were studied in detail in the semi - classical approximation  @xcite . in all these studies",
    "the polyakov loop at spatial infinity ( also called the holonomy ) was trivial , i.e. an element of the center of the gauge group . that the influence of the background polyakov loop on the topological excitations can be dramatic is particularly clear in the confined phase , where on average its trace vanishes .",
    "caloron solutions in such backgrounds were constructed only relatively recently  @xcite and can be seen as composed of massive monopole constituents with their magnetic charges adding to zero .",
    "it was observed that the one - loop correction to the action for configurations with a non - trivial asymptotic value of the polyakov loop gives rise to an infinite action barrier , which were therefore considered irrelevant  @xcite .",
    "however , the infinity simply arises due to the integration over the finite energy _ density _ induced by the perturbative fluctuations in the background of a non - trivial polyakov loop  @xcite .",
    "the proper setting would therefore rather be to calculate the non - perturbative contribution of calorons ( with a given asymptotic value of the polyakov loop ) to this energy density , as was first successfully implemented in supersymmetric theories  @xcite , where the perturbative contribution vanishes .",
    "it has a minimum where the trace of the polyakov loop vanishes , i.e. at maximal non - trivial holonomy .    in a recent study at high temperatures , where one presumably can trust the semi - classical approximation ,",
    "the non - perturbative contribution of these monopole constituents ( also called dyons ) was computed  @xcite . when added to the perturbative contribution  @xcite with its minima at center elements , a local minimum develops where the trace of the polyakov loop vanishes , deepening further for decreasing temperature .",
    "this gives support for a phase in which the center symmetry , broken in the high temperature phase , is restored and provides an indication that the monopole constituents are the relevant degrees of freedom for the confined phase .",
    "also lattice studies , both using cooling  @xcite and chiral fermion zero - modes  @xcite as filters , have now confirmed that monopole constituents do dynamically occur in the confined phase . a charge 1 caloron is seen for su(@xmath0 ) to consist of @xmath0 constituent monopoles .",
    "in the deconfined phase , due to the fact that the average polyakov loop becomes a center element , the caloron returns to the form known as the harrington - shepard solution  @xcite .",
    "the latter can also be interpreted as consisting of constituent monopoles , however , with @xmath1 of them being massless .    to be precise , for self - dual configurations in the background of non - trivial holonomy the masses of constituent monopoles are given by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",

    "when constituents of equal charge come together typically an extended core structure is found .",
    "this was deduced , in particular for the case of charge 2 calorons , from our ability to analytically determine the zero - mode density ( summed over the two zero - modes implied by the index theorem ) in the far field limit , neglecting exponential contributions , such that the range of the exponential contributions shrinks inversely proportional with the temperature . ] . in this limit",
    "it forms a singular distribution on a disc bounded by an ellipse , but approaches two delta functions for well - separated like - charge constituents .",
    "this zero - mode density only sees constituents of a given charge , depending on the boundary condition for the fermions in the imaginary time direction , which can be chosen to be a u(1 ) phase ( containing the physically relevant choice of anti - periodic boundary conditions for thermal field theory ) .",
    "we will show for su(2 ) that their difference for periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions coincides _ exactly _ with the ( abelian ) charge distribution extracted from the gauge field in the same limit , making contact with an old result due to hurtubise  @xcite for the asymptotic behaviour of the monopole higgs field .",

    "deforming away from the axial configuration the two discs overlap . describing the intricate behaviour for the non - abelian core of these configurations in this region of the parameter space requires one to find exact solutions , which are presented here .",

    "an appendix presents a new result for the limiting behaviour of the action density .",
    "there are two steps in the construction of charge @xmath14 caloron solutions .",
    "the first step involves finding a @xmath21 gauge field @xmath22 , which satisfies the self - duality equation , i.e. the nahm equation  @xcite , on a circle parametrized by @xmath23 , with @xmath23 introduced through replacing the original su(@xmath0 ) gauge field @xmath24 by @xmath25 . although not affecting the field strength , this changes the holonomy to @xmath26 , revealing that @xmath23 has period @xmath27 .",
    "the index theorem guarantees the existence of @xmath14 zero - modes @xmath28 which satisfy the dirac equation , or in the two - component weyl form    @xmath29 ( @xmath30 are the usual pauli matrices )",
    ". we may remove @xmath23 from the gauge field @xmath24 by transforming the zero - mode to @xmath31 , which is at the expense of making the zero - mode only periodic up to a phase factor , @xmath32 . in a similar way we could introduce @xmath33 through @xmath34 , which replaces in @xmath24 by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . assuming the @xmath14 zero - modes @xmath37 to be orthonormal one has a^ab_(z)=^(a)(x;z , z)^^(b)(x;z , z ) d^4x,[eq : ndual ] or equivalently ( demonstrating as well that @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath33 ) a^ab_0(z)=^(a)(x;z)^ ^(b)(x;z ) d^4x , a^ab_k(z)=2i^(a)(x;z)^ x_k^(b)(x;z)d^4x .",
    "we have shown how @xmath22 can alternatively be related to a fourier transformation of the adhm construction of instantons  @xcite , that periodically repeat ( up to a gauge rotation with @xmath7 ) in the imaginary time direction , so as to turn an infinite charge instanton in @xmath39 to one of finite charge and finite temperature .",
    "the derivation of this relation will not be repeated here , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details .",
    "the connection to the adhm construction has been useful to simplify the second step in the construction of the caloron solutions , namely how to reconstruct the original gauge field when given a solution to the nahm equation  @xcite ( which is equivalent to the quadratic adhm constraint ) , a_j(z)+[a_0(z),a_j(z)]+_jk[a_k(z ) , a_(z)]=2i_m(z-_m)_m^j,[eq : nahmeq ] for convenience of notation we will henceforth use the classical scale invariance to set @xmath40 .",
    "the singularities in the nahm equation appear precisely for those values where @xmath41 has one of its eigenvalues equal to 1 , at @xmath42 .",
    "this is where some fermion field components become massless , i.e. the zero - mode becomes delocalized , whereas for generic values of @xmath23 it is exponentially localized , which has turned out to be a useful tool to pinpoint the constituent monopoles .",
    "one could apply the nahm transformation again , introducing @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 ) and find the @xmath0 chiral fermion zero - modes in the background of this gauge field .",
    "the construction is somewhat complicated due to the presence of the singularities , whose structure is determined from the matrices @xmath45 which appear in the nahm equation .",
    "not all @xmath46 are independent , e.g. integrating and tracing the nahm equation yields the conditions , @xmath47 .",
    "further constraints are implied  @xcite by the fact that one may introduce ( as is most easily seen in relation to the adhm construction ) @xmath14 two - component spinors @xmath48 in the @xmath49 representation of su(@xmath0 ) , such that 2_a^p_m_b=_0s_m^ab-_m^ab,[eq : srho ] where @xmath50 are projections defined through @xmath51 ( @xmath52 will appear in ) .",

    "as mentioned before , from our multi - caloron results one can recover the multi - monopole results by sending the constituent monopoles with the  unwanted \" magnetic charge to infinity , cmp . .",
    "although this tends to be cumbersome to show , @xmath281 in the far field can be written as @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is the contribution coming from the type @xmath83 constituent monopoles and the difference in sign is due to the sign change in the magnetic charge .",
    "this is simply because the field is abelian in the far field and linear superposition preserves the self - duality .",
    "hence , @xmath284 , such that for the su(2 ) caloron ( x)=2_1(x)-2_2(x ) .",
    "we checked that this result indeed holds for the solutions discussed in sect .",

    "@xcite , where @xmath281 was explicitly shown to factorize in a sum of point charge contributions , compatible with what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the zero - mode densities .",
    "therefore , in the far field limit ( i.e. for the algebraic part ) the singularity structure in the zero - mode density agrees _ exactly _ with the abelian charge distribution , as given by @xmath285 .",
    "such a relation is at the heart of using chiral fermion zero - modes as a filter to isolate the underlying topological lumps from rough lattice monte carlo configurations  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the higher charge caloron solutions and showed how to obtain exact results by suitably combining techniques developed in the context of the nahm transformation and the adhm formalism .",
    "the aim of these studies has been to establish that su(@xmath0 ) caloron solutions of charge @xmath14 can be described in terms of @xmath15 monopole constituents , and that these can be viewed as independent constituents . a natural way to get",
    "an ensemble would be to consider approximate superpositions of @xmath14 charge 1 calorons , but this would lead to an unwanted memory effect , with constituents remembering from which caloron they originated  @xcite . our studies , within the context of self - dual configurations , have shown nevertheless that the constituents have an independent identity , with the only requirement that the net magnetic and electric charge of the configuration vanishes ( each of the @xmath0 types of constituents should occur with the same number ) .",
    "a recent lattice study  @xcite , using the technique of over - improvement  @xcite , fully confirms this picture .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to consider the constituents as the independent building blocks for constructing an ensemble of monopole constituents , something that was not questioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , but like for the instanton liquid  @xcite forms an essential assumption in a semi - classical study .",
    "clearly the expectation is that semi - classical methods no longer work in the confined regime , at least for the part of the parameter space that corresponds to well - separated constituents , that is typically associated to instantons with a large scale parameter .",
    "it is not unlikely that the density of these constituents at low temperatures is so high that they form a coherent background and as such will no longer easily be recognized as lumps . with high quark densities leading to deconfinement",
    ", it may perhaps be that a high constituent monopole density will lead to confinement  @xcite , although for now we have to leave this as a speculation .",
    "instantons that overlap get deformed and depending on the relative gauge orientation tend to  repel \" , i.e. inspecting the action density distribution they do not get closer than a certain distance  @xcite . when deconstructing instantons in monopole constituents , interestingly",
    "only like - charge constituents will show this effect , manifesting itself through the extended core structure . for unlike charges , from the point of view of the abelian field , the configuration behaves as with linear superposition .",
    "if as a consequence of this all abelian charge is annihilated , it disappears through forming a small instanton ( localized in space and time ) , which in the limit of zero size describes the boundary of the moduli - space .",
    "the interaction between constituents of opposite duality is more complicated  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "calorons with non - trivial holonomy have revealed a rich structure , incorporating traditional instanton physics , but allowing for gauge fields that inherit some essential features associated to a confining background not present in the traditional formulations .",
    "the fact that the underlying constituents are monopoles opens the way to describe the confining aspects of the theory in terms of these degrees of freedom .",
