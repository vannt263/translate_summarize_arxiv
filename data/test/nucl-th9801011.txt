    "parity violating electron - nucleus scattering is important for several reasons .",
    "first , it provides a test of the standard model at low energies .",
    "indeed , an early experiment on @xmath3c was performed [ 1 ] ( with somewhat limited accuracy ) .",
    "second , it is sensitive to strange quarks in the nucleon or nucleus .",
    "proposed jefferson laboratory experiments hope to extract strange quark contributions to the electric form factor of the nucleon from elastic scattering on @xmath2he [ 2 ] .",
    "finally , parity violation provides a unique and very clean way to study neutron densities and isospin violation in nuclei [ 3 ] .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 couples predominantly to neutrons .",
    "[ note , the @xmath0 proton coupling depends on the small factor @xmath5 . ]",
    "an accurate measurement of neutron distributions in a heavy nucleus would provide fundamental nuclear structure information .",
    "it will constrain isovector terms in the nuclear matter energy functional such as the surface symmetry energy .",
    "this could be important in astrophysics when one extrapolates to unstable very asymmetric nuclei .",
    "furthermore , a measurement of neutron radii will significantly aid the interpretation of future atomic parity violation measurements .",
    "the present @xmath6 experiment is accurate to 0.3 percent [ 4 ] . pushing the accuracy of atomic experiments is important as a test of the standard model and as a search for new physics .",
    "however , a 0.1 percent measurement in a heavy atom will require knowing the neutron radius to of order one percent [ 5 ] ( to keep uncertainties in the neutron density from interfering with a standard model test ) .",
    "the charge density is known from elastic electron scattering .",
    "thus , to determine the neutron radius to one percent requires knowing the difference between neutron and proton radii to about 25 percent .",
    "this accuracy is probably beyond that of present nuclear theory ( we comment on this below ) .",
    "furthermore , neutron radii determinations from hadronic probes suffer from large systematic errors .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the parity violating asymmetry for elastic electron scattering should provide crucial information for atomic parity experiments .",
    "atomic experiments also depend on atomic theory ( the overlap of electronic wave function with the nucleus ) which at present is only good to about one percent in @xmath6 [ 6 ] .",
    "however , this accuracy may improve in the future .",
    "if this is not the case , atomic experiments may shift to measuring ratios of parity violation in different isotopes because many of the atomic uncertainties cancel .",
    "isotope ratios place much more stringent requirements on knowledge of the neutron radius and how this changes among isotopes .",
    "this knowledge is beyond present nuclear theory .",
    "however , an accurate measurement of the neutron radius with electron scattering on a single nucleus should still provide an important _ first step _ towards calibrating a theory of neutron radii differences .",
    "electron scattering from a heavy nucleus is modified substantially by coulomb distortions .",
    "these effects are of order @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the nuclear charge ) and will modify the parity violating asymmetry . however , there are no previously published calculations . in the present paper",
    "we accurately calculate coulomb distortion effects with a relativistic optical model . the dirac equation is numerically solved for an electron moving in vector and axial vector potentials .",
    "our formalism is presented in section ii along with checks of the numerics .",
    "elastic parity violating asymmetries from several nuclei are shown in section iii .",
    "results are also shown for a variety of electron energies .",
    "we conclude in section iv that coulomb distortions significantly modify the asymmetry . however these are accurately calculated .",
    "even with distortions , the asymmetry is very sensitive to neutron densities and an experiment to measure the neutron radius in a heavy nucleus is feasible . we also conclude that coulomb distortions are important for a one percent standard model test in @xmath9 or @xmath10 and that such a test may be sensitive to very small differences in proton and neutron radii .",
    "in this section we describe our relativistic optical model formalism and discuss a variety of checks on our numerical results . the electron wave function @xmath11 ( for scattering from a spin zero nucleus )",
    "is assumed to satisfy a dirac equation , @xmath12\\psi = e \\psi.\\eqno(1)\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the center of mass energy and we neglect other center of mass corrections .",
    "the total potential @xmath14 has vector @xmath15 and axial vector @xmath16  components , @xmath17 the conventional coulomb potential is @xmath18  while weak neutral currents give rise to @xmath19 which is of order the fermi constant @xmath20 , @xmath21 the weak charge density @xmath22 is closely related to ( minus ) the neutron density ( see below ) and is normalized , for neutron number @xmath23 and proton number @xmath8 , @xmath24 equation ( 1 ) includes terms of all orders in @xmath7 .",
    "this is important because @xmath7  is large for a heavy nucleus .",
    "equation ( 1 ) neglects radiative corrections , which are higher order in @xmath25 , and dispersion corrections where the intermediate nucleus is in an excited state .    in the limit of vanishing electron mass ,",
    "it is a simple matter to include the effects of the axial potential @xmath16 .",
    "one writes the dirac equation for helicity states with @xmath26 , @xmath27\\psi_\\pm = e \\psi_\\pm,\\eqno(5)\\ ] ] and @xmath28 thus , the positive helicity state scatters from a potential @xmath29 while the negative helicity state scatters from @xmath30 . to calculate the parity violating asymmetry @xmath1",
    "one simply calculates the scattering amplitudes for @xmath29 and @xmath30 and subtracts , @xmath31    we have written a new relativistic optical code elastic which numerically solves the partial wave dirac equation and sums up phase shifts to calculate the scattering amplitude . from the amplitude it calculates the following observables : the unpolarized cross section , the parity conserving analyzing power @xmath32 ( for an initial electron spin normal to the reaction plane ) , the parity violating asymmetry @xmath1 and the spin rotation parameter @xmath33",
    ". this is related to the angle through which the electron s spin is rotated when it scatters from the nucleus [ 7 ] . the normal analyzing power @xmath32 is of order @xmath34 and vanishes in born approximation .",
    "it is very small , comparable to @xmath1 !",
    "we will discuss @xmath32 in a future paper .",
    "the numerical details of the code will also be presented in a later paper . here",
    "we describe some of the checks which give us confidence in our results .",
    "first the code must reproduce known cross sections .",
    "for example , elastic cross sections from @xmath35 at 502 mev are reproduced out to 3.7 fm@xmath36 ( the extent of the data [ 8 ] ) . near 3.7 fm@xmath36",
    "the error is of order a percent .",
    "the cross section at these large angles is reduced by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this requires that the scattering amplitude be calculated very accurately : indeed , more accurately then needed for the forward angle @xmath1 ( see below ) .",
    "the code has been checked against plane wave results .",
    "we multiplied both @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) by a small factor , say 0.01 .",
    "then the full code was run summing over many partial waves .",
    "finally the resulting cross section was divided by @xmath37 and both the cross section and @xmath1 were compared to know plane wave results .",
    "this check was performed both for @xmath22  proportional to the charge density ( where @xmath1 is linear in @xmath38 ) and for different neutron and proton densities .",
    "the numerical agreement is very good ( better then 0.1 percent for @xmath1 ) except right in the diffraction minima . in the minima",
    ", the exact result should be different from plane wave results even for a system with the small charge of @xmath39 .",
    "this plane wave test is actually more demanding then the full calculation because some numerical errors are magnified in comparison to the small interaction .",
    "the spin rotation parameter @xmath33 should be just , @xmath40 with @xmath41 the electron scattering angle , up to small corrections of order @xmath34 .",
    "this is a nontrivial check since we must sum up over all partial waves to calculate @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( 8) is reproduced by our code except at very large momentum transfers ( beyond 4 @xmath42 for @xmath35 where the cross section is also inaccurate ) .    finally , the only new feature of the @xmath1 calculation is a subtraction of the positive and negative helicity amplitudes . in practice",
    "this is not a problem because the amplitude must be calculated to much better accuracy then a part in @xmath43 ( a typical size for @xmath1 ) in order to reproduce the large angle cross section .",
    "furthermore , many errors cancel in the subtraction .",
    "nevertheless , this can be tested by multiplying just @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) by @xmath44 ( keeping @xmath18 unchanged ) and running the full code .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 is scaled up by a factor of ten and seen to agree well with earlier results .",
    "this procedure makes the subtraction ten times more sensitive and verifies its accuracy .",
    "note , the code calculates observables to all orders in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in practice",
    ", @xmath19 is small so @xmath1 is linear in @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the code can be run with almost any value of @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and the resulting output @xmath1 scaled appropriately .    taken together , these four tests check almost all areas of the calculation and give us confidence in our results . in practice the calculation is no harder then older work for the unpolarized cross section .",
    "indeed , in a helicity basis only very small modifications are needed to include a parity violating potential .",
    "in this section we present results of the code elastic .",
    "we first assume the weak density @xmath45 has the same spatial distribution as the charge density @xmath46 .",
    "this allows one to see the effects of only coulomb distortions .",
    "then we show results for different weak and electromagnetic densities .",
    "to start , we use a simple three parameter fermi charge density for @xmath47pb from ref . [ 9 ] , see table i. this fits all but the back angle electron scattering data .",
    "the weak density is assumed to be proportional to the charge density , @xmath48\\rho(r).\\eqno(9)\\ ] ] this satisfies the normalization condition of eq .",
    "( 4 ) . for simplicity in notation",
    ", we refer to the weak density given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) as being equal to the charge density .",
    "figure 1 shows the asymmetry @xmath1 for @xmath47pb versus momentum transfer @xmath49 both in a plane wave impulse approximation where , @xmath50 \\bigl[{n\\over z }   + 4{\\rm sin}^2 \\theta_w-1\\bigr],\\eqno(9b)\\ ] ] and then including full distortions at electron energies from 502 to 3000 mev .",
    "coulomb distortions are seen to reduce @xmath1 substantially , especially in the diffraction minima . as the energy increases",
    ", the effects of coulomb distortions do not decrease ( very much ) instead there is a slight shift in the position of the diffraction minima to higher momentum transfers .",
    "we conclude from fig .",
    "1 that coulomb distortions must be included for parity violation in a heavy nucleus .    figure 2 shows @xmath1 for @xmath3c at 200 mev .",
    "this is the energy of the original bates experiment[1 ] .",
    "this figure uses a relativistic mean field model [ 10](mft ) for the charge density . for the mft we approximate the weak density as , @xmath51.\\eqno(10)\\ ] ] here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are point neutron and proton densities and the electric form factor of the proton is approximated @xmath54 with @xmath55 fm@xmath36 .",
    "this neglects strange quark contributions , the neutron electric form factor and meson exchange currents .",
    "it also assumes good isospin for the nucleon . for simplicity , all calculations in this paper use sin@xmath56 for the weinberg angle .    the dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 assumes eq .",
    "( 9 ) while the dashed curve uses the mft weak density .",
    "both of these are plane wave calculations .",
    "finally , the solid curve uses the mft weak density and includes coulomb distortions . in the mft",
    "the protons have a slightly larger radius then the neutrons because of coulomb repulsion .",
    "this small change in radius can lead to a large change in @xmath1 at back angles . at the 30 deg .",
    "angle of the bates experiment the mft plane wave calculation is about 1 % above the equal density plane wave result .",
    "coulomb distortions increase @xmath1 by another two % .",
    "thus the full calculation is about 3 % above the original prediction .",
    "this change is smaller then the bates error .",
    "however , it is large compared to a possible one % standard model test .",
    "we conclude that coulomb distortions must be included in a one % standard model test on @xmath3c or @xmath4o ( indeed fig .",
    "3 shows similar results for @xmath4o ) .",
    "however , we have calculated coulomb distortions accurately so they should pose no problems for the interpretation of the experiment .",
    "we also see that isospin violation ( small differences between proton and neutron densities ) is significant especially at back angles .",
    "this correction involves some nuclear structure uncertainties .",
    "thus isospin violation may limit a standard model test to small momentum transfers .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath1  for @xmath2he at 850 mev .",
    "we assume a 3 parameter fermi charge density , see table i. for this light target , coulomb distortions are only important in the diffraction minima .",
    "the solid curve is for a neutron density arbitrarily one % smaller then the proton density .",
    "this change in @xmath57 is somewhat bigger then theoretical estimates .",
    "however , there is great sensitivity to small changes in the neutron density",
    ". an accurate microscopic calculation of @xmath58 using greens function monte carlo or other methods is very important .",
    "we note that the solid curve crosses the dashed curve just beyond 50 degrees .",
    "this is near the second maximum in the form factor and corresponds to the kinematics of a planned experiment [ 2 ] . at this momentum transfer , @xmath49",
    ", the derivative of the cross section with @xmath49 goes to zero which reduces some systematic errors ( such as those from helicity correlated changes in @xmath49 ) .",
    "one can think of the derivative as being with respect to the dimension - less quantity @xmath59 with @xmath60 the nuclear radius .",
    "thus the derivative of the cross section with respect to @xmath60 also vanishes at the same point .",
    "this implies that the cross section and asymmetry will be insensitive to small changes in @xmath60 or @xmath58 .",
    "this minimizes the sensitivity to isospin violation .",
    "however the sensitivity is large at other momentum transfers .",
    "results for @xmath1 in @xmath47pb at 850 mev are shown in fig . 5 at forward angles and in fig . 6 at backward angles .",
    "[ note , all of the curves in these and remaining figures include coulomb distortions . ]",
    "the dotted curve assumes a three parameter fermi charge density and equal weak density .",
    "the solid curve uses relativistic mean field ( mft ) [ 10 ] charge and weak densities .",
    "the large difference between these curves indicates a strong sensitivity to the neutron radius or @xmath58 .",
    "finally , the dashed curve assumes the weak density is a scaled ( stretched ) version of the ( three parameter fermi ) charge density , @xmath61 \\lambda^3   \\rho(\\lambda r).\\eqno(11)\\ ] ] the scale parameter @xmath62 is chosen to reproduce the mft @xmath58 .",
    "these various densities are shown in fig . 7 .",
    "root mean square radii are collected in table ii .",
    "the good agreement between the dashed and solid curves in fig . 5 indicates that a forward angle measurement is primarily sensitive to the neutron radius and not to shell structure in the density ( see fig .",
    "the scaled three parameter fermi density is very different from the mft at small @xmath60 .",
    "the nucleus @xmath63ba provides a meeting ground between nuclear and atomic physics .",
    "there is interest in an atomic parity violation experiment on the ba ion . at the same time , @xmath63ba has a relatively simple nuclear structure and a large gap of about 1.5 mev to the first excited state .",
    "[ unfortunately cs isotopes have relatively complicated nuclear structure and low first excited states . ]",
    "thus ba may be a good place to measure both the neutron radius ( with electron scattering ) and atomic parity violation .",
    "figure 8 shows mft weak and charge densities for @xmath63ba and fig .",
    "9 presents parity violating asymmetries .",
    "the sensitivity to the neutron radius is large , comparable to pb .",
    "alternatively , one may be able to accurately calibrate nuclear theory with a measurement of @xmath58 in @xmath47pb and then use theory to interpolate to other nuclei of interest in atomic physics . in a latter paper",
    "we will discuss both the absolute errors in nuclear theory and the relative errors in going from one nucleus to another .",
    "it should be possible to achieve the needed one percent relative error .",
    "thus one may be able to understand bulk neutron radii throughout the periodic table with only a single measurement .    from a nuclear structure point of view alone ,",
    "an obvious choice is @xmath47pb since this is such a good doubly closed shell nucleus with a simple structure , a high first excited state , a large cross section and a large neutron excess .",
    "we also show in figs .",
    "10 and 11 predictions for @xmath64ca since this nucleus has a large fractional neutron excess .",
    "again , there is a large sensitivity to the neutron radius .",
    "however , the cross section for @xmath64ca is smaller then for @xmath47pb .",
    "we now discuss the optimal kinematics for an experiment on @xmath47pb . the figure of merit , @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "12 for 850 mev .",
    "this is strongly forward peaked since the cross section falls rapidly with angle .",
    "thus experiments may only be feasible at forward angles .",
    "figure 5 suggests one is sensitive to the neutron density at scattering angles near 6 and 12 degrees in the lab .",
    "this is made quantitative in fig .",
    "13 where we plot the logarithmic derivative of the asymmetry with respect to the scale factor of the neutron density , @xmath66  of eq . 11 ( equivalently with respect to the neutron radius ) , @xmath67 note , this is evaluated at @xmath62 .",
    "the logarithmic derivative peaks around 3.2 near 7 degrees and around 10 near 14 degrees . a value of 3.2 means that a 3.2 percent measurement of @xmath1  could determine the neutron radius to one percent ( if other uncertainties are small ) .    the product of the figure of merit and the logarithmic derivative is also shown in fig .",
    "this is large where @xmath1 can be accurately measured and is sensitive to the neutron radius .",
    "the first maximum in this product ( near 4 degrees ) is about 20 times the second maximum ( near 12 degrees ) .",
    "figure 12 is for a fixed beam energy of 850 mev .",
    "results can be approximately scaled to other energies , @xmath13 , by multiplying the cross section ( at fixed momentum transfer ) by ( @xmath13/850 mev)@xmath68 .",
    "for example , an experiment at a fixed laboratory angle of six degrees is illustrated in fig .",
    "note , this is an approximate figure since it is based on distortion calculations at 850 mev scaled to other energies .",
    "however , it should provide a good first orientation .",
    "a measurement at six degrees is possible in hall a at jefferson lab . with a septum magnet .",
    "figure 14 has local maxima near 730 , 1720 and 2600 mev .",
    "the product of figure of merit times log .",
    "derivative is a factor of 3.8 ( 15 ) lower at 1720 ( 2600 ) mev then at 730 mev .",
    "a measurement near 730 mev is insensitive to possible uncertainties in the surface thickness ( of the neutron density ) .",
    "however , the surface thickness may be well known from theory where it is constrained by the surface energy .",
    "a measurement near 1720 mev is more sensitive to the neutron radius ( see fig .",
    "13 ) so it may be less sensitive to other corrections or errors",
    ". therefore it would be very useful to measure both points .",
    "however , most of the information on the neutron radius can be extracted from a single measurement .",
    "if pushed for time , it is most important to make a single accurate measurement ( then two less accurate ones ) .",
    "in this paper we have calculated parity violating asymmetries for elastic electron scattering including coulomb distortions . we solve a relativistic optical model for electron scattering in vector and axial - vector potentials .",
    "a series of plane wave and cross section checks give us confidence in the numerical results .",
    "our most important conclusion is that a parity violation experiment to measure the neutron density in a heavy nucleus is feasible .",
    "possible targets include @xmath47pb because of its simple structure , good closed shells , and large neutron excess or @xmath63ba because of the overlap of atomic physics interest and a relatively simple nuclear structure .",
    "it is straight forward to optimize the kinematics of such an experiment .",
    "however , one must include the large effects of coulomb distortions .",
    "one possibility for @xmath47pb is to measure around six degrees and an energy near 750 and or 1700 mev",
    ". we would be happy to provide more detailed calculations upon request .",
    "future atomic parity experiments will require accurate knowledge of the neutron radius . in a later paper ,",
    "we explore how a single good electron scattering measurement , coupled with the many constraints of nuclear theory , should be enough to predict the neutron radius to one percent for all closed shell nuclei .",
    "note , determining small differences between isotopes is clearly more demanding .",
    "however , an understanding of bulk neutron radii is still an important first step towards a theory of isotope differences",
    ".    a measurement of the neutron radius will also provide fundamental nuclear structure information .",
    "it would be the first accurate and model independent measurement of the _ size _ of large hadronic systems .",
    "note , the size does not follow directly from the charge radius because of the neutron skin .",
    "the measurement will provide important constraints on the isospin dependence of the nuclear matter energy functional and should constrain parameters such as the surface symmetry energy and or the isovector incompressibility .",
    "we have found that coulomb distortions are also important for a one percent standard model test in @xmath3c or @xmath4o .",
    "however , we have calculated distortions accurately so they should not pose a problem in the interpretation of an experiment .",
    "small differences between proton and neutron radii are also important for elastic experiments involving @xmath69he , @xmath3c and @xmath4o",
    ". microscopic calculations of the difference between neutron and proton radii in @xmath69he or @xmath4o would be very useful .",
