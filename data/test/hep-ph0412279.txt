    "measurements of lepton pair production in hadron - hadron interactions is of a big interest from the point of view of study of the quark - parton structure of hadrons @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the best example is the discovery of j ( also called as j / psi ) charmed meson confirmed later by e+e- experiment tool to get out the information about the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) in hadrons as it was already shown in a number of high energy experiments @xcite and theoretical papers , devoted to the data analysis in the framework of qcd . in this connection it is worth to mention that up to now",
    "there is no good theoretical understanding of the physics of this process .",
    "the best example of this situation is the wide use of such a `` theoretical method '' of elimination of quite a noticeable discrepancy among the lepton pair production data and the theory predictions ( quark - parton model and its qcd extensions ) as a simple multiplication of the theory predictions by the so called phenomenological `` k - factors '' which values vary in the interval from 1.5 to 2 .",
    "intermediate energy experiments may play an important role as they allow to study the range where the perturbative methods of qcd ( pqcd ) come into the interplay with a rich physics of bound states .",
    "the physics of hadron resonances formation and decays is strongly connected with the confinement problem , i.e. with the qcd dynamics at large distances .",
    "its high precision and detail experimental study would allow to make a serious discrimination between a large variety of non - perturbative approaches and models that are already proposed as well as among those which are under development .",
    "therefore to define a boundary among perturbative and non - perturbative approaches it may be instructive to make some estimations on kinematical distributions , connected with the @xmath1- or @xmath2- pairs production in the range of future panda experiment energies basing upon the well known pythia @xcite event generator , which is widely and successfully used in high energy experiments . such an experience may allow to set the low energy limits for pqcd application as well as it may be also useful for comparison with the predictions of the present ( and future ) non - perturbative approaches and finding out their difference .",
    "it is worth to mention also that in any case the dominant mechanism of the lepton - anti - lepton pair production would be the same in the most approaches because in this special process @xmath3 the dominant contribution in any model would come from the same quark pair annihilation amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "pythia includes this amplitude as well as proper account of relativistic kinematics    to this reason , in present note we shall simulate in framework of pythia6 the scattering of the anti - protons with the energy of @xmath5 on the proton target , taken as to be at the rest frame thus the present simulation would not include the effects connected with the real detector conditions which would be the subject of the following papers .",
    "thus , the present simulation has the importance as its own because it gives in some sense the `` unbiased distributions '' of particles as well as the corresponding quark - parton distributions and allows , in principle , to estimate the size of the corrections needed to reconstruct the original input parton distributions .",
    "let us mention that in what follows we choose mrst4 @xcite parameterization of structure functions , which is one from the list of proton parton - distributions set of pythia6 .",
    "it should be noted also that the main part of this note ( sections 1 . and 2 .",
    ") can be easily applied to a case of electron - positron pair production .",
    "the main difference of @xmath2 case with that one of muon pair production is that for @xmath2 case there would not a big need of discussion of appearance of fake electrons in the same `` signal '' annihilation event due to negligibly small contribution of fake electrons from pions decays as comparing with their muon decay channel .",
    "here we present some distributions of muon physical variables obtained by use of pythia event generator .",
    "its parameters were set to those values that allow fast simulation for the antiproton beam with the energy @xmath7=14 gev , which corresponds to the center of mass frame energy of @xmath8 collision @xmath9 .",
    "the muons produced in the corresponding hard qcd @xmath10 subprocess @xmath11 would be called in what follows as the `` signal '' ones , while those which will appear in event due to meson decays would be called as `` decay '' muons .",
    "the simulation was done for a case when both initial state radiation ( isr ) and final one ( fsr ) were switched on ( i.e. with the following values of pythia parameters mstp(61)= mstp(71)=1 ) .",
    "the number of generated events was taken to be 100 000 .",
    "the distributions of the signal muons energy @xmath12 values as well as of the modulus of the transverse momentum @xmath13 and of the polar angle @xmath14 ( measured from the beam direction ) versus the number of generated events are shown ( from top to bottom , respectively ) in figure 1 of section 6 , which contains all the figures .",
    "the left column in figure 1 is for @xmath15 distributions and the right one for @xmath16 ) .",
    "there is no difference seen between @xmath16 and the analogous e @xmath15 distributions in a case when the influence of magnetic field is not considered ) .",
    "one can see from the top raw of figure 1 that the energy of muons may vary in the interval @xmath17 with a mean value @xmath18 gev and a peak at a rather small value @xmath19 = 0.5 gev .",
    "the @xmath20 spectrum , see middle raw of figure 1 , has an analogous peak @xmath21 gev / c .",
    "after this point both @xmath22 and @xmath20 spectra falls rather steeply but the spectrum of @xmath20 is confined in a more narrow interval @xmath23 gev / c .",
    "the spectrum of events number ( nevent ) versus the polar angle @xmath24 ( see bottom raw ) has a peak at @xmath25 and the mean value @xmath26 .    from these plots we see that while the most of signal muons are scattered into the forward direction @xmath27 still there is a small number of them that fly in the backward hemisphere ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we shall discuss this point in more details in what follows .",
    "from the view point of the background ( the main source for it are the muons from charged pions and other hadrons decays ) estimation it is usefull to have the set of plots analogouse to the previouse one , but done separatley for the signal muons having the largest energy ( `` fast '' muons ) in the muon pair produced in an event , and , correspondently , for those having the smaller energy ( `` slow '' muon ) .",
    "this set of plots for the signal muons are given in figure 2 of the appendix , where the left column is for the `` slow '' muon distributions and the right one is for `` fast '' muons .",
    "we see from figure 2 that the energy spectrum ( top raw ) of the fast signal muons grows steeply from the point @xmath29 ( practically @xmath30 of fast muons have @xmath31 ) to the peak at the point @xmath32 = @xmath33 and then vanishes at @xmath34 = @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast to this picture the spectrum of less energetic signal munons ( left raw ) has a peak at the point @xmath36=0.5 gev ( where the spectrum of fast muons only starts ) and it practicaly vanishes at the point , which corresponds to the mean value of the most energetic signal muons , i.e. to @xmath37 = 3.9 gev .",
    "thus , one may say that the spectrum of slow muons in a pair is very different from that of the fast ones .",
    "the difference between the @xmath20 spectra ( see middle raw of figure 2 ) of the fast and slow muons seams not to be so large and it results only in about 340 mev shift to the left of the peak position as well in the corresponding shift of the end point of slow muons spectrum . both of these spectra demonstrait that the most of slow as well as of fast muons have @xmath38 gev .",
    "this similarity of @xmath20 spectra of fast and slow muons results ( due to a large difference of their energy spectra , i.e. of @xmath39 compronent ) in a large difference of their polar angle @xmath24 distributions ( see bottom raw in figure 2 ) : @xmath40 spectrum is shifted to the right as comparinring to that one for @xmath41 and their mean value @xmath42 = @xmath43 is a more than two times higher than the analogouse mean value for the fast one : @xmath44 .",
    "another and the most important difference that is seen from these angular distributions is that all fast muons fly in forward direction @xmath45 and their spectrum practically finishes at @xmath46 , while about @xmath47 of slow muons have @xmath48 and about of @xmath49 of them may scatter into the back hemisphere .",
    "up to now we disscussed the results obtained without any other kinematical cuts than those implemented onto internal pythia varaibles and needed to run this generator at as low as possible values of beam energy . in our generation",
    "we have restricted the value of the invariant mass of @xmath1 signal pair , produced in event . namely we have taken the last parameter @xmath50 to be restricted by the inequality @xmath51 gev .",
    "the distributions of bjorken x - variables are shown in figure 3 for up- and antiup- quarks ( top raw ) and for down- and antidown- quarks ( bottom raw ) correspondingly . in what follows",
    "we shall refer to these distributions as to the `` unbiased '' ones as the influence of different cuts onto muons energy @xmath52 as well as the angle cuts , connected with possible different geometry size of muon muon system would be studied latter .",
    "as it can be easialy seen from this plots the obtained distributions do not start from the point x=0 , what take place for the used parton distribution parametrizations used in pythia .",
    "such a differnce at low values of x appears due to the mention above cut on the value of muon pair invariant mass .",
    "the number of entries at these plots reflects the valence quark flavour structure of the proton ( the analoguse distributions and the number of entries for the antiquarks show the absolute similarity of quark and antiquarks distributions ) .",
    "all what was said above may be to a good approximation applied also to a case of electron - positron pair production in the final state .",
    "the most difference of @xmath2 case with that one of @xmath53 pair production appears , as it was allready mentioned in the introduction , when one turns to the problem of background or fake leptons in the same signal lepton pair production process .",
    "really , the events with a pair of signal muons should contain also some hadrons in the final state .",
    "the pions , produced directly or in the decays cascades of other hadrons , may decay in the detector volume and thus serve as a source of background muons that may fake the signal ones produced in the annihilation subprocess .",
    "figure 4 includes in the left column ( as in the figures 1 and 2 ) the distributions ( from top to bottom ) of the number of events versus the energy @xmath54= @xmath55 , the transverse momentum @xmath56 = @xmath57 and versus the polar angle @xmath58= @xmath59 of produced pions .",
    "the right hand column contains only one plot with the distribution of the total number npi of charged @xmath60-mesons in the signal events .",
    "one may see that there is a big number of events ( about@xmath61 ) which do not contain charged pions at all in the final state ( they mostly have nucleon pairs in the final state ) .",
    "this result is very important . despite the fact that pythia provides a good ( at least one of the bests if not the best one ) but still a model approximation to the real hadronization effects , it indicates ( in the absence of a complete physical and theoretical understanding of parton to hadrons fragmentation processes ) that it may happen so that about of one third of events with signal muon pairs may appear practically without additional fake ( or internal background ) decay muons content .",
    "that means that muon channel may be quite competitive to the @xmath2 one .",
    "in what follows we shall add more arguments in a favor of this suggestion .",
    "from the same right hand plot we also see that about of @xmath62 of events have only one charged pion in the final state ( appearing mostly in @xmath63 resonance decays ) , and a bit less than @xmath62 of events have two charged pions .",
    "it demonstrates also that about of @xmath49 of events have 3 charged pions and there is only about of @xmath64 of events with 4 final state charged pions .",
    "figure 5 includes in the left column , respectively from top to bottom , the energy @xmath65 , @xmath66 and polar angle @xmath67 distributions for muons appearing from the discussed above charged @xmath60 -meson decays .",
    "these distributions follow the analogue spectra of parent pions , presented in figure 4 .    by comparing these plots with those from signal muon pairs shown in figure 1",
    ", one may conclude that the energy mean value of the signal muons @xmath68 = 2.6 gev does corresponds to the point in the energy distribution of fake decay muons where the contribution of the decay muons is already low .",
    "the same may be said about the pt- distribution of decay muons .",
    "the mean value of the pt- distribution of signal muons @xmath69 gev ( see figure 1 ) does corresponds to the point where the spectrum of @xmath70 practically vanishes .    the e- and",
    "pt- spectra of decay muons are a bit softer than those of `` slow '' signal ones .",
    "they are shifted by 300 mev ( i.e. by @xmath71 to the left ( see their mean values ) as comparing with those of signal slow muons .",
    "analogously the fake decay muons polar angle spectrum is shifted also to the left by @xmath61 , i.e. by @xmath72 . still , due to a big similarity of decay and `` slow''signal muons",
    "the former may appear as a serious background .",
    "therefore a reasonable cut upon the muons energy @xmath73 ( as well as on the @xmath74 ) may lead to an essential reduction of the decay mesons contribution and allow to keep the main part of signal events .",
    "thus a cut @xmath75 gev may allow to get rid of a half of decay mesons at the coast of lost of @xmath76 of signal events . the analogous strict cut @xmath77gev leaves more than @xmath78 of signal muons and less than @xmath79 of decay mesons .    another way to discriminate the signal `` slow '' muons from the decay ones is to use the information about the position of the muon production vertex .",
    "the right hand side raw in figure 5 contains ( from top to bottom ) the x- , y- and z-(i.e . along the beam direction ) components of muon production vertex position , as given by pythia simulation , i.e. in a space free of experimental setup around the interaction point .",
    "the distances at these distribution plots are given in millimeters .",
    "thus one may see that the tails of the z - distribution may expand up to 100 meters , while those along x- and y- axis reach 40 meters distance . from this right hand plots it is clearly seen that in a case of mentioned above @xmath80 of signal events that include the decay muons ( i.e. addition to the signal muon pair , produced in annihilation subprocess ) the size of the detector ( i.e. , the `` decay volume '' ) may strongly reduce the number of charged @xmath60-mesons which potentially may produce muons in the decays because the most of parent pions would interact with the detector components . therefore one may expect that in the real experimental conditions the situation with the contribution of the additional decay muons may become much easy . the detailed geant simulation , which is in our nearest plans , should allow to get more definite predictions about the decay mesons contribution to the background .",
    "the energy , transverse momenta and polar angle ( with respect to the beam axis ) distributions of muons that may be produced in pairs in @xmath3 process , i.e. the distributions of signal muons , are presented for a case of the proton target rest frame .",
    "these distributions were obtained by use of pythia generator which parameters were adjusted to perform effective generation of physical events in a case of @xmath81 beam energy equal to 14 gev .",
    "it is shown that those of muons that are the most energetic in a moun pair , i.e. fast muons , predominantly fly in forward direction ( with the mean value @xmath44 ) , while those which are less energetic in a pair , i.e. slow muons , fly at larger angles ( their mean value is @xmath42 = @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is found that some of slow signal muons may fly in backward hemisphere also .",
    "thus , a good angle coverage by muon system would be very usefull .",
    "the analogous distributions for muons that appear from hadrons decays ( mostly from pions ) , i.e. for decay muons , have shown that decay muons may fake the signal slow muons in the same events and thus , in principle , may be considered to appear as a serious bakground .",
    "nevertheless , the distributions of the number of generated events versus the number of charged pions in lepton pair production event has shown that , fortunatly , more than @xmath61 of signal events do not have charged pions in the final state . on a top of this",
    "it seams to be clear from the obtained distribution of the space position of fake decay muon production vertex that a large amount of these muons may be potentialy rejected with the account of the real detector decay volume .",
    "we plan as our next step to perform such type of complete geant detector simulation with the analysed here events , generated by use of pyhtia .",
