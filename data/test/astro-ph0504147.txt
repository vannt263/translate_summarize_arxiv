    "the formation of diffuse radio regions ( radio halos or relics ) detected so far in a limited number of clusters of galaxies seems due to large - scale shocks and turbulence associated to gravitational mergers of subclusters and groups able to provide the necessary ingredients , namely , magnetic field amplification and particle reacceleration ( tribble 1993 ; brunetti 2001 ; fujita , takizawa , & sarazin 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , the megaparsec - scale of radio halos or relics combined with the relatively short radiative lifetimes of the electrons ( @xmath4 yrs ) suggests an in - situ electron reacceleration induced by very recent or current merger events whose link with diffuse radio emission seems to be evidenced by x - ray observations ( markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 ; govoni 2004 ) .",
    "the existence of these radio regions could be related to the origin of hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission which has been detected in a few clusters thanks to the sensitivity and wide spectral coverage of and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( ) .",
    "a hxr excess has been measured in the coma cluster by and ( fusco - femiano 1999 ; rephaeli , gruber , & blanco 1999 ) and recently confirmed by combining the spectrum of the first /phoswich detection system ( pds ; frontera 1997a ) observation with the spectrum obtained with a second deeper observation ( fusco - femiano 2004 ) .",
    "the results of these detections have been challenged by the data analysis of rossetti & molendi ( 2004 ; thereafter rm04 ) .",
    "the origin of this difference is currently under investigation .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "2 we examine the systematic effects reported in their paper and the possible systematic error in the net count rates , discussed in nevalainen ( 2004 ; thereafter ne04 ) , due to unresolved point sources present in the field of view ( fov ) of the pds .",
    "the flux derived from the combined spectrum of the coma cluster , @xmath5 in the 2080 kev energy range , is consistent with the value of @xmath6 measured by the in the same energy band and confirmed by a second deeper observation ( rephaeli & gruber 2002 ) .",
    "non - thermal radiation has been detected also in a2256 by and ( fusco - femiano 2000 ; rephaeli & gruber 2003 ) and a2319 by ( gruber & rephaeli 2002 ) . at a lower confidence level , with respect to coma and a2256 , hxr radiation has been detected by in a754 ( fusco - femiano 2003 ) .",
    "an upper flux limit has been reported in a3667 ( fusco - femiano 2001 ) , a119 ( fusco - femiano 2003 ) and a2163 ( feretti 2001 ) .",
    "a component is detected at a @xmath22@xmath3 level in @xmath250% of the non - significantly agn - contaminated clusters observed by ( ne04 ) .",
    "the most likely interpretation of the nonthermal hxr radiation is inverse compton ( ic ) emission by the same radio synchrotron electrons responsible for the extended radio emission present in all of the mentioned clusters , scattering the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "it is well know that the alternative interpretation based on bremsstrahlung emission from suprathermal electrons ( kaastra , bleeker , & mewe 1998 ; ensslin , lieu , & biermann 1999 ; sarazin & kempener 2000 ) has remarkable energetic problems ( petrosian 2002 ) .",
    "another possible explanation for the detected emission may be due to a significant contamination by obscured agns ( matt 1999 ; hasinger 2001 ) .",
    "however , the observatory that is sensitive enough to probe a significant fraction of the obscured agn has not detected such sources in several clusters ( e.g. molnar 2002 ) .",
    "besides , the co - added spectrum of the sample of clusters in ne04 gives indication for an extended distribution of the emission against a significant contamination from obscured agn .    in this letter",
    ", we present the combined pds spectrum of abell 2256 obtained by summing the spectrum of a second long observation of @xmath2 300 ks with that of the previous shorter observation of @xmath2 130 ks .",
    "the two observations both confirm the presence of hxr radiation from the cluster in excess of the thermal emission measured by the medium - energy concentrator / spectrometer ( mecs ) in the energy range @xmath22 - 10 kev . throughout this letter",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath7 = 70  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8  @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that an angular distance of @xmath11 corresponds to 65.7 kpc ( @xmath12 ; struble & rood 1991 ) .",
    "quoted confidence intervals are at @xmath13 confidence level ( c.l . ) , if not otherwise specified .",
    "abell 2256 was observed for the first time in february 1998 and then in february 1999 for a total of @xmath2130 ks ( obs1 ) and re - observed in july 2001 for @xmath2300 ks ( obs2 ) .",
    "the pointing coordinates of are at j(2000 ) : @xmath14 ; @xmath15 .",
    "the total effective exposure times of the pds in the two observations were 70.1 ks and 190.3 ks , respectively .",
    "the pds spectra of both the observations were extracted using the xas v2.1 package ( chiappetti & dal fiume 1997 ) . the background sampling was performed by making use of the default rocking law of the two pds collimators that samples on/+off , on/off fields for each collimator with a dwell time of 96 sec ( frontera 1997a ) .",
    "when one collimator is pointing on source , the other collimator is pointing toward one of the two off positions .",
    "we used the standard procedure to obtain pds spectra ( dal fiume et al .",
    "1997 ) .    for both obs1 and obs2 the + off and -off count rate spectra",
    "are consistent with each other , with differences equal to @xmath16 counts s@xmath8 and @xmath17 counts s@xmath8 in the two observations , respectively . the marginal evidence ( below 2@xmath3 ) for the presence of contaminating sources in the + off field in obs2 implies to consider the average of the two background measurements in order to have a more conservative determination of the confidence level of the excess with respect to the thermal emission .",
    "the background level for obs1 is 19.50@xmath180.03 counts s@xmath8 in the 15 - 100 kev energy range , while for obs2 is 16.68@xmath180.01 counts s@xmath8.20% variation in the pds background is due to the orbital decay : the lower orbit for obs2 increased the shielding to ambient particles , therefore lowering the diffuse background .",
    "] we have examined the presence of the instrumental background residual reported in rm04 , obtained by these authors analysing the spectra of 15 `` blank fields '' .",
    "this residual is instead not found by ne04 .",
    "we started from the complete sample of 868 pds pointings with galactic latitude @xmath19 , and selected the 15100 kev net count spectra for which there is source detection below 1@xmath3 ( that is , `` blank fields '' ) .",
    "we summed together these spectra ( total exposure @xmath2 2.4 ms ) imposing a net exposure greater than 10  ksec , and found a net count rate of @xmath20 , consistent with the definition of `` blank field '' ( details in landi 2005 ) .",
    "we have then investigated the possible systematic differences between the two background fields @xmath18off .",
    "rm04 analyse 69 observations chosen only on the base of a long exposure and high galactic latitude .",
    "they find that the mean value @xmath21 is significantly different from zero .",
    "analyzing a larger sample , ne04 report evidence for a systematic instrumental residual which cancels out in the standard usage of both offsets . in agreement with ne04 ,",
    "our analysis on the _ whole _ sample of pds observations gives a value of @xmath22 , consistent with no contamination at all .",
    "finally , using our pds blank field sample , we examined the possibility of not significantly detected point source fluctuation ( @xmath23 ) between the offsets . the resulting value @xmath24 ( ) @xmath25 is consistent with that in ne04 .",
    "since the value is also consistent with zero , we assume in the following that this background component is absent in a2256 observations .      in fig .",
    "1 we report the pds and mecs spectra obtained by summing the spectra of the two observations .",
    "the pds background subtracted combined count rate is 0.154@xmath180.011 counts s@xmath8 in the 15 - 100 kev energy range at the confidence level of @xmath26 .",
    "the pds data of the first observation has been reanalyzed using the same procedure utilized for the second longer observation .",
    "the mecs spectrum is in the range @xmath22 - 10 kev obtained from a circular region of 8@xmath27 corresponding to about 0.5 mpc centered on the primary emission peak .",
    "the pspc radial profile indicates that @xmath28 of the total cluster emission falls within this radius ( see fusco - femiano 2000 for details regarding mecs data reduction , the cross - correlation between mecs and pds and results for only obs1 ) .",
    "the total exposure time is 386.4 ks .",
    "the spectral analysis of the mecs data alone gives a temperature of kt = 7.57@xmath29 kev using the mekal code on the xspec package , while the simultaneous fit to the mecs and pds data gives 7.65@xmath180.17 kev ( the mecs and pds normalizations are treated as free parameters ) .",
    "this value of the temperature is consistent with the measurements of ( 7.32 - 7.70 kev ; hatsukade 1989 ) with a field of view comparable to that of the pds , mpc ( 6.7 - 8.1 kev ; david 1993 ) , gis ( 6.78 - 7.44 kev ; henriksen 1999 ) and with the more recent joint analysis of and ( pca & hexte ) data ( 7.66@xmath18 0.12 kev ; rephaeli & gruber 2003 ) . has reported several emission regions giving evidence for the presence of a merger event ( sun 2002 ) .",
    "these detections show temperature variations with a mean value of 6.7@xmath180.2 kev in the central @xmath30 square .",
    "also the flux of @xmath31 in the 2 - 10 kev energy range measured by is consistent with previous observations .",
    "the iron abundance is 0.29@xmath32 , in agreement with the results ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of an excess with respect to the thermal emission in the spectrum of a2256 is evidenced a ) by the fit to the pds data alone in the 1580 kev energy range with a thermal component that determines a temperature of 14.6@xmath33 kev well above the average gas temperature given by in the interval 7.32 - 7.70 kev ( david 1993 ) ; b ) by the fit to the pds data alone with a bremsstrahlung component at the fixed temperature of 7.6 kev , derived by the mecs data alone , that gives an unacceptable @xmath34 value of 3.96 ( = 31.69/8 d.o.f . ) . the nature of this excess results by fitting the pds data with two thermal components , one of these at the fixed temperature of 7.6 kev . for the second component",
    "we obtain an unrealistic temperature greater than @xmath230 kev . in the joint mecs&pds data analysis",
    "the introduction of a second component , modelled as a power law , allows to obtain an improvement of the @xmath34 value that is significant at more than the 99.99% confidence level , according to the _ f_-test ( 198.51/[175 d.o.f . ]",
    "vs 176.96/[173 d.o.f . ] ) .",
    "the presence of the component has the effect of slightly decreasing the best - fit value of the temperature ( 7.32@xmath180.18 kev ) with respect to the temperature obtained by considering only the mecs data .",
    "the confidence contours of the parameter _ kt _ and photon spectral index ( _ @xmath35 _ ) show that , at a 90% confidence level , the temperature is well determined , 7.1 - 7.7 kev , while _",
    "@xmath35 _ describes a large interval of 0.3 - 1.8 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the contribution of the component to the thermal flux in the 2 - 10 kev energy range is @xmath36 for _ @xmath35 _ @xmath371.8 . in the 2080 kev energy band",
    "the excess with respect to the thermal component derived from the mecs and pds data is at level of @xmath38 ( see table 1 ) considering the average of the two background measurements .",
    "the uncertainties in the thermal flux prediction , reported in table 1 , are obtained considering the variations of the gas temperature in the 90% c.l .",
    "range that imply variations of @xmath39 for the level of the excess .",
    "the flux of the component , @xmath40 in the 20 - 80 kev energy range , is obtained by fixing the photon spectral index ( _ @xmath35 _ ) at the best - fit value of @xmath21.5 .",
    "the flux error is derived by varying the pds normalization within the 90% c.l . range .",
    "the two separate observations obs1 and obs2 show an hard excess of @xmath23.3@xmath3 and @xmath23.7@xmath3 , respectively , and the fluxes are consistent with each other ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the difference in the confidence level of the excess between that shown here for obs1 and the one presented in fusco - femiano ( 2000 ) is mainly due to a more conservative procedure for the background subtraction and for the bad events rejection of the pds data ( details in landi 2005 ) .",
    "the combined spectrum of two observations performed with a time interval of @xmath22.5 yr confirms the presence in abell 2256 of a hxr component in excess of the thermal emission at a @xmath24.8@xmath3 confidence level .",
    "the flux of @xmath41 in the energy range 20 - 80 kev is consistent with the published value of the first observation @xmath42 ( fusco - femiano 2000 ) .",
    "the joint data analysis of /pca&hexte and /gis&sis observations ( rephaeli & gruber 2003 ) yields evidence for two components in the spectrum .",
    "the secondary component can be either thermal with a low gas temperature , kt@xmath2 1.5 kev , or power law with photon index @xmath2 2.2 with a flux in the 90% confidence error interval of @xmath43 consistent with our detection .",
    "the confidence contours of two thermal components performed using the mecs and pds data ( see fig .",
    "3 ) confirm the origin for the second component in the spectrum of a2256 . at the 90% of confidence the temperature value of the secondary feature",
    "must be greater than @xmath220 kev .",
    "the hottest regions of the cluster shown by the temperature map are at the level of @xmath2 9 kev ( sun 2002 ) .",
    "the combined spectrum confirms also the upper limit of 1.8 for the hxr photon index reported in the first data analysis of obs1 ( fusco - femiano 2000 ) .    as stated in the introduction",
    ", we can not exclude a significant contamination by obscured sources located in the pds fov able to simulate the flux detected in coma and a2256 , but so far the observations seem not to support this interpretation .",
    "the most likely is ic emission by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio diffuse emission present in both the clusters .",
    "an extended radio emission ( halo ) permeates the center of a2256 with a steep radio spectral index of @xmath2 1.8 - 2.0 ( bridle & fomalont 1976 ; rengelink 1997 ) .",
    "this region could be responsible for the second component that was noted by markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997 ) in their spectral analysis of the data in the central r=3@xmath27 spherical bin .",
    "their best - fit favors a power - law model with a photon index of 2.4@xmath180.3 and therefore a component may be present in the soft region of the x - ray spectrum ( details in fusco - femiano 2000 ) . instead",
    ", the probable source of the nonthermal hxr emission detected by , in the framework of the ic model , may be the large and bright relic in the nw region of the cluster at a distance of @xmath44 from the cluster center .",
    "the extent of this relic is estimated to be @xmath21.0@xmath450.6 mpc with a rather uniform spectral index of 0.8@xmath180.1 .",
    "this low value of the radio spectral index indicates a broad reacceleration region , probably the result of the ongoing merger event due to a subcluster shown by the x - ray observations .",
    "in particular , the x - ray image reported in fig .",
    "1 of the paper of sun ( 2002 ) shows that the connection of the nw radio relic with the ongoing merger event seems to be very likely .",
    "the merger is probably still at the early stage ( briel & henry 1994 ) that seems to be confirmed by the temperature variations across the cluster that are not so strong as those expected in a major merger .",
    "this phase of the merger event may explain the hxr and radio synchrotron emissions that are expected only in clusters with recent or current injection of relativistic electrons because of their rather short lifetimes due to radiative losses .",
    "in the hypothesis that the nw relic is the source of the hxr flux , the observations allow to derive an uniform magnetic field of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 = 0.8 ) in the radio region . instead , in the central radio halo a uniform magnetic field of @xmath48 ( @xmath47 = 1.8 ) is derived , assuming a reasonable contribution of @xmath49 by the power - law component detected by to the total x - ray flux in the 2 - 10 kev energy range ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 ) . a further evidence that the origin of the hxr radiation detected by is probably not due to",
    "the central radio halo seems to be given by the inconsistence between the observed radio index ( @xmath47=1.8 ) , that implies a photon index @xmath50 = 2.8 , and the upper limit of the hxr slope of 1.8 ( see fig .",
    "we wish to thank l.feretti for critical reading of the paper , f.frontera for the contribution to the pds data analysis and the referee j.nevalainen for the very useful suggestions .",
