    "strong correlations in electronic systems , and especially competing interactions , can cause mesoscale electronic structure to spontaneously develop . in cuprate superconductors and the related nickelate compounds ,",
    "several locally inhomogenous electronic phases have been proposed , involving charge order , spin order , or both .",
    "several experimental probes corroborate some level of local order , including stm,@xcite neturon scattering,@xcite , nmr@xcite and @xmath2sr studies.@xcite recent experimental advances have made possible the detection of high energy neutron scattering spectra.@xcite there has been much interest in the interpretation of these spectra in the cuprates , especially since the high energy results from neutron scattering on la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lbco ) and yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( ybco ) exhibit universal behavior.@xcite this paper extends the previous work of refs.@xcite to look at a broader range of ordered structures , and also to explore the scattering patterns which are possible at high energies .",
    "it has been suggested , for example , that the high energy magnetic excitations in lbco and ybco may be due to the quantum excitations of stripes.@xcite we have reported elsewhere@xcite that high energy excitations near a quantum critical point ( qcp ) to disordered ladders@xcite can strongly resemble semiclassical excitations , due to the small critical exponent @xmath9 associated with this qcp .",
    "one continuing mystery about the low energy results has been the lack of observed spin satellite peaks in neutron scattering , and also that spin wave cones are rarely observed in the cuprates .",
    "rather , what is often seen in the low energy regime may be more accurately termed `` legs of scattering '' . both of these results have raised questions about a  stripe \" interpretation of the data . we show below that at @xmath10 , satellite peaks for even the most extreme case of square - wave spin stripes have very low intensity , and may not be resolvable without very high experimental resolution .",
    "in addition , although a spin ordered state results in spin wave cones due to goldstone s theorem , the intensity is not always uniform .",
    "rather , the intensity can be gathered on the inner branch of the spin wave cones [ the side nearest @xmath1 ] , or on the outer branch , depending upon the relative strength of the spin coupling across the charge stripes . for this reason , while spin wave cones are always present for ordered spin stripes , they may not yet be resolvable experimentally .",
    "an important point we wish to emphasize is that although stripes are a unidirectional modulation in an otherwise antiferromagnetic texture , they are a fully two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin order , with a 2d magnetic bravais lattice , which gives rise to 2d scattering signals at all energies .",
    "our results never show streaks of scattering in the low energy structure , although streaks are possible in the high energy structure for weak coupling , as we report below .",
    "in this work we concentrate on static stripes and checkerboards as arrays of antiphase domain walls in an otherwise antiferromagnetic texture .",
    "we are interested solely in the response of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics of the charge component which must reside on every domain wall is to renormalize the effective spin couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "we thus use a suitably parametrized heisenberg model to describe the elementary excitations of spin stripes , employing a modulation of the exchange integral to capture the effective spin coupling in a well ordered stripe or checkerboard phase .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the effective spin coupling .",
    "we work in units where @xmath14 .",
    "nearest neighbor couplings are antiferromagnetic with @xmath15 within each antiferromagnetic patch .",
    "couplings across a domain wall are different , and depend upon the configuration ( such as spacing and direction of the domain walls ) .",
    "these are enumerated below . when comparing to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the cuprates ( nickelates ) , our lattice corresponds to the copper ( nickel ) sites within the copper - oxygen ( nickel - oxygen ) planes . with these materials in mind , we restrict ourselves to patterns embedded in a two - dimensional square lattice .      in the presence of a host crystal ,",
    "stripes are constrained by the symmetry of the crystal to run along major crystallographic directions .",
    "we consider two classes of stripe patterns , vertical and diagonal , as well as checkerboard patterns .",
    "these classifications concern the pattern of the antiphase domain walls in the antiferromagnetism .",
    "we use the term `` vertical '' to describe stripes whose domain walls run parallel to the cu - o ( ni - o ) bond direction , and the term `` diagonal '' to describe stripes that run @xmath16 from that direction .",
    "these stripe patterns are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : allstripes ] .",
    "a further distinction between types of stripes and checkerboards depends on where the antiphase domain walls sit with respect to the atomic lattice .",
    "`` site - centered '' stripes have domain walls which are centered on the sites of the square lattice ( _ i.e. _ on the nickel or copper sites ) .",
    "these have antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath17 across the domain wall .",
    "on the other hand , when the domain wall is situated between two square lattice sites ( _ i.e. _ between nickel or copper sites , on the planar oxygens ) , the stripes are `` bond - centered '' . in this case the coupling across the domain wall is effectively ferromagnetic ( to preserve the antiphase nature of the domain walls ) , and @xmath18.@xcite    checkerboard patterns have been proposed to explain the real space structure observed in stm experiments on bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath19@xcite ( bscco ) and ca@xmath3na@xmath4cuo@xmath6cl@xmath6@xcite ( na - ccoc ) .",
    "it is important to note that stm is a surface probe , and to date , the @xmath20 pattern observed in bscco and na - ccoc has not been confirmed by neutron scattering or other bulk probes in these materials .",
    "likewise , the @xmath21 pattern has not yet been confirmed via stm to be present in the lanthanum and yttrium compounds .",
    "nevertheless , it has been noted that the length scale of the charge periodicity observed in bscco and na - ccoc via stm is half that of the spin periodicity found in neutron scattering in related lanthanum - based and yttrium - based cuprate superconductors , and that therefore the two probes may be observing similar charge and spin modulations .",
    "since the neutron scattering shows satellite peaks around antiferromagnetism , rather than a peak at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath1 , any universal spin texture which is consistent with the proposed checkerboard pattern must also incorporate antiphase domain walls in the corresponding spin texture .",
    "representative , simple spin checkerboard configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : checkerbond ] .",

    "[ fig.vs4_0.4 ] and  [ fig.vs4_1.0 ] . rather than evidence against stripes ,",

    "another important piece of physics in the cuprates is that the intensity of theresonance peak \" increases below @xmath76 .",
    "however , since we do not explicitly include superconductivity , our model does not address the observed increase in intensity of the resonance peak as superconductivity onsets .",

    "the satellite peaks are easier to detect , with a ratio of at least @xmath39 between the main ic peaks and the next satellite peaks , even for the most extreme case of a square - wave profile . however , this is still below the noise for current experimental resolution .    for vertical stripes at finite but low energies ,",
    "the intensity around the spin wave cones is rarely uniform .",
    "rather , it is shifted either toward or away from the @xmath1 point by an amount which depends on the coupling ratio @xmath42 . for weak coupling across the charge stripes ,",
    "@xmath129 , the weight is gathered on the inner branch toward the @xmath1 peak , indicating that weak stripe coupling may be responsible for the observed  legs \" of scattering in stripe - ordered cuprates at low frequency . for stronger coupling across the charge stripes , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath130 , the intensity shifts to the outer branch . in either case , without sufficient experimental resolution , only part of the spin wave cones will be visible at low energy .    at intermediate energies and for weak coupling ,",
    "the acoustic band displays a saddlepoint whose intensity profile mimics that of the  resonance peak \" observed in cuprate superconductors . for twinned stripes",
    ", a saddlepoint displays the characteristic hourglass shape in @xmath101 _ vs. _ @xmath43 plots seen in some experiments , with both low and high energy legs emanating from a resonance - like peak.@xcite    at high energies and weak coupling @xmath75 , vertical stripes show a square - shaped continuum which is rotated @xmath16 from the low energy ic peaks .",
    "as we have shown previously,@xcite very weak coupling captures the spin wave excitations of stripe - ordered lbco at all measured energies , and at higher energies it bears a striking resemblance to the high energy excitations of ybco .",
    "the gap to spin @xmath131 excitations in ybco is likely due to the stripes being too weakly coupled , and therefore quantum disordered .",
    "however , at high energy , the quantum critical excitations@xcite strongly resemble the spin waves studied here , which may be due to the proximity of a qcp with small critical exponent @xmath9.@xcite near the qcp , one way to distinguish semiclassical spin waves from quantum critical excitations is through the lineshapes . whereas semiclassical spin waves produce a lorentzian lineshape , quantum criticality yields a power law cusp . for intermediate and larger couplings @xmath75 ,",
    "the high energy response can have a variety of shapes .",
    "we have shown here that circular continua are possible , as well as square - shaped continua which either have the same orientation as the low energy peaks , or are rotated @xmath16 from that direction .    for diagonal stripes , as with vertical stripes , the low energy spin wave cones have intensity profiles which depend on the strength of the coupling between the stripes . for weak coupling , the intensity is peaked on the inner branches , while for strong coupling , it is peaked on the outer branches . in either extreme case",
    ", the entire spin - wave cone may not be visible in an experiment without sufficient resolution . at intermediate energy ,",
    "weakly coupled diagonal stripes also have a saddlepoint in the acoustic band , with properties akin to the resonance peak . at high energy ,",
    "weakly coupled diagonal stripes display a high energy square - shaped continuum , rotated @xmath16 from the low energy peaks . at higher coupling ratio @xmath42",
    ", the saddlepoint in the acoustic band at @xmath1 is lost , and a variety of high energy scattering patterns are possible .",
    "diagonal bond - centered stripes of odd spacing display net ferromagnetism , changing the nature of goldstone modes from linear to quadratic in @xmath116 . both site- and bond - centered stripes of even spacing",
    "have magnetic reciprocal lattice vectors which include @xmath132 . because of the antiphase nature of the domain walls , zero frequency is forbidden at this peak , but the ( very low intensity ) spin wave cone emanating from @xmath1 precludes a saddlepoint at @xmath133 in the acoustic band .    for intermediate coupling @xmath134 ,",
    "the expected scattering intensity from diagonal , site - centered stripes of spacing @xmath83 strongly resembles that in la@xmath3sr@xmath4nio@xmath5 at @xmath104 and @xmath105 , as pointed out in ref .",
    "we find for this configuration that while the intensity is peaked on the outer branch of the spin wave cone at low energy , it moves toward the inner branch as energy is increased .",
    "furthermore , the spin wave cones are remarkably circular , despite the anisotropic coupling ratio . with increasing energy ,",
    "the spin wave cones merge , eventually gathering weight at the central peak @xmath1 .",
    "however , rather than a saddlepoint , this coupling has a band edge at @xmath1 .",
    "simple checkerboards , on the other hand , have low energy spin ic peaks rotated @xmath16 from the observed spin peaks in neutron scattering.@xcite in addition , for weak coupling across the domain walls @xmath98 , rather than showing a resonance - like saddlepoint , the acoustic band has a band edge at @xmath1,@xcite and therefore no branches emanating from it at high energy . although the simple checkerboard studied here is incompatible with the experimental data , this does not rule out the possibility of more complicated checkerboard patterns@xcite which may be able to capture the correct orientation of the low energy spin and charge ic peaks .",
