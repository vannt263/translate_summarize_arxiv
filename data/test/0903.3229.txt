    "radiative recombination ( rr ) is one of the basic processes that occurs in many stellar and laboratory plasmas as well as in collisions of heavy ions with electrons at ion storage rings and electron beam ion traps ( ebit ) . in this process , a free ( or quasi ",
    "free ) electron is captured into a bound state of an ion under the simultaneous emission of a photon .",
    "because of their practical importance , detailed rr studies have been carried out during the last two decades for many elements and for a wide range of collision energies . at the gsi storage ring in darmstadt , for example ,",
    "a large number of experiments have been done for the electron capture into bare high@xmath0 ions , giving rise to hydrogen  like ions after the recombination has taken place @xcite . in the earlier experiments ,",
    "the total and angle  differential cross sections have been measured hereby mainly for the ground ",
    "state capture and were found in good agreement with computations based on dirac s equation @xcite . apart from the rr into the @xmath3 ground state , most recent studies have dealt also with the electron capture into the excited ionic states which later decay under the emission of one ( or several ) characteristic photons @xcite .",
    "such a subsequent decay is characterized ( apart from the well known energies ) by its angular distribution and polarization of the emitted photons . both of these properties are closely related to the magnetic sublevel population of the excited ion as it arises from the electron capture .",
    "several experiments have been carried out during last few years in order to study the angular distribution and linear polarization of the subsequent photons and , hence , enabled one to derive the alignment of the residual ions .",
    "for the capture of an electron into the @xmath4 state of a bare uranium ion , for instance , a strong alignment was found especially for the residual ions , both by experiment @xcite and in computations @xcite .    in most experiments on the radiative decay cascades of high@xmath0 ions , that were performed so far ,",
    "the emission of the first , recombination photon remained unobserved .",
    "although some insight about the collisional dynamics and electronic structure of heavy ions can be gained already from such an _ individual _ analysis of the characteristic radiation , more information is obtained , if both , the recombination and decay photons are measured in _",
    "coincidence_. moreover , such photon ",
    "photon coincidence studies may have a significant impact also for the development of novel experimental methods and techniques .",
    "it was recently argued , for example , that they may help to determine the polarization properties of heavy ions beams @xcite , a request which has been recently made by several groups .",
    "information about the ion polarization is required for studying , for example , the parity non  conservation ( pnc ) effects in highly  charged ions or in heavy ",
    "ion collisions @xcite .",
    "despite of the importance of coincidence rr experiments for the forthcoming heavy ion research , little attention was paid up to now to their _ theoretical _ foundation .",
    "a first step towards the theoretical description of the @xmath5 rr process has been done only recently by us in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    ", we have investigated the angle  angle correlations between the recombination and the subsequent decay photons , assuming that the polarization state of the photons remain unobserved .",
    "owing to the recent advances in x  ray polarization techniques @xcite , however , a _ polarization  resolved _ analysis of the correlated photon emission might become feasible in the next few years .    in this contribution",
    ", we study here the polarization correlations between the recombination and the subsequent decay photons in the @xmath5 radiative recombination of bare , high@xmath0 ions .",
    "these correlations can be described most easily in the framework of the density matrix theory , based on dirac s relativistic equation . however , before we shall present details from this theory , we first summarize in section  [ sec_geometry ] the geometry under which the photon  photon polarization correlations are to be considered . in section [ sec_theory ] , then , we make use of the resonance approximation in order to derive the general expression for the double  differential rr cross section which depends on the emission angles and the polarization states of both photons .",
    "starting from this cross section , we perform in section [ sub_section_scenarious ] a theoretical analysis for two selected scenarios of possible x  x coincidence studies .",
    "first , we shall discuss the _ angle  polarization _ correlation in which the linear polarization of the characteristic radiation is explored , while the spin states of recombination photons remain unobserved .",
    "_ vice versa _ , the angular distribution of the characteristic decay photons , following the emission of linearly polarized rr photons , is discussed as a second scenario , then called the _ polarization ",
    "angle _ case .",
    "while , of course , the derived correlation functions can be applied to all hydrogen  like ions , detailed computations have been carried out for the electron capture into the @xmath4 state of initially bare uranium ion , and along with its subsequent lyman@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) decay .",
    "results of our calculations are presented in section [ sec_results ] and indicate strong correlations between the angular and polarization properties of the recombination and decay photons .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "relativistic units @xmath8 are used throughout the paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "in order to explore the polarization correlations in the two  step radiative recombination of ( finally ) hydrogen  like ions , we shall first agree about the geometry under which the emission of both , the recombination and decay photons is observed . in the present work",
    ", the angular and polarization  resolved properties of the photons will be analyzed in the _ projectile frame _",
    "( i.e. the rest frame of the ion ) .",
    "since in this frame the only preferred direction of the overall system is given by the electron momentum , here we adopt the quantization axis ( @xmath9axis ) along the direction of the incoming electron ( as _ seen _ by the ion ) .",
    "together with the wave vector of the first photon @xmath10 , this axis then defines also the reaction plane ( _ x  z _ plane ) .",
    "thus , only one polar angle @xmath11 is required to characterize the first , recombination photon , while the two angles @xmath12 are used for describing the emission of the subsequent decay photon ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    for the theoretical analysis below we have to account for not only the emission angles but also the _ linear _ polarization vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the recombination and decay photons .",
    "as usual , these vectors are defined in the planes that are perpendicular to the photon momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 and are characterized by the angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 with respect to the planes as spanned by the quantization axis and the unit vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "having defined the geometry of the two  step radiative recombination , we are prepared now to derive expression for the differential cross section ( dcs ) of the process .",
    "the evaluation of such cross sections is usually traced back to the rr transition amplitude which , to zeroth order , is described by the diagram shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . in this diagram ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the asymptotic four  momentum and the spin projection of the incoming electron , and @xmath23 denote the four - momenta of the first ( recombination ) and second ( decay ) photon , respectively . by assuming that  for a given energy of the incoming electrons  the x  ray detectors observe only those photons which are emitted in course of ( i ) the electron capture into some ( excited ) ionic state @xmath24 and ( ii ) the @xmath25 subsequent decay to the ground state",
    ", we may restrict our theoretical analysis to the _ resonance approximation _",
    "( cf.ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "within such an approximation , the differential rr cross section reads as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energy and the width of the intermediate ( excited ) state , @xmath29 is the ground  state energy , @xmath30 denotes the velocity of the incident electron in the projectile frame and @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the vector of dirac matrices . in eq .",
    "( [ dcs_general ] ) , moreover , the interaction of the electron with the radiation field is characterized by the operator @xmath33 where the vector potential @xcite @xmath34 describes the plane photon wave with polarization @xmath35 and energy @xmath36 .",
    "owing to the energy conservation @xmath37 only one of the photon energies can be varied independently .",
    "the radiative recombination cross section ( [ dcs_general ] ) is therefore differential in the angle and energy of the second photon but only with regard to the angle of the first photon .",
    "moreover , if we assume the width @xmath28 of the intermediate excited state to be small compared to a distance to other states , we may extend the @xmath38 integration to the interval @xmath39 .",
    "then by making use of the identity @xmath40 we can easily integrate eq .",
    "( [ dcs_general ] ) also over the energy of the second ( decay ) photon and finally obtain the double  differential rr cross section : @xmath41 and where , for the sake of brevity , we have introduced the notation @xmath42 in order to denote the electron  photon interaction operator .      equation  ( [ dcs_general_2 ] ) as derived in the previous section enables one to analyze the _ angular _ and _ polarization _ correlations between the photons emitted in the two  step radiative recombination of ( initially ) bare ions . in order to perform such an analysis ,",
    "it is useful to re  write the doubly  differential rr cross section as : @xmath43 where we assume that incoming electrons are unpolarized and that the spin state of the residual ion remains unobserved . in eq .",
    "( [ dcs_general_3 ] ) , moreover , we have introduced the _ density matrix _ of the intermediate ionic state : @xmath44 this density matrix describes the magnetic sublevel population of the ion after the electron has been captured and the ( first ) rr photon has left the system along the direction @xmath45 . instead of using the density matrix ( [ intermediate_dm ] ) , however , it is often more convenient to represent the intermediate state of the ions in terms of the so  called statistical tensors @xmath46 .",
    "although , from a mathematical viewpoint , the statistical tensors are equivalent to the density matrix , they are constructed to represent the spherical tensors of rank @xmath47 and component @xmath48 ( cf.refs .",
    "@xcite for further details ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denote the clebsch  gordan coefficients . owing to the properties of these coefficients , the tensor components @xmath46 are nonzero only for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in the theory of atomic collisions",
    ", the statistical tensors ( [ stat_tensors ] ) are often re  normalized with respect to the zero ",
    "rank tensor @xcite @xmath53 these reduced tensors ( or _ alignment _ parameters ) are then independent on the particular normalization of the ion density matrix and are directly related to the relative population of the individual substates @xmath24 . by making use of these alignment parameters we may finally write the differential rr cross section as : @xmath54 this cross section still depends on the polarization states and emission angles of both , the recombination and decay photons , because of the dependence of the reduced statistical tensors @xmath55 as well as the bound ",
    "bound transition amplitudes @xmath56 on the angular and polarization properties of the emitted ( first and second - step ) photons .      as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ stat_tensors])([dcs_general_4 ] ) , any further analysis of the angular and polarization correlations between the recombination and subsequent decay photons can be traced back to the free  bound and bound  bound transition amplitudes , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively . since the evaluation of these matrix elements has been discussed in detail elsewhere ( cf .  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , here we just restrict ourselves to a rather short account of the basic relations .",
    "in particular , the evaluation of these matrix elements is significantly simplified if their radial and spin  angular parts are separated from each other . in order to perform such a separation we have to employ the standard ( two  component ) representation of dirac s wavefunction and to _ decompose _ the electron",
    " photon interaction operator ( [ a_definition ] ) into its partial fields .",
    "most naturally , this decomposition can be carried out if we re  write the polarization vector of the photon @xmath35 in terms of two ( linearly independent ) basis vectors @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being the photon helicity ( i.e. the spin projection on the direction of propagation ) , and if we make use of the standard expansion @xcite : @xmath61 for the right ( @xmath62 ) and left  hand ( @xmath63 ) circularly polarized light . in this expression , which has been derived for an arbitrary choice of quantization ( @xmath9 ) axis , @xmath64 represents the wigner rotation matrix and @xmath65 are the usual magnetic and electric multipole fields .    making use of the expansion ( [ a_expansion ] ) and the wigner  eckart theorem",

    "the radial part is in contrast represented by a one  dimensional integral which has to be computed numerically . for the details of these calculations we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bound ",
    "bound transition amplitude , the evaluation of the free  bound matrix elements @xmath67 requires a decomposition not only for the photon plane wave ( [ a_definition ] ) but also for the continuum electron wave which still occurs with well defined asymptotic momentum @xmath68 . as discussed previously @xcite , the particular form of such a decomposition depends on the choice of quantization axis . using , for example , the electron momentum @xmath69",

    "the asymmetric shift in the angular distribution of the characteristic radiation becomes most pronounced for the emission of the recombination photons under the angle @xmath162 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "in this paper , we re  investigated the radiative recombination of a free electron into an excited state of a bare , high  z ion and its subsequent photon decay .",
    "based on the resonant approximation and the density matrix formalism we derived a general expression for the double  differential rr cross section which accounts for both , the angles and the polarization states of the recombination and the subsequent decay photons . by making use of this differential cross section",
    "we studied the polarization and angular correlations between the two emitted photons .",
    "in particular , we analyzed how the linear polarization of the characteristic radiation depends on the particular angle under which the recombination photon is observed . in a second scenario ,",
    "the correlations between the polarization states of the recombination photons and the emission pattern of the subsequent decay have also been discussed .",
    "although the expressions derived in this paper can be applied to any excited hydrogenic state , detailed calculations were performed for the electron capture into the @xmath4 state of ( initially ) bare uranium ions u@xmath2 and its subsequent lyman@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) decay .",
    "these calculations indicate a rather strong correlation between the polarization states and emission patterns of the recombination and decay photons . apart from the coplanar geometry , which will be utilized most likely by forthcoming experiments at the gsi storage ring , detailed angular distributions of the stokes parameters",
    "are presented also for a non  coplanar set  up of the detectors . such a set  up is likely to be implemented at the super  ebit facilities .",
    "in particular , the geometry of the stockholm university s ",
    "ebit offers combinations of the observation angles alternative to those available at the gsi storage ring .",
    "the angles @xmath158 and @xmath159 are limited to 0@xmath136 or 90@xmath136 whereas the angle @xmath109 can be varied between 0@xmath136 and 360@xmath136 in steps of 45@xmath136 .",
    "the non coplanar geometry will be essential for the observation of the linear polarization of the lyman@xmath6 photons outside of the reaction plane .",
