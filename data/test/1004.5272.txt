    "a vector @xmath10 on a non - positively curved surface has rank one if and only if there is a point of negative sectional curvature on the geodesic generated by @xmath10 .",

    "the first instance of a closing lemma appears in the work of j. hadamard @xcite on negatively curved surfaces embedded in @xmath11 .",
    "j. hadamard showed that a piece of geodesic coming back close to its starting point is in fact shadowed by a periodic closed geodesic .",

    "remarkably , the result of j. hadamard is contemporary to the poincar recurrence theorem , and there were no examples of finite volume negatively curved surfaces embedded in @xmath11 at that time .",
    "first examples of such surfaces are attributed to vaigant in @xcite , although we were unable to locate the original reference . yet",
    "j. hadamard provided examples of negatively curved embedded surfaces in @xmath11 , and the closing lemma was one of the key ingredient in the study of recurrent geodesics on these surfaces .",
    "purely dynamical proofs of the closing lemma were given by d.v .",
    "anosov , who extended that result to the class of systems that now bear his name .",
    "the closing lemma has become a classical tool in the study of systems exhibiting some form of hyperbolic behavior , and the name of anosov is frequently associated with the theorem . in the context of negatively curved manifolds ,",

    "establishing the density of periodic orbits is the first step in the proof of the transitivity of the geodesic flow on compact connected rank one manifolds .",

    "we have seen that the closing lemma is satisfied on flat toruses .",

    "yet there are examples of surfaces on which there exists recurrent rank one trajectories that can not be closed .",

    "we say that a surface @xmath0 contains an _ embedded flat cylinder _ if there is a compact subset of @xmath0 which is isometric to the euclidean cylinder @xmath33\\times { \\bf r}/(2\\pi h{\\bf z})$ ] , for some @xmath34 .",
    "geodesics in the cylinder are straight lines .",
    "the periodic geodesics contained in the cylinder are parallel among themselves , and define a direction in the tangent bundle of the cylinder , that will be deemed as `` vertical ''",
    ". this direction will be depicted vertically in the figures .",
    "note that all negatively curved surfaces carrying a simple closed geodesic can be flattened around that geodesic so as to obtain a surface with an embedded cylinder .",

    "the orbit of @xmath57 itself must come back sufficiently close to @xmath57 however , so as to be directed toward the same boundary of the cylinder as @xmath41 , for the closure to happen .",

    "the flow is transitive in restriction to the closure of the rank one periodic orbits , that is , in restriction to the subset of @xmath4 contained in the negatively curved part of the surface .",
    "this implies that this subset is connected .",
    "in particular , a periodic rank one vector and its opposite are in the same connected component of the non wandering set .    in order to prove the connectedness of @xmath4 ,",
    "it is sufficient to show that the vector @xmath10 on the boundary of the flat half cylinder is in the closure of the rank one periodic vectors .",
