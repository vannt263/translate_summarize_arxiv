    "scalar light propagation is calculated using several diffraction calculations .",
    "these calculations , e.g. the angular spectrum method and fresnel diffractions , are used in wide - ranging optics fields @xcite , ultrasonic @xcite , x - ray @xcite and so on . in optics ,",
    "its applications include computer generated holograms ( cgh ) , digital holography , phase retrieval , image encryption and decryption , steganography , three - dimensional ( 3d ) analysis for optical devices , diffractive optical elements ( doe ) , and so on .    in cgh and digital holography ,",
    "diffraction calculations are vital .",
    "cgh are generated by calculating a diffraction calculation from a 3d object to a hologram plane on a computer .",
    "if we apply cgh to a 3d display technique @xcite , the technique becomes attractive because a wavefront reconstructed from cgh is almost equivalent to an object light .",
    "however , the computational time required for the diffraction calculation involved in cgh hampers the realization of a practical 3d display using cgh .",
    "many methods have thus been proposed for accelerating the computational time @xcite .",
    "digital holography is a well - known method for electronically recording existing 3d object information on a hologram , which is captured by a charge coupled device ( ccd ) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) cameras @xcite . to reconstruct 3d object information from a hologram in a computer , we need to calculate diffraction calculations .",
    "applications of digital holography include digital holographic microscopy ( dhm ) @xcite , digital holographic particle tracking velocimetry ( dhpiv ) @xcite and so forth .",
    "phase retrieval algorithm retrieves phase information of an object light from intensity patterns captured by ccd camera . in optics , gerchberg - saxton ( gs ) algorithm @xcite and modified algorithms , e.g. fresnel ping - pong @xcite and yang - gu @xcite algorithms ,",
    "are widely used for phase retrieval .",
    "the algorithms are based on iterative optimization : namely , they gradually retrieve phase information by calculating diffraction calculations between certain intensity patterns ( normally more than two ) while subject to amplitude and phase constraints .",
    "the applications of the algorithms include , for example , wavefront reconstruction @xcite , holographic projection @xcite and so on .    diffraction based encryption and decryption @xcite , and steganography @xcite were proposed .",
    "diffraction - based techniques have an interesting feature , and handle not only 2d but also 3d images .    in 3d analysis for optical devices , such as optical micro electro mechanical systems ( mems ) ,",
    "doe and so on , we can obtain 3d light distribution to stack multiple two - dimensional ( 2d ) diffraction calculations along depth - direction @xcite .",
    "for example , several research works have analyzed the optical characteristics of a digital micro - mirror device ( dmd ) , which is one of the mems devices , using fresnel diffraction and the angular spectrum method @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , diffraction calculations are practically used in wide - ranging optics fields .",
    "the former can also accelerate computational time using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm ; however , if we wish to realize real - time 3d reconstruction from holograms in digital holography , generate a large - area cgh , and obtain 3d light field from an optical device , recent computers lack sufficient computational power .",
    "using hardware is an effective means to further boost computational speed for cgh and diffraction calculations .",
    "in fact , we showed dramatically increased computational power to design and build special - purpose computers for cgh targeting a 3d display and named holographic reconstruction ( horn ) , in order to overcome the computational cost of cgh .",
    "the horn computers designed by pipeline architecture can calculate light intensities on cgh at high speed @xcite .",
    "the horn computers were implemented on a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) board , except horn-1 and -2 . to date",
    ", we have constructed six horn computers , which have been able to attain several thousand times the computational speed of recent computers .",
    "researchers also developed a special - purpose computer , fft - horn , in order to accelerate fresnel diffraction in dhpiv @xcite .",
    "the fft - horn was able to reconstruct @xmath0 images from holograms , which were captured by a dhpiv optical system , at a rate of 30 frames per second .",
    "the fpga - based approaches for both cgh and diffraction calculations showed excellent computational speed , but are subject to the following restrictions : the high cost of developing the fpga board , long development term , long compilation of the hardware description language and mapping to fpga times , and technical know - how required for the fpga technology .",
    "conversely , recent gpus allow us to use as a highly parallel processor , because the gpus have many simple processors , which can process 32- or 64-bit floating - point addition , multiplication and multiply - add instructions .",
    "the approach of accelerating numerical simulations using a gpu chip is referred to as general - purpose computation on gpu ( gpgpu ) or gpu computing .",
    "the merits of gpgpu include its high computational power , the low cost of the gpu board , short compilation time , and the short development term .",
    "we have already developed a numerical library for diffraction calculations using a gpu , which was named the gwo library @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the gwo library is to facilitate access to gpu calculation power for optics engineers and researchers lacking gpgpu .",
    "the gwo library has already been distributed via the internet and used to report some papers .",
    "for example , we reported on a real - time dhm system @xcite , diffraction calculations in a computer - aided design tool for developing a holographic display @xcite , a fast cgh calculation @xcite and a dhm observable in multi - view and multi - resolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , researchers studied airy beams generation and their propagation feature in the simulation using the gwo library @xcite .",
    "however , the gwo library is not user - friendly because it is based on c language , e.g. the library user must manage the cpu and gpu memory allocation personally and so on .",
    "in addition , the library is run on only a gpu , namely the diffraction and cgh calculations are not calculated on a cpu .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a c++ class library for computational wave optics involved in diffraction and cgh calculations , which is referred to as a cwo++ library , running on cpu and gpu . the cwo++ library , unlike the gwo library ,",
    "is developed using c++ and its structure , performance , and usage examples are described .    in section 2 , we describe diffraction calculations , the structure of the cwo++ library , the class  cwo \" for diffraction calculations , and the subclass  cwopls \" for point light source ( pls)-based diffraction and cgh calculations on a cpu . in section 3 , we describe the  gwo \" and  gwopls \" classes for diffraction and cgh calculations on a gpu . in section 4",

    "although it is possible to obtain a complete reconstructed image from a complex amplitude field , unfortunately , we lack an appropriate electric device to display the amplitude and phase of the complex amplitude field simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we need to select either the amplitude or the phase components of the complex amplitude field , which will cause the reconstructed image to deteriorate due to lack of information on the complex amplitude field .",
