    "by which information is aggregated and used in opinion formation and decision making is needed . in the case of the wisdom of crowds , which refers to having a better estimation of the solution to a question",
    "when the opinions of multiple heterogeneous agents are aggregated , it has been shown that social interaction can lead to misleading estimations @xcite .",
    "the issue of information aggregation is a hot topic which is expected to give insights into the solution of many societal problems . for example , 2014 s world economic forum s meeting has the title `` leveraging collective intelligence for unprecedented challenges '' .",
    "models of opinion dynamics are based on assumptions on the decision making process on interacting individuals .",
    "simple decision making rules employed in these models include proportional imitation ( i.e. , the rate of the opinion conversion is proportional to the number of peers possessing the different opinion ) , employed in the voter model , majority rules ( i.e. , the same rate is a superlinear function ) , thresholding rules ( i.e. , thresholding function ) , reinforcement rules ( i.e. , adaptive function depending on experiences of agents ) , and homophily rules ( i.e. , similar individuals more likely interact ) @xcite . the type of the employed decision making rule affects the possibility , final state , speed , and other dynamical phenomena of collective opinion formation . however , in physics and even social sciences literature , justification of these different types of models is at best based on a qualitative assessment of human behavior .",
    "beyond opinion dynamics , social dilemmas , which in many cases are based on binary decision making , also offer an opportunity to bridge theory to experiments @xcite .    for animals in groups ,",
    "recent work in this direction has identified bayesian inference as a mechanism behind their collective behavior @xcite . in humans ,",
    "experimental evidence of bayesian inference has been provided in the realm of perceptual and cognitive domains @xcite .",
    "effects of bayesian types of inference on collective behavior have been investigated with the use of mathematical and individual - based models @xcite . toward quantitative understanding of social decision making of humans , the seminal experiment by milgram and colleagues @xcite designed to assess the probability to stop by a group of bystanders has recently been reproduced @xcite whose",
    "results are fitted by a heuristic function .",
    "there are also other recent studies attempting to fit bayesian ( see the references above ) , evolutionary dynamical @xcite , and other @xcite models to behavioral data .",
    "the wisdom of crowds when interaction among participants is allowed is also a target of recent experimental studies @xcite .",

    "we focus on subjects answering questions with binary options , one of which is correct .",
    "this situation contrasts with that of the previous studies on the wisdom of crowds that allowed virtually real values of answers @xcite .",

    "in fact , for each question , there should be those who know the correct answer and those who do not .",
    "such personal knowledge can be incorporated to models for sequential answering @xcite . clarifying this issue warrants future work .",
    "second , we tried to incorporate the information about the previous responses into our model .",
    "however , the design of the experiment makes it difficult to cope with this issue .",
    "the answers offered to subject @xmath12 in each round are not a random sample from the pool of responses in the previous round , but are the responses of the previous respondents @xmath149 as initially labeled , which represents a biased sampling . together with the influence of the history of self - responses on the new decision , these features affect the decision making process of the subjects and thus the evolution of the fraction of correct answers . indeed in many situations individuals are not making decision from a tabula rasa but they are shaping decisions continuously from social interactions and external signals .",
    "future developments of the theory are expected to incorporate these ingredients to deal with more realistic situations .",
    "besides , large scale experiments taking advantage of the new technologies available would be welcome to confront with decision making theories .",
