    "the current paradigm of an exponentially expanding universe implies that large - scale , gravitationally bound structures will eventually become causally disconnected from each other , forming island universes scattered inside a mostly empty universe ( e.  g. , @xcite ) . in our previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter  paper i \" ) , we presented a criterion to determine the limits of bound structures , defining superclusters as the biggest gravitationally bound structures that will be able to form .",
    "this criterion defined a critical density contrast over which a spherical shell will stay bound to a spherically distributed overdensity . as defined , this criterion can only be applied to data given in real , three - dimensional space (  real space \" ) .",
    "this is not the case of observational data , which comes from large galaxy surveys having two angular coordinates and a velocity coordinate . using the hubble law",
    ", one can estimate the real distance to an object from its recession velocity , but , given that we are interested in dense , relatively evolved structures with significant peculiar velocities , our estimation will be strongly affected by the velocity dispersion of the structure , fooling any attempt to apply a real - space - based method @xcite .    here",
    "we present a way to apply our theoretical criterion to redshift - space data , permitting its application to redshift surveys .",
    "the new criterion is based on the geometrical appearance of the real - space criterion as seen in redshift space , and needs to be calibrated using statistics from @xmath0-body simulations to account for velocity dispersions not considered in the theoretical model presented in paper i. this method represents an alternative to the caustic approach , first proposed by @xcite and further developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the caustic method , based on the direct search for caustic curves which represent the redshift - space envelope of the bound structure within it , has been extensively used to study galaxy clusters ( e.  g. , @xcite ) , constituting the most widely used method in the area . among its main achievements ,",
    "it has been used to measure the mass profile and light to mass radio from galaxy clusters .",
    "our method , even though it shares some of the basic elements of the caustic method , as will be discussed later , has the independent motivation of directly representing the spherical collapse density criterion for the critical shell in redshift space , giving a clear physical interpretation to its results .    in section [ ingredients ]",
    ", we discuss the effects of transforming the real - space data into redshift space as seen from @xmath0-body simulations , introducing the critical projected velocity envelope , which is a theoretical construction produced by joint projection of all shells , within a certain radius , intersecting the line of sight .",
    "we also study the implementation of a parameterized template for the density profile , for which we used the density profile proposed by @xcite .    in section [ method ] ,",
    "we propose a new method for applying the criterion in redshift space , which is presented in three alternative versions .",
    "for this we introduce the concept of  density estimator \" , which replaces the previously used density contrast in determining the threshold that defines the critical shell .",
    "we statistically determine the value of this estimator , together with analyzing the main divergences from the spherical collapse theoretical model that introduce errors into the method .",
    "each version of the method will require one or more density estimators , which will be presented later .    in section [ testing",
    "] , we test our method using our @xmath0-body simulation , estimating the systematic error that is expected for radius and mass estimations for the gravitationally bound structure .    finally , in section [ conclusiones ] , we present our conclusions , together with a step by step recipe for applying one of the proposed methods .",
    "in paper i , we showed that the spherical collapse model , when extended to the case of a universe dominated by a cosmological constant , can be used to set a criterion for the  critical \" ( marginally bound ) shell of a mass concentration .",
    "the spherical shells are characterized by a single parameter named density contrast @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 stands for shell .",
    "its value , for the critical shell ( cs ) , can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean mass density enclosed by the shell , and @xmath5 is the critical density of the universe .    in the simulations ,",
    "this criterion was shown to give an external limit to the extension of gravitationally bound structures , overestimating their mass by 39% on average .",
    "nonetheless , the model gives in - falling velocity predictions which correctly follow the lower envelope of radial velocities deep into the virialized core of bound structures ( see fig . 8 in paper i ) .",
    "this , together with the one - to - one relation between the shell s infall speed and its enclosed density contrast , makes it possible to extend the model to a redshift - space representation .    to go from the real - space to the redshift - space representation",
    ", we need to replace the coordinate along the line of sight by the corresponding recession velocity . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the distance to the structures is much greater than their size , so we do not need to account for angular effects and the replacement can be done directly in cartesian space .",
    "an example of this transformation is shown in figure [ fig : real - redshift ] , where the structure on the right is the redshift representation of the structure on the left , as seen by an observer looking along the @xmath6 axis . in the case of a spherically symmetric structure ,",
    "as described by the spherical collapse model , the projected velocity seen by an observer will be composed by the projection of the radial velocity of the spherical shell with respect to its center and the recession velocity of the whole structure ( see figure [ fig : perfil]a ) .",
    "let us consider a spherically symmetric , gravitationally bound structure .",
    "each shell has its own radial speed , which only depends on its enclosed density contrast .",
    "as the spherical collapse model constrains the shells not to cross each other , we will see the innermost shells falling at greater speeds than outer ones . when moving from the center to greater radii",
    ", we will cross a shell that just stopped its expansion , through slowly expanding ones , up to shells expanding with the hubble flow . according to this model",
    ", the critical shell will be expanding with a speed ( critical velocity ) of only 29% of the hubble flow at the present time ( see paper i ) .",
    "we are interested in identifying all shells lying within the critical shell , each of which will have a different projected shape in redshift space .",
    "slowly expanding shells will appear as ellipsoids shrunk along the line of sight , while fast contracting ones will appear elongated along the line of sight , but flipped , so that apparently closer points will really be at the more distant side of the structure @xcite . a diagram explaining this effect",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : perfil ] , where a fast contracting shell has a higher projected velocity than the outer expanding shell , protruding from the outer ellipsoid and producing the well - known  finger of god \" effect .",
    "we define the _ projected velocity envelope _ as the surface that encloses the redshift - space representation of all shells within a given radius @xmath7 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath8}\\left\\{|v_r\\left(r\\right)|\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{r_p}{r}\\right)^2}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the radial velocity respect to the centre of the structure and @xmath10 is the projected radius on the sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spherical collapse model allows to predict @xmath11 , and therefore @xmath12 , directly from the density profile ( paper i ) .",
    "setting @xmath7 equal to the critical radius of the structure ( @xmath13 ) , yields the critical projected velocity envelope (  critical envelope \" , for short ) , corresponding to the redshift - space envelope of all shells within the critical shell .",
    "the velocity envelope , when defined up to the turn - around radius , is equivalent to the caustics defined by @xcite .",
    "if all the assumptions of the spherical collapse model were true , one would expect that all the bound particles should lie within this critical envelope .",
    "moreover , if inner ellipsoids protrude from the ellipsoid defined by the critical shell , then one would expect to see contamination in the protruding regions from objects outside the critical shell .",
    "an effect that is not considered in the spherical collapse model are the velocity perturbations due to the interaction between nearby objects that will mix many particles into and out of the critical envelope , causing large systematic and random errors in the intended criterion for determining the limits of the bound structure in redshift space . to account for these systematic errors we used @xmath0-body simulations as described in the next section .      in order to study the behaviour of structures in redshift space , we used numerical simulations , which permitted us to observe the redshift - space distribution of the structures , knowing at the same time which particles were bound and which were not .",
    "our simulations are the same as described in paper i , performed with the gadget2 code @xcite , containing @xmath14 dark matter particles inside a box of side length @xmath15 , and considering a flat @xmath16cdm universe with @xmath17 .",
    "we took snapshots at the present time ( @xmath18 ) and in the far future ( @xmath19 ) , assuming that in late epochs the structure evolution will decrease significantly so no major changes will be seen from then on ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we selected the 11 largest structures for our study , with masses ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "although these structures might be rather small to represent our current understanding of superclusters , many of them showed significant substructure , as expected from objects that are still evolving into a virialized state .",
    "the bound particles were identified using the state at @xmath19 and then correspondingly tagged and followed to the present frame , repeating the procedure described in paper i.    in order to transform the simulated data to redshift space , we replaced the distance along one axis by the corresponding projected velocity .",
    "this can be done in any direction , but for simplicity we did so only along the three main axes , giving a total of 33 data sets for statistical analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : vp ] shows the critical envelope for two objects in our study with nearly spherical symmetry , with radii normalized in terms of the critical radius @xmath13 and velocities referred to the hubble flow at @xmath13 .",
    "these critical envelopes were obtained measuring the density contrast at all radii and applying the procedure described in paper i to find the radial velocity , and finally projecting it along the line of sight . at large radius , where there is no ellipsoid crossing , we see the ellipsoid corresponding to the critical shell , which has the same shape since its expansion velocity is the same fraction ( @xmath22 in present time ) of the hubble flow ( see paper i ) . at smaller radius",
    "we observe the existence of ellipsoid crossing in redshift space , which is produced because the inner shells are contracting faster than the expansion velocity of the critical shell . adjusting the object s centre",
    ", we observe an improvement in matching the resulting profiles .",
    "specifically , a choice closer to the densest core of the structure increases the height of the peak of the velocity envelopes and improves the agreement between the shapes of curves corresponding to different objects .",
    "even though the profiles do not match exactly at small radii , all of them share the same characteristic shape , showing higher velocities in less massive objects , meaning a higher concentration than more massive structures , in qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest that it may be possible to estimate the critical envelope by a general template that depends only on the bound mass of the structure .",
    "to study the accuracy of the prediction given by the critical envelope for the location of particles in redshift space , we counted the number of bound particles inside and outside the critical envelope , as well as the number of unbound particles inside the critical envelope .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ performance ] .",
    "we used the same statistical indicators as in paper i , so now we can compare the performance of the criteria in redshift and real spaces .",
    "the indicators , all expressed as _ percentages of the total number of particles inside the critical envelope _ , are :    * @xmath23 : particles inside the critical envelope that do not belong to the cluster at @xmath24 .",
    "* @xmath25 : particles inside the critical envelope that do belong to the cluster at @xmath24 .",
    "* @xmath26 : particles outside the critical envelope that belong to the cluster at @xmath24 . * @xmath27 : all particles that belong to the cluster at @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath28 = 100% and @xmath29 .",
    ".mean values and standard deviations for several performance indicators for the critical envelope corresponding to the true density profile ( see text ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ errores ]    the expected errors calculated in this way are shown in table [ errores ] .",
    "we emphasise that these errors are the ones we should expect after a  brute - force \" application of the method , having no consideration of the observable morphology of the structure .",
    "due to the statistical nature of the fitting method , one would expect significant improvement in the expected errors after a more careful analysis of individual cases , where different  kinds \" of structures , including structures with evident double cores or highly contaminated by substructure , were considered .",
    "this analysis is beyond the scope of this work , but can be included in future works .",
    "we have presented a new method to estimate the mass and radius of gravitationally bound structures based solely on redshift information present in redshift survey catalogs .",
    "the method is based on the spherical collapse model ( paper i ) and on the important observation that the theoretical critical envelope correctly follows the true critical envelope deep inside the virialized centre of the simulated structures .",
    "we used the nfw density profile @xcite to generate a template for the critical envelope , which was calibrated using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the extension of the method to redshift space gave birth to a new set of criteria that we called  density estimators \" .",
    "these were defined as the expected redshift - space density inside the projected velocity envelope .",
    "their calculation was completely empirical , depending on statistical analysis of simulated structures due to the considerable velocity dispersion found in them .",
    "we observed that the main cause of velocity dispersion was the gain of peculiar velocities due to local interaction between in - falling objects and substructure .",
    "the study of substructure and of the morphology of the studied structure can be of great help to improve the error bars , since the density estimators show great dependence on these properties . from this",
    ", we conclude that numerical simulations can be used to emulate the particular properties of the studied structures , producing  custom - made \" methods to obtain the best results .",
    "in contrast to the caustic method , our method forces a limit to the radius of the structure , defined as the maximum radius at which one should expect to find bound objects .",
    "the shape of the velocity envelope though is less flexible than the caustics shape , suggesting that a combination of both methods can give better results , finding the envelope at lower radii using the caustics where they are more defined , and using the fixed envelope at higher radii to set a limit to the structure .",
    "the more reliable methods from the study were the  combined \" and the  nfw - cs \" methods .",
    "the procedure to apply the combined method to a redshift data set is then the following :    * calibrate data so that every element is accurately related to a mass , so that the whole data set serves as a redshift - space mass field .",
    "* identify the center of the structure by maximising the number of particles inside the core envelope for a given density estimator .",
    "* fit the nfw profile to the central region ( core ) by adjusting @xmath30 until the measured density estimator is equal to the mean density estimator for the core , given in table [ mean_rho_real ] . *",
    "add the ellipsoid given by @xmath13 to the critical envelope , and adjust @xmath13 to the value @xmath31 , at which the density estimator inside the total critical envelope is equal to the mean density estimator for the combined method , given in table [ mean_rho_real ] .",
    "* given @xmath31 , calculate the bound mass using equation [ real - space - crit ] .",
    "* the fractional errors for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given in table [ errores ] .    in our next paper",
    "we will present the application of the method presented here to estimate the size and bound mass of the shapley supercluster @xcite .",
