    "these observationally constrained rates are then compared to the rates implied by local galaxy - merger observations .",
    "this work is summarized in section   4 .",

    "observational gw astronomy can be used to resolve whether smbh binary systems form and whether the two black holes can get close enough to emit detectable gws .",
    "this work focuses on the rate constraints measurable by pulsar timing observations . in order to determine the coalescence rate",
    ", one needs to know the expected gw amplitude emitted by a smbh binary .",
    "this is given by @xcite @xmath6^{2/3 } , \\label{amp}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the `` chirp mass '' of the smbh binary given by @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the individual black hole masses , @xmath11 is observed gw frequency , @xmath12 is the comoving distance to the system @xmath13 with @xmath14 for a @xmath15cdm cosmological model ( hereafter we adopt @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "gws from such a source will induce sinusoidally oscillating arrival - time variations whose amplitude , @xmath19 , is given by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) : @xmath20\\sin(2\\phi)\\sin\\{\\omega d[1 - \\cos(\\theta)]/2c\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the gw frequency in radians / s , @xmath22 is the angle on the sky between the pulsar direction and the gw source direction , @xmath23 is the gw polarization angle , and @xmath24 is the distance to the pulsar . the maximum induced timing residual amplitude , @xmath25 , is plotted in figure [ rvsz ] as a function of redshift for chirp masses of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and observed gw frequencies of ( 1 year)@xmath28 and ( 10 year)@xmath28 .",
    "the most notable feature in this figure is that these amplitude curves are not monotonically decreasing with increasing redshift .",
    "the reason for this is that the observing frequency is held fixed and the frequency in the frame of the emitting system increases with increasing redshift . for a binary system ,",
    "the emitted gw amplitude increases with increasing frequency . for large @xmath29 ,",
    "this increase is faster than the decrease due to increasing comoving distance @xmath12 .",
    "also note that the curves cutoff at large @xmath29 .",
    "this is because there is a maximum orbital frequency allowed before the black holes plunge together .",
    "this maximum frequency was taken to be @xmath30 assuming a circular orbit @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath31 is the total mass of a binary system .",
    "rms timing residuals ( for a typical 1-hour observation ) for the best pulsar data sets are currently around 100ns .",
    "multiple observations combined with improved systems will bring the effective sensitivity down to around 10ns . in this case ,",
    "figure [ rvsz ] shows that pulsar timing will be sensitive to individual smbh binary systems with chirp masses greater than about @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ rvsz ] also shows that this sensitivity extends to large redshifts .",
    "this fact greatly increases the chances of detecting individual sources .",
    "an ensemble of lower - mass smbh binary systems will be detectable as a stochastic background if there is a large enough population of sources .",
    "since pulsar timing techniques are sensitive to smbh binary systems up to high redshifts , the non - detection of any sources , either individual binaries or a background generated by an ensemble of binary systems , may be used to place a direct constraint on @xmath33 , the sky - averaged rate of coalescence of binary smbhs per unit chirp mass , @xmath7 , per unit redshift @xmath29 .",
    "the total number of binary smbhs with chirp mass between @xmath7 and @xmath34 and located between @xmath29 and @xmath35 merging between time @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 .",
    "constraints placed on this quantity may be used to rule out various binary smbh formation models .",
    "we present two methods for determining the coalescence rate from pulsar timing data .",
    "the first is valid when the rate is high enough that the gws form a stochastic background ( the `` stochastic constraint '' ) and there is a large number of sources per resolvable frequency bin .",
    "the second method ( the `` poissonian constraint '' ) provides an estimate of the coalescence rate when the stochastic constraint does not hold . for a real data set",
    "it is practical first to assume the stochastic constraint , determine the coalescence rate and check whether the rate is high enough for the assumption to be valid . if not then the poissonian constraint should be used .      here",
    ", it is assumed that a large number of smbh binary sources form an incoherent background of gws .",
    "the power spectrum of such a background is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is given by equation  [ amp ] and @xmath41 is the rate of change of the observed gw frequency . for the case of a binary system",
    "evolving under general relativity alone , this is given by @xcite @xmath42 typically , a stochastic background of gws is described by its characteristic strain spectrum , @xmath2 , which is assumed to take on a power law form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the characteristic strain at a period of one year . for a background generated by smbh binaries , @xmath46 in frequency range @xmath0@xmath1 hz @xcite .",
    "note that the characteristic strain spectrum is related to the power spectrum by @xmath47 .",
    "pulsar timing data sets provide an upper bound , @xmath48 , on @xmath45 .",
    "such bounds limit the power spectrum of the gw strain .",
    "the upper bound , @xmath49 , may be written as @xmath50 since this is an upper bound , we have @xmath51 in order to use equations  [ power1 ] and [ ub ] to obtain a constraint on the differential rate of coalescence itself , the integrand is rewritten in an equivalent form : @xmath52 note that both @xmath53 and @xmath41 depend on @xmath29 and @xmath7 , although the explicit dependence is not written .",
    "a constraint on @xmath54 is a direct constraint on the integral in the above expression . in order to obtain an estimate of the upper bound on the integrand",
    ", we follow the same line of reasoning used to place constraints on the differential energy density of gravitational waves using bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "first , we note that the limits in the integral of equation [ power2 ] are from 0 to @xmath55 for @xmath56 and from @xmath57 to @xmath55 for @xmath58 .",
    "consider this integral over a small region bounded by @xmath59 to @xmath60 and @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "denote this integral as @xmath63 where @xmath64 the mean value theorem tells us that there exist values of @xmath7 and @xmath29 , written as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "next , we assume that the integrand varies slowly over the region of integration so that @xmath63 does not change much as long as @xmath65 and @xmath66 are chosen within this region . from this , we see that @xmath63 is approximately given by @xmath70 for any value of @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "next , since the integrand in equation [ power2 ] is positive definite , it follows that @xmath73 from equations [ pup ] , [ ub ] , [ power_approx ] , and [ ub2 ] we have : @xmath74 where we are free to choose any value for @xmath7 and @xmath29 provided that the integrand is slowly varying over the appropriate region . using the known expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", one can use equation [ integrand_c ] to obtain a constraint on the differential rate of coalescence .",
    "assuming @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the constraint takes the form @xmath77 which is independent of frequency .",
    "therefore , a measured bound , @xmath48 , can be used directly to constrain the smbh coalescence rate .",
    "note that , if one believes that the integrand changes more rapidly with @xmath29 and/or @xmath7 , one can choose a sufficiently small integration range over which this assumption is true and then rescale the above constraint .",
    "this constraint is only valid when there are a large number of sources emitting into the same frequency band at the same time . in order for this to be true",
    ", the gw amplitude of each source must be much less than the minimum detectable amplitude as determined by the statistical properties of the pulsar timing data , otherwise a detection would have been made .",
    "this reasoning leads to the following constraint : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the resolution bandwidth which is taken to be @xmath80 .",
    "for the purposes of making numerical estimates , the following constraint is used @xmath81 for a fixed chirp mass and frequency , this expression is a constraint on @xmath29 .",
    "the most stringent constraint occurs when @xmath82 , the lowest observable frequency . combining the above with equations  [ amp ] and [ pup ] yields the following constraint on the redshift @xmath83 the factor @xmath84 decreases with @xmath29 until @xmath852.65 , where it starts to increase .",
    "hence , there is a bounded redshift interval over which the stochastic constraint is valid . for systems outside of this range ,",
    "the stochastic rate limit is not valid and the poisson rate limit discussed in the next section must be employed .      for this case , the sources are not numerous enough to form a stochastic background , so they must be treated as individual events . assuming poissonian statistics for the probability of an event occurring , the probability that no events are detected is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the expected number of events . since no events are detected in the pulsar timing data , the upper limit on the expected number , @xmath88 ,",
    "is set so that @xmath89 .",
    "hence , @xmath90 .",
    "if the actual expected number were greater than @xmath91 , then at least one source would have been detected with 95% probability .",
    "provided that the expected number of events that occur within the resolution bandwidth is less than one , the expected number of detectable events is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the probability of detecting a smbh binary with chirp mass @xmath7 at a redshift of @xmath29 with observable frequency @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath94 takes into account non - gw noise sources that can reduce the gw detection efficiency . following the same argument used in the previous section to obtain an upper bound on the differential rate using an integral constraint",
    ", we find that : @xmath95 as with the stochastic constraint , it is assumed that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this constraint should be appropriately rescaled if the integrand in equation [ exp_num ] varies over shorter intervals .",
    "the above constraint requires a knowledge of @xmath94 , the probability of detecting a smbh binary system using pulsar timing data .",
    "the @xmath94 is calculated using a method similar to that in @xcite . for our analysis",
    "we use a monte - carlo simulation together with the data analysis pipeline @xcite used to search for gws in real and simulated pulsar timing data .",

    "the power spectra of the timing residuals are calculated and added together .",
    "this summed power spectrum is used as the detector .",
    "we determine noise levels and hence detection thresholds for each frequency channel so that the false alarm rate for a detection is 0.001 across the entire power spectrum .",
    "the detection thresholds are found by producing 100,000 fake data sets by shuffling the input timing residuals , carrying out standard pulsar timing fits and forming the summed power spectrum .    once the thresholds are determined , the probability of detecting a gw with a given strain amplitude is calculated as follows .",
    "a gw strain amplitude @xmath45 and frequency @xmath11 are chosen ( this procedure is repeated on a logarithmically spaced grid where @xmath45 ranges from @xmath97@xmath98 and @xmath11 ranges from 1/(30 years)1/(2 weeks ) ) .",

    "this constraint is based on a continuous - wave detection algorithm and it assumes that the number of coalescence events are distributed according to a poisson distribution . in both cases , it is assumed that the differential rate of coalescence varies sufficiently slowly over a range of chirp masses and redshifts .",
    "the precise numerical value of the constraint depends on the size of the interval over which the rate is assumed to be nearly constant .",

    "the upper end of the range of backgrounds produced by smbh population synthesis models @xcite would be detectable by the ppta goal sensitivity , but higher sensitivity will be needed to further constrain these models if the gw background is not detected .",
