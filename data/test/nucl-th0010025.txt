    "it is necessary to improve our model in several directions .    to improve our results in the higher energy region(figs .",
    "3 - 4,13 ) , we need to include the coupling with other reaction channels .",
    "an obvious step is to extend the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamile ] ) to include the transitions to @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 states and to include some higher mass @xmath7 states .",
    "the resulting scattering equations will be more complex than what are given in ref.@xcite and outlined in eqs .",
    "( [ tmatt])-([self ] ) .",
