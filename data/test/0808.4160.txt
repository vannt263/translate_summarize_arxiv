    "a common problem in statistical physics is that the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) are always too complicated for practical calculations and we need to replace them by more tractable approximations .",
    "a possible solution is to identify a family of trial distributions @xmath0 , where x are parameters characterized systems and select the member of the family that is closest  to the exact  distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the problem , of course , is that it is not clear what one means by ` closest ' .",
    "one could minimize    @xmath2 ^{2},\\ ] ]    but why this particular functional and not another ? and also , why limit oneself to an approximation by a single member of the trial family ? why not consider a linear combination of the trial distributions , some kind of average over the trial family ?",
    "but then , how should we choose the optimal weight assigned to each @xmath3 ? we propose to tackle these questions using the method of maximum relative entropy ( which we abbreviate as me ) and information geometry @xcite .",
    "the me method , which is developed in @xcite-@xcite , has historical roots in the earlier method of maximum entropy that was pioneered by e. t. jaynes and is commonly known as maxent @xcite .",
    "the me method is designed for updating probabilities from arbitrary priors for information in the form of arbitrary constraints and it includes bayes rule and the older maxent as special cases @xcite , @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to develop a me based method to generate optimal approximations ( brief accounts of some of the results discussed below have previously been presented in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the general formalism , which is the main result of this paper , is developed in section [ sec2 ] . in section",
    "[ sec2 - 1 ] we justify the use of relative entropy as the unique and natural criterion to select the preferred approximation , which is labeled by some parameters .",
    "the optimal approximation is obtained in section [ sec2 - 3 ] by marginalizing over the variational parameters .",
    "a suitably weighed average over the whole family of trial distributions with the optimal weight provides an optimal approximation .",
    "in the second part of the paper we demonstrate the proposed formalism by applying it to simple classical fluids , a well studied field in the past barkerhenderson76-@xcite . to approximate the behavior of simple fluids we chose trial distributions that describe hard spheres @xcite-@xcite ( section  [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the me formalism is first used ( section  [ sec4 ] ) to select the preferred value of the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "this is equivalent to applying the bogoliubov variational principle and reproduces the results obtained by mansoori et al .",
    "@xcite whose variational principle was justified by a very different argument .",
    "an advantage of the variational or the me methods over the perturbative approaches such as barker and henderson ( bh ) @xcite and of weeks , chandler and anderson ( wca ) @xcite is that there is no need for ad hoc criteria dictating how to separate the intermolecular potential into a strong short range repulsion and a weak long range attraction . on the other hand ,",
    "a disadvantage of the standard variational approach is that it fails to take the softness of the repulsive core into account . at high temperatures",
    "this leads to results that are inferior to the perturbative approaches .    in the standard variational",
    "a single preferred value of the hard - sphere diameter is selected .",
    "but , as discussed in @xcite and caticha00 , in the me method non - preferred values are not completely ruled out .",
    "this allows us ( in section  [ sec5 ] ) to marginalize over hard sphere diameter to obtain an optimal hard - sphere approximation with a suitable weighting .",
    "that leads to significant improvements over the standard variational method .    in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we test our method by comparing its predictions for a lennard - jones model for argon with molecular dynamics simulation data ( verlet68 , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the me predictions for thermodynamic variables and for the radial distribution function are considerable improvements over the standard bogoliubov variational result , and are comparable to the perturbative results barkerhenderson76 @xcite .",
    "( for a recent discussion of some of the strengths and limitations of the perturbative approach see @xcite . ) . despite the shortcomings of perturbation theory",
    "it remains very popular because it provides quantitative insights at a much lower computational cost than dynamical simulations . for recent applications to the glass transition and other more complex systems",
    "see @xcite - @xcite .",
    "although in this work the me is not applied to such complex problems one may fully expect that the information theory based me method will yield insights not only the thermodynamic behavior of complex systems but also about the approximation methods needed to analyze them . finally , our conclusions and some remarks on further improvements are presented in section  [ sec7 ] .",

    "the basic strategy @xcite is one of induction : ( 1 ) if a general rule exists , then it must apply to special cases ; ( 2 ) if in a certain special case we know which is the best approximation , then this knowledge can be used to constrain the form of @xmath16 $ ] ; and finally , ( 3 ) if enough special cases are known , then @xmath20 $ ] will be completely determined .",

    "the consequence of the axiom is that non - overlapping domains of @xmath4 contribute additively to the entropy : @xmath20=\\int dq\\,f(p(q))$ ] where @xmath9 is some unknown function .",
    "* axiom 2 : coordinate invariance . * _ the ranking should not depend on the system of coordinates . _ the coordinates that label the points @xmath4 are arbitrary ; they carry no information .",

    "next we make a second use of axiom 1 ( locality ) .",
    "when there are no constraints at all and the family of trials includes the exact @xmath11 the selected trial should coincide with @xmath11 ; that is , the best approximation to @xmath11 is @xmath11 itself .",
    "the consequence is that up to normalization the previously unknown density @xmath26 is the exact distribution @xmath11 .",

    "figure [ fig3].(b ) shows that increasing @xmath199 ( with fixed density @xmath97 ) decreases the width of @xmath165 ( solid lines ) and induces a slight shift of the whole distribution .",

    "the agreement between the me curve and verlet s data is good .",
    "the vast improvement over the simpler variational method calculation is clear .",
    "one might be tempted to dismiss this achievement as due to the adjustment of the parameter @xmath199 but this is not quite correct : @xmath236  has not been adjusted , it has been calculated by fitting @xmath163 to optimal mean field rdf @xmath250 for @xmath203 . indeed , despite the fact that the hard - sphere trial solutions that we employ are mere approximations , the functional form of the whole curve @xmath163 in eq .",
    "( [ ghs bar ] ) is reproduced quite well .",
    "however , one may note that the agreement between the me prediction and verlet s data becomes worse when the fluid density is decreased or the temperature is increased .",
    "the reason has been spelled out by in the studies of wca @xcite they demonstrate that both the repulsive and attractive forces contribute to the fluid structure when fluid is at low and moderate densities ( @xmath251 ) . however , when the fluid density is high enough ( @xmath252 ) , the repulsive force becomes dominant . because the hard - sphere approximation does not include the attractive force , the hard - sphere rdf does not take the attractive force into account , and this error propagates into our me prediction .",

    "the eme results constitute a clear improvement over the plain variational calculation . for low densities",
    "all four methods agree with each other but differ from the simulation .",
    "a better agreement in this region would probably require a better treatment of two - particle correlations at long distances . at intermediate densities the best agreement",
    "is provided by the eme and bh results , while the wca theory seems to be the best at high densities .",
    "also shown in fig [ fig10].(a ) are experimental data on argon @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental curve and the verlet simulation is very likely due to the actual potential not being precisely of the lennard - jones type .    in fig",

    "a more exhaustive exploration lies , however , outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the goal of this paper has been to use the eme method to generate approximations and show that this provides a generalization of the bogoliubov variational principle .",
    "this addresses a range of applications that lie beyond the scope of the traditional maxent . to test the method we considered simple classical fluids .",
    "when faced with the difficulty of dealing a system described by an intractable hamiltonian , the traditional approach has been to consider a similar albeit idealized system described by a simpler more tractable hamiltonian .",
    "the approach we have followed here departs from this tradition : our goal is not to identify an approximately similar hamiltonian but rather to identify an approximately similar probability distribution .",
    "the end result of the eme approach is a probability distribution which is a sum or an integral over distributions corresponding to different hard - sphere diameters .",
    "while each term in the sum is of a form that can be associated to a real hard - sphere gas , the sum itself is not of the form @xmath260 , and can not be interpreted as describing any physical system .",
    "as far as the application to simple fluids is concerned the results achieved in this paper represent progress but further improvements are possible by using better approximations to the hard - sphere fluid and by choosing a broader family of trial distributions .",
    "an important improvement would be to use trial probability distributions that allow inhomogeneities in the hard sphere diameters . this would lead to a systematic , fully eme method for the determination of the effective number of particles @xmath199 that are locally relevant .",
    "many perturbative approaches to fluids had been proposed , and a gradual process of selection over many years of research led to the optimized theories of bh and wca .",
    "the variational approach was definitely less satisfactory than these bestperturbation theories . with our work",
    ", however , the situation has changed : the eme - improved variational approach offers predictions that already are competitive with the best perturbative theories . and , of course , the potential for further improvements of the eme approach remains , at this early date , far from being exhausted .",
