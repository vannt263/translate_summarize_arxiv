    "the standard big bang model is based on the assumption of homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter and radiation .",
    "this assumption then leads to the robertson - walker ( rw ) space - time geometry and the friedmann - lematre ( fl ) universe model through the einstein equations .",
    "this model has succeeded in explaining various important observational facts : the hubble s expansion law , the contents of light elements and the isotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr)@xcite .",
    "the cmbr conversely gives a strong observational basis for the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of our universe by its highly isotropic distribution together with the copernican principle .",
    "indeed , the deviation of our universe from a homogeneous and isotropic space is as small as @xmath2@xcite at the stage of decoupling .",
    "thus our universe is well approximated by a fl model before this stage .",
    "on the other hand , the present universe is highly inhomogeneous on small scales ; the density contrast is of the order of @xmath3 in the solar system , @xmath4 on galactic scales , and of the order of unity even on the scale of superclusters .",
    "we have to go beyond fl models in considering such systems .",
    "for a long time we have regarded that a fl model is a large - scale `` average '' of a locally inhomogeneous universe ( averaging hypothesis ) . even though the observational data are consistent with the picture that our universe is described well by a rw metric , we are not sure how to derive the background fl model from the inhomogeneous universe by any averaging procedure , or how the non - linear inhomogeneities on small scales affect large - scale behavior of the universe@xcite . although one can derive a background fl model from observations of the nearby galaxies with any rule of averaging one likes , it is uncertain whether this background fl model agrees with the fl model whose cosmological parameters was defined at the stage of decoupling .",
    "the discrepancies might appear , for example , in the estimate of the density of baryonic matter , the density parameter , the age of our universe , and so on .",
    "these still remain a non - trivial question to which we have to give a clear answer .",
    "a number of approaches have been made to study how the small - scale inhomogeneities affect the global dynamics when averaged on larger scales@xcite .",
    "the first work which explicitly showed the existence of such an effect was performed by futamase@xcite . assuming small deviation of the space - time geometry from the rw one , futamase constructed an elegant formalism by the use of the post - newtonian expansion and isaacson s prescription to take into account the back reaction of the small - scale inhomogeneities on the global cosmic expansion .",
    "after his works , buchert and ehlers@xcite studied this back reaction problem in the framework of the newtonian cosmology in which the corresponding background fl model is uniquely determined through the spatial averaging of physical quantities without any uncontrolled approximation .",
    "they showed that inhomogeneities do not influence the overall expansion in spatially compact models ( the topology of its spatial section is @xmath5 ) if they are averaged over the whole space .",
    "in other cases , the significance of inhomogeneities may depend on the cosmology one adopts .",
    "another interesting approach has been made by carfora and piotrkowska@xcite , in which 3-dimensional geometry is deformed according to the ricci - hamiltonian flow which they say would be equivalent to changing the scale of averaging .",
    "they derive a homogeneous geometry which corresponds to a large - scale average of an inhomogeneous universe , and discussed the effect of inhomogeneities on the cosmological parameters .    in spite of these works ,",
    "the effect of inhomogeneities on the cosmological parameters remains unclear ; there are even apparent discrepancies in their statements .",
    "the reason seems to lie in the different definition of back reaction of inhomogeneities@xcite ; its definition is ambiguous since they do not treat observable quantities in these works .",
    "thus , in order to understand clearly the effects of inhomogeneities , it is necessary to relate them with physical quantities which we can give an unambiguous definition .",
    "bildhauer@xcite showed that the global cosmic expansion rate is not isotropic if the back reaction of small - scale inhomogeneities are taken into account and then investigated its observational effects on the cmbr .",
    "after this work , bildhauer and futamase@xcite discussed the possibility that the observed dipole anisotropy in the cmbr comes from this effect .",
    "these works are significant in the sense that the back reactions on the observable quantities were discussed , but they did not consider the cases where we try to determine the cosmological parameters by observing an inhomogeneous universe .    in this paper , we investigate the relation between distance and redshift in an inhomogeneous universe . as an inhomogeneous model , we take a spherically symmetric dust  shell model , in which light rays travel from each dust shell toward an observer at the center .",
    "we calculate angular diameter distance  redshift ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) relation and compare it with that of a fl model .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to clarify the condition under which the distance ",
    "redshift relation of a dust ",
    "shell universe behaves like that of a fl model .",
    "we investigate the behavior of the averaged density around the observer at the center when we gradually extend the averaged region to the outer shells , and discuss the relation among the behavior of the averaged density , the energy density of the fl model , and the observed distance  redshift relation .",
    "we note two interesting points of a dust  shell model .",
    "first , its dynamics is exactly solved ; it is not necessary to assume the existence of homogeneous background in order to obtain the behavior of density fluctuations .",
    "secondly , it can treat a discrete mass distribution where the linear perturbation theory is invalid , and can also treat a highly general - relativistic situation where the scale of inhomogeneities are comparable to the horizon scale .    the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section , we present basic equations for the dynamics of a dust ",
    "shell universe , distance to the shells from the center , and redshift of the shells measured by an observer at the center .",
    "we give our results and discussion on @xmath0@xmath1 relation and averaged density in section 3 , followed by concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "we follow the sign convention of the riemann tensor and the metric tensor in @xcite and adopt the unit of @xmath6 .",
    "we put a number of spherically symmetric shells whose centers are common at @xmath7 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the innermost shell is called the first shell , the next one is called the second shell , and so on .",
    "the region enclosed by the @xmath8-th shell and @xmath9-th shell is called the @xmath9-th region .",
    "each shell is infinitesimally thin , characterized by the surface stress - energy tensor which is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a gaussian coordinate ( @xmath12 on the shell ) in the direction normal to the shell .",
    "since each region between the shells is vacuum , the space - time is described by the schwarzschild geometry by the birkhoff s theorem .",
    "the line element in the @xmath9-th region is written in the form @xmath13 where the parameter @xmath14 will be referred to as a gravitational mass ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 is the line element of a unit sphere .",
    "we first derive the expansion law of the @xmath9-th shell following@xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a unit space - like vector normal to the trajectory of the shell , and define the projection operator @xmath18 . from the projected einstein equation",
    "@xmath19 one obtains @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lie derivative along @xmath17 and @xmath22 is the 3-dimensional ricci tensor on the timelike hypersurface generated by the motion of the shell . the extrinsic curvature @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "integration of equation ( [ proj ] ) over an infinitesimal range along @xmath17 yields @xmath27 where the suffix ` @xmath28 ' denotes a quantity evaluated at the outside of the shell and ` @xmath29 ' at the inside . using equation ( [ k1 ] ) and the gauss ",
    "codazzi relation @xmath30 , one finds that the following relation holds for a dust  shell : @xmath31    combining equations ( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) and substituting the expression of the metric and the stress ",
    "energy tensor , we obtain the following equation for the circumferential radius @xmath32 ( the `` expansion law '' of the dust shell ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the proper time of the shell .",
    "we have also introduced the `` baryonic '' mass @xmath38 given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the surface density of the @xmath9-th shell ; @xmath41 .",
    "it can be shown this baryonic mass is constant of motion by the conservation law , @xmath42 where the semicolon denotes the 3-dimensional covariant derivative on the trajectory of the shell .    in this paper",
    ", we shall use a common proper time @xmath37 for all the shells .",
    "the relation between @xmath37 and the time coordinate , @xmath43 , in schwarzschild space - time is obtained as follows .",
    "first , note that two schwarzschild time coordinates are assigned to each shell : the @xmath9-th shell has the time @xmath44 measured in the @xmath9-th region and @xmath45 measured in the @xmath46-th region .",
    "then , from the normalization condition for the 4-velocity of a shell , we obtain @xmath47^{1\\over2 } , \\label{eq : ex - time}\\\\   { dt_{(-)i}\\over d\\tau } & = & \\left({r_{i}\\over r_{i}-2gm_{i}}\\right )    \\left[1-{2gm_{i}\\over r_{i } }   + \\left({dr_{i}\\over d\\tau}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{1\\over2}.\\label{eq : in - time}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the procedure to determine the initial points of each time coordinate is described later .      in order to specify a dust ",
    "shell universe , we have to fix the parameters in equation ( [ motion ] ) and the initial hypersurface .",
    "we first rewrite equation ( [ motion ] ) in the form corresponding to the hubble equation of fl models .",
    "we denote the initial circumferential radius of the @xmath9-th shell by @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 we define @xmath50 by @xmath51 and @xmath52 by @xmath53 then the expansion law of the dust  shell is written as @xmath54 we see that the first term behaves like a non - relativistic matter term in the hubble equation of fl models , the second and the third like a curvature and a radiation source term . from this point of view , @xmath50 and @xmath55 play roles of the `` energy density '' and the `` curvature '' , respectively .",
    "the radiation - like term might be regarded as the effect of the binding energy of the shell@xcite .",
    "further it is worthwhile to note that this radiation - like term is consistent with futamase s result about the effect of the small - scale inhomogeneities on the global cosmic expansion@xcite . seeing this",
    ", one may expect that the inhomogeneities tend to make the hubble parameter larger compared with a homogeneous universe which has the same `` energy density '' of non - relativistic matter .",
    "however , this radiation - like term does not necessarily imply the larger hubble parameter . in order to see the effect of this term on the hubble parameter , we need to investigate the distance",
    " redshift relation by solving the null geodesic equations and compare the result in the inhomogeneous space - time and that of the fl model .",
    "such an analysis will be performed in the following sections .    a dust ",
    "shell universe is specified if we set the parameters contained in equation ( [ expa ] ) , i.e. , @xmath50 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and an initial hypersurface .",
    "when we increase the number of the shells to infinity with @xmath50 and @xmath55 being finite and independent of @xmath9 ( we will mention this limit as `` large @xmath57 limit '' ) , the dust ",
    "shell universe approaches a fl model if we take an appropriate initial hypersurface , as we will see in section 3 .",
    "then the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath55 agree with the ordinary energy density and curvature in the hubble equation .",
    "we take @xmath58 for all @xmath9 in the remaining sections .",
    "this means that the increase in the gravitational mass @xmath14 is equal to the baryonic mass of the shell . in other words , the kinetic energy of the shell balances with the potential energy , and",
    "hence the total energy becomes equal to the rest mass .",
    "this is also the simplest case which approaches a flat fl model in the large @xmath57 limit .",
    "choice of the other parameters and the initial hypersurface will be discussed in section 3 .    for notational convenience",
    ", we shall introduce the following quantities : @xmath59 from equations ( [ eq : gmass - def ] ) and ( [ eq : dmass - def ] ) , the following relations hold @xmath60 then the equation for the circumferential radius , @xmath61 , of the @xmath9-th shell is written in the form @xmath62 where we have assumed that each shell initially expands . from equations ( [ eq : ex - time ] ) and ( [ eq : in - time ] ) , the equations for the schwarzschild time coordinates , @xmath63 , are obtained as @xmath64 thus , from equations ( [ eq : initial ] ) and ( [ eq : time - eq ] ) , the equations for the relations between @xmath63 and @xmath61 are given by @xmath65 the above equations can be integrated easily to give the solution for @xmath66 in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 s are integration constants .",
    "there is a coordinate singularity on the killing horizon ; @xmath63 becomes infinite on @xmath70 .",
    "for further calculation the null coordinate is convenient since we are interested in the null geodesics in this space - time .",
    "hence , we shall adopt the kruscal null coordinates which has no coordinate singularity . outside the horizon in the @xmath9-th region , @xmath71 , the kruscal null coordinate is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to the retarded time and the advanced time . using these kruscal coordinates , the line element in the @xmath9-th region",
    "is expressed as @xmath75    similarly to the schwarzschild time coordinate , two pairs of kruscal null coordinates , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are assigned to each shell . using equation ( [ eq : time - sol ] ) ,",

    "this means that the @xmath9-th shell with @xmath79 is located in the white hole part of the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "this situation occurs for the shells beyond the horizon scale .",
    "the determination of the integration constants @xmath69 corresponds to the choice of the initial hypersurface .",
    "the procedure to construct the initial hypersurface we adopt is summarized as follows ; first , we choose a unit spacelike vector @xmath81 which is directed outward in the ordinary sense with respect to @xmath82 . taking this vector as a starting tangential vector , we extend a spacelike geodesic curve until it reaches the second shell .",
    "this spacelike geodesic curve defines the simultaneous hypersurface in the region between the first shell and the second shell .",
    "next we extend from this intersection towards the third shell another spacelike geodesic which starts from another spacelike vector at the second shell .",
    "this second spacelike geodesic generates a spacelike hypersurface in this region .",
    "repeating this process , we complete the whole initial hypersurface .    from the above procedure",
    ", the integration constant of equation ( [ eq : time - sol ] ) is determined as follows . in the @xmath9-th region ,",
    "the tangent vector of the spacelike geodesic is written as @xmath83 and the other components vanish , where @xmath84 is an integration constant associated with the geodesic equation and will be determined by the condition which we will see in the next section . from equation ( [ eq : sg - comp ] ) , the equation for the trajectory of the spacelike geodesic in the @xmath85 plane is given by @xmath86 integrating the above equation , we obtain @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is an integration constant .",
    "initially , we set @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "then , since @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we find @xmath94 and @xmath95 . from the above recurrent relation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath96.\\ ] ] using these relations , we obtain the integration constants , @xmath69 , for @xmath97 as @xmath98 -(\\sigma_{i}\\pm2\\nu_{i})\\ln { \\sqrt{\\sigma_{i}x_{i}+\\nu_{i}^{2 } } -(\\sigma_{i}\\pm\\nu_{i})\\over \\sqrt{\\sigma_{i}x_{i}+\\nu_{i}^{2 } } + ( \\sigma_{i}\\pm\\nu_{i } ) } -t_{(\\pm)i}(x_{i}),\\ ] ] and for @xmath99 as @xmath100      we consider a light ray which is emitted from each shell toward an observer at the center .",
    "the light ray goes along a future directed ingoing radial null geodesic , where `` ingoing '' refers to the direction from a shell toward shells labeled by a smaller number .",
    "an ingoing radial null geodesic is specified by a constant @xmath74 in the kruscal null coordinate . the circumferential radius of the @xmath9-th shell when it intersects the null geodesic is denoted by @xmath101 . the outermost shell considered here",
    "is labeled by @xmath102 . then @xmath103 and hence in the @xmath102-th region",
    ", @xmath104 is satisfied along the null geodesic .",
    "thus , on the @xmath105-th shell , the following relation holds @xmath106 this equation determines @xmath107 .",
    "we obtain the circumferential radii of all the shells at the intersection with the null geodesic by the same procedure , i.e. , by solving the following recurrent relation : @xmath108 we can determine @xmath101 from the given @xmath109 through this equation .    in order to derive the expression of redshift , we first write down the components of the null geodesic tangent in the @xmath9-th region , @xmath110 , which is given in the kruscal null coordinate as @xmath111 and the other components vanish , where @xmath112 is an integration constant associated with the geodesic equation .",
    "we require that the observed frequency of the photon at each shell is uniquely determined .",
    "the observed frequency , @xmath113 , at the @xmath9-th shell is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 equations ( [ eq : freq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : freq2 ] ) gives the relation between @xmath113 and @xmath116 , for @xmath97 , as @xmath117 where @xmath118 for the first region , a direct calculation leads to @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the frequency of the light ray observed by an observer rest at the origin @xmath7 .",
    "thus , using the above relations , we obtain the redshift of the light ray emitted from the @xmath9-th shell toward the observer rest at @xmath7 in the form @xmath121    our next task is to find the angular diameter ",
    "distance @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 is @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the physical length of the source perpendicular to the line of sight , and @xmath124 is the observed angular size . since the space we are considering is spherically symmetric , the diameter distance from the observer at the center to the @xmath9-th shell agrees with the circumferential radius @xmath125 when the null geodesic intersects it ; @xmath126    we calculate @xmath0@xmath1 relation in the dust  shell universe using the relations ( [ recurrent ] ) , ( [ redshift ] ) and ( [ diameter ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the choice of the parameters and the initial hypersurface determines the behavior of a dust  shell universe .",
    "since we are interested in cases which have a fl limit , we set the parameters so that they approach a fl model in the large @xmath57 limit .",
    "for most cases described below , we set the mass distribution of shells as @xmath127 at the initial slice .",
    "this is not a unique but the simplest case which goes to a fl model in the large @xmath57 limit .",
    "using @xmath128 , we define @xmath129 and @xmath130 by @xmath131 in terms of fl models , @xmath129 and @xmath130 may be regarded as the `` hubble constant '' and `` hubble horizon radius '' .",
    "however , we can not say anything at this stage about what relation they have with the hubble constant and horizon scale of fl models .    for @xmath56 , we put @xmath132 with a constant interval @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 is some positive integer . here",
    "note that @xmath136 and the following relation holds @xmath137 hence @xmath138 corresponds to the `` mean schwarzschild radius '' of the @xmath139-th and @xmath140-th regions .",
    "before we proceed , we estimate the magnitude of the radiation - like term in equation ( [ expa ] ) . from equations ( [ eq : g - mass ] ) and ( [ eq : gmass - def ] ) with @xmath141 , we find @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a positive integer . from equations ( [ eq : curvature ] ) ( [ eq : defk ] ) and ( [ eq : dmass - def ] ) , we find @xmath144 and obtain @xmath145 thus , when we consider a large @xmath57 limit with fixing @xmath146 , the baryonic mass @xmath147 is regarded as a small quantity , compared with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "that is , the radiation - like term is of order @xmath150 of the first term and can be neglected when @xmath139 is large .",
    "as described in the previous section , the choice of @xmath151 corresponds to choice of initial hypersurface . in a fl model ,",
    "the simultaneous hypersurface is orthogonal to the trajectory of matter .",
    "thus , we try choosing @xmath151 so that the vector @xmath81 is orthogonal to the trajectory of each shell ( we will refer to this choice as `` model a '' ) . from the condition @xmath152 at @xmath153 , we obtain @xmath154    in figure 2 we plot the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift of each shell for various @xmath135 with a common @xmath129 in the case of model a. the total number of shells @xmath155 is taken to be @xmath156 .",
    "we emit a photon toward the center from each shell so that every photon reaches at the center simultaneously .",
    "we have obtained a surprising result that all the curves are quite similar even in the case when we put only two shells within the initial horizon radius ; the deviation among the curves is at most about @xmath157 . on the other hand",
    ", it can be also seen that the slope at higher redshifts becomes steeper as we decrease the number of shells .",
    "we compare the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in the dust ",
    "shell universe obtained above with that of a fl model .",
    "we here adopt a spatially flat fl model , since the `` curvature '' term in the expansion law of a dust  shell ( [ expa ] ) vanishes .",
    "moreover , when @xmath139 is large , the `` radiation '' term is negligible compared to the first term .",
    "thus , in this paper , we focus on the cases with large @xmath158 , and compare them with a spatially flat fl model filled only with non - relativistic matter .",
    "the cases with small @xmath159 will be mentioned later .",
    "the hubble equation in this flat fl model is @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "the relation between the redshift and the scale factor in fl models is @xmath162 where subscript `` @xmath163 '' denotes a value when the observer receives the photon .",
    "thus we can write the present hubble parameter @xmath164 in terms of the initial hubble parameter @xmath165 and redshift @xmath166 as @xmath167 the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in the flat fl model is calculated once we fix @xmath168 and @xmath166 , since the relation is determined solely by @xmath169 .",
    "the dashed line in figure 2 shows the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in the flat fl model with @xmath170 .",
    "the redshift of the initial hypersurface is identified with the redshift of the outermost shell for the case @xmath171 , i.e. , @xmath172 .",
    "the deviation of the dust ",
    "shell universe from the flat fl model with @xmath173 amounts to about @xmath174 around the maximum of the curve .",
    "we have confirmed that the deviation from the fl model becomes small as we increase @xmath139 . for smaller",
    "@xmath139 , however , the redshift of the outermost shell becomes small , resulting a larger @xmath169 from the relation ( [ frw ] ) .",
    "we show in figure 3 the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in the dust ",
    "shell universe in the case of @xmath175(solid line ) and that in the flat fl model with @xmath170 and @xmath176 ( long dashed line ) . in this case",
    ", the deviation amounts to about @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , the difference lies not only in the normalization of @xmath169 , but also in the shape of the curve . to see this",
    ", we also plotted a fl curve ( short dashed line ) with a hubble parameter changed by @xmath157 : @xmath177 .",
    "note that the change in the hubble parameter of the fl model only results in the change in the normalization of the curve .",
    "we see that the slope at higher redshifts is steeper in the dust",
    " shell universe than in the fl model .",
    "it is also clear from figure 2 that this tendency becomes strong as we decrease @xmath139 .",
    "thus , we can say that for large @xmath139 , the flat fl model approximates the dust ",
    "shell universe quite well , but as we decrease @xmath178 , this fit becomes poorer .    in the next subsection",
    "we discuss the reason of this behavior by studying the behavior of averaged density , and try to reduce the deviation from fl models without increasing @xmath139 .",
    "we usually regard a fl model as a large - scale `` average '' of a locally inhomogeneous universe .",
    "we will study the relation between the results obtained in the previous section and an `` averaged '' density of the dust  shell universe .",
    "we consider an averaged density around the observer at the center .",
    "the averaged density is defined by dividing the mass contained within some radius by the 3-volume on the hypersurface up to that radius .",
    "we will study the behavior of the averaged density when the radius to take the average is gradually increased , and discuss its relation with the distance  redshift relation .",
    "first let us consider the 3-volume on the initial hypersurface defined in the previous section . from equation ( [ eq : sg - comp ] )",
    ", the intrinsic metric of the initial hypersurface is given by @xmath179 using the above line element , we obtain the spatial volume , @xmath180 , of the @xmath9-th region ( @xmath181 ) on the initial slice in the form @xmath182^{r_i}_{r_{i-1}}\\\\ & + & { 5\\pi { \\mu_i}^3 \\over 2(1+e_i^2)^{7/2 } } \\ln \\left ( { \\sqrt{(1+e_i^2)r_i-{\\mu_i } } + \\sqrt{(1+e_i^2)r_i } \\over \\sqrt{(1+e_i^2)r_{i-1}-{\\mu_i } } + \\sqrt{(1+e_i^2)r_{i-1 } } } \\right ) \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath99 , @xmath183 is equal to @xmath184 .    using this volume , we define the averaged density @xmath185 as follows .",
    "we sum the baryonic masses up to the @xmath8-th shell and half of the @xmath9-th shell , and divided the sum by the 3-volume inside the @xmath9-th shell ; @xmath186",
    "it seems natural to take this sum of masses in averaging , since the motion of the @xmath9-th shell is approximately determined by sum of the gravitational mass inside the shell ( which agrees with the sum of baryonic masses up to @xmath8-th shell ) and half of its baryonic mass ; the numerator in the above definition is the same with @xmath187 which appears in the first term in the expansion law ( [ motion ] ) .",
    "we plotted in figure 4 the averaged density @xmath185 for the model described in the previous section . as expected , @xmath185 is almost constant near @xmath128 , which may explain the reason the deviation of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in the dust ",
    "shell models from the fl curves is small .",
    "however , the averaged density slightly becomes smaller at the outside region than @xmath128 defined by the expansion law .",
    "the reason is explained as follows . the volume , @xmath74 , between @xmath32 and @xmath188 is expanded in terms of @xmath189 as @xmath190 where @xmath191 . substituting the expression of @xmath192 , we can expand @xmath74 in terms of @xmath193 to find @xmath194 we see that the volume becomes larger than that of a homogeneous model .",
    "this effect is significant especially when @xmath195 , i.e. , beyond the horizon scale , which explains the behavior of the averaged density at large @xmath9 in figure 4 . from this figure",
    ", one may think we can reduce the deviation from the fl model by adjusting the expansion law so that the averaged density is a constant value .",
    "we plotted the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in this case ( model b ) and the corresponding fl curve for @xmath196 in figure 5 ( the solid line and the long dashed line ) .",
    "we adjust @xmath50 in the expansion law iteratively so that the relation @xmath197 is satisfied . as a result , @xmath50 is not homogeneous ; it increases as @xmath9 increases ( figure 6 ) . from figure 5",
    ", we see that the difference between the dust  shell universe and",
    "the fl model remains the same as figure 3 , although the averaged density is indeed a constant .",
    "we can take an initial hypersurface in which both @xmath50 and @xmath185 is homogeneous by requiring the relation @xmath198 we plot the @xmath0@xmath1 relation of this model ( model c ) in figure 7 . comparing with figure 2",
    ", we see that the difference among the curves is reduced .",
    "figure 8 illustrates the good agreement between the @xmath0@xmath1 relations of the dust  shell model and a fl model for the case @xmath175 .",
    "here we check whether the assumption of constant interval @xmath199 is essential or not .",
    "we try some patterns of the initial circumferential radius of the shells @xmath56 , for instance , @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are some positive constants and @xmath203 . when @xmath204 , the distribution of shells becomes sparser ( denser ) for larger @xmath9 .",
    "we have found that the results are unchanged .",
    "we also try another pattern @xmath205 with @xmath206 .",
    "we plotted the result when @xmath175 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 ( model d ) in figure 9 according to @xmath155 when we impose the condition @xmath209 ; if we increase @xmath155 , the maximum value allowed for @xmath202 becomes small .",
    "the value of @xmath202 adopted here is about the maximum value for @xmath210 . ] .",
    "we can see that the deviation from the fl model remains small .",
    "we can take another interesting choice ; the expansion law is homogeneous ( characterized by @xmath128 ) , and the averaged density is also homogeneous , but each quantity differs ; @xmath211 ( model e ) .",
    "this is realized by imposing a condition of the form @xmath212 with @xmath213 . in figure 10 , we show the result in the case @xmath214 and @xmath215 ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed lines are curves in a fl model .",
    "the upper one uses the original `` hubble constant''(eq.([hubbleconst ] ) , i.e. , @xmath216 , and the lower one uses the parameter changed by the same amount with the change in the volume , i.e. , @xmath217 .",
    "we see that the shape of the curve differs from a fl curve ( compare with figure 8) .",
    "this indicates that the averaged density should agree with @xmath128 which determines the expansion law , in order for the @xmath0@xmath1 relation to behave like that of a fl model .",
    "it should be also noted that the fl curve with the changed hubble parameter is closer to the curve in dust ",
    "shell universe than the other .",
    "this may indicate that the `` observed '' hubble parameter is closer to the averaged density @xmath218 , rather than @xmath128 which determines the expansion law .",
    "here we summarize our results .",
    "* model a : the initial hypersurface is orthogonal to each trajectory of shells and the expansion law is homogeneous ; @xmath219 .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 relation of the dust  shell universe shows deviation from the fl curve , especially when @xmath139 is small ( figs.2,3 ) .",
    "the averaged density @xmath218 is not constant ( fig.4 ) . *",
    "model b : we adjust @xmath50 so that @xmath220 is satisfied ( fig.6 ) on the same initial hypersurface as model a. the deviation from the fl curve is not reduced ( fig.5 ) . * model c : we choose the initial hypersurface so that the relation @xmath221 is satisfied .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 relation of the dust ",
    "shell universe shows good agreement with the fl curve ( figs.7,8 ) . *",
    "model d : the choice of the initial hypersurface is same with model c , but the interval of the shells is not constant ( eqs.([int1]),([int2 ] ) ) . the deviation of @xmath0@xmath1 relation of the dust ",
    "shell universe from the fl curve remains small ( fig.9 ) .",
    "* model e : the averaged density @xmath185 and the parameter @xmath50 are homogeneous but @xmath222 .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 relation of the dust ",
    "shell universe shows mild deviation from the fl curve ( fig.10 ) .    from these results ,",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in a dust ",
    "shell universe looks like a flat fl universe , when the expansion law resembles the flat fl model , and the behavior of averaged density field is scale - independent when we increase the scale of averaging , and the averaged density agrees with @xmath128 .",
    "this statement seems to be valid even in the cases with quite small number of the shells .",
    "however , the situation is not so simple . in small @xmath139 cases , the radiation - like term in the expansion law can not be neglected .",
    "one may expect that a fl model with radiation term gives a better fitting to those cases , but we have found this does not work .",
    "this implies that we can not tell the effect of homogeneities just by studying the expansion law .",
    "we need more detailed study to this problem , which is left for our future work .",
    "we also note that in spatially flat cases the gravitational mass and the baryonic mass coincide ; whether we use the baryonic mass or gravitational mass in defining the averaged density , the result is the same . in cases where those masses are different , we have to be careful in determining the averaged density when we try to construct a fl model which fits a dust  shell universe . in order to clarify",
    "which mass we should use to construct a fitting fl model , we have to study non - zero @xmath55 cases , which will also be done in our future paper .",
    "we have studied the behavior of @xmath0@xmath1 relation in a spherically symmetric dust ",
    "shell universe where the mass distribution is discrete .",
    "we have compared the relation of dust ",
    "shell universe with that of fl models , and discussed the relation with the behavior of averaged density .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath0@xmath1 relation observed at the center agrees well with that of a flat fl model if the following conditions are satisfied : ( i ) the expansion law of the circumferential radius of the shells resembles the hubble equation of a spatially flat fl model , ( ii ) the behavior of averaged density around the observer at the center is scale - independent as we increase the scale on which we take the average , and ( iii ) the averaged density agrees with the energy density of the fl model .",
    "we have also seen that the choice of initial hypersurface relates the expansion law to the averaged density .",
    "the effect of discreteness of mass distribution appears in the equation of motion of each dust  shell . this effect becomes smaller as we increase the number density of shell .",
    "we conclude the discreteness of matter distribution itself is of no significance in this model in discussing the observed quantities such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as long as the expansion law and the averaged density field is homogeneous in the sense described above .",
    "this supports the averaging hypothesis that a universe is described by a fl model if the universe is homogeneous when the density is averaged on some scale larger than the scale of the inhomogeneities .",
    "we need , however , further discussion for the cases when the number of shells is extremely small , and when the curvature term does not vanish .",
    "we also note that it will be interesting to study cases where the averaged density is inhomogeneous or non - radial null rays travel , to see cosmological lensing effects .",
    "these problems are left for our future work .",
