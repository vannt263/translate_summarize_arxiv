    "suppression of the low - energy part of bremsstrahlung from ultrarelativistic electrons passing through an amorphous scattering medium is the celebrated lpm - effect @xcite , named after landau and pomeranchuk who predicted it qualitatively @xcite , and migdal @xcite who provided an accurate theory for bremsstrahlung in a semi - infinite uniform medium .",
    "it has also been studied for finite - thickness targets @xcite , and for the opposite limit of thin target , which is of intrinsic interest @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions were accurately tested experimentally only within the last two decades @xcite , and the theoretical and experimental state of the art is reviewed in @xcite .    a natural further step , both for practice and for theory , is to study composite targets .",
    "one of the simplest configurations thereof is a sequence of thin plates with a gap between them comparable to the photon formation length @xmath1 the latter quantity depends on the electron energy @xmath2 and photon energy @xmath0 in the window covered by the detector , @xmath3 standing for the electron mass .",
    "the problem of structured target as applied to the gamma - quantum emission , was first discussed by blankenbecler @xcite , who treated it at the basis of the model for multiple scattering devised in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , other authors @xcite extended their formalisms to handle this problem .",
    "an experimental verification of the existence of interference effects in bremsstrahlung on compound targets has recently been undertaken at cern @xcite .",
    "it was emphasized @xcite that high electron energy allows achieving macroscopic values for the photon formation length ( [ l_f - def ] ) , and thereby study its manifestations simply by tuning the distance between the scattering plates by a micrometer screw .",
    "but even for cern energies , @xmath4 gev , the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ l_f - def ] ) amounts only @xmath5 m , wherefore to make @xmath6 practically macroscopic ( @xmath7 mm ) , one needs to consider sufficiently small photon energies compared to @xmath2 , which then renders the problem essentially classical . at the same time , condition @xmath8 can be safely fulfilled , wherewith the contribution from transition radiation may be neglected .",
    "the experiment @xcite conducted at such conditions favored the theory @xcite , but also found some departures from it , and , surprisingly , from other theoretical predictions , which were expected to be more accurate .    to clarify the origin of remaining discrepancies",
    ", it may be instructive to recollect underlying assumptions for the theories at the market .",
    "it is fair to say that blankenbecler and drell @xcite in essence extended landau and pomeranchuk s approach @xcite to cover the case of finite - thickness target , and incorporate quantum effects . at that , a simplified model of scattering in a medium was adopted , in which transverse dimensions of the target random field exceeded that of the electron wave packet , allowing to exactly integrate over electron impact parameters and to reduce the photon emission amplitude to an integral over particle trajectory , like in classical mechanics .",
    "a strong simplification was made then , in the spirit of @xcite , by replacing the medium average of an oscillatory integrand by the corresponding oscillatory function of averaged variables .",
    "that yielded the angle - integral spectrum in the form of a double time integral , which for most cases of interest had to be computed numerically .",
    "along these lines , blankenbecler @xcite evaluated the spectrum of radiation on @xmath9 plates , and discovered an additional maximum , or  shoulder \" in the region where the gap width becomes commensurable with the radiation coherence length .",
    "the approach of blankenbecler and drell has the merit of being simple and qualitatively correct .",
    "however , it suffers from a lack of accuracy due to the oversimplified averaging ( the neglect of fluctuations ) , which may be essential for comparison with experiments .",
    "an attempt to improve it was undertaken in blankenbecler s later paper @xcite , where a correlation of the amplitude and the phase of the integrand in the double time integral was taken into account , while other fluctuations were neglected , as before . as we will show , however , the correction so evaluated improves the accuracy only for the case of weak scattering in the plates , whilst in the opposite case of strong ( non - dipole ) scattering , in which interference effects are actually the strongest , this correction is rather counterproductive .",
    "almost simultaneously with @xcite , zakharov @xcite advanced with a calculation of the lpm effect in finite targets including proper averaging .",
    "it was built upon techniques originally developed for particle physics , notably the impact parameter representation .",
    "the merit of the latter is that it naturally invokes fourier transforms of scattering - angle distribution functions , which from solution of the kinetic equation express as simple exponentials of the fourier - transformed scattering differential cross - section .",
    "the main attention in papers @xcite was payed to a single finite - thickness target , while for structured target , the results were presented only graphically .",
    "zakharov noticed that the interference features in his calculated spectrum were less pronounced than those in @xcite , albeit attributed that to the crudeness of the blankenbecler - drell model for scattering medium , rather than to an oversimplification of their averaging procedure .",
    "shortly after , baier and katkov @xcite proposed a technique which allowed them to handle the case of @xmath9 scattering plates analytically . to this end ,",
    "an alternative form of the double time integral representation for the radiation spectrum was adopted , and radiation spectra for @xmath9 plates were calculated by mathematical induction , assuming all the plates to be identical , equidistant , and the scattering angle distributions in them to be gaussian .",
    "the influence of the transition radiation was taken into account too , which can be valuable for lower - energy experiments .",
    "baier and katkov ultimately restricted their analysis to the case of plates infinitesimally thin compared to the gap width , and demonstrated that instead of one maximum , the radiation spectrum features a sequence of maxima and minima of decreasing amplitude .",
    "the common drawback shared by all the abovementioned approaches is that the resulting expressions for the radiation spectrum are rather unwieldy , and relations of the spectral features with physical parameters in the problem remain obscure .",
    "what is more serious , however , is that it led to a number of qualitative controversies in the literature , the most noticeable among which are the following :    * it was suggested in @xcite that the position of the greatest spectral maximum corresponds to a situation when the photon formation length ( [ l_f - def ] ) matches the distance between the plate centres . but in that case , the resonance condition ought to involve an additional factor @xmath10 , as in coherent bremsstrahlung ( see @xcite ) . however , therewith it would definitely contradict the experiment @xcite . * in the integral expressing the radiation spectrum , the oscillating function typically has the argument @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electron s lorentz factor , and @xmath13 the radiation angle .",
    "the use of the latter expression suggests that for the distance @xmath14 between the plate centers , the main spectral maximum should be located at @xmath15 involving factor @xmath10 , as expected , but also a denominator @xmath16 , which might compensate it .",
    "practically , though , it is not a priori obvious , with respect to which direction the radiation angles should be counted , and what are their typical values . if one estimates them as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the rms scattering angle in the plates @xcite , then for @xmath19 the compensation between the @xmath10 factor and the denominator can be significant . but numerically , such estimates still contradict the experimental findings @xcite . * concerning the comparative strength of the contributions from the enhancement region and the suppression region at low @xmath0 , it is unobvious whether their integrated effect must be zero , as suggested in @xcite , or the suppression must dominate in the total energy losses , as one might anticipate from the migdal s theory @xcite of radiation in a thick target , where no enhancement manifests itself in the spectrum at all .    in the absence of cogent explanation for those controversies , the state of the theory can hardly be regarded as satisfactory .",
    "besides that , it is becoming desirable further to consider the case of plates of unequal thickness , and to fully scrutinize the role of non - gaussian ( coulomb ) tails in scattering , insofar as approaches of baier and katkov , as well as blankenbecler and drell rested on gaussian description of scattering .",
    "given rather fundamental significance of the present problem , it makes sense at present to reappraise its theoretical treatment . in this paper",
    "we shall derive physically more transparent representations for the radiation spectrum , which will help clarify the matter as a whole , and at the same time improve the numerical accuracy . to simplify the problem",
    ", we will consider the case of two _ thin _ scattering plates ( foils ) , which allows avoiding double time integral representations for the radiation spectrum .",
    "we will also limit ourselves to classical electrodynamics , and neglect the transition radiation , which are good approximations for the performed experiments @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we will investigate in more detail the influence of coulomb corrections . to alleviate the connection between the theory and the experiment , we introduce appropriate visibilities of the interference pattern .",
    "we will be able to resolve the controversies alluded above , and to correct abundant numerical errors existing in the literature .",
    "ultimately , we compare our predictions with the recent experimental data , and show that there is no significant discrepancy between the experiment and the theory .",
    "in classical electrodynamics , the spectral - angular energy distribution of radiation ( with vector @xmath20 marking the direction of photon emission ) expresses in a known way through the charged particle trajectory @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23}\\frac{d}{dt } \\frac{\\bm{n}\\times\\bm{v}(t)}{1-\\bm{n}\\cdot \\bm{v}(t ) } \\right|^2,\\ ] ] @xmath24 being the electron charge . for our present study",
    ", it will suffice to consider the simplest case when the electron experiences 2 abrupt scatterings , at instants @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 integration over the time in eq .",
    "( [ init - t - int ] ) trivially yields    [ eq2 ] @xmath28,\\label{expand - sum - sq - j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 eq .",
    "( [ expand - sum - sq - ja ] ) implies that if scatterings are well separated , the spectral radiation amplitude can be viewed as a sum of spectral amplitudes of radiation at single scatterings ( with a distance- and @xmath0-dependent phase shift @xmath32 between them ) . that may be conceived as the absence of effects of temporarily nonequilibrium proper field on the radiation amplitude level",
    ". however , observed in practice is the radiation intensity , which is proportional to the amplitude square .",
    "it differs from a sum of intensities on separate plates , engaging certain dependence on @xmath0 through the cosine of the phase shift between the scatterings .",
    "an important generic property of eq .",
    "( [ expand - sum - sq - j ] ) is that the @xmath0-integral of the interference term therein strictly vanishes : @xmath33 by virtue of the relation @xmath34,\\ ] ] and strictly non - zero value of the argument of the @xmath35-function for @xmath36 .",
    "the absence of interference in the total radiative energy loss at successive random scatterings has a simple physical reason : equivalently , it can be expressed as a _ time _ integral of the particle acceleration squared , in which time - separated scatterings obviously give non - interfering contributions @xcite : @xmath37 hence , if a suppression occurs in one region of the spectrum ( typically at lowest @xmath0 where it is associated with the lpm effect ) , it should be accompanied by a commensurable _ enhancement _ in some other region ( which is natural to call the anti - lpm effect ) .",
    "the established property is undoubtedly general and must hold as well for a number of scatterings greater than 2 .",
    "but it may contradict our experience that in a target with @xmath35-correlated scatterings , interference effects to the spectrum are purely suppressive , and there is seemingly no enhancement region at all @xcite . the contradiction is resolved if one takes into account that in condensed matter , distances between atoms are very short indeed , being usually far shorter than photon formation length . specifically , if we consider inequality @xmath38 where _ quantum _ arguments stipulate that @xmath39 , condition ( [ aa - gg - lf ] ) is fulfilled already at @xmath40 mev . in the latter ( quite ubiquitous ) case",
    ", the radiation spectrum reaches its quantum end at @xmath41 sooner than the radiation enhancement can develop .",
    "therefore , the spectral enhancement has no room to develop , and the suppression dominates both locally and globally @xcite .",
    "one could imagine that for gaseous targets , where distances between atoms are much greater than @xmath42 , the situation might change , but in the latter case , it is essential that @xmath43 should be regarded as a random variable .",
    "we will return to effects of randomization of @xmath43 in sec .",
    "[ sec : randomization ] , and demonstrate that the anti - lpm effect still manifests itself on a scale of photon formation length comparable with the range of _ anti_-correlation , which is of order of atomic size , again .",
    "meanwhile , we will concentrate on studying the case of radiation on two scattering foils with definite and macroscopic separation .    before we proceed",
    ", however , there is another observation worth making .",
    "for bremsstrahlung in a sufficiently thin layer of substance , a fair approximation is the smallness of scattering angles ( dipole limit ) , when @xmath44 . in that case , the structure of currents ( [ j21-def])([j32-def ] ) appreciably simplifies .",
    "linearizing @xmath45 in @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 , integrating over radiation angles , and averaging ( [ expand - sum - sq - j ] ) over scattering angles @xmath49 , @xmath50 yields @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "since in most cases , successive scatterings are not causally connected , the correlator in ( [ g ] ) reduces to a product of mean scattering angles : @xmath55 for amorphous targets , mean deflection angles are obviously zero , wherefore the whole interference in the spectrum in this approximation vanishes . to preserve the interference effects between the targets ,",
    "one thus needs either to render both scatterings asymmetric are challenging to manufacture .",
    "more compact deflectors could be created with the aid of lasers , as proposed in @xcite , or bent crystals . ] , or to arrange _ non - dipole _",
    "conditions for radiation in the amorphous target , which may be simpler to bring into practice , and will be the subject of our study in what follows .",
    "to make our presentation self - contained , before addressing interference effects in a composite target , let us recapitulate the properties of bremsstrahlung on a single amorphous foil .",
    "this section gives the account of relevant formulae , highlighting the differences between gaussian and molire averaging procedures , as well as between frameworks of different authors .",
    "we will also propose two our own recipes for incorporating coulomb corrections , which give a reasonable balance between precision and simplicity for the addressed case .",
    "radiation spectrum at scattering to a definite angle of arbitrary size ( which is small by absolute value , but may be sizable compared with the typical radiation angle @xmath56 ) expresses by an integral ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 small - angle expansion of ( [ f - def ] ) can be obtained as    @xmath59    series ( [ f - dipole - series ] ) has finite ( actually , unit ) convergence radius , which is natural in view of the presence in ( [ f - def ] ) of the structure @xmath60 .    the large - angle asymptotics of ( [ f - def ] ) is logarithmic : @xmath61 the logarithm here stems from the fact that although for a large - angle scattering , the radiation cones from the initial and final electron lines are well separated , the region between them is filled by an enhanced radiation , owing to the interference between the cones .",

    ", it may suffice to note that according to migdal s calculation , typical @xmath0 at which lpm effect develops are @xmath331 , where @xmath332 is the range at which the angle of multiple scattering becomes comparable with the radiation angle @xmath56 .",
    "hence , @xmath333 , and owing to the presence of factor @xmath334 , this range is at least by 4 orders of magnitude greater than typical interatomic distance ( a few units of @xmath42 ) , which must constitute the scale for @xmath325 .",
    "therefore , anti - lpm enhancement in atomic matter must be virtually invisible indeed , reconciling its principal existence with the conventional theories of the lpm effect . put differently , @xmath335 can be effectively sent to zero , justifying the formal use of the @xmath35-correlated model of multiple scattering employed by migdal @xcite .",
    "in course of our study , we arrived at the following conclusions :    * for scattering foils with macroscopic and fixed separation , the lpm - like suppression of bremsstrahlung at lowest @xmath0 is accompanied by an adjacent enhancement , which can be called the anti - lpm effect .",

    "the dominant contribution to the interference term stems from photon emission angles close to @xmath149 , such that @xmath336 .",
