    "bragg gratings ( bgs ) are light - controlling structures produced by a periodic variation of the refractive index along an optical fiber or waveguide .",
    "devices based on fiber gratings , such as dispersion compensators , sensors , elements of laser cavities , etc . , are widely used in optical systems ka:99 .",
    "gap solitons ( gss ) in fiber gratings , alias bg solitons stsi:94 , are supported through the balance between the bg - induced dispersion , which incorporates the bandgap in the system s linear spectrum , and the kerr nonlinearity of the fiber or waveguide .",
    "analytical solutions for bg solitons in the standard fiber - grating model are well known acwa:89,chjo:89 .",
    "slightly more than half of the analytical found family is stable , as first demonstrated , within the framework of the variational approximation , in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then in a consistent numerical form in ref .",
    "later , an accurate numerical technique for simulations of gss was elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a rigorous analysis of their stability was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite    following the theoretical prediction , bg solitons were created in the experiment , using a relatively short bg written in the cladding of an optical fiber @xcite and a virtual optically - induced grating coen:04 . in particular , an essential physical achievement was the creation of slow bg solitons moving at the velocity much lower than the velocity of light @xmath0 in vacuum ( namely , @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "gss are one of fundamental species of solitons in optics , as well as in other nonlinear media .",
    "in particular , the gs concept was extended to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , where such solitons were predicted in a condensate loaded into a periodic potential ( optical lattice ) bako:02,oski:03,br:04 , and then created in the experiment @xcite .",
    "an issue of great significance to the fundamental studies and applications is the development of methods for control of bg solitons .",
    "one of them is _ apodization _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the use of a grating with the bragg reflectivity gradually varying along the fiber ( or waveguide ) . in particular ,",
    "a possibility was predicted to slow down the soliton and eventually bring it to a halt in a properly apodized bg mama:04 .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown that the apodization helps to couple solitons into fiber gratings @xcite , and may also split them @xcite .",
    "the retardation of the bg solitons to the above - mentioned low velocity , @xmath1 , was also performed with the help of the apodization @xcite .",
    "technologies which make it possible to fabricate regular fiber gratings with periodic apodization , i.e. , an effective _ superlattice _ built on top of the bg , are well established @xcite .",
    "analysis of the light propagation in the so developed _ supergratings _ was performed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the supergrating gives rise to extra gaps in the system s spectrum (  rowland ghost gaps \" ) .",
    "solitons in the gaps were looked for in an approximation based on  supercoupled - mode equations \" , which , essentially , assume that a soliton amounts to a slowly varying envelope of the supergrating s bloch function(s ) .",
    "as is known , such an approximation ( the averaging method ) generally applies to the description of gss near bandgap edges @xcite .",
    "a related problem was considered in @xcite , _",
    "viz_. , gss in the bec loaded into a double - periodic optical lattice .",
    "the period doubling opens an additional narrow  mini - gap \" , where stable gss exist .",
    "the objective of our work is to investigate the existence of gss in harmonic superlattices created on top of the usual bg in fibers or waveguides with the intrinsic kerr nonlinearity , extending the analysis initiated in yame:05 .",
    "our model has periodic potentials in one spatial dimension .",
    "analytical approaches for gss in two or more spatial dimensions were also developed recently in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give our mathematical model of the supergrating and analyze the bandgap structure in the model , using its dispersion relation , in section  [ s : prl ] .",
    "this constitutes a non - trivial extension of the classical spectral theory for the mathieu equation smjo:99 , and predicts parameter values at which gss may be expected to exist in the model .",
    "the sequence of new bandgaps not present in the unmodulated bg is produced . in sections  [",
    "s : mel ] and [ s : av ] we establish the existence of gss in the newly opened bandgaps , using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "we find various families of gss in the supergrating , including those which do not exist in the ordinary gs model ( in particular , stable asymmetric solitons , and multi - soliton bound states ) .",
    "using the melnikov method , we first prove that gss in the original bg model have counterparts in the extended model .",
    "a similar treatment was used for a perturbed hamiltonian partial differential equations in @xcite .",
    "then , the method of averaging is used to demonstrate the emergence of gss in the new bandgaps .",
    "the most important result is that in each new bandgap , there is a single family of fundamental symmetric gss which _ entirely _ fills the gap .",
    "such gss near band edges in nonlinear schrdinger equations with periodic potentials were also studied by different approaches in hwakya:11,pesuki:04 . in section  [",
    "s : bif ] we discuss bifurcations of gss from a geometric point of view and illustrate this general approach in numerical computations for our problem .",
    "the majority of the newly established gss are _ stable _ solutions of the model equations .",
    "in particular , the family of fundamental gss in the new bandgaps is stable even for negative frequencies , when the ordinary gss are unstable @xcite .",
    "we do not study the stability of gss in this paper in detail , referring to @xcite for the verification of the stability by means of direct simulations .",
    "the standard model of the bragg grating ( bg ) in an optical fiber is based on the equations @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are amplitudes of the right- and left - propagating waves in the fiber . in these equations",

    "let us consider the case of @xmath22",
    ". for @xmath23 non - trivial solutions of ( [ e : uvlin ] ) emerge due to parametric resonance , similar to the situation in the classical mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect new gaps to open up at points @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we will denote the corresponding gaps by @xmath26 , while the central gap will be denoted by @xmath27 . in the central gap @xmath27 , gss for @xmath28",

    "for the non - central gaps , however , we will apply the averaging method to investigate the emergence of ( small ) gss for @xmath28 in section  [ s : av ] .",
    "straightforward perturbation theory for parametrically excited systems yields approximation to the gaps for small @xmath9 .",
    "for example , an approximation to the gap with @xmath30 close to @xmath31 , i.e. close to the unperturbed first gap at @xmath32 , can be obtained by looking for solutions of ( [ e : uvlin ] ) to lowest order approximation @xmath33 using this ansatz we derive at the solvability condition at order @xmath34 , @xmath35",

    "moreover , note that at the boundaries of the gaps periodic solutions with wavenumber @xmath37 or @xmath38 exist @xcite .",
    "hence , being interested in solutions with @xmath39 we introduce @xmath40 and expand ( [ e : solv ] ) for small @xmath41 to obtain @xmath42 a new gap appears if this quadratic equation for @xmath43 has no real solutions .",
    "thus we obtain as the condition for the gap , that @xmath44 in terms of the original parameter @xmath30 we find that the gaps open up at @xmath45 and their widths are @xmath46 similar expressions can be obtained for the higher - order gaps @xmath47 for @xmath48 showing that the gap width of the band corresponding to @xmath49 scales with @xmath50 .",
    "we can treat the case of @xmath51 similarly .",
    "these perturbative results can be extended numerically by detecting parameter values , for which eqs .",
    "( [ e : uvlin ] ) possesses periodic solutions with wavenumber @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "it is well known that these parameters form the boundary of the gaps in the spectrum ( compare with above ) .",

    "the shaded and white areas stand for bands and gaps , respectively .",
    "it is found that varying @xmath37 merely changes the width of bands and gaps with respect to @xmath53 , whereas changing @xmath52 leads to more complex effects . in particular , for @xmath54 gaps opening at @xmath29 can vanish again when @xmath55 or @xmath52 are increased .",
