    "the detection of long linear carbon - chain molecules in interstellar and circumstellar clouds has come as a surprise .",
    "ab initio calculation show that long linear species are usually more energetic than their ring or ring - chain isomers and are observed to be less stable in the earthbound environment . yet",
    "many linear chains , such as the cyanopolyynes hc@xmath5n , are found to be widespread and abundant in the cold circumstellar and interstellar clouds .",
    "this abundance of long chains and the scarcity of rings in the cold uv - shielded clouds yield keys to the formation of large molecules in interstellar space and , may be , can help us to understand to the origin of the diffuse interstellar bands @xcite .",
    "carbon chain molecules can be classified into several families , depending on the structure of their linear backbone ( acetylenic backbone with alternating single and triple carbon - carbon bonds , or cumulenic backbone with double bonds ) , on their electronic ground state ( open shell or closed shell ) and on their end groups ( h , cn , ch@xmath4 or ch@xmath10 ) .",
    "the two most widespread families are the polyynes ( hc@xmath5n and ch@xmath10c@xmath5h ) and the polyacetylenic radicals ( c@xmath11h ) .",
    "the most abundant is presumably the family of polyacetylenes ( hc@xmath1h ) , which , unfortunately are non - polar , hence not detectable at radio wavelengths .",
    "note , however , that these species have been detected in the mid infrared with the infrared space observatory @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the polyynes and carbon - chain radicals form directly in the gas phase through reactions of cch with polyynes , polyacetylenes and/or polyacetylenic ions ( e.g. hc@xmath5n + cch @xmath12 hc@xmath6n + h ) @xcite .",
    "such reactions tend to insert two triply bonded carbon atoms into the carbon backbone , uncoupling the formation of chains with an odd number of c - atoms from those with an even number , which could explain the alternance between high and low abundances observed as the length of the c backbone increases .",
    "for example , in the molecular shell around irc+10216 and in the dark cloud tmc1 , the two main astronomical sources of carbon chain molecules , the abundance of the c@xmath13h radicals with an _ even _ number of c - atoms is @xmath14 times larger than that of radicals of similar size with an _ odd _ number of carbon atoms .",
    "in contrast , the abundance decrement between successive species within the even ( or odd ) number of c - atoms families , c@xmath13h / c@xmath15h , is found to be only 4 - 6 @xcite .",
    "the same seems to apply to the chains terminated by cn : the abundance decrement between cyanopolyynes , hc@xmath5n / hc@xmath6n , is between 3 and 5 ( for n=1 - 4 ) , whereas hccn , the first member of the ` even ' chain family , is found to be @xmath16 times less abundant than hc@xmath10n @xcite .",
    "so far , this similarity between polyynes and carbon chains , could not be further explored as no other member of the hc@xmath1n was observed in space . in this letter , we report the detection in irc+10216 of the next member of this family , hc@xmath0n , and show that the hccn / hc@xmath0n abundance ratio is 20 times smaller than the hc@xmath10n / hccn ratio .",
    "contrary to cyanopolyynes which are linear and have @xmath17 electronic ground states , the lowest energy form of hccn is a quasi - linear triplet ( saito et al .",
    "1984 , rice and schaeffer 1987 ) .",
    "similarly , ab initio calculations @xcite predict that one of the 3 low - energy isomers of hc@xmath0n is a linear triplet with a @xmath7 ground state ( hereafter hc@xmath0n , see fig .",
    "1 ) , the other two being a c@xmath10-ring ( c@xmath10-hc@xmath0n ) and a bent carbene structure ( b - hc@xmath0n ) .",
    "the 3 isomers have been recently observed in the laboratory @xcite ; their microwave spectra are now fully characterized , opening the way to unambiguous identification in astronomical sources .",
    "the astronomical observations were carried out between 1995 and 2003 using the 30-m iram radiotelescope at pico veleta , sierra nevada ( spain ) .",
    "most of the data were taken during a sensitive 3-mm wavelength ( 80 - 115 ghz ) line survey of irc+10216 , which has an r.m.s .",
    "noise of few mk per 1 mhz - wide channel .",
    "these data were complemented in august 2003 with more sensitive observations at the frequencies of sinc @xcite .",
    "we detected a number of u - lines , 9 of which could be grouped into 3 close triplets with similar line intensities .",
    "the center frequencies of the triplets were harmonically related , implying a common linear carrier with a rotation constant @xmath18 mhz .",
    "the rotation constant suggested a molecule similar to c@xmath19h ( @xmath20 mhz ) and the triplet structure an even number of electrons .",
    "this pointed out to hc@xmath0n , and we could quickly check that the frequencies of our 9 u - lines agreed with those predicted from the spectroscopic constants of @xcite . that hc@xmath0n was the carrier of our new lines",
    "was definitely confirmed when we succeeded in detecting a fourth line triplet ( see fig .",
    "2e and table 1 ) , during a dedicated search made in october 2003 .",
    "the observations were made in the wobbling mode , with the secondary nutating at a rate of 0.5 hz , in order to achieve very flat baselines ( see fig . 2 and below ) .",
    "only a zero - order baseline with an offset of @xmath21 mk , corresponding to the thermal dust emission of the circumstellar envelope , has been removed from the spectra .",
    "two sis 3-mm receivers , with orthogonal polarizations and system temperatures of @xmath22k , were used in parallel with two 1.3-mm receivers .",
    "the 3-mm data were co - added , so increasing the effective integration time and decreasing the r.m.s . noise . in the case of our best spectrum ( fig .",
    "2a ) , the effective integration time and noise temperature were equal to 52 h and 0.5 mk per 1-mhz wide channel , respectively .",
    "the temperature scale was calibrated with the help of two absorbers , respectively at room and liquid nitrogen temperature , using the atmosphere transparency model atm developed by @xcite currently installed in the 30-m telescope on - line calibration software ( see also pardo , cernicharo and serabyn 2001 ) . pointing and focus were regularly checked on planets and on the strong nearby quasar oj  287 . between the pointing sessions",
    ", we monitored the shapes of the strong lines that were observed in parallel with the 1.3-mm receivers .",
    "the cusped shapes and the line horn - to - center intensity ratios depend indeed critically on the accuracy of the telescope pointing and focus . thanks to these precautions , the intensities of the lines observed several times in the 1995 - 2003 period were found constant within 10% .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectra covering the 4 triplets , which correspond to 4 successive rotational transitions of hc@xmath0n ( from n=@xmath23 to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the spectrum centered at 82.9 ghz , which was observed while searching for sicn @xcite , sinc @xcite and hccn , is shown twice in this figure : full scale , i.e. from 82650 mhz to 83150 mhz ( fig .",
    "2a ) and half - scale , around the hc@xmath0n n=18@xmath1217 triplet ( fig .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise in this 1 mhz resolution spectrum is only 0.5 mk , which makes it one of the the most sensitive spectra ever obtained with the 30-m telescope .",
    "forty spectral lines are detected in fig .",
    "most are weak and partly blended .",
    "the blended lines are easily resolved , thanks to their characteristic cusps , sharp edges and constant width in velocity ( this shape results from the uniform expansion of the outer circumstellar envelope ) .",
    "we can identify almost 60% of these lines with the help of the molecular line catalog maintained by one of us ( jc ) and described in @xcite .",
    "the catalog contains the mm transitions of some 1200 different molecular species . of the remaining 40% unidentified lines ,",
    "at least half could be tentatively assigned to some heavy species ( see below ) .",
    "the carriers of the unambiguously identified lines are mostly @xmath2c and @xmath25c isotopomers of long carbon chain molecules ( c@xmath0h , c@xmath26h , c@xmath27h , h@xmath4c@xmath10 , h@xmath4c@xmath0 , and hc@xmath19n ) , as well as silicon compounds , such as sic@xmath0 , sicn , and sinc .",
    "for the first time , we detect a doubly - substituted @xmath25c isotopomer of cyanoacetylene : h@xmath25c@xmath25ccn ( see fig2e , 96623 mhz ; several lines of the three doubly - substituted @xmath25c isotopomers of hc@xmath10n have been detected in our 3 mm line survey of irc+10216 ) .",
    "the number of unidentified lines at the 3 mk level detected in the 4 frequency bands is @xmath2815 lines / ghz .",
    "several of these lines probably arise from vibrationally excited c@xmath19h and c@xmath29h and their @xmath25c isotopomers , species for which we have no accurate laboratory frequencies ( for example , u82924 and/or u82938 and u82995 could well correspond to the @xmath30 lines of @xmath31 ccccc@xmath25ch ; u82677 , u82737 , u92034 and u92045 could correspond to different @xmath32 and @xmath33 vibronic states of the lowest energy bending mode of c@xmath29h ) .",
    "others probably come from @xmath25c and @xmath34si isotopomers of of sic@xmath0 ( for example the j=29 - 28 and j=32 - 31 lines of @xmath34sic@xmath0 at 87588 and 96648 mhz respectively and the j=27 - 26 line of sic@xmath25ccc at 82704 mhz ) . finally , some unidentified lines are close to transition frequencies predicted for sic@xmath19 ( u82746 , u82876 and u82995 ) , c@xmath19s ( u83038 ) and kcn ( for which we have detected several additional lines that will be published elsewhere ) , and c@xmath35h ( u83011 ) . obviously , the u - line density is too high at present to claim the detection of any of these species , which all have a rich mm spectrum , on the basis of just one , two , or even three weak lines .",
    "the hc@xmath0n lines shown in fig .",
    "2 are cusped ( see in particular fig . 2a , where the lines have the highest signal - to - noise ratio ) .",
    "this implies that this molecule is mostly confined into the outer part of the circumstellar envelope , presumably in the 15\"-radius hollow shell where mos t of the free radicals and carbon chains are found @xcite . from the intensities of the four triplets we derive a rotational temperature of 25@xmath364 k , close to that derived for hc@xmath10n .",
    "the permanent dipole moment of hc@xmath0n has been calculated by @xcite to be 4.3 d. using this value and assuming thermal equilibrium at 25 k , we derive a column density for hc@xmath0n of 1.5 10@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we have re - calculated the rotation temperature and the abundance of hccn by adding to the 2-mm lines reported by @xcite the lines observed in our new 3-mm survey .",
    "we find a rotational temperature of 15@xmath362 k , slightly higher than our previous estimate ( 12@xmath362 k ) .",
    "the hccn lines are also cusped and the hccn column density , assuming a dipole moment of 3 d @xcite , is 1.4 10@xmath25 @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the increase in rotation temperature between hccn and hc@xmath0n is not surprising as a similar increase is observed between the cyanopolyynes hc@xmath10n and hc@xmath19n .",
    "the hccn / hc@xmath0n abundance ratio is found equal to 9 .",
    "this is about twice the decrement observed between the successive members of the cyanopolyynes family , hc@xmath10n / hc@xmath19n , but @xmath37 times less than the hc@xmath10n / hccn ( @xmath16 ) and hc@xmath19n / hc@xmath0n ( 400 ) abundance ratios , which confirms that , like the carbon chain radicals , the even and odd hc@xmath13n families have parallel , but distinct formation paths .",
    "we have also searched in our 3 mm line survey for the linear triplet hc@xmath29n , but without success .",
    "the 3@xmath9 upper limit to the column density of this species , assuming a rotation temperature of 25 k , is 1 10@xmath25 @xmath3 , not low enough to constrain significantly the hc@xmath0n / hc@xmath29n ratio , but already 25 times lower than the hc@xmath26n column density @xcite .    as noted above , the carbon chain molecules c@xmath5n and hc@xmath5n are thought to be formed in irc+10216 from the reaction of radicals such as cch and cn with carbon - chain molecules or radicals @xcite .",
    "similarly , we could consider that hc@xmath0n may form through the reaction of c@xmath10n and c@xmath10h with hcn and ch@xmath4 , e.g. , c@xmath10h + hcn @xmath12 hc@xmath0n + h , or may be c@xmath10n + ch@xmath38hc@xmath0n + h. all the reactants are relatively abundant in the outer layers of the circumstellar envelope and we expect , by analogy with similar reactions studied in the laboratory , that at least one of these reactions could proceed rapidly .",
    "another path proposed for the formation of cyanopolyynes involves ion - molecule reactions yielding h@xmath10c@xmath13n@xmath39 or h@xmath4c@xmath13n@xmath39 , followed by the dissociative recombination of these ions @xcite .",
    "the low abundance of ions in irc+10216 makes this path relatively slow @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of hccn and hc@xmath0n , the reaction of hcn with ch@xmath40 , leading to h@xmath4c@xmath4n@xmath39 + h@xmath4 ( or h@xmath10c@xmath4n@xmath39 + h ) , does not proceed @xcite , making the ion - molecule path even slower and less likely than in the case of cyanopolyynes .    finally , a last process , formation on dust grains followed by photodesorption when the grains reach the outer envelope layers , has been advocated in the case of irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism may well produce hccn , hc@xmath0n , and the cyanopolyynes observed in the outer shell , but would provide no simple explanation to why the abundance decrement within each family seems to be so constant .",
    "the hc@xmath0n lines detected during this study belong to the linear triplet isomer .",
    "we have unsuccessfully searched for the singlet bent hc@xmath0n isomer and for the c@xmath10-ring cyclic isomer .",
    "those latter have a permanent dipole moment almost as large as the linear isomer : 2.96d ( @xmath41=2.9@xmath42d , @xmath43=0.5@xmath42d ) and 3.48@xmath42d ( @xmath41=3.15@xmath42d , @xmath43=1.49@xmath42d ) , respectively , versus 4.3 d for linear hc@xmath0n @xcite .",
    "the upper limits to the column density of these species are @xmath28 3 10@xmath2 @xmath3 , assuming the same rotational temperature than for linear triplet hc@xmath0n ( 25 k ) .",
    "the most accurate calculations of the hc@xmath0n structure to date ( level ccsd(t)/cc - pcvtz ) predict that the singlet ring isomer of hc@xmath0n lies 4.2 kcal / mol below the linear triplet isomer @xcite .",
    "if this result is confirmed , the non - detection of the ringed isomer ( and of the bent isomer ) would further stress the discrimination against ringed structures already noted in the case of carbon chain radicals .",
