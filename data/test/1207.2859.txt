    "kuzmin @xcite ( gzk ) cutoff , together with the global isotropy of the arrival directions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and the fact that the uhe particles are not expected to be confined by the milky - way magnetic field ( see e.g.  @xcite ) suggest that the bulk of cosmic rays at these energies have extragalactic origin .",

    "the latter fact gets further , though limited by statistical significance , support from the shape of the gzk feature in the spectrum which does not seem to be very sharp ( cf.ref .",

    "a number of simple estimates rule out many classes of potential sources .",
    "these simple criteria include in particular the geometrical ( hillas ) criterion @xcite and estimates of radiative energy losses of particles being accelerated ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "analysis of the modern astrophysical data demonstrates @xcite that the combination of these constraints leaves just a few candidate classes of sources capable of acceleration of particles to uhe energies .",
    "leaving aside large - scale structures where interaction losses are expected to suppress the energy gain , the conventional diffusive ( e.g. , relativistic or non - relativistic shock ) acceleration may work only in ultrarelativistic jets , hot spots and lobes of exceptional active galaxies ( powerful radio galaxies and blazars ) which are not that abundant in the nearby universe .",
    "for very special field configurations when synchrotron losses are suppressed and the curvature radiation dominates , possible acceleration sites include also gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and immediate neighbourhood of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the galactic nuclei . while it is unclear whether these field configurations may be present in grbs , recent icecube results disfavour the grb scenario anyway @xcite ( see however ref .",

    "the model assumes that :    * cosmic - ray particles are accelerated by the regular electric field within a few @xmath168 from the smbh  @xcite ; the field configuration is given by the solutions of refs .",
    "@xcite and is fully determined by the smbh mass @xmath8 , its angular momentum @xmath25 and the magnetic - field normalization @xmath11 ; * all cosmic - ray particles accelerated near a given smbh have similar initial conditions and therefore all are accelerated up to one and the same energy limited by the curvature - radiation losses ; this maximal energy is calculated in the model and depends on @xmath8 only ( provided @xmath11 is a given , model - dependent , function of @xmath8 ; dependence from @xmath25 smooths this monochromatic spectrum insignificantly ) ; * the _ mean _ flux of a source ( which accounts for the fraction of the sources where this mechanism does work ) depends from @xmath8 in a power - like manner ; the normalization and the exponent are two free parameters of the model ( the best fit to the cosmic - ray spectrum indicates that this dependence is weak ) ; * the concentration of sources is determined by the redshift - dependent smbh mass function taken from astrophysical literature .    within these assumptions and given the @xmath169 relation",
    "is fixed ( we considered three popular choices for it ) , the model has two free parameters which we find by fitting the cosmic - ray spectrum at the earth to the experimental data . with parameters fixed in this way , we subject the model to several further tests which it passes succesfully :    1 .",
    "the concentration of sources is large enough to satisfy the constraints from absence of clustering in uhecr arrival directions ; 2 .",
    "the luminosity of a particular source , determined by the flux normalization and concentration , is not too high ; 3 .",
    "secondary gamma rays from distant sources do not overshy the measured gev diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "given the success of the toy model , it is interesting to discuss its possible refinements .",
    "the assumptions we have made within the model are quite robust and realistic .",
    "one subtle point is related to the value of the smbh angular momentum @xmath25 which may vary from one black hole to another .",
    "however , these variations are probably modest given the scaling relation between the mass and the angular momentum of cosmic black holes proposed in ref .",
    "the precision of predictions may be improved with more realistic modelling of the acceleration mechanism , in particular , with account of the charge concentration at the smbh and in the acceleration region , of the finite thickness of the accretion disk etc .",
    "ultimately , this approach might give answer to the question , which particular smbhs are strong sources and which are not , thus determining the ( presently free ) parameter theoretically .",
    "however , this is a complicated task and is far beyond the scope of the present work .    one possible question concerns the low - energy part of the spectrum where , as is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ f_specaugergamma ] , the contribution of the mechanism we discuss is insufficient to explain the observed spectrum due to the depletion of the smbh mass function at low masses .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this depletion is compensated by a huge contribution of the smbh in our own galaxy which , indeed , has the appropriate mass .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this proposal requires , however , a much more precise study of physical properties and possibilities for particle acceleration close to the galactic center .",
