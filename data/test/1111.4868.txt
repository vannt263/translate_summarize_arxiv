    "providing an unambiguous proof of the cosmic - ray origin until now has been elusive , despite many decades of attempts and controversial claims ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "cosmic - rays are mainly protons and heavy ions ( hadrons ) and , in a few percent , electrons and positrons .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are ideal candidates for the cosmic - ray production up to energies near @xmath1 = @xmath2  ev . the snr energy output in the galaxy can indeed supply the energy budget necessary to maintain the present population of cosmic - rays . furthermore the observations of ultra - relativistic electrons support the hypothesis that also protons are accelerated in these objects ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "proving the fact that the snr origin of hadronic cosmic - rays is difficult because of the complexity of the snr - environment interaction . from an observational point of view , a direct proof can be given by an unambiguous detection of the gamma - ray emission expected from neutral pion decay in hadronic interactions .",
    "however radiation from co - spatially accelerated electrons can mask and sometimes overcome the expected neutral pion decay signature of proton / ion emission in the 100  mev - a few  tev energy range .",
    "recent analysis suggests that several gamma - ray observations of snrs can be understood in terms of accelerated hadrons @xcite .",
    "however it is currently not possible to exclude that the observed @xmath3-ray emission is produced by leptons alone .",
    "the discrepancies between leptonic and hadronic models are expected to be more evident at low energies ( 50 - 100  mev ) .",
    "gamma - ray astronomy in this energy band is very challenging because of high background - noise flux and of the strong multiple scattering suffered by electrons originating from @xmath3-ray events .",
    "the agile / grid instrument ( calibrated in the 50  mev - 10  gev band ) , however , has already shown its ability to provide an energy spectrum starting at 50  mev for bright objects @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on a low - energy @xmath3-ray and multiwavelength spectrum for the snr w44 in order to constraint the emitting particle spectrum and discriminate between leptonic and hadronic models .",
    "snr w44 is a well studied middle - aged snr located in the galactic disk at a distance of @xmath4  kpc from earth @xcite .",
    "w44 is an ideal system to test the presence of accelerated hadrons and the interplay between hadronic and leptonic models .",
    "radio ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and x - ray @xcite mapping of the snr show a roughly elliptical shocked shell and a centrally peaked emission respectively . in the ir band @xcite it is evident that the shell is expanding into a dense surrounding medium ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite discovered the radio pulsar psr  b1853 + 01 with distance and age compatible with the snr .",
    "@xcite and then @xcite found a massive molecular cloud interacting with the south - eastern side of the remnant .",
    "evidence for a more complex system of massive mcs and for their interactions with the remnant , shown by some features typical of a strong shock , was given by @xcite and then by @xcite .",
    "the mc - snr interactions were confirmed by the maser oh ( 1720  mhz ) emission reported by @xcite and then by @xcite .",
    "+ the first estimation of the spectral radio index variations as a function of position over the remnant was done by @xcite : the eastern limb spectrum was consistent with a diffusive shock acceleration model and the spectrum flattening in the westernmost arc confirmed the mc - snr interaction observed in ir and optical band .",
    "+ gamma - ray emission from this snr has been detected by the fermi / lat instrument at energy e@xmath7200  mev @xcite , suggesting the presence of accelerated protons interacting with the surrounding medium .",
    "agile - grid data were analyzed using the agile standard analysis pipeline .",
    "we used @xmath3-ray events filtered by means of the @xmath8 agile filter pipeline ( as described in * ? ? ? * ) . in order to discriminate between background events and gamma rays ,",
    "the grid and anticoincidence system ( acs ) signals are processed , reconstructed and selected by a dedicated software @xcite .",
    "we used the most recent versions of the diffusion model @xcite and of the calibration files , available at the asdc site ( www.asdc.asi.it ) .",
    "we created counts , exposure and galactic background gamma - ray maps with a bin - size of @xmath9 x @xmath9 . in order to derive the source average flux and spectrum we ran the agile point source analysis software alike ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the maximum likelihood technique described in @xcite ) over the whole observing period 2007 july - 2011 april . both statistic and systematic uncertainties",
    "are taken into account .",
    "the spectrum was obtained by computing the @xmath3-ray flux in six energy bins selected with the aim to have a significance @xmath10 . in order to study the source morphology , we obtained an intensity map integrated over the energy range where the grid angular resolution is optimal ( e@xmath7400  mev ) .",
    "agile detects snr w44 with a significance of 15.8 @xmath11 as an extended source . figure  [ w44]a shows agile gamma - ray intensity map above 400  mev of the w44 region with the 324  mhz vla radio contours .",
    "the gamma - ray morphology remarkably resembles the quasi - elliptical pattern of the interior of the radio shell , especially coinciding with the radio brightness enhancements toward the north - west and south - east regions .",
    "both the radio pulsar psr b1803 + 01 position @xcite and its ( small ) pulsar wind nebula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are inconsistent with the gamma - ray morphology detected by agile .",
    "moreover , @xcite excluded the presence of a pulsation in the @xmath3-ray signal .",
    "figure  [ w44]b shows the co emission at a kinematic velocity compatible with the distance of w44 , tracing the presence of mcs in the w44 surroundings , together with the gamma - ray contour levels .",
    "it can be inferred that the south - eastern side of the @xmath3-ray source overlaps with the mc - snr interaction region . in the northern part of the shell , the @xmath3-ray and co emissions",
    "are not correlated , however many studies of the surrounding interstellar medium showed the presence of dense gas not traced by co @xcite .",
    "figure  [ w44]c displays an sii map overlaid with x - ray and gamma - ray contours .",
    "the strong sulfur [ sii ] emission , along with h@xmath12 emission , indicates the presence of shocked gas @xcite .",
    "figure  [ w44_spec ] shows the agile w44 photon energy spectrum for the whole range 50  mev- 10  gev .",
    "the measured flux above 400  mev is @xmath13  photons  @xmath14  s@xmath15 . in this figure",
    "are also shown fermi / lat spectral points @xcite over an energy range 0.2 - 30  gev . in the band where the spectra overlap , the sets of data are compatible at 1@xmath11 . in this regard",
    "it is important to stress how agile is able to detect the emission from w44 in the energy range 50  mev-300  mev extending the spectrum to energies substantially lower than those previously obtained .",
    "this spectrum shows a clear decrement at photon energies lower than 400  mev , confirming the expectations based on neutral pion emission from accelerated protons / ions : a peak energy near 1  gev for hadron energy spectra flatter than @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum becomes steep at higher energies with a photon power - law index @xmath170.1 , in agreement with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "leptonic - only models of gamma - ray production have to satisfy the very well determined spatial and spectral constraints provided by the radio , optical , and gamma - ray emissions .",
    "for both the bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cases we tested the class of leptonic - only models attempting to reproduce the observed gamma - ray spectrum for different input leptonic spectra ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we used a phenomenological approach based on two evidences : a ) the synchrotron spectrum implies that the radio electron distribution is well described by a power - law over a wide range of energies , b ) the discontinuity in the slope of the gamma - rays spectrum implies a discontinuity in the emitting particle spectrum .",
    "we assumed three electron distributions that can , in principle , describe this behavior : 1 ) a power - law with a high energy cut - off , @xmath18 , ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2 ) a power - law with a low energy cut - off , @xmath19 , ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 3 ) a broken power - law , @xmath20 , ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath21 is the cut - off energy and @xmath22 is the normalization constant .",
    "+ since the distributions with a cut - off ( 1 and 2 ) fail to reproduce simultaneously both the radio and @xmath3-ray spectrum , we refer to the distribution ( 3 ) .",
    "the best fit to the gamma - ray data is obtained with @xmath23  gev , and indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 above and below @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "synchrotron emission originating from this distribution can be evaluated for different values of the average magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ spec3 ] shows the case of the most `` favorable '' leptonic - only model characterized by @xmath27  @xmath28 g ( other cases turn out to be even less favorable ) .",
    "we find that , at high frequencies , the calculated synchrotron spectrum is in strong disagreement ( factor larger than 4 ) with the radio emission produced co - spatially to the gamma - ray one ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure  [ w44 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the inferred average density , _ _ n__= 300  @xmath6 , is too large ( by a factor of three ) compared with the circumstellar medium constraints @xcite ; a lower value for @xmath29 would be incompatible with the gamma - ray spectrum fitting . similar or",
    "even stronger contradictions with the multiwavelength data apply to other leptonic - only models that we systematically explored for a large variety of parameters .",
    "+ in the case of inverse compton dominated models , two sources of soft photons are available : the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) and the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) . in the first case , a second peak in the gamma - ray spectrum",
    "is unavoidably expected with a peak energy @xmath30 1 tev , in contradiction with the upper - limits obtained from tev cherenkov telescopes . in the case of interaction with isrf , instead , the calculated synchrotron peak is not compatible with the radio continuum data for any reasonable value of the magnetic field in the snr shell .",
    "we can then reliably exclude leptonic - only models of emission for snr  w44 .",
    "it is interesting to determine the main physical parameters of an emission model dominated by hadrons in the gamma - ray energy range .",
    "the gamma - ray emission was derived assuming that protons interact with the nuclei of the ambient medium through pp interactions and then radiate through @xmath31 decay @xcite . in order to fit the gamma - ray spectrum we tested , as proton energy distribution , a power law , a broken power law and a power law with cut - offs .",
    "the distribution providing the best - fit of the gamma - ray spectrum turned out to be a power - law with a relatively steep spectral index and a low - energy cut - off , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34  gev .",
    "the inferred total energy of hadrons producing the observed gamma - ray spectrum is @xmath35  erg ( depending on the average magnetic field and local densities , see table 1 ) corresponding to a fraction of the total snr shell kinetic energy @xmath36 .",
    "this value is a lower limit on the total energy of hadrons accelerated by w44 during its entire life , because the most energetic hadrons , likely accelerated during the early epochs of the snr life , can escape from the acceleration site on timescales shorter than the age of this snr @xcite .",
    "electrons produce the radio continuum and shell - like features by synchrotron emission in an average magnetic field in the range @xmath37  @xmath28 g .",
    "they also produce bremsstrahlung and inverse compton components that are subdominant in the gamma - ray energy range for a standard value of the electron / proton number ratio @xmath38 .",
    "our best `` hadronic model '' is shown in figure  [ spec2 ] .",
    "we note that the spectral index found in this analysis is quite steep in comparison with the expectations for the spectrum of particles accelerated in snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the cosmic - ray spectrum can be altered ( softened ) by the interaction with sites where the target gas is confined , for example by molecular clouds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the total number of accelerated hadrons in w44 is consistent with an efficiency of a few percent in the conversion of snr kinetic energy into cosmic - ray energy .    within the hadronic scenario ,",
    "the broad - band spectrum is successfully modeled by the gamma - ray emission resulting from the decay of neutral pions produced by accelerated protons / ions with a spectral index near 3 and a cut - off energy @xmath40  gev ( figures  [ w44_spec ] and [ spec2 ] ) .",
    "electrons ( a few percent in number ) contribute to the synchrotron radio emission and to a weak bremsstrahlung component .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spectral cut - off energy @xmath26 and the steep power - law index may indicate either a `` diffusion '' effect of high - energy hadrons , or a suppression of efficient particle acceleration in dense environments @xcite as expected in w44 .",
    "our results on w44 are complementary with those obtained in other snrs , most notably ic  443 @xcite and w28 @xcite .",
