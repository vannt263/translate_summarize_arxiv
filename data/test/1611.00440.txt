    "they counted the sentiment value for obama and mccain based on number of the positive and negative words stated on each tweet .",
    "the tweets were gathered during 2008 - 2009 , whereas the positive and negative words were acquired from _",
    "opinionfinder_. they found that the comparison between sentiment on tweets and polls were complex since people might choose `` obama '' , `` mccain '' , `` have not decided '' , `` not going to vote '' , or any independent candidate on the polls .",

    "lang_. we only use the contents of _ created_at _ and _ text _ attributes since this research focuses on the sentiment toward the candidates in a particular time , not including the geographic location and other information .",
    "the collected tweets are mainly written in english .",
    "we publish the raw and preprocessed tweets upon request for future use .",
    "the data are available for research use by email .",
    "we preprocess the data by : ( 1 ) removing urls and pictures , also ( 2 ) by filtering tweets which have candidates name .",
    "_ hashtags _ , _ mentions _ , and _ retweets _ are not removed in order to maintain the original meaning of a tweet .",
    "we only save tweets which have passed the two requirements such as in table 1 .",

    "the second example shows a removed tweet , which does nt contain any candidates name .",

    ".tweets example on preprocessing stage [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     our model prediction ranks from 1 to 9 and it differs from the poll s ( rank 1 to 8) . before we do the comparison , we adjust the prediction ranks in order to make an equal range .",
    "we move jeb bush , ben carson , chris christie , and donald trump , who are formerly on the 9th rank , to the 8th rank .",
    "we compare the prediction ranks with the poll and calculate the error rate .",

    "our model performs better on predicting republican candidates , which achieves 1.67 error of 7 remaining candidates ( see table iv and v )",
    ".    overall prediction accuracy can be calculated by subtracting one with the average result of error rate division on each party by number of its remaining candidates .",
    "we achieve 0.548 prediction accuracy , which is not good enough@xcite .",
    "the model accuracy is mainly affected by the large error rate on democratic candidates ( 1.33 from 2 candidates ) .",
    "using simple preprocessed data , our naive bayesian model successfully achieves 95.8% accuracy on _ 10-fold cross validation _ and gets 54.8% accuracy on predicting the poll result .",
    "the model predicts ted cruz and bernie sanders as the nominee of republican and democratic party respectively .",
    "based on the positive predictions , it predicts that bernie sanders will be elected as the 2016 u.s .",
    "president .",
    "although it has 95.8% accuracy during the model test , the model s prediction does not represent the poll .",
    "table iii shows that model s accuracy is not dependent of its number of training data .",
    "model with less training data ( e.g. mike huckabee s ) can perform perfectly during the model test and only misses a rank on the prediction , whereas model with more training data ( e.g. donald trump s ) can have worse performance . to see how the model accuracy is affected by number of training data , we train more models for each candidate using _",
    "n _ first tweets and use them to predict the next 4000 tweets sentiment ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "bernie sanders and donald trump s models have the most consistent accuracy on predicting the sentiment .",
    "models with less training data ( e.g. martin omalley , jim gilmore , mike huckabee ) tend to have fluctuating accuracy .",
    "the models which are trained using 1,000 first tweets have 55.85% of average accuracy and 26.49% of standard deviation , whereas the models which are trained using 33,000 first tweets have slightly different accuracy : 65.75% of average accuracy and 27.79% of standard deviation .",
    "this shows that the number of training data does not affect the overall model accuracy .",
    "our model might not represent the poll , but the election is still ongoing and we do not know which candidate will become the next u.s .",
    "hence , there is possibility that the predicted nominees become the next u.s .",
    "otherwise , twitter might not be used to predict the actual polls @xcite .",
    "we built naive bayesian predictive models for 2016 u.s . presidential election .",
    "we use the official hashtag and simple preprocessing method to prepare the data without modifying its meaning .",
    "our model achieves 95.8% accuracy during the model test and predicts the poll with 54.8% accuracy .",
