    "hydrogen peroxide ( h@xmath0o@xmath0 ) is a well - studied system because of its unusual properties , particularly the almost freely rotating oh moieties .",
    "the role of h@xmath0o@xmath0  in the chemistry of the earth s atmosphere @xcite as well as of the martian atmosphere @xcite has been widely acknowledged .",
    "it has also recently been detected in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the vibration - rotation spectra of hydrogen peroxide has attracted significant attention , both experimental and theoretical .",
    "for example it has been used as a benchmark system with large amplitude motion for testing different variational nuclear motion codes @xcite .",
    "very recently mayszek and koput @xcite presented a highly accurate _",
    "ab initio_potential energy surface ( pes ) of hooh which was shown to reproduce the known vibrational band origins with the average accuracy of 1 @xmath2 .",

    "hydrogen peroxide has three important properties from the viewpoint of variational calculations .",
    "firstly , the large amplitude motion of the oh internal rotors that has already been mentioned . secondly , its relatively low dissociation energy of about 17,000 @xmath2has made h@xmath0o@xmath0  a benchmark tetratomic molecule for experimental study of the dissociation process @xcite .",
    "thirdly , h@xmath0o@xmath0   is a tetratomic system where variational calculations can really aid the analysis of spectra .    for triatomic molecules , accurate calculation of the rotation - vibration levels to high accuracy using variational nuclear motion methods",
    "has become routine @xcite .",
    "for tetratomic molecules this process is just beginning ; it is natural for initial high accuracy studies to focus on molecules with large amplitude motion such as ammonia @xcite and hydrogen peroxide .    the advantages of using variational calculations to assign vibration - rotation spectra of triatomic molecules has been demonstrated for several molecules .",
    "initial studies focused on h@xmath7  @xcite and water @xcite , systems for which the use of variational calculations to analyse spectra is now the accepted procedure . in particular , spectra involving hot molecules , and hence high rotational states , and large amplitude motion , such as h@xmath7  on jupiter @xcite and water on the sun @xcite , assignments using the traditional , effective hamiltonian approach are almost impossible .",
    "a significant advantage of variational calculations over effective hamiltonian techniques is the automatic allowance for accidental resonances between vibrations . whereas for most triatomic molecules",
    "such resonances become significant at fairly high vibrational energies , for tetratomic molecules accidental resonances can even make the analysis of low - lying vibrational states intractable using effective hamiltonians .",
    "h@xmath0o@xmath0  is a good example of this situation . although h@xmath0o@xmath0  spectral lines are strong and were first observed more than seventy years ago with spectrometers much less sophisticated then those available nowadays @xcite , the analysis of experimental spectra involving high @xmath1 transitions for h@xmath0o@xmath0  is only complete up to 2000 @xmath2  @xcite , significantly lower in frequency than transitions to the oh stretching fundamentals .",
    "one reason for this is the complication of the analysis by accidental resonances .",
    "accurate variational calculations on h@xmath0o@xmath0  offer a way out of this impasse .",
    "recent advances in variational calculations suggest that they can be used for systems larger than triatomic .",
    "high accuracy variational calculations of the spectra and line lists for tetratomic molecules such as ammonia @xcite have been performed .",
    "these nh@xmath8 line lists have been used both for the assignment of transitions involving higher vibrational states @xcite , hot rovibrational spectra involving high @xmath1 levels @xcite as well as for correcting and improving the analysis of more standard transitions @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations of wavefunctions for high @xmath1 states of tetratomic molecules are possible not only because modern computers have the ability to diagonalise larger matrices but also because , as illustrated below , the accuracy of calculations employing approximate kinetic energy operators @xcite becomes comparable with those using an exact kinetic energy approach @xcite . while high @xmath1 calculations within the exact kinetic energy approach are still computationally challenging for tetratomic molecules , calculations with @xmath9",
    "are feasible with approaches such as trove @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of calculating",
    "_ ab initio_dipole moment surfaces of extremely high accuracy @xcite enhances the value of using variational calculations since they can also be used to create line lists .",
    "these factors raise the possibility of creating accurate line lists for h@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "however , the presence of the large amplitude , torsional motion of the two oh fragments in h@xmath0o@xmath0  complicates the problem .",
    "this requires an appropriate nuclear motion programme for calculation of the rovibrational energy levels by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation ; this programme should be able to compute high @xmath1 levels within the limitations of the modern computers .    in this paper",
    "we compute high accuracy rovibrational energy levels going to high @xmath1 for h@xmath0o@xmath0   using the _ ab initio _",
    "pes due to mayszek and koput @xcite . to do this we test two nuclear motion programmes : the exact kinetic energy ( eke ) programme wavr4 @xcite and approximate kinetic energy programme trove @xcite .",
    "it is shown that use of trove allows us to calculate very high @xmath1 energy levels which are in excellent agreement with observation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ s : method ] describes the modifications of the trove programme necessary to make it suitable for the calculation of spectra of such a nonrigid molecule .",
    "section  [ s : results ] describes the details of computations performed .",
    "section  [ s : concl ] presents our results which is followed by the concluding section which discusses prospects for further work on this system .",
    "the accuracy of a calculation of rovibrational energy levels depends first of all on the accuracy of the potential energy surface ( pes ) used as input to the nuclear motion schrdinger equation . until recently the most accurate pes for h@xmath0o@xmath0  was the one due to koput _",
    "@xcite which gave a typical discrepancy between theory and experiment for vibrational band origins of about 10 @xmath2  @xcite . however , two of us@xcite recently determined a very accurate pes computed using the explicitly correlated coupled - cluster method [ ccsd(t)-f12 ] method , @xcite in the f12b form @xcite as implemented in the molpro package @xcite .",
    "various correlation - consistent basis sets were used for various parts of the pes , the largest being aug - cc - pv7z .",
    "the ccsd(t)-f12 results were augmented with the born - oppenheimer diagonal , higher - order valence - electron correlation , relativistic , and core - electron correlation corrections . the 1762 _ ab initio _",
    "points obtained were fitted to the functional form @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the simons - parr - finlan stretching oo and oh coordinates @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the two ooh bending coordinates , @xmath18 is the torsional angle @xmath19hooh ( see fig .

    "f : tau ] ) , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the corresponding equilibrium values .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath23 used in this work are given in the supplementary material @xcite to this article ( see also ref . ) .",
    "recent calculations@xcite using this pes gave , for the 30 observed vibrational band origins of h@xmath0o@xmath0 , a standard deviation for the observed minus calculated ( obs @xmath4 calc ) wavenumbers of about 1 @xmath2 , an order of magnitude improvement over the previous results.@xcite an _ ab initio _",
    "line list with this accuracy could be useful for a number of applications .",
    "however , for most applications it is also necessary to accurately compute highly excited rotational levels .",
    "this is done in this work .",
    "before looking at high @xmath1 rotational levels , we reconsidered the @xmath24 results of mayszek and koput @xcite using both eke programme wavr4 @xcite and approximate kinetic energy programme trove @xcite .",
    "diatom - diatom ho  oh coordinates were employed in the programme wavr4 ; these coordinates were one of those used to consider acetylene ",
    "vinylidene isomerisation @xcite .",
    "the calculations used a discrete variable representations ( dvr ) based on a grid of 10 radial functions for each oh coordinate and 18 radial functions for the oo coordinate .",
    "the parameters used for oh stretch morse - oscillator like functions were @xmath25  , @xmath26 @xmath2  and @xmath27 @xmath2 , and @xmath28  , @xmath29 @xmath2  and @xmath30 @xmath2  for the oo stretch . the bending basis set consists of coupled angular functions @xcite defined by @xmath31 and @xmath32 = 12 .",
    "the resulting energy levels with @xmath1 = 0 were within 0.1 @xmath2  of the previous calculations @xcite , see table  [ tab : j1 ] .",
    "however for wavr4 calculations of the same accuracy for levels with @xmath33 require about 10 times more computer time .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath1  @xmath34 coupling used in the eke procedure .",
    "this coupling is essential for the linear hcch system @xcite and very floppy molecules @xcite , but not for h@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "the use of wavr4 to calculate energies of high @xmath1 levels is computationally unrealistic at present and we note that indeed corresponding studies on acetylene have thus far been confined to low @xmath1 values @xcite .",
    "trove is a computer suite for rovibrational calculations of energies and intensities for molecules of ( at least in principle ) arbitrary structures .",
    "trove uses a multilevel contraction scheme for constructing the rovibrational basis set .",
    "the primitive basis functions are given by products of six 1-dimensional ( 1d ) functions @xmath35 , where @xmath36 represents one of the six internal coordinates .",
    "for hooh we choose @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 to be the linearized versions of the three stretching internal displacements @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the linearized versions of the two bending displacements @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the torsional coordinate @xmath48 , see fig .",
    "[ f : tau ] .",
    "the kinetic energy operator in trove is given by an expansion in terms of the five coordinates @xmath49 , representing the rigid modes @xmath50 .",
    "the potential energy function is also expanded but using three morse - type expansion variables @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and two bending coordinates @xmath53 and @xmath54 . here @xmath55 @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath56 were selected to match closely the shape of the _ ab initio_pes along the stretching modes . in the present work",
    "we employ 6th and 8th order expansions to represent , respectively , the kinetic energy operator and potential energy function .",
    "the rovibrational motion of the non - rigid molecule hooh is best represented by the extended @xmath58(m ) molecular symmetry group @xcite , which is isomorphic to @xmath59(m ) as well as to the extended group @xmath60(em).@xcite as explained in detail by bunker and jensen@xcite , the extended group is needed to describe the torsional splitting due both the _ cis_- and _ trans_-tunnelings . in the present work we use the @xmath59(m ) group to classify the symmetry of the hooh states .",
    "this group is given by the eight irreducible representations @xmath61 . in order to account for the extended symmetry properties of the floppy hooh molecules",
    "an extended range for torsion motion , from 0@xmath62 to 720@xmath63 was introduced into trove . in this representation @xmath64 and",
    "720@xmath63 correspond to the _ cis _ barrier , while at @xmath65 the molecule has the _ trans _ configuration .",
    "trove s primitive basis functions , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , are generated numerically by solving six 1d vibrational schrdinger equations for each vibrational mode @xmath68 employing the numerov - cooley method  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding reduced 1d hamiltonian operators @xmath69 ( @xmath67 ) are obtained by freezing the five remaining modes at the corresponding equilibriums .",
    "the integration ranges are selected to be large enough to accommodate all basis functions required ( see below for the discussion of the basis set sizes ) .",
    "the torsional functions are obtained initially on the range @xmath70 and transform according with the @xmath71(m ) group .",
    "a very fine grid of 30,000 points and the quadruple numerical precision [ real(16 ) ] was used for generating the eigenfunctions of the corresponding schrdinger equation in order to resolve the @xmath72 splittings up to @xmath73 .",
    "the wavefunctions are then extended to @xmath74 through the @xmath75 reflection of the @xmath71(m ) values and classified according to @xmath59(m ) .",
    "the extended primitive torsion functions are able to account for the torsional splitting due to both the _ cis _ and _ trans _ tunneling .",
    "the 6d primitive basis functions are then formed from different products of the 1d functions @xmath66 .",
    "the size of the basis set is controlled in trove by the so - called polyad number @xmath76 , which in the present case is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath67 are the local mode quantum numbers corresponding to the primitive functions @xmath79 . the primitive basis set is then processed through a number of contractions , as described in detail previously @xcite , to give a final basis set in the @xmath24 representation .",
    "= 7.0 cm    calculations using programme trove started with a search for a basis set and operator expansions which would give results close to the eke ones .",
    "the final values of the basis set parameters were chosen to try to meet two conflicting requirements : the best possible convergence and a compact enough calculation to allow high @xmath1 energy levels to be computed .",
    "the final basis set parameters were the following : the maximum polyad number @xmath80 , which also corresponds to the highest excitation of the torsional mode @xmath81 .",
    "for o - o stretch the maximal number was 8 , for oh stretches - 8 and for the bending modes - 10 .",
    "these parameters control the size of the basis set used in the trove calculations according with eq .",
    "( [ e : polyad ] ) . for the @xmath24 levels they give good agreement with the previous studies , see table  [ tab : j0 ] .",
    "the updated version of trove was used to calculate excited rotational levels for @xmath1 up to 35 , the highest assigned thus far experimentally .",
    "initial calculations were performed with the equilibrium distances and angles obtained _ ab initio _  in ref . .",
    "in this case the discrepancies between theory and experiment increased quadratically with increasing @xmath1 : the @xmath33 levels were calculated with an accuracy around 0.001 @xmath2 , but those for @xmath6 differ from experiment by about 1 @xmath2 .",
    "we therefore chose to adjust the equilibrium parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 to better reproduce the experimental values .",
    "only very small changes were needed to make the @xmath6 levels accurate to about 0.03 @xmath2  for the ground vibrational state .",
    "in particular , the original value of @xmath20 of 1.45539378   was shifted to 1.45577728   and @xmath82   moved to 0.96253006  .",
    "the rotational structure within the excited vibrational states is of similar accuracy , meaning that these levels are essentially shifted just by the discrepancy in the vibrational band origin . in practice",
    "this geometry shift not only meant that low @xmath1 energy levels were reproduced with an accuracy of 1 @xmath2 , reproducing the accuracy of the vibrational band origin , but also resulted in pseudo - resonance artifacts . to illustrate this consider the interaction between the ground vibrational state and the low - lying @xmath83 torsional vibrational state , which lies about 2 @xmath2  too low in the calculations .",
    "this results is an artificial closeness , and interaction , between levels with the same @xmath1 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting shift in the energy levels is significant ; it grows with @xmath1 and reaches about 1 @xmath2  at @xmath1 = 30 .",
    "we call this a pseudo - resonance artifact since no such interaction is seen in the experimentally - determined energy levels .",
    "there are several ways to avoid this artificial pseudo - resonances .",
    "one would be to fit the pes to experimental data , which would remove this artificial near - degeneracy .",
    "this is likely to be a topic of future work .",
    "an alternative possibility , which is already available within trove @xcite , is to simply adjust the calculated values of the vibrational band origins given by the @xmath3 calculation to the observed ones prior to their use in calculations of the @xmath87 levels .",
    "this option , which is not available in eke codes which couple the bending basis with the rotational functions @xcite , not only shifts the energies , it also rearranges the matrix elements so that the artificial resonances disappear . with this adjusted calculation",
    "the energy levels vary smoothly with the increasing @xmath1 and @xmath88 quantum numbers , see tables [ tab : j1 ] , [ tab : j30 ] and [ tab : j35 ] , as one would expect @xcite from purely _ ab initio _  levels .",
    "one other problem remained when comparing our rotationally excited energy levels with the observed ones .",
    "this concerned rotational levels with the quantum number @xmath89 which did not behave as levels associated with other values of @xmath88 .",
    "the error for the two levels with @xmath89 increases disproportionately to that of other levels as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this error was about 0.1 @xmath2  for @xmath1 = 30 .",
    "a series of test calculations revealed the reason for such discrepant behaviour of the levels with @xmath89 .",
    "it transpires that a small change in the height of the torsional barrier , which is strongly influenced by the linear expansion coefficient @xmath90 , does not affect other @xmath88 levels , but significantly influences only those with @xmath88 = 1 .",
    "varying this expansion coefficient can both increase and decrease the splitting of the @xmath88 = 1 doublet . as this splitting",
    "is overestimated in calculations using the _ ab initio _",
    "value of @xmath90 , its reduction by about 1  %  from the _ ab initio _",
    "value of 0.00487 to 0.00483 @xmath91 results in roughly a fourfold improvement of the obs ",
    "calc value for the @xmath92 levels .",
    "this change affects the value of the ground - state torsional splitting of 11 @xmath2  and also the values of the other torsional energy levels , all of which move significantly closer to the observed values , than the purely _ ab initio _  levels given in the table  [ tab : j0 ] . in particular",
    ", this small adjustment improves the calculated ground - state splitting to 11.4 @xmath2  and the first torsional level to 255.2 @xmath2 . thus adjusting @xmath90 not only improves significantly the values of levels with @xmath92 levels",
    ", it improves the overall agreement with experiment for the band origins .",
    "the underlying reason for this is that the expansion coefficient @xmath90 controls the height of the torsional barrier .",
    "these minor adjustments result in very accurate values for rotational energy levels a sample of which are presented in tables  [ tab : j1 ] , [ tab : j30 ] and [ tab : j35 ] .",
    "a more comprehensive set of energy levels is given in the supplementary material @xcite . from these tables",
    "one can see that the discrepancy between observed and calculated energy values increases both gently and smoothly with rotational quantum number @xmath1 .",
    "such calculations therefore provide an excellent starting point for assigning high @xmath1 transitions both within the ground state and to excited vibrational states , as the density of observed transitions is orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of calculations .",
    "we present results of _ ab initio _  and slightly adjusted _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the vibrational and rovibrational energy levels of the h@xmath0o@xmath0  molecule .",
    "use of the accurate _ ab initio _",
    "pes calculated by mayszek and koput @xcite reproduces the known vibrational band origin with a standard deviation of about 1 @xmath2 .",
    "the use of programme trove @xcite for the nuclear motion calculations allowed us compute high rotational levels up to @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , energy levels with @xmath94 could be calculated on a high - end workstation , and the accuracy of prediction will be very high - better than 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "however , we have not yet performed such calculations , as no comparison with experimental values is currently possible .",
    "experimentally derived energy levels up to @xmath93 are compared with our calculations .",
    "these are reproduced with an unprecedented accuracy of 0.001 @xmath2  for the levels up to @xmath95 and 0.02 @xmath2  for all the known levels above this .",
    "variational calculations using this slightly adjusted _ ab initio _  pes results in very smooth variation in the discrepancies between the observed and calculated levels as a function of the rotational quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath88 .",
    "this smoothness and accuracy is the key to the successful analysis of previously unassignable spectra @xcite as , in particular , the accidental resonances , which seriously complicate any analysis based on the use an effective hamiltonian , are automatically allowed for in such calculations .",
    "there is one other important aspect of the h@xmath0o@xmath0  rotation - vibration problem which we should mention .",
    "the detection of extrasolar planets and , in particular , our ability to probe the molecular composition of these bodies using spectroscopy @xcite , has led to demand for accurate , comprehensive line lists over an extended range of both temperature and wavelength for all species of possible importance in exoplanet atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations presented here and , especially their ability to reliably predict highly excited rotational levels which are of increasing importance at higher temperatures , suggests that the present work will provide an excellent starting point for the calculation of a comprehensive line list for h@xmath0o@xmath0 . in this",
    "we will be following the recent work of bowman and co - workers who have computed similar line lists for somewhat more rigid hydrocarbon systems @xcite .",
    "this work was performed as part of erc advanced investigator project 267219 .",
    "we also thank the russian fund for fundamental studies for their support for aspects of this project .    .",

    "<S> the purely _ ab initio </S>",
    "<S> _  calculations of the rovibrational energy levels reproduce the observed levels with a standard deviation of about 1 @xmath2 , similar to that of the @xmath3 calculation as the discrepancy between theory and experiment for rotational energies within a given vibrational state is substantially determined by the error in the vibrational band origin . </S>",
    "<S> minor adjustments are made to the _ ab initio _  equilibrium geometry and to the height of the torsional barrier . </S>",
    "<S> using these and correcting the band origins using the error in @xmath3 states lowers the standard deviation of the observed @xmath4 calculated energies to only 0.002 @xmath2  for levels up to @xmath5 and 0.02 </S>",
