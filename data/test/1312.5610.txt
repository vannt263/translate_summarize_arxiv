    "the standard theoretical scenario explains this relation by joint triggering of star formation and black hole activity via major mergers , while the black hole growth is self - regulated via active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback that shuts off star formation and quenches the accretion on to the black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) is provided by the redshift evolution of the @xmath1bulge relations . however ,",
    "direct dynamical black hole mass measurements are not feasible at higher redshifts .",
    "while integrated constraints can be obtained from the study of the black hole mass function ( bhmf ) and the agn luminosity function @xcite , the only route for observational studies on individual objects is to use broad line agn samples .",
    "the underlying assumption for this approach is that broad line agn obey the same relationship as non - active galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for broad line agn the black hole mass",
    "can be estimated employing the virial method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main challenge for these studies is to determine the properties of the agn host galaxy , targeting either the velocity dispersion @xcite , the galaxy luminosity @xcite or the stellar mass @xcite . while early studies suggested a clear trend of positive evolution in the @xmath0-bulge relation , they preferentially focused on luminous quasars and their hosts , sampling from the bright end of the agn luminosity function .",
    "more recent studies , using fainter agn , tend to find mild or no evolution @xcite .",
    "a compilation of current literature results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhmstevo ] .",
    "indeed , sample selection is a particular important issue for these studies , as selection effects are almost inevitable @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite argued that intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0-bulge relation and a steep exponential cutoff in the galaxy distribution function will lead to biased apparent relations .",
    "this bias is exacerbated by the effects of a bright flux limit in the employed agn samples . in (",
    "* hereafter sw11 ) we presented a common framework , based on the bivariate distribution function of black hole mass and spheroid property , to investigate and model the luminosity bias and other selection biases on the @xmath0-bulge relations .",
    "we additionally discussed an active fraction bias , which is introduced if only _",
    "active _ black holes are selected and if the probability to be in an active stage depends on black hole mass .",
    "it is possible to account for these effects if ( 1 ) the selection function of the respective sample is well known , and ( 2 ) the underlying distribution functions , such as the galaxy distribution function , the active bhmf and the eddington ratio distribution function ( erdf ) , are known .",
    "however , in particular at high redshift this is currently not the case .",
    "therefore , we are facing the problem that even if we are able to obtain reasonably large agn samples with individual black hole mass estimates and host galaxy property measurements , the interpretation of such results in terms of evolution or non - evolution is challenging due to the sample selection effects . in this paper",
    "we present a practical solution to this dilemma .",
    "we build on the framework presented in sw11 and give a quantitative assessment of , and a correction procedure for sample selection effects on observations of the @xmath0-bulge relations .",
    "we outline a maximum likelihood fitting approach that directly incorporates information on the selection function into the fitting .",
    "we also restrict prior knowledge of the underlying distribution functions to a minimum .",
    "the method is able to reconstruct the true unbiased @xmath0-bulge relation for an observed sample and thus largely overcomes the limitations imposed by the sample selection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] we present the general maximum likelihood fitting method and its application to the @xmath0-bulge relation for agn . in section  [ sec : predict ] we verify the robustness and uncertainties of the method via monte carlo simulations .",
    "section  [ sec : application ] illustrates the method by its application to representative previous studies and discusses its ramifications for the evolution of the @xmath0-bulge relation .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "while the main goal of the method presented here is to study the @xmath1bulge relation , it is also applicable to more general cases . identifying and characterizing correlations between two observables is a fundamental aspect of astrophysical research . given a joint distribution of two parameters with non - zero intrinsic scatter , this correlation will often be affected by the specific sample selection .",
    "we therefore first outline the general concept of the approach , before applying it to the @xmath1bulge relation .",
    "let us assume that there exists a correlation between two observational parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 for a class of objects .",
    "the space density of these objects is given by a bivariate distribution function @xmath8 .",
    "marginalizing @xmath9 over @xmath6 gives the distribution function of the variable @xmath7 , and vice versa . in the case of the @xmath1bulge relation",
    "@xmath6 is for example the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 and @xmath7 is the black hole mass @xmath11 . thus marginalizing their bivariate distribution function over @xmath10",
    "gives the bhmf , while marginalizing over @xmath11 will provide the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion function ( svdf ) .",
    "we here assume the following parameterization for the bivariate distribution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distribution function in @xmath6 , e.g. the galaxy svdf , and @xmath14 gives the probability of finding the value @xmath7 given @xmath6 .",
    "this is the intrinsic correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we here specifically assume a linear relation @xmath15 with log - normal intrinsic scatter @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 the bivariate distribution function @xmath8 describes the intrinsic joint distribution function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the universe .",
    "in practice , this will not be equal to the observed bivariate distribution for a sample , since this sample is almost always affected by implicit or explicit selection effects .",
    "we incorporate these selection criteria into a selection function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 refers to the set of additional parameters present as selection criteria , such as redshift or luminosity .",
    "the multivariate distribution @xmath20 for an observed sample is then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a set of normalized distribution functions of the parameters @xmath19 .",
    "the respective bivariate distribution @xmath23 is given by integration over @xmath19 .",
    "in general @xmath24 .",
    "this means the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , e.g. the @xmath25 relation , fitted directly to the observations is not equal to the intrinsic correlation .",
    "ignoring this inequality will lead to a bias ( see sw11 ) .    in practice , we are mainly interested in the intrinsic correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath14 and less in the full joint distribution function .",
    "the information of this intrinsic correlation is contained in the conditional probability function , but in general is not equal to it .",
    "there are two options to define the observed correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "first , the relation of @xmath7 at a given @xmath6 , and second the relation of @xmath6 at a given @xmath7 .",
    "these are given by the conditional probabilities @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 gives the probability of finding the property @xmath7 ( e.g. black hole mass ) in a galaxy with properties @xmath6 ( e.g. @xmath29 ) and @xmath19 , while @xmath30 is the probability of finding a galaxy with @xmath6 for given @xmath7 and @xmath19 .",
    "we will refer to these as forward and inverse probabilities , respectively .",
    "let us assume the special case there are no selection effects on @xmath7 .",
    "when we use the bivariate distribution given by equation  ( [ eq : psi ] ) the forward conditional probability is given by @xmath31 , i.e. the intrinsic underlying relation is directly recovered in the conditional probability . for the inverse conditional probability it follows in the absence of any selection effects @xmath32",
    "this is already a deviation from the intrinsic relation @xmath14 , even without applying any selection criteria to the sample . in the context of the @xmath1bulge relation",
    "the stellar mass function exponentially decreases at the high mass end , which together with the intrinsic scatter leads to a deviation of @xmath33 at the high mass end ( * ? ? ?",
    "this can already qualitatively explain the steeper slope found in the @xmath25 relation for galaxies with dynamical black hole mass measurements when fitting the inverse @xmath25 relation @xmath34 instead of the relation @xmath35 @xcite .    in practice selection effects",
    "are present and can produce a bias , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "however , if we know the selection function of our sample , we can incorporate this knowledge directly into the fitting of the conditional probability to recover the intrinsic relation @xmath14 .",
    "the maximum likelihood technique provides a conceptually simple way to achieve this .",
    "this method aims at minimizing the likelihood function @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the product of the likelihoods for the individual measurements .",
    "both conditional probabilities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , can serve as likelihoods , i.e. we either minimize @xmath41 @xmath42 to obtain the best - fitting parameters of @xmath14 .",
    "we here refer to the minimization of @xmath43 as forward ml regression and of @xmath44 as inverse ml regression .",
    "we emphasize that these maximum likelihood fits go beyond a simple linear regression , since we are not only fitting a model to the data , but incorporate additional information about the data set and the underlying distributions .",
    "thereby , the used conditional probability function can have an arbitrarily complex form .",
    "we will refer to the more standard approach of fitting the conditional probability @xmath45 without including the effects of sample selection as simple regression.    which of the two maximum likelihood fit options ( forward / inverse ) is the preferred choice depends on the specific selection effects , and on the underlying distributions .",
    "for example , when there are no selection effects then forward regression is preferable , since the fitted conditional probability is equal to the intrinsic relation @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the maximum likelihood fit is equal to a simple regression approach , used in other studies to fit the @xmath25 relation for quiescent galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the inverse ml regression ( using equation  [ eq : cond_smu_int ] ) requires additional information about the distribution function @xmath13 and is therefore more complicated to use",
    "however , in the presence of selection effects on @xmath7 the inverse ml regression might become preferable , since it can be unaffected by the selection effects , in contrast to the forward ml regression .",
    "we will illustrate this below for the @xmath1bulge relation for active galaxies .    while other applications of this method are possible , in the following we focus on the specific case of studying the @xmath1bulge relation at high redshift via broad line agn samples .",
    "in sw11 we discussed the qualitative influence of sample selection effects on observations of the @xmath1bulge relation for broad line agn samples in detail within our framework of the bivariate distribution function .",
    "the @xmath1bulge relation is given by @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the logarithmic black hole mass and @xmath48 is the logarithm of the host galaxy property , e.g. @xmath10 or @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the normalization and the slope of the relation .",
    "thus in the above terminology @xmath52 and @xmath53 . with the parametrization of equation  ( [ eq : psi ] ) , the bivariate distribution function is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the spheroid distribution function and @xmath56 is the intrinsic @xmath1bulge relation .",
    "integrating this bivariate distribution function over @xmath48 gives the total bhmf .",
    "for an agn sample the main selection criteria will be the agn flux .",
    "therefore , the selection function will depend on agn luminosity and redshift .",
    "the agn luminosity is determined by the black hole mass @xmath0 and the accretion rate , the latter is represented by the eddington ratio @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "this implies a selection function @xmath59 , depending on black hole mass , eddington ratio and redshift .",
    "the corresponding distribution function is the bivariate distribution function of black hole mass and eddington ratio for active black holes @xmath60 , with its projections the active bhmf and the erdf .",
    "we here make the assumption that the bivariate distribution function of black hole mass and eddington ratio is separable into an independent bhmf and erdf , i.e. @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the erdf , normalized to one and @xmath63 is the active bhmf .",
    "this assumption is motivated by results on the local bivariate distribution function of @xmath64 and @xmath65@xcite and by the observation of an eddington ratio distribution of agn that is independent of stellar mass @xcite , suggesting also an independence of @xmath64 [ but see @xcite for evidence of a @xmath64 dependence of the erdf ] .",
    "we comment on the consequences of relaxing this assumption below .",
    "the active bhmf is related to the total bhmf via the active fraction , which gives the probability for a black hole to be in an active ( type  1 agn ) state as a function of black hole mass and redshift .",
    "it is defined by the ratio of active bhmf to total bhmf , @xmath66 .",
    "the latter is directly linked to the bivariate distribution of @xmath64 and @xmath48 ( equation  ( [ eq : psi_agn ] ) ) .    following equation  ( [ eq : psio ] ) , the multivariate probability distribution @xmath67 of galaxy property , black hole mass , eddington ratio and redshift is then given by @xmath68 where @xmath59 is the agn selection function of the respective sample .",
    "the conditional probability for the forward ml regression then follows as @xmath69 the erdf @xmath70 and the galaxy distribution function @xmath71 cancel out and are not required for the fitting .",
    "we require only knowledge of the selection function and of the mass dependence of the active fraction to obtain the intrinsic @xmath1bulge relation from the fit to the conditional probability .",
    "the free parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath16 in the intrinsic relation @xmath56 are obtained by minimizing equation  [ eq : sx ] .",
    "if the erdf is mass dependent it will not cancel out and knowledge of the erdf is additionally required .",
    "second , the conditional probability for the inverse ml regression is @xmath72 this is identical to the case without agn selection effects ( equation  [ eq : cond_smu_int ] ) , i.e. the conditional probability @xmath73 is not affected by the agn selection .",
    "we already discussed this fact in sw11 , but we will use it here to recover the intrinsic relation by the maximum likelihood fit . the only quantity that has to be known to recover the intrinsic relation is the galaxy distribution function .",
    "both fitting options have their pros and cons .",
    "while the latter is largely unaffected by agn selection effects , it is susceptible to the shape of the galaxy distribution function and also more susceptible to the intrinsic scatter in the relation itself .",
    "the former does not require any knowledge about @xmath71 , but demands a proper understanding of the sample selection and also of the underlying distribution function of agn or at least the active fraction for the agn sample .",
    "both regression methods constitute an improvement for the determination of the intrinsic @xmath1bulge relation , compared to a standard regression that does not include knowledge of the selection function or galaxy distribution function , as we will illustrate below .      in practice ,",
    "the situation becomes more complicated , since black hole mass and galaxy property measurements have measurement uncertainties .",
    "virial black hole masses are associated with a non - negligible uncertainty of @xmath74  dex @xcite , while also agn host galaxy properties at high @xmath75 have significant measurement errors .",
    "these lead to second - order dependencies of the conditional probabilities . in sw11",
    "we already studied the consequences of measurement uncertainties on the bivariate distribution and the @xmath1bulge relations . here",
    ", we discuss the ramifications of measurement uncertainties on the presented fitting approach .",
    "we assume that the black hole mass estimated by the virial method @xmath76 is drawn from a log - normal probability distribution around the true black hole mass @xmath64 , with dispersion @xmath77 , representing the uncertainty in the virial mass estimate , @xmath78 for the galaxy property @xmath48 we also assume a log - normal error distribution @xmath79 with dispersion @xmath80 .",
    "the bivariate distribution function for bulge property and virial black hole mass is then @xmath81 the bivariate distribution function is smoothed out by the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the conditional probability for the forward ml regression is @xmath82 assuming we know the measurement uncertainties @xmath77 and @xmath80 , these can be directly incorporated into the fit .",
    "however , we now introduce a dependence on the galaxy distribution @xmath71 into the forward ml regression which was canceled out before . to avoid this dependence",
    ", we can make the simplifying assumption @xmath83 .",
    "this approximation is justified for a small measurement error in @xmath48 and in particular in the flat part of the galaxy distribution function .",
    "it will break down for high stellar velocity dispersion or high stellar mass , i.e. at the exponential decline of the galaxy distribution function .",
    "it can be applied to samples dominated by lower mass galaxies .",
    "equation  [ eq : condprob_agn_mus ] then simplifies to @xmath84 we will refer to both options as forward ml regression with measurement errors .",
    "the conditional probability for the inverse ml regression is given by @xmath85 for this case , the dependence of the conditional probability on the active fraction and on the selection function is not canceled out as it was the case without measurement uncertainty in @xmath64 .",
    "this effectively prevents ignoring the agn selection function for the fit of the @xmath0-bulge relations for observational samples .    we can again derive an approximation to the probability distribution by making the simplifying assumptions @xmath86 and @xmath87 , for which equation  ( [ eq : condprob_agn_smu ] ) reduces to @xmath88 for this approximation no knowledge of the agn selection function and the active fraction is required anymore .",
    "the assumption on the selection function depends on the details of the sample selection , but in general will be true in most cases , unless the object is close to the selection threshold ( e.g. to the flux limit of the survey ) .",
    "the assumption on the active fraction requires an active fraction with a weak or no black hole mass dependence .",
    "this is , for example , the case at @xmath2 , as discussed in section  [ sec : app_z15 ] , but not in the local universe @xcite .",
    "therefore , in practice some idea about the active fraction is required in any case to judge the validity of this approximation .",
    "we will refer to these maximum likelihood fits as inverse ml regression with measurement errors .",
    "we here presented several options to fit for the underlying relation using a given sample with measurement uncertainties . which of these is the best choice for the specific sample will depend on the details of the sample selection and our knowledge of this selection function and the galaxy distribution function .",
    "formally , the most precise results are obtained using the conditional probabilities for either the forward or inverse ml regression given by equations  [ eq : condprob_agn_mus ] and [ eq : condprob_agn_smu ] .",
    "this requires knowledge of the selection function , the active fraction and of the galaxy distribution function . to restrict the assumptions for the respective fit",
    ", we can also use the approximations given by equations  [ eq : condprob_agn_mus_simp ] and [ eq : condprob_agn_smu_simp ] . while not precise , this approach can be justified if the selection function and/or the underlying distributions are only poorly known .",
    "to illustrate the method and test its reliability we carried out monte carlo simulations of the @xmath4 relation . for our simulations we chose as representative redshift @xmath89 .",
    "for the galaxy spheroid mass function we assume the estimate given in sw11 , which is based on the stellar mass function from @xcite , applying a rough correction for the bulge - to - total ratio to translate it into a spheroid mass function .",
    "we set up the simulations by first drawing a large number of objects from the spheroid mass function at @xmath89 .",
    "black hole masses are attributed according to the @xmath90 relation from @xcite with log - normal intrinsic scatter @xmath91 .",
    "we here assumed a constant active fraction , consistent with recent results on the active bhmf at @xmath2 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* schulze et al . in prep . ) and empirical models @xcite .",
    "for the active black holes an eddington ratio was drawn from the @xmath2 erdf from @xcite . black hole mass and eddington ratio define the bolometric agn luminosity .",
    "we convert @xmath92 into @xmath93-band magnitude using the agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from @xcite and the @xmath94-correction from @xcite .",
    "we applied three flux limits to the simulated samples , @xmath95=20 , 22 and 24  mag , respectively , and generated samples of various sizes .",
    "for each flux limit and sample size we generated 1000 monte carlo realizations .    for simplicity ,",
    "we first discuss the results without measurement errors .",
    "we will discuss the effect of adding measurement errors further below .",
    "each simulation realization was fitted by a forward and an inverse ml regression .",
    "furthermore , for each regression we fitted the realizations with a different set of free parameters .",
    "we first kept all three parameters ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath16 ) free .",
    "secondly we fixed @xmath16 and finally we also fixed @xmath51 to the input value , leaving only the normalization as free parameter .",
    "additionally , we fitted each realization with a simple linear regression , i.e. not including the selection effects , both with @xmath64 and with @xmath48 as dependent variable .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcfit ] , we illustrate the strength of our proposed fitting approach ( shown as black histograms , left for the forward ml regression and right for the inverse ml regression ) , compared to a simple linear regression ( shown as green histograms ) .",
    "we use 1000 realizations of a sample of @xmath96 objects at @xmath89 with @xmath97  mag .",
    "while the dispersion on the fitting parameters is increased , the bias present in the simple regression approach is removed . in this example",
    "we leave all three parameters free in the fit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : statsx ] we show the median and 68% confidence limits of the 1000 realizations for a forward ml regression for different flux limits and sample sizes .",
    "the magnitude limits of @xmath98  mag correspond to bolometric luminosity limits of @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the left panel shows that we systematically underestimate @xmath16 for a small sample size when keeping it as a free parameter .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fitting procedure determines the _ sample _ standard deviation , which is known to be an underestimate of the _ population _ standard deviation .",
    "this underestimate for small sample sizes is already present in the conventional fit without including the selection function .",
    "since the intrinsic scatter is an important parameter , when the selection effects are included this underestimate is enhanced . also the best - fitting solutions for the normalization @xmath50 and the slope",
    "@xmath51 will be biased .",

    ", the slope @xmath51 and normalization @xmath50 are recovered unbiased irrespective of sample size , as shown in the other three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : statsx ] .",
    "increasing the sample size mainly reduces the statistical errors , shown by the dashed lines .",
    "fixing also the slope and keeping the normalization as only free parameter further reduces the statistical error , while the input is recovered in the mean .",
    "we further see that the error is basically independent of the flux limit",
    ". however , this assumes perfect knowledge of the selection function and underlying distribution .",
    "deeper samples are less susceptible to uncertainties in these and therefore come closer to the statistical errors shown here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : statsy ] we show the same for the inverse ml regression . keeping the intrinsic scatter",
    "as a free parameter also leads to an underestimate for small sample sizes and we again suggest to fix it for small samples , @xmath100 , to avoid a bias in the slope and normalization .",
    "but even when fixing @xmath16 we find in our simulations a small bias in @xmath50 and @xmath51 for very small samples , @xmath101",
    ". however , for such small samples the errors on the best fit are also large .",
    "a joint determination of slope and normalization of the relation requires a reasonably large sample .",
    "when fixing the slope @xmath51 and only determining the normalization @xmath50 , an unbiased result with small error can be achieved even for relatively small sample sizes , as demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : statsy ] .",
    "we now investigate the consequences of adding measurement errors in the virial black hole masses and in the host galaxy properties to the simulations .",
    "we here test our prescription for including these uncertainties , as presented in section  [ sec : mu ] and compare them to a regression without measurement errors .",

    "the null hypothesis of no evolution in the @xmath113relation for both cases lies within @xmath114 of our results , thus it is not rejected with statistical significance .",

    "this implies that the uncertainty estimates above are rather optimistic , since they only include statistical uncertainties and not additional uncertainties in the underlying assumptions .",
    "the likelihood for the null hypothesis of no evolution is then even higher than the @xmath114 mentioned above when those uncertainties are also included in the confidence determination .    to get an estimate for the effect of uncertainties in the underlying distribution function",
    ", we varied the assumed stellar mass function from @xcite within their quoted uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , we varied the bulge - to - total ratio between our default correction and no correction at all , to investigate the importance of the transformation of the galaxy mass function to a spheroid mass function .",
    "the uncertainty in the stellar mass function adds an uncertainty of @xmath116 to the best - fitting @xmath117 , while not applying an bulge - to - total correction increases the best - fitting solution by @xmath118 .",
    "even more important is a precise calibration of the local zero - point , as it is illustrated by the opposite trends of evolution found for the local relations by @xcite and @xcite , which is mainly caused by the increase in the zero - point of the @xmath119 relation of @xcite .",
    "while the local zero - point of the @xmath119 relation increased in the most recent revised determinations of the relation @xcite , the @xmath120 factor and thus the calibration to the agn samples is not strongly affected by this revision @xcite . using this revised @xmath119 relation",

    "combined with the correction for the bias caused by sample selection this even suggests or is at least consistent with a negative evolution of the @xmath119 relation where galaxy bulges grow first and the black holes have to catch up .    in summary , we see no statistically significant evidence for evolution in the @xmath113relation based on this data set , consistent with our more qualitative analysis in sw11",

    "this seems to provide the most convincing evidence for strong evolution in the @xmath1bulge relations .",
    "however , these luminous qso studies are only sampling from the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "for this kind of objects the bias caused by selection effects is most severe , as discussed in sw11 .",
    "furthermore , current sample sizes at @xmath121 are small , inhibiting firm statistical conclusions .",
    "we now endeavor to test quantitatively if the strong apparent offset found in these studies provides any statistically significant evidence for an intrinsic offset , once we account for sample selection .",
    "we focus on the highest redshift regime currently studied @xmath3 and the constraints that can be drawn on evolution in the @xmath1bulge relations .",
    "we used the sample from @xcite , and restricted it to the six objects selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath122 quasar survey @xcite , which approximately might be considered a well - defined sample .",
    "for this sample we assume a selection function given by the survey magnitude limit of @xmath123  mag .",
    "black hole masses are for some of the objects estimated from the broad lines and for the rest from the bolometric luminosity , assuming eddington limited accretion .",
    "bulge masses are derived from dynamical mass measurements ( we assume an average inclination angle of @xmath124 ) , and stellar velocity dispersions were estimated from the width of molecular co line emission .",
    "there are still significant systematic uncertainties associated with these measurements and how they relate to galaxy masses and velocity dispersion measured for local galaxies .",
    "however , we here only discuss the statistical aspects of the sample .",
    "the dynamical range in black hole mass and agn luminosity covered by this sample is small and there is basically no apparent correlation between @xmath0 and either @xmath29 or @xmath125 .",
    "we therefore fixed the slope and intrinsic scatter and only fit for an evolution in the normalization , again parametrized by a parameter @xmath117 .",
    "for the stellar mass function we assume the mass function for star forming galaxies at @xmath126 from @xcite .",
    "we again assume a constant active fraction .",
    "using the forward regression with measurement errors we find @xmath127 at @xmath128 confidence , with a best fit of @xmath129 for the @xmath113relation , using the local relation from @xcite .",

    "it is not clear at all to what degree the co line width traces the stellar velocity distribution at these redshift .",
    "we here simply try to bracket our ignorance about the svdf at @xmath3 and investigate their consequences on the results for the @xmath25 relation .",
    "note that for the correction only the shape of the distribution function is important , in particular the location of the schechter function cutoff , not its normalization .",
    "we started from the evolution of the stellar mass function between @xmath136 and @xmath126 , comparing the mass functions from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they show a decrease of the break of the mass function of @xmath138  dex . assuming virialized systems",
    ", we can convert this into a shift for the svdf .",
    "however , this also requires a parameterization of the size evolution of galaxies . at @xmath5",
    "massive galaxies are more compact by a factor of @xmath139 , compared to local galaxies of similar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming similar compact galaxies at @xmath140 this approximately balances out the evolution in the mass function , i.e. no evolution in the break of the svdf would be required , consistent with observations out to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we use the local svdf from @xcite and converted it to a rough guess for the shape of the svdf at @xmath141 , testing two extreme evolution scenarios : ( 1 ) no effective evolution in the svdf , due to an approximate balance between mass evolution and size evolution of galaxies , ( 2 ) no size evolution , leading to a decrease in the break of the svdf , consistent with the mass function evolution .",
    "for the first case we find @xmath142 at @xmath128 confidence , with a best fit of @xmath143 , compared to the local @xmath25 relation of @xcite , while the second case gives @xmath144 at @xmath128 confidence , with a best fit of @xmath145 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitz_wang10 ] , we show the data and the best - fitting results for the @xmath146 and the @xmath25 relation .    while the uncertainties in the parameters are large , due to both the small number statistics and the uncertainty in the underlying distributions , the results are fully consistent with no evolution in the @xmath1bulge relations .",
    "thus , even while these @xmath3 qsos show large apparent offsets from the local relation , this can not be taken as evidence for intrinsic evolution in the @xmath1bulge relations up to high @xmath75 .",
    "the apparent offset is consistent with being fully caused by agn sample selection effects .",
    "even negative evolution in the @xmath1bulge relations at @xmath3 is fully consistent with these data .    besides current methodical challenges in determining black hole masses and galaxy properties at @xmath3 , the significance on the @xmath1bulge relation at high @xmath75 is currently limited by small sample sizes and their bright flux limits .",
    "ongoing and future surveys , like ukidss , pan - starrs , vista , sumire / hyper - suprime cam , lsst will significantly increase the number of known @xmath3 qsos and future sub - mm observations of their host galaxies , in particular using the atacama large millimeter / submillimetre array ( alma ) , will open a new window to the study of their host galaxies and are able to obtain dynamical masses from molecular line emission for a reasonably large sample of high-@xmath75 qsos @xcite .      while we here do not aim at a full investigation of the literature on the evolution of the @xmath1bulge relation , we want to summarize the current constraints we have on evolution or non - evolution .",
    "we base this on samples that are representative for the best data at their respective redshift , in terms of depth and well defined sample selection .",
    "we include the samples from @xcite and @xcite discussed above . additionally , we augmented this by the samples from @xcite at @xmath147 and @xcite at @xmath148 .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 32 agn at @xmath149 , selected from _",
    "xmm_-cosmos and report basically no offset from the local relation from @xcite for their sample . using the _ xmm_-cosmos soft x - ray flux limit , the stellar mass function from @xcite , and assuming a constant active fraction , we find an insignificant bias for this sample .",
    "thus , our inferred intrinsic relation is also fully consistent with the local relation from @xcite .",
    "however , compared to the local relation from @xcite the sample is offset by @xmath150  dex .",
    "this might indicate a systematic offset in the normalization of the virial black hole mass estimates , for example due to selection effects ( sw11 ) . in the following we use the @xmath1bulge relation from @xcite as local zero - point as a conservative constraint on possible positive evolution .",
    "@xcite could resolve the host galaxies for two luminous qsos at @xmath151 , selected from the sdss , with an additional selection criteria @xmath152  mag . to account for the selection effects",
    ", we applied this absolute magnitude limit and assume the mass function for star - forming galaxies at @xmath148 from @xcite and a constant active fraction .",
    "the best - fitting result for the forward regression is @xmath153 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhevo_intrinsic ] we summarize our study of the _ intrinsic _ evolution in the @xmath1bulge relation for these four samples .",
    "the _ apparent _ offset from the local relation is shown by the open symbols , while our inferred _ intrinsic _ offset is given by the filled symbols . while there is an apparent evolution trend , accounting for selection effects we find an _",
    "intrinsic _ offset that is fully consistent with a non - evolving @xmath1bulge relation out to @xmath3 .",
    "however , we note that at @xmath154 the uncertainties on the @xmath1bulge relation are still substantial and future work in particular in this redshift regime is necessary to obtain robust results . for reference",
    "we also indicate the case of @xmath155 , predicted by some numerical simulations @xcite , by the dashed dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhevo_intrinsic ] .",
    "current data are not able to robustly distinguish between a @xmath155 scenario and a non - evolving @xmath1bulge relation .",
    "while the redshift evolution of the @xmath1bulge relation provides important constraints on black hole - galaxy co - evolution , its observational study is hampered by severe selection effects .",
    "we presented a novel fitting method to the @xmath1bulge relations and their evolution .",
    "this method corrects for the bias on the @xmath1bulge relation caused by sample selection and is able to recover the intrinsic relation in the fitting .",
    "it does so by incorporating the selection function of the observational sample and the underlying distribution function into the conditional probability distribution of black hole mass at given bulge property or vice versa .",
    "this probability distribution is derived from the bivariate distribution function of @xmath0 and bulge property .",
    "the intrinsic relation is reconstructed via a maximum likelihood fit of this conditional probability distribution to the data .",
    "since we are not modeling or fitting the full bivariate distribution function but only the conditional probability distribution , we can reduce the set of prior knowledge or assumptions to correct for the selection bias , compared to our discussion in sw11 .",
    "we presented two routes to fit the conditional probability : ( 1 ) using the probability of finding @xmath0 at a given bulge property ( forward regression ) , and ( 2 ) using the probability of finding a specific value for the bulge property at a given @xmath0 ( inverse regression ) .",
    "for the first case it is essential to properly understand the selection of the sample and have a fair estimate of the black hole mass dependence of the active fraction .",
    "for the second case the bulge distribution function and the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath1bulge relation need to be known .",
    "when measurement errors on @xmath0 and the bulge property can not be ignored , all of these prior assumptions have to be known for a full correction .",
    "we extensively tested the fitting method on monte carlo simulations and verified the reliability of the approach to recover evolution in the normalization unbiased .",
    "we also illustrated the method by applying it to literature data from @xmath147 to @xmath3 .",
    "the sample of @xcite at @xmath2 already puts significant constraints on the redshift evolution of the @xmath4 relation . assuming the local relation from @xcite",
    ", we can constrain the evolution in the @xmath4 relation to @xmath156 out to redshift @xmath5 at @xmath157 confidence .",
    "this is in general agreement with our conclusions in sw11 and with recent results at lower redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking these empirical clues together , it becomes apparent that there is currently no evidence for significant positive evolution in the @xmath1bulge relation out to @xmath5 .",
    "either black holes and galaxies grow almost co - eval since @xmath5 , or galaxies grow faster and the black holes would have to catch up to end up at the local relation at @xmath136 .",
    "the latter is also suggested by observations of @xmath5 smgs @xcite . within @xmath158",
    "most of the black hole growth is governed by secular processes and not by major mergers @xcite .",
    "these processes probably grow the black hole at the same rate as the spheroid component .",
    "this changes at @xmath154 , beyond the peak of agn activity , where major mergers likely become the dominating black hole growth mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore also a change in the evolution of the @xmath4 relation could be expected at @xmath154 .",
    "currently , this redshift regime is still poorly covered by observations , and usually restricted to the most luminous , and hence most biased , qsos .",
    "we illustrated the poor constraints that can be drawn from current observations , employing a @xmath3 qso sample based on @xcite .",
    "while the sample shows a large _ apparent _ positive offset from the local relation , we find here that there is no _ intrinsic _ offset , i.e. it is fully consistent with no or even negative evolution when sample selection is taken into account .",
    "we therefore conclude that even at @xmath154 and in particular at @xmath3 we currently have no statistically significant evidence for evolution in the @xmath4 relation .",
    "we confirmed these results by additionally studying the low redshift sample from @xcite and the small @xmath148 sample from @xcite .",
    "future studies will reduce the observational uncertainties and increase the sample size and will allow a better assessment of the @xmath4 relation at these early cosmic epochs .",
    "we will discuss the requirements on the design of these future studies of the @xmath4 relation in this redshift regime in a companion paper .    while selection effects severely complicate the observational study of the @xmath1bulge relation at high redshift , these can be included in the analysis as we have demonstrated here .",
    "we anticipate that the method presented here will contribute to an improved understanding of black hole - galaxy co - evolution .",
    "however , essential prerequisites are ( 1 ) the use of a well defined sample , i.e. the selection function for the sample has to be under control , and ( 2 ) knowledge of the underlying demographics of galaxies and active black holes over the black hole mass and galaxy property range covered by the observations . given the expected future increase in the size of well defined samples and a better understanding of the underlying black hole and galaxy demographics , we anticipate that we will be able to trace back the cosmic history of the @xmath1bulge relations in the future .",
