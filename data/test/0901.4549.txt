    "galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) are believed to be accelerated via first order fermi mechanism at the expanding shock waves of supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two of the strongest points supporting this scenario are : _",
    "i ) _ the fact that snrs alone are capable to maintain the galactic cr flux at the observed level , provided that a fraction of about 10% of their explosion energy is somehow converted into crs @xcite , and _",
    "ii ) _ the fact that some shell - type snrs have been detected at tev energies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , as expected if they indeed are the sources of crs @xcite . in this context ,",
    "tev gamma rays originate from the decay of neutral pions produced in interactions between the accelerated crs and the interstellar gas swept up by the snr shock .    however , the detection of snrs in gamma rays , though encouraging , can not provide by itself the final proof that crs are indeed accelerated at snr shocks .",
    "this is because competing leptonic processes , namely inverse compton scattering from accelerated electrons , can also explain the observed tev emission , provided that the magnetic field does not significantly exceed @xmath0 g ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for strong @xmath1 g magnetic field , and thus indirect support to the hadronic scenario for the gamma ray emission , comes from the observation of thin x - ray synchrotron filaments surrounding some snrs @xcite and of the rapid variability time scale of the synchrotron x ",
    "rays @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of thermal x - ray emission from the tev snrs rxj1713.7 - 3946 and rxj0852.0 - 4622 has been interpreted by katz and waxman ( 2008 ) as an argument against the hadronic nature of the gamma - ray emission ( and thus supporting the leptonic scenario ) .",
    "their argument can be summarized as follows : in order to fit the tev data with an hadronic model , the gas density can not be too low . the high density would then imply a strong x - ray thermal bremsstrahlung emission which is not observed . however , this argument is not robust given the uncertainties related to the heating of electrons at shocks , and it has been strongly questioned @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the downstream proton temperature can be effectively reduced if the shock is effectively accelerating cosmic rays .",
    "this would also suppress the electron temperature and the thermal x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "a conclusive proof of the hadronic nature of the gamma - ray emission will possibly come from the detection of neutrinos from snrs , which are expected to be produced during the same hadronic interactions responsible for the production of gamma rays @xcite .",
    "however , since the detection of neutrinos appears challenging even for km@xmath2-scale neutrino telescopes , the search for evidence of cr proton acceleration coming from gamma ray or multi wavelength observations is mandatory .",
    "the presence of a massive molecular cloud close to a snr can provide a dense target for cr hadronic interactions and thus enhance the expected gamma - ray emission . a correlation between snrs and molecular clouds",
    "is expected , especially in star forming regions @xcite . in general , a spatial correlation between tev gamma rays and dense gas , though not conclusive , would favor an hadronic scenario , where gamma rays are the result of the interactions of cr protons in the dense gas .",
    "such correlation has been observed from a number of snr / molecular clouds associations @xcite .",
    "if the molecular cloud is overtaken by the snr shock , the enhanced gamma - ray emission is expected to be cospatial with the snr shell , or with a portion of it @xcite .",
    "if the cloud is located at some distance from the snr , it can still be illuminated by crs that escape from the snr and produce gamma rays there @xcite . for this scenario",
    ", it has been shown that , for typical snr parameters and for a distance @xmath3  kpc , a molecular cloud of mass @xmath4 can emit tev gamma rays at a detectable level if it is located within few hundred parsecs from the snr @xcite .",
    "this implies that the angular displacement between the snr shell and the gamma ray emission is of the order of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance between the snr and the cloud .",
    "this translates in the fact that sometimes the association between snrs and molecular clouds can be not so obvious , given that the separation between the two objects can be even larger than the detector s field of view . following this rationale , gabici and aharonian ( 2007 ) proposed that some of the unidentified tev sources detected by hegra @xcite , h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite and milagro @xcite might in fact be such clouds illuminated by a nearby snr .    in this paper , we calculate the expected non - thermal emission , from radio to multi - tev photons , from a molecular cloud illuminated by crs coming from a nearby snr .",
    "we generalize the model presented by gabici and aharonian ( 2007 ) , which was limited to the hadronic tev photons only , to include the generation of secondary electrons in the cloud and the related synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "we found that the total radiation energy output from a cloud is dominated by the gamma ray emission , which can exceed the emission in other bands by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "this suggests that some of the unidentified tev sources detected so far , with no obvious or very weak counterparts in other wavelengths ( the so called `` dark sources '' ) , might be in fact associated with massive molecular clouds illuminated by crs .",
    "moreover , under certain conditions , the gamma - ray spectrum from the cloud exhibit a concave shape , being steep at low ( @xmath7 gev ) energies and hard at high ( @xmath7 tev ) energies .",
    "this fact might have important implications for the studies of the spectral compatibility of gev and tev gamma ray sources .",
    "consider a supernova of total energy @xmath8 exploding in a medium of density @xmath9 .",
    "the initial shock velocity is @xmath10 cm / s and remains roughly constant until the mass of the swept up material equals the mass of the ejecta .",
    "this happens at a time @xmath11^{1/3 } { \\rm yr}$ ] , when the shock radius is @xmath12^{1/3 } { \\rm pc}$ ] .",
    "then the snr enters the sedov phase and the shock radius and velocity scales with time as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the spectrum of particles accelerated at the snr shock is determined by the transport equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the momentum dependent diffusion coefficient and @xmath17 the flow velocity .",
    "for a strong shock with compression factor @xmath18 , the test particle theory predicts an universal shape for the cr spectrum at the shock @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "if the shock is an efficient accelerator ( as snr shocks are believed to be ) , the cr pressure modifies the flow structure , making the shock more compressible and the spectrum of the accelerated particles harder , @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations compared with multiwavelength observations of snrs suggest the values @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , which we adopt in the following .",
    "the maximum momentum of the accelerated particles is determined by a confinement condition , namely that the diffusion length @xmath24 of the particles can not exceed the characteristic size of the system @xmath25 : @xmath26 the maximum possible energies are achieved when the acceleration proceeds in the bohm diffusion limit , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the magnetic field strength at the shock . in this case the maximum momentum decreases with time as @xmath29 . in fact , the drop of @xmath30 is even faster , given that the magnetic field is also expected to decrease with time .",
    "this implies that at any time , particles with momentum above @xmath31 quickly escape the remnant , generating a cutoff in the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the runaway particles can be approximated as a @xmath32function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath33 @xmath34 where the integration has to be performed where the integrand is negative . thus , to calculate the flux of the runaway particles one has to know : _ ( i ) _ the cr particle distribution function at @xmath30 at any location in the snr , _",
    "( ii ) _ the flow velocity both inside the shock and outside it , where the cr precursor forms and _ ( iii ) _ how the maximum momentum varies during the snr evolution .",
    "ptuskin and zirakashvili ( 2005 ) showed that it is straigthforward to derive _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ using an approximate ( but still reasonably accurate ) linear velocity profile inside the snr : @xmath35 and assuming that the cr pressure at the shock @xmath36 is a fraction @xmath37 of the incoming ram pressure @xmath38 and that @xmath39 .",
    "the determination of @xmath30 and its evolution with time requires the knowledge of the diffusion coefficient ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : pmax ] ) , which is in turn determined by the level of magnetic turbulence generated by the accelerated particles themselves .",
    "this makes the problem nonlinear and very difficult to be solved .",
    "the value of @xmath30 depends on a few crucial but poorly known aspects of the problem , including the nature of cr  driven instability operating in the shock precursor and the level of wave damping @xcite . because of these uncertainties ,",
    "we adopt here a phenomenological approach , namely we parametrize the maximum momentum as @xmath40 .",
    "we further assume @xmath41 pev and @xmath42 gev at the early ( @xmath43 yr ) and late ( @xmath44 yr ) epochs of the sedov phase respectively .",
    "this requires @xmath45 .",
    "remarkably , if the maximum momentum is a power law function of time , the spectrum of the escaping particles integrated over the whole sedov phase is also a power law of the form @xmath46 @xcite , which is close ( sligthly harder ) to what needed to fit the cr data below the knee @xcite .",
    "following ptuskin and zirakashvili ( 2003 ) , the approximate spectrum of the crs inside the snr @xmath47 can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : transport ] by dropping the diffusion term , while the spectrum of the runaway crs at a given distance @xmath48 from the snr and at a given time @xmath49 can be obtained by solving the diffusion equation : @xmath50 the diffusion coefficient @xmath51 describes the propagation of crs in the galactic disk .",
    "the available cr data require a power  law energy dependence , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 at @xmath54 gev and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the diffusion coefficient are obtained from the comparison between diffusion models and cr data and have to be considered as average galactic values . however",
    ", the conditions might be rather different in regions close to cr sources , in particular due to the presence of strong gradients in the cr distribution , which may enhance the generation of plasma waves and thus suppress the diffusion coefficient @xcite . the change in @xmath56 within the allowed range or the choice of a different normalization for @xmath57 does not alter qualitatively the results , the main effect being that the characteristic time scales of the problem change proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "remarkably , if @xmath31 scales as a power law of time , eq . [ eq : diffusionism ] can be solved analytically and the distribution function of escaping cosmic rays at any given distance @xmath48 from the snr and at any given time @xmath49 reads , for energies @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the total supernova explosion energy , @xmath62 is the fraction of such energy converted into crs and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the maximum and minimum energies of crs accelerated during the sedov phase .",
    "the diffusion distance for a cr of energy @xmath65 is : @xmath66 where @xmath67 represents the time after the supernova explosion at which crs with energy @xmath65 are released in the interstellar medium .",
    "the solution derived by ptuskin and zirakashvili ( 2005 ) for the total cr spectrum injected by a snr in the interstellar medium during the whole sedov phase can be easily derived by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : crout ] over space . finally , it has to be noticed that the total cr spectrum at a given time and at a given distance from the snr is the sum of two contributions : _",

    "if the diffusion coefficient inside the cloud is not significantly smaller than the galactic one , cr freely penetrate the cloud and the cr spectrum inside the cloud is not affected by propagation effects .",
    "conversely , if the diffusion coefficient is significantly ( more than one order of magnitude ) reduced , low energy crs are excluded from the cloud and a low energy cutoff appears in the cr spectrum , at an energy that depends on the value of the diffusion coefficient ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . here , we assume free penetration of crs and we refer the reader to gabici et al . (",
    "2007 ) ( and references therein ) for a detailed discussion on cr exclusions from molecular clouds .",
    "we do not consider here any contribution from cr electrons coming from the snr , since they do not escape the remnant due to diffusive confinement ( for low energy electrons ) and severe synchrotron losses in the strong magnetic field ( for high energy electrons ) .",
    "cr protons propagating inside a molecular cloud produce secondary electron - positron pairs during inelastic interactions in the dense intercloud medium .",
    "we calculate the spectrum of the injected secondary electrons @xmath68 by using the parameterization given by kelner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and we follow the time evolution of the electron distribution function @xmath69 by solving the equation : @xmath70 + q_e(t , e ) - \\frac{f_e(t , e)}{\\tau_{esc}^e}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the energy loss rate for electrons , @xmath72 the energy loss time , and @xmath73 the diffusive escape time from the cloud .",
    "all these time scales will be discussed and estimated in section 4 . once the proton and electron cr spectra have been derived , the non - thermal radiation from the molecular cloud can be calculated .",
    "we consider here a molecular cloud located at a given distance @xmath6 from a snr and we calculate the cr spectrum at the cloud location . as mentioned above",
    ", the spectrum is the sum of two disctinct components : _",
    "i ) _ the crs coming from the nearby snr , described by eq .",
    "[ eq : crout ] , and _",

    "[ fig : crs ] shows the spectrum of crs at the location of the molecular cloud .",
    "the galactic cr background is plotted as a thin dot  dashed line labeled as _ cr sea _ , while the spectrum of the crs coming from the snr is plotted as a thin line for different times after the supernova explosion : 500 yr ( solid ) , 2000 yr ( dotted ) , 8000 yr ( short  dashed ) and 32000 yr ( long  dashed ) .",
    "thick lines represent the sum of the two contributions .",
    "the distance between the snr and the molecular cloud is 50 pc ( left panel ) and 100 pc ( right panel ) .",
    "we assume a total supernova explosion energy of @xmath74 ergs and a high cr acceleration efficiency at the snr shock equal to @xmath75 .",
    "the normalization of the cr spectrum at the cloud scales linearly with these two quantities .",
    ", since the estimated flux of particles escaping the snr comes from a nonlinear theory of shock acceleration ] the diffuse galactic cosmic ray spectrum is assumed to be identical to the one observed near the sun ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath76 while the diffusion coefficient , needed to evaluate eq .",
    "[ eq : crout ] , is taken equal to : @xmath77 compatible with cr propagation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution with time of the cr spectrum at the position of the molecular cloud can be understood as follows . according to the model described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , crs with different energies leave the snr at different times .",
    "the highest energy ( @xmath78 ) crs leave the snr first , while crs with lower and lower energy are released at later times . moreover , higher energy crs diffuse faster , thus the spectrum of crs at the cloud exhibit a sharp low energy cutoff at an energy @xmath79 , which moves to lower and lower energies as time passes .",
    "the position of the cutoff represents the energy of the least energetic particles that had enough time to reach the cloud .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : crs ] it is clear that the influence of the presence of a nearby snr close to the cloud is reflected in the cr spectrum at the cloud position , but this influence depends on many parameters , such as the distance between the snr and the cloud , the time since the supernova explosion , and the cr energy .",
    "the crs coming from the snr dominate the total cr spectrum at high energy , while at lower ( @xmath7 gev ) energies the galactic cr background is always the dominant component , unless the molecular cloud is located at distances significantly smaller than @xmath80 50 pc from the snr .",
    "however , such small distances are comparable to the size of the snr itself and thus in this case an interaction between the snr shock and the molecular cloud is expected ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the investigation of this scenario goes beyond the scope of this paper and thus we limit ourselves to the case in which the distance between the snr and the cloud is significantly bigger than the size of both objects .",
    "aharonian and atoyan ( 1996 ) also evaluated the cr spectrum in the vicinity of a cr accelerator by using an approach similar to the one developed here .",
    "they made no specific assumption about the nature of the accelerators and solved the cr transport equation by assuming that a power law spectrum of crs is injected in the interstellar medium .",
    "they considered both the case of a continuous injection of particles during the whole lifetime of the accelerator and the case of an impulsive source that releases all the crs at the same time .",
    "the approach we adopt here is different , because it is specific for a given class of sources , namely snrs . in this specific case ,",
    "particles having different energies are released at different times in the interstellar medium .",
    "molecular clouds are characterized by a wide range of masses , going from @xmath81 to @xmath82 or even more and have typical sizes ranging from few to few tens of parsecs .",
    "the typical density of a cloud is of about few hundred atoms per cubic centimeter , but much higher densities can be found in less massive and smaller ( parsec or sub - parsec scale ) molecular cloud cores , dark clouds or bok globules ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the typical magnetic field of the intercloud medium is @xmath83 g @xcite , and it scales roughly as the square root of the gas density , thus reaching the mg level in the densest regions with density @xmath84  @xmath85 @xcite .    the propagation of high energy crs inside molecular clouds has been studied in gabici et al ( 2007 ) ( see also dogel and sharov , 1990 ) , where an extensive discussion can be found . here",
    "we summarize the most relevant aspects .",
    "once the crs from the snr reach the molecular cloud , they diffusively penetrate with typical time scale : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the cloud radius and @xmath88 is the diffusion coefficient which we assume here to depend on energy and on magnetic field as : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is a factor that takes into account deviations from the average galactic diffusion coefficient described by eq .",

    "since this is a quite high luminosity , only a small fraction of molecular clouds are expected to host such luminous ob associations ( williams and mckee 1997 ) .",

    "the cr electron flux inside the cloud is suppressed and we estimated the suppression by assuming that cr electrons can penetrate undisturbed the cloud only up to a given depth , which is estimated as @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the high and low energy end of the spectrum respectively .",
    "this approximation is satisfactory for the purposes of this paper , given that the suppression becomes crucial only for particles which emit negligible non - thermal emission .",

    "_ barometers _ has been discussed in several papers for both gev @xcite and tev gamma rays @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrated that snrs can provide enhancements in the cr density that can generate gamma ray fluxes well within the capabilities of currently operating instruments .",
    "the spectral shape in the gamma ray energy range deserves further discussion .",
    "for the situation considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmc2000 ] , the gev gamma rays are the result of the decay of neutral pions produced by background crs that penetrate the cloud .",
    "thus , the gamma ray spectrum above gev energies simply mimics the underlying cr spectrum , which is a steep power law of the form @xmath151 . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutral pion decay spectrum at tev energies is , in this case , dominated by the contribution from crs coming from the nearby snr .",
    "after 2000 years from the supernova explosion , only crs with energies above several tens of tev had enough time to leave the snr and reach the cloud and thus the cr spectrum at the cloud exhibits an abrupt low energy cutoff at that energy , that we call here @xmath152 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crs ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the gamma ray spectrum is expected to be peaked at an energy @xmath153 of several tev .",
    "the slope of the gamma ray spectrum below the peak is determined by the physics of the interaction only , and not by the shape of the underlying cr spectrum , and is roughly of the form @xmath154 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a loose association between a snr and a massive molecular clouds as the one studied here , is expected to be characterized , at least at some stage of the snr evolution , by a very peculiar spectrum which is steep at low ( gev ) energies and hard at high ( tev ) energies .",
    "the possibility of detecting sources with such a distinct spectrum is also relevant for the issue of identifying gev and tev unidentified sources .",
    "one of the criteria suggested to support an association between a gev and tev source is , beside the positional coincidence , the spectral compatibility . in a recent paper ,",
    "funk et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , investigated the spectral compatibility of egret and h.e.s.s .",
    "unidentified sources located in the inner galactic region . for sources showing positional coincidence , they found generally a good spectral compatibility , but due to the small number of sources , it was not possible to claim an association between the two populations of sources at a statistically significant level .",
    "for sources detected by only one of the two instruments , funk et al .",
    "( 2008 ) investigated the consequences of extrapolating the measured spectrumat higher or lower energies .",
    "they considered only single power laws extending over the whole ( gev  tev ) energy range and discussed the implications of adding a high or low energy cutoff .",
    "the scenario presented here adds the new interesting possibility of a single source showing a dramatically different behavior at gev and tev energies , namely a spectrum which shows a significant hardening at higher energies .    the evolution with time of the emission from the cloud is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmctot ] , where the solid , dotted , short  dashed and long  dashed lines show the spectrum at a time equal to 500 , 2000 , 8000 and 32000 years after the supernova explosion respectively . for comparison , the emission from a molecular cloud , with no snr located in its proximity , is plotted as a dot  dashed line . in this case , only background crs that penetrate the molecular cloud contribute to the emission .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : gmctot ] that the radio ( @xmath155 mm ) and the soft gamma ray ( @xmath156 mev @xmath157 gev ) emission from the cloud is constant in time .",
    "this reflects the fact that such emission is produced by background crs that enter the cloud .",
    "the emission in the other energy bands is variable in time , being produced by the crs coming from the snr .",
    "the flux of this latter component changes with time as indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : crs ] .",
    "the two most prominent features in the variable emission are two peaks , in x and gamma ",
    "rays respectively .",
    "the peak observable at gamma ray energies is the result of the decay of neutral pions produced when crs of different energies coming from the snr reach the cloud at different times",
    ". the peak moves at lower and lower energies with time , reflecting the fact that crs with lower and lower energies progressively reach the cloud as time flows . at early times , the emission can extend up to @xmath7 100 tev ( solid line ) , revealing the presence of pev crs and thus indirectly the fact that the nearby snr is acting as a cr pevatron ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "moreover , the gamma ray emission in the tev range is enhanced with respect to the one expected from an isolated molecular cloud ( dashed  dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmctot ] ) for a period of several @xmath158 yr .",
    "this is much longer than the period during which snrs are effectively accelerating the multi - tev crs responsible for the tev emission , which lasts few thousands years .",
    "this is because the duration of the gamma ray emission from the cloud is determined by the time of propagation of crs from the snr to the cloud and not by the much shorter cr confinement time in the snr .",
    "therefore , the gamma ray emission from the cloud lasts much longer than the emission from the snr , making the detection of clouds more probable @xcite .",
    "the peak in the x - ray spectrum is due to synchrotron emission from secondary electrons produced in cr interactions in the cloud .",
    "the peak is moving to lower energies with time but , unlike the gamma ray peak , it is also becoming less and less pronounced .",
    "this fact can be understood with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig : timegmc ] ( left panel ) . after 500 yr from the supernova explosion ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmctot ] ) , pev crs from the snr reach the cloud and produce there secondary electrons with energy in the @xmath139 tev range .",
    "for these electrons , the synchrotron cooling time is comparable with the escaping time from the cloud .",
    "thus , they release a considerable fraction of their energy in form of x - ray synchrotron photons before leaving the cloud . as time passes , lower energies crs reach the cloud and secondary electrons with lower energies are produced .",
    "for these electrons the cooling time becomes progressively longer than the escape time and this explain the suppression of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the x - ray synchrotron emission is weaker than the tev emission for any time and for times @xmath159 yr the ratio between tev and kev emission can reach extreme values of a few tens or more .",
    "these values are observed from some of the unidentified tev sources such as hess j1616 - 508 @xcite and more in general unidentified tev sources are characterized by the absence of any clear counterpart at other wavelengths . due to this peculiar spectral properties ,",
    "such sources have been labeled as _ dark _ , since they seemed to emit gamma rays only .",
    "however , in the scenario presented in this paper , spectra showing a high tev / kev flux ratio can be produced very naturally if a cloud is illuminated by crs coming from a nearby snr .",
    "this suggestion is also supported by the fact that most of the unidentified tev sources are spatially extended , as molecular clouds are expected to be .    in the hard x - ray / soft gamma ray region of the spectrum ( from tens of kevs to hundreds of mevs ) , partially covered by the integral satellite , extremely hard spectra ( @xmath160 ) may result due to the bremsstrahlung emission from primary and secondary cr electrons .    finally , the radio emission from the cloud is the result of the synchrotron emission of background cr electrons that penetrate the cloud . the contribution from secondary electrons is subdominant , due to the fact that the @xmath7 gev secondary electrons that might emit synchrotron radio waves escape from the cloud before losing energy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : timegmc ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the gev energy range , ionization and bremsstrahlung losses dominate , and this would further reduce the expected synchrotron emission . recently ,",
    "protheroe et al . (",
    "2008 ) estimated the expected synchrotron radio emission from secondary electrons produced by cr interactions in the sgr b2 giant molecular cloud .",
    "they did not consider the contribution from background cr electrons and neglected the effects of diffusive transport of secondary electrons ( namely , they assumed no penetration of electrons from outside the cloud and instantaneous cooling of secondary electrons produced inside the cloud ) .",
    "these assumptions are valid for the very strong magnetic field of the order of one milligauss measured for sgrb2 .",
    "such field is much stronger than the one assumed here .",
    "thus , due to these somewhat extreme assumptions , possibly justified in the particular case of sgr  b2 cloud , a direct comparison between their findings and the results presented in this paper is not straightforward .",
    "protheroe et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also noticed that the radio emission from a cloud at frequencies above @xmath42 ghz can be dominated by free ",
    "free thermal emission .",
    "being focused on the non - thermal emission from clouds , we did not attempt here to model their thermal emision .",
    "however , our findings can still be tested and constrained by observations in the ghz range .",
    "this can be done by requiring the predicted synchrotron emission not to overproduce the observed free ",
    "free thermal emission .",
    "a similar approach has been adopted by jones et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "as noticed in the previous section , concave gamma ray spectra may be produced in a molecular cloud located in proximity of a snr , as the result of the decay of neutral pions produced in cr interactions .",
    "such concavity reflects the shape of the underlying cr spectrum , which consist of the superposition of two components : the galactic cr background , characterized by a steep spectrum , and the crs coming from the nearby snr , which exhibit a hard spectrum . with this respect ,",
    "the distance between the snr and the molecular cloud @xmath6 plays a crucial role .",
    "this is because , the larger the distance between the snr and the cloud , the lower the level of the cr flux coming from the snr .",
    "moreover , also the time evolution of the emission from a cloud changes with @xmath6 since the time it takes a particle with given energy to cover such a distance scales as @xmath161 , where @xmath88 is the diffusion coefficient .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vshaped ] the total gamma ray spectrum from a molecular cloud is shown as a function of the distance between the snr and the cloud .",
    "the cloud mass is @xmath82 and the distance from the snr is 50 , 100 and 200 pc for the left , central and right panel , respectively .",
    "similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : gmctot ] , the solid , dotted , short - dashed and long - dashed lines refer to the emission for 500 , 2000 , 8000 and 32000 years after the supernova explosion .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : vshaped ] that a great variety of gamma ray spectra can be produced . in almost the entirety of the cases considered ,",
    "the gamma ray emission is characterized by the presence of two pronounced peaks .",
    "the low energy peak , located in the gev domain is steady in time and it is the result of the decay of neutral pions produced in hadronic interactions of background crs in the dense intercloud gas .",
    "the high energy peak is the result of hadronic interactions of crs coming from the nearby snr , and thus it is moving in time to lower and lower energies ( see previous section for a discussion ) .",
    "both the relative intensity and position of the two peaks depend on the distance between the snr and the cloud .",
    "interestingly , the gev emission from the cloud is affected by the presence of the nearby snr only at late times after the explosion and only if the distance from the snr is comparable or smaller than @xmath80 50 pc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vshaped ] , left panel ) .",
    "in all the other cases the gev emission is always the result of the interactions of background crs and thus , at least in this case , observations of molecular clouds in the gev gamma ray domain can not be used to infer the presence of a cr accelerator located at a distance greater that @xmath80 50 pc from the cloud .",
    "similar concave or `` v  shaped '' spectra have been recently obtained by rodriguez marrero et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in a different context in which two molecular clouds are assumed to be located in the proximity of a cr accelerator .",
    "if the two clouds happen to be located at different distances from the cr accelerator but within an angular separation smaller than the fermi angular resolution , then they would appear as a single gev source , and the superposition of their emission might result in concave spectra .",
    "however , rodriguez marrero et al . ( 2008 ) did not include in their calculations the contribution to the emission coming from the ubiquitous galactic cr background , which in most cases dominates over the contribution of crs from the nearby snr , at least for what concerns the gev emission from the cloud ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : vshaped ] ) .",
    "moreover , they also considered very short distances between the cloud and the cr accelerator ( down to 5 pc ) , but in this case an accurate modeling of the cr accelerator itself is needed , especially for what concerns its own gamma ray emission that might add up to the total emission .",
    "in addition to that , distances as short as @xmath162  pc are , under many circumstances , smaller than both the source size and the radius of the molecular cloud itself , and this changes significantly the problem since the interactions between the accelerator and the mc are likely to play an important role .",
    "the prediction of v - shaped spectra that we make in this paper is more general than the one by rodriguez marrero et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , since it represents an intrinsic feature of a single molecular cloud which is located close to a cr source .",
    "the v - shaped gamma ray spectrum reflects the shape of the underlying cr spectrum which is the superposition of the steep spectrum of the background crs and the hard spectrum of crs coming from the nearby snr .",
    "the value of the magnetic field in the cloud is an important parameter since it regulates the synchrotron energy losses of high energy electrons , and the diffusive escape time of relativistic particles from the cloud .",
    "observations suggest that the value of the magnetic field in a molecular cloud scales with the square root of the gas density , reaching very high values ( 1 mg or more ) in the very dense sub - parsec scale cloud cores @xcite .",
    "however , dense cores constitute a very small fraction of the total volume of molecular clouds .",
    "since here we are interested in calculating the emission from the whole cloud , the relevant parameter is the volume averaged value of the cloud magnetic field .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the total magnetic energy in the cloud @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the cloud volume , does not exceed the total gravitational energy of the cloud @xmath165 .",
    "this leads to a maximum value of the average magnetic field of : @xmath166 g .",
    "this is in general agreement with observations , from which a value of @xmath83 g can be inferred for typical cloud densities of @xmath139  @xmath85 .",
    "however , since the dispersion around this mean value is considerable ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is worth to investigate how the non thermal emission from a molecular cloud depends on the actual value of the magnetic field .",
    "[ fig : bfield ] shows the broad band spectrum from a molecular cloud of mass @xmath82 , radius @xmath167  pc , density @xmath168  @xmath85 .",
    "the distance between the cloud and the snr is 50 pc . in the top and bottom panels",
    "is plotted the cloud emission after 500 and 2000 years from the supernova explosion , respectively .",
    "the solid line refers to a value of the magnetic field of 30 @xmath169 g , while the dashed line represents the emission for a smaller value of the field equal to 10 @xmath169 g .",
    "the cloud emission from radio frequencies up to the hard x - ray band strongly depends on the value of the magnetic field , while the gamma ray emission is unaffected , being the result of hadronic interactions of cr protons .",
    "the strong dependence of the radio and x - ray emission on the magnetic fields is evident , and this demonstrate that this effect has to be taken into account in multi wavelength studies of molecular clouds .",
    "the non thermal emission from a molecular cloud located in proximity of a snr is the result of the interactions of crs that penetrate the cloud .",
    "both crs in the galactic background and runaway crs from the snr contribute to the emission . in this paper , we calculated the expected non thermal emission from the molecular cloud as a function of several parameters , such as the time after the supernova explosion , the distance between snr and cloud , and the cloud magnetic field . in all the cases ,",
    "the gamma ray emission from the cloud is by far exceeding the energy output in other energy bands .",
    "the gamma ray emission from the cloud consists of two distinct components .",
    "the first one is due to the interactions of crs from the galactic background , which are characterized by a steep spectrum .",
    "this component is steady in time and peaks in the gev energy region .",
    "the second component is the result of the interactions of runaway crs that escape the snr and diffusively reach the cloud .",
    "the spectrum of these runaway crs is hard and variable in time and both this characteristics are reflected in the related gamma ray emission . in particular , this component is producing a second peak in the gamma ray spectrum which moves to lower and lower energies , reflecting the fact that high energy crs are released from the snr earlier and diffuse faster than low energy ones , and as a consequence they reach the cloud earlier .",
    "the superposition of these two components of the gamma ray emission may produce concave spectra , which are steep at low ( @xmath7 gev ) energies and hard at high ( @xmath7 tev ) energies .",
    "this peculiar spectra might be revealed by means of joint observations of fermi and ground based cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the detection of such emission would provide a strong hint for the presence of a cr accelerator in the neighbourhood of the molecular cloud .",
    "it has been suggested that some of the _ dark _ tev unidentified sources , with no obvious counterparts at any other wavelength , might be indeed associated with molecular clouds illuminated by crs from nearby accelerators such as snrs @xcite .",
    "we showed here that , in this scenario , the _ `` darkness '' _ of a source , often defined as the radio @xmath170 between the tev and x - ray observed flux , depends on several parameters such as the distance between the snr and the cloud , the time after the supernova explosion and the value of the magnetic field in the molecular cloud .",
