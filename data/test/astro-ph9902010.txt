    "fk comae berenices ( ) , with its extreme activity , is a key target to study in the solar - stellar connection context .",
    "it is a rapidly rotating and apparently single g5 ii giant , even though the spectral classification can go as late as g8  iii , due to the fast rotation rate and spectral oddities .",
    "this star has a rotational velocity of _ v  @xmath4  i _",
    "=  162.5  @xmath5  3.5  km  s@xmath6 and radial velocity -24  @xmath5  3  km  s@xmath6 ( huenemoerder et al .",
    "@xcite hereafter refered to as hrbn ) . the photometric and rotational period is 2.400 day ( jetsu et al .",
    "this gives a projected stellar radius of 7.7  @xmath5  0.2  r@xmath7 ( hrbn ) . as a member of the old disk aggregate ,",
    "its distance and mass are approximately known : d  @xmath8  200300  pc and m@xmath9  1.5  m@xmath7 ( eggen & iben @xcite ) .",
    "some spectral peculiarities of fk com were first observed by merrill ( @xcite ) . amongst the oddities present in the spectra of this star can be included a strong , broad and erratically variable h@xmath0  emission ( e.g. ramsey et al .",
    "@xcite ) , strong uv chromospheric emission lines reminiscent of those observed in rs cvn binaries ( bopp & stencel @xcite ) , a quasi - sinusoidal light curve ( holtzman & nations @xcite ) and high x - ray luminosity ( walter @xcite ) . some of these spectral characteristics led bopp & stencel ( @xcite ) to define a new class of variable stars with fk comae as the prototype .",
    "the fk comae - type variables were thus defined as rapidly rotating , single , g - k type giants with strong chromospheric and transition region emission .",
    "stars belonging to this class are extremely rare .",
    "the space density of these stars was estimated by collier ( @xcite ) as 2  @xmath1010@xmath11  pc@xmath12 , indicating , when compared with the space density of the rare hertzsprung - gap g giants , that the evolution through this part of the h - r diagram must be extremely rapid .",
    "typical values of rotation rate from g - type stars are @xmath13  10  km  s@xmath6 for single stars and 3050  km  s@xmath6 for stars in close binary systems .",
    "the extreme rotational velocity , near breakup , of fk comae raises interesting questions on the possible evolutionary status of this star .",
    "two scenarios were advanced to explain the observed rotational and activity characteristics : accretion from a very small unseen companion or product of the recent coalescence of a close binary system . based on radial velocity variations measurements , mccarthy & ramsey ( @xcite )",
    "proved the first hypothesis very unlikely , by imposing severe limits to the mass of this unseen companion .",
    "the currently accepted theoretical scenario is that fk comae - type stars are recently coalesced binary systems . according to webbink ( @xcite ) , w uma systems ,",
    "due to the thermal instabilities caused by the primary s departure from main - sequence , evolve into configurations that can only be stabilized by a big loss of angular momentum , coalescing into a single star in a way that is mostly independent of their evolution .",
    "the rapid rotation would arise from the angular momentum of the former binary and the activity level from a rotation - driven magnetic dynamo ( ramsey et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the descendents of these binaries would be indistinguishable from single stars .",
    "welty & ramsey ( @xcite ) presented evidence that conforms with such scenario , based on the analysis of the width and shape of the spectral lines .    in fk comae ,",
    "the most striking spectral feature is the h@xmath0  emission line .",
    "this line profile is extremely broad , asymmetric and presents variations on different time scales .",
    "the same characteristics are present in higher balmer lines , even though appearing less extreme due to the different optical thickness of the lines .",
    "the phase modulation in these lines indicates that the emitting extended material is corotating with the star .",
    "based on the h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 flux ratios , hrbn have proposed that the emission arises in structures similar to solar prominences .",
    "we present here a model of the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  line profiles for a quiet phase of the circumstellar environment , derived from a data set obtained in may 96 .",
    "the model includes a 3d gaussian spatial distribution of emitting matter , extending to several stellar radii , and an optically thick near - stellar shell of absorbing material .",
    "the data sets from may and june 97 represent a more active state , demanding a different modelling technique .",
    "the h@xmath1  line profiles present a complex structure that we model as the superposition of gaussian - shaped components .",
    "the same components were found to be present in the h@xmath0  line profiles , superposed on a more distributed `` bulk '' emission .",
    "we were able to track these components in the velocity vs phase diagram for approximately 3 rotational periods .",
    "a large flare event was detected in our may 97 data set , in the balmer and d3 lines , and we computed the corresponding energy budget .",
    "the multi - site continuous spectroscopy ( musicos ) project was developed with the aim of providing continuous spectroscopic coverage ( in a large wavelength range and with instruments as similar as possible ) for a wide range of stellar objects ( e.g. foing & catala @xcite ; foing et al .",
    "@xcite ; catala et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; huang et al .",
    "@xcite ) . following these orientations , the first fiber - fed echelle cross - dispersed musicos spectrograph was designed and built in meudon - paris observatory ( baudrand & bhm @xcite ) and a replica was built at the esa space science department in estec and adapted for the int .",
    "the esa - musicos spectrograph was installed at the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( int ) , at the _ observatorio del roque de los muchachos _ , la palma , spain .",
    "the commissioning campaign of this instrument took place from april 29th to may 6th .",
    "our first data set was obtained in this campaign .",
    "the resolving power achieved was @xmath14  35000 .",
    "the second data set was obtained in may  97 also at the int with the same instrument .",
    "the ccd detector used in both runs was a tektronix , 1024  @xmath10  1024 pixels , with a readout noise of @xmath8  5  e@xmath15 . to reduce the int data , we used the midas nov .",
    "94 and nov .",
    "96 echelle reduction packages .",
    "the reduction procedure used was standard for echelle spectra , with some problems in the correction for the blaze function due to the low level of counts of the flat - field exposures in the bluer part of the spectra .",
    "in addition to these int observations , we obtained in june  97 more h@xmath0  spectra at the _ observatoire de haute provence _",
    "( ohp ) , in france .",
    "we used the aurlie spectrograph at the 1.52  m coud telescope , with resolving power of 30000 .",
    "the reduction of this data set was done using the on - line reduction facilities available on site .    in table",
    "1 we give the summary information on all the spectra obtained . the ephemeris used for the phase computations is from chugainov ( @xcite ) : 2442192.345  +  2.400e .    .list of 1996 and 1997 fk comae observations [ cols=\"^,<,^,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  2 we give the parameters for each of the gaussian components fitted to the balmer line profiles , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ vel_all ] , we show several plots that describe their behaviour : from top to bottom , the peak intensity vs velocity , and velocity vs phase for both lines . in order to highlight their phase behaviour",
    ", we also plotted ( in the two lower graphs ) relevant velocity curves .",
    "figure  [ vel_time ] shows the velocity evolution of the components in time . we have estimated a maximum error in the velocity determinations of about 50  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the plots for these two balmer lines were analysed together in order to clarify the structures position and evolution .      as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vel_all ] , three structures could be followed in phase , corresponding to v@xmath16  =  245  @xmath17 , v@xmath18  =  285  @xmath19 and v@xmath20  =  487  @xmath19 , both in h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 .",
    "it was observed that most of the components were detected within approximately @xmath5  2  _ v  @xmath4  i _ from the rotational axis , in agreement with welty et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that placed the emitting material at @xmath21  2  _",
    "r@xmath22_.    similar component analysis was carried out with the h@xmath0  spectra obtained at the ohp in june  97 .",
    "two representative spectra were fitted and the velocity positions of the components were compared with what was obtained for may  97 . even though some profiles appear similar ( fig .",
    "[ all97 ] , for phase 1.971 and 16.974 ) , the previously fitted velocity curves do not seem to describe the phase behaviour now observed ( fig .",
    "[ vel_all ] middle graph ) .",
    "in particular , one can notice the appearance of a new component near - zero velocity at phase @xmath8  0.47 , compared with one month earlier .",
    "however , the poor phase coverage in june  97 makes a detailed comparison ambiguous .",
    "we also find an increase of h@xmath0 equivalent width of 2    in june  97 compared to the quiet level of may  97 , for the two phases shown .",
    "most of the components detected in h@xmath0  have their counterparts in h@xmath1 .",
    "still , some higher velocity h@xmath0  components are not seen in h@xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the better detection sensitivity in h@xmath0 as the signal - to - noise ratio in h@xmath1  is lower , but also to the presence of the `` bulk '' emission in h@xmath0  that extends to higher velocities ( as it was also seen in the quiet state in may  96 we modelled earlier ) .",
    "a slight mismatch can be observed in the velocity position of the components in both lines .",
    "intrinsic measurement uncertainties and physical phenomena combine to create this effect .",
    "the origin of the emission is obviously not in point sources , their vertical extent making difficult to determine the center of mass of the matter distribution , due to projection effects and emission gradients in the extended structures .",
    "this lack of exact agreement between the two lines is then justified given the simplified geometrical model adopted and the ignoring of radiative transfer effects .",
    "the d3 ( @xmath2 5876   ) line is very weak or absent in inactive stars spectra .",
    "the presence of this line in cool stars like fk com indicates the existence of non - radiative heating processes , since the line can not be excited at photospheric temperatures . in fk comae , this line has two components : an excess absorption and near - surface emission wings .",
    "a non - uniform shell of excited could explain this line profile , with the corona as source of ionizing radiation as it is observed in the sun and active stars .",
    "a similar multi - component study was made for the d3 line .",
    "all the spectra present an absorption at near - zero projected velocity , even though its strength is variable .",
    "emission wings were detected above the limb , confirming the existence of a slightly extended shell of excited .",
    "the variability observed in the spectra can represent a back - radiation of a nonuniform coronal emission onto the upper chromosphere .",
    "the modelling technique we used did not allow us to take advantage of the rotational phase information that might be present in the data set , due to the complexity of the profiles .",
    "a large flare event was detected in these two balmer lines and also in d3 .",
    "the flaring material seems to extend from the stellar surface up to at least 3 stellar radii .",
    "the two spectra where we detected an increase in the excess emission , what we call a pre - flare spectrum and a flare spectrum , ( respectively ut date 16.0 and 16.8 in fig .",
    "[ all97 ] ) are marked by `` _",
    "f _ '' in figs .",
    "[ vel_all ] and [ vel_time ] .",
    "if these spectra represent the same flaring structure viewed at different phases , we can predict a velocity curve allowing to identify the post - flare structures at later phases . such a velocity curve is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ vel_time ] , corresponding to _ v@xmath23 _  @xmath8  245 kms@xmath6 ( r  =  1.50",
    "_ r@xmath24  i _ ) and @xmath25  =  0.612 .",
    "at five other phase positions the same structure is identified .",
    "indeed , this structure was first detected on may 15.8 and it was still present on may 21.8 , when our run ended . when transiting in front of the stellar disk , near zero projected velocity , this structure ( extended vertically ) would have smaller projected dimension , and in the spectrum we should detect a narrow peaked component .",
    "this is in fact observed in the spectrum corresponding to ut date 19.8 in fig .",
    "[ components ] .",
    "this flare event detected in the balmer lines caused an increase in equivalent width of 7  @xmath5  1    in h@xmath0  and 1.2  @xmath50.2    in h@xmath1  ( fig .",
    "[ ew ] ) . in the case of",
    "the measurements were very difficult , the flare increase in equivalent width being the only variation detected above the errorbars . using the cousins - bessel magnitudes for fk com and assuming a distance of 215  pc ( hrbn ) some flare energetics were computed .",
    "the calculated energy released at flare maximum is 8  @xmath5  1  @xmath1010@xmath26  erg  s@xmath6 for h@xmath0  and 1.1  @xmath5  0.1  @xmath1010@xmath26  erg  s@xmath6 for h@xmath1 .",
    "the h@xmath0  to h@xmath1  flux ratio is about 7 , perhaps indicating much lower densities when compared with solar flares . again",
    "the interpretation of such global ratios is dubious in this type of analysis .",
    "the total energy released during the flare for h@xmath0  is 11  @xmath5  3  @xmath1010@xmath27  erg .",
    "the uncertainties in the intrinsic flare radiative losses for h@xmath0  come mainly from the choice of reference quiet spectrum and residual emission from active regions around the flare area . comparing this energy with the one reported on the giant h@xmath0  flare , @xmath8  4  @xmath1010@xmath28  erg ( foing et al .",
    "@xcite ) , this seems to be possibly the largest h@xmath0  flare reported on a cool star .",
    "what is also remarkable is the long duration of this flare event ( total equivalent flare duration approximately 2.5  @xmath5  0.5  @xmath1010@xmath29  s ) .",
    "the ratios of the continuum ubvri counterparts to h@xmath0 , for similar flare events , are reported to be from 120 ( avrett et al .",
    "@xcite ; machado et al .",
    "@xcite ; houdebine @xcite ) up to 340 ( foing et al .",
    "the continuum ubvri counterpart of the fk comae flare could therefore amount to losses of 1.3  @xmath1010@xmath30 erg ( for a flare ratio ubvri / h@xmath0  of 120 ) .",
    "this can be compared to total radiative budgets for the largest reported cool star flares , 1.2  @xmath1010@xmath31  erg on hr  1099 ( foing et al .",
    "@xcite ) or 1.8  @xmath1010@xmath30  erg on ( cutispoto et al .",
    "thus , we can speculate that we may have observed an exceptionally energetic flare , but we have no independent photometric measurements to quantify the continuum counterpart .",
    "an enhancement of emission was measured at pre - flare and flare maximum with equivalent width 0.08 and 0.19   respectively and at a velocity consistent with h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  components .",
    "it was not measurable during the gradual phase , and in particular not in the post - flare spectra of may  19.8 .",
    "this is similar with measurements in solar and red dwarf flares , which show a more impulsive behaviour of this line , while the balmer lines show enhancements both in impulsive and the gradual phase ( foing @xcite ) .",
    "it seems also that the d3 flare maximum was reached before the h@xmath0  flare maximum .",
    "the changes observed in the large flare component width might also be associated with large kinetics ( turbulence and flows ) related with the flare event ( foing @xcite , foing et al .",
    "once again , the analysis of the line profiles gives us abundant evidence on the complexity of the circumstellar environment of the peculiar giant star fk comae .      for the more complex structure of the 1997 profiles a different modelling technique",
    "is applied .",
    "we have successfully identified and described the phase behaviour of emission components .",
    "the h@xmath1  spectral line was described as the superposition of several ( gaussian ) emission components .",
    "the velocity vs phase diagram allows to trace the same emitting structures as they corotate with the star . in the case of h@xmath0 , the profile is interpreted as a quasi - stationary distributed `` bulk '' emission , to which discrete components , lasting several days , are superposed .",
    "the same components were detected in both balmer line profiles .",
    "a strong flare event was detected in these two balmer lines and also in d3 .",
    "the flaring material seems to extend from the stellar surface up to at least 3 stellar radii .",
    "the evolution of the flaring structure was described by a velocity curve corresponding to _ v@xmath23 _",
    "@xmath8  245 kms@xmath6 or r  =  1.50  _",
    "r@xmath24  i _ from the rotational axis .",
    "the total energy released during the flare in h@xmath0  is @xmath8  10@xmath3 erg , the largest h@xmath0  flare energy reported on a cool star .",
    "the data set of june  97 , as it presents longer time intervals continuously covered , provides some more information .",
    "short time - scale variations were observed , that can not be associated with rotational modulation .",
    "several variable features are visible ; they can be interpreted as emission bursts with a time scale of about 1 hour that can be related to the excitation and recombination of giant magnetic loop structures around the star ( oliveira et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the d3 line is always present in the spectra , with absorption and emission wings components , as a clear indicator of the activity in this star .",
    "an absorption near - zero projected velocity is always present with variable intensity .",
    "the profiles also present near - stellar emission wings , particularly enhanced during the described flare event .",
    "the need is clear for a multi - site continuous data set to disentangle the intrinsic variations from rotational modulation .",
    "we have organized such a campaign in february / march 1998 , involving the following telescopes / observatories : int ( with the esa - musicos spectrograph ) , telescope bernard lyot , france ( with the musicos spectropolarimeter ) , david dunlop observatory ( canada ) , russian special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) and mcdonald observatory .",
    "the phase coverage thus obtained represents a major improvement in the analysis of the circumstellar emission on fk comae .",
    "this will be reported in a subsequent paper ( oliveira et al . in preparation ) .",
