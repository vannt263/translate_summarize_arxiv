    "many well - known physical systems take the form of geodesic flow on a manifold . for instance , euler s equation can be though of as a geodesic flow in the space of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms ,  @xcite and free rigid body motion as geodesic flow in  @xmath0 . in both cases",
    ", the metric on the space corresponds to the kinetic energy norm .",
    "it is also known that the _ geodesic deviation equation _  @xcite describes the stability of such flows .",
    "for instance , a space of negative curvature will lead to divergence of trajectories , and hence to chaos if the space is compact . but compact spaces of strictly negative curvature are hard to come by in the real world , to say the least .",
    "if we expect the negative curvature to lead to chaotic geodesics , we are better off looking for spaces with non - sign - definite curvature , but such that the averaging of the curvature over trajectories leads to chaos ( _ i.e. _ , the negative curvature ` wins ' ) .    in this contribution",
    "we will discuss a system which is physically - motivated and leads to chaotic geodesics .",
    "this system is the flow of a shallow layer of ideal , irrotational fluid on a curved substrate .",
    "following rienstra  @xcite , we will show that , to leading order , the governing equation can be solved in terms of characteristics .",
    "moreover , the characteristics are geodesics on the curved substrate , possibly modified by gravity if it is present .    of course",
    ", the chaotic trajectories have a nasty tendency to cross and form caustics everywhere .",
    "hydrodynamically , caustics are usually manifested as hydraulic jumps or so - called ` mass tubes , '  @xcite visible as a thicker edge region of the fluid in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] ( top ) .",
    "edwards  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite have recently described these mass tubes using the theory of ` delta - shocks . '",
    "@xcite at this point , we are unable to apply this theory to our problem , which means that solutions become dubious after characteristics begin to cross . unfortunately ,",
    "since our characteristics are chaotic , they tend to cross a lot . nevertheless , we believe that studying the basic properties of this geodesic flow is worthwhile as a first stab at describing the transport properties of flows on curved substrates . in addition , the geodesic flow we present is an interesting mathematical system , with rich dynamics that deserve to be studied on their own .    having gotten these disclaimers out of the way , let us proceed with the analysis .",
    "we hall do this in stages . in section  [ sec : coords ] we introduce a curved non - orthogonal coordinate system to describe the substrate , singling out a direction normal to the substrate . in section  [ sec :",
    "dynamics ] we use this direction to expand our fluid equations and derive a shallow - layer form .",
    "we show that the resulting equation can be solved in terms of characteristics , which are geodesics on the two - dimensional curved substrate , modified by gravity . in section  [ sec : advection ] we look at specific numerical solutions for particle trajectories , and in section  [ sec : lyapunov ] we speculate on their chaotic nature .",
    "we offer some closing comments in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in our problem , fluid motion occurs over a curved substrate of arbitrary shape .",
    "the direction normal to the substrate is special in that it defines the direction in which the fluid layer is assumed ` shallow . '",
    "hence , it is convenient to locate a point  @xmath1 in the fluid as @xmath2 where  @xmath3 is the location of the substrate ,  @xmath4 is a unit vector normal to the substrate , and  @xmath5 is the perpendicular distance from  @xmath1 to the substrate .",
    "the coordinates  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 are substrate coordinates used to localise points on the substrate .",
    "for example , in section  [ sec : monge ] we will use the monge parametrisation ,  @xmath8 , where  @xmath9 gives the height of the substrate .    the tangent vectors to the substrate are @xmath10 where  @xmath11 .",
    "the coordinate vectors associated with the coordinate system are found from  , @xmath12 where greek indices only take the value  @xmath13 or  @xmath14 .",
    "note that the  @xmath15 are not necessarily orthogonal or normalised .",
    "we adopt the convention that quantities with a tilde are evaluated in the ` bulk ' ( away from the substrate ) , and thus depend on  @xmath5 , whilst those without the tilde are ` substrate ' quantities and do not depend on  @xmath5 .",
    "thus ,  @xmath16",
    ". the three - dimensional metric tensor  @xmath17 has components @xmath18 where @xmath19 the three - dimensional metric tensor is thus block - diagonal , and the  @xmath5 coordinate is unstretched compared to the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "it measures the true perpendicular distance from the substrate to a point in the fluid .",
    "given the substrate vectors  @xmath15 , it is easy to solve for the covectors  @xmath20 , which are such that",
    ". then the bulk covectors are @xmath21 to leading order in  @xmath5 . from",
    ", we find the inverse metrics , @xmath22 higher - order terms in  @xmath5 will not be needed .      for most applications in the literature of thin films and shallow layers ,",
    "orthonormal coordinates have been the coordinates of choice .",
    "this is because the main substrate shapes that have been treated are planes , cylinders , and spheres , where orthonormal coordinates are readily available . for a general substrate shape ,",
    "orthonormal coordinates are difficult to construct and require numerical integration .",
    "singularities ( umbilics ) also cause problems .",
    "@xcite for our application  flow down a curved substrate ",
    "the monge representation of a surface  @xcite is the most convenient .",
    "the monge representation is a glorified name for a parametrisation of the substrate by @xmath23 in three - dimensional cartesian space .",
    "following standard notation ,  @xcite we define    @xmath24    [ eq : mongeparams ]    the unnormalised , nonorthogonal tangents  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 are @xmath27 and their normalised cross product gives the normal to the substrate , @xmath28 the corresponding covectors are @xmath29 and  @xmath4 is its own covector .",
    "the metric tensor of the substrate and its inverse are    @xmath30    [ eq : gmonge ]    with determinant @xmath31 finally , we will need the christoffel symbols  @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 and in monge coordinates given by @xmath34 the christoffel symbols arise when taking covariant derivatives .",
    "@xcite note that in we used the usual convention that repeated indices are summed .",
    "we write the normalised gravity vector as @xmath35 so that the inclination angle  @xmath36 is zero for gravity pointing downwards , and for  @xmath37 positive  @xmath36 induces flow in the positive  @xmath6 direction .",
    "then we have the components @xmath38the specific parametrisation of the substrate introduced in this section will not be needed in the derivation of the equations of motion ( section  [ sec : dynamics ] ) , only in their solution .",
    "hence , a different parametrisation could be used if called for by the geometry of the substrate .",
    "for instance , flow down a curved filament is better parametrised by cylindrical coordinates , or if the substrate has overhangs ( making  @xmath9 multivalued ) coordinates based on arc length are preferable .",
    "now that we ve set up an appropriate coordinate system on our curved substrate , we need some dynamical equations of motion for the fluid .",
    "we assume an inviscid , irrotational fluid with a free surface at  @xmath39 , with slip boundary conditions at the substrate  @xmath40 .",
    "the pressure on the free surface is assumed constant ( zero ) .",
    "we also assume the flow is steady and irrotational , so that the the velocity can be written in terms of a scalar potential ,  @xmath41 .",
    "the equations satisfied by the fluid are then    @xmath42    where  @xmath43 is a constant , with boundary conditions    @xmath44    [ eq : bcs ]    in terms of our curvilinear coordinates , equation   becomes @xmath45      now we assume that the fluid layer is shallow , so that  @xmath5 is proportional to  @xmath46 . after replacing  @xmath5 by  @xmath47 , eq .",

    "we discuss the method of solution in the next section .",

    "[ fig : cylinder ] shows , the theory is not likely to be valid much beyond the point where characteristics cross , and viscosity also causes important corrections . another effect we ignored is the possibility that centrifugal forces can cause the fluid to spin out and detach from the substrate .",
