    "parametric wavelength conversion in general and harmonic generation in particular are among the most intensively studied phenomena in optics and photonics  @xcite . it was demonstrated that important advantages can be obtained by cascading several parametric processes  @xcite .",
    "for instance , since a wide range of materials provide stronger quadratic nonlinear response compared to cubic nonlinear response , the efficiency of the third harmonic generation ( thg ) can be strongly enhanced by utilising a cascaded process consisting of second harmonic generation ( shg ) and sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) , which mixes fundamental wave ( fw ) and second harmonic ( sh ) to generate the third harmonic ( th ) . the conversion efficiency in this regime is the highest when the phase - matching ( pm ) conditions for both shg and sfg are satisfied .",
    "doped graphene is an atomically thin tunable plasmonic material  @xcite , which can be incorporated into various components in nanoscale and microscale optics . in particular , graphene demonstrates strong optical nonlinearity , especially when utilised near the plasmon resonance  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of significant interest to establish a theoretical framework and explore the viability of cascaded nonlinear optical processes in graphene - enhanced wavelength conversion devices .    in this work",
    "we develop a theoretical model for cascaded third harmonic generation in graphene - based plasmonic waveguides .",
    "we show that engineering modal dispersion allows to simultaneously satisfy shg and sfg phase - matching for efficient cascaded thg , and offers 5 times increase of th output compared to direct non - cascaded thg .",
    "we consider a planar waveguiding system consisting of a graphene sheet placed over a doped semiconductor sandwiched between two dielectric layers , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of a doped semiconductor is described by the drude model with the plasma frequency comparable to the fermi energy in graphene .",
    "this geometry allows the coexistence of three plasmonic modes@xcite , which as we show below can be phase - matched , strongly increasing effective nonlinear optical interaction . in our model",
    "we assume that the nonlinear interaction of propagating plasmons is achieved due to the nonlinear response in graphene . in this work",
    "we focus only on nonlinear processes in the waveguide ; the way of linear in - coupling and out - coupling of light to and from such hybrid - graphene waveguides was studied elsewhere  @xcite .     above the doped semiconductor with permittivity @xmath0 and thickness",

    "the optical pump at the frequency @xmath5 ( red arrow ) is generating the second harmonic at the frequency @xmath6 ( green arrow ) and the third harmonic at the frequency @xmath7 ( blue arrow ) . ]",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the expressions for the nonlinear conductivities at fw , sh and th in graphene . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the shg and thg coupled - mode equations and the corresponding nonlinear optical coefficients , including direct and cascaded contributions to the th . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the phase - matching and present the results of a numerical simulation , showing that hybrid graphene - semiconductor waveguides can simultaneously phase - match these three interacting harmonics , increasing the total third - harmonic output by a factor of 5 compared to non - cascaded regime .",
    "first , to characterize the nonlinear response of a graphene layer , we methodologically derive expressions for nonlinear conductivities taking into account in - plane plasmon momentum , which results in nonzero quadratic conductivity and enables shg .",
    "to describe nonlinear properties of doped graphene , we employ a quasi - classical description based on the solution of the boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "it is applicable at low frequencies , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermi energy . in the collisionless limit",

    "here we consider the case of p - plasmons or tm - polarized incident wave with the tangential electric field component of the form @xmath16 ( and @xmath17 ) . in this section",
    ", we assume that a graphene monolayer is placed in the plane @xmath18 .",
    "we note that there is no component of magnetic field normal in respect to the graphene surface .",
    "because of the graphene nonlinearity , the field @xmath19 excites higher harmonics .",
    "we look for the distribution function in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi - dirac distribution ( step - like at low temperatures , @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the first , the second , and the third order oscillating corrections ( the superscripts are omitted below ) , respectively , whereas the tangential electric field is as follows @xmath26 the electric current density at @xmath5 is given by the first order correction to the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath27 where @xmath28 therefore , the first order current amplitude can be written as follows @xmath29 this is a known result  @xcite . in the local semiclassical limit , the linear conductivity of graphene can be reduced to the drude model , which only takes into account intraband processes  @xcite @xmath30 it can also be corrected to include relaxation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the relaxation rate .",

    "thus , considering frequency conversion with plasmons , the quadratic conductivity of graphene @xmath39 can be defined as follows @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the plasmon wavenumber supported by a waveguide at @xmath5 .",
    "next , the third order correction is defined as @xmath42 to obtain the contribution to the third harmonic current @xmath43 from the first term @xmath44 we expand this term as follows    @xmath45\\\\ & \\times e e_{\\omega } \\dfrac{\\partial } { \\partial p_x }   \\left [   \\dfrac{1}{2i\\omega } \\left   [ 1 + \\dfrac{v_{p_x } q}{\\omega } + \\left(\\dfrac{v_{p_x } q}{\\omega}\\right)^2 \\right ] e e_{\\omega }   \\dfrac{\\partial } { \\partial p_x }   \\left (   \\dfrac{1}{i\\omega } \\left   [ 1 + \\dfrac{v_{p_x } q}{\\omega } + \\left(\\dfrac{v_{p_x } q}{\\omega}\\right)^2 \\right ] e e_{\\omega } \\dfrac{p_x } { p } \\dfrac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial { p } } \\right )     \\right]\\ : .",

    "neglecting losses , the dispersion relation and p - polarized eigenmodes of a hybrid graphene - semiconductor waveguide were analysed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "similar to the approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , to describe the plasmon conversion due to the graphene nonlinearity , we derive equations for the modal envelopes .",
    "the frequency conversion can be modeled by coupled equations for the amplitudes of fw , sh and th plasmonic modes , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the conversion efficiency is small , we utilize the following magnetic field ansatz @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the transverse profiles of the modes . disregarding the influence of the generated modes on the pump , the coupled - mode equations can be written as follows    [ eq : cmt ] @xmath61z}\\ : , \\\\   & \\dfrac{d \\mathcal{a}_3 } { d z } + \\gamma_3 \\mathcal { a}_3   = \\bar{g}_2   \\mathcal{a}_1 \\mathcal{a}_2 e^{-i [   k^3_{\\text{sp}}(3\\omega )   -   k^2_{\\text{sp}}(2\\omega ) -   k^1_{\\text{sp}}(\\omega ) ] z } \\\\",

    "the conversion from the th to the sh can be neglected , because , as will be shown below , the th efficiency in this kind of graphene - semiconductor waveguides remains much smaller than the sh efficiency , @xmath64 .",
    "loss coefficients @xmath65 in eqs.([eq : cmt ] ) can be obtained perturbatively from the dispersion equation , introducing dissipative corrections , namely the linear frequency - dependent surface conductivity of graphene @xmath66 and the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a damping coefficient .",
    "the coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 in nonlinear sources can be derived from the equations for the energy flows in the corresponding modes as follows    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 are defined as @xmath75 dx   \\\\ & =   { \\mathop{\\mathrm{re}}\\nolimits}\\dfrac{c}{8 \\pi } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\left [ { e^{2,3}_x(x ) } { h^{2,3 * } _ y(x ) }   \\right ] dx   \\ : .",

    ". phase matching , another important parameter that defines the conversion between these harmonics , is discussed in the following section .",
    "next we show that three guided modes corresponding to fw , sh and th can be phase - matched , so that at some @xmath5 , dependent on the geometrical parameters ( separations between the layers , dielectric permittivity distribution and doping levels ) , they have almost equal effective indexes @xmath81 ( or , equivalently , @xmath82 ) . to calculate the dispersion and the mode profiles we use the transfer matrix method  @xcite .",

    "the permittivities of the dielectric layers shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] are chosen as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "for simplicity we do not take into account the dispersion in the dielectric layers . adding the dielectric dispersion will require adjusting the thicknesses of the dielectric layers to compensate for it .",
    "we choose the thickness of a semiconductor layer as @xmath88 nm , and the thickness of the dielectric layer between the semiconductor and graphene as @xmath89 nm .",
    "then for the fermi energy @xmath90 ev , plasma frequency @xmath91 , relaxation parameter @xmath92 ps and the damping coefficient @xmath93 , we obtain simultaneous phase - matching for fw , sh and th , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , for the fundamental wavelength in free space of @xmath94 @xmath95 m . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) we show the corresponding overlap between the fw , sh and the th modes .",
    "strong graphene nolinearity allows efficient nonlinear interaction even between the modes with moderate field confinement , which can be further improved by optimizing the waveguide parameters .",
    "remarkably , for different dielectric and semiconductor parameters , the th mode can be phase - matched in the backward direction , although in this paper we focus on the case when all three modes are phase - matched in the forward direction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we demonstrate the evolution of the interacting fw , sh and th plasmons . we choose a realistic pump intensity of 1 mw/@xmath96 on a graphene layer  @xcite .",
    "the resulting shg and thg conversion efficiencies and optimal conversion lengths are comparable to the previous works  @xcite .",
    "particularly , choosing @xmath97 dimension of @xmath98 cm and the pump poynting flux per unit length @xmath98 w / cm , the outcome energy flows @xmath99 reach @xmath100 and @xmath101 w / cm , respectively , at the distance of about @xmath102 @xmath95 m . we note that the direct contribution to thg governed by the term proportional to @xmath71 in eq.([eq : cmt]c ) is an order of magnitude smaller than the cascaded one . to show this explicitly , as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we plot the th intensity evolution calculated by formally setting @xmath103 .",
    "the difference is remarkable , because the plasmon wavevector can notably exceed that in free space , leading to the efficent shg process stimulating a cascaded conversion to the third harmonic plasmon .",
    "to conclude , in this work we have established the theoretical framework for the direct and the cascaded thg in graphene - semiconductor waveguides , including a detailed derivation of all coefficients in the coupled - mode equations based on the waveguide parameters .",
    "we have shown that these waveguides can support simultaneous phase - matching of fw , sh and th plasmon modes , and that the cascaded thg can be several times stronger than the direct thg .",
