    "anomalous diffusion in the form of lvy flights appears in many physical , chemical , biological , and financial systems  @xcite@xcite .",
    "lvy flights are stochastic processes characterized by the occurrence of extremely long jumps .",
    "the length of these jumps is distributed according to a lvy stable statistics with a power law tail and divergence of the second moment .",
    "this peculiar property strongly contradicts the ordinary brownian motion , for which all moments of the particle coordinate are finite .",
    "the presence of anomalous diffusion can be explained as a deviation of real statistics of fluctuations from gaussian law , that it has lead to the generalization of the central limit theorem by lvy and gnedenko  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the divergence of the variance of lvy flights poses some problems as regards to the physical meaning of these processes . however , recently the relevance of lvy motions appeared in many physical , natural and social complex systems .",
    "the lvy type statistics , in fact , is observed in various scientific areas . among many interesting examples",
    "we cite here the subrecoil laser cooling  @xcite@xcite , the diffusion by flows in porous media  @xcite , the fluctuations in plasmas  @xcite , the molecular collisions  @xcite , the spatial gazing patterns of bacteria  @xcite , the flights of an albatross  @xcite , the long paleoclimatic time series of the greenland ice core measurements  @xcite , and the financial time series  @xcite@xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of lvy processes was also observed in the motion of single ion in a one - dimensional optical lattice  @xcite and in the particle evolution along polymer chains  @xcite .",
    "the problem of the barrier crossing in a bistable potential , the particle escape from a metastable state , and the first passage time density have been analyzed , recently , for lvy flights  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the main focus in these papers is to understand how the barrier crossing behavior , according to the kramers law  @xcite , is modified by the presence of the lvy noise .",
    "lvy flights are a special class of markovian processes , therefore the powerful methods of the markovian analysis are in force in this case .",
    "we mean a possibility to investigate the stationary probability distributions of superdiffusion , the first passage time and the residence time characteristics , the spectral characteristics of stationary motion , etc .",
    "of course , this type of diffusion has a lot of peculiarities different from those observed in normal brownian motion .",
    "the main difference from ordinary diffusion consists in replacing the white gaussian noise source in the underlieing langevin equation with a lvy stable noise .",
    "in this paper we use functional approach to derive the fokker - planck equation , with fractional space derivative , directly from langevin equation with a lvy stable noise source . starting from this equation we find the exact stationary probability distribution ( spd ) of fast diffusion in symmetric smooth monostable potentials for the case of cauchy stable noise .",
    "specifically , we consider symmetric potential profiles @xmath0 ( with odd @xmath1 and even @xmath2 ) , describing the dynamics of overdamped anharmonic oscillator driven by lvy noise .",
    "we find that for lvy flights in steep potential well , with steepness greater or equal to four , the variance of the particle coordinate is finite .",
    "this gives rise to a confined superdiffused motion , characterized by a bimodal stationary probability density , as previously reported in refs .",
    "however , in previous ref .  @xcite the authors analyzed the properties of stationary probability distribution for nonlinear lvy oscillators and its bimodality as a function of the lvy index @xmath3 , by finding that it is more pronounced for @xmath4 ( cauchy stable noise ) and becomes the boltzmann stationary distribution in the limit of @xmath5 .",
    "here we analyze the spds as a function of a dimensionless parameter @xmath6 , which is the ratio between the noise intensity @xmath7 and the steepness of the potential profile @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the spds remain bimodal with increasing @xmath6 parameter , that is with decreasing the steepness @xmath8 of the potential profile , or by increasing the noise intensity @xmath7 .",
    "ditlevsen and yanovsky with co - authors for the first time obtained the fractional fokker - planck equation directly from langevin equation , by replacing the white gaussian noise with lvy stable noise  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "however , some attempts were undertaken before in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the theory of lvy processes is closely linked to that of infinitely divisible distributions  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , starting from this link , we have recently developed a more general approach , based on the theory of infinitely divisible distributions and functional analysis , to derive the generalized kolmogorov equation for arbitrary non - gaussian white noise source  @xcite .",
    "here we obtain the equation for probability distribution from langevin equation with lvy stable noise , by a different approach with respect to that reported in ref .",
