    "the dynamics and pattern formation of bacteria serve as paradigms in understanding many properties of multicellular interacting systems , such as collective behavior , self organization , evolution , and development @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of bacterial motility and aggregation depend on numerous biological and chemical parameters , which include light exposure , temperature , concentration of food or of other substances , and lead to the existence of many classes of cell motion .",
    "since a bacterium can not utilize electromagnetic or acoustic radiation to sense its environment , it must rely on physical contact and its motility may depend on the production , diffusion and degradation of a relevant set of sensed chemicals .",
    "these chemicals are called chemoattractants or chemorepellants if they attract or repel bacteria , respectively .",
    "examples of chemoattractants include food - sugars and amino acids - whereas antiobiotics , fatty acids or other noxious substances are chemorepellant .",
    "a prototype and well studied example of bacterial motility is the run and tumble mechanism used by _",
    "escherichia coli _ in liquid environments .",
    "the specialized structures allowing for cellular motion are known as flagellae , spinning helical tails which extend from the cellular membrane into the surrounding environment : counter - clockwise rotation of the flagellar motor leads to a one - directional run whereas clockwise rotation causes tumbling along a random direction . during its run ,",
    "e.coli _ cell periodically senses for chemosensitive substances , and , by comparing concentration levels in new and old environments , adjusts its motion and its likelihood to tumble in a new , randomly chosen , direction @xcite .",
    "if the cell is moving in the direction of increasing attractant , for instance , the probability of tumbling is lowered , so that the run time and ` mean free path ' length in this direction are increased .",
    "e.coli _ cell , thus , compares chemical concentrations at nearby points , so that its future motion is determined by a chemical gradient @xcite via the mechanism of _",
    "chemotaxis may occur in other non - acqueous systems , such as in colonies of the bacterium _ myxococcus xanthus _ or of the eukaryote _ dictyostelium discoideum _",
    "( slime - mould ) which crawl on agar plates @xcite .",
    "the exact regulatory mechanism leading to the surface gliding of these rod - like and slow moving organisms is yet unknown , and responses to external stimuli appear to be more complex than in enteric bacteria such as @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the cells undergo chemotaxis , but lack , or show very modest , responses to specific nutrient stimuli @xcite , suggesting that the chemotactic behavior is due mainly to self - generated signaling chemicals @xcite .",
    "the fact that cell density regulates typical reversal frequencies may be a consequence of one bacteria sensing the higher levels of signaling chemical in the presence of others @xcite .",
    "in particular , under starving conditions , the cells are driven by auto - released fibril trails to aggregate and form multicellular compounds called fruiting bodies .",
    "these compounds raise above the agar plate and eventually sporulate into new and more resistant organisms which are then released to the environment in search of new sources of nutrients .",
    "one major difference between these systems and enteric bacteria is that the chemoattractants embedded in or self - deposited on the agar plates are relatively immobile on the time scale of bacterial motility , whereas chemoattractant substances in acqueous environments have a finite diffusion constant .",
    "e.coli_ , the gliding cells can only sense what they come into immediate contact with , and since the chemosensitive substance diffuses slowly , large fibril concentration differences exist over the length of the cell .",
    "the gradient driving the chemotaxis mechanism is then determined between positions within a cell body length , as opposed to the large distances involved in enteric bacteria chemotaxis .",
    "another possible mechanism driving cellular motility is _",
    "chemokinesis_. here , changes in the direction of motion or in the cell velocity are determined locally , without recourse to the determination of concentration gradients .",
    "chemokinesis may be a function of temperature , substrate adhesion , salt concentration or substances affecting the internal metabolism of the cell , slowing or enhancing its motion or turning frequency @xcite .",
    "the observed patterns of movement of _ m. xanthus _ and of slime - mould suggest that the motility of these systems may be affected by self - induced chemokinesis as well as self - induced chemotaxis .",
    "_ m. xanthus _ move by shooting out and retracting pili from the ends of their prolate bodies @xcite . in nutritionally abundant environments or under conditions of high population density ,",
    "both cellular systems generate repulsive fibril trails , leading to cell dispersion and the colonization of new regions of the agar plate .",
    "the mechanism is hypothesized to be dictated by chemokinesis @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies into the collective dynamics of interacting motile bacteria , both of _ e. coli _ and _ m. xanthus _ type , include coarse - grained convective - diffusive transport type models @xcite and lattice - type simulations @xcite .",
    "these studies have considered the effects of interactions with concentration fields , modeling chemotaxis or chemokinesis or , as in ref.@xcite , both chemosensitive mechanisms .",
    "the continuum theories take into account turning rates , and changes in speed or direction of motion , however they generally ignore long time path history effects induced by the sensed chemicals . in these systems ,",
    "the bias to the motion arises from an external , fixed stimulus and not a dynamical one .",
    "similar studies - with a fixed external trail - have been presented in different contexts , such as the aggregation of ants due to chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "other authors @xcite have presented systems in which the fibril trail that dictates the motion of the cells is determined over an extended area and is not sensed locally .",
    "the aim of this paper is to model and disentangle the effects of _ self - generated _ chemotaxis and chemokinesis , acting individually or concurrently and under diverse attractrant and repulsive conditions .",
    "in contrast to many of the previous studies , the chemical trail of our systems will emerge from the motion of the bacterial cells and evolve with the cellular motion itself .",
    "observations of individual organism paths may be more revealing of cellular dynamics than multicellular ensembles , and we restrict our attention to the behavior of a single bacterium . even if isolated , the dynamics of this single cell will be affected by its self - secreted fibril trail , and the resulting pattern will be that of a self - interacting random walker . we shall try to understand cellular motion by developing , and analytically solving , the equations of motion for an isolated _ m. xanthus _ cell under a mean - field approximation , and by means of simple monte - carlo simulations , incorporating chemotaxis and chemokinesis to various degrees .",
    "the underlying assumption of this paper is that the chemosensitive material acts as a regulator of cell motion affecting only the frequency of direction reversal , via chemokinesis or chemotaxis .",
    "the speed of the bacterium is assumed constant in either direction and is controlled by inherent cellular bio - energetics .",
    "experimental single cell trajectories show that an isolated cell travels along its axis , occasionally veering off , and for the sake of simplicity , we will only consider one - dimensional dynamics . in order to validate our models",

    "competing effects arise when @xmath58 and @xmath118 are of opposite signs . for large negative values of @xmath118 , the effect of positive @xmath58 values",
    "is simply to shift the mean of the spreading peak towards the origin ( figures [ comp5 ] ) . for smaller negative values of @xmath118",
    "increasing @xmath58 tends to localize the distribution functions at the origin , until the traveling peak is washed out and a plateau region , typical of large positive @xmath58 values forms ( fig.[comp3 ] ) .",
    "finally , in the regime of @xmath203 and @xmath211 , the localizing tendency due to chemoattraction is offset by the chemokinesis - plateau tendency .",
    "unusual distribution function patterns may arise as in the case of @xmath212 or @xmath213 and @xmath214 or @xmath215 in fig.[comp1 ] .",
    "to analyze the statistics of the one dimensional dynamics of cell motion under chemotaxis and chemokinesis , we also implemented a stochastic simulation on a 1d lattice .",
    "we discretize space and time and assume the random walker cell to have finite length @xmath2 . at time @xmath15 , the single cell is positioned at the origin of a one dimensional track and there is no fibril substance present .",
    "fibril is constantly secreted by the cell and the dynamics of the particle position obeys :    @xmath216    where @xmath217 is the position of the center of the cell at time @xmath218 and @xmath219 indicates the direction it was traveling prior to time @xmath4 .",
    "the stochastic random variable @xmath220 is defined as :    @xmath221 + 1 & \\quad \\mbox{with prob . } \\,\\ , 1-\\gamma_t \\end{array }",
    "\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath222 is the probability for the cell to reverse its direction , before the time step at @xmath218 .",
    "the initial direction of motion is chosen so that @xmath223 is @xmath224 with equal probability .",
    "we simultaneously model chemotaxis and chemokinesis through the dependence of @xmath222 on the self secreted fibril concentration @xmath38 , as in the continuum case .",
    "discretizing equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ phint ] ) we obtain :    @xmath225    where @xmath226 is the amount of chemoattractant that has built up at location @xmath3 and @xmath227 is the total amount of chemoattractant sensed by the cell .",
    "both @xmath226 and @xmath227 naturally depend on the past trajectory of the cell , which we keep track of as the simulation proceeds .",
    "we let @xmath228 represent the probability of direction reversal based on chemokinesis alone derived from equation ( [ hill ] ) .",
    "this probability is then stretched towards 0 or 1 depending on the local normalized chemical gradient in chemotaxis , through the quantity @xmath229 .",

    "the total reversal probability is calculated as :    @xmath234.\\ ] ]    in fig.[compare ] we compare the results from the monte carlo simulations and the mean - field approximation of the previous section , for small times , for a typical case of chemokinesis and chemotaxis .",
    "we can now analyze results of the monte - carlo simulations for longer times than in the analytic case : @xmath235 . at these time scales ,",
    "the general trends found in the analytic case persist for most combinations of @xmath236 .",
    "the simulation results are summarized in a phase - diagram .",
    "positive values of @xmath58 and @xmath118 both cause attractiveness in the system and we expect suppressed spreading of the distribution function .",
    "negative values of @xmath58 and @xmath118 on the other hand cause repulsion and enhanced spreading . to quantify these effects , we compared the distribution function @xmath237 with a normalized gaussian , corresponding to the parameters @xmath238 .",
    "more specifically , we compare the integral of the reference gaussian at the curvature inflexion points to the integral of the probability distribution function between the same limits .",
    "if the integral of the pdf is less than that of the corresponding gaussian , the dynamics is classified as being suppressed .",
    "this definition is shown in fig.[phase](top ) .",
    "we explore the entire phase space @xmath58 and @xmath118 and find the crossover from one regime to the other .",
    "the enhanced or suppressed diffusive character of the pdf curves may evolve from that of the early time regime , but it is found that after @xmath239 simulation time steps the classification is stable . the phase diagram is shown in fig.[phase](bottom ) . for @xmath240 ,",
    "both kinesis and chemotaxis effects suppress the diffusivity of the trajectories . only for @xmath241",
    "can the spreading dynamics be enhanced . due to our choice of the functional forms of the effects ( eqs .",
    "[ hill ] and [ hopone ] ) , the dynamics are much more sensitive to @xmath118 that @xmath58 , nonetheless , the effects of kinesis induces an asymmetry in @xmath58 in the phase diagram .",
    "the curve approaches the limits @xmath242 asymptotically .",
    "in this paper we presented a mean field model and monte - carlo simulations for bacterial dynamics under the mechanisms of chemokinesis and chemotaxis acting concurrently .",
    "the bacterial motion is that of a one - dimensional self - interacting random walker . the fibril trail that governs the dynamics of the system is itself a dynamical quantity that depends on the past motion of the cells .",
    "we model the two mechanisms in terms of two characterizing parameters , @xmath118 and @xmath58 , which represent , respectively , the degree of chemotaxis and chemokinesis .",
    "the mean - field results agree with monte - carlo simulations in the limit of short times . for long times",
    "we find a phase - diagram in ( @xmath118 - @xmath58 ) space that separates enhanced or suppressed diffusion regimes .",
    "in contrast to the short - time numerics displayed in figs.[kin2]-[comp5 ] , which show pdfs indicative of enhanced diffusion for @xmath211 , the long time phase diagram exhibits suppressed diffusion provided @xmath118 is negative and @xmath243 is not too large .",
    "therefore , in the long - time limit , kinesis modeled by the logistic saturation , eq.([hill ] ) , results in suppressed diffusion in the absence of chemorepellent effects ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "we have investigated the effects of increased cooperativity in the biochemical signaling through the @xmath54 parameter . as can be seen from fig.[phase ] increased @xmath54 values",
    "do not significantly affect the phase - diagram curve .",
    "the model exhibits variations in shapes of the particle pdf .",
    "the characteristic pdf shapes depend on whether long or short time dynamics are considered .",
    "one of the possible applications of this work is for isolated a - motility ( adventurous ) myxobacteria cells whose dynamics is driven by self - secreted slime and does not require the presence of neighboring cells in direct contact @xcite .",
    "our analysis is restricted to a one - dimensional system .",
    "for a single cell constrained to move along a 1d agar track , the relevant parameters ( @xmath118 , @xmath58 and @xmath54 ) of our model can be tuned to identify the correct mechanism of motion .",
    "moreover , the motion of freely moving a - type myxobacteria cells is _ locally _ one - dimensional .",
    "our model does not account for contact interactions between cells , rather , cells interact indirectly via trails of self - secreted slime .",
    "this simplification enables us to study the details of the effects of the history - dependent fibril concentration .",
    "direct cell - cell signalling interactions on a 2d aggregating colony are known to lead to the formation of complex structures such as propagating rippling waves and spiraling fruiting bodies @xcite .",
    "although the investigation of contact interactions between cells is beyond the scope of this paper , our approach does not preclude the formation of propagating waves and associated rippling patterns in systems where fibril - mediated cell - cell interactions are included .",
