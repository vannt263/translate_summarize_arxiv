    "various nuclear excitation modes have been understood by considering the symmetry of nuclear mean field and relative orientation of the total angular momentum with respect to its principal axes .",
    "in particular , the investigation of generation of high angular momentum states in nuclei based on symmetry consideration and geometrical models has been extremely successful in case of novel excitation modes like magnetic , anti - magnetic and chiral rotations @xcite .",
    "studies of high spin states in ag , cd and in near @xmath5 isotopes continue to reveal new aspects of these modes of excitations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "magnetic rotational ( mr ) bands were reported in @xmath6 in isotopes @xcite and recently , two dipole bands observed in @xmath7 in isotope were explained in terms of different k values with same quasiparticle orbitals @xcite .",
    "the nuclei in this region exhibit many exciting features involving regular band structures arising from the occupancy of the valance protons and neutrons in g@xmath8 and h@xmath9 orbitals , respectively . such high-@xmath10 orbitals are now well known for generation of rotation like sequences of m1 transitions called shears bands @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of nuclei in this mass region is the appearance of @xmath11 doublet bands @xcite with same parity , which are nearly degenerate . in this picture , the degenerate bands observed in the lab - frame arise in nuclei due to the possibility of forming mutually perpendicular coupling of three angular momenta of the collective triaxial core , valence neutron and proton either in left or right handed system in the intrinsic frame of the nucleus .",
    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations have been reported for the odd - odd nuclides in the @xmath12 mass region @xcite .",
    "favorable @xmath13 deformation required for chirality has been predicted in @xmath14rh , @xmath15ag , and @xmath0 in odd - odd isotopes .",
    "these triaxial doubly odd isotopes are predicted to have multiple chiral bands .",
    "recently , @xmath0 in has attracted considerable experimental attention and an elaborate level scheme of @xmath0 in has been reported in ref @xcite based on @xmath16li + @xmath17pd reaction .",
    "one of the motivation of the present work is to assign the parity of different dipole bands through polarization measurements for detailed understanding of their configurations .",
    "in addition , a heavier ion beam was chosen to populate excited levels of @xmath0 in with higher recoil velocity required for lifetime measurements using doppler - shift attenuation method ( dsam ) .",
    "the results of polarization and lifetime measurements have been used along with tilted axis cranking ( tac ) calculations @xcite to obtain the shape parameters and quasiparticle configurations for different bands in @xmath0 in .",

    "the data were acquired when at least three clover detectors fired simultaneously . @xmath21ba and",
    "@xmath22eu radioactive sources were used for the energy calibration and determination of relative photopeak efficiency of the array .",
    "after gain matching of individual crystals , add - back spectra were generated for all the clovers and the coincidence data was stored in the @xmath23 matrix which has about @xmath24 events in total .",

    "the line shapes of these transition were obtained by putting gate on 178-kev transition .",
    "assuming 100@xmath30 side feeding into the top of band , an effective lifetime of the top - most state was estimated which was then used as an input parameter to extract the lifetimes of lower states in the cascade . the side feeding into each level of the band",

    "the energies of @xmath13-rays and side - feeding intensities were used as input parameters for the line shape analysis .",
    "side - feeding intensities were calculated by using an asymmetric @xmath13-@xmath13 matrix comprising @xmath13-rays detected by detectors at 90@xmath31 along one axis and all other detectors along the second axis . once the @xmath32 minimization was obtained by minuit@xcite program ,",
    "the background and the contaminant peak parameters were fixed and the procedure was followed for the next lower level . after obtaining @xmath32 minimization for each level , a global fit was carried out , with the background and the contaminant peak parameters of all the levels kept fixed .",
    "the side feeding lifetimes were found to be faster than the level lifetimes similar to the measurements reported in nearby nuclei in this mass region @xcite .",
    "the final values of lifetimes were obtained by taking weighted averages of the results obtained from the two separate fits which were performed at 32@xmath31 and 148@xmath31 . for each band , b(__m__1 ) values were calculated from measured lifetimes using the following relationship :    @xmath33}}\\left [ { \\mu _ n^2 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , e@xmath34 is transition energy in mev , @xmath35 is partial lifetime of the transition deduced from fitted line shape of the state and @xmath36 is total internal conversion coefficient of the transition , respectively .",

    "it is evident that the b(m1 ) strength decreases with increasing spin up to @xmath40 in an identical way for all three dipole bands , which confirms the similar configuration for the positive parity dipole band of @xmath0 in .",
    "in addition , it is to be noted that the band crossing near @xmath41 mev observed in these positive parity dipole bands of @xmath6 in is not seen in @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "very recently , a positive parity dipole band with band head spin of @xmath42 has been assigned the same configuration @xmath39 in @xmath43 in @xcite .",

    "the experimental data of the dipole bands ( labeled as a and c ) are compared with the results of tac model calculations .",
    "the values of proton pairing gap parameter @xmath44 mev and neutron pairing gap parameter @xmath45 mev were used in the tac calculations .",
    "these values are 0.6 and 0.8 times the odd and even mass difference , respectively . the chemical potentials @xmath46 ( both proton and neutron ) were chosen so that a particle number is conserved for z = 49 and n = 63 .",
    "the values of deformation parameter @xmath47 and @xmath13 were obtained by nilsson strutinsky s minimization procedure @xcite .",
    "the nature of band a , which is a @xmath11 positive - parity m1 band , was investigated .",
    "a quasi - particle configuration @xmath39 is used in tilted axis cranking calculations for the dipole band .",
    "similar , configurations have been assigned in lighter odd - odd in isotopes and supports magnetic rotations .",
    "a minimum is found at deformation of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the calculated @xmath50 and @xmath51 plots based on this global minima given in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] qualitatively explains the measured data .",
    "however , the overall decreasing trend of the experimental b(m1 ) values in the measured range of spin is better explained by the results of the tac calculations based on a staic deformation with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , the measured b(m1 ) value at lower spin ( @xmath54 ) is closer to the tac calculation based on this lower deformation .",
    "the static minima suggests almost a constant tilt angle around @xmath55 and a large b(m1)/b(e2 ) values which is in line with the non - observation of crossover e2 transitions in band a. the low deformation of these states indicates that the contribution from the core in angular momentum generation is negligible and the whole of the angular momentum generation along the band can be attributed to the shears mechanism .",
    "similar situation have been reported for @xmath56 in @xciteand @xmath57sn @xciteisotopes in the literature .",
    "moreover , the good agreement between the tac calculations with constant tilt angle and the measured variation of excitation energy and b(m1 ) values with spin for the positive parity band firmly establishes magnetic rotation for positive parity band a. this positive parity band under consideration is probably one of the ideal mr band due to very low deformation of 0.08 .",
    "however , the confirmation of the small deformation will require further investigation of the crossover e2 transitions and measurement of the b(e2 ) values .",
    "the band crossing observed at rotational frequency 0.6 mev for @xmath58 in is due to lowering of the energy of @xmath59 configuration at higher rotational frequency . due to increasing neutron number up to n = 63 for @xmath0 in , @xmath60 orbitals are not available near the neutron fermi surface for this configuration to be energetically favourable which explains the absence of band crossing for the band a.    a negative parity dipole band c studied in the present work has excitation energy of 3153 kev .",
    "the 194 - 297- 347 - 362 - 404 - 409 - 470-kev cascade extended the band c up to @xmath61 = @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 configuration has been used in tac for comparison of the band c which gives a minimum with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the calculated @xmath66 plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) explains the measured values",
    "resalable well .",
    "the measured b(m1 ) values at @xmath67 are also reproduced with the results of tac calculations .",
    "this confirms the quasi - particle configuration of band c. in future , it will be interesting to perform the recoil distance measurements ( rdm ) to determine the lifetime of lower states of band c for testing the prediction of higher b(m1 ) values at lower spin states .",
    "in summary , the polarization and lifetime measurements for the excited states of the previously established level scheme of @xmath0 in have been carried out . out of the three dipole bands observed in the present experiment , band a",
    "is found to have positive parity , while bands b and c have negative parity .",
    "the extracted b(m1 ) values from the measured lifetime of the excited states of band a has a decreasing trend with increasing spin .",
    "the tac calculations based on @xmath68 configuration reproduces the measured trend of b(m1 ) with increasing spin .",
    "this establishes the shear rotation in @xmath0 in for the positive parity dipole band .",
    "the tac calculations based on @xmath63 quasi - particle configurations have been compared with the measurements for band c. the fair agreement of tac calculations with the measurement suggests weak prolate deformation for the positive ( a ) and negative parity ( c ) dipole bands for @xmath0 in contrary to the triaxial deformation as predicted in the rmf calculation @xcite .",
    "further measurement of the crossover e2 transitions in band a would establish this band as an ideal example of mr band owing to its small deformation of 0.08 .",
