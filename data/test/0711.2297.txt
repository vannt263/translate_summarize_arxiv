    "after the well known leading paper by morris and thorne @xcite , considerable attention has been devoted to the study of traversable lorentzian wormholes @xcite .",
    "such kind of geometries would connect two regions of the same universe , or of two universes , by a traversable throat .",
    "if they actually exist , they would present some features of particular interest as , for example , the possibility of using them for time travel @xcite .",
    "however , the flare - out condition @xcite to be satisfied at the throat requires the presence of exotic matter , that is , matter which violates the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the amount of exotic matter necessary for the existence of a wormhole can be made infinitesimally small by suitably choosing the geometry .",
    "after this , special attention has been devoted to quantifying the amount of exotic matter @xcite ; in particular , this amount has been pointed as an indicator of the physical viability of a traversable wormhole @xcite . besides , for a wormhole to be considered traversable , the geometry must be such that the magnitude of tidal forces are admissible for an hypothetic traveller ; this has also been analyzed for most physically meaningful configurations studied in the literature .    of course",
    ", no unstable solution of the equations of gravitation could be of interest as a candidate for a traversable wormhole . thus , besides the characterization of static solutions , their stability under perturbations must always be explored . in particular , this has been thoroughly studied for the case of small perturbations preserving the symmetry of the original configuration . a class of wormholes for which poisson and visser @xcite developed a straightforward approach for analyzing",
    "this aspect are thin - shell ones , that is , wormholes which are mathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds to obtain a geodesically complete new manifold @xcite . in these wormhole configurations",
    "the exotic matter lies in a shell placed at the joining surface ; so the theoretical framework for dealing with them is the darmois ",
    "israel formalism , which leads to the lanczos equations , that is , the einstein s equations projected on the joining surface @xcite . once an equation of state for the exotic matter in the shell is provided , the solution of the lanczos equations gives the dynamical evolution of the wormhole .",
    "such a procedure has been subsequently followed to study the stability of more general spherically symmetric configurations ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    according to present day theoretical developments , a scenario in which the fundamental building blocks of nature are extended objects instead of point objects should be considered quite seriously . in particular ,",
    "1dimensional objects ( strings ) are the most popular candidate for such fundamental objects .",
    "the study of the gravitational effects of matter in the form of clouds of both cosmic and fundamental strings has then deserved considerable attention ; see for example refs .",
    "we are interested in the viability of wormholes ; so within this framework any reasonable configuration including more parameters and thus allowing for improving its features as : amount of exotic matter , pressure , traversability and stability , deserves to be analyzed . in the present work",
    "we start from the metric proposed in the leading paper by letelier @xcite to address the study of thin - shell wormholes associated to a string cloud ( and also a global monopole ; see below ) .",
    "we study in detail the amount of exotic matter required for the construction , the traversability and also the stability of the configuration under perturbations preserving the original symmetry .",
    "as we shall see , comparing with the schwarzschild case , the string cloud allows for more freedom in the choice of the configurations to be stable , and also allows to reduce the amount of exotic matter without increasing the pressure . because recently certain attention was devoted to exotic matter fulfilling the chaplygin gas equation of state , in appendix a we",
    "explicitly impose it on the shell matter to obtain its time evolution beyond a perturbative approach . in appendix b",
    "we discuss a possible extension of the analysis to a related geometry . throughout the paper we set units so that @xmath0 .",
    "the action of a string evolving in spacetime is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant characterizing each string , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are a timelike and a spacelike parameter , and @xmath5 is the determinant of the induced metric on the string world sheet : @xmath6 introducing the bivector @xmath7 with @xmath8 the two - dimensional levi ",
    "civita symbol , the lagrangian density @xmath9 can be put as @xmath10 with this notation , a cloud of strings is described by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the proper density of the cloud .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is gauge invariant , and is called the _ gauge invariant density _ of the cloud @xcite . in the case of a static spherically symmetric cloud , we have @xmath14 with @xmath15 a positive constant .",
    "the general solution to einstein s equations for a string cloud with spherical symmetry in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime , that is with density given by ( [ rho0 ] ) , takes the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 this metric represents the spacetime associated with a spherical mass @xmath18 centered at the origin of the system of coordinates , surrounded by a spherical cloud of strings . besides",
    ", it can also be understood as the metric associated to a global monopole , which increases the interest of starting from it to construct a wormhole ( for the details see refs .",
    "@xcite , and for a related work involving a traversable wormhole see ref .",
    "the event horizon of this metric is placed at @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath15 is less than unity we have that the cloud of strings enlarges the schwarzschild radius of the mass by the factor @xmath21 . when @xmath22 the metric represents a homogenous spacetime .",
    "the cloud of strings alone @xmath23 does not have horizon ; it only presents a naked singularity at @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "1 we show where the event horizon is located and how this changes with the parameter @xmath15 . when @xmath25 we recover the schwarzschild radius and for @xmath15 close to unity the event horizon radius tends to infinity",
    ".     is shown .",
    "we can see how the position of the event horizon changes when the parameter @xmath15 varies within the range @xmath26,height=377 ]      now we build a spherically symmetric thin - shell wormhole starting from the generic geometry ( [ 1 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "we take two copies of the string cloud spacetime and remove from each manifold the four - dimensional regions described by @xmath27 the resulting manifolds have boundaries given by the timelike hypersurfaces @xmath28 then we paste or identify these two timelike hypersurfaces to obtain a geodesically complete new manifold @xmath29 with a matter shell at the surface @xmath30 , where the throat of the wormhole is located . this manifold",
    "is constituted by two asymptotically _ locally _ flat regions connected by a traversable lorentzian wormhole .     and @xmath31 , for @xmath32 when @xmath25 .",
    "after the boundaries are identified we get a geodesically complete new manifold with a matter shell at @xmath30.,height=302 ]    to study this class of wormhole we use the standard darmois ",
    "israel formalism @xcite .",
    "the wormhole throat is placed at the surface @xmath33 .",
    "this is a synchronous timelike hypersurface .",
    "we can introduce coordinates @xmath34 in @xmath33 , with @xmath35 the proper time on the throat . in order to be able to perform a quite general analysis ( for example , to study the mechanical stability of the configuration ; see below ) , we allow the radius of the throat be a function of the proper time , @xmath36 .",
    "this is strictly right because the existence of a generalized birkhoff theorem for the string cloud @xcite ensures that the metric of the embedding remains the same independently of the motion of the throat , as long as the spherical symmetry is preserved .",
    "so , the boundary hypersurface reads : @xmath37 the second fundamental form ( extrinsic curvature ) at the two sides of the throat is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the unit normals ( @xmath40 ) to the surface @xmath33 in @xmath29 .",
    "defining the jump in the extrinsic curvature as @xmath41={k}^{+}_{il}-{k}^{-}_{il}$ ] and its trace as @xmath42)$ ] we obtain the so - called lanczos equations : @xmath43+{k}g_{il}=8\\pi{s_{il}}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the surface stress - energy tensor of the shell placed at the throat .",
    "the non vanishing components of the extrinsic curvature are : @xmath45 @xmath46 where the dot means derivation with respect to the proper time @xmath35 , and a prime stands for a derivative with respect to @xmath47 . then , from eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) we get a formal expression for the pressure @xmath48 and the energy density @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 , first and second derivatives of @xmath50 , and the function @xmath51 which depends on the parameters of the system @xmath52 : @xmath53 @xmath54 where the prime means derivation with respect to @xmath47 . as it was to be expected ,",
    "the energy density is negative , indicating the existence of exotic matter at the shell .",
    "we shall focus on this aspect of the wormhole in the next section .",
    "it is easy to see from eqs . (",
    "11 ) and ( 12 ) that the energy conservation equation is fulfilled : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the area of the wormhole throat . the first term in eq .",
    "( 13 ) represents the internal energy change of the shell and the second the work by internal forces of the shell .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the wormhole throat is governed by the lanczos equations and to close the system we must supply an equation of state @xmath57 that relates @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in section 4 we shall develop this point in a perturbative approach , while in the appendix we shall obtain the dynamical evolution of the throat for a particular equation of state .",
    "many authors ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) have proposed to quantify the amount of exotic matter as a way to characterize the viability of a traversable wormhole . here",
    "we shall analyze the energy conditions and evaluate the total amount of exotic matter for the wormholes built in section 2 , in the case of static configurations , i.e. , @xmath60 . in this case , the energy density and pressure are @xmath61 @xmath62 the _ weak energy condition _ ( wec )",
    "states that for any timelike vector @xmath63 it must be @xmath64 ; the wec also implies , by continuity , the _ null energy condition _",
    "( nec ) , which means that for any null vector @xmath65 it mus be @xmath66 @xcite . in an orthonormal basis",
    "the wec reads @xmath67 , @xmath68 , while the nec takes the form @xmath69 . in the case of the wormhole constructed in section 2",
    "we have that the radial pressure is zero , @xmath70 , and the energy density verifies @xmath71 , so that both energy conditions are violated .",
    "the transverse pressure is @xmath72 and the sign of @xmath73 is not fixed by this conditions , but it depends on the values of the parameters of the system .",
    "there have been several proposals for quantifying the amount of exotic matter in wormholes . in order to allow for an immediate comparison with the results of other works",
    ", we shall adopt the most usual choice , which is the integral over space including the pressure associated to the violation of the energy conditions : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the determinant of the metric tensor .",
    "the advantages of this quantifier , compared with others including other measures as @xmath76 or @xmath77 , have been carefully discussed in @xcite . besides",
    ", this choice is consistent with previous proposals for covariant conservation laws in general relativity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath78 with @xmath79 corresponding to each side of the shell . in our construction the shell does not exert radial pressure , and the energy density is located on the surface so the energy density can then be written as @xmath80 .",
    "this yields the following formula for the amount of exotic matter : @xmath81 replacing the explicit form of @xmath82 we obtain the exotic matter amount as a function of the parameters ( @xmath83 ) that characterize the configurations : @xmath84 the amount of exotic matter is thus always smaller than in the schwarzschild case @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "3 we show @xmath85 as a fuction of @xmath86 for different values of @xmath15 . note that for @xmath87 the amount @xmath88 becomes linear in @xmath89 : @xmath90 .    , for given values of the parameter @xmath15.,height=377 ]",
    "a natural question is which conditions allow to reduce @xmath91 . since @xmath92 and @xmath93 as @xmath94",
    ", we shall investige this limit more carefully . for @xmath95 near the event horizon @xmath96 , the transverse pressure and the surface density energy behave as @xmath97,\\ ] ] @xmath98,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 . then",
    ", when we take the limit @xmath94 the surface energy density goes to zero but the transerve pressure tends to infinity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar behaviour ) .",
    "we can also consider the case when the wormhole radius @xmath100 is fixed and fulfils @xmath101 , and the exotic matter amount is taken as a function of the parameter @xmath102 . in this case",
    "@xmath91 can be reduced by increasing the value of the parameter @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , while the energy density and the pressure remain under control ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) : in this limit we have @xmath103 where the second term is kept finite even if @xmath104 precisely because the condition @xmath101 implies @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , under these conditions the amount of exotic matter can be reduced without increasing the pressure , which constitutes a remarkable feature for a wormhole construction ( in the pure schwarzschild case and in the same limit @xmath101 , the amount @xmath88 can only be reduced by reducing @xmath100 , which leads to an increase of the pressure ) .",
    "this is shown in figs . 5 and 6 .      a possible way to define",
    "the traversability of a lorentzian wormhole is to compare the relative aceleration ( proportional to the tidal force ) between to parts of a traveller , with the magnitude of the earth surface gravity .",
    "we start from the expression of the four - velocity of a traveller falling towards the throat straight in the radial direction ( that is with zero angular momentum ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 is its energy at infinity ( basically its rest mass ) . then from the definition of the geodesic deviation we calculate the covariant relative acceleration between two parts of the traveller separated by a distance @xmath108 in the radial direction : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the proper time of the traveller . from this expression",
    "it can easily be shown that a choice of the parameters making the wormhole stable ( see the next section ) and also reducing the amount of exotic matter , can render it traversable .",
    "for example , this happens for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which for a length of order one meter give a tidal acceleration which is about earth surface gravity .",
    ", with @xmath113 , for given values of @xmath95.,height=302 ]    .,height=302 ]    .,height=302 ]",
    "a physically interesting wormhole geometry should last enough so that its traversability makes sense .",
    "thus the stability of a given wormhole configuration becomes a central aspect of its study .",
    "here we shall analyze the stability under small perturbations preserving the spherical symmetry of the configuration ; for this we shall proceed as poisson and visser in ref .",
    "@xcite . as we said ,",
    "the dynamical evolution is determined by eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , or by any of them and eq .",
    "( 13 ) , and to complete the system we must add an equation of state that relates @xmath58 with @xmath114 , i.e , @xmath57 . by introducing the explicit form of the metric in eq .",
    "( 11 ) we have @xmath115^{2}=a-1.\\ ] ] to obtain @xmath116 we first note that the energy conservation equation can be written as @xmath117 which can be integrated to give @xmath118 from eq .",
    "( 26 ) , if the equation of state @xmath57 is given , one can obtain @xmath116 .    following the procedure introduced by poisson and visser ,",
    "the analysis of the stability of the configuration can be reduced to the analogous problem of the stability of a particle in a one dimensional potential @xmath119 .",
    "this is easy to see if we write eq .",
    "( 24 ) as @xmath120 with @xmath121^{2}+1-a.\\ ] ] ( we can verify the procedure by setting @xmath25 and see that we recover the results of ref .",
    "so , to study the stability we expand up to second order the potential @xmath119 around the static solution @xmath95 ( for which @xmath122 ) . as we expect , for a stable configuration it is @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where the prime means a derivative with respect to @xmath125 .",
    "then , eq . ( 27 ) takes the following form : @xmath126.\\ ] ]    to compute the derivates it is convenient to define the parameter @xmath127 which for ordinary matter would represent the squared speed of sound : @xmath128 . for",
    "now , however , we simply considerer @xmath129 as a useful parameter related with the equation of state ( see below ) .",
    "then , we obtain the second derivative of the potencial for the metric ( 1 ) : @xmath130,\\ ] ] where @xmath131 .",
    "the wormhole is stable if and only if @xmath132 while for @xmath133 a radial perturbation grows ( at least until nonlinear regime is reached ) and the wormhole is unstable . because the function @xmath134 is always positive for @xmath135 , we only have to analyze the sign of the bracket in eq .",
    "( 31 ) for determining which are the values of the parameters @xmath136 that make the wormhole stable .",
    "then , after some simple manipulations , the stability conditions can be written as follows : @xmath137 , \\\\",
    "b_{0 } & <   3m/(1-a )   \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "\\mathrm{if }    & \\eta_{0 }   >   -[(1-a)^{2}-3m(1-a)/b_{0 } + 3m^{2}/b^{2}_{0 } ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to get a good insight of the stability regions , we draw the curve @xmath138 in the plane @xmath139 for different values of the parameter @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "we can identify the regions of stability as follows : in the case of @xmath25 , for @xmath140 the region of stability lies under the curve , but for @xmath141 the stability region is placed above the curve showed in fig . 7 ( we can also see that when @xmath25 we recover the results by poisson and visser ) . then , for values of @xmath142 the shape of the regions of stability remains the same of the case @xmath25 , but their locations are shifted as the event horizon changes with the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we find that when @xmath15 is increased , the regions of stability , though shifted away , become considerably enlarged .     is shown.,width=566,height=415 ]    we observe from these plots that the stability of the wormhole configuration demands that the parameter @xmath143 of the exotic matter at the shell is , when positive , greater than unity ( see , however , the same analysis for a related model in appendix b ) .",
    "it is clearly not easy to interprete @xmath144 as a kind of velocity of propagating waves at the shell .",
    "furthermore , from the regions of stability obtained , we conclude that traversable wormholes with radii @xmath145 could be stable , under perturbations that preserve the spherical symmetry , only if the parameter @xmath146 is negative .",
    "however , it was pointed out by visser and poisson that the interpretation of @xmath147 as the speed of sound would require an understanding of the microphysics of exotic matter , which is not available by now .",
    "we have built traversable thin - shell wormholes applying the cut and paste procedure to the geometry corresponding to a spherical cloud of strings .",
    "we have found that the amount of exotic matter which is restricted to the throat can be reduced by a suitable choice of the parameters .",
    "moreover , we have shown that for a fixed wormhole radius @xmath101 , there exists a range of values of the parameter @xmath15 such that , while the amount of exotic matter can be reduced , the transverse pressure and the surface energy density can be kept under control .",
    "we have also studied the stability of the configuration under perturbations preserving the spherical symmetry , and we have found that the stability regions though shifted away become enlarged when the parameter @xmath15 is increased . within the characterization of static configurations",
    ", we have considered the traversability of large wormholes by evaluating the tidal force ; we have found that it turns to be acceptable in the case of values of @xmath15 and @xmath100 such that the wormhole is stable . besides , in the appendix a ( see below ) we briefly study the dynamics of the shell beyond the perturbative approach by considering the particular case of the chaplygin equation of state for the shell matter .",
    "also , the features of a related wormhole configuration are discussed in the appendix b.",
    "the authors want to thank lvaro corvaln for useful comments on differential equations , and ernesto eiroa for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by universidad de buenos aires and conicet .",
    "as noted above , it can be proved that there exists a generalized birkhoff theorem for the string cloud , so the geometry exhibited in section 2 is the general solution for the case of spherical symmetry ; in particular , no gravitational waves are emitted .",
    "thus the time evolution can be obtained from eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) plus an equation of state relating the energy density and pressure of the exotic matter . here",
    ", we consider the special case of the chaplygin gas @xcite , i.e. a perfect fluid fulfilling @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a positive constant .",
    "a remarkable feature of the chaplygin gas model is that it has positive and bounded squared sound velocity : @xmath150 , which is not trivial for an exotic matter fluid .",
    "this model has been applied in cosmological models because it describes a smooth transition from a deccelerated expansion of the universe to the present epoch of cosmic acceleration and because it gives a unified macroscopic description of dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "it has been recently proposed for supporting a class of thin - shell wormholes in ref .",
    "@xcite .    ) and initial radius ( @xmath151 ) we show the relation between the ( scaled ) proper time @xmath152 and the wormhole radius in the case of the chaplygin equation of state . for large @xmath153 there is no sensible dependence with the parameter @xmath15 while in the case of small @xmath153 , the evolution exhibits some dependence with @xmath15 ; here we plot @xmath154 for @xmath155 . note the difference between the two plots in the scales of both axes.,width=585,height=264 ]    if we take the eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) and replace them in eq .",
    "( 34 ) , the equation for the wormhole radius @xmath125 can be written as : @xmath156 where we have defined dimensionless variables @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in order to solve eq .",
    "( 35 ) , we define the variable @xmath160 and multiply this equation by @xmath161 .",
    "so then , after integrating , we obtain a first order differential equation for the squared velocity : @xmath162 now , if we return to the variable @xmath153 , eq .",
    "( 36 ) can be put in the following integral form : @xmath163 the solution of this integral has a closed expression in terms of elliptic functions of first and third kind .",
    "the general solution is parametrized by @xmath15 , so for simplicity we just exhibit a plot of the solution for large @xmath153 and for small @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "of course , initial conditions are taken such that @xmath164 corresponds to an initial radius greater than the horizon radius of the original manifold . in the case of large @xmath153",
    ", this approximation leads to study the dynamical equation of an anti - oscillator and the solution does not exhibit a dependence with the parameter @xmath15 . in the case of small @xmath153 , the solution has a smooth dependence with @xmath15 , and here we have solved the differential equation by taylor expanding up to fourth order about the initial radius @xmath151 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "8 , a monotonic evolution is obtained .",
    "thus , differing from the results obtained with a linear equation of state ( section 4 ) , within this model no stable configurations would exist .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the results of @xcite , where it was shown that in the case of the chaplygin equation of state , stable configurations required a non vanishing charge or a cosmological constant , which , compared with the string cloud , represents a more considerable departure from the pure schwarzschild metric .",
    "an immediate extension of our analysis of sections 3 and 4 can be performed in the case of a perfect string fluid ( see @xcite and the first paper in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . such a model includes a non vanishing angular pressure such that the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid has the form @xmath165 . as a result of this , for @xmath166",

    "@xmath172 in the case of a perfect string fluid .",
    "four values of the parameter @xmath173 are considered .",
    "the stability regions are compared with those corresponding to the cloud of strings with @xmath111 ( gray line).,width=491,height=377 ]      because the calculations are analogous to those above , we omit the details and give the results for @xmath174 ( we want to restric exotic matter to the shell ) and for @xmath170 of order @xmath175 .",
    "we compare the stability regions and the amount of exotic matter with the case of the string cloud with @xmath111 . as can be seen from figs .",
    "9 and 10 , while certain values of @xmath173 allow to reduce the amount @xmath176 with respect to the string cloud case , the regions of stability for low values of @xmath173 are shifted towards the horizon and become smaller .",
    "however , lower values of the would be squared speed of sound become compatible with stability ; in particular , for large @xmath173 a numerical calculation shows that positive values of @xmath177 slightly smaller than unity are now possible .",
