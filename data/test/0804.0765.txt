    "low - energy nonperturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , especially at nonzero densities , can only be studied by approximate methods within the framework of various effective models .",
    "it is well known that light meson physics is described by four - fermion models , such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , which was successfully used to deal with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath0sb ) both in the vacuum and in hot / dense baryonic matter ( see , e.g. @xcite , as well as the reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to the effects of diquark condensation and color superconductivity ( csc ) .",
    "the first studies of the gap equations and the ginzburg - landau free energy for a system of relativistic fermions led to the conclusion that superconductive and color superconductive states may arise in baryonic matter @xcite ( see also the recent papers @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting phenomenon , the condensation of charged pions , which may appear in dense hadronic matter due to an asymmetry of its isospin composition , has been investigated in the framework of qcd - like effective models , including the njl model , as well @xcite .",
    "note that all these phenomena might be inherent to physics of compact stars , where rather strong magnetic as well as gravitational fields are present .",
    "therefore , investigations of the influence of an external ( chromo-)magnetic field on the properties of the d@xmath0sb phase transition @xcite , color superconductivity @xcite and pion condensation @xcite effects are quite appropriate . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that external fields significantly change the properties of the chiral and csc phase transitions . in several papers , in the framework of the njl model , the influence of a gravitational field on the d@xmath0sb due to the creation of a finite quark condensate",
    "@xmath1 has been investigated at zero values of temperature and chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "the study of the combined influence of curvature and temperature has been performed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration for a uniformly accelerated observer due to the thermalization effect of acceleration was studied in  @xcite at zero chemical potential .",
    "further investigations of the influence of the unruh temperature on the phase transitions in dense quark matter with a finite chemical potential , and especially on the restoration of the broken color symmetry in csc were made in @xcite .",
    "one of the widely used methods of accounting for gravitation is based on the expansion of the fermion propagator in powers of small curvature  @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the three - dimensional gross - neveu model in a spacetime with a weakly curved two - dimensional surface was investigated , using an effective potential at finite curvature and nonzero chemical potential . in paper  @xcite , this weak curvature expansion was used in considering the d@xmath0sb at non - vanishing temperature and chemical potential .",
    "it should , however , be mentioned that near the phase transition point , one can not consider the critical curvature @xmath3 to be small and therefore the weak curvature expansion method can not be applied . hence , in the region near the critical regime different nonperturbative methods or exact solutions with finite values of @xmath2 should be used .",
    "this kind of solution with consideration for the chemical potential and temperature in the gravitational background of a static einstein universe has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "there it was demonstrated that chiral symmetry is restored at large values of the space curvature .",
    "analogous studies of diquark condensation and the related color symmetry breaking under the influence of a gravitational field have been performed recently in the model of a static einstein universe in @xcite . recall that this model is widely discussed in literature either as a solution of the einstein equations with a given cosmological constant and a nonvanishing energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid as a source , or as an initial state in inflationary cosmology with a scalar field , and the cosmological constant as its vacuum energy ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the einstein universe and other suitably generalized compact curved spacetimes were extensively employed for studying the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . as is well known , one of the possible models for the expanding universe is the closed friedmann model . since the formation of quark condensates",
    "is expected to take place considerably faster than the expansion rate of the universe , its radius can be considered in our calculations as constant . in this sense , the chosen model of a static einstein universe",
    "can be considered as a simple cosmological model for a space with positive curvature . on the other hand , the same form of the metric",
    "does also hold for the interior of a ( collapsing ) spherically symmetric star , thereby admitting also a non - cosmological interpretation of the chosen model .    as was mentioned above , in quark matter there",
    "may arise another remarkable phenomenon , pion condensation .",
    "up to now little information about the properties of pion condensation in the presence of external fields has been obtained . in particular , there arises the interesting question , what influence gravitational fields can produce on pion condensation .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is just to give a detailed investigation of this issue .    in order to be able to consider the effects of gravitation on pion condensation in a rigorous nonperturbative way",
    ", we will investigate here the phase structure of isotopically asymmetric quark matter in the framework of an extended njl model with dynamical breaking of chiral and flavor symmetries in the static einstein universe .",
    "in particular , our calculations are performed in the most simple case , restricting ourselves , for simplicity , to the flavor @xmath4 group . by using the mean field approximation",
    ", we will then derive an analytical expression for the thermodynamic potential of the njl model that will enable us to calculate the chiral and pion condensates of quarks moving in a space with constant positive curvature . on this basis",
    ", we study , in particular , the phase portraits of the model . our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii , iii contain the nambu - jona - lasinio model in curved spacetime and the general formalism for the derivation of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "numerical calculations and conclusions are given in sections iv , v. finally , some estimates of the role of quantum fluctuations in the case of a closed universe are given in the appendix .",
    "suppose that dense , isotopically asymmetric quark matter ( in this case the densities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks are different ) in curved spacetime is described by an extended njl model with the following action : @xmath7 and the lagrangian @xmath8q+ g\\big [ ( \\bar qq)^2 + ( \\bar qi\\gamma^5\\vec\\tau q)^2\\big ] ,   \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quark field @xmath9 is a flavor doublet ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and color triplet ( @xmath12 ) as well as a four - component dirac spinor ( the summation in ( [ 2 ] ) over flavor , color and spinor indices is implied ) ; @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are pauli matrices . in 4-dimensional",

    "since the generator @xmath28 of the third component of isospin is equal to @xmath29 , the quantity @xmath30 in ( [ 2 ] ) is half the isospin chemical potential , @xmath31 .",
    "if the bare quark mass @xmath32 is equal to zero , then at @xmath33 , apart from the trivial color su(@xmath34 ) symmetry , the lagrangian ( [ 2 ] ) is invariant under the chiral group @xmath35 transformations .",
    "however , at @xmath36 this symmetry is reduced to the subgroup @xmath37 ( here and above the subscripts @xmath38 imply that the corresponding group acts only on the left , right handed spinors , respectively ) .",

    "it is clear that @xmath128 is an even function with respect to each of the transformations @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",

    "so , at @xmath138 two particular cases can be investigated on the basis of the tdp ( [ 195 ] ) .",
    "first , let us choose @xmath139 and @xmath138 , but @xmath46 .",

    "it is clear that the metric ( [ 17 ] ) never coincides with that of the flat minkowsky spacetime because these two spacetimes have different topologies .",

    "it should be noted that one more particular case , when @xmath141 , @xmath149 , but @xmath33 , can easily be reduced to the investigation of the one - flavored njl model at @xmath141 , @xmath149 in the einstein universe @xcite , and hence we shall not consider it here .",
    "first of all , in order to normalize the tdp , we should subtract a corresponding constant from it , such that @xmath150 .",

    "our aim is here to perform only a qualitative study of gravitational effects on the quark and pion condensates by investigating the respective phase portraits of the njl model .",
    "for this reason it is convenient to scale the thermodynamic potential and all relevant quantities like condensates , curvature , chemical potential and temperature by the cutoff @xmath153 . ]    for convenience , we shall multiply all dimensional quantities that enter the thermodynamic potential by the corresponding power of @xmath153 to make them dimensionless , i.e. , @xmath155 , and denote them using the same letters as before : @xmath156 . then the regularized thermodynamic potential is written as @xmath157 + \\ln\\big [ 1+e^{-\\beta e_l^{(-)}}\\big ] \\big\\}. \\label{198_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the following section , we shall perform a numerical calculation of the points of the global minimum of the finite regularized thermodynamic potential @xmath158 ( they should of course coincide with the minima of the potential @xmath159 ) , and with the use of them , consider quark matter phase transitions in the gravitational field of the einstein universe .",
    "in this section , on the basis of the thermodynamic potentials ( [ 197])-([198 ] ) , we will study numerically phase transitions in quark matter and consider only the case of nonzero isospin chemical potential @xmath137 , whereas the baryon chemical potential is set equal to zero , @xmath138 . in order to obtain the values of condensates , one should find the global minimum point ( gmp ) of the thermodynamic potentials over the variables @xmath160 , @xmath73 from the corresponding gap equations @xmath161 formally , there are four different expressions for the gmp : i ) @xmath162 , ii ) @xmath163 , iii ) @xmath164 , iv ) @xmath165 .",
    "the first two gmps correspond to the isotopically invariant phases of the model , whereas the gmps of the form iii ) and iv ) correspond to the phases , in which the ground state is no more @xmath40 invariant . in these phases",
    "the pion condensation phenomenon occurs . for simplicity , we take for the numerical calculations of the gmp the value of the coupling constant @xmath166 ( in our dimensionless choice of parameters ) .",
    "let us first consider phase transitions at zero temperature , @xmath139 and choose the current quark mass to be equal to zero , @xmath167 .",
    "the thermodynamic potential in this case is described by formula ( [ 197 ] ) .",
    "the detailed investigation of the gmp properties vs external parameters @xmath2 and @xmath30 results in the phase portrait shown in fig .",
    "[ pp1 ] . for the points of symmetric phase 1 ,",
    "the gmp is at @xmath168 and @xmath169 . in the phase 3 ,",
    "the minimum is at @xmath168 and @xmath170 , and this indicates that the isospin @xmath40 symmetry of the model is dynamically broken in this phase .",
    "we note that at the same time the chiral @xmath52 symmetry remains unbroken in this phase , since in the gmp we have @xmath168 , as it should be in the case of zero current quark mass , when @xmath170 .",
    "@xmath171    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ pp1 ] , the critical curve , which separates the phases 1 and 3 , has an oscillating character .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the discreteness of the fermion energy levels ( [ 190 ] ) in compact space . moreover , as it is clearly seen from the curves in [ cond23 ] , the pion condensate @xmath73 vs @xmath2 also oscillates in the phase 3 .",
    "this effect resembles the van alphen - de haas oscillations of different physical quantities in the magnetic field @xmath172 , where fermion levels are also discrete ( the landau levels ) @xcite ( see also @xcite , where a similar influence of a magnetic field on the oscillation behavior of the compton scattering and photoproduction cross - sections was demonstrated ) . indeed , the corresponding magnetic oscillations of the critical curve in the @xmath173-@xmath172 phase portrait of dense cold quark matter with four - fermion interactions were found in papers @xcite .",
    "there , the existence of the standard van alphen - de haas magnetic oscillations of some thermodynamical quantities , including magnetization , pressure and particle density of cold dense quark matter was also demonstrated .",
    "the behavior of the pion condensate @xmath73 as a function of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath30 and as a function of @xmath30 at fixed @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cond23 ] ( left and right pictures respectively ) .",
    "the phase portrait at finite current quark mass , @xmath45 , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ pp2 ] . in phase 2 the chiral symmetry",

    "one should note that the right picture resembles , except for these oscillations , the corresponding curve in @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) for the flat case .      using formula ( [ 198_1 ] ) for the thermodynamic potential , we can also study the influence of finite temperature on phase transitions . the phase portrait at @xmath180 and zero current quark mass , @xmath181 , is shown in fig .  [ pp3 ] in terms of @xmath182 .",
    "it is seen from this figure that growing temperature leads to a smoothing of oscillations of the phase curve .    for comparision , in fig .",
    "[ pp4 ] , the phase portraits in the @xmath183 and @xmath182 planes ( the latter now at another value of temperature @xmath184 ) are depicted .",
    "first of all , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ pp4 ] that the isospin symmetry is restored due to the vanishing of the pion condensate both at high temperature and high curvature .",
    "the similarity between these two plots leads to the conclusion that curvature and temperature effects play a similar role in the restoration of isospin symmetry .",
    "@xmath185    the phase portrait in fig .",
    "[ pp5 ] for @xmath186 corresponds to the case of flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "it looks very similar to the one obtained , for instance , in @xcite ( see upper panel of their corresponding fig .",
    "let us compare the phase portraits at zero ( fig .",
    "[ pp5 ] ) and finite curvature ( fig .",
    "[ pp4 ] , left picture ) . in the first case the pion condensation appears at arbitrary small nonzero values of the isospin chemical potential , while in the second case the isospin symmetry becomes dynamically broken only at some finite value of the chemical potential @xmath30 .",
    "this phenomenon may be explained by the existence of a gap in the quark spectrum ( [ 190 ] ) , which is proportional to the inverse radius of the einstein universe . in this case",
    "the effect of curvature is similar to the effect of a nonzero current quark mass ( for comparison see lower panel of fig . 12 in @xcite and our fig .",
    "[ pp4 ] ) .",
    "in the framework of an extended nambu  jona - lasinio model , we have studied the influence of a gravitational field on pion condensation in isotopically asymmetric quark matter at finite temperature and isospin chemical potential . as a particular model of a gravitational field configuration",
    "we have taken the static einstein universe .",
    "this particular choice enabled us to investigate phase transitions of the system with an exact consideration of the role of the gravitational field in the formation of the quark and pion condensates and thus to demonstrate its influence on the phase portraits .",
    "in particular , we have found that thermodynamic quantities such as quark and pion condensates as well as the corresponding phase boundaries ( critical curves ) oscillate as functions of curvature .",
    "this oscillating behavior is smoothed out with growing temperature .",
    "there exists also an interesting similarity between the behavior of phase portraits when considered as functions of curvature and as functions of finite temperature ( compare figs .",
    "moreover , we have shown that for massless quarks and for some values of @xmath2 the isospin symmetry becomes in curved spacetime dynamically broken only at some finite value of the chemical potential @xmath30 ( look at fig . 6 ( left picture ) for rather small values of @xmath129 ) .",
    "this is contrary to the case of flat spacetime , where the pion condensation appears at arbitrary small nonzero values of the isospin chemical potential ( see fig .",
    "this effect resembles the pion condensation but at nonzero bare quark mass and may be explained by the presence of a gap in the energy spectrum of quarks in the gravitational field .",
    "finally , let us add some remarks on the possible role of quantum fluctuations of the collective fields and finite size effects in our approach .",
    "in fact , since the volume of the space region modelled by the closed einstein universe adopted in this paper is limited , finite size effects could eventually change the character of phase transitions ( see e.g. discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "eventually , this might even lead to particular situations , where no phase transition can occur .",
    "however , as it is clear from physical considerations , the finite size in itself may not practically forbid the dynamical symmetry breaking , if the characteristic length of the region of space occupied by the system is much greater than the compton wavelength of the excitation responsible for tunneling and restoration of symmetry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that our results , obtained with the use of the mean field approximation in the framework of the njl model are consistent with corresponding estimates of the role of quantum fluctuations ( see appendix b ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we emphasize that the results of this paper are evidently only of a qualitative nature .",
    "they do not allow us to find an exact value of the critical radius , and hence , further studies with more realistic models of gravitational fields should be undertaken .",

    "in section [ eu ] we have introduced two operators , @xmath110 and @xmath97 , acting in the hilbert space @xmath187 of all quadratically integrable functions @xmath188 defined on the spacetime manifold of the einstein universe .",
    "now suppose that there is an abstract hilbert space @xmath189 of vectors @xmath190 .",
    "let @xmath191 and @xmath192 be the operators of the space and time coordinates , correspondingly , defined on @xmath193 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath194 be the complete set , or basis , of eigenvectors of @xmath191 and @xmath195 , i.e. @xmath196 , @xmath197 .",
    "the set @xmath198 is usualy called the coordinate basis in @xmath193 .",
    "obviously , the completeness and normalization conditions for the coordinate basis @xmath198 are valid : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the unit operator in @xmath193 and @xmath201 .",
    "due to ( [ b1 ] ) , it is possible to expand any vector @xmath202 in terms of the basis @xmath198 , namely @xmath203 .",
    "the quantity @xmath204 is called _",
    "@xmath24- ( or coordinate ) representation for the vector @xmath190_. identifying @xmath205 with @xmath188 , we see that the hilbert space @xmath187 of all quadratically integrable functions is simply the coordinate representation of the above introduced abstract hilbert space @xmath193 .",
    "furthermore , if in the hilbert space @xmath193 there is an arbitrary operator @xmath206 , then the matrix @xmath207 , whose matrix elements in the coordinate basis are just the quantities @xmath208 , is called the @xmath24- ( or coordinate ) representation of the operator @xmath206 .",
    "obviously , in order to define an operator @xmath206 in the abstract hilbert space @xmath193 , it is sufficient to define its matrix @xmath209 , which acts in the hilbert space @xmath187 of all quadratically integrable functions , in the coordinate basis .",
    "it is clear that tr@xmath210@xmath211 .",
    "now , let us consider in @xmath193 the two commuting operators @xmath212 and @xmath213 such that in the @xmath24-representation they look like @xmath214 and latexmath:[$\\hat{\\cal h}\\equiv \\langle x '    operators @xmath110 and @xmath97 have a common set of eigenfunctions @xmath112 defined in section [ eu ] , from which it follows that @xmath216 the eigenfunctions @xmath112 are the coordinates of the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath217 of the operators @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( recall , @xmath218 ) : @xmath219 ( clearly , @xmath220 and @xmath221 . )",
    "it follows from ( [ b4 ] ) that @xmath222 . using this relation in the normalization condition ( [ b3 ] ) and then integrating there over @xmath24 with the help of ( [ b1 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath223 which is the analogue of the normalization condition ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "it is possible to show that the completness condition for the basis @xmath224 follows from ( [ b5 ] ) : @xmath225 let us construct in @xmath193 the following operator @xmath226 which is diagonal in the basis ( [ b4 ] ) , i.e. each vector @xmath224 is its eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath227 ( [ 192 ] ) . in the coordinate representation",
    "its matrix @xmath228 coincides with the operator @xmath113 ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "so , @xmath229 where the last equality was obtained by employing the completeness relation ( [ b6 ] ) .",
    "now , by using in this formula the eigenvalue condition @xmath230 , the normalization condition ( [ b5 ] ) , and , finally , by performing in the obtained expression the integration and summation over primed indices , we have @xmath231 since in ( [ b9 ] ) the quantities @xmath232 and @xmath233@xmath234 ( the last relation is due to the notations accepted in formula ( [ 191 ] ) and below ) do not depend on the time coordinate , the expression ( [ b9 ] ) is proportional to the infinite time interval @xmath235 .",
    "the remaining @xmath98-integration in ( [ b9 ] ) gives simply unity due to the relation ( [ 191 ] ) .",
    "so we have @xmath236 , \\label{b10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fact that each eigenvalue @xmath237 is @xmath100-fold degenerated is taken into account and the notations from ( [ 190])-([192 ] ) are used . in a similar way it is possible to obtain the quantity",
    "tr@xmath120 : @xmath238 . \\label{b11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "it is well known that spontaneous symmetry breaking in low dimensional quantum field theories may become impossible due to strong quantum fluctuations of fields .",
    "the same is also true for systems that occupy a limited space volume .",
    "however , as it is clear from physical considerations , the finite size in itself may not practically forbid the spontaneous symmetry breaking , if the characteristic length of the region of space occupied by the system is much greater than the compton wavelength of the excitation responsible for tunneling and restoration of symmetry .",
    "( indeed , one may recall here well known physical phenomena such as the superfluidity of helium or superconductivity of metals that are observed in samples of finite volume ) .",
    "this idea has been discussed for some scalar field theories in the einstein universe for instance , in @xcite . in this appendix , we shall demonstrate that , under certain conditions , dynamical symmetry breaking in njl - type models is indeed possible in the closed einstein universe .",
    "in particular , we will show that , if the radius of the universe is large enough such that the fluctuations of quantum fields are comparatively small , the symmetry breaking obtained in the mean field approximation is not forbidden .    for illustrations ,",
    "let us confine to the analogous case of the chiral condensate and consider the simplified case of the linearized lagrangian ( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath239 , @xmath240 and the corresponding partition function @xmath241 with @xmath242 now , supposing that @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath160 and @xmath245 denotes its quantum fluctuation , we obtain : @xmath246 where @xmath247 . thus @xmath248 , where @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 is the effective potential at @xmath252 .",
    "the contribution of quantum fluctuations up to the @xmath253-term to the effective action @xmath254 is given by @xmath255 it is evident , that in the above expansion the term linear in @xmath245 corresponds to the so - called tadpole diagram with one external @xmath245-line and the term quadratic in @xmath245 corresponds to the `` polarization operator '' diagram of the @xmath245 field with one fermion loop . from ( [ v01 ] )",
    "we can write the stationarity condition and find the gap equation , @xmath256 , @xmath257 and the linear terms in @xmath245 , corresponding to the tadpole diagram , cancel out in @xmath258 .",
    "thus , the contribution of fluctuations to the field action is given by @xmath259 next , we shall calculate the contribution of fluctuations @xmath245 to the effective action , taking into account the quark loop in the gravitational field .",
    "( note that this corresponds to the integral ( 11 ) and fig.1a in @xcite . ) for our purpose of making estimates of the role of fluctuations , it is sufficient to limit ourselves to the consideration of fluctuations depending only on time . in this case , we can extract the necessary kinematical factor for the meson fluctuation field and then integrate over the time - component of the loop momentum in the limit of vanishing external momenta .",
    "finally , after going to the basis for the dirac equation in the einstein universe ( see ( [ 19])([191 ] ) ) we obtain a sum over fermion loop quantum numbers @xmath151 instead of an integration over momenta of free quarks made in @xcite .",
    "the sum is divergent and we regularize it by the cut off @xmath153 . in this way we obtain the effective action @xmath260 , \\label{phiaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath261 and @xmath262 are given in ( [ 190 ] ) .",
    "the summation over @xmath151 in the first term in parenthesis in the above equation cancels out by the term @xmath263 , due to the stationarity condition ( [ gap ] ) @xmath264 after this we obtain @xmath265 or @xmath266 with the lagrange function @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the space volume , and the renormalization @xmath269-factor is defined as @xmath270 for comparision , let us consider the limiting case of flat space which is reached by the replacements @xmath271 in ( [ major ] ) .",
    "then the @xmath269-factor takes the form of the integral in the euclidean spacetime @xmath272 with @xmath273 being the quark energy .",
    "this expression evidently corresponds to the similar formula for the @xmath274-factor in the flat space case considered in @xcite .",
    "next , let us perform the field renormalization @xmath275 in ( [ lagrange ] ) .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the boson field near the ground state @xmath244 can now be estimated , if we consider the renormalized expression ( [ lagrange ] ) as the lagrange function for a harmonic oscillator ( here , we follow the idea of @xcitemodel of a self - interacting scalar field was considered and the scalar loop contribution to the fluctuation lagrangian was calculated . ] ) with the mass @xmath32 and frequency @xmath276 , formally given here by the relations @xmath277 then we can estimate the quantum fluctuations as @xmath278 where m is the mass of the composite @xmath160-meson .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath279 the estimate ( [ estimate ] ) gives a criterion for the role of quantum fluctuations for a system with finite volume . clearly , quantum fluctuations can be considered negligible , if @xmath280 .",
    "this is in agreement with the physical requirement that quantum fluctuations should be negligible if @xmath281 , i.e. , if the radius of the universe is much greater than the compton wavelength @xmath282 of the @xmath160-meson ( quarks ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    ", which are of order @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "all these corrections are surely suppressed in the case of large numbers of colors @xmath284 , where the ( induced ) coupling constants become small . ]",
    "the above estimates are certainly of a qualitative nature , and hence they do not allow us to find an exact value of a critical radius such that symmetry breaking for lower values of the curvature radius of the einstein universe is forbidden .          m.k .",
