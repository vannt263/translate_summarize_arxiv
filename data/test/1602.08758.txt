    "the rapid development and improvement of ultra - intense laser pulses have opened new areas of physics for fundamental research and have also enabled novel technological applications .",
    "relativistically intense ( @xmath0 w/@xmath1 ) laser pulses readily ionize matter converting it into a plasma .",
    "the interaction with the plasma electrons is the primary channel for the energy transfer from the laser pulse , providing the basis for a wide range of phenomena and applications .",
    "specifically , generation of copious relativistic electrons is the key to x - ray  @xcite and secondary particle sources , such as energetic ions  @xcite , neutrons  @xcite , and positrons  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore critical to understand what controls the generation of relativistic electrons in relevant regimes of laser - plasma interactions .",
    "it is well recognized that the regime in which a relativistically intense laser pulse irradiates a sub - critical plasma is optimal for generating relativistic electrons .",
    "the pulse can propagate through such a plasma , which enables an extended interaction length with the electrons . in experiments aimed at x - ray generation ,",
    "this regime is deliberately achieved by using an expanding gas jet  @xcite .",
    "this regime can also naturally arise in experiments with solid density targets irradiated by a powerful laser pulse due to the presence of a prepulse  @xcite .",
    "the prepulse often delivers a considerable amount of energy , causing the front of the target to expand and form an extended subcritical preplasma prior to the arrival of the main pulse .    the important role played by the interaction of the main pulse with the preplasma in generating",
    "an energetic electron population in experiments with initially solid - density targets was however not immediately recognized .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that in some setups the role of the prepulse can also be detrimental .",
    "it is the case in experiments aimed at ion acceleration , where the pre - expansion at the surface of a thick bulk target caused by the prepulse significantly reduces the effectiveness of ion acceleration  @xcite .",
    "recently , the focus of the ion acceleration research has markedly shifted towards those regimes in which the target becomes transparent to the main relativistically intense pulse and the electron acceleration and heating can be fully utilized  @xcite .",
    "such a regime is achieved by employing an initially ultra - thin target that significantly expands during the pre - pulse and forms a relativistically transparent plasma extending many wavelengths along the direction of the laser beam propagation .",
    "the same regime has also been used to generate energetic electrons that are subsequently converted into a short neutron beam  @xcite .",
    "how energetic electrons are generated strongly depends on the duration of the main laser pulse . in most setups aimed at producing secondary particle sources , the laser pulse irradiates the plasma over a time period that is longer than the characteristic electron response time .",
    "this regime is the opposite to the regime used for the wakefield acceleration  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the laser pulse establishes a quasi - steady - state structure in the plasma that slowly evolves on an ion time scale  @xcite . by expelling some of the electrons radially ,",
    "the laser creates a positively charged elongated channel in the plasma with quasi - static transverse and longitudinal electric fields .",
    "new electrons are continuously injected into the channel , typically through the channel opening  @xcite , and then get accelerated and pushed forward by the laser pulse in the presence of the quasi - static fields .",
    "the described regime is often broadly referred to as the direct laser acceleration regime . in terms of applications",
    ", it is critical to know what controls the electron energy gain",
    ". early work on the topic  @xcite indicated that the transverse static electric field can be beneficial for enhancing the electron energy gain beyond what is expected from a single electron irradiated by a plane wave in a vacuum .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in the direct laser acceleration of electrons , as experimental groups shift their focus to regimes of relativistic transparency and also try to optimize the preplasma conditions using multiple laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "recent simulation results have also demonstrated that the direct laser acceleration can be important in the context of the laser wakefield acceleration  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the role played by transverse and longitudinal quasi - static electric fields present in a plasma channel in enhancing the electron energy gain from the laser pulse .",
    "we also address the role of electron injection into the laser beam and the limitations imposed by the super - luminosity of the laser field that is induced by the channel .",
    "this paper is based on a body of work performed by us over the last couple of years  @xcite and is designed to serve in part as an overview of some novel aspects of the direct laser acceleration . here",
    "we focus on illustrating the key qualitative concepts and phenomena , while providing references to those publications where one can find more detailed technical analysis .",
    "the nature of the laser - plasma interaction strongly depends on the amplitude of the irradiating laser pulse and on the electron density of the irradiated plasma .",
    "it is convenient to use a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 to quantify the impact of a laser pulse with electric field amplitude @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 on electron motion . here",
    "@xmath5 is the speed of light and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron charge and mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is often referred to as the normalized laser amplitude .",
    "it is roughly the ratio of the transverse electron momentum induced by the oscillating laser electric field to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , a laser pulse with a normalized amplitude of @xmath10 would induce relativistic electron motion .",
    "the electron density in the plasma determines whether the laser pulse can propagate into the plasma and accelerate plasma electrons .",
    "the cut - off for a pulse with @xmath11 occurs at a critical density , @xmath12 for which the electron plasma frequency @xmath13 becomes equal to the frequency of the laser pulse . at laser amplitudes @xmath10",
    ", the plasma can become relativistically transparent at electron densities exceeding the critical density @xmath14 .",
    "the adjusted critical density in this case depends on the amplitude of the irradiating laser pulse , because the effect is caused by the relativistic motion of electrons in the strong field of the laser .",
    "the optimal regime for generating copious relativistic electrons is then the regime in which a relativistic amplitude laser pulse @xmath15 irradiates an extended sub - critical plasma @xmath16 . in order to illustrate the key features of the laser - plasma interaction in this regime ,",
    "we have performed a two - dimensional ( 2d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation whose results are shown in fig .",

    "the ions were kept immobile in this simulation to distinguish more clearly the effect of the long laser pulse .",
    "detailed parameters of the simulation are given in appendix  [ appendix_1 ] .",
    "as the pulse enters the plasma , its ponderomotive force begins to expel some of the electrons out of the laser pulse in the transverse direction producing a channel .",
    "the un - neutralized ion charge generates a counteracting force that , in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_example ] , prevents the channel from becoming fully evacuated .",
    "the laser pulse produces and maintains a steady - state channel if the pulse duration exceeds the characteristic electron response time . the snapshot of the electron density in fig .",

    "the time - averaged electric fields are relatively small compared to the amplitude of the oscillating laser electric field that is also present in the channel .",
    "once the steady - state channel structure is established , new electrons are continuously injected into the channel through the opening .",
    "this is particularly clear from the snapshot of the time - averaged current density , whose absolute value is shown in the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_example ] .",
    "the injected electrons are accelerated and pushed forward by the laser pulse , producing a steady - state electron current in the channel .",
    "this current generates a quasi - static transverse magnetic field directed in and out of the plane of the simulation ( along the @xmath23-axis ) .",
    "the return current flowing outside of the channel causes for the magnetic field to be localized inside the channel , as shown in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_example ] .",
    "the plotted time - averaged field is normalized to the magnetic field amplitude @xmath24 of a plane wave with @xmath20 .",

    "the presented example illustrates that , in a sub - critical plasma irradiated by a long laser pulse , electron acceleration takes place in a positively charged channel in the presence of extended transverse quasi - static electric and magnetic fields and a localized quasi - static longitudinal electric field .",
    "these fields are relatively small compared to the fields in the laser pulse , not exceeding a few percent .",
    "it is then somewhat unexpected that , for example , the transverse electric field can significantly enhance the electron energy gain  @xcite .",
    "as we show in the following sections , the transverse and longitudinal electric fields can synergistically enhance the electron energy gain , with a well - pronounced threshold , well beyond the energy gain that one would expect in the absence of these fields .",

    "[ fig:2d_example ] , electrons are injected into the channel from the side with the laser beam already present in the channel .",
    "this raises the question regarding the role of electron injection in determining both the threshold and the energy gain .",
    "we test the role of injection by seeding an electron without any initial momentum into a plane wave with a given initial phase . specifically , the wave amplitude is set to @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the phase of the laser pulse at the moment of injection defined as @xmath151 .",

    "the free oscillations along the @xmath23-axis are coupled to the driven electron motion in the @xmath22-plane via the relativistic @xmath42-factor , @xmath156 .",
    "as long as the amplitude of the free oscillations remains small , the @xmath42-factor is determined predominantly by the driven motion .",
    "taking the @xmath42-factor in the vacuum regime shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_dla_vac_2 ] as an example of the driven motion , we can conclude that the driven motion affects the natural frequency @xmath121 in two ways : it increases the natural frequency roughly by a factor of @xmath8 for @xmath41 and it also strongly modulates the natural frequency . the first aspect has been discussed in detail earlier in this section and it is responsible for the onset of the significant energy enhancement .",
    "the modulation of the natural frequency can make the free oscillations along the @xmath23-axis parametrically unstable .",
    "the @xmath42-factor modulations effectively modulate the restoring force acting on the oscillator described by eq .",
    "( [ free_perp_osc ] ) .",
    "it is then intuitively clear that the oscillations remain stable as long as the modulation frequency is much higher than the natural frequency @xmath121 .",
    "the oscillations become unstable when the two frequencies become comparable .",
    "as already discussed , the driven electron motion below the energy enhancement threshold can be approximated by the solution for the vacuum regime .",
    "we again consider an electron that is irradiated by a plane wave in the channel and assume that the initial displacement is much smaller than @xmath115 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath157 and we then find from the @xmath42 profile shown in fig .",

    "free oscillations should be stable below the threshold .",
    "as we cross the threshold by increasing the ion density , two important changes in the dependence of the @xmath42-factor on @xmath55 take place .",
    "the @xmath42-factor is significantly increased , which greatly increases the natural frequency .",
    "in addition to that , the modulations of the @xmath42-factor become less frequent .",
    "this is because the peaks of enhanced @xmath42 act as modulations and they take multiple laser cycles to develop .",
    "the combination of these two factors changes the relation between the two characteristic frequencies to @xmath159 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the energy enhancement changes the stability of the free oscillations , making them susceptible to the parametric instability .    a parameter scan over the same range of @xmath8 and @xmath136 as in fig .  [ invited_pop_figure_8 ]",
    "reveals that there is a threshold for the amplification of the free transverse oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this threshold matches the energy enhancement threshold ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ invited_pop_figure_8 ] ) , because the energy enhancement triggers the growth of the electron oscillations along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "the amplitude of the free oscillations grows until it becomes comparable to @xmath115 .",
    "the amplitude of the driven oscillations , i.e. the oscillations along the @xmath36-axis , also has an enhancement threshold that matches the energy enhancement threshold as well .",
    "we find that , in general , the electron energy enhancement is accompanied by a considerable enhancement of the transverse oscillations across the channel , making the electron trajectory considerably three - dimensional with the maximum displacement comparable to @xmath125 .",
    "to illustrate this point , we show in fig .",
    "[ figure_9 ] electron trajectories for @xmath20 and @xmath160 .",
    "these parameters are above the threshold according to fig .",

    "we have examined a regime in which a laser pulse with relativistic intensity irradiates a sub - critical plasma over a time period much longer than the characteristic electron response time .",
    "it is shown that a steady - state channel is formed in the plasma in this case with quasi - static transverse and longitudinal electric fields .",
    "these fields , even though they are much smaller than the electric field in the laser pulse , profoundly alter the electron dynamics .",
    "the longitudinal electric field reduces the longitudinal dephasing between the electron and the wave .",
    "this allows the electron to gain significantly more energy from the wave . the energy gain in this regime",
    "is ultimately limited by the superluminosity of the wave fronts induced by the plasma in the channel , even though the relativistic transparency greatly reduces the role of the plasma .",
    "the transverse electric field alters the oscillations of the transverse electron velocity . as a result",
    ", it can remain anti - parallel to the laser electric field , which leads to significant energy gain by the electron from the wave .",
    "we showed that this process has a sharp threshold determined by a single parameter , @xmath146 .",
    "the threshold can be greatly reduced and the energy gain further enhanced by appropriately injecting electrons into the laser pulse . the threshold for the energy enhancement matches the threshold for the onset of the parametric instability in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the driven electron oscillation .",
    "therefore , the trajectories of electrons with enhanced energies eventually become non - planar if the interaction time and length with the pulse are sufficient for the instability to develop .",
    "the effect of the longitudinal electric field is akin to pre - acceleration of electrons in the longitudinal direction .",
    "analysis of pre - accelerated electrons in a channel  @xcite has showed that pre - acceleration reduces the energy enhancement threshold and increases the electron energy gain .",
    "this indicates that the transverse and longitudinal electric fields can synergistically enhance the electron energy gain .",
    "further in - depth research is required to determine the energy scalings and the key parameters that determine the electron dynamics .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that even though the presented analysis was motivated by laser - plasma interactions at significantly sub - critical plasma densities , most of the results are much more general and they are not limited just to the regime where @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , the analysis is well suited to make meaningful predictions regarding electron acceleration in near - critical and over - critical plasmas , provided that such plasmas are relativistically transparent to the incoming high - intensity laser pulse  @xcite .",
