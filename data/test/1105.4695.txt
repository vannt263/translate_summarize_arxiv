    "whose precise definition is not obvious , the understanding has been accumulated from several viewpoints @xcite . in particular , in addition to an insightful phenomenological argument @xcite , which is often referred to as _ a random first - order transition scenario _ ( rfot ) , the analysis within the equilibrium statistical mechanics has provided quantitative results for structural glass transitions @xcite . at present ,",
    "it has become widely conjectured that a thermodynamic glass transition , if it exists , is described as a one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) in the spin glass terminology . despite such successes , a theory of glass transition in finite - dimensional ,",
    "short - range interaction systems is still one of challenging problems in physics , because the theory on the basis of equilibrium statistical mechanics has been established only for models with infinite - range interaction or on a random graph .    here",
    ", let us recall a history of studies on critical phenomena .",
    "the van der waals theory is the first breakthrough of theory for critical phenomena , which might correspond to rfot for glass transitions .",
    "it should be noted that the statistical mechanics of a model with an infinite - range interaction exactly predicts critical phenomena in accordance with the van der waals theory @xcite .",
    "this reminds us a relation between 1rsb in mean - field type models and rfot in phenomenology .",
    "then , the existence of a critical point within the equilibrium statistical mechanics of short - range interaction hamiltonians was shown by peierls @xcite , kramers - wannier @xcite , and onsager @xcite .",
    "in particular , onsager solved the two - dimension ising model exactly and proved that critical phenomena in finite dimensions are qualitatively different from the van der waals theory ( or the curie - weiss theory in ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transitions ) .",
    "since then , the significance of critical phenomena in finite dimensions has been recognized and much effort has been done in order to connect between onsager s result and the van der waals theory .",
    "we now understand a great picture of critical phenomena .",
    "however , with regard to glass transitions , there is no exactly solved example in finite dimensions ; rather , there is no finite - dimensional , short - range interaction model for which the existence of a glass transition is understood theoretically . thus far , toward establishment of statistical mechanics of glass transition in finite dimensions , several lattice models have been proposed .",
    "one example is a class of models proposed by biroli and mzard @xcite , in which at most @xmath0 neighboring particles are allowed to contact with each particle .",
    "although this simple model exhibits a glass transition when it is defined on a random graph , crystallization occurs in finite - dimensional lattices except for subtle cases @xcite . in the other model proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite , crystallization might be prohibited , and the numerical experiment has been performed in order to explore the nature of thermodynamic glass transitions @xcite .",
    "however , it seems difficult to develop a theoretical argument for this model in finite dimensions .",
    "furthermore , finite - dimensional quenched - disordered spin models that exhibit 1rsb under the mean - field approximation have been studied numerically @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical computation is much harder than standard spin glass models , and a precise theory for the model might be quite challenging .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite as such a theoretical attempt . )",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we first propose finite - dimensional hard - constraint models for which ground states can be constructed theoretically . here , the ground states are obtained by taking the limit of the chemical potential to be infinitely large , because the chemical potential is the only thermodynamic intensive variable in such models .",
    "indeed , we can show that our model possesses uncountably infinite number of ground states in the infinite size lattice , and typical ground states are irregular in the sense that they do not exhibit any long - range positional order characterized by the existence of bragg peaks .",
    "note that quasi - periodic ground states are classified as regular ground states .",
    "let us denote a set of all ground - state configurations by @xmath1 , which we can specify theoretically for our models .",

    "since @xmath3 is defined for each ground state @xmath4 , we have an infinite - dimensional vector @xmath5 .",
    "we refer this vector to as _ the order parameter _ , because this corresponds to the magnetization in the ising model .",
    "we explain the correspondence by reviewing the phase transition in the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "when the temperature is higher than the critical temperature , in the thermodynamic limit , there exists a unique expectation value of observables with being independent of boundary conditions .",
    "however , the independence of boundary conditions is broken below the critical temperature .",
    "in general , a state of the system without the uniqueness is referred to as _ the ordered phase_. the dependence on boundary conditions is most easily observed when the expectation of the magnetization is considered under the spin - up boundary condition or the spin - down boundary condition .",
    "we here notice that the magnetization is equivalent to the overlap with one ground state .",
    "we thus consider the overlap with each ground state as the generalization of the magnetization .",
    "we also generalize spin - up and spin - down boundary conditions to special boundary conditions that uniquely determine a ground - state configuration for a series of system sizes going to the infinity .",
    "we call such a boundary condition a _ gs - boundary condition_.    since we have the glass order parameter @xmath6 in our models , we can investigate whether or not the expectation value of @xmath6 takes a different value under every gs - boundary condition . if the dependence is shown , the existence of an ordered phase characterized by the parameter @xmath6 is claimed . from a fact that a typical ground state does not exhibit a long - range positional order , we identify the ordered phase as _ the glass phase_. as far as we know",

    "that is , a transition is understood from the competition between the entropy cost of configurations with interfaces and the energy cost of holes . however , up to the present , we do not have an explicit definition of such interfaces .",
    "a more important but difficult problem is to obtain a mathematical description of statistical properties of the glass order parameter @xmath6 .",
    "when we consider this problem , it seems better to forget the tile model .",
    "instead , we will analyze a stratified model of the 3-body spin interaction on upward triangles .",
    "( see a remark at the end of section [ complete ] . ) by applying the same argument in the present paper to the spin model , we may find a glass transition for the stratified model .",
    "since this model is much simpler than the tile model , several theoretical calculations including a sort of the bethe approximation will be done more easily .",
    "such theoretical study may provide a connection to the mean - field picture of the glass transition ( rfot ) .",
    "furthermore , it is amazing if we find an exactly solved model that exhibits a glass transition .",
    "an exact solved model would play a crucial influence on the study of glass transitions .    in the analysis of infinite - range interaction models that exhibit a glass transition ,",
    "the number of pure states in the glass phase has been one of concerns . with regard to this problem ,",
    "we briefly review gibbs measures of infinite - size systems . roughly speaking",
    ", a gibbs measure is defined in such a way that the probability of configurations in any finite - size region is given by the grand canonical ensemble with boundary conditions which are chosen by the measure . in the disordered phase ,",
    "the gibbs measure is unique , while there are an infinite number of gibbs measures if the uniqueness is broken . in particular , a special measure that can not be decomposed further into a superposition of other gibbs measures is called a pure state . here",
    ", let us recall that each gs - boundary condition in the ising model can provide a pure state .",
    "although gs - boundary conditions are not always related to pure states , the statistical ensembles in finite systems under gs - boundary conditions may be a starting point for understanding of pure states in the glass phase .",
    "finally , we go back to our motivation of understanding the nature of glassy materials . although we have found a thermodynamic glass transition in a short - range interaction model in finite dimensions , it is not obvious whether or not such an idealized phase is actually observed in laboratory experiments . toward an experimental realization of thermodynamic glass phases , we need to consider the following problems",
    "the first is to construct a mechanical model that exhibits a glass transition .",
    "although we have only to design a potential function sharing common features with hard - constraint conditions in wang tiles , its explicit demonstration may be challenging .",
    "the second problem is to find an experimentally realizable algorithm for facilitating the equilibration , because the exchange mc method can not be employed in laboratory experiments . after solving the problems , we hope that we will be able to demonstrate by numerical experiments that a genuine thermodynamic glass transition is observed in laboratories .",
