    "according to observations the very high energy ( vhe ) particles are detected by several modern facilities and therefore , one of the major problems in this context is to understand the origin of such energetic cosmic rays . despite many attempts",
    "this problem still remains the long standing one modern astrophysics encounters .    in order to explain enormous energies of cosmic rays",
    "a prominent physicist enrico fermi has proposed a process , which now is called fermi acceleration mechanism . according to his approach",
    "the cosmic particles are accelerated in the interstellar space by means of collisions against moving magnetic walls ( ref . ) .",
    "a substantial modification has been considered in ( refs . ) , but as it has been realised this fermi - type processes are efficient only for `` pre - accelerated '' particles with relatively high initial energies ( ref . ) .",
    "an interesting alternative mechanism has been hypothesised by gold for explaining the pulsating radio sources ( refs . ) .",
    "the author has argued that due to the frozen - in condition plasma particles follow rapidly rotating magnetic field lines and as a result , undergo very efficient centrifugal force , leading to efficient acceleration of particles , which after gaining enormous energy can radiate away vhe photons .",
    "a very simplified theoretical model has been studied in ( ref . ) where the authors have considered dynamics of particles freely sliding along straight rotating channels .",
    "it has been shown that by the influence of relativistic effects of rotation the particles might efficiently accelerate in a region called light cylinder - a hypothetical zone , where linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light .",
    "although in realistic astrophysical situations the field lines are often curved .",
    "therefore , a certain generalisation of the mentioned model has been presented in ( ref . ) , where instead of straight rotating channels the curved trajectories has been studied . by taking into account the observationally evident fact that cosmic rays are in force - free regime , we have found that in order for particles to reach the mentioned dynamical pattern the channels must have the shape of the archimede s spiral .",
    "on the other hand , one ca show that in the light cylinder zone , by means of the curvature drift instability the magnetosphere of pulsars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) reconstruct and the field lines twist behind the rotation getting the shape of the archimede s spiral ( ref . ) .",
    "a series of articles has been dedicated to mechanism of magnetocentrifugal acceleration in the magnetospheres of pulsars and agns ( ref . ) .",
    "generally speaking , when charged particles accelerate , they radiate , inevitably leading to the so - called radiation reaction force ( see ref . and references therein ) , that in turn , will influence the overall dynamics of particles .",
    "this particular problem has been studied in ( ref . ) , where the authors have shown that the radiation reaction force under certain conditions may lead to centripetal motion .",
    "it also has been found that due to the existence of radiation reaction force locations of stable equilibrium might exist .",
    "similar but a slightly different physical situation arises when centrifugally accelerating particles move in a photon background and as a result undergo the so - called radiation drag force .",
    "such a physical situation is very natural because nearby zones of many extreme astrophysical objects are characterised by high photon field densities.therefore , it is interesting to consider this particular problem and study how centrifugal acceleration is influenced by the photon drag force .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way . in section  ii , a theoretical model of centrifugal acceleration",
    "is presented , in section  iii we consider results and in section  iv we summarise them .",
    "we consider particle motion in two dimensions alongside a wire anchored to the central object which is rotating with angular velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the form of the wire is given in polar coordinates as @xmath1 and consequently the channel is located in the equatorial plane . in general , magnetospheres of astrophysical objects are full of a photon field and in certain cases their contribution in dynamics of particles might be significant .",
    "this particular term might be given as a friction force acting from the high density photons on the moving particles @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lorenz factor of the particle , @xmath4 is its total velocity in the laboratory reference frame ( lf ) , @xmath5 is expressed as to be ( see ref . and",
    "references therein ) @xmath6 @xmath7 is the speed of light and @xmath8 is the energy density of the photon field .    by taking into account that the channels are co - rotating with angular velocity @xmath0 the effective angular velocity of the particle in the lf writes as @xmath9 which leads to the following lorenz factor of the particle @xmath10 where @xmath11 and henceforth we use @xmath12 .",
    "the radial and azimuthal components of particle s relativistic momentum are given by @xmath13 after introducing the reaction force , @xmath14 , acting on the particle from the field line , one can straightforwardly check that the set of equations governing the dynamics of a particle writes as @xmath15 which finally reduce to the following expression for the radial acceleration @xmath16",
    "in this section we study the influence of the photon field drag force on dynamics of particles . for this purpose",
    "we examine several particular configurations of the field lines : straight line , archimedes spiral and the dipolar field line .      in this case",
    "the shape of a wire is given by @xmath17 , which leads eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) to the following expression @xmath18 for numerical solutions we need two initial conditions .",
    "those are initial radial distance @xmath19 and initial radial velocity @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting that motion of a particle for @xmath21 is a bit different from a scenario when there is no friction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we plot temporal evolution of the radial coordinate , radial velocity , and the reaction force .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( dotted line ) , @xmath28 ( dashed line ) and @xmath29 ( solid line ) .",
    "as it is clear from the plots by increasing the photon drag force , motion slows down in time . as a result ,",
    "the particle reaches the light cylinder , but for higher values of @xmath5 this happens later .",
    "we see the similar behaviour for the lorenz factor and reaction force .    , the radial velocity @xmath30 , the lorenz factor @xmath31 and the reaction force @xmath32 .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( dotted line ) , @xmath28 ( dashed line ) and @xmath29 ( solid line ) . ]    from the previous study it is known that if at the origin initial velocity is more than @xmath33 then the radial acceleration is becomes negative from the very beginning of motion .",
    "the situation changes if friction is present . as as it is clear from the plots , the initial acceleration is negative if @xmath21 . for the general case , when the photon field is present , from eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) one can straightforwardly show that the minimum radial velocity , when the corresponding component of acceleration is still negative is given by @xmath34^{-1}}\\right)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] it is evident that when @xmath35 and @xmath36 then @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) we show the behaviour of @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the minimum velocity is a continuously decreasing function of the drag coefficient .    .",
    "shape of wire is straight line .",
    "the set of parameters is : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      in this subsection we consider a particular configuration of field lines : the archimede s spiral @xmath42 where @xmath43 is constant .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) reduces to @xmath44 it is particularly interesting to examine two principally different cases of the archimede s spiral : a ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 .      , the radial velocity @xmath30 , the effective angular velocity , @xmath47 , the lorenz factor @xmath31 and the reaction force @xmath32 .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath27 ( dotted line ) , @xmath28 ( dashed line ) and @xmath29 ( solid line ) . ]    , @xmath50 , @xmath48 .",
    "( a ) @xmath27 , ( b ) @xmath51 , ( c ) @xmath28 . solid line shows asymptotic value of radial velocity ( @xmath52 ) ]    under certain conditions dynamics of the particle tends to be force free . as it is seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , regardless of the value of @xmath5 effective angular velocity decreases and asymptotically vanishes , but the process becomes relatively slow for bigger values of @xmath5 . as a result , from eq .",
    "( [ omef ] ) we obtain @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) we present the temporal behaviour of radial velocity for different initial velocities and different photon field drag coefficients .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath54 , @xmath50 , @xmath48 , ( a ) @xmath27 , ( b ) @xmath51 , ( c ) @xmath28 .",
    "the horizontal solid line corresponds to the asymptotic radial velocity .",
    "as we see , the radial velocity tends to the corresponding asymptotic value , thus the dynamics becomes fore - free .",
    "the similar result is clearly seen in the plot of @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) ) .",
    "it is worth noting that force - free dynamics for the negligible photon field on the one hand and the significant drag force on the other is achieved differently .",
    "in particular , for @xmath22 the value of reaction force vanishes ( ref . ) , but when @xmath35 the corresponding reaction force tends to the asymptotic value of the friction force canceling it .",
    "one can straightforwardly show that for the reaction force one has @xmath55 therefore , the saturated value of @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "one more difference is that if in non - friction mode with the initial radial velocity @xmath57 it always remains the same , for @xmath35 and the same initial conditions the particle starts to decelerate at first and then tends to this value ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath57 must be less than @xmath58 in order to achieve the force free regime , otherwise dynamics is much like the case @xmath59 .      , the radial velocity @xmath30 , the effective angular velocity , @xmath47 , the lorenz factor @xmath31 and the components of the reaction force @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath62 , @xmath49 , @xmath27 ( dotted line ) , @xmath28 ( dashed line ) and @xmath29 ( solid line ) . ]",
    "this case is completely different from the previous one .",
    "configuration of the channel is such that the particle can be in stable equilibrium .",
    "numerical results show that regardless of the value of @xmath5 particle s radial velocity and radial acceleration both tend to zero and consequently the radial distance tends to a finite value .",
    "this means that effective angular velocity finally becomes @xmath0 .",
    "this is also clearly seen from numerical solutions ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) ) . after substituting @xmath63 and @xmath64 into eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) one can derive an expression for the stable radial distance @xmath65 being valid for any @xmath1 .",
    "for the particular case",
    "@xmath66 this equation has one solution @xmath67 it clear that @xmath68 is less than the light cylinder radius if @xmath43 is positive and the photon drag force is present .",
    "notice that ratio of the stable radial distance in the light cylinder coordinates depends only on the following dimensionless parameter @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the light cylinder radius .",
    "the corresponding behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) .     on the parameter @xmath69,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    from eqs .",
    "( [ dpr ] ) and ( [ dpfi ] ) it is evident that the reaction force components are given by @xmath72 these expressions also follow from the fact that all the forces at stable equilibrium point must be zero .",
    "radial component must be equal to centrifugal force @xmath73 , and azimuthal to friction force @xmath74 .",
    "in this subsection we study stable equilibrium points on a field lines corresponding to the dipolar magnetic field .",
    "the shape of the magnetic field lines is given by the equation @xmath75 where l is constant and defines a length scale of a field line .",
    "when the dipole magnetic moment is located in the equatorial plane , which is the case we consider here , then @xmath1 can be expressed as follows @xmath76 where @xmath77 changes from zero to @xmath78 .",
    "it is obvious that stable equilibrium point must be on @xmath79 because @xmath80 is negative and consequently eq .  ( [ rst ] )",
    "does not have solution .",
    "therefore equation for @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 its obvious that solution for @xmath83 depends only on two parameters : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "although this equation can be transformed to a cubic form , only one of three solutions will satisfy eq .",
    "( [ rst3 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding numerical solutions are given in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) . as one can see from the plots as @xmath86 , @xmath68 either approaches @xmath87 or @xmath78 .",
    "that depends or relation of @xmath87 and @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath88 ( the field line is fully inside the light cylinder ) when @xmath86 , @xmath68 approaches to @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath89 ( the field line is only partially inside the light cylinder ) as @xmath86 , @xmath68 approaches the light cylinder area .",
    "as @xmath5 increases @xmath68 vanishes in the both cases .     on the parameter @xmath84",
    "when for two different values of the parameter @xmath90 : ( a ) 0.5 and ( b ) 2.0 ]",
    "1 .   for studying the influence of the photon field on the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of charged particles in rotating magnetospheres we examined dynamics of particles restricted by the photon drag force in the isotropic case",
    "for this purpose three different configurations have been considered : the straight line ; the archimede s spiral and the configuration of the dipolar field line .",
    "we found that for straight lines ( @xmath17 ) there is not much difference in dynamics when friction is present .",
    "particle still approaches the light cylinder zone but more slowly as friction coefficient increases .",
    "we have shown that the minimum radial velocity when the radial acceleration is initially negative , decreases if the drag force is present .",
    "3 .   we have found that when the field line has a shape of the archimede s spiral ( @xmath42 ) the photon drag force strongly influences dynamics of particles in some cases . when @xmath45 and @xmath91 the particle tends to the force free regime :",
    "reaction and friction forces cancel each other in infinity .",
    "regardless of the value of friction coefficient the effective angular velocity tends to zero and therefore , the velocity approaches @xmath92 . when @xmath46 and @xmath35 there is the stable equilibrium point inside the light cylinder .",
    "radial distance of this point decreases as @xmath5 increases .",
    "if the field line has a shape of the dipolar magnetic field , @xmath93 , on right part of it there is always stable equilibrium point .",
    "as friction coefficient increases radial distance of equilibrium point decreases .",
    "as friction approaches zero this distance tends to furthest point of field line if it is fully in light cylinder and if it is nt than the distance approaches light cylinder radius .",
    "this study was a first attempt of this kind , therefore , in the present paper we only generally considered the problem without particular applications to astrophysical objects .",
    "the whole universe is full of the photon field , starting from the cosmic background radiation up to high density photon fields in such extreme environments as the magnetospheres of agns and pulsars .",
    "therefore , as a next step we intend to apply the results obtained in this work to the mentioned astrophysical objects .",
    "a particular interest deserve the stable equilibrium locations , which might be interesting in the context of luminous bunches observed in certain extragalactic jets . for applying to jets",
    "it is clear that the next generalisation will be the study of field lines in @xmath94 .",
