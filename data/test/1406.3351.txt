    "the life cycles of dwarf galaxies with present - day stellar masses @xmath13 illustrate many challenges to our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "while we see that starbursts do not play an important role in the global star - formation at the present epoch @xcite , it is likely that the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies are complex and varied @xcite and that their typical star - formation rates were higher in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "that star formation in low - mass galaxies may be very burst - like is predicted by hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", star formation appears to be regulated by stellar feedback in the form of supernovae and winds that heat and deplete the central reservoirs of cold gas required for continued star formation . in simulations of lower mass systems ,",
    "feedback is predicted to eject gas out of the galaxy and into the halo , resulting in an episodic star formation history across the entire galaxy @xcite .",
    "repeated bursts have been cited as the driving force behind intense feedback mechanisms that can change the dynamical profile of the systems by driving baryons out of the center of the halo on short time scales , which also displaces the dark matter from the center and creates a cored dark matter profile @xcite , potentially addressing one of the principal challenges to the standard @xmath14cdm cosmology .    until recently , however , the progenitors of contemporary dwarf galaxies at high - redshift could not be studied directly .",
    "`` archaeological '' studies of resolved stellar populations in local dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have confirmed that their star - formation histories are indeed not smooth , and have also found that a large fraction of their stars formed at early epochs ( @xmath15 ) . for such old stellar populations ( @xmath16 gyr ) , the age resolution achieved by the archaeological approach is insufficient to distinguish star formation events with durations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 years , leaving the actual `` burstiness '' of the star formation history unconstrained .",
    "look - back studies , directly observing the star formation activity in very low - mass systems at @xmath15 , were impractical until recently .",
    "but , near - infrared spectroscopy and deep imaging from the wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has provided a new opportunity .",
    "an abundant population of galaxies at @xmath19 with extremely high equivalent widths ( ews ) was found by @xcite using data from the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep legacy survey ( candels , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they find a large number of objects with unusual @xmath20 and @xmath21 colors which imply the presence of a bright emission line in the @xmath22-band , likely to be [ o iii ] after considering other photometric constraints .",
    "slitless grism spectroscopy confirms the redshifts and emission - line interpretation of four of these objects .",
    "these are the high - ew tail of the emission line galaxies found in @xcite via slitless grism spectroscopy at the hst , a tail which is also probed by @xcite .",
    "other objects with similarly low masses and metallicities at these redshifts have been discovered in @xcite ( 2012b ; @xmath23,rest}$]=1499  ) and @xcite ( 2013 ; @xmath23,rest}$]=1200  ) assisted by strong gravitational lensing , in @xcite ( 2014 ; @xmath23,rest}$]=154  ) , in @xcite ( 2010 ; @xmath23,rest}$]=285  ) , and in @xcite ( 2013 ; discussed further below ) .",
    "all of these objects are emission - line dominated systems with low metallicities and high equivalent widths , the so - called `` extreme emission line galaxies '' ( eelgs ) .",
    "these systems are likely the high - ew tail of the distribution of high - redshift dwarf galaxies , and resemble the class of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observed locally in several ways : low masses , high sfrs relative to their mass , and strong emission lines .",
    "however , the eelgs are indeed `` extreme , '' with ssfr values an order of magnitude higher than the bcds , similar to the strong [ o iii ] emitters ( `` green peas '' ) discovered photometrically in the sdss by @xcite , as well as spectroscopically by @xcite and @xcite . as suggested by those authors , the star - formation mode exhibited in the `` green peas '' is likely a relic of a mode that was much more prevalent in the earlier universe : their comoving number density is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the value of @xmath24 for eelgs at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the implication of strong emission lines and an extremely faint continuum are that these systems have low masses and are undergoing an intense burst of star formation .",
    "equivalent widths @xmath25 100  @xmath26 and stellar masses of @xmath27 imply specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) in excess of 10 gyr@xmath28 , which is more than an order of magnitude higher than star - forming systems of equivalent masses at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "these low stellar and dynamical masses are confirmed in @xcite , who also rule - out significant contributions to the total mass from older stellar populations for objects with restframe [ o iii]@xmath29 equivalent widths @xmath30 @xmath26 and intimate that the bursts are intense and have low metallicities .",
    "the implied star formation rates and masses have only been reproduced recently in hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. in * ? ? ?",
    "although these previous observational studies have placed constraints on various quantities , many uncertainties remain . in the case of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "all of the observed [ o iii ] , h@xmath31 , and h@xmath7 emission is attributed to star formation and not agn . in @xcite ,",
    "upper - limits are placed on the black hole masses from the uv - continuum slopes , but their starbursting nature is merely plausible given the lack of knowledge about low - metallicity agn @xcite .",
    "low metallicies are simply inferred from the consistency of the sed fits using low - z ( 0.2 @xmath8 ) templates with the observed photometry .",
    "these objects represent a field of growing importance , both for studies of low - mass dwarf galaxies and for the highest - z galaxies observed . depending on the strength , duration , and initial mass of these bursts",
    ", the descendants could display a wide range of masses , from present - day @xmath32 dwarf galaxies to potentially milky way - like systems , particularly if merging is important . in any case , these galaxies are also significant contaminants in searches for higher - z dropout sources @xcite , as in the case of _ udfj-30546284 _",
    "as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , great care must be taken in the interpretation of high - z candidates , as eelgs can potentially reproduce their observed colors ( although the implied ews in the latter case exceeded those that can be produced from star formation alone ) .",
    "some issues still remain in our understanding of such systems , such as stringent limits to the low masses and metallicities , including those with ews @xmath33 500  , and the starburst origin of their strong emission lines . here",
    "we combine both high- and low - resolution near - ir spectroscopy with broadband photometry . with the low - resolution spectra , we select candidates for follow - up high - resolution spectroscopy and obtain emission line fluxes .",
    "the high - resolution spectra constrain various emission line ratios , some of which are useful diagnostics of agn activity , as well as line widths , which are themselves a probe of the dynamical masses of the systems .",
    "this provides strong evidence for their low masses and low metallicities , as well as confirming their starbursting nature .",
    "sophisticated modeling of the broadband seds constrains the stellar masses and ages , as well as providing information on the dust content and metallicities .",
    "together , this tells us about the strength and duration of the star - forming event .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath34 2",
    "we describe the near - infrared spectroscopy and multi - band photometry used in the initial candidate selection process and the subsequent follow - up observations .",
    "@xmath34 3 presents the results of the spectroscopic study , including emission - line widths , physical sizes , and masses . in @xmath34 4",
    "we confirm their low metallicities and rule out agn as a significant source of contamination .",
    "@xmath34 5 presents the implications of this work for the gas content of these systems , and @xmath34 6 summarizes our findings and puts the results into the overall context of the formation history of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath35 and h@xmath36 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 and a @xcite imf throughout .",
    "in order to search for and investigate these `` starbursting dwarf galaxies , '' we take a multi - faceted approach .",
    "our preliminary search utilizes data from the 3d - hst survey @xcite , a near - infrared spectroscopic treasury program utilizing the wfc3 .",
    "this program provides wfc3/ir primary and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) parallel imaging and grism spectroscopy over approximately three - quarters ( 625 square arcminutes ) of the candels fields .",
    "the main source of spectroscopic data comes from the wfc3 g141 grism , with an effective wavelength coverage of 1.1 to 1.65 @xmath37 m .",
    "@xmath38 and squares represent equivalent widths from h@xmath7 .",
    "the equivalent widths were determined from photometry and grism spectroscopy , see section [ sec : sel ] . for objects in which both [ o iii ] and h@xmath7 are visible in the grism spectrum , both equivalent widths are plotted .",
    "open symbols show objects without luci1 line detections , due to intrinsic faintness or skyline contamination .",
    "our emission - line detection rate is close to 100% for objects with ew @xmath25 300 .,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    the grism data allow us to select and confirm strong line emitters spectroscopically .",
    "photometric cuts , such as the @xmath39 cut of @xcite and a similar @xmath40 selection ( excess in @xmath41 compared to a blue continuum , all from candels ) , are used to preselect objects with strong features in their seds .",
    "the g141 grism data are reduced according to @xcite for the ukidss ultra - deep survey ( uds ) , goods - south ( goods - s ) , and cosmos fields , and are then used to confirm bright lines with little or no associated continuum . while we find numerous examples of these objects at @xmath15 ( maseda et al . in prep . ) , we focus here on objects where the emission lines do not fall in the wavelength range between the @xmath22- , @xmath41- , and @xmath42-bands , enhancing the chances for detectability from the ground .",
    "the low - resolution wfc3 grism data ( @xmath43 ) provide redshift information such that targets can be selected with [ o iii ] in the redshift range 1.15 @xmath44 2.40 and h@xmath7 in the redshift range 0.64 @xmath44 1.59 to @xmath45z / z @xmath12 0.005 . however , our photometric preselection relies on flux excesses such that we mostly see objects at 1.3 @xmath46 1.8 and 2.1 @xmath46 2.3 .",
    "note that we do not resolve the continuum in our ground - based observations ( discussed presently ) , so all ew values are calculated from the grism spectra directly . in total , we select 31 objects for ground - based spectroscopic observations using this method .",
    "an additional five candidates are taken from the sample of @xcite and one from @xcite .",
    "their equivalent widths as a function of redshift are shown in figure [ fig : ewz ] .",
    "non - detections are due to either intrinsic faintness in the lines ( we are sensitive to line flux in our ground - based spectra , not ew ) or contamination from oh - skylines .",
    "we observed our grism - selected sample with the luci1 multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the 8.4 m _ large binocular telescope _ ( lbt ) .",
    "we use luci1 in mos mode , splitting our 31 candidates between four masks , during april 2012 ( two masks in the cosmos field ) , october 2012 ( one mask in the uds field ) , and march 2013 ( an additional mask in the cosmos field ) . approximately two hours are spent observing in each of the @xmath22- and @xmath41-bands for the first two cosmos masks ( a and b ) using 1@xmath47 slits , two hours in each of the @xmath41- and @xmath42-bands for the uds mask ( c ) with 0.6@xmath47 slits , and three total hours on the final cosmos mask ( d ) in the @xmath22- and @xmath41-bands using 0.6@xmath47 slits .",
    "all data are taken using the high - resolution @xmath48 grating ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "the exposures are dithered by 3@xmath47 and are of varying durations , depending on the band : @xmath22-band data using 600s exposures , @xmath41-band data with 300s exposures , and @xmath42-band data with 120s exposures .",
    "the shorter integrations in the @xmath41- and @xmath42-bands lead to lower signal - to - noise ( s / n ) due to additional readnoise , but are necessary so as not to saturate the detector in the regions with the brightest oh sky lines .",
    "seeing was generally good ( between 0.5@xmath47 and 1@xmath47 in the optical ) during the cosmos observations , with good transparency .",

    ", we do not use frame - frame subtraction and instead measure the sky from the individual frames , with the exception being some objects with particularly bad skyline contamination , where frame - frame subtraction better removes the skylines but adds noise to the spectrum . dithering the exposures by 3@xmath47",

    "<S> we present near - infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 22 extreme emission line galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 , confirming that these are low - mass ( @xmath1 ) galaxies undergoing intense starburst episodes ( @xmath2 10 @xmath3 100 myr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is selected by [ o iii ] or @xmath4 emission line flux and equivalent width using near - infrared grism spectroscopy from the 3d - hst survey . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution nir spectroscopy is obtained with lbt / luci and vlt / x - shooter . </S>",
    "<S> the [ o iii]/@xmath5 line ratio is high ( @xmath6 ) and [ n ii]/h@xmath7 is always significantly below unity , which suggests a low gas - phase metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to determine gas - phase metallicities for 7 of our objects using various strong - line methods , with values in the range 0.05 @xmath3 0.30 @xmath8 and with a median of 0.15 @xmath8 ; for 3 of these objects we detect [ o iii]@xmath94363 which allows for a direct constraint on the metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion , as measured from the nebular emission lines , is typically @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the observed star - forming activity , the jeans and toomre stability criteria imply that the gas fraction must be large ( @xmath11 2/3 ) , consistent with the difference between our dynamical and stellar mass estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the implied gas depletion time scale ( several hundred myr ) is substantially longer than the inferred mass - weighted ages ( @xmath1250 myr ) , which further supports the emerging picture that most stars in low - mass galaxies form in short , intense bursts of star formation . </S>"
