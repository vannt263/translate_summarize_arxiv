    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the effect of including the turbulent pressure @xmath1 , derived from the 3-d radiative hydrodynamic simulations of robinson et al .",
    "( described in a companion poster paper ) , into the hydrostatic structure of the outer layers of the models , where @xmath1 is known to be significant ; and to determine the frequency shift caused by the inclusion of @xmath1 on the p - mode oscillation frequencies .",
    "the turbulent pressure was calculated for three models of the evolving sun , corresponding to the sun on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , the present sun , and the future sun as a subgiant .",
    "an evolutionary track for the sun was constructed which includes pre - main sequence evolution and post - main sequence hydrogen burning phases on the giant branch .",
    "the yale stellar evolution code was used .",
    "we also adopted the standard assumptions for the calibration of the present sun as a standard solar model .",
    "the input physics included the opal opacities and equation of state , and the alexander low temperatures opacities .",
    "other physical assumptions were basically as described in guenther & demarque 1997 ) .",
    "the evolutionary track is shown in the theoretical hr - diagram in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to better understand the structure of the atmosphere and of the highly superadiabatic layer ( sal ) along the sequence , a number of 3-d radiative hydrodynamical simulations have been performed using the hydrostatic 1-d stellar models as starting points . the physics ( thermodynamics and microscopic physics ) in the simulation was performed in the same way as in the 1-d stellar models .",
    "these simulations follow closely the approach described by kim & chan ( 1998 ) , and are described in more detail in the companion poster paper by robinson et al .",
    "the full hydrodynamical equations were solved in a thin subsection of the stellar model , i.e. a 3-d box located in the vicinity of the photosphere .",
    "the radiative transport was treated in the following way :    * in the deep region of the simulation , where @xmath2 , the diffusion approximation was used . * in the shallow region above , the 3-d eddington approximation was used ( unno & spiegel 1966 ) .    after the simulation had reached a statistically steady state",
    "( see the poster paper by robinson et al . ) , statistical integration was performed for each simulation , corresponding to over 2500 seconds in the case of the solar surface convection .",
    "some characteristics of the models are illustrated in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 . fig .",
    "2 shows a plot of the ratio of turbulent pressure @xmath3 to the gas pressure @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 ( i.e. depth ) , in the convection simulations for the zams model , the present sun and the subgiant model , respectively .",
    "we note that the peak in the turbulent pressure moves outwards , toward lower @xmath5 , as the sun evolves .",
    "3 compares in addition the kinetic energy density for the two extreme cases of the zams and subgiant models , illustrating the effect of evolution on the atmospheric structure and dynamics .",
    "from the 3-d hydrodynamical simulations , one can derive a turbulent pressure @xmath1 defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean density and @xmath8 denotes the turbulent vertical velocity , i.e. the radial direction in the convection zone .",
    "the turbulent energy per unit mass is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and the turbulent velocities @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions respectively , are scaled by the sound speed at an arbitrary reference point .",
    "each parameter , which consists of a mean and a fluctuating part , is computed from the 3-d statistically averaged flow . for a given parameter @xmath16 ,",
    "the turbulent part is approximated by    @xmath17 ,    where the overbar denotes horizontal and temporal averaging , and @xmath16 is the total quantity ( mean plus fluctuating ) . the turbulent velocities @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 are all computed in this way .    in the 1-d stellar model , one can define a new parameter @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , by analogy with the treatment of magnetic pressure implemented by li & sofia ( 2000 ) in the yale stellar evolution code .",
    "the total pressure is thus defined as , @xmath20 , where @xmath4 and @xmath21 are the gas and radiation pressures , respectively .    the equation of state is now written as @xmath22 while the energy conservation equation is modified by the inclusion of @xmath23 , so that    @xmath24 .",
    "the effects on the p - mode frequencies of introducing turbulent pressure in the stellar models is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "4 and fig.5 refer to the model for the present sun , and fig .  6 and fig .",
    "7 to the zams model .",
    "the oscillation frequencies were calculated using the non - adiabatic oscillation code developed by guenther ( 1994 ) , which includes non - adiabatic corrections due to the effects of radiative processes .",
    "the difference between calculated p - mode frequencies and the observed solar frequencies for non - radial modes with @xmath25 = 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 and 100 , are plotted vs. observed frequency . for each value of @xmath25 , the frequency differences for standard solar models in which the p@xmath26 is respectively ignored ( solid lines ) and included ( dotted lines ) , are plotted .",
    "we see in fig .  4 and fig .  5",
    "that including p@xmath26 reduces the model frequencies by approximately 2 @xmath27hz at the higher frequencies . since the effect of turbulence is only significant near the surface , the shift is the largest at the highest frequencies .",
    "the frequency shift is in the sense of improving agreement between calculated and observed solar frequencies ( antia & basu 1997 ; demarque et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we point out that fig .  4 and fig .",
    "5 show the p - mode frequency shifts due to structural changes in the stellar models , but do not include frequency shifts which might be due to turbulence in the calculation of the oscillation frequencies . as mentioned above ,",
    "while radiation is included in guenther s non - adiabatic frequency calculations , no account is taken of the reynolds stress due to turbulence .",
    "balmforth ( 1992 ) has investigated the effect of turbulence , and found it to be relatively larger than the structural effect on the calculated frequencies , of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "guzik & swenson ( 1997 ) found a shift of a few @xmath0 only for low degree mode ( @xmath25 less than 10 ) , and an increase of up to a few tens @xmath0 for @xmath29 .",
    "more recent studies of the reynolds stress correction on the p - mode frequencies have yielded smaller frequency shifts both using a simple mixing length model ( bhmer & rdiger 1999 ) , and a model of convection which includes a more realistic turbulence energy spectrum ( bi & xu 2000 ) .",
    "an obvious next step is to consider the combined non - adiabatic effects of radiation and turbulence using the turbulent pressure derived from a 3-d physically realistic simulation .",
    "fig .  6 and",
    "7 show the difference between the calculated p - mode frequencies for zams models of the sun , with and without the effects of the turbulent pressure .",
    "we note that the effect of including the turbulent pressure in the zams model is smaller than in the present sun model .    the simulation for the subgiant model indicate that the role of turbulent pressure increases as the star evolves toward the giant branch .",
    "this result is likely to be due to densities in the vicinity of the highly superadiabatic layer that are lower in giants than in main sequence stars .",
    "work is now in progress to extend this simulation grid , and to use the simulations to derive more realistic surface boundary conditions along evolutionary tracks than are currently provided by the mixing length theory of convection .",
