    "the application of perturbation theory in first order gives satisfying results .",
    "however , the level spacing of high lying states ( rydberg states ) is considerably smaller and higher order perturbation theory is required for correct treatment .",
    "the electron configuration of excited states of the alkaline earth elements is determined by the two electrons outside a core of closed electron shells .",
    "the existence of low lying bound doubly excited states causes configuration mixing and influences the coupling of the two valence electrons ( singlet - triplet mixing ) .",
    "the multichannel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) has proved to be an efficient tool @xcite for the description of such perturbed rydberg states with only a small set of parameters .    particularly the atomic hyperfine structure ( hfs )",
    "is sensitive to admixtures in the wave function of rydberg states @xcite and is therefore a most sensitive quantity for investigating such phenomena .    for the evaluation of the hfs it is in most cases sufficient to consider only the magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole interaction .",
    "then it is possible to parameterize the hfs  splitting in first order perturbation theory by the hyperfine constants @xmath4 and @xmath3 , using the casimir formula . the hyperfine constants @xmath4 and @xmath3 measure the magnitude of the magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole interaction , respectively .",
    "this kind of evaluation and separation of the interactions assumes that contributions of higher order perturbation theory are negligible .",
    "if that is not the case the hyperfine constants lose their physical meaning .",
    "previously , the effects of higher order contributions to the hfs in rydberg states due to neighbouring fine structure levels have been observed in hg@xcite , @xmath5he@xcite , ca@xcite , sr@xcite , ba@xcite , sm@xcite , yb@xcite , and pb@xcite .",

    "these measurements were done with enhanced accuracy compared to previous results @xcite , in order to obtain sufficiently precise data for accurate comparison of the hfs with the results derived from second order perturbation theory .",
    "the hfs was calculated by means of mqdt - wavefunctions in first and second order perturbation theory .",
    "we found that second order contributions need to be considered in the analysis of the hfs in order to explain the unexpected large hyperfine constant @xmath3 and the shift of the hyperfine multiplet , which is responsible for large deviations from the linear dependence in a king plot analysis .",
    "the experimental set - up used in the present work has been described in detail in an earlier paper @xcite .",

    "a michelson - type wave meter ( burleigh wa 20 ) with @xmath16mhz accuracy was used for identifying rydberg levels up to @xmath17 .",
    "for measuring the hfs  splittings the laser frequency was stabilized to an external confocal cavity .",
    "this , in turn , was controlled by an active molecular frequency standard with an accuracy of better than @xmath18khz , using several precisely known @xmath19 levels combined with the frequency - offset - locking technique @xcite .",
    "a computer ( hp 21 mx - e ) was employed for real - time data acquisition and for scanning and controlling the laser frequency .",
    "the sr - atoms were excited and , following collisional ionization , detected with high efficiency in a thermionic ring diode @xcite . in order to improve the signal to noise ratio , the retroreflected laser beam was chopped at a frequency of @xmath20hz for lock - in detection ( eg&g par model 5210 ) .    a typical spectrum of the @xmath21 state is shown in fig .  [ fig_spectrum ] .",
    "to determine the line positions , lorentzian line profiles were fitted to the experimental data .",
    "the accuracy of the line distances was enhanced by recording and evaluating several spectra ( up to 40 ) for each state .",

    "the situation changes if one considers contributions of second order perturbation theory .",
    "the second order energy splitting of a state @xmath39 is @xmath40 hence when second order effects are not negligible , i.e.when neighbouring fine structure levels with equal quantum number @xmath37 are lying close together , the energy splitting can no longer be approximated by the casimir formula .",

    "the second order energy splitting goes together with a shift of the center of gravity , since the contribution of each fine structure level has a different @xmath37 dependence ( only states with equal @xmath37 are connected ) .",

    "<S> the hyperfine structure of @xmath0 states in @xmath1sr was studied for principal quantum numbers @xmath2 by doppler - free two - photon excitation combined with thermionic detection . based on the more accurate data , compared to previous results , </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine structure was analysed by second order perturbation theory using mqdt wavefunctions . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we find that the surprisingly large @xmath3-factors obtained by fitting the data with the casimir formula do not reflect a quadrupolar interaction but rather consist predominantly of second order magnetic dipole contributions . </S>",
    "<S> further , inconsistencies in the king plot of odd - even isotope shifts were removed by this type of analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the result demonstrates the importance of higher order effects in hyperfine splittings of excited states in atoms with two valence electrons , even when the fine structure splitting is large compared to the hyperfine splitting .    </S>",
