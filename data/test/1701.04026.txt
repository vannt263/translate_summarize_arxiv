    "it is minimalist in the sense that our departure point is the two - dimensional hilbert space on the real numbers , i.e. the euclidean plane , denoted @xmath5 , so familiar to us since , say , the kindergarden - grade 12 .",

    "the magnitude of the line segment is the `` length '' of the vector .",
    "the `` orientation '' of the line segment we can define as the angle that the line segment makes with the horizontal axis . to be clear this angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive @xmath8 axis and is an angle between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "ok so far we just have a line segment that is situated on the plane somewhere and we know how it is oriented , but there is no arrowhead yet . now the last thing you need is the `` sense '' , that basically tells you where to put the arrowhead and implies an order .",
    "we can define this vector as @xmath11 with an arrow over it , where you read it as the vector starting from @xmath6 and ending at @xmath7 .",
    "_    _ more generally you can define a vector by defining its magnitude ( length ) , its orientation , and then its sense . but keeping in mind , technically a vector is an equivalence class .",
    "so there are an infinite number of vectors which are parallel to each other ( have the same orientation ) and have the same sense or same choice of where to put the arrowhead ( there are only two possible senses , since the arrowhead can be placed on @xmath6 or on @xmath7 ) .",
    "but i do nt want to confuse you .",
    "usually we discuss vectors that are situated at the origin so we do nt concern ourselves over other equivalent vectors .",

    "it is the unit circle @xmath13 where diametrically opposed points are made identical , i.e. @xmath14 as a physical realization of this set , we immediately think of the compass without considering the sense , i.e , by identifying north with south , east with west , .... , or even better , to the familiar protractor shown in figure [ protractor ] .",
    "is clearly apparent on the picture , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc , sign minus being attributed to the internal graduation.,width=480 ]    the true compass orientations @xmath17 senses are described by the unit circle itself . in order to avoid notational complications , we consider in this paper states as elements of the latter , keeping in mind the possibility to view as equivalent two diametrically opposed points .",
    "now , multiplying a unit vector or a ray by a real number has a deep signification both in euclidean geometry as in quantum formalism , since it lies at the heart of the superposition principle , which states that any linear combination of two vectors is a vector , and that a new unit vector or ray is built from this vector , if it is not zero , by dividing it by its length .",
    "an appreciable part of the material presented here is borrowed from references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ r2dirac ]",
    "we briefly recall the definition of hilbert space before rewriting the language of euclidean geometry by using _ bra _ and _ ket _ dirac notations .",
    "we then describe _ pure _ or _ mixed _ states , and symmetric @xmath18 matrices as observables in these real hilbert spaces . in section [ intquant ]",
    "we proceed with the integral quantization of the circle , after a rapid survey of the method .",
    "this method allows us to give in a straightforward way the quantum counterparts of classical models such as functions ( and even distributions ) defined on the circle .",
    "some probabilistic aspects of the obtained quantum objects and of their _ semi - classical _ portraits are examined in great details .",
    "section [ evolution ] is devoted to the description of a quantum dynamics adapted to our model .",
    "indeed , an adaptation is necessary since we are supposed to use real numbers , vectors and matrices in our quantum formalism , and the latter can not be derived from the quantization of some phase space .",
    "such a classical object does not exist in our formalism , and so our quantum dynamics can not be derived from an hamiltonian system . if we want to use quantum dynamics _",
    " la _ dirac , we are forced to introduce at a certain stage pure imaginary numbers . hence , the most general hamiltonian compatible with the equation ruling the quantum evolution of symmetric @xmath18 real matrices must be a symmetric complex matrix .",
    "on the other hand , we can deal with a formalism using real numbers only and leading to a kind of majorana evolution equation .",
    "then unitary evolution operators are just @xmath18 rotation matrices , as expected in two - dimensional euclidean geometry . in section",
    "[ entanglement ] , we address the question of entanglement of two systems with states in the euclidean plane",
    ". states of such objects are elements of the tensor product @xmath19 .",
    "now , because of the elementary identity @xmath20 , this tensor product is isomorphic to @xmath21 ( and also to @xmath22 ) . since the plane @xmath5 can be also viewed as the complex plane @xmath23 , we get the possibility of understanding initial entangled objects either as elements of the more elementary complex hilbert spaces @xmath2 , e.g. , the space of quantum one - half spins , or as elements of the quaternion field @xmath3 .",
    "this set of possibilities sheds an interesting light on entangled objects viewed as cat states in @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of section [ magnint ] is to give a physical exemple of the quantum hamiltonian appearing in euclidean plane quantum dynamics .",
    "this is done by considering for instance a charged spin one half particle , e.g. , an electron , interacting with a magnetic field with constant direction in the plane .",
    "the demonstration rests upon an integral quantization of the 2-sphere @xmath24 viewed as the phase space with canonical coordinates @xmath25 , where @xmath26 has the meaning of an angular momentum and @xmath27 is the azimutal angle . in section [ conclu ]",
    "we present some interesting perpectives of generalisations of the content of our work , centred on the continuation of the game @xmath28 ( as vector spaces ) with @xmath29 ( as vector spaces ) , the latter cartesian product being given an octonionic structure . in appendix [ pararho ]",
    "we describe different parametrizations of real @xmath30 density matrices together with interesting properties .",
    "quaternions in different languages and their basic properties are described in appendix [ allsu2 ] , by insisting on their @xmath31 representation . in appendix [ unitsphere ]",
    "we present the integral quantization of the @xmath0-sphere which is needed to establish our result in section [ magnint ] .",
    "we first recall that a finite - dimensional hilbert space is a finite - dimensional real or complex vector space @xmath32 equipped with a scalar ( or dot or inner ) product @xmath33 or @xmath23 , between any pair of vectors @xmath34 , @xmath35 , with the following properties @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , in are arbitrary complex or real numbers , and encodes the _ semi - definiteness _ of the scalar product . in the case of real vector space ,",
    "the scalar product is fully symmetric and bilinear .",
    "hence , it is clear that the two - dimensional real vector space equipped with the usual dot product , i.e. the euclidean plane @xmath5 , is the simplest non - trivial hilbert space .",
    "we now adopt the dirac notations for vectors in @xmath5 after restoring the familiar arrow or hat superscripts and boldface symbols .",
    "given the orthonormal basis of @xmath5 defined by the two familiar unit vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as is shown in figure [ r2fig ] , any vector @xmath41 in the plane decomposes as @xmath42 we also use in the sequel the column vector notation to designate @xmath41 with implicit mention of orthonormal basis , @xmath43 in such a way that the dirac _ ket _ and _ bra _ notations become transparent , @xmath44 hence , elementary matrix calculus allows to formulate scalar product and ( orthogonal ) projector in _ bra ket _",
    "( respectively in _ ket bra _ ) notations : @xmath45 since we view the euclidean plane as a space of quantum states , pure states are identified with unit vectors , discarding , as announced in the introduction , the imposed equivalence between opposed senses along the orientation support .",
    "hence , the unit circle @xmath13 in the plane is the natural set of parameters which distinguish these states . to each",
