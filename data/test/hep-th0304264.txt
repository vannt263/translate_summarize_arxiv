    "when the theory is quantized the skyrmions give a good description of nuclei , @xmath5 resonance @xcite and even bound states of nuclei @xcite . a striking feature",
    "is that skyrmions can be quantized as fermions @xcite .",
    "when the theory is coupled to a fermion field two different ways of describing fermions appear in the same theory .",
    "physically , the fermion field can be thought of as light quarks in the presence of atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "hiller calculated the spectrum of the fermions in the background of a skyrmion @xcite .",
    "however , the approximation for the skyrmion configuration was very crude .",
    "the spectrum shows a spectral flow of the eigenvalues depending on the value of the coupling constant .",
    "in particular one mode crosses zero .",
    "this general behaviour has been verified by other authors @xcite . to gain a better understanding we consider a generalization of the model .",
    "since static field configurations in the original skyrme model in flat space are topologically equivalent to maps @xmath6 , the model can be generalized to the base space being a sphere of radius @xmath7 .",
    "the original model is recovered in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath9 and baryon number @xmath10 the faddeev - bogomolny bound is satisfied and the minimal energy solution can be worked out explicitly @xcite . in this case",
    "the map @xmath6 is an isometry . for larger @xmath7 the skyrmions",
    "are localized and tend to the usual flat space skyrmions in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "monopoles and skyrmions have many properties in common , and it is therefore instructive to recall the results for monopoles .",
    "there is an index theorem making use of the bogomolny equations which states that for @xmath11 monopoles there is a @xmath11 dimensional vector space of fermionic zero modes @xcite .",

    "as mentioned above , we make the approximation that the skyrmion is a fixed static background field , _ i.e. _ we ignore the backreaction of the fermion fields .",
    "furthermore , we only consider spherically symmetric skyrmions . for @xmath10 ,",
    "skyrmions are believed to be spherically symmetric , but for @xmath93 this is no longer true .",

    "[ generalization ] .",
    "spherically symmetric skyrme fields are best written in polar coordinates @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the `` radial '' shape function and @xmath96 is the normal vector in @xmath97-direction , see ( [ unitvectors ] ) .",
    "the shape function @xmath95 can be calculated by solving the euler - lagrange equation of the skyrme lagrangian numerically . however , instead of using a numerical solution it is more convenient in this context to approximate @xmath95 by an explicit function .",

    "the value @xmath101 corresponds to the @xmath102-symmetric ansatz of the previous section , whereas for @xmath103 , or @xmath104 , the skyrme field is localized at the south pole , or the north pole , respectively .",
    "manton also showed that for @xmath105 the stable solution is @xmath101 .",
    "finally , we can write down the dirac equation for fermions coupled to a spherically symmetric background skyrmion . it is given by @xmath106 using the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath107 using the coordinates @xmath16 . here",
    "the skyrmion gives rise to    @xmath108    and the same equation holds in the coordinate system @xmath16 .",

    "in this section we solve the dirac equation which has been derived in the previous section for various shape functions @xmath95 . however , first we review some basic facts about ordinary differential equations and regular singular points , following @xcite .",

    "the solution @xmath177 with exponent @xmath193 is always uniformly convergent in some neighbourhood of @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , we reduce equation ( [ diffeq ] ) to a differential equation of first order by setting @xmath194 .",
