    "the properties of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in lower - dimensional geometries , when the particles motion is tightly confined to zero point oscillations in one or two directions , have attracted much attention @xcite-@xcite because of specific coherence properties of degenerate bose gases in lower dimensions and possible experimental realization of quantum gases beyond mean field approach . in order to realize a one - dimensional ( 1d ) condensate , optical dipole traps",
    "have been used to achieve necessary asymmetry between the trapping frequencies ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) condensates have been created in an array of pancake - shaped traps formed by the periodic potential of a 1d optical lattice @xcite . for large lattice potential depths ,",
    "the motion along the direction of the array is frozen and the condensate is effectively split up into several smaller independent condensates confined in the individual lattice wells .",
    "much experimental information on becs in three - dimensional confining traps has been provided by imaging the density of the atomic cloud after switching off the trap potential . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "evolution of becs in diluted gases is described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the external trap potential , @xmath2 is the nonlinear interaction constant @xmath3 being the @xmath4-wave scattering length of the interacting atoms , and the condensate wave function @xmath5 is normalized to the number of atoms @xmath6 if the number of atoms is large enough , the gp equation can be reduced to the hydrodynamic equations , which admit simple self - similar solutions describing as oscillations of bec in the parabolic trap potential , so its free 3d expansion after switching off the trap potential @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this theory shows excellent agreement with the experiment .    in the recent experiments",
    "the free expansion of bec has been investigated in 1d waveguides @xcite and in the array of 2d pancake becs @xcite , and this line of investigations looks very promising . in @xcite expansion of bec in a waveguide has been considered for quasi-1d case but without taking into account the quantum pressure in transverse direction . in",
    "@xcite the effects of the quantum pressure have been calculated for stationary states with account of two transverse modes and expansion dynamic has been studied numerically . in @xcite stationary states of bec in",
    "cigar - shaped and pancake traps have been considered by means of proper variational approach without discussion of free expansion dynamics .",
    "the aim of this article is to give analytic treatment of the lower dimensional expansion of bec . to this end , under conditions that 3d gp equation can be reduced to its lower dimensional counterparts , in section ii we solve these reduced equations in their hydrodynamic approximations with initial conditions corresponding to the equilibrium states of a confined in the parabolic trap bec with positive scattering length ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "free expansion of bec takes place either in longitudinal direction of the 1d waveguide , or in transverse direction of the 2d pancake trap .",
    "if the conditions of lower dimensional reductions of gp equation are not fulfilled , then effects of 3d hydrodynamic flow can be estimated with the use of variational approach what is done in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to comparison of the theory with experiment .",
    "the gp equations admits formulation in the form of the hamilton least action principle with the action functional @xmath8 where the lagrangian density is given by @xmath9 so that the corresponding lagrange equation coincides with the gp equation ( [ gp ] ) . in cigar - shaped or pancake configurations it is not difficult to determine conditions",
    "when the tightly confined degrees of freedom become irrelevant ( `` frozen '' ) and the gp equation reduces to the effective 1d or 2d equation .",
    "this problem has been considered in many papers ( see , e.g. @xcite , chapter 17 , and references therein ) and we shall present here only the main points with the aim to define the relevant parameters and to formulate the applicability conditions .      if the axial frequency @xmath10 of the axially symmetric trap is much less than its transverse frequency @xmath11 , @xmath12 and characteristic energy of zero - point transverse motion is much greater than the nonlinear energy , then the transverse motion reduces to the ground state of quantum oscillations in the radial trap potential .",
    "characteristic radius of this motion is equal to @xmath13 , and if we denote by @xmath14 the characteristic axial size of the bec , then with account of the estimate @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "( [ norm3 ] ) ) the corresponding condition can be written in the form ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath16 if this condition is fulfilled , then we can factorize the condensate wave function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ground state wave function of the transverse motion .",
    "substitution of ( [ 1d - factor]),([1d - osc ] ) into ( [ action]),([3lagr - density ] ) and subsequent integration over transverse cross section lead to the expression for the action in terms of effective 1d lagrangian density @xmath19 ( irrelevant constant term has been omitted ) .",
    "now the evolution of @xmath20 is governed by lagrange equation which yields the 1d gp equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is effective 1d nonlinear coupling constant and @xmath23 is normalized according to @xmath24 equation ( [ 1d - gp ] ) governs 1d longitudinal dynamics of the bec in cigar - shaped trap .    by means of well - known substitution @xmath25 equation ( [ 1d - gp ] ) transforms to the system @xmath26 @xmath27 the last term in eq .",

    "then eq .",
    "( [ 1d - quantum ] ) reduces to @xmath30 which together with eq .  ( [ 1d - cont ] ) provides the hydrodynamic approximation to description of bec dynamics in parabolic trap potential .",
    "the stationary solution of the hydrodynamic equations gives the well - known thomas - fermi ( tf ) distribution of density for 1d bec : @xmath31 where the integration constant @xmath14 has a meaning of the axial half - length of the condensate and can be expressed in terms of the number of atoms @xmath32 , @xmath33 conditions ( [ 1d - cond1 ] ) and ( [ 1d - cond2 ] ) of applicability of 1d hydrodynamic approximation can be written upon substitution of ( [ z ] ) as ( see @xcite ) @xmath34    now we suppose that the axial trap is turned off , so that bec expands freely in the axial direction . at the same time",
    "it remains being confined in the transverse direction , that is the radial motion is still `` frozen '' to the quantum ground state ( [ 1d - osc ] ) .",
    "hence , this expansion is governed by the hydrodynamic equations ( [ 1d - cont ] ) and ( [ 1d - euler ] ) with the initial conditions ( [ 1d - tf ] ) .",
    "similar problems were studied in nonlinear optics @xcite for the opposite sign of the pressure term @xmath35 in ( [ 1d - euler ] ) and for description of free 3d expansion of bec @xcite .",

    "the formula ( [ vmax - as ] ) is convenient for comparison with experiment since the asymptotic value of the maximal velocity is expressed in terms of two experimentally measurable parameters  the axial frequency @xmath10 of the trap initially confining the bec and the initial half - width @xmath14 of the axial tf distribution .    from ( [ 1d - asymp ] )",
