    "_ , flourish in the literature , and a great deal of attention has been dedicated to the consideration of finer corrections , such as , for instance , terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 that account for shell and pairing effects , respectively , and further correlations .",
    "this work is motivated by the observation that the dominant terms , such as @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 , define a notoriously _ concave _ energy surface .",
    "upper and lower bounds to nuclear binding energies can be deduced from such a concavity , provided that deviations from concavity , possibly induced by subdominant terms like @xmath10 @xmath18 @xmath19 _ etc .",
    "_ , can be corrected . for the sake of simplicity",
    "this paper first considers only sequences of isotopes and , thus , takes advantage of concavity with respect to @xmath6 only ; @xmath7 is frozen . in section 2",
    "we begin with a theory at zero temperature and show how elementary , invertible transformations of data can generate truly concave patterns .",
    "this is obtained by an analysis of the table of second differences between binding energies , then by a removal of the pairing energy , and finally by an _ ad hoc _ , but minimal , parabolic term added to the nuclear energies , if necessary .    since concavity is also a property of several thermodynamical functions , an extension of the zero temperature analysis to finite temperatures",
    "is in order . in section 3",
    "we discuss properties of that grand potential , @xmath20 which can be deduced from the experimental data after their tuning .",
    "other thermodynamical functions are also considered , and their concavity is tested .",
    "bounds are found , and an error bar for predictions is estimated .    a generalization to concavity with respect to both @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "is briefly studied in section 4 .",
    "an additional motivation for our investigation of concavity properties is the need , in density functional theories , of concavity , if the universality @xcite of a density functional must be obtained",
    ". a solution will be shown .",
    "finally , a discussion and conclusion are given in section 5 .",
    "our argument is best illustrated numerically , by using a sequence of isotopic ground - state binding energies , @xmath21 we choose to work with the tin isotopes ( sn ) , because they provide a large number of known isotopes for testing our method .",
    "in addition , in section 3 , we will extend our approach to finite temperatures using a grand potential , which requires that a sufficiently large number of excited states are also known .",
    "for instance , a table of @xmath22 ground - state bindings for the tin isotopes from @xmath23sn to @xmath24sn reads , in kev ,    \\ { 934571 , 942744 , 953531 , 961274 , 971574 , 979120 , 988684 , 995627 , 1004954 , 1011438 ,   1020546 ,   1026716 ,   1035529 ,   1041475 ,   1049963 , 1055696 , 1063889 , 1069439 , 1077345 , 1082676 , 1090293 , 1095540 , 1102851 , 1105320 , 1109239}. despite a standard linear trend because of a `` not too much fluctuating average energy per nucleon '' , this list is not making a smooth pattern , even less of a concave one . the full line in fig .",

    "the main source of irregularity is , obviously , the pairing effect .",
    "if it can be removed , concavity emerges .",
    "concavity for a sequence of isotones is not a surprise , because of the @xmath28 nature of the coulomb term . for a sequence of isotopes ,",
    "however , there is no such obviously quadratic term available , notwithstanding the empirical modelization of a symmetry energy @xmath29 our choice of sn , because of its long isotope sequence , illustrates this concavity more dramatically .",
    "most energies stated in this paper are in units of kev .",
    "our data come from ref .",
    "@xcite . see also @xcite .",
    "these sources usually quote the binding energy per nucleon instead of the total binding energy itself and such values per nucleon are given to varying numbers of significant figures , from six to seven for the sn isotopes @xcite that we consider .",
    "consequently , we quote and use all our binding energies to six or seven significant figures . our values are generally accurate to the order of two to three kev near the center of the sequence , and tens of kev at both ends for the sn isotopes .",

    "other choices for @xmath48 are possible , but , obviously , within a small range around @xmath49 and @xmath50 furthermore , such parameters must be readjusted for different regions of the table of nuclei , but it is again obvious that readjustments will be moderate ; for instance , the order of magnitude for pairing will always be around @xmath51 to @xmath52 mev . analyzing short sequences",
    "obviously leaves fewer negative sds to be compensated by the artificial , parabolic term , and , hence should induce smaller values of @xmath53 for this reason , we would expect short sequences to give often better extrapolations .",
    "once concavity is obtained , it is straightforward that extrapolations from two points on the concave pattern allow predictions of lower bounds to nuclear energies and interpolations give upper bounds",
    ". then , from such bounds for energies @xmath54 one recovers bounds , of strictly the same quality , for the physical energies @xmath55 this obtains by subtracting from each @xmath56 bound its `` tuning term '' .",
    "assume now that @xmath23sn were unknown and one had done a brute force extrapolation , @xmath57 compared with @xmath58 this prediction underbinds @xmath23sn by @xmath59 kev .",
    "consider rather @xmath60 to be compared with @xmath61 a slight overbinding , by 36 kev , is found .",
    "although this small error is likely accidental , it is clear that systematic lower bounds will be found .",
    "naturally , once a value for @xmath47 is predicted , one recovers as good an estimate for @xmath25 after removing the `` concavity manipulation terms '' , which are known explicitly . in the present case ,",

    "based on the data in @xcite , the experimentally measured energy for @xmath23sn has an error bar @xmath66 kev ; hence , in this case , the experimental error bar and the uncertainty in our theoretical value have the same order of magnitude .",
    "if @xmath35sn were unknown , the brute force extrapolation gives , @xmath67 to be compared with @xmath68 showing an underbinding equal to @xmath69 kev , clearly failing to reproduce the shell closure effect .",
    "now , from the concave pattern , we obtain @xmath70 to be compared with @xmath71 producing an overbinding by @xmath72 kev .",
    "the same overbinding is obviously found if one subtracts from @xmath70 the tuning difference , @xmath73 with the result , @xmath74 to be compared with @xmath75 see fig .",
    "4 , which also illustrates an extrapolation using @xmath76 and @xmath77 and an interpolation using @xmath78 and @xmath76 .    let us now also compare for an odd rather than even isotope , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath79sn , two extrapolations and one interpolation from raw data and concave data , respectively . with our choice of parameters , the tuning difference ,",
    "@xmath80 is @xmath81 with @xmath82 extrapolations from lower masses give , @xmath83 and @xmath84 hence , overbindings of @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively . extrapolations from higher masses give , @xmath87 and @xmath88 leading to overbindings of @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "interpolations from the nearest nuclei give , @xmath91 and @xmath92 with now overbinding of @xmath93 and underbinding of @xmath94 respectively .",
    "the poor results from raw data stress the importance of pairing corrections .",
    "the much better results from the concave pattern do take this pairing into account , but , furthermore , they again make it trivial that extrapolations give overbindings , while interpolations give underbindings .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we now consider a case with a two - step extrapolation .",
    "if the tuned pattern followed a perfect parabolic form , @xmath95 the formula , @xmath96 predicts , for the lower bound , an error which is a little larger than desirable .",
    "this is because of the coefficient , @xmath97 and the fact that the `` curvature parameter '' , @xmath98 has here an order of magnitude in the few hundred kev range , see those residual second differences used for the dashed curve in fig .",
    "this indicates that further stages of the theory , with polynoms at least , are worthy of consideration .",
    "however , to remain within the `` linear '' scope of the present paper , we give the results obtained for @xmath99sn , @xmath100 and @xmath101sn , @xmath102 when we use the lower bound estimates from the formula , @xmath103 from ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictions , which are based on neighbor nuclei with the same @xmath7 and @xmath6 parities , are @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively , with error bars of @xmath106 mev .",
    "we do find a lower bound for @xmath99sn , with apparently a severe , but mostly expected , error of a couple of mevs .",
    "for @xmath101sn , we apparently fail to generate a lower bound , but by so small a difference that our results stay well inside the error bars .    to summarize section 2 ,",
    "when concavity occurs , one concludes that extrapolations from two points on the concave pattern allow predictions of lower bounds to nuclear energies . in the same way",
    ", interpolations provide upper bounds .",
    "the quality of such `` concavity bounds '' from zero temperature data is found to be good ; interpolations and extrapolations from the raw , nonconcave pattern , are clearly less satisfactory .",
    "but there is a more profound reason why a concave pattern is necessary . indeed ,",
    "several thermodynamical functions , governed by theorems proving their concavity , have a notoriously singular limit at zero temperature : they become nonanalytical and are just piecewise continuous .",
    "their limit plots are made of segments ; derivatives are discontinuous at turning points .",
    "because of the staggering effect , the _ concave envelope _ of the raw pattern of @xmath25 s would contain only the even isotopes .",
    "concavity is , thus , _ necessary _ for a theory that must accommodate both odd and even nuclei .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamical functions studied in section 3 preferably use concave energies @xmath47 and the corresponding excited state energies @xmath107",
    "consider the particle number operator @xmath108 and a familiar nuclear hamiltonian @xmath109 where @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the mass number , one - body kinetic energy and two - body interaction , respectively .",
    "nuclear data tables @xcite give precise values for a large number of lowest - lying eigenvalues @xmath113 of @xmath114 for many nuclei .",
    "one may , thus , reasonably estimate the grand partition function , @xmath115 = \\sum_{na } ( 2 j_{na}+1 )   \\exp\\left [ \\beta \\left ( \\mu a - e_{na } \\right )   \\right ] , \\label{definz}\\ ] ] provided that i ) the temperature , @xmath116 is low enough to allow a truncation of the spectrum to include only those states provided by the tables and ii ) the chemical potential , @xmath117 selects mainly those nuclei in which we are interested",

    "the monotonicity results from eq .",
    "( [ fluca ] ) . actually ,",
    "at low temperatures , strong derivatives signal the onset of discrete jumps due to the integer spectrum of @xmath142 but we may stay away from this `` jumpy '' regime in the following , at least temporarily .",

    "furthermore , such `` negativity accidents '' turn out to be worse when we use untuned data , maybe because the untuned data lack concavity in the first place .",
    "a likely reason for the negativity accidents with tuned data might be that the fluctuation of @xmath108 is not large enough to justify our use of @xmath195 as a continuous variable .",

    "indeed , for , e.g. @xmath199 kev , we found that the fluctuation is smaller than @xmath200 for almost half of the calculated values of @xmath201    at this stage , the situation can be summarized as follows . on the one hand ,",
    "the tuned pattern of experimental energies shows concavity , but the concavity of @xmath180 as a function of @xmath195 is not sure , although it seems to occur most of the time .",

    "7 .    a compromise may be found so that @xmath140 is low enough to make @xmath205 small with respect to @xmath181 and high enough to ensure both sufficient values of @xmath206 and a tolerable oscillating of @xmath207 our rationale will be that @xmath173 even though it might deviate from concavity , will stay close enough to the concave @xmath208 their difference , @xmath209 a positive quantity , will define an error bar between a lower bound @xmath181 and an upper bound @xmath180 for ground - state tuned energies .",
    "consider again fig .",
    "5 . there is no need to stress how , given @xmath135 the energy and free energy curves make a band defining upper and lower bounds for the experimental energies .",
    "moreover , a similar , but narrower band is obtained if @xmath140 decreases . figs . 5 , 6 and 8 suggests @xmath210 kev for an error bar @xmath169 kev between energy and free energy , a smooth enough entropy energy and a sufficient fluctuation of the particle number .",
    "this order of magnitude for @xmath140 is compatible with the average level splitting , of order @xmath211 kev , that is observed from the first 10 levels of @xmath23sn , ... , @xmath35sn used in our calculations .",
    "the following properties , i ) the average energy and the free energy are increasing and decreasing , respectively , functions of increasing @xmath135 ii ) the energy is larger than the free energy and iii ) the entropy term by which they differ vanishes when @xmath140 vanishes , are not big surprises .",
    "it can be concluded that , in so far as thermodynamical functions can be calculated at low enough temperatures , precise `` accuracy bands '' may be available . their , hopefully analytic , continuation for higher and/or lower values of @xmath0 than those available in nuclear tables provides a prediction scheme for exotic nuclei .",
    "an estimate of the entropy term is now useful . given @xmath133 and a _",
    "@xmath143 let @xmath212 and @xmath213 correspond to that nucleus whose ground - state energy maximizes the exponential , @xmath214.$ ] consider now the first subdominant exponential .",
    "it might be generated by the first excited state of the same nucleus , or by the ground - state of one of its neighbors .",
    "let @xmath215 and @xmath216 be its parameters and define @xmath217 concavity guarantees that @xmath218 whenever @xmath132 is large enough , it is trivial to reduce the grand canonical ensemble to a two state ensemble , and the entropy then boils down to @xmath219 hence , the product , @xmath220 vanishes exponentially fast when @xmath221 the rate of decrease is governed by that scale defined by @xmath222 to be extracted from the tuned data .",
    "then one can estimate an order of magnitude for the difference between the free energy and the energy .",
    "this estimate can be viewed as an error bar for the prediction of exotic nuclei via the present `` concavity method '' .",
    "we have applied the approach to several other isotopic regions , such as sm , hg , pb . in all cases , making the switch to the concave shape improves our ability to make extrapolations and interpolations for unknown bindings . however , estimating the free energy and the average value of @xmath114 to set narrow upper and lower bounds on these binding energies , remains more difficult in drip line regions , because of the lack of experimental data on excited states in such regions .",
    "very simple linear extrapolations still provide , nonetheless , error bars with an order of magnitude @xmath223 kev , similar to the best `` band '' seen in fig .",
    "a few examples of the kind of results that we can obtain from this thermodynamical error - bar analysis , when using the method described in sec . 2 , are these conservative estimates of the bindings of @xmath224hg , @xmath225hg and @xmath226hg , namely @xmath227 mev @xmath228 kev , @xmath229 mev @xmath228 kev and @xmath230 mev @xmath228 kev , respectively .",
    "we now want to consider binding - energy systematics in two dimensions , _",
    "i.e. , _ n and z. the second differences studied in this section are , @xmath231 @xmath232 @xmath233 and @xmath234 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 were continuous , and , furthermore , if @xmath235 were a smooth function of @xmath6 and @xmath236 the numbers , @xmath237 @xmath238 @xmath239 and @xmath240 might be interpreted as estimates of second derivatives of the function @xmath241 in the neutron , proton , constant @xmath242 and constant @xmath0 directions , respectively .",
    "their connections with neutron , proton and p - n pairings and with a symmetry energy are also transparent .",
    "setting aside what we consider to be `` light '' nuclei , namely those of the s- , p- , sd- and f@xmath243 shells , we calculated these four sds for the rest of the known nuclear table .",
    "their maxima and minima are found to be of order    @xmath244 kev , respectively .",
    "the lhs parts of figs . 9 - 12 show , in scattered plots with respect to @xmath110 the patterns of those sd values .",
    "the negative sds , contradicting concavity , are due mainly to pairing effects .",
    "an extension of the correction done in sec .",
    "2 is in order .",
    "let @xmath245 be a mass dependent @xcite estimate of pairing .",
    "diminish the binding of doubly even nuclei by @xmath245 , increase the binding of doubly odd ones by @xmath246 and leave odd nuclei untouched .",
    "we set , empirically , @xmath247 there is no doubt that better parametrizations of @xmath245 are possible @xcite , but the present linear decrease suffices for our demonstration . with this correction ,",
    "the worst sds become    @xmath248 kev , respectively . as expected , this is a large reduction of both positive and negative amplitudes .",
    "this is shown by the rhs parts of figs .",
    "9 - 12 , respectively .",
    "while the pairing correction has not completely suppressed negative sds , note the worst minimum is still of order @xmath249 kev , concavity has been improved significantly and extrapolations are likely made more secure .",
    "similar to our one - dimensional analysis in sec . 2 , one can now add to the energies a paraboloid term , of the form , @xmath250 in order to get rid of the residual , negative sds .",
    "( we recall that sds do not depend on @xmath251 and @xmath252 which are only parameters for graphical and/or numerical convenience . )",
    "notice from fig .",
    "12 , and the corresponding worse minimum , of order @xmath253 kev , that the direction where @xmath0 is constant does not deviate much from concavity .",
    "the dominant term in the paraboloid must , therefore , indicate a direction approximately orthogonal , and also take into account the bend of the global stability valley towards neutron excess .",
    "there is , furthermore , no doubt that the two - dimensional free energy , now a function of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 made continuous by a grand canonical ensemble , remains a concave function , available for lower bounds .",
    "this is a theorem , which can be proven in a straightforward manner following the previous derivation for one dimension .",
    "simultaneously , it is likely that the mean energy will be again `` almost concave '' , to yield upper bounds , in which case the same error bar that was estimated in sec .",
    "3 remains valid .",
    "a systematic use of such properties throughout the nuclear table is way beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "rather , we want to discuss the relation of concavity with the derivation of a nuclear density functional .",
    "recall that , given an arbitrary many - body density matrix @xmath254 in fock space , the density functional derives from the definition @xcite , @xmath255={\\rm inf}_{{\\cal m } \\rightarrow \\rho_p,\\rho_n }   { \\rm tr}\\ , { \\bf h}\\ , { \\cal m}.\\ ] ] here the symbol , @xmath256 means that a minimization of the energy is performed upon density matrices having the same neutron and proton profiles @xmath257 a nucleus is identified by the integrals , @xmath258 and @xmath259 and a later minimization is performed with respect to the profiles @xmath260 under such identification constraints , @xmath261.\\ ] ] the functional @xmath262 should be universal , in the nuclear physics sense .",
    "namely , it should not depend on @xmath6 and @xmath263 ( in atomic and molecular physics , universality of the df has a different meaning ; it refers to arbitrary external potentials . ) while bcs and hartree - bogoliubov calculations allow a distinction between even and odd particle numbers , universality in density profile space does not allow such a separate treatment .",
    "observe , furthermore , that , because of the fact that there are many convexities in the pattern of raw energies , there exist many cases where , for instance , three nuclei , @xmath264 are such that @xmath265 and @xmath266 and @xmath267 then , in a search for @xmath268 the mixture density matrix , @xmath269 but an absurd energy , lower than @xmath270 concavity is a _ mandatory condition _ for the universality of @xmath271    one way to simultaneously implement pairing corrections and use a minimal paraboloid term consists in adding to the physical @xmath272 terms such as , @xmath273 + u\\ , { \\bf n}^2 + 2v\\ , { \\bf n}\\ , { \\bf z } + w\\ , { \\bf z}^2.$ ] ( notice how the cosines take advantage of the continuous nature of @xmath274 and @xmath275 at finite temperatures . ) concavity is achieved if @xmath276 are tuned to compensate for the worst tuned sd minima listed above , namely @xmath277 a rough solution consists in taking @xmath278 and a `` circular '' ansatz , @xmath279 with @xmath280 but less brutal solutions are obviously worthy of consideration , in order to minimize this tampering with the hamiltonian . in any case , we stress that the operators , @xmath281 and @xmath282 commute with @xmath272 , and , therefore , that the present counterterms do not perturb nuclear dynamics . once again we emphasize that this approach _ unifies _ the treatment of odd and even nuclei . the fact that the nuclear density functional needs to originate from a hamiltonian , completed by such counterterms , illustrates how important concavity is for making predictions for nuclei far from stability , _",
    "i.e. , _ for the so - called exotic nuclei .",
    "we have demonstrated how a list of ground - state energies for a sequence of isotopes can be turned into a concave pattern .",
    "this involves simple manipulations ; for instance , an explicit term , accounting for pairing in even nuclei , can be subtracted from the bindings .",
    "this unifies the treatment of odd and even nuclei , a notoriously difficult problem .",
    "if needed , a small quadratic correction can also be added to guarantee concavity at all points along the sequence .",
    "similar arguments leading to concavity clearly hold for isotones as well , and , furthermore , for any other sequence of neighboring nuclei in any direction across the nuclear table .",
    "once this empirical tuning has been implemented , linear ( or more general ) extra- and interpolations of the concave pattern can provide surprisingly accurate and robust estimates of , or bounds for , binding energies .",
    "these tuning terms , which are added to induce concavity , are , of course , subtracted _ in fine_.    this work then defined a more ambitious extra- and interpolation scheme , involving thermodynamical functions from a grand canonical ensemble , because such functions may have rigorous concavity properties .",
    "theorems are , indeed , available to prove such properties . for instance , the free energy is a concave function of the average particle number and is also a decreasing function of the temperature .",
    "we also found strong numerical evidences concerning the average energy .",
    "this average energy at nonzero temperature turns out , in general , to be a concave function of the average particle number , except for `` minor accidents , '' which depend upon the temperature .    for",
    "every given , finite temperature , we found that the average energy and the free energy , as functions of the average particle number , give upper and lower bounds , respectively , for the concave envelope of the ground - state energies .",
    "when the temperature vanishes , both bounds converge to the exact results . at this vanishing temperature , however , the analyticity of such thermodynamical functions is lost , because their limit is only piecewise continuous .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to retain a minimum temperature if one wants to obtain practical extrapolations for the prediction of exotic nuclei .",
    "a minimum amount of particle number fluctuation is necessary to validate the conversion of particle number , an initially discrete quantity , into a continuous variable .",
    "we , therefore , implemented numerical estimates of several thermodynamical functions at moderate temperatures , a few hundred kev at most .",
    "this yields a first result , namely a `` band '' , enclosing ground - state energies between the average energy and the free energy .",
    "the width of the band defines an error bar which can be trusted when extrapolations are made .",
    "a difficulty arises , however , because of an insufficient number of excited states for nuclei at both ends of any sequence of isotopes .",
    "these excited - state energies are essential for calculating a meaningful value of the average energy for any value of a. more often , only the ground - state energy is known for such neutron very rich or neutron very poor nuclei .",
    "the calculation of the average and free energies is , thus , possible only in an interval smaller than the interval of masses where ground states are known .",
    "two tactics are then available , namely i ) an extrapolation only of the sequence of ground - state energies and ii ) an extrapolation of the thermodynamical functions , starting from a smaller interval .",
    "we found that the first tactic , namely at zero temperature , is reliable , especially when completed by the error bar derived from the finite temperature considerations .",
    "this work also tested the second tactic , with some success but with the limitation due to the lack of known excited states .",
    "the lack leads to edge effects in the calculation of thermodynamical functions . therefore ,",
    "if linear , or polynomial , or more general analytical fits of such thermodynamical functions are attempted , it is better to restrict them from a slightly smaller mass interval",
    ". then , extrapolations should be reliable within one and maybe two mass units towards drip lines .",
    "we can make the strong conclusion that the combination of concavity and extrapolations of thermodynamical functions gives a systematic set of upper and lower bounds for the prediction of ground - state energies .",
    "our last , and perhaps most important result , is the connection between concavity and the universality of the density functional . in a two - dimensional analysis , we showed that a paraboloid term with respect to the proton and neutron number operators _ must _ be added to the hamiltonian , so as to guarantee obtaining consistent energy minima everywhere in density space .",
    "this term can be made minimal if counterterms for pairing are also added .",
