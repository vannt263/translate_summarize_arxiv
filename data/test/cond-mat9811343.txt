    ", such a ` transverse ' van der waals force is also present in an electron gas : while the longitudinal repulsive interaction is screened on the thomas - fermi length , the transverse attractive interaction of the van der waals type due to fluctuating currents survives at long distances ( and in principle induces a superconducting instability ) .",
