    "the application of the general relativity on the description of astrophysical objects has been matter of interest in the theoretical physics .",
    "exact solutions to the einstein field equations with spherical symmetry are of great relevance if systems like stars , planets or spherical clusters are considered .",
    "now , in order to model systems like galaxies , accretion disks or rotating black holes , axially symmetric solutions must be considered . for the case of galaxies ,",
    "the first disks models in general relativity were proposed by bonnor and sackfield in 1968 @xcite and the second one by morgan and morgan in 1969 @xcite .",
    "these solutions increased the interest in this kind of solutions , and later , many other solution were proposed : solutions for static sources are presented in @xcite , while disks with a rotational motion ( stationary ) are presented in @xcite .    the study of the gravitational field produced by an astrophysical source , from the point of view of general relativity , has been a difficult task due to the nonlinear nature of the einstein equations . the situation is not better when we try to find solutions that describe the gravitational field of a system consisting of two or more parts .",
    "examples of this kind of systems are the galaxies because they have ( in general ) a disk , a galactic halo , a bulb , and in many cases , a central black hole .",
    "the case of a disk immersed in a galactic halo is interesting because the halo is the largest and most massive part of a galaxy .",
    "this problem has already been treated by vogt and letelier in @xcite and by gutirrez , gonzlez and quevedo in @xcite . in the first paper",
    "the authors apply the displacement , cut and reflect method to some known disk - like solutions in order to generate disks with haloes , and in the second paper the authors present a new family of disk - like solutions with halo for a conformastatic spacetime in einstein - maxwell gravity .",
    "in this paper we present two families of axially symmetric thin disks of dust immersed in a spheroidal halo .",
    "the disks are obtained from solutions of the einstein equations for an axially symmetric conformastatic spacetime in which the metric tensor is characterized only by one metric function . by introducing a finite discontinuity on the first derivatives of the metric tensor ,",
    "solutions with a singularity of the delta function type are obtained , so describing thin disks .",
    "the nonzero components of the energy - momentum tensor , both for the disk and the halo , are obtained from the einstein equations . in this way ,",
    "the energy densities and pressures of the sources are determined . by imposing the fulfillment of all the energy conditions we obtain a constraint over the solutions , in such a way that the metric function can be properly expressed in terms of a solution of the laplace equation . by using the solution to laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates",
    "we find infinite disks and by using the solution to laplace equation in oblate spheroidal coordinates we find finite disks . in both cases",
    "we obtain particular solutions with energy densities and pressures well behaved everywhere .",
    "we also show that the masses of de disks and the haloes are finite .",
    "finally we solve the geodesic equation for circular orbits in the plane of the disk .",
    "some preliminaries results of this work have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the structure of this article is the follow : in section [ sec : sols ] we solve the einstein equations for a conformastatic metric in order to find the energy density and stress of the halo in terms of solutions to the laplace equation . in section [ sec : emtensor ] we apply the thin shell formalism to find a disk - like source that satisfy the energy conditions ( physically well behaved ) . in section [ sec : mass ]",
    "we introduce the gravitational mass , both for the disk and for the halo , and we study the dynamics of a particle moving in circular orbits in the plane of the disk in order to obtain the rotational curves , which describe the radial dependency of the speed of a particle that moves in circular paths around the center of the galaxy and in the plane of the disk .",
    "we then present , in section [ sec : kuzmin ] , a particular family of relativistic solutions of infinite thin disks with halo and we analyze the behavior of the physical properties and , in section [ sec : morgan ] , we present a second family of solutions of finite thin disks with halo and discuss the physical features of this solutions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concluding ] , we present a brief discussion of our main results .",
    "in order to formulate the einstein field equations for an axially symmetric static spacetime with an infinitesimally thin discoidal source which is immersed in a fluid or matter halo , we first introduce the cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "now , we consider the spacetime as described by the conformastatic metric @xcite @xmath2 where we demand @xmath3 to be a continuos function of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 coordinates . the einstein field equations for this metric yield the energy - momentum tensor for the halo fluid @xmath5 , whose non - null components are    [ e0116 ] @xmath6    now , to give a physical interpretation to the energy - momentum tensor of the halo , we write @xmath5 in a locally minkowskian reference frame whose space - like vectors are oriented in the main stresses directions .",
    "this reference frame is described by the orthonormal basis ,    [ e0116 ] @xmath7    where @xmath8 . by writing @xmath5 in this reference frame , we find the energy density @xmath9 the main stresses of the halo , which are given by @xmath10 and the isotropic pressure @xmath11 which is defined as the average of the main stresses .",
    "the physical quantities we have already obtained depend on the unknown metric function @xmath3 , so we need an additional equation to get @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we demand @xmath12 and @xmath13 to satisfy the energy conditions @xcite , then we get the inequality @xmath14 these conditions are important to yield physically well behaved solutions , in other words , to fulfill the minimum conditions for gravitational systems .",
    "one way to satisfy ( 7 ) is considering @xmath3 functions that are solutions to the equation @xmath15 with @xmath16 . this particular choice to fulfill the energy conditions leads us to the state equation @xmath17 for the halo . here",
    "we can see that the pressure and the energy density are linearly related by a constant @xmath18 that depends on @xmath19 value .",
    "it means that a specific kind of fluid in the halo depends on a particular choice of @xmath19 ; for example , if @xmath19 tends to infinity , then @xmath13 tends to zero and the fluid in the halo would be made of dust .",
    "if we choose @xmath19 equal to 1 , then the state equation would describe a fluid made of radiation .",
    "henceforth , we will not analyze the behavior of @xmath13 , because it is related @xmath12 via the state equation .",
    "now , in order to get solutions for the @xmath3 function , we rewrite equation ( [ eq8 ] ) as @xmath20 in such a way that solutions for @xmath3 can be obtained form solutions of the laplace equation .",
    "furthermore , as the spacetime needs to be asymptotically flat , then @xmath21 has to be @xmath22 at infinity , and we can write @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 es any solution of the laplace equation that vanishes at infinity .",
    "this relation allows us to write @xmath12 in terms of @xmath24 as @xmath25 it is clear that we can obtain different solutions depending on the choice of @xmath24 ; nevertheless , in the next section we will see that @xmath24 must satisfy some conditions in order to have a disk solution .",
    "in the preceding section we computed the energy - momentum tensor for the fluid in the halo ; now , we want to compute the one of the disk . to accomplish this objective we use the distributional approach @xcite and the thin shells formalism @xcite to describe the disk - like source .",
    "mathematically the disk is described by an hypersurface @xmath26 whose function is @xmath27 and its normal vector is @xmath28 .",
    "this hypersurface separates the spacetime in two regions : @xmath29 ( above @xmath26 ) and @xmath30 ( bellow @xmath26 ) . by using distributional functions ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the heaviside function , @xmath33 is the dirac function , @xmath34 is the energy - momentum tensor in @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the energy - momentum tensor in @xmath26 .    now , to describe properly a surface layer it is necesary to satisfy the condition of continuity of the metric across the plane @xmath37 , which is mathematically expressed via the jump function as @xmath38=g_{\\alpha\\beta}|_{_{z=0^{+}}}-g_{\\alpha\\beta}|_{_{z=0^{-}}}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq14}\\ ] ] this condition can be set in terms of the solution to laplace equation through ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) as @xmath39 we also need to ensure that @xmath40 is discontinuous in the plane @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath41=2g_{\\alpha\\beta , z}|_{_{z=0^{+}}}\\neq 0 .",
    "\\label{eq16b}\\ ] ] with the metric tensor defined in ( [ eq1 ] ) and the relation ( [ eq10 ] ) it is easy to show that the last condition is satisfied if we choose a function @xmath24 such that @xmath42    on the other hand , we can compute @xmath36 through the expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the part of the ricci tensor associated to @xmath26 . here",
    "it is important to note that @xmath45 by virtue of the condition ( [ eq16b ] ) .",
    "computing @xmath36 we find that its only non - null component is @xmath46 which is evaluated in @xmath47 .",
    "now , the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk is computed from @xmath36 through the integral @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "this integral yield the non - null component of @xmath50 , which we write in the tetrad ( [ e0116 ] ) to interpret it physically as the surface energy density of the disk - like source , @xmath51 this solution can be rewritten in terms of @xmath24 as @xmath52 which is evaluated in @xmath47    as in the previous section , @xmath53 needs also fulfill the energy conditions , but in this case it is easier than before because our disk is made of dust ( @xmath54 ) , i.e. the particles in the fluid are collisionless ; so all the energy conditions are satisfy if @xmath55 here we do not consider the case @xmath56 because it implies @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "once the energy - momentum tensor has been specified , it is possible to compute the total mass of the system . to do it",
    ", we use the komar formulae @xcite , which is written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the normal vector to the space - like hypersurface , @xmath61 is the time - like killing vector , @xmath62 is the determinant of the induced metric and @xmath63 is the volume element . in our case , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .    by using the non null components of @xmath5 and the relation ( [ eq10 ] ) in the komar formulae",
    "we can compute the mass of the halo as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the usual euclidean volume element of the space .",
    "on the other hand , if we take @xmath69 in the komar formulae we find that the mass of the disk is @xmath70 finially , the total mass of the system is given by @xmath71 .",
    "now , we can also study the movement of a particle in a spacetime described by the line element ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the particle is interacting with a gravitational field produced by a disk - like distribution of energy ( [ eq20s ] ) surrounded by a halo whose energy distribution is described by ( [ eq10u ] ) .",
    "now , a very simple case is the one of a particle that moves in a circular orbit in the plane of the disk ( @xmath37 ) , with velocity @xmath72 tangential to its path .",
    "this is interesting , from the physical point of view , because we have observational information for @xmath73 from spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the relation between the tangential velocity and the distant from the center of the galaxy ( @xmath4 ) is described by the rotational curves .    for a circular path in the plane of the disk @xmath37 and @xmath4",
    "is constant ; therefore , the velocity is described only by two components , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the angular velocity . by imposing the normalization condition",
    "@xmath76 , we find that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the circular velocity or tangential velocity .",
    "on the other hand , we solve the geodesic equation , @xmath79 to obtain an expression for @xmath72 in terms of the function @xmath24 .",
    "as we saw , the spacetime has time symmetry and axial symmetry , so @xmath80 and @xmath81 are not going to change in @xmath82 , so , the geodesic equation reduces to @xmath83 , and it yield the expression for the tangential velocity , @xmath84 from which we obtain the rotational curves .",
    "the energy density of the halo and the disk , the stress of the halo , the gravitational mass and the circular velocity are the physical properties that describe the disk - halo system .",
    "all these properties are written in terms of the solution to laplace equation @xmath24 . nevertheless , as we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : emtensor ] , @xmath85 needs to satisfy the conditions ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq17u ] ) in order to define a surface energy density in the plane @xmath37 .    to find a particular family of models we choose @xmath24 to be the solution to laplace equation in spherical coordinates @xmath86 .",
    "now , if we use the usual coordinates transformations @xmath87 and @xmath88 , then the condition ( [ eq17u ] ) will not be satisfied because @xmath57 . to solve this problem we use",
    "the displacement , cut and reflect method used by kuzmin ( 1956 ) and toomre ( 1963 ) @xcite to generate disk - like sources in the frame of newtonian gravity .",
    "the method is based on the transformation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a constant . with this",
    ", the function @xmath24 takes the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 are arbitrary constants and @xmath95 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "the solution to the laplace equation presented in ( [ ukuz ] ) allows us to write the energy density of the halo as    @xmath96^{2 } + \\left[\\sum_{l=0}^{n}\\left(a_{l}(l+1)p_{l+1}(\\frac{|z|+a}{r})\\right)/r^{l+2}\\right]^{2}}{\\left[1+\\sum_{l=0}^{n}a_{l}p_{l}(\\frac{a}{r})/r^{l+1}\\right]^{2(k+1)/k } } \\right\\}. \\label{rhokuzmin}\\ ] ]    in a similar way , we can write the energy density of the disk as @xmath97/r_{0}^{l+2}}{\\left[1+\\sum_{l=0}^{n}a_{l}p_{l}(a / r_{0})/r_{0}^{l+1}\\right]^{(k+1)/k } } , \\label{sigmakuzmin}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 .",
