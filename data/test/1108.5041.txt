    "it is well known that ads black branes play a central role in the application of the ads / cft correspondence to various phenomena such as condensed matter physics and fluid dynamics  @xcite . remarkably , the ads / cft correspondence holds in any dimensions . in higher dimensions , however , a natural theory of gravity is not general relativity but lovelock theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the ads / cft correspondence in the context of lovelock theory .    the ads / cft correspondence in lovelock theory has been already discussed in the context of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio .",
    "it is conjectured that the shear viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 , which is called as the kss bound  @xcite .",
    "recently , in the case that the dual gravitational theory is lovelock theory , this ratio has been calculated as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the appropriately normalized second order lovelock coefficient  @xcite .",
    "it seems that the kss bound is violated for a positive @xmath3 .",
    "however , when we take into account the pathologies in ads black branes , @xmath3 must be somewhat restricted .",
    "indeed , there are several works on the causality violation of ads black branes in conjunction with the kss bound  @xcite . clearly , it is important to clarify the pathologies in ads black branes .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the pathologies in ads black brane solutions in lovelock theory , especially in 10-dimensions and 11-dimensions . in recent",
    "work , this issue has been investigated in @xcite based on the master equations derived by us  @xcite .",
    "they used near horizon analysis in the most part of their work and alluded the importance of the bulk geometry based on the numerical results .",
    "however , they have never given general conditions for the occurrence of pathologies . in this paper",
    ", we explicitly present the conditions for the occurrence of pathologies . using the conditions",
    ", we will give a detailed analysis of lovelock ads black branes and discuss its implications in ads / cft .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we review lovelock theory and explain a graphical method of constructing black brane solutions . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we clarify the conditions for avoiding the naked singularity , the ghost instability and the dynamical instability . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we examine the pathologies in ads black branes numerically . in section  [ sec:5 ] , based on the numerical results , we discuss implications of our findings in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the final section  [ sec:5 ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we review lovelock theory and introduce a graphical method of constructing ads black brane solutions .    the most general divergence free symmetric tensor constructed out of a metric and its first and second derivatives has been obtained by lovelock  @xcite . the corresponding lagrangian can be constructed from @xmath4-th order lovelock terms @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the riemann tensor in @xmath7-dimensions and @xmath8 is the generalized totally antisymmetric kronecker delta defined by @xmath9 by construction , the lovelock terms vanish for @xmath10 .",
    "it is also known that the lovelock term with @xmath11 is a topological term .",
    "thus , lovelock lagrangian in @xmath7-dimensions is defined by @xmath12 where we defined the maximum order @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 are arbitrary constants . here , @xmath15 $ ] represents the maximum integer satisfying @xmath15\\leq z$ ] .",
    "taking variation of the lagrangian with respect to the metric , we can derive lovelock equations @xmath16 hereafter , we set @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for convenience .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath21 are dimensionless .",
    "it is well known that there exist static exact solutions of the lovelock equations ( [ eq : eom ] )  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following metric @xmath22 we assume that @xmath23 is negative outside of the horizon . substituting this metric ansatz into eq.([eq : eom ] )",
    ", we can obtain an algebraic equation for @xmath23 : @xmath24\\equiv\\sum_{m=2}^{k}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_m}{m}\\psi^m\\right)+\\psi+1=\\frac{\\mu}{r^{d-1 } }   \\ , \\label{eq : poly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a constant of integration which is related to the adm mass and we assume it is positive .",
    "note that we fixed the scale by setting @xmath26 in eq.([eq : poly ] ) .",
    "now , we explain how to construct solutions using a graphical method .",
    "apparently , @xmath27 must be positive .",
    "in general , there are many branches . in fig.[fig:1 ] , we depicted @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 with @xmath30 fixed in @xmath31 plane .",
    "the intersection of the curve and the line determines @xmath32 once @xmath30 is given . by varying @xmath30",
    ", we obtain the solution of eq.([eq : poly ] ) . taking a look at the metric ( [ eq : solution ] )",
    ", we see that the horizon corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "hence , a black brane corresponds to the branch containing @xmath33 .",

    "it is easy to find singularities",
    ". let us recall the kretschmann invariant which is calculated as @xmath39 if this invariant diverges , there exist singularities .",
    "this occurs at @xmath40 and the point where @xmath41 diverges .",

    "note that the shape of @xmath37 $ ] depends only on lovelock coefficients @xmath21 , so whether a branch has a naked singularity or not is determined by these constants . since we want to avoid the naked singularity , we have to exclude the solutions which have extrema between @xmath46 and @xmath33 .",

    "these solutions should be excluded because they necessarily have the naked singularity .",

    "@xmath0 has been calculated as @xmath67 through ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . note that this depends only on @xmath3 .",

    "it is also possible to apply our results to holographic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "there , the universality for the ratio between the frequency dependent conductivity and the critical temperature is found  @xcite . in gauss - bonnet theory , it is pointed out that this universality in holographic superconductors is violated for a large @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , it is probable that this violation is due to the pathologies discussed in this paper",
    ". it would be interesting to extend holographic superconductors to lovelock theory to clarify this point .",
    "we have discussed the pathologies in ads black branes in lovelock theory , especially in 10-dimensions and 11-dimensions .",
    "we obtained the general conditions for lovelock coefficients @xmath21 that these black branes have the naked singularity , the ghost instability , and the dynamical instability .",
    "it turned out that the dynamical instability could occur away from the horizon in contrast to a naive expectation .",
    "thus , @xmath64 and @xmath62 also control the allowed region of @xmath3 , and consequently changes the lower limit of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also pointed out that the pathologies we have found could affect the interpretation of higher dimensional holographic superconductors .    in this paper",
    ", we did not consider the causality violation discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to take into account the causality violation based on the master equations  @xcite .",
