    "whenever a system can be decomposed into parts , a distinction can be made between collective and relative degrees of freedom .",
    "collective degrees of freedom describe the system s relation to something external to it , while the relative ones describe the relations between its parts . encoding information into collective degrees of freedom is problematic in situations where the parts of the system are subject to an environmental interaction that does not distinguish them ( collective decoherence ) , or if the external reference frame ( rf ) with respect to which they were prepared is unknown , or if a superselection rule applies to the total system  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , encoding information preferentially into the relative degrees of freedom has been shown to offer advantages in these situations , with applications in quantum computation  @xcite , communication  @xcite and cryptography  @xcite .",
    "if the relative encoding is not perfect or is itself subject to some noise , it becomes important to identify measurement schemes for estimating relative parameters .",
    "such measurements have been discussed recently in connection with their ability to induce a relation between quantum systems that had no relation prior to the measurement , e.g. , inducing a relative phase between two fock states  @xcite or a relative position between two momentum eigenstates  @xcite . also , measurements of relative parameters are critical for achieving _",
    "programmable _ quantum measurements  @xcite .",
    "schemes for estimating relative quantum information are also interesting in their own right .",
    "they include such natural tasks as estimating the distance between two massive particles , the phase between two modes of an electromagnetic field , or the angle between a pair of spins . in this paper , we focus on this last example : optimal relative parameter estimation for a rotational degree of freedom given a pair of spin systems .",
    "note that our problem is complementary to that of determining the optimal measurement schemes for estimating _ collective _ parameters for a rotational degree of freedom , a subject of many recent investigations  @xcite .",
    "one scheme for estimating such relative parameters is to measure each system independently with respect to an external rf , e.g. , to perform an optimal estimation of each spin direction and then to calculate the angle between these estimates .",
    "we prove that any such _ local _ scheme , performed using only local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , can not be optimal ; the ability to perform _ joint _ measurements is necessary to achieve the optimum  @xcite .",
    "we also prove that the optimal measurement for estimating a relative angle can be chosen to be rotationally - invariant , demonstrating that an external rf is not required .",
    "we investigate the information gain that can be achieved as different aspects of the estimation task are varied , such as the prior over the relative angle or the magnitude of the spins .",
    "previous studies into parameter estimation have not considered the role of the rf ( implicitly presumed to be classical ) ; our development of relative parameter estimation is appropriate for the case where the rf is itself quantized .",
    "we investigate quantum - classical correspondence of rfs by considering the limit in which one of the spins becomes large , and demonstrate that our optimal relative measurement yields the same information gain in this limit as does the optimal measurement for estimating a spin s direction relative to a classical rf .",
    "interestingly , we also find that the need for joint measurements disappears in this limit .",
    "these results contribute to our understanding of how collective degrees of freedom , which are defined with respect to a classical rf , can be treated as relative ones between quantized systems .",
    "such an understanding is likely to be critical for quantum gravity and cosmology , wherein all degrees of freedom are expected to be relative  @xcite .",
    "consider states in the joint hilbert space @xmath0 of a spin-@xmath1 and a spin-@xmath2 system .",
    "this hilbert space carries a collective tensor representation @xmath3 of a rotation @xmath4 su(2 ) where each system is rotated by the same amount .",
    "we can parametrise the states in @xmath5 by two sets of parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , such that a state @xmath8 transforms under a collective rotation as @xmath9 defining a collective parameter as one whose variation corresponds to a collective rotation of the state , and a relative parameter as one that is invariant under such a rotation , we see that @xmath6 is relative and @xmath7 is collective .    note that a typical parameter will be neither collective nor relative .",
    "however , in situations where a superselection rule for the group of collective transformations applies , or when all systems that can serve as a classical rf for the collective degrees of freedom have been quantized , one finds that all collective parameters become operationally meaningless , and _ all _ observable parameters are relative .    in the special case of two spins",
    "each prepared in an su(2 ) coherent state  @xcite ( discussed below ) , there is only a single relative parameter : the angle between the two spins .",
    "note that this angle can not be perfectly determined by a single measurement ( there exist sets of states with different values of this relative parameter that are nonorthogonal ) and thus we refer to information about this relative parameter as quantum .",
    "suppose that alice prepares a pair of spins in the state @xmath8 and bob wishes to acquire information about the relative parameters @xmath6 without having any prior knowledge of the collective parameters @xmath7 .",
    "the most general measurement that can be performed by bob is a positive operator valued measure ( povm )  @xcite represented by a set of operators @xmath10 . upon obtaining the outcome @xmath11",
    ", bob uses bayes theorem to update his knowledge about @xmath12 from his prior distribution @xmath13 , to his posterior distribution : @xmath14 where @xmath15 assuming that bob has no prior knowledge of @xmath7 , we may take @xmath16 where @xmath17 is bob s prior probability density over @xmath6 and @xmath18 is the su(2 ) invariant measure .",
    "any measure of bob s information gain about @xmath6 can depend only on the prior and the posterior distributions over @xmath6 for every @xmath11 .",
    "the latter are obtained by marginalization of the @xmath19 , and are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 for a given povm @xmath10 , note that any other povm related by a collective rotation ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) yields precisely the same posterior distributions over @xmath6 .",
    "this property also holds true for the povm with elements @xmath23 , which is rotationally - invariant , that is , @xmath24 we define povms that yield the same posterior distribution over @xmath6 to be _ informationally equivalent_. for every povm , there exists a rotationally - invariant povm of the form  ( [ eq : rotinvariantpovm ] ) that is informationally equivalent , and thus it is sufficient to consider only rotationally - invariant povms in optimizing bob s choice of measurement .",
    "these can be implemented without an external rf for spatial orientation .",
    "moreover , they have a very particular form , as we now demonstrate .",
    "the joint hilbert space for the two spins decomposes into a multiplicity - free direct sum of irreducible representations ( irreps ) of su(2 ) , i.e. , eigenspaces @xmath25 of total angular momentum @xmath26 . using schur s lemma  @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that any positive operator satisfying  ( [ eq : rotinvariantpovm ] ) can be expressed as a positive - weighted sum of projectors @xmath27 onto the subspaces @xmath25 , that is , as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . in order to ensure that @xmath30 , we require that @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 is a probability distribution over @xmath11",
    ". the @xmath33 can be obtained by random sampling of the projective measurement elements @xmath34 , and such a sampling can not increase the information about the relative parameters ( quantified by some concave function such as the average information gain ) .",
    "thus , the most informative rotationally - invariant povm is simply the projective measurement @xmath34 .",
    "we have proved the main result of the paper , which can be summarized as follows : if the prior over collective rotations @xmath7 is uniform , then for _ any _ prior over the relative parameters @xmath6 , the maximum information gain ( by any measure ) can be achieved using the rotationally - invariant projective measurement @xmath35 .    a useful way to understand",
    "this result is to note that our estimation task is equivalent to one wherein alice prepares a state @xmath36 ( rather than @xmath8 ) . because the @xmath36 are rotationally - invariant , they are also positive sums of the @xmath37 and",
    "thus may be treated as classical probability distributions over @xmath26 .",
    "the problem reduces to a discrimination among such distributions , for which bob can do no better than to measure the value of @xmath26 .",
    "we now apply this result to several important and illustrative examples of relative parameter estimation .",
    "we shall quantify the degree of success in the estimation by the average decrease in shannon entropy of the distribution over @xmath6  @xcite , which is equivalent to the average ( kullback - leibler ) relative information between the posterior and the prior distributions over @xmath6 , specifically @xmath38 , where @xmath39 { \\rm    d}\\alpha \\,.\\ ] ] we refer to this quantity as simply the _ average information gain_.      the simplest example of relative parameter estimation arises in the context of a pair of spin-1/2 systems .",
    "alice prepares the product state @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the eigenstate of @xmath42 with positive eigenvalue ( note that every state of a spin-1/2 system is an su(2 ) coherent state ) .",
    "bob s task is to estimate the relative angle @xmath43 given no knowledge of the collective orientation of the state .",
    "because the joint hilbert space decomposes into a @xmath44 and a @xmath45 irrep , the optimal povm has the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the projector onto the antisymmetric @xmath48 subspace and @xmath49 is the projector onto the symmetric @xmath50 subspace .",
    "the conditional probability of outcomes @xmath51 and @xmath52 given @xmath6 are simply @xmath53 the average information gain and the optimal guess for the value of @xmath6 depend on bob s prior over @xmath6 .",
    "we consider two natural choices of prior .",
    "this situation corresponds to a prior @xmath54 , yielding @xmath55 , @xmath56 and posteriors @xmath57 upon obtaining the antisymmetric outcome , bob knows that the spins were anti - parallel , whereas upon obtaining the symmetric outcome , they are deemed to be twice as likely to have been parallel than anti - parallel .",
    "we find @xmath58 i.e.  1 bit of information is gained upon obtaining the antisymmetric outcome , and 0.08170 bits for the symmetric outcome . on average ,",
    "bob gains @xmath59 bits of information .      in this case , the prior over @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",

    "the curves ( a),(b ) correspond to the optimal measurement and the optimal local measurement for the case when the spins are prepared parallel or antiparallel with equal probability .",
    "the curves ( c),(d ) correspond to the optimal measurement and the optimal local measurements for the case when the initial direction of each spin is chosen uniformly from the sphere.,width=336 ]      we now consider the estimation of the angle between a spin-1/2 system and a spin-@xmath69 system for some arbitrary @xmath69 , where the latter is in an su(2 ) coherent state @xmath70 ( the eigenstate of @xmath71 associated with the maximum eigenvalue )  @xcite .",
    "alice prepares @xmath72 and bob seeks to estimate @xmath43 .",
    "the joint hilbert space decomposes into a sum of a @xmath73 irrep and a @xmath74 irrep .",
    "the optimal measurement is the two outcome povm @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the projector onto the @xmath77 irrep  . using clebsch - gordon coefficients , the probabilities for each of the outcomes",
    "are found to be @xmath78 we again consider two possible priors over @xmath6 .",
    "a calculation similar to the one for two spin-1/2 systems yields the posteriors @xmath79 using these , we can calculate the average information gain as a function of @xmath69 ; the result is curve  ( a ) of fig .",

    "the @xmath80 value is the average information gain for two spin-1/2 systems , derived previously . in the limit @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "so that the outcome of the measurement leaves no uncertainty about whether the spins were parallel or antiparallel , and the average information gain goes to one bit .",
    "thus , in the limit that one of the spins becomes large , the problem becomes equivalent to estimating whether the spin-1/2 is up or down compared to some classical reference direction , where one expects an average information gain of one bit .",
    "following the same steps as before , the average information gain can be derived as a function of @xmath69 ; the result is curve  ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] . in the limit @xmath81",
    ", we find @xmath84 bits , which is precisely the information gain for the optimal measurement of the angle of a spin-1/2 system relative to a classical direction given a uniform prior over spin directions  @xcite .",
    "consider again the simplest case of a pair of spin-1/2 systems .",
    "the optimal measurement in this case was found to be the povm @xmath85 .",
    "this measurement can not be implemented by local operations on the individual systems because @xmath86 is a projector onto an entangled state .",
    "we now determine the optimal local measurement .",
    "we do so by first finding the optimal separable povm ( one for which all the elements are separable operators ) , and then showing that this can be achieved by locc .",
    "( not all separable povms can be implemented using locc  @xcite . )",
    "the rotationally invariant states for a pair of spin-1/2 systems , called werner states  @xcite , have the form @xmath87 and are known to only be separable for @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "thus , the greatest relative weight of @xmath86 to @xmath89 that can occur in a separable positive operator is @xmath90 .",
    "the closest separable povm to the optimal povm @xmath85 is therefore @xmath91 .",
    "we note that this povm is informationally equivalent to measuring the spin of each system along the same ( arbitrary ) axis and registering whether the outcomes are the same or not , which clearly only involves local operations ( and does not even require classical communication ) . because the povm @xmath91 can be obtained by random sampling of the outcome of @xmath85 , the former is strictly less informative than the latter",
    "indeed , the maximum average information gain with the optimal local measurement is @xmath92 bits for case _ ( 1 ) _ above , and @xmath93 bits for case _ ( 2 ) _ , both strictly less than those obtained for the optimal ( joint ) measurement .",
    "we extend this analysis to the spin-1/2 , spin-@xmath69 case .",
    "consider the following locc measurement .",
    "the spin-@xmath69 system is measured along the complete basis of su(2 ) coherent states @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 points at an angle @xmath97 in some fixed but arbitrary plane .",
    "then , conditional on the outcome @xmath98 of this measurement , the spin-1/2 system is measured along the basis latexmath:[$\\{|\\mathbf{n}_m\\rangle ,    spin-@xmath69 system is then discarded , and all that is registered is whether the outcome for the spin-1/2 system is @xmath100 ; i.e. , whether the two spins are aligned or anti - aligned .",
    "the resulting 2-outcome measurement is informationally equivalent to the rotationally invariant povm @xmath101 by numerically calculating the partial transpose of the operator @xmath102 , the negativity of which is a necessary condition for non - separability  @xcite , we find that @xmath103 is the optimal separable povm .",
    "thus , again , the optimal separable povm can be implemented by locc and gives less information than the optimal ( joint ) measurement .",
    "the average information gain achieved by this measurement , as a function of @xmath69 , in cases _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2 ) _ are plotted as curves ( b ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] .",
    "note that the optimum information gain overall _ can _ be achieved by locc in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "we now briefly discuss some other relative parameter estimation tasks for which our result provides the solution .",
    "the case we have yet to address is the estimation of the angle between a spin-@xmath1 and a spin-@xmath2 system , both in su(2 ) coherent states , for arbitrary @xmath1 , @xmath2 . assuming @xmath105 , the optimal measurement is the @xmath106-element projective measurement which projects onto the subspaces of fixed total angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "the posterior distributions over @xmath6 and the average information gain can be calculated as before , although in this case they are much more complicated . however , in the limit @xmath107 , the clebsch - gordon coefficients simplify , and one can show that the probability of a measurement outcome @xmath26 approaches the probabilities obtained using the born rule for a projective measurement along the classical direction defined by the spin-@xmath2 system .",
    "thus , the posterior distribution for any measurement result will agree with what would be obtained classically , regardless of the prior over @xmath6 . if , in addition , we take @xmath108 , the information gain for @xmath6 becomes infinite ( for any prior distribution ) and thus @xmath6 can be inferred with certainty from the measurement result , as expected for a measurement of the angle between two classical directions . our results also indicate that , in the classical limit , a measurement of the magnitude of total angular momentum should be sufficient to estimate the relative angle , which is indeed the case if the magnitude of each spin is known .",
    "it should be noted that estimating the relative angle between a pair of su(2 ) coherent states is of particular importance because estimating the eccentricity of an elliptic rydberg state of a hydrogen atom is an instance of the same problem  @xcite .",
    "rydberg states are significant because they can be prepared experimentally .",
    "our results imply that an optimal estimation of eccentricity is in fact straightforward to achieve experimentally because it involves only a measurement of the magnitude of the total angular momentum of the atom .",
    "our results are also applicable to systems other than spin .",
    "for example , for _ any _ realization of a pair of 2-level systems ( qubits ) , the degree of nonorthogonality between their states ( measured by , say , the overlap @xmath109 ) is invariant under collective transformations and is thus a relative parameter .",
    "our measurement is thus optimal for estimating this nonorthogonality .",
    "in addition to solving various estimation problems , we have shown that a macroscopic spin in the appropriate limit is equivalent to a classical external rf as far as relative parameter estimation is concerned .",
    "this result suggests that it may be possible to express all measurements ( and possibly all operations ) in a covariant , relative framework that respects the underlying symmetries of the theory .",
    "such a framework is necessary if one wishes to abide by the principle , which has been so fruitful in the study of space and time but has yet to be embraced in the quantum context , that all degrees of freedom must be defined in terms of relations .",
    "there remain many important questions for future investigation .",
    "while we have focussed on estimating relative parameters of product states , one can also consider relative parameters of entangled states , and here the landscape becomes much richer .",
    "for instance , for a pair of spin-1/2 systems , while the set of product states supports a single relative parameter , the set of all two - qubit states supports three : the angle between the spins in a term of the schmidt decomposition  @xcite , the phase between the two terms of this decomposition , and the degree of entanglement .",
    "our measurement scheme is optimal for estimating these relative parameters as well . given the significance of entanglement for quantum information theory , there is likely much to be learned from investigating other sorts of relative quantum information .",
