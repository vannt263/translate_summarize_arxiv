    "it is well recognized that the photoemission process involves an interplay between the bulk and surface phenomena as the excited electron must be ejected from the surface in order to reach the detector .",
    "the intensity measured in an arpes ( angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ) experiment , therefore , fundamentally involves the properties of the relevant initial and final states in the presence of the surface . as a result ,",
    "the arpes intensity can differ greatly from the spectral density of the initial state involved in the excitation .",
    "an understanding of this difference @xmath3 the so - called matrix element effect , is essential for a satisfactory interpretation of the arpes spectra , and this is particularly so in complex materials such as the high - tcs@xcite .",
    "bearing these considerations in mind , we have carried out extensive simulations of the arpes spectra in @xmath4 ( bi2212 , bisco ) within the first - principles band theory framework .",
    "the pristine phase with the body centered tetragonal lattice structure is assumed ; the computationally more demanding case of the orthorhombic and modulated lattices is hoped to be taken up in the future .",
    "we focus on the excitation of states in the vicinity of the fermi energy ( @xmath5 ) around the @xmath1 symmetry point which have been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in the high - tc literature .",
    "for example , the issue of bilayer splitting@xmath3 expected to be relatively large within the conventional lda - based band theory picture at @xmath6 in bisco , has been debated for some time , even though a consensus in favor of the existence of a bilayer splitting appears to be emerging in the recent months@xcite .",
    "the fundamental question has been whether or not strong correlations localize electrons in the @xmath0 layers , yielding a 2d electron gas and a zero bilayer splitting with significant implications for the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates.@xcite this study gives insight into these and related aspects of the ground state electronic structure by delineating the connection between the arpes spectra and the character of the underlying initial and final states .",
    "for this purpose , we have developed the one - step methodology @xcite for modeling the photoemission process so that arbitrarily complex systems with many basis atoms can be treated @xcite .",
    "the previous one - step work has been limited to a maximum of two atoms per unit cell @xcite which is not adequate for the cuprates ; bisco , for example , involves 30 atoms per conventional unit cell even for the pristine lattice . in the one - step approach ,",
    "the interaction of light with the solid is treated as a single quantum mechanical event and the artifical distinctions between the processes of excitation , transport and ejection of the photoelectron invoked in the earlier three - step models @xcite are not made .",
    "the one - step scheme is thus inherently more satisfactory than the three - step model since the surface is incorporated in the latter in an _ ad hoc _ manner . on the other hand",
    ", it often tends to be difficult to identify the behavior of individual transitions within the one - step methodology where the initial and final states must be damped , causing these states to broaden and overlap , blurring distinctions between various transitions .",
    "for this reason , we have also developed the three - step model for complex lattices@xcite .",
    "useful insight is adduced here into different contributions to the arpes spectrum of bisco by examining the momentum matrix element for bulk transitions in the solid in the spirit of the three - step approach .",
    "the specifics of some of the main issues addressed in this article and highlights of the new results presented are as follows .",
    "the dependencies of the arpes intensity on the energy and polarization of the incident light are clarified for the excitation of states near the @xmath6 point .",
    "the response of the antibonding and bonding combinations of states from the @xmath0 bilayers is found to display a strong energy and polarization dependence .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the antibonding and bonding states differs significantly so that by a judicious choice of these experimental parameters even closely placed bilayer bands could be distinguished .",
    "also , photon energies where the intrinsic cross - section for exciting certain states of the pristine lattice is large will be best suited for studying these states ; in contrast , when this cross - section is relatively small , the effects of deviations from the tetragonal symmetry of the system via various distortions and modulations will become more prominent .",
    "further , we show how some systematics of the polarization dependencies can be understood in the cuprates via straightforward arguments involving the symmetries of the initial and final states .    turning to questions related to individual transitions",
    ", we discuss the nature of the momentum matrix element for bulk excitations within a three - step type model in terms of contributions from various basis atoms and different angular momentum channels .",
    "the character of the bonding and antibonding initial states as well as that of the relevant final states at @xmath6 is clarified .",
    "an analysis of these results reveals dramatically how different contributions to the momentum matrix element can interfere constructively or destructively to enhance or supress the weights of photoelectrons excited from particular atomic sites and/or specific angular momentum channels .",
    "this remarkable result which , to our knowledge , has not been recognized previously in the literature , hints that the arpes matrix element may allow us to zoom in on the properties of very specific transitions even in complex unit cell materials .    concerning relevant literature , refs .",

    "undertakes an extensive comparison between the one - step predictions over a wide region in the momentum space when the initial state energy is held fixed at the @xmath5 with the corresponding experimental arpes results giving the fermi surface map in bisco .",
    "there is of course a large body of available work on the photoemission theory and refs .",
    "would provide a brief selection . on the experimental side",
    "as well the arpes studies of bisco are far too numerous to be cited with any completeness , and we refer only to a few representative papers .    an outline of this article as is follows .",
    "the introductory remarks are followed in section ii by a consideration of formal matters ; a few equations for the one - step model are presented ( subsection iia ) , and the problem of computing the momentum matrix element in a general lattice is formulated ( subsection iib ) . section iii delineates the relevant features of the lattice geometry ( subsection iiia ) and the band structure of bisco ( subsection iiib ) .",
    "the results of sections ii and iii serve as a source of frequent reference in the subsequent discussion .",
    "section iv is divided into several subsections to go over various salient features of the arpes spectra from @xmath6 .",
    "the aspects addressed concern : photon energy dependence ( subsection iva ) ; effect of final state width ( subsection ivb ) ; polarization dependence ( subsection ivc ) ; and , the final state band structure and momentum matrix element ( subsection ivd ) .",
    "section v takes up the question of the nature of the transition matrix element and the origin of specific spectral features in terms of the characters of the initial and final states and is divided into three parts dealing with : contributions of different atomic sites ( subsection va ) ; contributions of various angular momentum channels ( subsection vb ) ; and , comments on the @xmath2 dependence of the spectral intensities ( subsection vc ) .",
    "finally , section vi summarizes our results and makes a few concluding remarks .",
    "we begin by recalling that the arpes intensity in the one - step model can be expressed as@xcite @xmath10 where the ket @xmath11 denotes a free electron state with momentum , @xmath12 , parallel to the crystal surface , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the retarded ( + ) or advanced ( - ) one - electron green function for the final ( initial ) state and @xmath15 is the interaction hamiltonian in terms of the vector potential @xmath16 of the incident photon field and the electron momentum operator @xmath17 .",

    "it should be emphasized that the optical matrix element must in general be supplemented with other information specific to the photoemission experiment ( e.g. symmetry of the final state ) before connection with a particular measurement can be made .",
    "this issue will be addressed as needed in the remainder of this article .",

    "the size of the bilayer splitting is generally larger along @xmath88 compared to the @xmath89 direction .",
    "we have chosen to work in the present simulations with a potential that yields a rather large bilayer splitting because this makes it easier to identify the signatures of the bonding and antibonding bands @xmath87 and @xmath86 in the theoretical arpes spectra@xcite .",
    "however , computations have been repeated for numerous other cases where the bilayer splitting was varied by placing suitable potential barriers between the @xmath0 layers , and the results indicate that our conclusions concerning the nature of these states and their behavior in the arpes spectra are robust to such variations .    the analysis of the recent high resolution arpes spectra leaves little doubt that the fermi surface of bisco consists of two distinct sheets@xcite .",
    "one is the standard large hole - like sheet centered around the @xmath90 or @xmath91 symmetry point , and a second sheet arising from a band lying very close the the @xmath5 which could be either slightly hole- or electron - like .",
    "the precise position of the @xmath5 will depend of course on the doping level of the system . in any event ,",
    "it is often useful to avoid convoluting the computed spectra with the fermi function so that the nature of the spectra over a wider range of @xmath92 and energy values , including unoccupied states above the @xmath5 , can be elucidated .",
    "notably , the @xmath93 dispersion of bands terminating at points @xmath86 and @xmath87 , even though it varies with @xmath92 , is quite small ( order of a few mev at @xmath6 ) and is not important in much of our discussion .",
    "3 shows the arpes intensity from the antibonding and bonding states ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) at the @xmath6 point as a function of the photon energy . for our illustrative purposes",
    "we have taken the light to be polarized such that only the @xmath72-component of the vector potential @xmath94 is non - zero .",
    "the initial state width corresponds to @xmath95 mev @xcite .",
    "the final state width is set using @xmath96 ev@xmath3 we return to this point in section ivb below .",
    "the emission intensity is seen to change dramatically with photon energy .",
    "the bonding state emits strongly around 18 and 23 ev with a feature around 33 ev , while the antibonding state possesses a somewhat broad region of high emissions extending from 14 - 26 ev .",
    "the intensity for both states is relatively small from 27 - 40 ev and below 11 ev .",
    "these results have significant implications for arpes experiments .",
    "for example , emission maps from the @xmath5 can be expected to look quite different at various photon energies ; at an energy such as 22 ev , the emissions from the pristine lattice will be dominant , while at an energy such as 28 ev , the contributions due to modulations of the underlying symmetry ( e.g. orthorhombic distortion , superlattice modulation , etc . )",
    "will generally become more prominent@xcite .",
    "energies such as 18 or 23 ev will tend to highlight the bonding state while the antibonding state will likely be more intense around 22 ev , effects of final state broadening and other factors notwithstanding .",
    "we should particularly keep in mind that there are inherent uncertainities of a few ev s in locating the final states in the first principles computations , and that the positions of various features in fig .",
    "3 will generally possess similar uncertainty .",
    "we have carried out additional computations ( not shown in the interest of brevity ) and find that the aforementioned type of variations in intensity which selectively highlight different aspects of the electronic structure continue to be manifest at photon energies much higher than the 40 ev upper limit in fig .",
    "3 .      fig .",
    "4 shows how the plot of fig . 3 for the antibonding initial state changes when the final state width varies corresponding to @xmath97 values from 20 mev to 2 ev@xcite .",
    "the results for small @xmath97 make it clear that the spectrum is intrinsically made up of numerous transitions with different weights . with increasing @xmath97 these transitions broaden and overlap to produce varying spectral shapes of fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath98 mev",
    ", little change in shape occurs because the spectra are controlled by the initial and not the final state width , the former having a constant value given by @xmath95 mev in all cases .",
    "note that to reproduce the observed linewidths , @xmath97 used in the computations will need to account not only for the damping of the final state reflected via the imaginary part of the self - energy , but also the effects of experimental parameters such as the temperature of the measurement and the acceptor angle of the analyzer ( typically of order of a few tenths of a degree in the high resolution arpes setups ) . in this sense , @xmath97 is perhaps better viewed as a computational rather than a physical parameter in the theory with values ranging from 1 - 4 ev , where 4 ev is appropriate for 40 - 60 ev photons @xcite .",
    "incidentally , computations become more demanding as the value of @xmath97 decreases because the mean free path of the outgoing electron increases and an exponentially larger number of layers must be included in the calculations to obtain a converged result .",
    "insofar as the polarization dependence is concerned , note first that in fig .",
    "5 light is assumed incident normally to the surface and that the detector lies in the @xmath99 plane with the @xmath72-axis defined by the @xmath100 bond direction ; the polarization vector of light is varied holding all other experimental parameters fixed .",
    "the inserts in the shape of number eight are polar plots of the intensities of various peaks ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath103 between the polarization vector and the @xmath72-axis .",
    "the intensity is maximum for all peaks at @xmath104 , i.e. when the light is polarized along the @xmath100 bonds . under a @xmath105 rotation",
    "the intensity nearly vanishes as the polarization vector turns perpendicular to the plane of the detector .",
    "insight into the polarization dependence discussed in the preceding paragraph can be gained by examining the behavior of eq .",
    "[ y5 ] for the geometrical setup of fig .",
    "since the detector lies in the @xmath99 plane of mirror symmetry , the final state @xmath23 must obviously possess even symmetry with respect to this plane in order to be observable . on the other hand , @xmath106 or @xmath107 ( or , equivalently , @xmath108 or @xmath109 from eq .",

    "it follows then that only the matrix elements @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be non - zero for _ even _ initial states while for _ odd _ initial states only @xmath113 can be non - zero .",

    "more realistically , the initial state width increases with increasing binding energy .",
    "this effect is modelled by the edc of the thick line which shows that much of the structure for binding energies greater than @xmath122 100 mev is washed out by lifetime effects .",
    "6 compares the one - step arpes intensity at the @xmath6 point for the antibonding state @xmath86 with the corresponding result based on the bulk momentum matrix element of eq .",
    "[ y12 ] and helps address a number of related issues . the small final state width used in these simulations allows the intrinsic spectral structure to be seen clearly .",
    "the final state bands shown as a function of @xmath2 in the lower portion of the figure provide a map of all available transitions since @xmath2 is not conserved in the photoemission process .",
    "[ note that the horizontal scale has been converted to refer to the photon energy . ] it is striking that although these bands appear to form a semi - continuum , there are gaps in the underlying final state spectrum and the situation thus is quite unlike the free electron case@xcite .",
    "also , @xmath2 dispersion is not always negligible with some bands dispersing as much as 0.5 ev despite the small size of the bz in the z - direction .",
    "as already noted , it tends to be difficult to associate peaks in the one - step spectra with transitions to specific final states .",
    "the problem becomes exacerbated when states are broadened to incorporate finite lifetime effects .",
    "considerable insight into the behavior of the arpes matrix element can nevertheless be gained via the momentum matrix element @xmath35 of eq .",
    "[ y9 ] for bulk transitions .",
    "we emphasize however that @xmath35 does not properly account for the processes of transport and ejection of the photoelectron as is the case in the one - step arpes computation .",
    "moreover , since @xmath35 involves the bulk wavefuctions @xmath123 and @xmath124 , modifications of these wavefunctions in the vicinity of the surface and the effect of possible formation of surface states are not incorporated .",
    "even so , fig . 6 shows that the one - step spectrum for the antibonding state @xmath86 is rather similar to that based on the momentum matrix element .",
    "some differences in the intensities of certain peaks in the figure may be understood as consequences of the fact that the momentum matrix element has been evaluated at @xmath125 while in the one - step result @xmath2 value is in general non - zero and varies from @xmath125 to the zone boundaries at @xmath126 for various peaks .",
    "results for the bonding state @xmath87 ( not shown for brevity ) are similar in that the level of agreement between the one - step and the momentum matrix element based spectra is comparable to that of fig . 6 .",

    "we consider first the aforementioned transition 1 with the help of tables ii - v , followed by a few comments concerning the behavior of transitions more generally via fig .",
    "the weights in different angular momentum channels ( defined as @xmath133 ) for the initial states @xmath86 and @xmath87 associated with various atomic sites are given in tables ii and iii , while the final state for transition 1 is characterized similarly in table iv@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that these weights depend upon details of how space within the unit cell is ascribed to different atoms and the size and shape of the interstitial region . for this reason",
    ", we should keep in mind that the results of tables ii - iv possess inherent uncertainty , even though these are representative of the character of the states involved . as expected ,",
    "wavefunctions of both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are seen from tables ii and iii to be predominantly @xmath134 and @xmath135 like ; @xmath82 as well as @xmath77 states hybridize more strongly with the bonding level @xmath87 compared to @xmath86 . the final state in table iv continues to be weighted in favor of @xmath66 and @xmath68 , but being 17.7 ev above the initial states , there is substantial change with respect to distribution among angular momentum channels and atomic sites .",
    "we turn next to table v and the matrix element for transition 1 from state @xmath86 . of the large number of possible terms ( @xmath136 ) under the summations in eq .",
    "[ y14 ] , only the few elements @xmath137 listed in table v possess substantial magnitude .",
    "the remaining elements are either zero due to selection rules or are negligibly small .",
    "the @xmath138 channel on @xmath68 is seen to be the strongest with a contribution ( in arbitrary units ) of 0.27 .",
    "it is most striking that the net contribution from @xmath66 is only 0.02 even though the initial state is dominated by @xmath66 .",
    "this is the result of strong interference effects : on @xmath66 , different angular momentum channels interfere destructively as manifest in the positive and negative signs of elements , while on @xmath68 , there is a constructive interference yielding a large total intensity of 0.43 .",
    "these observations hint that the arpes matrix element can display remarkable site selectivity properties . for transition 1 under discussion , for example ,",
    "almost all the photoelectrons emanate from @xmath68 sites with little contribution from other sites in the crystal due to complicated interferences .",
    "8 considers all transitions from @xmath86 over the energy range of 10 - 27 ev .",
    "the total matrix element @xmath130 and the portion @xmath139 associated with @xmath68 in the top two panels of the figure are reproduced from fig . 7 for ease of discussion",
    "; the total @xmath68 intensity is decomposed into angular momentum channels in the three lower panels . by comparing the lengths of arrows in figs .",
    "8(a ) and 8(b ) , we see that for most transitions ( but not all ) @xmath68 component is strong .",
    "the effect however is not as dominant as in the case of transition 1 ; for example , only about 60 percent of transitions 2 - 4 come from @xmath68 and transition 6 has essentially a zero @xmath68 part .",
    "moreover , even though different angular momentum channels interfere constructively for most transitions in that arrows are mostly pointed up in figs .",
    "8(c)-(e ) , this is not always the case as some arrows are pointed downwards .",
    "in particular , for transition 5 roughly half of the intensity in @xmath140 channel is destroyed by inteference from @xmath138 channel , and for transition 7 , these two channels destroy each other nearly completely .",
    "we note finally that , of the many factors involved in defining @xmath141 on the right side of eq .",
    "17 , much of the energy dependence depicted in fig .",
    "8 originates from the behavior of the wavefunction coefficients of the final states ( @xmath142 ) ; the gaunt coefficients @xmath143 are constants and the quantities @xmath144 involving integrals of radial wavefunctions are slowly varying functions of energy .",
    "so far we have focused on the excitation of states @xmath86 and @xmath87 at the m(@xmath129,0,0 ) point , i.e. for @xmath125",
    ". changes in the momentum matrix element as a function of @xmath2 for several selected transitions from the initial state @xmath86 are considered in fig .",
    "transitions 1 - 4 have been discussed previously in connection with figs . 7 and 8 .",
    "transitions 2b and 3b however , which lie quite close in energy to transitions 2 and 3 , respectively , were not shown before since their intensity is zero or near - zero at @xmath125 , but as fig .",
    "9 shows , this is not the case for @xmath145 .",
    "transitions 1 and 4 decrease slightly in intensity as @xmath2 increases from zero to @xmath146 . on the other hand , transitions 2 ,",
    "2b , 3 or 3b undergo large changes .",
    "observable effects after spectra are smoothed with realistic broadenings of the order of a few ev s will likely be much smaller since the intensities of transitions 2 and 2b ( or similarly 3 and 3b ) taken together are expected to change little with @xmath2 .    we have carried out additional computations at @xmath147-points on the @xmath148 line away from @xmath6 .",
    "the results continue to display complicated interference effects involving pairs of atoms and/or various atomic sites , essentially along the lines of the preceding commentary concerning emissions from @xmath6 , and require little further elaboration .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the arpes spectrum from bisco using the first - principles band theory framework .",
    "our focus is on understanding emission from electronic states along the @xmath148 symmetry line and particularly from the bonding and antibonding combinations of bands formed from the states associated with the @xmath0 bilayers which have been the subject of considerable recent discussion and controversy .",
    "salient features of the arpes spectrum delineated are as follows .",
    "the intensity of the antibonding as well as the bonding state at @xmath6 displays a strong dependence on photon energy even though the two states differ significantly from each other in this respect .",
    "this result indicates that the bonding state will be highlighted at certain photon energies while the antibonding state will be intense at other energies ; moreover , at photon energies where emission from either state is relatively weak , we would expect the effects of deviations of the underlying lattice from perfect tetragonal symmetry ( i.e. via various modulations ) to become more visible .",
    "the spectra depend strongly on the polarization of the incident light . at the @xmath6 point , for states in the vicinity of the @xmath5 ,",
    "the intensity is maximum when light is polarized along the @xmath72- or the @xmath100 bond direction , but becomes nearly zero upon a @xmath105 rotation of the polarization vector perpendicular to the plane of the detector .",
    "simple arguments are presented to explain the @xmath149 ( where @xmath103 is the angle between the @xmath72-axis and the polarization vector ) variation observed in the one - step computations which yield a polar intensity plot in the shape of the number eight in bisco and other cuprates .",
    "an examination of the final states indicates that , despite the appearance of a semi - continuum , there are gaps in the final state spectrum and that the @xmath2 dispersion of some bands is as large as 0.5 ev even though the brillouin zone size is small along the z - direction .",
    "the situation thus is quite unlike the free electron case .",
    "we show how considerable insight into the nature of the _ specific _ arpes excitations can be adduced in terms of the momentum matrix element for _ bulk _ transitions within the solid in combination with constraints appropriate for a particular arpes measurement .",
    "such transition specific information tends to be difficult to ascertain within the more comprehensive one - step framework , especially in the presence of finite initial and final state dampings .",
    "\\5 . with the preceding point in mind , we have studied the nature of the momentum matrix element for emission from the @xmath0 plane related antibonding state @xmath86 and the bonding state @xmath87 at @xmath6 at length over the transition energy range of 10 - 27 ev .",
    "we show how the matrix element , @xmath150 , can be decomposed usefully into contributions from various atomic `` pairs '' in the unit cell ( i.e. an atom and its mirror partner obtained by reflection through the @xmath63 layer about which the bisco lattice is symmetric ) , and further into different angular momentum channels .",
    "contributions from the two atoms in the aforementioned atomic pairs display remarkable effects of interfering _ constructively _ for some transitions and _ destructively _ for others .",
    "the net contribution from the @xmath68 pairs seems to dominate the spectrum in many cases even though the initial and final states involved possess large weights on the cu sites .",
    "these strong interference effects continue to be present in different angular momentum channels .",
    "the analysis indicates that many transitions are controlled essentially by just the _ single _ @xmath151 channel on the @xmath68 sites .",
    "this striking result hints that the arpes matrix element may possess most interesting site selectivity properties .",
    "the intensity of many transitions increases ( or decreases ) substantially as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "however , these variations are usually coupled with nearby transitions whose intensity decreases ( or increases ) so that the net contribution is generally not expected to show a strong @xmath2 dependence .    in summary ,",
    "the present analysis makes it clear that the complicated nature of the arpes matrix element in complex materials hides considerable potential for extracting useful information via this spectroscopy about the nature of specific states .",
    "studies of other cuprates along these lines should allow an identification of robust aspects of the electronic structure related to the @xmath0 planes .    it is a pleasure to acknowledge important conversations with bob markiewicz .",
    "this work is supported by the us department of energy contract w-31 - 109-eng-38 , and benefited from the allocation of supercomputer time at the nersc and the northeastern university advanced scientific computation center ( ascc ) and institute of advanced computing ( iac ) , tampere .",
