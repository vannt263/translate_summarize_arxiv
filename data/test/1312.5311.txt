    "since the pressure in relativistic plasma should not be less than that of surrounding x - ray gas , insight can be gained into the extent to which the relativistic plasma departs from a state of minimum energy or requires extra pressure to be provided by non - radiating particles or a reduced filling factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . where a detection of inverse - compton radiation from the cavities can be used to measure the magnetic field , the minimum - energy assumption is tested , and results concerning the other pressure components are more secure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in abell3744",
    ", while there is not a clean spectral separation of inverse - compton and thermal emission in the cavity , the suggestion of lower metallicity implies that inverse compton emission is not completely negligible , providing a modeling constraint .",
    "the average gas pressure surrounding the x - ray cavity can be calculated from the x - ray radial profile , giving ] @xmath102 pa ( @xmath18 error ) .",
    "a sphere of radius 100 arcsec evacuated of x - ray - emitting gas provides a model for the cavity that is consistent with the surface - brightness distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cavityplotit ] ) .",
    "we model the cavity s radio emission from our map using data from program ac105 as synchrotron radiation from electrons with a power - law distribution of @xmath95 extending to a minimum lorentz factor of @xmath103 , to find a minimum - energy field strengthg ] in the cavity of @xmath104 nt ( no protons ) or 1.0 nt ( equal energy in protons and electrons ) .",
    "we do nt have radio data to constrain @xmath105 , but the adopted value is supported by the x - ray data if modeled as power - law emission from inverse compton scattering by the electron population (  [ sec : armhole ] ) .",
    "the resulting pressure is a factor of 5.0 ( 3.5 ) too low to match that in surrounding x - ray gas , where here and in what follows the first value is for no protons and the second for equal energy in protons and electrons .    while the cavity pressure can be increased by adding further non - radiating particles or reducing the filling factor , the prediction for inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background radiation is still then less than 6 per cent of the x - ray counts from the cavity , not explaining the reduced metallicity when the spectrum is fitted entirely to thermal emission .",
    "in contrast , a small departure from minimum energy in the sense of a reduced magnetic field can both provide the required pressure and explain the metallicites . specifically , reducing the magnetic field strength to 30 ( 37 ) per cent of the minimum - energy value , i.e. , to 0.26 ( 0.37 ) nt , matches the pressure and provides an increase in electron number density ( to match the radio synchrotron emission ) such that 52 ( 27 ) per cent of the 0.35-kev x - ray counts from this region would be from inverse compton emission .",
    "a modest departure from minimum energy is consistent with findings elsewhere , and in particular with the lobes of radio galaxies for which x - ray inverse compton is detected and modeled using the same value of @xmath106 as adopted here @xcite .",
    "we then note that the cavity shape would need to be somewhat spheroidal and elongated along the line of sight , to explain the surface brightness contrast of figure  [ fig : cavityplotit ] in the presence of extra ( inverse compton ) x - ray counts in the cavity .",
    "the sound speed in x - ray gas of temperature @xmath51 ( kev ) is roughly @xmath107 km s@xmath2 , meaning that radio plasma should have been developing and filling the cavity for at least @xmath108 yrs for the cavity not to have collapsed .",
    "this is within the lifetime of typical radio galaxies based on spectral aging measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngc7018 , whose southern lobe is currently at the edge of the cavity , would have taken a comparable time ( @xmath109 yr ) to cross the cavity at a speed characteristic of the cluster velocity dispersion , and faster speeds are expected here , near the cluster center .",
    "thus it seems likely that the radio plasma of ngc7018  is primarily responsible for carving out the cavity .",
    "in contrast , the radio emission of ngc7016  is broken into the swirl inside the cavity .",
    "while this might be due to collision with radio plasma of ngc7018 , it may also result from interaction with a wake left by the motion of ngc7018  and its companion galaxy ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if ngc7018  is responsible for the cavity , its lobes should be at least mildly overpressured with respect to the surrounding gas .",
    "the s lobe lies at the entrance to the cavity where the average gas pressure ( calculated using the x - ray radial profile for an off - center angular distance of 65 arcsec ) is @xmath110 pa ( @xmath18 error ) .",
    "we model the lobe using our 1.39-ghz jvla data with parameters as for the cavity . ] , but with a sphere of radius 18 arcsec , to find a minimum - energy field strength of @xmath111 ( 2.6 ) nt and a pressure of @xmath112 pa , slightly above that in the external gas .",
    "if the magnetic field is below the minimum - energy value by the amount we argue is likely for the cavity , then the s lobe is overpressured by a factor of 4.9 with respect to its surrounding gas .",
    "such an overpressure would lead to a shock of mach number 2 being driven into the external medium ( e.g. , equation 49 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and direct heating in the immediate vicinity of the lobe , not ruled out by the data due to masking by much foreground and background gas along the line of sight . direct evidence of shock heating is difficult to verify around cluster - embedded radio lobes , but there is growing evidence for moderately strong shocks around intermediate - power radio galaxies like ngc7018  @xcite .",
    "it is striking that the radio filament of the s lobe of ngc7018  ( fig  [ fig : radio ] ) runs along the northern inside edge of the cavity ( fig  [ fig : large ] ) .",
    "the structure contains strands , and the brightening is suggestive of preferential particle acceleration along the interface between the cavity and the external x - ray gas  something which in principle could be tested by radio spectral index mapping .    the tendrils of ngc7018  run along the outside of the plateau and look like they are buoyant , so that their deprojected pressures should match those in the plateau , as measured using the spectral fit and profile in figure  [ fig : profilesew ] . to test this",
    "we take rectangular sections at the end of each tendril modeled as cylinders of radius 21 arcsec and lengths 126 and 162 arcsec centered at distances from the center of the gas distribution of 380 and 530 arcsec for the sw and nw tendrils , respectively .",
    "if the tendrils are in the plane of the sky , the external pressure in the sw and nw is @xmath113 and @xmath114 pa , respectively . for minimum energy",
    "the two tendrils then agree in being under - pressured by a factor of 5.5 ( 3.9 ) , where again the two values correspond to a lepton - only plasma or one where the lepton energy density is matched by that in protons .",
    "if in the plane of the sky with no significant entrainment , pressure balance can be restored if the magnetic field is 29 ( 35 ) percent of the minimum - energy value .",
    "these departures from minimum energy are remarkably similar to those required in the cavity , and by the region in the nw tendril the magnetic field strength so estimated would have dropped to about half that in the cavity . however , while there may be reasons for dynamic structures to depart from minimum energy , it is more appealing for these buoyant flows to have reached a state of minimum energy .",
    "the tendrils extend into the region where the x - ray gas pressure is falling with radius , @xmath115 , as roughly @xmath116 , and they would be in pressure balance with this gas if lying at about @xmath117 degrees to the line of sight .",
    "the actual value of @xmath118 is likely to be set by the unknown direction of the velocity vector of ngc7018 , such that the buoyant tendrils trail , and such values of @xmath118 are plausible .",
    "some increase in internal pressure in the tendrils through gas entrainment is also likely , allowing @xmath118 to increase from these estimates .",
    "not being in the plane of the sky has the advantage of explaining the rather dramatic fading of the tendrils which occurs at larger @xmath115 for smaller @xmath118 .",
    "strong fading is expected sufficiently far out in the cluster outer atmosphere that the tendrils are no longer supported , and the relativistic plasma expands adiabatically .",
    "this is easily accommodated by a further steepening in the radial profiles beyond the values of @xmath115 for which we are able to make measurements in the current data .",
    "the broad tendril to the se is the extension of the brighter ( approaching ) jet of ngc7016 .",
    "the two jet bends , first to the south and then to the east ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] ) and presumably the result of shocks , are sufficiently large in projection to suggest that this jet is at a relatively small angle to the line of sight .",
    "we test a cylinder of radius 33 arcsec and length 98 arcsec ( position angle 70 degrees ) at 340 arcsec from the center of the gas distribution where the external pressure ( in the cooler gas here ) is @xmath119 pa . as for ngc7018 s tendrils , there is an underpressure by a factor of a few that can be restored if the radio emission is lying at 24 ( 31 ) degrees to the line of sight .",
    "x - ray cavities are sufficiently common that they are regarded as an important heat source , with enough power to balance radiative cooling in dense cluster cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of the abell3744 s cavity",
    ", we can estimate the change in enthalpy as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the pressure of the x - ray gas , @xmath122 is the volume of the cavity , and @xmath123 is the ratio of specific heats for relativistic gas . the resulting value is roughly @xmath124 j. in  [ sec : integrated ] we pointed out that in its integrated properties the cluster is too hot by @xmath31 kev for its luminosity , based on scaling relations .",
    "this is equivalent to an excess enthalpy of @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the total gas mass , @xmath127 is the particle mass , and @xmath128 is the ratio of specific heats for the x - ray - emitting gas . the resulting value is roughly @xmath129 j. a staggering 85 cavities like those attributed to ngc7018  would be needed to explain the excess heat in abell3744  that causes it to deviate from scaling relations .",
    "the most likely source of the excess heat is therefore a merger .",
    "the temperature structure seen in figure  [ fig : contbin ] points to such a merger being roughly along a nw - se direction , such that gas heated in collisions escapes to the sides .",
    "it is also consistent with the velocity data discussed in ",
    "[ sec : velocities ] and the two centers marked as crosses in figure [ fig : armhole ] .",
    "if we take the merging group to have about 5 per cent of the mass of abell3744 , based on the number of galaxies within known velocities , and use the radial - velocity offset of roughly 1700 km s@xmath2 as the total velocity difference , then the conversion of 20 per cent of the kinetic energy of the group would be sufficient to produce the required excess heating .",
    "that is , the heating requires only a minor merger event .",
    "the absence of a shock feature in the x - ray image is not unexpected if this merger is indeed responsible for the heating , since such shocks are only seen when the merger is in the plane of the sky , and the radial velocity difference would be excessive if the merger axis is far from the line of sight in the present case .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that mergers lead to persistent ( gigayears ) relative motion of gas streams which are in pressure equilibrium ( sloshing ) , and this can explain x - ray features seen rather commonly in relaxed cool - core galaxy clusters and known as cold fronts , where a large density discontinuity is in pressure balance due to the dense gas being cooler @xcite .",
    "abell3744  is far from relaxed , and shows no obvious evidence of sloshing .",
    "we clearly see density substructure , but the temperature and density features lie in different parts of the gas , the former having a closer relationship to the location of the radio tendrils .",
    "the most likely explanation is that we are witnessing a relatively recent merger encounter , one which may also have helped trigger the radio galaxies into their current phase of activity .",
    "the excess x - ray emission in the region we name the ` plateau ' can be understood since the centroid of the distribution of galaxies with reported velocities ( biased towards the more massive ones ) lies in this neighborhood .",
    "its temperature is unremarkable compared with that in the x - ray brightest region , including the temperatures in the arm and surrounding the cavity .",
    "what is remarkable is that the radio tendrils of ngc7018  appear to border the hottest gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contbin ] ) , and envelop the roughly cylindrical gas region seen in figure  [ fig : armhole ] that forms the bright x - ray bridge between the arm and the plateau .",
    "it is tempting to invoke cause and effect , such that the radio plasma of ngc7018  helps to reduce thermal transport between the warmer and cooler gas , and to reduce momentum transport and hence viscous drag , so that x - ray gases of different temperatures can slide by one another with little heat exchange or mixing .",
    "the regions in the temperature map were defined automatically from the smoothed x - ray data , with no reference to the radio structures .",
    "it is also notable that the southern tendril of ngc7016  lies along a temperature boundary .",
    "the morphology of the radio and x - ray extensions suggest that the radio extensions of ngc7018 s lobes were caused by the relative motion of the host galaxy and the gas extending into the plateau .",
    "the attachment of radio plasma to this infalling gas would cause the extension of the radio lobes into the tendrils and cause the gas bridge to become at least partially enveloped by the radio plasma . because the radio plasma is moderately strongly magnetized",
    ", it will act as an effective barrier to transport between the inner arm and the general cluster environment .",
    "not only are the particle gyroradii smaller ( by a factor of about 10 ) in the radio plasma than in the general cluster environment , but the field will also tend to be ordered by the stretching along the radio tendrils",
    ". this will reduce the ( perpendicular ) thermal conductivity between the two gas regions .",
    "the degree of thermal protection offered by the radio features depends both on the reduction in transport through the radio plasma and the fraction of the interface between regions of different temperature covered by the radio plasma .",
    "taking spitzer conductivity @xmath130 @xcite appropriate for intracluster gas , and modeling the gas as a cylinder of radius @xmath131  kpc , the timescale for a temperature difference @xmath132 to be erased is of the order @xmath133 or about 100 myr , taking the proton density , @xmath134 , to be roughly 940 m@xmath44 (  [ sec : integrated ] ) .",
    "this is significantly shorter than the time ( about 300 myr ) taken for the gas to travel from ngc7018  to the plateau at the sound speed .",
    "however , it appears that at least half the surface area is covered by radio plasma .",
    "if this radio plasma cuts @xmath135 by a factor of about 10 , then effective heat transport occurs over only about half the surface of the cylinder and its thermal lifetime is raised by a factor of order 3 .",
    "the associated drop in viscosity may also help the gas to slide in towards the plateau .",
    "there is good evidence of x - ray emission from both the east and west components of the northern double hotspot of ngc7018 , each with similar ratios of x - ray to radio flux density .",
    "the x - ray emission is about two orders of magnitude higher than expected due to inverse - compton scattering if the electrons and magnetic field are at minimum energy .",
    "this result is in common with many other _ chandra_-observed hotspots , particularly those in fr  ii radio galaxies at the lower end of the spectrum of total radio power @xcite , the large reduction in magnetic field ( about a factor of 24 for ngc7018 ) and the subsequent high increase in source energy needed to explain the x - ray emission by the inverse - compton mechanism led @xcite to suggest that the electron spectrum extends to high enough energies in such hotspots for synchrotron radiation to dominate the x - ray output . in ngc7018 s hotspots ,",
    "if the electron spectrum breaks from a power law slope of @xmath136 ( giving the observed @xmath137 ) by @xmath138=1 at a lorentz factor of @xmath139 , the synchrotron radiation from 100-tev electrons could be responsible for the x - rays in both components in minimum - energy magnetic fields of about 10 nt . while this is an attractively simple explanation , we note that @xcite have used _ spitzer _  data to claim that a single - component broken - power - law synchrotron spectrum can be excluded for 80 per cent of 24 hotspots they study .",
    "they point to the work of @xcite as possible support for magnetic fields in hotspots not having increased to minimum - energy levels .",
    "an alternative reason that hotspots on the jet side of a source ( as in ngc7018 ) may be unusually x - ray bright is if relativistic beaming is a factor . an applicable mechanism suggested by @xcite",
    "is that for a jet approaching a hotspot with high bulk lorentz factor the available photon fields for compton scattering will be boosted by the strongly directional ( particularly in the jet frame ) radio synchrotron emission from the terminal hotspot , resulting in inverse compton x - rays beamed in the forward direction of the jet and offset ( upstream ) from the peak of the radio emission . at high",
    "redshift the spatial separation of components necessary to test this mechanism is not possible , although a claim at low redshift has been made for pks b2152 - 699 @xcite . in ngc7018",
    "there is some evidence for an offset between radio and x - ray emission , although we can not rule out residual uncertainties in our 5-ghz radio mapping 3.5 arcmin off axis as responsible .",
    "a non - detection of the southern hotspot region , at the termination of the jet pointed away from the observer , is consistent with beaming playing a part in the detection of the x - ray hotspots , although statistics are such that the formal upper limit on the x - ray flux is at a similar level to the detections in the north , and so without more sensitive x - ray data firm conclusions can not be drawn .",
    "we have presented results using new _ chandra _  and jvla observations of abell3744 , together with archival lower - resolution vla data .",
    "we find the cluster to be far from relaxed , and devoid of a cool core .",
    "the gas is too hot on average by @xmath31 kev for the cluster to agree with temperature - luminosity correlations , and while there is a 100 kpc - scale cavity carved out by radio - emitting plasma , the excess enthalpy is insufficient to explain the heating .",
    "much of what is observed seems likely to have been caused by the recent merger of a small subgroup of galaxies with fast relative motion at relatively small angle to the line of sight in a roughly se - nw projected direction .",
    "this can easily produce enough heating , and seems to explain the temperature distribution , where hotter gas lies in directions perpendicular to the inferred line of encounter .",
    "existing galaxy - velocity data provide some support for this minor - merger hypothesis , but a more detailed survey of galaxy velocities in the field is needed to provide a more complete test .",
    "while the x - ray data provide no evidence for shocks ( understandable since velocity data suggest the encounter is not in the plane of the sky ) , or isobaric density drops ( cold fronts ) that would be explainable by gas sloshing , there is much interplay between the x - ray gas and the relativistic plasma hosted by ngc7016  and ngc7018 .",
    "this radio - emitting plasma terminates in buoyant tendrils reaching the cluster s extremities . in the case of ngc7018",
    ", a tendril trails from each radio lobe , almost certainly as a result of the galaxy s motion and consequent drag .",
    "in contrast , the counter jet of ngc7016  runs into the x - ray cavity , where it produces a dramatic swirl perhaps due to collision with the radio plasma from ngc7018  or in the wake of its motion , but a tendril extends from the highly bent southeastern jet .",
    "an important and noticeable feature of the tendrils is that they run along boundaries between gas of different temperatures . because the radio plasma is moderately strongly magnetized , it will act as an effective barrier to transport between gas layers and reduce the effective viscosity , helping to preserve post - merger gas flows .",
    "the radio galaxies hosted by ngc7016  and ngc7018  both have powers in the range that dominates output in the universe as a whole , and so are most important for understanding radio - mode feedback .",
    "the most apparent ways in which this feedback is mediated by these sources is through the large x - ray cavity and the capacity for the tendrils to allow the sliding of gas flows and the containment of temperature structures .",
    "in other respects the x - ray properties of the radio galaxies are normal for their radio powers . the power - law x - ray emission from both nuclei is unabsorbed and lies within the scatter of radio / x - ray correlations , arguing in favor of a common non - thermal origin for the radio and x - ray core emission .",
    "resolved x - ray emission is detected from the brighter jet in each source .",
    "x - rays are detected from both components of the northern double hotspot of ngc7018 , which we have discussed in some detail given the on - going debate concerning the flow - speed into hotspots and the origin of their x - ray emission .",
    "we acknowledge support from nasa grant go1 - 12010x .",
