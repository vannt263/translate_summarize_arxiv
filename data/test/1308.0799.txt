    "remote control systems are those in which the controlled objects are located away from the control signal generators .",
    "they are widely used at the present day , from video games @xcite to spacecraft @xcite , see @xcite for other examples . in remote control systems ,",
    "control signals are to be transmitted through rate - limited channels such as wireless channels @xcite or the internet @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "efficient signal compression or representation is essential to send control signals through communication channels . for this purpose",
    ", we propose an approach of sparse control signal representation using the _ compressive sampling _",
    "technique @xcite for remote control systems .",
    "compressive sampling , also known as compressed sensing , is a technique for acquiring and reconstructing signals in the _ sparse - land _ @xcite .",
    "signal acquisition and reconstruction is one of the fundamental issues in signal processing . in many applications , signals are analog ( or continuous - time ) before they are acquired and converted to digital ( or discrete - time ) signals .",
    "the problem is how to acquire and convert analog signals to digital ones without much information distortion , such as aliasing .",
    "a well - known and widely - used solution to this problem is _",
    "shannon s sampling theorem _",
    "this theorem gives an acquisition and reconstruction method for perfect reconstruction ; if the sampling rate is faster than twice the nyquist rate , the maximum frequency contained in the original analog signal , then the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed via sinc series . on the other hand , in the sparse - land , signals are _ sparse _ or _ compressible _ under a certain signal representation ( e.g. , fourier or wavelet ) .",
    "this sparsity assumption on signals is known to be valid for many real signals , e.g. , see examples in @xcite .",
    "compressive sampling is based on this fact , by which one can reconstruct the original signal with very high fidelity from far fewer samples than what the conventional sampling theorem requires .",
    "hence signal acquisition and compression can be performed in much more efficient manner , than the conventional scheme such as the image compression jpeg @xcite , where one acquires the full signal , then transforms it into the frequency domain , and finally discards most of them to obtain a compressed signal .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose to use compressive sampling for remote control systems .",
    "our contributions in this paper are as follows :    * we propose a new feed - forward - based remote control system with compressive sampling .",
    "* the proposed system can efficiently compress the control signals with sparse representation . *",
    "the design problem is formulated by @xmath1 optimization which can be efficiently solved .",
    "the theory of compressive sampling has been applied to not only signal processing but also statistics @xcite , information theory @xcite , machine learning @xcite , and so on . for theory and application of compressive sampling , see books @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , so far only a few studies have applied compressive sampling to _ control _ : @xcite proposes to use compressive sensing in feedback control systems for perfect state reconstruction and @xcite proposes sparse representation of transmitted control packets for feedback control .",
    "for remote control systems , @xcite also proposes to use @xmath1 optimization as in this paper , but the compressive sampling technique ( fourier expansion and random sampling ) is not used . as we mentioned above , it is desirable that signals in remote control systems are effectively acquired and compactly compressed .",
    "therefore , we propose to adopt compressive sampling technique to remote control systems .",
    "compressive sampling in this paper can be considered as a kind of lossy compression . in many lossy data compression problems , the objective is to find efficient approximate representations of the original data  @xcite , and the distortion is measured by the signal reconstruction error . on the other hand , in this paper",
    ", we consider a different aspect of the distortion , that is , we measure the efficiency of the lossy compression with _ control performance_. in other words , our method aims at optimizing the control performance , e.g. , minimizing the tracking error , while usual compressive sampling minimizes the @xmath0 norm of the reconstruction error , with a sparsity constraint .",
    "this is a natural notion in control ; we do not care about how small the compression error of the control signal is but how good the control performance is .",
    "thus we call the proposed approach _ control - oriented compressive sampling_.    in remote control systems , control delays due to heavy computation seriously degrade the performance . in compressive sampling ,",
    "signal acquisition is realized by a random non - uniform sampler @xcite or a random demodulator @xcite , which takes almost no computational time .",
    "in contrast , obtaining sparse representation of a signal is achieved by solving @xmath1 optimization @xcite , also known as lasso @xcite or basis pursuit de - noising @xcite .",
    "the solution to the @xmath1 optimization can not be represented in an analytical form as in @xmath0 optimization , and hence we resort to iteration method to achieve the optimal solution .",
    "there have been recently a number of researches on this type of optimization , and there are several efficient algorithms for the solution @xcite .",
    "moreover , the low rate random sampling leads to reduced computational complexity of optimization .",
    "that is , we can use such computationally efficient algorithms with the low rate sampling in remote control to reduce control delays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : problem ] , we define our control problem . in section [ sec : conventional ] , we formulate and solve the problem via conventional sampling theorem . in section [ sec : cs ] , we propose a new control method based on compressive sampling .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] gives a theoretical result for performance analysis of the proposed control .",
    "we show a numerical example in section [ sec : examples ] to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .",

    "[ fig : plant ] shows the block diagram of the system @xmath34 with the input @xmath46 , the output @xmath45 , and the initial state @xmath47 .    in order to show the significance of the proposed approach , we consider _ tracking problem _ in this paper as an example of the control problem . in the tracking problem , the controller attempts to reduce the tracking error between a given reference @xmath48 and the output @xmath45 over @xmath30 $ ] . in other words , we design a control signal @xmath49}$ ] for a reference signal @xmath50}$ ] such that @xmath51 over @xmath30 $ ] .",

    "the tracking error @xmath52 is small , 2 .",
    "the `` size '' @xmath53 of the control signal @xmath46 is not too large , 3 .   and the maximum frequency contained in @xmath46 is bounded by a fixed frequency .",
    "the first objective is for tracking performance ; if @xmath54 is smaller , the performance is said to be better .",
    "theoretically , @xmath54 can be made arbitrarily small if the size @xmath53 is not restricted .",
    "[ ex : step ] let @xmath55 denote the laplace transform of the impulse response of the linear system @xmath34 .",
    "suppose @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and the reference @xmath48 is given in the laplace transform by @xmath58",
    ". then if we choose @xmath46 with its laplace transform @xmath59 then the performance in terms of the tracking error will be perfect , that is , @xmath60 over @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "however , the inverse laplace transform of @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and hence @xmath64 has the property @xmath65 since @xmath57 .",
    "that is , if @xmath66 becomes large , then @xmath67 increases exponentially .",
    "@xmath68    this example is not a special case ; we can generally say that a small tracking error leads to a large control signal if @xmath55 has an unstable zero , that is , there exists @xmath69 such that @xmath70 .",
    "for example , suppose that the size of @xmath46 is measured by @xmath71 , the energy of the control signal @xmath46 . as mentioned above , a smaller tracking error @xmath54 leads to a larger energy @xmath71 .",
    "it follows that we have to transmit the information of a signal with a very large energy through a communication channel . in many cases , a larger energy results in a larger amplitude of a signal , and",
    "hence the variance becomes larger if the mean of @xmath64 is @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that the entropy of the signal increases and so does the amount of information .",
    "moreover , large @xmath53 leads to high sensitivity to noise in measurement of the initial value @xmath47 or uncertainty in the model parameters @xmath43 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore add a constraint on @xmath53 as the second control objective .",
    "the size @xmath53 is not restricted to the energy ; one can take another function as will be defined in section [ sec : cs ] .",
    "the third objective is also needed in real control systems .",
    "the control signal @xmath46 is applied to the controlled object through an actuator ( e.g. , a motor ) , which can not act at a speed faster than a fixed frequency . to describe this constraint mathematically ,",

    "if the regularization term @xmath53 in ( [ eq:2norm - const ] ) is defined as @xmath84 , the optimization problem becomes the least - square optimization .",
