    "the existence of absolutely continuous invariant probability measures ( _ acip _",
    "s ) for dynamical systems is a problem with a history going back more than 70 years , see for example pioneering papers by hopf @xcite and ulam and von neumann @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding an extensive amount of research in this direction in the last two or three decades , the problem is still not completely solved even in the one - dimensional setting which is the focus of this paper .",
    "quite general conditions are known which guarantee the existence of _ acip _",
    "s for uniformly expanding maps in the smooth case or possibly admitting singularities , i.e. discontinuities with possibly unbounded derivatives ( see @xcite@xcite for additional remarks and references ) , and for smooth maps with a finite number of critical points ( see @xcite for first and strongest results including decay of correlations , and @xcite for the most recent and possibly the most general conditions for the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures in this setting ) and even for smooth maps with a countable number of critical points @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in a general class of maps which contain critical points _ and _ singularities .",
    "a natural family of maps belonging to this class was introduced in @xcite and motivated by the study of the return map of the lorenz equations near classical parameter values , see figure 1 .",
    "it is clear from the arguments in these papers , that the presence of both critical points and singularities and their interaction can give rise to significant technical as well as fundamental issues . in particular , as we shall see in the present setting , it is not enough to have just some expansivity conditions in order to obtain the existence of an acip , as expansivity might occur due to the regions of unbounded derivative even when the deeper dynamical structure of the map is very pathological .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the interaction of critical points and singularities could give rise to new phenomena which are still unexplored .",
    "some general results for the existence of _ acip _ s and their properties in maps with critical points and singularities were obtained in @xcite under the assumption that _ lebesgue almost every point _",
    "satisfy some exponential derivative growth and subexponential recurrence conditions .",
    "these conditions provide an interesting conceptual picture but may be hard to verify in practice . on the other hand , it was proved in @xcite @xcite that with positive probability in the parameter space of lorenz - like families , the orbits of the _ critical points _",
    "satisfy such exponential derivative growth and subexponential recurrence conditions .",
    "in @xcite it was shown , within a more general setting of maps with multiple critical points and singularities , that these conditions are in fact sufficient to guarantee the existence of an ergodic _ acip _ ( from which it can in fact be proved that lebesgue almost every point also satisfies such conditions ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to obtain the same conclusion but relax as much as possible the conditions on the orbit of the critical points , to include in particular cases in which the derivative growth may be subexponential and/or the recurrence of the critical points exponential .",
    "a crucial observation concerning the difference between the smooth case and the case with singularities discussed here is that in the smooth case , for which in particular the derivative is bounded , any condition on the growth of the derivative is also implicitly a condition on the recurrence to the critical set .",
    "indeed sufficiently strong recurrence to the critical set will always kill off any required derivative growth . on the other hand , this is not the case in our setting .",
    "derivative growth may be exponential but arise as a consequence of very strong recurrence to the singularities even if we have at the same time very strong recurrence to the critical set .",
    "strong recurrence to either the singular or the critical set brings its own deep structural problems and can be an intrinsic obstruction to the existence of an _ acip_. we shall formulate below a condition which simultaneously keeps track of the growth of the derivative along critical orbits and of the recurrence of such orbits to the critical set within a single summability condition .",
    "this optimizes the result to include a larger class of maps than would be possible by having to independent conditions both of which need to be satisfied .",
    "we conjecture that it is not possible to obtain a general result on the existence of acip s in the presence of both critical points and singularities by assuming only conditions on the derivative growth of critical points .",
    "we now give the precise statement of our result .",
    "we let @xmath0 denote the class of interval map satisfying the conditions formulated in sections [ c1 ] , [ c2 ] and [ c3 ] below .",
    "then we have the following    [ th : physical ] every map @xmath1 admits a finite number of absolutely continuous invariant ( physical ) probability measures whose basins cover @xmath2 up to a set of measure 0 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an interval and @xmath4 be a piecewise @xmath5 map : by this we mean that there exists a finite set @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is @xmath8 and monotone on each connected component of @xmath9 and admits a continuous extension to the boundary so that @xmath10 exists .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the set of all `` one - sided critical points '' @xmath12 and @xmath13 and define corresponding one - sided neighbourhoods @xmath14 for each @xmath15 . for simplicity , from now on",
    "we use @xmath16 to represent the generic element of @xmath11 and write @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that each @xmath19 has a well - defined ( one - sided ) critical order @xmath20 in the sense that @xmath21 for all @xmath22 in some @xmath23 .",
    "note that we say that @xmath24 if the ratio @xmath25 is bounded above and below uniformly in the stated domain . if @xmath26 we say that @xmath27 is a _ singular _ point as this implies unbounded derivative near @xmath27 ; if @xmath28 we say that @xmath27 is a _",
    "critical _ point as this implies that the derivative tends to @xmath29 near @xmath27 .",
    "we shall assume also that @xmath30 for every @xmath27 as this would be a degenerate case which is not hard to deal with but would require having to introduce special notation and special cases , whereas the other cases can all be dealt with in a unified formalism .    for future reference",
    "we point out that this immediately implies @xmath31 for all @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the distance of the point @xmath32 to the critical / singular set @xmath34 ( indeed this is the actual property of which we will make use ) .",
    "we suppose that @xmath35 is `` uniformly expanding away from the critical points '' , meaning that the following two conditions are satisfied : there exists a constant @xmath36 , independent of @xmath37 , such that for every point @xmath32 and every integer @xmath38 such that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and @xmath41 we have @xmath42 and , for every @xmath15 there exist constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : ue }    @xmath22 and @xmath46 such that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that both these conditions are quite natural and are often satisfied for smooth maps without discontinuities .",
    "more specifically , the first one is satisfied if @xmath7 is @xmath47 , has negative schwarzian derivative and satisfies the property that the the derivative along all critical orbits tends to infinity , see theorem 1.3 in @xcite .",
    "the second is satisfied in even greater generality , namely when @xmath35 is @xmath48 and all periodic points are repelling @xcite .      for each @xmath49",
    "we write @xmath50 to denote the derivative along the orbit of @xmath27 and the distance of @xmath27 from the critical set respectively .",
    "we then assume that for every critical point @xmath27 with @xmath51 we have @xmath52    this condition plays off the derivative against the recurrence in such a way as to optimize to some extent the class of maps to which it applies . as mentioned in section [ sumcon ] above",
    ", we can not expect to obtain the conclusions of our main theorem in this setting using a condition which only takes into account the growth of the derivative .",
    "notice that condition ( @xmath53 ) is satisfied if the derivative is growing exponentially fast and the recurrence is not faster than exponential in the sense that @xmath54 here and in the rest of the paper , the symbol @xmath55 means that the inequality holds up to some multiplicative constant , i.e. there exists a constant @xmath56 independent of @xmath57 or any other constants , such that @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "our strategy for the proof is to construct a countable partition @xmath60 of @xmath61 ( mod 0 ) into open intervals , define an inducing time function @xmath62 which is constant on elements of @xmath60 , and let @xmath63 denote the induced map defined by @xmath64 this induced map is uniformly expanding on each element of @xmath65 but does _ not _ have many desirable properties such as uniformly bounded distortion or long branches .",
    "nevertheless it has the two key properties we shall require which are summable inducing times and summable variation .",
    "we recall that the _ variation _ of a function @xmath66 over a subinterval @xmath67 $ ] of @xmath3 is defined by @xmath68 and all choices of points @xmath69 . for each @xmath70",
    "we define the function @xmath71 by @xmath72 our main technical result in this paper is the following    there exists a countable partition @xmath60 of @xmath61 ( mod 0 ) and an inducing time function @xmath62 , constant on elements of @xmath60 , such that the induced map @xmath73 is uniformly expanding and satisfies the the following properties .    1 .   ( summable variation ) @xmath74 2 .",
    "( summable inducing times ) @xmath75    theorem 1 implies the main theorem by known arguments .",
    "indeed , by a result of rychlik the summable variation property together with uniform expansion implies that @xmath76 admits a finite number of ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure whose basins cover @xmath2 up to a set of measure zero @xcite . by standard arguments",
    "the summable inducing time property implies that these measures can be pulled back to a absolutely continuous invariant probability measure for the original map @xmath7 satisfying the same properties @xcite .",
    "the arguments used in @xcite also involve the construction of an induced map with summable return times , but in those papers the induced map has some very strong properties such as uniformly bounded distortion and the gibbs - markov property ( the image of each partition element maps diffeomorphically to the entire domain of definition of the induced map ) . to achieve these properties",
    "a quite complicated construction is required , involving the inductive definition of an infinite number of finer and finer partitions together with a combinatorial and probabilistic argument showing that the procedure eventually converges .",
    "besides the fact that we deal here with a significantly larger class of systems , a major difference is the construction of an induced map satisfying a different set of conditions as formalized in the summable variation property stated in the theorem .",
    "these induced maps do not necessarily have bounded distortion and there is no uniform lower bound for the size of the images .",
    "for this reason the construction of these induced maps is * much * simpler , and in fact can be fully achieved in less than two pages of text in the following section .",
    "the rest of the paper is just devoted to checking the required properties .",
    "the induced map @xmath77 can in fact be defined in complete generality with essentially no assumptions on the map @xmath7 .",
    "we will only require our assumptions to show that this induced map has the desired properties .      for a point @xmath32 in the neighbourhood @xmath78 of one of the critical points @xmath27 , we let @xmath79 for an arbitrary interval @xmath2 we let @xmath80 denote the length of @xmath2 and @xmath81 denote it s distance to the critical set @xmath82 , i.e. the minimum distance of all point in @xmath2 to @xmath34 . for each critical point @xmath27 with @xmath83 , and",
    "every integer @xmath84 we let @xmath85 it follows immediately from the summability condition ( @xmath53 ) that @xmath86      given @xmath87,we define the _ binding period _ of a point @xmath88 as follows .",

    ". otherwise we define the binding period as the _ smallest _ @xmath91 such that @xmath92 and @xmath93 , define @xmath94 to be the interval of points @xmath95 such that @xmath96 .",
    "observe that from the definition of binding it follows immediately that @xmath97 _ monotonically _ when @xmath98 .",
    "notice also that the interval @xmath94 may be empty and indeed that is the case , for instance , for all @xmath99 .      using the monotonicity of @xmath101 we can fix at this moment and for the rest of the paper @xmath100 sufficiently small so that    1 .",

    "we now fix an integer @xmath110 sufficiently large so that @xmath111 notice that the constants @xmath112 and @xmath113 come from the expansion outside the critical neighbourhoods given in section [ c2 ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath109 is motivated by the fact that any finite piece of orbit longer than @xmath109 iterations staying outside a @xmath100 neighbourhood of the critical points has an accumulated derivative of at least 2 .",

    "this completes the definitions of the induced map .",
    "in this section we prove a general formula relating the variation , the distortion and the expansion .",
    "first of all we define the notion of _ generalized distortion_. this is a very natural notion which is no more difficult to compute than standard distortion and which appears in variation calculations .",
