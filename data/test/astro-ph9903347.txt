    "the om basically consists of the _ quasar-370 _ enclosed in a transparent , nearly spherical pressure housing , see fig .",
    "the optical contact between the photocathode region of the tube and the pressure sphere is made by liquid glyzerine sealed with a layer of polyurethane .",
    "apart from the pmt , the om contains two hv supplies ( 25 kv and 2 kv ) for the hybrid pmt , a voltage divider , two preamplifiers , a calibration led and a vacuum probe .",
    "each om is electrically connected to the svjaska electronics module ( sem , see figs.1 and 15 ) by four electrical lines .",
    "they pass the signal driving the led from the sem to the om , and the pmt anode and dynode signal from the om to the sem .",
    "the fourth cable supplies the low voltages for the pmt hv - system and the preamplifier . a vacuum valve ( not shown in fig .",
    "11 ) allows to evacuate the sphere to 0.7 atm ( see section 4.2 ) .",

    "_ early approaches _    for the single string installations operated up to 1989 at lake baikal , cylindrical housings made from epoxy reinforced fiber glass have been used .",
    "these oms housed two 15-cm tubes with flat window , facing upward and downward , respectively .",
    "the pmts were covered with end caps made from plexiglas .",
    "limits on the flux of gut monopoles catalyzing baryon decay as well as a variety of limnologically relevant results have been obtained with single strings carrying these oms @xcite . with the advent of big hemispherical tubes",
    "this solution was discarded . in parallel to the tests of the early versions of the _ quasar _",
    "@xcite , we considered a pressure resistant phototube and tested pilot samples of appropriate glass spheres with 37 cm diameter and 0.8 - 1 cm wall thickness @xcite .",
    "however , in order to have more flexibility for future improvements of the phototube , we soon decided to use separate pmts and pressure housings .",
    "_ present design _",
    "traditional housings for large deep underwater instruments consist of two hemispheres whose equatorial surfaces are carefully ground to match each other .",
    "@xmath22 spheres are produced by benthos inc , usa , and jena - glass , germany ( vitrovex ) . in 1987 , together with the ekran company ( novosibirsk ) we started the design of an own pressure housing .",
    "it consists from the same s49 - 1 borosilicate glass used for the bulb of the _",
    "quasar-370_. its refractive index is 1.47 - 1.48 .",
    "since we developed the housings for our own purpose , we could optimize form and dimensions to fit the demands of the baikal experiment .",
    "the originally spherical form was elongated by adding a cylindrical part of 2 cm to the equator of each hemisphere .",
    "this allowed _",
    "i ) _ to avoid space problems when mounting the tube with its high voltage module into the housing and _ ii ) _ additionally to use the same housing for the underwater modules housing electronics crates .",
    "the elongated housing is superior to a sphere with bigger diameter since the layer of immersion material between tube bulb and pressure housing can be kept thinner .",
    "this as well as the small wall thickness ( 1.0 cm compared to 1.4 cm for benthos and vitrovex ) results in a low light absorbtion .",
    "the 1.4 cm spheres withstand a water depth of 6.7 km , the wall thickness of the ekran sphere is sufficient to work at all depths in lake baikal ( max .",
    "the transmission at 500 nm is 87 % for the ekran sphere , and 83 % for the other two spheres .    in order to simplify the construction of the metallic belt used to clamp the om to the string",
    ", the wall thickness at the equator was increased to 13 mm , forming a flange .",
    "the hermetization of the om along the equator is achieved by evacuating it via a special valve to 0.5 - 0.7 atm and sealing it by homogenizing adhesive tape .",
    "the immersion material filling the gap between the bulb of the phototube and the pressure housing should have _ a ) _ a good transparency , _ b ) _ an index of refraction close to that of glass and _ c ) _ high elasticity in order to protect the bulb from deformation of the pressure housing ( @xmath23 0.5 mm at 140 atm ) .    in the standard approach ,",
    "optically transparent silicon jelleys are used @xcite .",
    "we have developed an alternative , new method : the gap between tube and housing is filled with glyzerine and sealed by casting a liquid polyurethane compound to the glyzerine surface .",
    "the compound , being lighter than glyzerine , polymerizes and forms a stable sleeve .",
    "the sleeve prevents the glyzerine to leak into the back hemisphere of the om which houses the hv supplies and other electronic components .",
    "it fixes the position of the tube and at the same time does not prevent the minor displacements necessary to balance the pressure deformations of the housing .",
    "the advantages of this method are the following : _ a ) _ the index of refraction of glyzerine practically coincides with that of glass ( @xmath24 = 1.47 ) , _ b ) _ there is no `` delamination '' of the immersion material from the glass , a phenomenon easily appearing when working with jelley , _",
    "c ) _ the cost is low .",
    "the disadvantage is the risk that the polyurethane might leak in which case not only the optical contact is lost but also the glyzerine may corrode the electronics .    in parallel",
    ", we use the standard method which we tested first in 1992 .",
    "the gap is filled with a two - component silicon jelley ( semicosil , produced by wacker , germany ) with an index of refraction @xmath25 1.40 . eight oms ( vitrovex spheres ) with semicosil jelley were underwater for one year in 1992/93 , without showing any degradation of optical or mechanical characteristics .",
    "presently , we use vitrovex spheres and semicosil jelley for about 10 % of all oms .",
    "the transparencies of pressure housings , glyzerine and jelley are shown in fig .",
    "13 as a function of wavelength .",
    "the design of our connectors and penetrators started from the vacuum - proofed hf connector srg-50 - 863 produced in russia .",
    "the connector has an impedance of 50 ohms and withstands working voltages up , to 500 v and temperature extremes from -50@xmath26c to + 155@xmath26c .",
    "following the experience we had gained formerly with connectors produced by seacon ( usa ) , we modified the srg-50 - 863 for deep underwater applications .",
    "the new connector is hermetic up to a pressure of 200 atm .",
    "the outer screen is in electrical contact with water . in salt water",
    "this would result in strong electro - corrosion ; in fresh water , however , it is of negligible relevance .",
    "the hermetic connectors and penetrators developed in cooperation with the akin laboratory , moscow , can be operated at all depths of lake baikal , i.e. down to 1.7 km .",
    "the electronics , the trigger formation and the data aquisition system of the _ nt-200 _ telescope have been sketched in @xcite . here , we describe in more detail the front - end electronics which is closely connected to the operational principle of an om pair .",

    "the anode signal is fed to an amplifier ( 10x ) , the signal from the 11th dynode to an inverting amplifier ( 3x ) .",
    "the amplifiers are mounted to a printed board .",

    "_ b ) svjaska electronics module _",
    "the anode signals from the two _ quasars _ are processed by the _",
    "local trigger board_. it consists of two 2-level discriminators @xmath27 and @xmath28 as described in section 3 , one for each om , and a coincidence circuit .",
    "the threshold of @xmath27 is set to 0.25 @xmath29 , with @xmath29 being the mean pulse height of a ugon 1-p.e .",
    "the threshold of @xmath28 is remotely adjustable in the range 0.1  10 @xmath30 , with @xmath30 corresponding to 1 photoelectron emitted from the _",
    "quasar-370 _ photocathode .",
    "the output signal from @xmath27 has to be confirmed by a signal from @xmath28 ( coincidence in fig .",
    "the output pulses from @xmath27 have 15 nsec length and are switched in coincidence in a way , that the leading edge of the output signal ( _ `` local trigger '' _ ) is determined by the first of the two input signals . in this way ,",
    "late pulses are suppressed .",
    "the dynode signals of a pair of oms are led to the _ q - t _ module and summed by an analog summator .",
    "each summator input can be inhibited remotely ( i.e. each om can be excluded individually from the sum ) .",
    "the sum signal is processed by a charge - to - time converter based on the @xmath31-@xmath32 circuit 1101pd1 ( russian analogue to mqt-200 from lecroy ) .",
    "a local trigger would strobe the 1101pd1 , and the input charge is converted , with a maximum conversion time of 70 @xmath33sec .",
    "the width of the resulting signal corresponds to the charge of the dynode signal , the leading edge is set by the leading edge of the local trigger and defines the timing .",
    "the signal is sent to a string electronics module one level higher in the hierarchy and fed into tdcs which digitize the time ( 11 bit ) and the time - converted amplitude information ( 10bit ) @xcite .",
    "the _ q - t _ module can be operated in two modes .",
    "the first uses a time conversion factor just as high that a 1-p.e .",
    "signal corresponds to 1 channel of the amplitude digitizing tdc . in the second ( `` calibration '' ) mode ,",
    "the conversion time is stretched and one photoelectron corresponds to 20 tdc bins .",
    "in the course of the development the projects dumand and baikal , there have been long discussions about the advantages and drawbacks of operating the pmts as single detectors or as pairs .",
    "we have been favouring the pair principle due to the following reasons :    _ firstly _ , the average counting rate per pmt is _ in situ _ ( 0.5 - 1)@xmath34 hz and , due to bioluminescence , seasonally reaches ( 2 - 3)@xmath34 hz . the coincidence reduces the rate to 100 - 300 hz per pair typically .",
    "this low counting rate is of significant advantage for the following goals :    * _ data transmission and trigger formation _",
    "+ the hard local coincidence allows to transmit all local signals to the underwater array trigger module just above the detector , to form an overall trigger , to read out all signals and to transmit digitized times and amplitudes via wire cables to shore . due to the low rate",
    ", a simple underwater hardware trigger ( like e.g. `` @xmath35 3 local triggers in the whole array within 500 nsec '' ) already gives a sample nearly free of accidental coincidences .",
    "* _ track reconstruction _",
    "+ in experiments operating the pmts in single mode , background hits due to pmt noise , bioluminescence or k@xmath36 are mixed into practically every event @xcite .",
    "these hits have to be eliminated by various criteria and repeated fitting procedures rejecting those pmts with the highest time residuals .",
    "for the nt-200 detector , the average number of hits _ not _ due to the muon track is only 0.03/event , compared to about 10/event for an ocean experiment operating @xmath12 200 pmts in single mode @xcite .",
    "no coincidence between distant pmts reaches the noise hit rejection capabilities of the local coincidence , due to the small coincidence window of the latter . * _ search for slowly moving bright objects like magnetic gut monopoles _ + the detection principle is the registration of an excess in counting rates over time windows of the order of 10@xmath37 @xmath33sec .",
    "the rate excesses are buried in the noise signals if the pmt is operated in single mode .",
    "furthermore , non - poissonian fluctuations of a single pmt might fake a monopole event .",
    "noise rates as well as non - poissonian effects are effectively suppressed by the coincidence ( see fig .",
    "_ secondly _ , `` late pulses '' are strongly suppressed .",
    "these are pulses delayed by 10 - 100 nsec due to ( undetected ) elastical backscattering of the photoelectrons and multiplication after their second incidence on the dynode system .",
    "since it is rather unlikely that both pmts give a late pulse and since the response time is derived from the first pmt yielding a signal , only for a very small fraction of events the response time is that of a late pulse .",
    "the time resolution is on the one hand worsened since the azimuthal position of the pmt is unknown ( @xmath38 30 cm , i.e. 1.5 nsec light travel time in water ) , on the other hand , taking the time flag from the _ first _ hit pmt of a pair ( convolution of eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) sharpens the time resolution .",
    "the two effects almost balance each other .",
    "at least for the _ nt-200 _ project ( given the high external noise due to bioluminescence and the robust `` low - tech '' philosophy of the electronics and data transmission ) , these advantages prevail the drawbacks which are :    * a higher number of pmts in order to instrument the same volume , * a slightly higher threshold ( @xmath35 0.3 p.e . in _ each _ of the two pmts compared to @xmath35 0.3 p.e . in one pmt ) , * some mutual shadowing of the two oms of a pair . * possible signals in one pmt induced by the other pmt .",

    "we used a trigger telescope consisting of two tanks clamped to a string at a vertical distance of 6.5 m. the water volume in the tanks was optically shielded from the surrounding water , therefore the two flat - cathode pmts watching the tank interior were triggered only by cherenkov light from muons crossing the tank .",

    "19 , start and end point of the plateau , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are determined with an accuracy of 1 - 2 channels ( 1 - 2 nsec for a 10 bit tdc and @xmath65sec ) .",
    "the @xmath60 are given by @xmath66 , the flatness of the plateau determines the differential linearity of the tdc , which is better than 1 nsec in our case .",

    "this nitrogen laser , and a dye laser shifting the original wavelength of 337 nm to a spectrum peaking at 475 nm , are housed in a glas cylinder just above the telescope .",

    "20 shows the time difference distribution _",
    "after _ the correction procedure for the second and the sixth channel of the first string of the _",
    "nt-36 _ array .",
    "the fwhm of the laser peak is 2 nsec and the peak position is determined with an accuray better than one nsec .",
    "the right peak is due to downward going muons which had also triggered the two channels separated by 25 m ( @xmath76 nsec @xmath77 0.3 m / nsec ) .",
    "we observed a drift in the @xmath78 values over several months , presumably due to changes in the speed of light in the fiber under long - time pressure or water diffusion .",
    "these small effects can be corrected _ a posteriori _ by reconstructing muon tracks and requesting an average time residual like that observed in mc calculations .",
    "the overall accuracy of the time calibration is about 2 nsec .",
    "the first year of _ nt-36 _ has demonstrated the stability and reliability of all mechanical elements of the oms .",
    "none of the oms did leak , none of the polyurethane sealing layers and none of the quasar tubes have been damaged . until 1996 , nearly thousand penetrator / valve holes have been drilled in more than 130 spheres ( oms and electrical modules ) which afterwards have been operated over one to four years at 1.1 km depth .",
    "none of the feedthroughs did leak .",
    "only 2 spheres  in 1995  leaked slightly due to cracks which had developed after a year underwater .",
    "this effect was clearly due to a manufacturing error eliminated in the mean time .",
    "an unexpected problem was discovered with the power lines submitting300 v to the electronics modules . in 4 out of 30 connectors",
    "a parasitic current between the central wire and earth appeared , leading to strong electrolytic currents across the water to the string and particularly to the failure of the 1993 acoustic coordinate monitoring system driven via one of these connectors .",
    "the reason for this effect seems to be that , under the pressure of water , the plastificator from the pvc jacket is squeezed into the connector .",
    "this does not influence the functionality of the hf lines , but obviously leads to the formation conducting channels in the 300v connectors . in the mean time , the jackets of the cables have been improved an the effect has disappeared .",
    "another problem was the initially unacceptably high failure rate of some electronic components .",
    "the percentage of working channels , averaged over the full year , was only @xmath79 70% in 1993/94 ( _ nt-36 _ ) .",
    "( an array with a linearly decreasing number of living oms , starting with 100% and ending after a year with 50% living oms , would have @xmath80 = 75% . )",
    "losses where dominantly due to failures or misoperation of the hv supplies , secondly to failures of the @xmath81 controllers . with @xmath80 still only 75% in 1994/95",
    ", the year 1995 was used for a total re - design of the 25 kv supply .",
    "this , and changes at the 2 kv supply as well as at the controllers led to @xmath80 = 85 % for the 1996 array _",
    "nt-96_. the goal for the next years will be to increase @xmath80 up to 90 - 95% .",
    "for the oms alone this number is already nearly reached , and next improvements have to concentrate to other components of the detector .    in summary , the reliability optical module is suitable for long - term underwater operation in a 200 om array , taking into account that yearly repair of failed components is possible . for arrays larger by an order of magnitude , further significant improvements are desirable .      a phenomenon strongly influencing the sensitivity and , consequently , the counting rates of upward facing modules , is sedimentation of biomatter and dust on the upper hemispheres of the modules .",
    "21 shows the trigger rates for two different conditions over a period of 225 days , starting with april 13th , 1993 .",
    "firstly , for the case that at least 4 upward facing channels have been hit ( upper graph ) , secondly , for the condition that at least 4 downward facing channels have been hit ( lower graph ) .",
    "only channels operating all 225 days have been included . in the second case",
    ", one observes a slight decrease of the rates down to 85 - 90% of its original value .",
    "in contrast , the rate for the _ upward _ trigger falls down by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "the inspection of the spheres after one year of operation showed that sediments had formed a `` hat '' of bad transmission on the upward facing hemispheres ( see fig .",
    "the region near the equator was almost free of sediments .",
    "this suggests to describe the variation of the sensitivity @xmath82 of an optical module by the following formula :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the time after deployment in days .",
    "@xmath85 stands for the part of the sensitivity contributed by the equatorial region , the second term describes the top region with exponentially decreasing light transmission .    replacing the sensitivity @xmath86 used in the monte - carlo calculations by @xmath82",
    "as defined above , and fitting the resulting trigger rates to those experimentally measured in 1993 ( 1994 ) , one gets @xmath87 ( 0.36 ) and @xmath88 ( 102.0 ) days ( numbers in brackets are for the 1994 array",
    "_ nt-36@xmath89 _ ) .",
    "consequently , the sensitivity of an upward facing module to atmospheric muons decreases to 35@xmath45 after a year .",
    "both parameters change only slightly from year to year .",
    "note that the sensitivity of an upward facing om to upward going muons from neutrino interactions is influenced less , since in average for these tracks the equatorial part of the module is illuminated stronger than the top region .",
    "presently , we are looking for methods to reduce sedimentation effects .",
    "e.g. , the accumulation of sediments can be reduced by a smoother om surface or by dressing the om with a plexiglas cone ( see fig .",
    "the straight - forward solution is of course to direct all oms downward .",
    "this increases the sensitivity to upward muons from neutrino interactions by , slightly reduces the identification capabilities with respect to fake event ( downward muons faking upward muons ) , and limits the precision of downward muon physics . in the presently operating array _",
    "nt-200 _ , 160 of the 192 oms face downward .      during 4 years of data taking with the stepwise increasing stages of the baikal neutrino telescope",
    "we have accumulated technical and methodical experience as well as first relevant results .",
    "physics results from _",
    "nt-36 _ are reported in @xcite , and from _",
    "nt-96 _ in @xcite .",
    "the initial test an underwater telescope has to undergo is the correct reconstruction of atmospheric muons .",
    "they enter the array from above and are recorded with a frequency of several hz .",
    "24 shows a typical single muon event firing 7 of the 18 channels of _",
    "nt-36 _ and reconstructed with a @xmath90 .",
    "monte carlo calculations using as input the timing and amplitude properties of the _ quasar _ measured in laboratory do well reproduce the experimental data like amplitudes , time differences and angular distribution @xcite .",
    "the crucial demonstration of the functionality of a neutrino telescope is the identification of the rare neutrino events among the huge amount of atmospheric muons .",
    "their signature is given by a muon entering the array from _",
    "below_. still too small to detect the feable fluxes from extraterrestrial neutrino sources , _ nt-200 _ will be used to investigate those neutrinos which have been generated in the atmosphere in interactions of charged cosmic rays ( `` atmospheric neutrinos '' ) and to search for neutrinos due to dark matter annihilation in the center of the earth @xcite . in _",
    "nt-200 _ , about one neutrino per day will be recorded . with _",
    "nt-36 _ and _ nt-96 _ , 14 neutrino events have been identified , in accordance with monte carlo estimates .",
    "25 shows one `` gold plated '' event with 19 hits .",
    "we have constructed a deep underwater optical module ( om ) which is the key component of the neutrino telescope in lake baikal .",
    "most parts of the om , like the phototube _",
    "quasar-370 _ , the pressure sphere protecting the _ quasar _ , electronics as well as connectors and feedthroughs have been developed by our collaboration , in close cooperation with industry .    since 1993 ,",
    "we have been permanently operating configurations with a growing number of oms .",
    "a number of scientifically relevant results have been obtained , ranging from counting rate variations which reflect water transport processes to a precise measurement of the angular spectrum of atmospheric muons .",
    "most notably , first neutrino events have been unambiguously identified . during all years of data taking ,",
    "none of the pressure housing did leak , and the reliability of the oms has been improved continuously .    the 144-om array operated in 1997",
    "was upgraded to 192 oms in april 1998 . with this upgrade ( _ nt-200 _ ) , the short term goal of the collaboration is completed .    the technical solutions used until now turned out to be adequat for a first generation neutrino telescope like _ nt-200_. in the next step , we envisage a telescope consisting of 1000 - 2000 oms .",
    "for this telescope , the om design will change in various respects .",
    "firstly , an array much larger than _ nt-200 _ calls for higher reliability .",
    "some basic peculiarities of the baikal telescope may change .",
    "the present electronics was conceptually developed in 1988 - 1990 . clearly , a new design of the electroncis is necessary , using higher integrated circuitry , eventually omitting the `` svjaska electronics modules '' and moving the corresponding functions to the om or to the string electronics modules , making use of more advanced signal transmission techniques etc .",
    "almost for sure , a future om will have less feed - throughs in order to further minimize the danger of leaks .",
    "this , in turn , request changes in the electronics .",
    "for instance , one might be forced to omit the separate dynode read - out for amplitude mesurement and pay for that with a somewhat smaller dynamic range .    as an example for future develoments of the om we focus here on its main component , the _",
    "quasar_-tube .",
    "amplitude and timing characteristics of the _",
    "quasar-370 _ depend strongly on the ratio @xmath91 ( eq .",
    "we are investigating some new scintillator materials like scbo@xmath92:ce ( sbo ) , yalo@xmath92:ce ( yao ) and yclo@xmath9:ce ( yco ) , with 2 - 3 times larger light yield than y@xmath8sio@xmath9:ce ( yso ) and 28 - 30 ns decay time .",
    "we have manufactured each 5 pilot tubes with sbo and yao .",
    "the average gain values of the corresponding preamplifier tubes turned out to be twice as high as for fo yso , @xmath10 = 50 - 60 .",
    "the single photoelectron resolution is less than 50% and the time resolution about 1 nsec .",
    "technological improvements like the chemical protection of single scintillator grains are expected to give a larger gain @xmath10 in tubes with ordinary y@xmath8sio@xmath9:ce .",
    "other lines of improvement are directed to increase significantly the photocathode sensitivity and to decrease the dark current rate . for the present version ,",
    "the average dark current rate is about 35 khz at room temperature and half of that at 0@xmath26c .",
    "another line of principial re - design and improvement is the replacement of the scintillator screen and the small pmt by an diode array or by a foil first dynode followed by a mesh dynode chain .",
    "all these improvement make the _ quasar _ increasingly interesting to other fields apart from underwater telescopes , in particular for air - cherenkov telescopes .    as mentioned in section 5.2",
    ", we prefered a pairwise operation of oms by different reasons , most notably effective suppression of noise counts and elimination of prepulses , late pulse and afterpulses .",
    "however , for much larger projects the high cost of this approach may be not acceptable . in order to maintain the local coincidence and , at the same time , to reduce the number of oms ,",
    "we have developed a two - channel version of the _",
    "quasar_. we made use of the fact , that photoelectrons of the central part of the _ quasar _ are focussed onto the central spot of the luminescent screen , whereas photoelectrons from peripherical regions are collected onto the circular edge area of the screen .",
    "we have developed 2 pilot samples of a two - channel , small ( 3 cm diameter ) version of the ugon with a mesh dynode system , one channel collecting photoelectrons from the central region , the other from the periphery .",
    "the cross - talks measured are about 2% .",
    "switching the two channels in coincidence results in a noise rate as low as 100 hz .",
