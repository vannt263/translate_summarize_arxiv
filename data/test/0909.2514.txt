    "nonlinear interactions in @xmath1 materials have long been used to produce nonclassical light , including optical parametric amplifier sources of squeezed states @xcite , optical parametric oscillator sources of photon twin beams @xcite , and spontaneous parametric downconversion sources of polarization - entangled photon pairs @xcite . whereas gaussian - state quadrature statistics are invariably employed to understand the behavior of squeezed states and twin beams , the biphoton state is commonly used to describe downconverter experiments that employ coincidence counting and post - selection . yet , as shown in @xcite , there is a unified gaussian - state analysis capable of treating all of these nonclassical phenomena and more , e.g. , the dispersion cancellation experiment of steinberg _ et al . @xcite and the ghost imaging experiment of pittman _",
    "@xcite , both of which relied on biphoton explanations . recently , franson @xcite has argued that his dispersion cancellation paradigm @xcite differs from that of steinberg _ et al . in that",
    "the former is nonlocal whereas the latter is not .",
    "more importantly , in @xcite franson reviews various classical strawmen that have been suggested as providing explanations for nonlocal dispersion cancellation , and shows that each of them fails to reproduce one or more of the major features of quantum nonlocal dispersion cancellation .",
    "hence , he concludes that nonlocal dispersion cancellation is a fundamentally quantum effect akin to violation of bell s inequality . _ _ _    the list of classical strawmen that franson considers does _ not  include the classical gaussian state that most closely resembles the nonclassical gaussian state emitted by a continuous - wave downconverter . in this paper",
    "we will rectify that omission , and show that the key feature of nonclassical - state nonlocal dispersion cancellation that is not reproduced by this classical counterpart is the high - contrast nature of the photocurrent cross - correlation pattern .",
    "this result is in keeping with what we have previously established @xcite for the steinberg _",
    "experiment and for a similar comparison between classical - state and nonclassical - state ghost imaging , @xcite .",
    "in essence , we will see that nonlocal dispersion cancellation is a consequence of classical - physics propagation of the phase - sensitive cross correlation between the signal and reference beams through the dispersive elements , but the observability of the effect is greatly enhanced by the use of nonclassical light .",

    "ii apparatus when its signal and reference beams are in a zero - mean , continuous - wave , jointly gaussian state whose baseband field operators have phase - insensitive autocorrelations and a phase - sensitive cross correlation , but no phase - sensitive autocorrelations or phase - insensitive cross correlation .",
    "depending on the strength of the phase - sensitive cross correlation in comparison with the phase - insensitive autocorrelations , this state could be classical , i.e. , a classically - random mixture of coherent states for which the joint density operator has a proper @xmath0 representation and semiclassical photodetection may be employed @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it could be a nonclassical state , for which no proper @xmath0 representation exists and quantum photodetection is required to properly analyze the measurement statistics @xcite .",

    "iii when the joint state of the input beams either has a phase - sensitive cross correlation that is at the ultimate quantum limit , or that cross correlation saturates the tighter bound associated with classical physics .",
    "here we shall see that nonlocal dispersion cancellation occurs with both the nonclassical and classical states , but their contrasts differ dramatically . in sec .",

    "when the joint signal - reference field state has sufficiently low photon flux in each beam , the preceding photocurrents will consist of non - overlapping pulses representing individual photon detections , i.e. , operation is in the photon counting regime .",

    "all that remains , therefore is to examine the contrast between the dispersion - cancelled term and the accidentals . here",

    "the experiment requires quantum photodetection to exactly account for its behavior when @xmath165 , but semiclassical photodetection suffices when @xmath166 .",

    "it is state preservation for zero - mean jointly gaussian states with a phase - sensitive cross correlation  implied by classical coherence - theory propagation of that cross correlation  that is responsible for the nonlocal dispersion cancellation in the fig .  1 experiment .    in short ,",
    "our gaussian - state analysis supports franson s assertion from @xcite : there is no classical explanation that can account for _ all  the features of his nonlocal dispersion - cancellation experiment .",
