    "it has become a widespread practice to study the physics of systems in various numbers of spatial dimensions , not necessarily @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , graphene with @xmath1 , and string or membrane theory with @xmath2 as high as @xmath3 , are two examples that immediately come to mind for both their experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "moreover , geometric ideas provide a common framework used to pursue such studies .",
    "a pedagogical goal of this paper is to encourage students to think along these lines in the context of a familiar subject  electrostatics .",
    "for example , in three spatial dimensions a uniformly charged straight - line segment gives rise to an electric potential @xmath4 whose equipotential surfaces are prolate ellipsoids of revolution about the segment , with the ends of the segment providing the foci of the ellipsoid .",
    "as an immediate consequence of the geometry for these prolate ellipsoidal equipotentials , the associated electric field  @xmath5  always normal to surfaces of constant @xmath4  has at any observation point a direction that bisects the angle formed by the pair of lines from the observation point to each of the two foci of the ellipsoid .",
    "this beautiful electrostatic example was presented by george green in 1828 @xcite , and it has been discussed in many books since then @xcite-@xcite including at least two texts from this century @xcite .  while the straight - line segment is an idealization , nevertheless it provides insight into the behavior of real thin - wire conductors , especially upon approximating those real wires as very narrow , needle - like  ellipsoids .",
    "but as it turns out , the line segment problem in three dimensions is a very special case , in some sense the most ideal of all possible electrostatic worlds .  in any _ other _ dimension of space , uniformly charged segments",
    "do * not * produce ellipsoidal equipotentials .",
    "conversely , in any other dimension , if the equipotentials are ellipsoidal about a linearly distributed straight - line segment of charge , then that charge distribution can * not * be uniform .",
    "one need look no farther than two dimensional systems to see clearly that there are differences between uniformly charged segments and those with charge distributed so as to produce ellipsoidal equipotentials .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 is the only ellipsoidal equipotential case which is intuitive in the sense that the associated linear charge distribution has maxima at the ends of the segment , as one might naively expect from the repulsive force between like charges placed on a segment of a real , thin conductor at a finite potential .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of charge needed to produce ellipsoidal equipotentials is counter - intuitive in higher dimensions .",
    "to produce such equipotentials for @xmath6 the charge distribution must have a maximum at the center and vanish at the ends of the segment .",
    "we begin our discussion in section 2 in two dimensions , where the two types of charged segments are readily analyzed .",
    "then we compare and contrast uniformly charged line segments with those admitting ellipsoidal equipotentials for any number of spatial dimensions .  as a preliminary , we first discuss briefly in section 3 the potential of a point charge in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "we then use this information in section 4 to compute the potentials and electric fields for uniformly charged line segments .",
    "we continue in section 5 by considering systems with ellipsoidal equipotentials in @xmath2  dimensions .",
    "we then determine the linear charge distributions that produce such potential configurations , and we find the remarkable result that the linear charge density giving rise to ellipsoidal equipotentials is peaked at the center of the segment , for @xmath6 .",
    "the discussion of general @xmath2 affords the opportunity to illustrate how continuous @xmath2 can be used as a mathematical device to regulate singular behavior .",
    "this too is a widespread practice in theoretical physics .",
    "we use @xmath2 in this way in section 5 of the paper to interpolate continuously between intuitive and counter - intuitive charge distributions for segments with ellipsoidal equipotentials .     finally , in section 6 , we invoke well - known methods to indicate how the various line segment results also give solutions to a class of electrostatic boundary value problems where the charge is moved outward and distributed on one of the equipotential surfaces that surrounds the original segment .",
    "the point - particle electric potential in 2d is well - known to be logarithmic .  for a point charge @xmath7 located at the origin , up to a constant @xmath8 that sets the distance scale , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the two dimensional analogue of coulomb s constant .",
    "by linear superposition , a finite length , uniformly charged line segment , with constant charge / length @xmath11 distributed on the @xmath12 axis for @xmath13 , produces a potential @xmath14 this result may be established by integrating the contributions of infinitesimal point - like bits of charge that make up the segment , using ( [ 2dpointcharge ] ) and the indefinite integral @xmath15 written out in full,@xmath16 a plot of the potential surface shows the essential features .",

    "that is to say , @xmath87 the change of variables needed to obtain ( [ efieldpunchline ] ) will be discussed more fully below , for non - uniformly charged segments giving rise to ellipsoidal equipotentials in any number of dimensions .",
    "a direct graphical comparison of the uniformly charged segment and the non - uniformly charged segment in 2d is obtained by superimposing their equipotentials in a true orthogonal projection of the @xmath4 surface contours onto the @xmath27-plane .",

    "so asymptotically both sets of contours become circles .  regarding this ,",
    "recall the total charge on either segment under consideration is the same , namely , @xmath96 .",
    "thus for large distances from the segment the equipotentials in figure 13 will coalesce , although it is perhaps surprising how rapidly this occurs .  in figure 13",
    "the equipotential contours for both the uniform and non - uniform charge distributions , for the same value of @xmath4 , are very nearly coincident if @xmath97  the exact locations of the two sets of contours never differ by more than a few percent if @xmath97  well before the contours reach their asymptotic circular form .",
    "for a point charge @xmath7 located at the origin of coordinates , in @xmath98 dimensions , the scalar potential at an observation point @xmath99  is hypothesized to be @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath10 is the @xmath2-dimensional analogue of coulomb s constant .",

    "so for @xmath1 the point particle potential is logarithmic , as previously noted in section 2 .",
    "perhaps the simplest convention would be to set @xmath112 which would require , for @xmath98,@xmath113 this is singular at @xmath1 where the potential is a logarithm , not a power .",

    "the potential has no dependence on the additional @xmath141 angles needed to specify the location of a point in @xmath2 dimensions using spherical polar coordinates .",

    "this is not so  the charge density is uniform  but then the segment itself is at an infinite @xmath4 so physical intuition based on real conductors is perhaps difficult to apply in this situation @xcite .  in higher dimensions , the result is even _ more _ counter - intuitive for idealized line segments .",

    "finite _ constant , so there is nothing pathological about the potential that might obviate physical intuition based on real conductors .",
    "on the other hand , all @xmath6 behave counter - intuitively , with @xmath268 peaked at the center of the segment and vanishing at the segment ends .",
    "and for all @xmath6 the potential along the segment , as given by ( [ 3pointpotential ] ) , is _ infinite _ , so real - world physical intuition is not guaranteed to be reliable for these idealized situations .",
    "the uniformly charged 3d case , also with infinite @xmath4 along the segment , acts as a separatrix between intuitive and counter - intuitive charge distributions .",

    "as shown in figure 14 of section 4 , the results are@xmath275@xmath276 where @xmath154 is the transverse distance from the segment and @xmath153 is the @xmath147-coordinate of the observation point , and where @xmath277 is a unit vector pointing from the location @xmath278  of the bit of charge on the segment to the observation point @xmath99 .",
    "now , using the charge distribution ( [ chargedistribution ] ) that produces ellipsoidal equipotentials , we eventually obtain@xmath279@xmath280 where we have changed integration variables from @xmath147 to an angle @xmath176 according to@xmath281 note that @xmath176 here is the polar angle _ measured from the location of the bit of charge _ , and in general this is not the @xmath143 shown in figure 14 of section 4 .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath282 and @xmath283 _ are _ the angles shown in figure 14 .",
    "these last relations , in particular ( [ crucialid ] ) and ( [ electricfieldthetaintegral ] ) , are useful to establish _ the direction _ _ of the electric field _ _ without actually performing the integration_.  to verify this statement , let @xmath284 in ( [ electricfieldthetaintegral ] )  to find@xmath285 the integration here weights @xmath78 by an _ even _ function of @xmath83 , with the range of integration symmetric about @xmath84 , so it follows that the resulting direction of @xmath286 will be proportional to @xmath287 .  that is to say , at any observation point around the segment the direction of @xmath288 bisects the angle formed by the two lines from the end points of the segment to the observation point , thereby confirming that the equipotentials are ellipsoids of revolution about the segment .",
    "note that this direct calculation of @xmath288 using the integral expression ( [ elineind ] ) generalizes prior calculations  for @xmath0 where the charge density is uniform , as given in @xcite , to cases where the charge distribution on the segment is _ not _ uniform for @xmath233 .",
    "we leave it as an exercise for the reader to evaluate the integral in ( [ elineind ] ) to obtain explicit expressions , and to show that these are in agreement with @xmath289 .  even before attempting to evaluate the integral in ( [ elineind ] ) , however , it should be evident that a determination of @xmath288 by taking the gradient of the potential is easier to carry through .",
    "having found the equipotentials for various charged line segments , we have in hand a set of solutions for a variety of electrostatic boundary value problems .",
    "if all the charge from the line segment is moved outward along electric field lines and placed on a single surface selected from among the equipotentials , in such a way as to preserve @xmath4 on that surface , then the surrounding equipotentials are unchanged as well .",
    "this is widely known , and was in fact a feature emphasized by green @xcite .",
    "the charge distribution on the selected surface , as required to carry out this feat , is of course given by the electric field normal to that surface as provided by the original charged line segment solution .",
    "in particular , ellipsoidal equipotentials in any @xmath2 yield hypersurface charge densities that are expressible as elementary functions .",
    "the results are straightforward generalizations of the well - known 3d ellipsoidal case .",
    "in fact , it is not even necessary for the hyperellipsoids to be surfaces of revolution .  for a general ellipsoid , as defined in @xmath2 dimensions by @xmath290 the charge distribution on that hyperellipsoid such that it is an equipotential is given by@xmath291 this can be established by a straightforward adaptation of the argument that applies to the 3d case , as given for example in smythe @xcite , chapter 5 ,  5.00-5.02 .",
    "if this charged hyperellipsoidal surface is squashed  to obtain an equipotential hyperdisk ( see smythe  5.03 for the 3d case ) , say by letting @xmath292 while maintaining the constraint ( [ ellipsoidd ] ) , then the hypersurface charge density on the resulting hyperdisk ( counting charge on both sides of the disk ) becomes@xmath293 this charge distribution may now be projected along any of the remaining unsquashed principal axes of the original ellipsoid by elementary integrations .",
    "the final result is exactly the linear charge distribution given by ( [ chargedistribution ] ) , namely , @xmath294 where the projection has been made onto the @xmath10th axis .",
    "alternatively , the surface charge distribution ( [ ellipsoidsurfacecharge ] ) of the unsquashed ellipsoid may be projected directly without being squashed , again by elementary integrations , to obtain the same result for @xmath295 .",
    "in the context of a familiar subject  electrostatics  we have carried out several elementary calculations in various numbers of spatial dimensions , @xmath2 , to encourage students to think more critically about the role played by @xmath2 .",
    "although for @xmath0 a uniformly charged straight - line segment gives rise to an electric potential @xmath4 whose equipotential surfaces are prolate ellipsoids of revolution about the segment , with the ends of the segment providing the foci of the ellipsoid , this is a very special case .",
    "if @xmath233 , uniformly charged segments do not produce ellipsoidal equipotentials .  if @xmath233 , a non - uniform distribution of charge is required to produce equipotentials that are ellipsoidal about a straight - line segment of charge .",
    "we have illustrated these @xmath233 features in detail for @xmath1 and @xmath185 , and we have provided a framework as well as explicit formulas to carry through the same level of detail for any @xmath2 .  we have shown how @xmath1 is the only ellipsoidal equipotential case which is intuitive in the sense that the associated linear charge distribution has maxima at the ends of the segment , as one might naively expect .",
    "in contrast , we have shown that the distribution of charge needed to produce ellipsoidal equipotentials is counter - intuitive for @xmath6 , becoming all the more so as @xmath2 is increased , in the sense that the requisite charge distribution has an absolute maximum at the center of the segment and vanishes at its ends .     for @xmath0 and @xmath185 ,",
    "the potential surface plots were found to have similar features that can be distinguished only by careful inspection .",
    "differences in @xmath4 between uniformly charged line segments and those giving rise to ellipsoidal equipotentials were shown to be somewhat subtle .",
    "distinctions between the two cases were more easily drawn by examining the corresponding electric fields close to the segment , or , relatedly , by directly comparing the charge densities .",
    "we also took the opportunity to illustrate , albeit briefly , how continuous @xmath296 can be viewed as a mathematical tool to regulate singular behavior and to interpolate between intuitive and counter - intuitive charge distributions .  in the course of our discussion",
    ", we employed some basic geometrical ideas at an elementary level , such as in the determination of the direction of the electric field associated with ellipsoidal equipotentials .    finally , we indicated how the line segment results may be generalized to solve a class of electrostatic boundary value problems by distributing the charge on hypersurfaces , rather than straight lines , while maintaining the line segment equipotentials outside the charged hypersurface .                            for more on the history of the 3d line segment problem , including citations of some recent pedagogical papers on the subject , see t s van kortryk , on the fields due to line segments  arxiv:1410.6832 [ physics.hist-ph ] .    throughout our discussion",
    "we use rectangular cartesian , spherical polar , and cylindrical coordinates , in view of student familiarity with these coordinate systems , even though prolate ellipsoids of revolution are more naturally described in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates .     it is tempting to introduce the variable @xmath297 ,",
    "the coordinate locally orthogonal to @xmath47 in a prolate spheroidal coordinate system .",
    "this would make the result for @xmath62  just as compact as that for @xmath190 when the equipotentials are ellipsoidal",
    ".  however , the results are sufficiently manageable in terms of rectangular cartesian coordinates , at least for graphical purposes , that there is no real numerical advantage achieved by using prolate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "beginning students can appreciate why the normal to a prolate ellipsoidal surface bisects the angle formed by the two vectors from the foci to any point on the ellipsoid by thinking about the law of reflection applied to a light ray that strikes an ellipsoidal mirror while en route from one focus to the other .",
    "alternatively , a few banked shots on any good ellipsoidal billiard table should clarify the situation .",
    "the form in ( [ alternate3pointpotential ] ) is also more useful to obtain the correct result for @xmath1 since the form in ( [ 3pointpotential ] ) requires taking a limit @xmath298 to obtain a nontrivial result .",
