    "the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ) ( oliver et al . 2012 ) is a guaranteed time key program on the _ herschel _ space observatory ( pilbratt et al .",
    "it has a wedding cake survey design which consists of nested fields ranging from shallow and wide fields to deep and narrow fields observed with the _ herschel_-spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; griffin et al .",
    "2010 ) at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 are also known as the spire photometer short wavelength array ( psw ) , spire photometer median wavelength array ( pmw ) and spire photometer long wavelength array ( plw ) respectively . ] and the _ herschel_-photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; poglitsch et al .",
    "2010 ) at 100 and 160 @xmath2 for a subset of the hermes fields .",
    "there are 13 target blank fields at approximately seven different depths ( levels 1 - 7 ) covering a total area of @xmath0380 deg@xmath1 which include a later addition of a wide hermes large - mode survey ( helms ) field ( 270 deg@xmath1 ) observed by spire alone .",
    "in addition to the blank fields , hermes also targeted 12 known clusters .",
    "the first two data releases , early data release ( edr , july 1 , 2010 ) and edr2 ( september 19 , 2011 ) , included spire high signal - to - noise ( @xmath3 ) sources extracted from hermes science demonstration phase ( sdp ) and the first data release ( dr1 ) fields ( see table 1 ) generated by the sussextractor ( sxt ) point source extractor ( smith et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as spire maps in the abell 2218 cluster field .",
    "this paper describes the generation of hermes point source catalogues extracted from _",
    "herschel_-spire observations completed by may 1 , 2010 and released during the first extensive data release ( dr1 ) of maps and catalogues ( march 27 , 2012 ) and all observations except helms released during the second extensive data release ( dr2 ; october 31 , 2013 ) .",
    "details of dr1 and dr2 are given in table 1 and 2 .",
    "as catalogues are the starting point for understanding the far - infrared / sub - millimetre ( sub - mm ) galaxy population in detail ( e.g. their spectral energy distributions , redshift distribution and luminosity ) , a lot of effort has been invested in constructing deep and reliable catalogues . the main challenge is confusion noise which arises when the spatial extent of the emission from distinct sources overlap within the same area , creating signal fluctuations within the telescope beam . at a given wavelength ,",
    "this will mostly depend on the intrinsic flux density distribution of sources as well as the resolving power and sensitivity of the instrument used for the observations .",
    "nguyen et al . ( 2010 ) found that in the limit of infinite integration time ( i.e. negligible instrumental noise ) the spire confusion noise is at the level of @xmath4 mjy at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 , respectively ( after excluding map pixels at @xmath5 ) .",
    "confusion noise is a significant feature ( much larger than instrumental noise ) for most of the hermes fields ( from level 1 to level 4 ; see table 1 and 2 ) and sets a fundamental limit on the flux limit of sources that can be detected by a peak finding algorithm such as sxt .",
    "bright sources that can be resolved individually by _ herschel _ only account for a small fraction of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) ( e.g. oliver et al . 2010",
    "; glenn et al . 2010 ; bethermin et al . 2012 ) . to extract deeper catalogues , we must reduce the level of confusion noise in our maps . in this paper",
    ", we present a new source detection and photometry method which combines an iterative source detection algorithm starfinder ( sf ) and a de - blended spire photometry ( desphot ) algorithm . sf iteratively",
    "detects and removes sources to reduce the confusion noise level and therefore can extract sources below the nominal confusion limit .",
    "desphot is optimised for accurate photometry in highly confused images .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , first we describe spire observations and the extracted data products of the hermes fields released in dr1 and dr2 .",
    "then , we describe in detail the two different source extraction methods ( sxt and sf combined with desphot ) used to generate the dr1 and dr2 point sources catalogues . in section 3 ,",
    "realistic end - to - end _",
    "herschel_-spire simulations are used to understand the basic properties ( e.g. photometric and positional error , completeness , and reliability ) of the point source catalogues .",
    "the issue of extended sources being broken up by our source extraction methods is discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , we give conclusions and discussions in section 5 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : flux_prob ]      having matched the input and output catalogue , we can look at the photometric accuracy of the extracted sources . in fig .",
    "[ fluxunc ] , we plot the output - input flux difference ( @xmath6 ) to input flux ( @xmath7 ) ratio for extracted sources in different bins of input flux density at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 , for the three different types of source catalogues ( sxt , sf and sf250 ) in the simulated unclustered cosmos and lockman - swire field . simulations with clustered input sources give similar results . at the faint end ( @xmath8 limit ) , the output flux is generally larger than the input flux ( the well - known flux - boosting effect ) and the level of flux - boosting increases with decreasing input flux . at the bright end ( flux densities @xmath9 limit ) , the mean flux difference to input flux ratio @xmath10 stays close to zero ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fluxunc ] ) with an increasing scatter towards deceasing input flux . for each of the three types of source catalogues ,",
    "the ratio @xmath10 deviates from the dashed line at a larger @xmath7 value in the simulated lockman - swire field than the cosmos field , due to a higher level of instrument noise in the former ( see table 2 ) . for the band - merged sf catalogues ( sf250 ) extracted at the positions of sf 250 @xmath2 sources , the ratio @xmath10 deviates from the dashed line at a much smaller @xmath7 value at 350 and 500 @xmath2 compared to the independent single - band sxt or sf catalogues , as a result of reduced confusion noise .",
    "we fit a geometric function of the form @xmath11 to describe the relation between the mean flux difference to input flux ratio as a function of input flux density . here",
    "@xmath12 is negative .",
    "so , as the input flux @xmath7 increases to a very large number , the flux difference to input flux ratio asymptotes to @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath12 describes how quickly the flux difference to input flux ratio rises ( i.e. deviates from the asymptotic value @xmath13 ) as a function of decreasing @xmath7 and @xmath15 is related to the input flux density at which @xmath16 starts to deviate from @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , @xmath12 describes the rate of deviation and @xmath15 is related to the deviation point . in table 4 , we list the best - fit values for the parameters in the geometric function at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 averaged over all five simulated fields , both clustered and unclustered . in all cases , @xmath13 is consistent with zero which means for the bright input sources there is no systematic bias in the flux estimation in the sxt , sf and sf250 catalogues .",
    "we can see that averaged over different fields the rate of deviation @xmath13 is similar across different bands for the sxt and sf catalogues .",
    "the sf250 catalogues have a higher rate of deviation ( i.e. steeper rise ) and lower deviation point compared to the sxt and sf catalogues at 350 and 500 @xmath2 .",
    "simulations with clustered input sources give in general similar results to the unclustered simulations but with a slightly higher deviation point . in table 5",
    ", we list the interpolated output - input flux difference to input flux ratio at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 as a function of input flux based on the best - fit geometric function in the unclustered simulation of the cosmos , eroth , uds , elais - s1 and lockman - swire field .",
    "clustered simulations give similar output - input flux difference to input flux ratio .",
    "completeness fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of input sources matched with sources in the output catalogue ( i.e. detected input sources ) to the total number of input sources in a given flux interval . as such",
    ", completeness fraction is defined as a function of input flux . after matching the input catalogue with the output catalogue as detailed in section 3.2 ,",
    "it is straightforward to derive the completeness curve for each of our simulations .",
    "input sources that are linked to more than one output source are counted only once to avoid double counting . fig .",
    "[ comp ] compares the completeness curves from sxt , sf and sf250 catalogues at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 in the simulated unclustered cosmos and lockman - swire field . in deep fields , sf catalogues are deeper than the sxt fields . in shallower fields ,",
    "the opposite is true .",
    "a higher level of instrument noise in the shallow fields means that fewer sources would pass the correlation test between the source profile and the prf in the sf source detection method . for a given source extraction method ( sxt or sf )",
    ", the completeness fraction at a given flux density drops as the level of instrument noise increases .",
    "simulations with clustered sources produce similar completeness curves as a function of input flux .",
    "to fit the completeness fraction as a function of input flux density , we can use the generalised logistic function @xmath17 we can set @xmath18 ( the lower asymptote ) and @xmath19 ( the upper asymptote ) as the completeness fraction @xmath20 should approach 100% and 0% when @xmath7 goes to very large and very small values respectively . in table 6 , we list the interpolated completeness level at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 as a function of input flux based on the best - fit generalised logistic function in the unclustered simulation of the cosmos , eroth , uds , elais - s1 and lockman - swire field .",
    "clustered simulations give similar results .",
    "our source detection and extraction methods assume point sources .",
    "objects that are extended on the scale of the spire beam ( see fig .  [ extendedsources ] ) are not expected to be accurately represented .",
    "the sxt detection and extraction will lead to inaccurate flux estimation ( probably biased low ) and very large objects may be misidentified as multiple point sources . similarly , sf will underestimate fluxes and is expected to break even modestly extended object into multiple point sources .",
    "we have thus flagged detections as extended using the following criteria .",
    "we have cross - matched all spire detections with their nearest ( within 30 ) counterpart in the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc , jarrett et al .",
    "any detection matched to a counterpart with a k fiducial kron elliptical aperture semi - major axis @xmath21 9  is flagged as extended .",
    "we have then cross - matched all spire detections with sources in the new catalogue of principal galaxies ( pgc2003 ) which constitutes the hyperleda database @xmath22-mag .",
    "hyperleda ( http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr ) provides the richest catalogue of homogeneous parameters of galaxies for the largest available sample , and is thus useful when trying to estimate galaxy sizes in an homogeneous manner . ]",
    "( paturel et al , 2003 ) .",
    "a counterpart is identified where a 30  radius circle around the spire position intersects with the 25 @xmath22-mag / arcsec@xmath1 isophotal ellipse .",
    "any detection with a counterpart with diameter at this isophot ( d25 ) @xmath21 18   is flagged as extended .",
    "these scales were chosen as they correspond to the fwhm of the spire beam at 250 @xmath23 m and could conservatively reproduce other classifications , i.e. all objects which we have identified as bright and extended or nearby by eye and clusters of four or more sf detections . this procedure flags 6,169 spire detections as extended .",
    "the number of detections is much larger than the number of extended galaxies they represent as the detections include objects detected by either of the two techniques , in any spire band , and multiple components of a single galaxy .",
    "another test which informed and supplemented our flagging method was an analysis of spire detected sources with a poor prf fit at the position of the spitzer 24 @xmath23 m position . visual inspection revealed those detections appeared to be extended .",
    "most of these ( @xmath090% ) have already been flagged as extended by the methods described above .",
    "the remaining 10% ( 200 detections ) were then also flagged as extended which brings the total number of extended sources to 6,369 .",
    "however , this additional safety check has only been done in regions with spitzer 24 @xmath23 m data .",
    "in this paper , we present independent single - band sussextractor ( sxt ) and starfinder ( sf ) point source catalogues as well as band - merged sf catalogues ( sf250 ) extracted at the positions of the sf 250 @xmath23 m sources released in hermes dr1 and dr2 . for sf and sf250 catalogues ,",
    "we use our own code desphot for accurate photometry .",
    "end - to - end simulations with realistic number counts and clustering behaviour matched to the observed counts and power spectra of the spire sources are generated to characterise the basic properties of the source catalogues .",
    "we use a likelihood ratio method to match the simulated input sources with the output sources .",
    "the matched input and output catalogues are estimated to have a false identification rate of @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the positional distribution of real matches between the input and output peaks at approximately 5 , 8and 13  at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 for sxt catalogues , and approximately at 5 , 7and 12  at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath2 for sf catalogues .",
    "both source extraction methods ( sxt and sf ) return unbiased flux measurement for bright sources at @xmath9 ( with respect to the total noise including confusion noise and instrument noise ) .",
    "for faint sources , the output flux systematically overestimates the input flux and the level of flux - boosting ( the output - input flux difference to input flux ratio ) increases rapidly with decreasing input flux . at a given input flux , the level of flux boosting also increases with the level of instrument noise .",
    "the completeness fraction as function of input flux is also characterised for the three different types of source catalogues based on our simulations . in the deep fields , sf catalogues are generally deeper than the sxt catalogues . in the shallower fields with a higher instrument noise level , the opposite is true . by construction ,",
    "the sf250 catalogues are deeper than the independent sf catalogues at 350 and 500 @xmath2 but it will miss sources which are only detected at 350 and/or 500 @xmath2 .",
    "fitting formulae for the positional accuracy , photometric accuracy and completeness fraction are given in the paper .",
    "we find that the impact of source clustering on the positional and photometric accuracy as well as the completeness fraction is small .",
