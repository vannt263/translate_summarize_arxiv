    "<S> we are concerned with few - particle correlations in a fermionic system at finite temperature and density . within the many - body green functions </S>",
    "<S> formalism the description of correlations is provided by the dyson equation approach that leads to effective few - body equations . </S>",
    "<S> they contain the dominant medium effects , which are self energy corrections and the pauli blocking . </S>",
    "<S> hence the effective two - body interactions between quasiparticles are momentum / energy - dependent and therefore they can be usesed in the medium modified , momentum space , integral ags equations for three- and four - body systems . to investigate correlations and clusters beyond four - body , we employ , instead , the configuration space two - variable integro - differential equations ( idea ) for @xmath0-body bound systems which are based on hyperspherical harmonics and the faddeev decomposition of the wave function in two - body amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the transformation of the energy dependent two - body interactions to equivalent local , energy independent , ones . </S>",
    "<S> to achieve this we use inverse scattering techniques the resulting interactions being , on and ( to all practical purposes ) off  shell equivalent to the energy dependent potentials . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we obtain binding energy results for the 2 , 3 , 4 , and 16particle in a medium at a finite temperature and various densities . </S>",
    "<S> several aspects of the problem are discussed and the behavior of the potential surfaces obtained in the extreme adiabatic approximation , below and above the mott transition , is investigated . </S>"
