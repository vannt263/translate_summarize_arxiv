    "what we would like to do in this paper is to generalize the above construction to critical strings .",
    "since the solitonic operator @xmath22 generates boundaries on the worldsheet , we should use the creation and annihilation operators of the critical strings whose wave functions are proportional to the boundary states , in place of @xmath24 and @xmath23 in the above construction . in ref.@xcite , it was shown that the boundary states @xmath27 satisfy the idempotency equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the product corresponding to a light - cone gauge type three string vertex .",

    "therefore the three string vertex for such states is essentially the same as the one in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : stochastic ] ) for noncritical strings .",
