    "as one of the oldest stellar populations in our galaxy , globular clusters are key to understanding the earliest epochs of galaxy evolution and stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "globular clusters may therefore contain unique chemical markers of the first generations of stars .",
    "all globular clusters indeed show abundance peculiarities compared with the typical field population , such as an o - na anti - correlation , which is normally interpreted as reflecting two or more generations of stars in the clusters with the first one sharing the chemical composition with normal field stars of the same metallicity @xcite .",
    "the nature of the polluter of the later generations of stars is still being debated with intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars or rapidly rotating massive stars the leading contenders . as the polluters would be part of the first cluster generation , some of which are still present , they would thus not be metal - free population iii stars but population ii stars of the same metallicity as the cluster as a whole . until recently there have been no convincing observations of population iii nucleosynthesis in any globular cluster star but @xcite claim to have found exactly such a smoking gun in ngc6522 .",
    "ngc6522 is a little studied globular cluster in the milky way s bulge .",
    "observations of individual stars in this cluster are difficult due to the large crowding of more metal - rich bulge stars and foreground disk contamination in this region as well as the heavy interstellar extinction and reddening characteristic of sight lines of the galactic bulge , especially near the plane",
    ". however , this is a particularly important globular cluster because it may be the oldest globular cluster in the milky way @xcite and it may contain vital clues to the formation and early evolution of the still poorly understood bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently analysed eight potential ngc6522 cluster members and found remarkably high abundances of slow neutron - capture elements , distinct from any other globular cluster observed .",
    "the authors demonstrated that such a chemical abundance pattern would be consistent with the nucleosynthesis predicted for rapidly rotating massive , extremely metal - poor or population iii stars , so - called spinstars @xcite .",
    "the fact that this cluster is so far unique in carrying such a nucleosynthetic signature may reflect that the very first stars born after the big bang formed in the largest over - densities , which subsequently grew with time to become centres of galaxies .",
    "the oldest galactic stars should therefore be concentrated in the bulge region @xcite , which also experienced the most rapid chemical enrichment due to the intense star formation rate , making it conceivable that any population iii chemical fingerprint may preferentially show up in an old bulge cluster with @xmath0 } \\approx -1 $ ] such as ngc6522 .",
    "given the potentially far - reaching implications of the work of @xcite , we present a re - analysis of the same cluster stars but importantly with a more detailed accounting of blending lines as well as isotopic hyperfine splitting of the @xmath2-process abundance diagnostics .",
    "the giraffe / vlt data from the program 071.b-0617(a ) ( pi = a .",
    "renzini ) were downloaded from the eso archive .",
    "these observations were taken during may - july 2003 and comprised of two field pointings and three wavelength settings : hr13 ( 612 - 640 nm ) , hr14 ( 638.3 - 662.6 nm ) and hr15 ( 679.7 - 696.5 nm ) .",
    "a more comprehensive description of the data can be found in @xcite .",
    "a number of calibration frames were missing from the eso archive but were provided by eso support upon request .",
    "we could not locate all of the data corresponding to the total exposure times reported in @xcite for unknown reasons .",
    "the available data were reduced using gasgano ( version 1.24 ) with the wavelength calibration verified using skylines and telluric lines .",
    "the data were sky subtracted using an automated python routine that determined a median sky from the available sky fibres and removed it from each science frame . for each wavelength setting , separate frames were co - added . the resulting signal - to - noise ( @xmath3 ) ratio per resolution element for the three wavelength settings",
    "are listed in table [ tab : vels ] .",
    "the stellar radial velocities were determined from a cross - correlation with a theoretical model atmosphere spectrum ( corresponding to @xmath4k , @xmath5 [ cgs ] , [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) smoothed to the resolving power of the observations using the routine fxcor in pyraf .",
    "bad pixels and telluric regions were masked out for this procedure .",
    "our measured radial and heliocentric velocities are listed in table [ tab : vels ] .",
    "the mean heliocentric velocity we report for these nine candidate ngc6522 stars is @xmath7 km s@xmath8 , which is in reasonable agreement with the value quoted by @xcite : @xmath9 km s@xmath8 .",
    "it is possible that some of the candidate stars may not be cluster members in spite of the similarity in velocity and metallicity , although there is some discussion in the literature regarding the actual heliocentric velocity of the cluster @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our heliocentric velocities differ from those reported by @xcite based on the same observations for unknown reasons .",
    "our inferred heliocentric velocities from the three different wavelength settings obtained at different times are in excellent agreement with each other ( @xmath10 km s@xmath8 ) , which is not true for @xcite ( see their table 3 ) .",
    "after continuum normalisation , we performed a standard 1d lte abundance analysis using the smh spectrum analysis program of @xcite , which is built around the well - known moog code of @xcite .",
    "initial effective temperature guesses were provided by de - reddened 2mass photometry @xcite using the @xcite calibration . similarly to @xcite we discard the star b-134 from further analysis due to contamination of the spectra from a companion / blending star .",
    "spectroscopic stellar parameters of @xmath11 , @xmath12  and [ fe / h ] were determined from an iterative procedure to achieve excitation and ionisation balance using @xmath1360 fei lines and 12 feii lines .",

    "the solid grey lines represent the 1@xmath27 measurement of the mean of the 8 stars and the dashed lines either side of the line profile show the width of the noise of the combined spectra .",

    "finally , we argue that no reliable sr abundance can be inferred from these individual giraffe spectra .",
