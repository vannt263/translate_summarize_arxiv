    "although our technique was specifically designed to find cluster progenitors in the presence of appreciable errors in photometric redshift , until we have spectroscopic confirmation we will consider the targets ( table 1 ) as ( strong ) candidates of forming clusters .",
    "however , two of our candidates have already been independently confirmed by other surveys , suggesting that our finder is robust . the first candidate , pc07 ( @xmath88 ) , coincides with a structure discovered by @xcite in a deep medium - band photometric survey .",
    "they found a large number of galaxies in three adjacent clumps of 5 comoving mpc ( diameter ) , for which spectroscopic follow - up gave a more precise redshift of 2.09 .",
    "they identified this structure as the progenitor region of a massive cluster .",
    "the second candidate , pc19 ( @xmath89 ) , coincides with a large overdensity of ly@xmath10 emitters ( laes ) discovered as part of the hetdex pilot survey @xcite .",

    "we can also estimate the completeness from figure 1 by calculating the probability for a cluster progenitor to have @xmath35 above the threshold we set ( @xmath77 ) .",

    "we have excluded the possibility that lensing magnification by nearby clusters is responsible for boosting the high redshift number counts .",
    "we note that our analysis of the @xmath1 comoving mpc scale clustering is solely designed for identifying cluster progenitor structures as a whole and does not necessarily imply the presence of any specific environmental impacts on such scales .",
    "however , future studies of the interplay between galaxy properties and environment will benefit from having a large systematic sample of cluster progenitors such as the one presented here .",

    "it is also possible that these dense proto - cluster regions will show up in planned studies that will use background quasars and bright lyman break galaxies to perform lyman-@xmath10 forest tomographic mapping @xcite .",
