    "chladni demonstrated that the pattern thus formed was the nodal pattern of the plate - he experimented with square , circular , hexagonal , rectangular , elliptical , semicircular , and triangular plates . from that time",

    "a lot of progress has been made in recent times , mostly when the plates are separable or fully chaotic as we describe below . in present times ,  chladni experiments \" have turned into studies on billiards wherein a point particle moves freely inside an enclosure , reflecting specularly from the boundaries in accordance with the snell s law .",
    "the quantum problem then involves solving the schrdinger equation for the system with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the eigenfunctions obtained there are then subjected to the study of nodal lines and domains .",
    "the nodal domains of a real wavefunction may be defined as maximally connected regions wherein the function does not change sign .",
    "the sequence of the number of nodal domains of the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation contains significant geometric information about the system @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the distribution of nodal domains can serve to distinguish between systems which are integrable ( with the laplacian being separable ) and non - integrable ( with classically chaotic ray dynamics ) , and the limiting distribution , which always exists for separable domains , can give a new criterion for chaos in quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem of the equilateral triangle billiards presents an example of a non - separable system that is analysed here .",
    "we present our study on this system by making extensive numerical investigations .",
    "analysis through this enormous data leads us to several interesting conjectures ( section 2 ) , connections with the symmetry group and statistical studies on domains ( section 3 ) where some analytical results are also given .",
    "it may be worth pointing out that the number of nodal domains for a separable billiard like a rectangle is quite simple .",
    "this is because the eigenfunctions are products of trigonometric functions ( sine functions ) in @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables .",
    "this results in the total number of domains equalling the product of the quantum numbers .",
    "the complication arises from the fact that the ordering of energy levels ( labelled by the index @xmath2 ) does not follow the number of nodal domains , @xmath3 .",
