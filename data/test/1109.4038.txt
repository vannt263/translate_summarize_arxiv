    "in the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmological model , the current accelerated phase of expansion is driven by a cosmological constant @xmath0 that dominates the present energy density of the universe , whose equation of state ( eos ) parameter is @xmath4 .",
    "the second component in importance is cold dark matter ( dm ) , a non - baryonic dust component that drives the growth of large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "this simple model fits rather well the observational data and requires the minimum set of cosmological parameters @xcite . also , it is the preferred model based on statistical selection criteria @xcite .",
    "the observational successes of the @xmath0cdm cosmology is linked to its capacity to reproduce the right sequence of cosmological eras : matter - radiation equality occurs well before recombination and the matter dominated period lasts long enough to allow the growth of lss .",
    "the length of the radiation and matter periods are crucial to determine the shape of the matter and radiation power spectra .",
    "alternative models must also reproduce the correct sequence of cosmological eras to fit the data @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath0cdm model fits the observational data very well , it appears rather unsatisfactory from the theoretical point of view .",
    "in fact , a cosmological constant is not very appealing .",
    "its measured value is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the expected amplitude at the planck scale @xcite and introduces the so - called coincidence problem ( i.e. ,  why are the densities of dm and dark energy ( de ) of the same order precisely today ? \" ) @xcite .",
    "this is why a plethora of more flexible models that behave akin to the @xmath0cdm at the background level have been introduced over the years -see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "this complicates enormously the task of judiciously deciding which model should be preferred over all the others in view of their observational and theoretical merits .",
    "for instance , the acceleration could be driven by a dark energy component with eos parameter @xmath5 @xcite , constant or variable on cosmological timescales .",
    "the simplest variants require cosmological parameters to be fine tuned at some initial time , suffering also -though , at a lower extent- from the coincidence problem and more complex models have been introduced @xcite . before carrying out a detailed analysis , these alternatives first use probes of the cosmic expansion history such as luminosity distances derived from supernovae type ia data , angular diameter distances from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , the expansion rate , @xmath6 , at various redshifts , etc .",
    "@xcite . data on matter density perturbations and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provide stronger constraints but require to solve the time evolution of the density perturbations in all components . in general ,",
    "the resulting set of equations is far more involved than in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "furthermore , small differences on the dynamics of the dark sector change the equations governing the evolution of matter perturbations @xcite , and no generic constraints can be imposed on large classes of models . as a result",
    ", many models in the literature have not been constrained by the current data on density inhomogeneities and cmb temperature anisotropies -see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how to derive the matter power spectrum of a generic de model without the need of solving in full the perturbation equations for the radiation and matter components .",
    "several observables can be computed in terms of the matter power spectrum alone and can be used to constrain the model beyond the expansion rate .",
    "the observables include : ( a ) the fluctuation of the matter density perturbations on a sphere of @xmath7mpc , @xmath8 @xcite ; ( b ) the rms peculiar velocity of matter on spheres of radius @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite ; ( c ) the weak lensing convergence spectrum @xcite ; ( d ) the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) and integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) components of the cmb temperature anisotropies @xcite ; ( e ) the cross - correlation of the isw with templates of projected density of galaxies @xcite , etc . for example , the sw and isw effects are the dominant contributions to the cmb anisotropies at low multipoles .",
    "if the power spectrum is normalized to the measured value @xmath11 @xcite , the predicted low order multipoles of the cmb , the peculiar velocity on a given scale @xcite or the measured isw - large scale structure cross - correlation @xcite can be compared with observations .",
    "our method provides simple tests of models using a wealth of data beyond luminosity and angular diameter distance measurements .",
    "the idea of how to construct the matter power spectrum is based on the harrison - zeldovich ( hz ) @xcite prescription .",
    "for any two models , the amplitude of density perturbations are specified at horizon crossing instead of at some arbitrary initial hypersurface .",
    "the final spectrum will differ only by the subsequent ( subhorizon ) evolution of each single mode .",
    "if we use as a starting model one that is implemented on publicly available numerical codes like cmbfast @xcite , for example the concordance @xmath0cdm model , we will be able to construct the power spectrum of a generic de model ( not implemented on numerical codes ) .",
    "the method can be used to derive the power spectrum ranging from galaxy to horizon scales , i.e. , at all the scales that can be observed at present .    in developing this method ,",
    "our aim is not to use it to solve models of de with a constant eos parameter . in section [ sec : mps_de ] , we consider a de model with constant eos parameter , @xmath12 ( though being aware that it is observationally discarded ) just to illustrate the accurateness of the method in a model which , on the one hand , it is easy to obtain the exact evolution of the perturbations and , on the other hand , its evolution differs substantially from that of the standard @xmath0cdm . with this",
    "we can see that obtaining the matter power spectrum of a de model from the one of @xmath0cdm is reasonable also in cases when both models differ greatly at the background level .",
    "this method can be useful in solving the perturbation equations of interacting de - dm models @xcite .",
    "many of these models aim to describe the universe at low redshifts , when dm and de dominate the expansion . following our method , the matter perturbations evolve as in the @xmath0cdm model before horizon crossing ( this avoids the need of explicitly introducing initial conditions for the perturbations ) .",
    "moreover , because it suffices to compute the evolution of the perturbations of the particular de model considered after they enter the horizon , the set of equations to be solved gets greatly simplified .",
    "this is shown in section [ sec : mps_de ] .",
    "briefly , section [ sec : hzp ] recalls the basics of the hz prescription . section [ sec : mps_de ] describes how the matter power spectrum of a generic de model can be constructed .",
    "section [ sec : rps ] discusses how to calculate the low multipoles on cmb temperature anisotropies to constrain the model .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the main results of the paper .",
    "in their seminal papers , harrison and zeldovich @xcite computed the present matter power spectrum assuming that all perturbations at horizon crossing have the same amplitude .",
    "then , they computed the matter power spectrum @xmath13 at the present time after accounting for the subhorizon evolution of each mode . to illustrate their argument ,",
    "let us construct the power spectrum of the standard cdm model , a model that only contains dm , baryons and radiation ( subscripts @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively ) , and verifies @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy density of component @xmath19 in units of the critical density .",
    "let us define the density contrast by @xmath20 . in the linear regime , spatial and time dependence",
    "can be separated : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the growing solution and @xmath23 is evaluated at the present time , @xmath24 .",
    "the current power spectrum is then defined as : @xmath25 .    in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "model , @xmath26 const during the radiation dominated era and @xmath27 , during the matter dominated period .",
    "the hz prescription establishes that all mass perturbations , defined as @xmath28 , have the same amplitude at the time @xmath29 when they enter the horizon , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scale factor , @xmath32 the radius of the horizon , and @xmath33 the comoving wavelength of each particular mode ; @xmath34 would be the corresponding wavenumber .",
    "in particular @xmath35 with @xmath36 the moment of matter - radiation equality .",
    "once a perturbation enters the horizon , it will evolve as @xmath22 and we can write @xmath37 the evolution after horizon crossing depends on whether it occurs before or after matter - radiation equality :    1 .    if @xmath38 , then @xmath39 because perturbations are essentially frozen in the radiation era .",
    "consequently , @xmath40 .",
    "2 .    if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 . in the last equality",
    "we have used the relation between the comoving wavenumber and the time of horizon crossing @xmath43 , valid in the matter era . then @xmath44 .    as a consequence of the growth of density perturbations in the matter and radiation epochs , the power spectrum has two asymptotic regimes : @xmath45 at large and small scales , respectively , with a maximum at the scale of matter - radiation equality .",
    "since the transition from the radiation to the matter dominated period is not instantaneous , @xmath13 has a smooth maximum about matter - radiation equality , at @xmath46 .",
    "the power spectrum is conveniently expressed as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a normalization constant and @xmath49 the spectral index at large scales .",
    "the transfer function @xmath50 is determined by the growth rate within the horizon . in the specific case of the hz prediction , @xmath51 .",
    "the spectra of the concordance @xmath0cdm models differ from the spectra of models with no cosmological constant in two main respects , namely : ( 1 ) the scale of matter radiation equality is shifted to larger scales , and ( 2 ) the growth factor of matter density perturbations slows down once the overall expansion accelerates . as mentioned above , in this section",
    "we shall show how to compute the present matter power spectrum of a de model , in principle not implemented on a numerical package , from the power spectrum of a model that is implemented . as an example",
    ", we shall construct the power spectrum of models with @xmath52 from the concordance @xmath0cdm .",
    "the evolution of density perturbations of de models with constant eos is implemented in standard packages like cmbfast and can be computed numerically but they will be useful to estimate the accuracy of the method . for simplicity , all models will share identical cosmological parameters , namely @xmath53 , @xmath54 km / s / mpc and @xmath51 .",
    "the models differ only in the eos parameter , @xmath55 .    following the hz prescription , we assume that all perturbations have the same amplitude at horizon crossing . then , we just need to compare the growth rate of density perturbations in both models once perturbations cross the horizon .",
    "even if the subhorizon evolution of density perturbations is the same in the @xmath0cdm as in the de model , the final power spectrum could be different . in each model ,",
    "fixed comoving wavelengths @xmath33 cross the horizon at different times @xmath29 and the growth rate from @xmath29 to the present time @xmath24 will be different for each of them .",
    "then , we need to determine : ( 1 ) the size of the horizon as a function of time to fix when a perturbation crosses the horizon , and ( 2 ) solve the equations of evolution of subhorizon density perturbations during the radiation , matter and accelerated expansion epochs . if dm and de density perturbations evolve independently during the radiation regime , we can expect the evolution of dm perturbations to be independent of the model . specifically , in the radiation era the expansion timescale is @xmath56 while if the free - fall time of matter within a density perturbation is @xmath57 , much smaller than the expansion timescale and matter perturbations will not grow significantly during the radiation regime . with this simplifying assumption , if the de model and @xmath0cdm have the same matter - radiation equality and perturbations cross the horizon at the same time , then the power spectrum at small scales will have the same shape in both models . without restricting the applicability of our method ,",
    "this assumption guarantees that the de model will pass the constraints imposed by the galaxy distribution on scales @xmath58mpc@xmath59 not less well than the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "our method is more easily implemented when the equations of evolution of subhorizon sized perturbations after matter - radiation equality form a closed system and can be solved independently for each energy density component ( see @xcite for extensive reviews on cosmological perturbation theory ) . if both models have identical evolution during the radiation era , once the universe becomes matter dominated the anisotropic stress due to neutrinos will be negligible and , in the newtonian gauge , it will suffice just one single gravitational potential , say @xmath60 , to determine the flat metric element @xmath61 from the ( 0,0 ) component of einstein s equations , the evolution of the gravitational potential is given by @xmath62 where the sum extends over all matter components .",
    "if the energy components interact only gravitationally between themselves , then the energy - momentum tensors are individually conserved . for a generic component @xmath48 , by perturbing the conservation equation @xmath63 one obtains @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the sound speed ,",

    "this amplitude will depend on the model , but for the same wavelength the ratio of amplitudes of different models will be constant , independent of scale , and this factor could be absorbed into the normalization .",
    "but even if the amplitudes at horizon crossing were the same , the current amplitudes will differ because of their different growth rates .",
    "when a perturbation of a fixed scale @xmath77 enters the horizon at time @xmath78 and @xmath79 it grows by a factor @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the final amplitudes will differ by a factor @xmath82 as a result , @xmath83 this identity holds even if the spectral index differs from unity , @xmath84 .",
    "to derive @xmath85 for each cosmological model we first compute the horizon radius , @xmath86 , to determine when a mode enters the horizon , and then solve the dynamical equations to find the subhorizon growth factor @xmath87 after matter - radiation equality .",

    "if both power spectra are normalized at the same amplitude at small scales , then @xmath90 and de and @xmath0cdm spectra will coincide at small scales .",

    "<S> according to the harrison - zeldovich prescription , the amplitude of matter density perturbations at horizon crossing is the same at all scales . based on this prescription , we show how to construct the matter power spectrum of generic dark energy models from the power spectrum of a @xmath0cdm model without the need of solving in full the dynamical equations describing the evolution of all energy density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows to make model predictions of observables that can be expressed in terms of the matter power spectrum alone , such as the amplitude of matter fluctuations , peculiar velocities , cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies on large angular scales or the weak lensing convergence spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> then , models that have been tested only at the background level using the rate of the expansion of the universe can now be tested using data on gravitational clustering and on large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> this method can save a lot of effort in checking the validity of dark energy models . as an example of the accurateness of the approximation used , </S>",
    "<S> we compute the power spectrum of different dark energy models with constant equation of state parameter ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , ruled out by observations but easy to compare to numerical solutions ) using our methodology and discuss the constraints imposed by the low multipoles of the cosmic microwave background . </S>"
