    "experiments at rhic and lhc indicate that the quark - gluon plasma is an almost perfect fluid where viscous effects are small @xcite . in contrast , at low temperatures and nonzero baryon chemical potentials in the hadron gas phase , viscous effects may be considerably more pronounced @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of the hydrodynamical evolution of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) show that viscosity produces some visible but not very large effects on global observables @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate how the presence of a nonzero shear viscosity relaxation time affects wave propagation in relativistic fluids .",
    "waves in a hadronic medium may be caused , for example , by fluctuations in baryon number or energy density .",
    "these fluctuations may be produced by inhomogeneous initial conditions which , as pointed out in @xcite , are the result of quantum fluctuations in the densities of the two colliding nuclei and also in the energy deposition mechanism . these fluctuations and their phenomenological implications have been studied extensively @xcite because they may be responsible for the angular correlations of particle emission observed in heavy - ion experiments .",
    "there are also hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite , which are the result of finite particle number effects in a given fluid cell .",
    "this generates local thermal fluctuations of the energy density ( and flow velocity ) which propagate throughout the fluid .",
    "furthermore , there may be fluctuations induced by energetic partons , which have been scattered in the initial collision of the two nuclei and propagate through the medium , losing energy and acting as a source term for the hydrodynamical equations @xcite . finally , there may be also freeze - out fluctuations , which may be caused by finite particle number effects during and after the freeze - out of the hydrodynamically expanding fluid .    in non - relativistic fluid dynamics",
    "the most successful theory of dissipative systems is the navier - stokes ( ns ) theory @xcite .",
    "for instance , one can use this theory to investigate the evolution of density perturbations in a non - relativistic hadron gas and in a non - relativistic quark gluon plasma .",
    "perturbations are usually studied with the linearization formalism @xcite , which is the simplest way to study small deviations from equilibrium to obtain wave equations , eventually featuring dissipative and relaxation terms .",
    "the propagation of perturbations through a qgp has been investigated in several works with the help of a linearized version of the hydrodynamics of perfect fluids and of viscous fluids . in @xcite",
    "the authors went beyond linearization and considered the effects of shear viscosity on the propagation of nonlinear waves .",
    "this study was performed with the help of the well established reductive perturbation method @xcite .",
    "the simplest extension of the well - known navier - stokes equations to relativistic fluids is plagued with instabilities and acausal signal propagation in the resulting equations @xcite , and , thus , they are not usually employed in numerical simulations .",
    "currently , most fluid - dynamical simulations of the qgp employ a set of relaxation - type equations similar to those derived by israel and stewart ( is ) @xcite to close the conservation laws .    in this work we study",
    "the propagation of linear and nonlinear waves in relativistic fluids described by ( a simplified set of ) of the 2nd order conformal is equations .",
    "we show how to obtain the linear wave equation which contains the dissipative and relaxation terms .",
    "this wave equation provides a dispersion relation that allows for the study of the stability and causality properties of the theory .",
    "we then expand the modes of the dispersion relation in powers of the wavenumber to investigate the effects of a nonzero relaxation time coefficient . understanding the relaxation effects in the linear modes proved to be a useful guide to approach the same question in the case of nonlinear perturbations .",
    "solutions of nonlinear equations of motion generally contain nonlinear dispersive and dissipative terms .",
    "the relative strength of these different terms depends on microscopic properties of the system , which manifest themselves in the transport coefficients ( such as the shear viscosity coefficient , @xmath0 , and the relaxation time , @xmath1 ) and in the equation of state .",
    "different combinations of these terms generate korteweg - de vries solitons , shock waves , strongly damped waves and so on . in principle , given the underlying microscopic theory , one can calculate the transport coefficients and the equation of state to determine the type of waves which can propagate in the system . however , when the underlying theory is qcd this is not an easy task due to the strongly coupled nature of the quark - gluon plasma and one needs to resort to phenomenological models to estimate @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the qcd equation of state can be reliably computed on the lattice @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of these quantities defines the properties of the solutions of the wave equations .",
    "inconsistent choices may lead to unphysical solutions and this opens the possibility of using waves to put some additional constraints on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the qgp .    in this paper",
    "we show how to obtain a system of two coupled differential equations to study nonlinear waves in conformal is theory .",
    "we solve this system numerically , determining the role played by shear viscosity and its relaxation time on wave packet evolution .",
    "one of the equations of this system is the burgers equation for the first order perturbation in the energy density , which does not contain relaxation effects , and it is , thus , the same equation obtained in the ns - based approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the other equation describes the second order perturbation in the energy density , where the effects from a nonzero relaxation time coefficient become manifest .",
    "our results indicate the presence of a `` soliton - like '' , i.e. , an approximately solitary wave solution , in is theory despite the dissipative and relaxation effects .",
    "another motivation to study nonlinear perturbations is the possibility to find an upper bound for the relaxation scale , which is not found in the linear treatment .",

    "our semi - analytical treatment provides a simple ( yet nontrivial ) picture of how the relaxation time coefficient affects the propagation of sound waves perhaps in a more transparent way than in a complex numerical hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "our system of differential equations can be easily solved numerically and in certain conditions gives `` soliton - like '' behavior for the initial wave packet evolution .",
    "our work may be relevant for the understanding of nonlinear perturbations in viscous relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "for instance , our study of the deep `` israel - stewart limit '' where @xmath139 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and @xmath155 in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] suggest the existence of an upper bound for @xmath81 ( for a given @xmath83 ) , which marks the onset of a possible instability in the solutions in this case that involves moderately large initial spatial gradients .",
    "while the linearized study of wave propagation shows that @xmath156 can not be much smaller than @xmath157 ( due to instabilities ) , our nonlinear treatment of the wave equation for the energy density in hydrodynamics indicates that in a consistent microscopic theory @xmath156 and @xmath157 must be of comparable magnitude ( this is valid , for instance , in the case of kinetic theory calculations ) .",
    "however , we remark that in the  rigorous \" hydrodynamical limit of small spatial gradients , when considering initial gaussian profiles with large widths , it is possible to avoid instabilities in wave propagation , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , while still maintaining the soliton - like solution .",
    "therefore , our nonlinear study suggests that in the case of small spatial gradients , israel - stewart theory should support soliton - like wave phenomena .",
    "for most of our investigations we found that the influence of @xmath156 did not determine the overall behavior of wave propagation in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this conclusion agrees with previous investigations in the literature on the small effect of second order transport coefficients in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "our only exceptions were the ones that implied unphysical values of relaxation time and large initial spatial gradients .",
    "this statement suggests that in physical systems under conditions that are consistent with the hydrodynamic behavior ( small gradients ) , @xmath158 should be of order 1 and the effect of the relaxation time on nonlinear wave propagation can be taken to be a small correction .",
    "the differential equations ( [ burgxtcad ] ) and ( [ weeps2onlyad ] ) are nontrivial alternative approaches to investigate the nonlinear regime of wave propagation in 2nd order conformal hydrodynamics in the israel - stewart approximation .",
    "however , they are still simple enough to be investigated with simple numerical routines . for this particular type of study ,",
    "these equations offer a simple ( though clearly limited ) alternative to the full numerical hydrodynamical equations .",
    "we hope that our work can be used both as a motivation for the search for soliton waves in the full israel - stewart equations as well as a possible check of precision of numerical hydrodynamic codes , similar to the analytical solutions found in @xcite",
    ".    it would be interesting to generalize the analysis performed here to include effects from bulk viscosity ( i.e. , by dropping the underlying conformal invariance of the equations ) and different equations of state .",
    "moreover , even though the nonlinear terms in 2nd order hydrodynamics do not contribute to the linearized study , they may play an interesting role in the investigation of nonlinear wave propagation in the qgp but we leave this investigation to a future study .",
    "this work was partially financed by the brazilian funding agencies capes , cnpq and fapesp .",
    "j.  n.  thanks the physics department of the ohio state university for its hospitality during the time this work was being finished .",
    "here we focus on the detailed calculations involved in section @xmath159 , subsection @xmath160 .",
    "the rpm method described in section @xmath159 , subsection @xmath161 is used in the simplest conformal relativistic israel - stewart hydrodynamics equations ( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) .      notice",
    "that even though the rpm perturbative scheme does take into consideration nonlinearities , we can the general form of the flow , @xmath164 , to write all the possible contributions of the shear tensor components .",
    "since it is traceless , the diagonal components are related as @xmath165 using the conservation of energy , the term that contains the dissipative tensor in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) can be written as a function of the @xmath166 coordinate ( using the previous relations ) @xmath167 the same can be done for the dissipative contribution in the momentum equation eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) : @xmath168 now , for more general flow patterns the relaxation equation eq .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) will couple the different components of the dissipative tensor .",
    "however , in our particular case regarding this @xmath169 flow pattern , different components do not couple and the relevant term simply becomes @xmath170 therefore , our analysis is consistent ( and simple ) and does not require any further approximation regarding the mixing of different shear stress tensor components .",
