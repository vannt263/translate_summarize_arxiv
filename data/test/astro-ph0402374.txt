    "the currently best - studied theories of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows ( ags ) are the _ fireball _ models ( see , e.g. , zhang & meszaros 2003 for a recent review ) and the _ cannonball _ ( cb ) model ( see , e.g. , dar & de rjula 2003a ; dado , dar & de rjula , 2002a ; 2003a and references therein ) .",
    "the first set of models is often considered to be _ the standard model _ of grbs . in spite of their similarly - sounding names , these two models are ( or were initially ) completely different in their basic hypothesis , in their description of the data , and in their predictions . in this note",
    "we concentrate on a cb - model prediction which is not ( to date ) a standard - model one , the apparently superluminal motion of the source of grbs and their afterglows : the  cannonballs \" . in quite exceptional cases",
    "relatively close - by grbs with sufficiently bright ( radio ) ags it may be possible to observe this superluminal motion of cbs relative to `` fixed stars '' .",
    "prior to grb 030329 , the case in which a possible superluminal motion ( dar & de rjula 2000 ) came closest to being observable was that of grb 980425 , which could `` almost '' be classified ( dar & de rjula 2003a ) as an x - ray flash ( xrf ) .",
    "for xrfs , the observation of a superluminal motion may be simpler than for grbs , for the source s apparent displacement in the sky is proportional to the ( small ) observer s viewing angle , and we interpret xrfs as jetted grbs viewed at larger angles ( dar & de rjula 2003a ; dado , dar & de rjula 2003f ) . in a different model ,",
    "this interpretation of xrfs has also been advocated by yamazaki , yonetoku & nakamura ( 2003 ) .",
    "the cb - model is a very explicit elaboration of the original proposal by shaviv and dar ( 1995 ) : that the @xmath0-rays of a grb would be generated by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of stellar light by the electron constituents of transient narrow jets , emitted in stellar processes leading to gravitational collapse .    in the cb model , long - duration grbs , as well as xrfs ( dar & de rjula 2003a ;",
    "dado , dar & de rjula 2003f ) are produced in the explosions of _ ordinary _ core - collapse sne , akin to sn1998bw ( dar & de rjula 2000 ) , the first sn to be observed in `` association '' with a grb ( grb 980425 , galama et al .",
    "two opposite jets of cbs are emitted in the process , travelling with initially large lorentz factors : @xmath1 .",
    "the cbs initially expand ( in their rest system ) at a velocity comparable to , or smaller than , the speed of sound in a relativistic plasma ( @xmath2 ) , so that the jet opening angle ( subtended by a cb s radius as observed from its emission point ) is @xmath3 .",
    "the cbs highly relativistic motion collimates their emitted radiation the grb and its ag within a forward beam of characteristic opening angle @xmath4 .",
    "an observer sees the `` doppler - favoured '' jet , travelling at a small angle @xmath5 relative to the line of sight .",
    "typically @xmath6 , so that the jet s opening angle can be neglected and the observer s angle is the _ only _ relevant one .    in the cb model , during the ag , the jet opening angle _ diminishes _ with time , while the beaming angle @xmath7 increases , both evolutions being due to the cb s interaction with the matter of the interstellar medium ( dado , dar & de rjula , 2002a ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the ag s source becomes increasingly `` pointlike '' , and its motion in the sky can in principle be followed . since a cb s motion is relativistic for days or months of ( observer s ) time ,",
    "its apparent displacement in the sky is _ superluminal _ ( courdec 1939 , rees 1967 ) , as we argued in dar & de rjula ( 2000 ) .",
    "the closest - by grb observed so far grb 980425 , at a redshift @xmath8 came very close to having an observable superluminal motion ( see dado , dar & de rjula 2003a for a detailed discussion ) . in a gcn note ( dar & de rjula 2003b )",
    "we argued that this motion may be observable in the next - closest grb ( 030329 , at @xmath9 ) . in this note",
    "we sharpen the predictions for this putative motion , given the current availability of precise optical data at early times and times later than the first @xmath10 days ( lipkin et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) , as well as sparse x - ray data ( marshall & swank 2003 ; marshall , markwardt & swank 2003 ; tiengo et al .",
    "2003 ) and abundant radio data ( sheth et al .  2003 ; berger et al .  2003 ; pooley 2003 ; kuno et al .",
    "2004 ) .    a very relevant new information ( lipkin et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) on the ag of grb 030329 is the abundance of multiple deviations of the optical light curves relative to a smoothly declining behaviour .",
    "we shall refer to these deviations as _ features_. in dado et al .",
    "( 2003c ) we attributed the most obvious optical - ag feature a  shoulder \" starting at @xmath11 1 day ( after burst) to a transition between a first to a second dominant cb , a choice supported by the fact that the @xmath0-ray light - curve of this grb has a very clear two - pulse structure ( vanderspek et al .",
    "2003 ; http:// space.mit.edu/ hete/ bursts/ grb030329/ ; see also vanderspeck et al .  2004 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ grb ] ) . with the emergence of a handful of other similarly - significant features in the first week fast ups and downs of the optical fluences , @xmath12 , by some 20 to 40% a more elaborate interpretation is required . in the ag model",
    "@xmath12 is a direct and _ quasi - local _ tracer of the density of the ism through which a cb travels , a fact to which we have attributed previous similar observations , e.g.  the  humps \" in the optical ags of grbs 000301c and 970508 ( dado et al .",
    "it is therefore necessary to investigate the effect of local ism density - inhomogeneities on the expected superluminal motion .",
    "this is what we do in this note for the case of grb 030329 .",
    "we conclude that the sources motion results in a displacement of @xmath13 ( 0.6 ) mas from day 3 to day 30 ( 100 ) after burst . detecting such a motion may not be out of the question .    for the benefit of readers not familiar with the cb model , we present in an appendix a brief overview of the model and its current confrontation with data .",
    "we also offer there some commentary on the evolution of the standard model .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath14 of a cb diminishes with the distance @xmath15 from the parent sn , as its motion is decelerated by collisions with the constituents of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in an approximately hydrogenic ism of local number density @xmath16 , the evolution of @xmath17 is determined by energy - momentum conservation to be : @xmath18 with @xmath19 the cb s baryon number and @xmath20 its calculable asymptotic radius , reached within minutes of observer s time . for typical parameters , by the time @xmath21 , the function @xmath17 is still extremely well approximated by its initial value @xmath22 ( dado et al .",
    "2002a ) .    for an object travelling at nearly the speed of light the relation between @xmath23 and the element of observer s time , @xmath24 ,",
    "is : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cosmological redshift and @xmath27 is the doppler factor by which the energy of photons emitted by the cb is locally boosted by its relativistic motion . for the lorentz factors and viewing angles relevant to our discussion , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 to an excellent approximation .",
    "we may integrate eqs .",

    "for some simple density profiles the above formal exercise can be carried explicitly to the end . for a constant - density ism ,",
    "for instance , we may define : @xmath36 and conclude that @xmath35 is the real root of the cubic : @xmath37= { 2\\,c\\ , t\\over 3\\ , ( 1+z)\\ , x_\\infty}\\ ; , \\label{cubic0}\\ ] ] that is : @xmath38\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\   c&\\equiv & \\left[{2/ \\left(b^2 + 2\\,\\theta^6+b\\,\\sqrt{b^2 + 4\\,\\theta^6}\\right)}\\right]^{1/3}\\ , ,",

    "the distance @xmath41 is reached , the ag fluence , proportional to a high power of @xmath35 , has decreased by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "we have performed cb - model fits to the ag measurements of all the grbs of known redshift , and found that the values of @xmath41 are spread over more than an order of magnitude , centering at @xmath42 pc ( dado et al 2002a ) .",
    "these are comparable to the radii of the _ superbubbles _ wherein most sn explosions take place , created by the stellar winds and explosions of many previous sne in dense star - formation regions .",
    "the approximation of a constant density @xmath43 , employed in the quoted fits , may be a fair first try for the density within the superbubble and in the galactic - halo regions close - to but without the superbubble . in the case of grb 030329",
    "we shall see that the density profile of the superbubble s surface , as traced by the cb s x - ray and optical fluences , is quite rich and interesting .",
    "the transverse projected velocity in the sky of a cb relative to its parent sn can be obtained from eq .",

    "( [ latealpha ] ) implies that the superluminal motion in the former systems is relatively easier to observe .",
    "moreover , the larger the value of @xmath56 , the smaller the values of @xmath57 favoured by selection effects ( detection thresholds ) .",
    "this also privileges xrfs over grbs as potential targets for a search of a superluminal cb motion .",
    "in the cb model , the ags of grbs and xrfs consist of three contributions , from the cbs themselves , the concomitant sn , and the host galaxy : @xmath58 the latter contribution is usually determined by late - time observations , when the cb and sn contributions become negligible , or from measurements with sufficient angular resolution to tell apart @xmath59 from @xmath60 .    let the unattenuated energy flux density of sn1998bw at redshift @xmath61 ( galama et al .",

    "the `` late '' index is independent of the attenuation in the host galaxy , since at @xmath81 ( observer s ) days after the explosion , the cbs are typically already moving in the low - column - density , optically - transparent halo of the host galaxy .",

    "et al .  ( 2002a ) we showed that , in the cb model , the ags of the grbs of known redshift measured at the time could be successfully explained by a single dominant cb launched in the explosion of a sn akin to sn1998bw and moving , after a couple of observer hours , in an approximately constant - density ism .",

    ", there were three cases ( grbs 970508 , 000301c and 021004 ) for which the data showed clear evidence for deviations from a smooth ag behaviour . in the case of grb 000301c , we attributed the `` residua '' of the observational data relative to its smooth cb - model fit to moderate deviations of the ism density ( far from the parent sn ) from a constant value . in the case of grb 970508 , we have actually fit the ag to a jump from one to another constant - density value ( dado et al .",
    "2002a ) . for grb 021004",
    "we found it more natural to fit the ag to the contribution of two cbs , since in this case the @xmath0-ray count - rate as a function of time has a very clear two - pulse ( i.e.  two - cb ) structure ( dado et al .",
    "2003d ) . moreover , unlike for grb 970508 , our attempts to describe the ag of grb 021004 in terms of density variations failed , while the two - cb description fits the general trend of the ag very well .",

    "in its current form , the theory of ags in the cb model is based on an analogy with high - resolution observations of relativistic jets emitted by systems such as the microquasars ss 433 ( http://chandra.harvard.edu/ photo/2002/ 0214/ index.html ; http:// chandra .",

    "the cb - model s simple explanation for this surprising fact is the following ( dado et al .",
    "the ambient protons intercepted by a cb in its voyage encounter its inner chaotic magnetic field and are reemitted roughly isotropically ( in the cb s rest system ) .",
    "this implies an inwards pressure that stops the cb s expansion and that is asymptotically equal to the pressure of the cb s inner magnetic field , which is thereby calculable .",
    "the corresponding deceleration law ( at constant radius @xmath20 and ism density @xmath43 ) is that of eq .",
    "( [ cubic0 ] ) .",
    "the magnitude and time - dependence of the magnetic field determined as in the previous paragraph plays a crucial role in the prediction of the broad - band ag spectra , which in the cb model is extremely simple , parameter - thrifty , and successful ( dado et al .",
    "2003a , 2003e ) , particularly in comparison with its standard counterpart ( see , e.g.  granot & sari 2002 ) . in spite of their phenomenological success , our assumptions leading to calculable cb radii and magnetic fields are very bold , and are no doubt oversimplifications . to investigate their solidity , in dado et al .",
    "( 2002a ) we also studied a different ansatz : that the cb s radius @xmath118 would keep on increasing constantly with @xmath23 , with the ism density still kept approximately constant .",
    "this ansatz , which corresponds to a much faster cb deceleration than that of eq .",
    "( [ cubic0 ] ) , failed miserably .",
    "but in between the two extremes ( a non - increasing and a steadily increasing cb s radius ) , it is clear that there should be choices of @xmath119 and @xmath16 that are phenomenologically satisfactory and yet , correspond to a _",

    "the late shells bring in an energy injection an order of magnitude larger than that of the original blast wave",

    "no new phenomena must be invoked and no grb parameters must be fine - tuned with special care .",
    "the data on grb 030329 are now sufficiently complete to allow for a detailed prediction of the motion of the source of its ag allegedly superluminal in the cb model .",
    "the @xmath0-ray light - curve and the optical ag require the presence of two cbs , one of which dominates the ag at late times .",
    "the parameters needed to predict the motion of the two cbs in the sky are determined by the optical data , so that the individual motion of each cb is predicted .",
    "the main result of this paper is the prediction of the sky - motion of the fastest - moving cb , which dominates the late ag , and is shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "but we are encouraged by the fact that in the only case in which the superluminal jets of cbs made by a core - collapse sn could be seen , they were seen .",
    "indeed , observations of sn 1987a ( ninenson and papaliolios , 1999 ) showed two sources , moving in opposite directions along the sn s axis at ( real ) velocities compatible with the speed of light and at an apparent superluminal velocity for the approaching source . mercifully , the jet of that sn was not pointing in our direction ( dar , laor & shaviv 1998 ; dar & de rjula 2001b ) .    regarding the search for a superluminal motion , we learned by reading the e - version of nyt 030529 ( the new york times of that date , in grb s parlance ) that , according to dale frail _  [ our observations ] are sufficient to rule out predictions of the cannonball model\"_. we have shown that , indeed , the observations of complicated features in the optical ag of grb 030329 imply that our earlier results ( dar & de rjula 2003b ) which ignored the presence of these features constituted an overestimate of the predicted superluminal displacement . in this sense ,",

    "the grb appeared to be underluminous because it was viewed further off axis than others ( e.g. , dar and de rjula 2000 ) .",

    "the a - posteriori analysis of dado et al .",
    "( 2002a ) of all the available data supported the conclusion that _ all _ ( long ) grbs are indeed associated with such sne .",
    "in several more recent cases we used the cb model to _ predict _ how the associated sn would compare with the rest of the ag ( grb 011121 , 020405 , 021211 ; dado et al .  2002b , 2002c , 2003d ) .",
    "the most interesting case is that of grb 030329/sn2003dh , for which we also foretold the date when the sn would be dominant enough to be discovered ( dado et al .",

    "the @xmath0-ray polarization is nearly maximal .",
    "a long list of phenomenologically - observed correlations between many different grb observables appear to be well satisfied . _",
    "all _ of these properties are very simply and successfully explained by the cb model , in a manner that does not require the introduction of _ any _ ad - hoc parameters ( dar & de rjula 2003a and references therein ) .      in the ag phase , and within a few observer minutes from the end of a grb s intense @xmath0 emission , the emissivity of a cb is dominated by synchrotron emission from the electrons that penetrate in it as it propagates in the ism . integrated over frequency ,",
    "this synchrotron emissivity is proportional to the energy - deposition rate of the ism electrons in the cb .",
    "these electrons are  fermi - accelerated \" in the cb s tangled magnetic maze to a broken power - law energy distribution with a `` bend '' energy equal to their incident energy in the cbs rest frame , @xmath127 .",

    "the approximate cb - model analysis of the fluences of grb ags , as functions of time and frequency , is fairly simple . besides @xmath26 and @xmath56 ( which are not parameters specific to the model ) it involves only three quantities : @xmath128 , @xmath99 , an overall normalization , and @xmath76 ( a _ single _ free - parameter frequency pertinent to the radio - absorption within a cb ) . in spite of its economy of parameters ( notorious in the case of the wide - band spectral shapes )",

    "<S> the source of the very bright gamma - ray burst grb 030329 is close enough to us for there to be a hope to measure or significantly constrain its putative superluminal motion . </S>",

    "<S> recent precise data on the optical and radio afterglow of this grb which demonstrated its very complex structure allow us to pin down the cb - model s prediction for the afterglow - source position as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> it has been stated that ( the unpublished part of ) the new radio data `` unequivocably disprove '' the cb model . </S>",
