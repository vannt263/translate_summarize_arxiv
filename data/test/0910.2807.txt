    "mixing of species ( e.g. contaminants , tracers and particles ) and thermodynamical quantities ( e.g. temperature ) are dramatically influenced by fluid flows @xcite .",

    "+ the difficulties of the problem come from the intricate nature of the underlying fluid flow , which involves many active nonlinearly coupled degrees of freedom @xcite , and on the poor comprehension of the way through which the fluid is coupled to the transported quantities .",
    "the problem is even more difficult when the transported quantity reacts back to the flow field thus affecting its dynamics .",
    "an instance is provided by the heat transport in convection @xcite .",
    "+ mixing emerges as a final stage of successive hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite eventually leading to a fully developed turbulent stage .",
    "the possibility of controlling such instability mechanisms thus allows one to have a direct control on the mixing process . in some cases the challenge is to enhance the mixing process by stimulating the turbulence transition , in yet other cases the goal is to suppress deleterious instabilities and the ensuing turbulence .",
    "inertial confinement fusion @xcite is an example whose success relies on the control of the famous rayleigh  taylor ( rt ) instability occurring when a heavy , denser , fluid is accelerated into a lighter one . for a fluid in a gravitational field ,",
    "such instability was first described lord rayleigh in the 1880s @xcite and later generalized to all accelerated fluids by sir geoffrey taylor in 1950 @xcite .",
    "our attention here is focused on rt instability with the aim of enhancing the perturbation growth - rate in its early stage of evolution .",
    "the idea is to inject polymers into the fluid and to study on both analytical and numerical ground how the stability of the resulting viscoelastic fluid is modified .",
    "similar problems were already investigated in more specific context , including rt instability of viscoelastic fluids with suspended particles in porous medium with a magnetic field @xcite and rt linear stability analysis of viscoelastic drops in high - speed airstream @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the viscoelasticity is known to affect also other kind of instabilities , including saffman ",
    "taylor instability @xcite , faraday waves @xcite , the stability of kolmogorov flow @xcite , taylor  couette flow @xcite , and rayleigh  bnard problem @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the basic equations ruling the viscoelastic immiscible rt system are introduced together with the phase - field approach . in sec .",
    "3 the linear analysis is presented and the analytical results shown and discussed in sec .  4 . the resulting scenario is corroborated in sec .  5 by means of direct numerical simulations of the original field equations .",
    "the system we consider is composed of two incompressible fluids ( labeled by 1 and 2 ) having different densities , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and different dynamical viscosities , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the denser fluid placed above the less dense one . for more generality ,",
    "the two fluids are supposed to be immiscible so that the surface tension on the interface separating the two fluids will be explicitly taken into account .",
    "the effects of polymer additives is here studied within the framework of the oldroyd - b model @xcite . in this model polymers",
    "are treated as elastic dumbbells , i.e. identical pairs of microscopic beads connected by harmonic springs .",
    "their concentration is supposed to be low enough to neglect polymer - polymer interactions .",
    "the polymer solution is then regarded as a continuous medium , in which the reaction of polymers on the flow is described as an elastic contribution to the total stress tensor of the fluid ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to describe the mixing process of the resulting viscoelastic immiscible fluids we follow the phase - field approach ( for a general description of the method see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and for application to multiphase flows see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . here ,",
    "we only recall that the basic idea of the method is to treat the interface between two immiscible fluids as a thin mixing layer across which physical properties vary steeply but continuously . the evolution of the mixing layer is ruled by an order parameter ( the phase field ) that obeys a cahn  hilliard equation @xcite .",
    "one of the advantage of the method is that the boundary conditions at the fluids interface need not to be specified being encoded in the governing equations . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the method permits to avoid a direct tracking of the interface and easily produces the correct interfacial tension from the mixing - layer free energy .",

    "therefore , in order to quantify the effects of elasticity on rt instability , the growth rate for viscoelastic cases at finite @xmath104 has to be compared with the newtonian case with renormalized viscosity @xmath105 .",
    "another interesting limit is @xmath106 . in this case from ( [ eq30 ] ) one easily obtains that the growth rate coincides with that of the pure solvent ( [ eq28 ] ) , i.e. @xmath107 . the physical interpretation is that in the limit @xmath106 and at finite time for which polymer elongation is finite , the last term in ( [ eq1 ] ) vanishes and one recovers the newtonian case without polymers ( i.e. @xmath93 ) . of course",
    ", this does not mean that in general polymer effects for high elasticity disappear . indeed in the long - time limit",
    "polymer elongation is able to compensate the @xmath108 coefficient and in the late , non - linear stages , one expects to observe strong polymer effects at high elasticity .    from equation ( [ eq30 ] ) one",
    "can easily show ( using implicit differentiation ) that @xmath109 is a monotonic function and , because @xmath110 , we have that instability rate grows with the elasticity , or the deborah number , here defined as @xmath111 .",
    "the case of stable stratification , @xmath112 , is obtained by @xmath113 neglecting surface tension . in this case",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) has no solution for positive @xmath99 , therefore polymers alone can not induce instabilities in a stably stratified fluid .",
    "the analytical results obtained in the previous sections are not exact as they are based on a closure obtained from the potential flow approximation . while this approximation is consistent for the inviscid limit @xmath114 ( where it gives the correct result ( [ eq29 ] ) for a newtonian fluid ) for finite viscosity we have shown that it gives a known upper bound to the actual growth rate of the perturbation @xcite ( this is because the potential flow approximation underestimates the role of viscosity which reduces the instability ) .",
    "nonetheless , in the case of newtonian fluid this upper bound is known to be a good approximation of the actual value of the growth rate measured in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "because both @xmath101 and @xmath106 limits correspond to newtonian fluids , we expect that also in the viscoelastic case the potential flow description is a good approximation .    to investigate this important point , we have performed a set of numerical simulations of the full model ( [ eq1]-[eq3 ] ) in the limit of constant viscosity and relaxation time ( i.e. @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) in two dimensions by means of a standard , fully dealiased , pseudospectral method on a square doubly periodic domain .",

    "more details on the numerical simulation method can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic state corresponds to a zero velocity field , a hyperbolic - tangent profile for the phase field and an uniform distribution of polymers in equilibrium , according to ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the interface of the basic state is perturbed with a sinusoidal wave at wavenumber @xmath119 ( corresponding to maximal instability for the linear analysis ) of amplitude @xmath120 much smaller than the wavelength ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the growth rate @xmath99 of the perturbation is measured directly by fitting the height of the perturbed interface at different times with an exponential law . for given values of @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath21 ,",
    "this procedure is repeated for different values of @xmath104 at the maximal instability wavenumber @xmath119 ( which , for the range of parameters considered here , is always @xmath125 , i.e. it is not affected by elasticity ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the results for two sets of runs at different values of @xmath21 and @xmath124 .",
    "as discussed above , we find that the theoretical prediction given by ( [ eq30 ] ) is indeed an upper bound for the actual growth rate of the perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , the bound gives grow rates which are quite close to the numerical estimated values ( the error is of the order of @xmath126 ) .",
    "the error is smaller for the runs having a larger value of @xmath21 and @xmath124 , as was already discussed by @xcite .",

    "both theoretical and numerical results show that the effect of polymers is to increase the perturbation growth - rate .",
    "@xmath99 grows with the elasticity and saturates for sufficiently large value of @xmath135 .",
    "we investigated the role of polymers on the linear phase of the rayleigh  taylor instability in an oldroyd - b viscoelastic model . in the limit of vanishing deborah number ( i.e. vanishing polymer relaxation time )",
    "we recover a known upper bound for the growth rate of the perturbation in a viscous newtonian fluid with modified viscosity . for finite elasticity",
    ", the growth rate is found to increase monotonically with the deborah number reaching the solvent limit for high deborah numbers .",
    "our findings are corroborated by a set of direct numerical simulations on the viscoelastic boussinesq oldroyd - b model .",
    "our analysis has been confined to the linear phase of the perturbation evolution .",
    "when the perturbation amplitude becomes sufficiently large , nonlinear effects enter into play and a fully developed turbulent regime rapidly sets in @xcite . in the turbulent stage",
    "we expect more dramatic effects of polymers . in turbulent flows ,",
    "a spectacular consequence of viscoelasticity induced by polymers is the drag reduction effect : addition of minute amounts ( a few tenths of p.p.m . in weight ) of long - chain soluble polymers to water leads to a strong reduction ( up to @xmath136 ) of the power necessary to maintain a given throughput in a channel ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conjecture that a similar phenomenon might arise also in the present context .",
    "heuristically , the rt system can indeed be assimilated to a channel inside which vertical motion of thermal plumes is maintained by the available potential energy .",
    "this analogy suggests the possibility to observe in the viscoelastic rt system a `` drag '' reduction ( or mixing enhancement ) phenomenon , i.e. an increase of the velocity of thermal plumes with respect to the newtonian case .",
    "whether or not this picture does apply to the fully developed turbulence regime is left for future research ."
