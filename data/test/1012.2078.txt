    "for more than a century , there has been serious effort invested in compiling a complete survey of stars near the sun .",
    "recent work of note includes lpine s superblink program that has detected dwarfs , giants , and subgiants in the northern sky with spectroscopic distances @xmath9 25.0 pc ( lpine 2005b ) and additional objects in the south , but without spectral types or distance estimates ( lpine 2005a ; lpine 2008 ) .",
    "reid and collaborators have also made progress in this area , focusing on objects within 20 pc using spectrophotometry , as reported in the meeting the cool neighbors papers ( reid et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "these efforts include both previously known and new members of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the survey most similar to our survey discussed here is that of deacon who used supercosmos @xmath10 plates and 2mass to reveal new nearby red objects in the southern sky ( deacon et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "this paper focuses specifically on new discoveries from our supercosmos recons ( scr ) effort ( hambly et al .",
    "2004 , henry et al .",

    "2005a , subasavage et al",

    "the most widespread method of revealing new members in the sun s vicinity is through proper motion searches , as nearby objects generally have larger proper motions than those further away .",
    "much of the nearby star work in the latter half of the twentieth century is based upon the palomar and uk schmidt sky surveys done by luyten ( luyten 1979a , 1979b ) and the lowell proper motion surveys by giclas ( giclas et al .",
    "1971 ; giclas et al .  1978a , 1978b ) .",
    "long - term efforts to obtain optical photometry by weis ( weis 1996 ) in the northern hemisphere and eggen ( eggen 1987 ) in the southern hemisphere were carried out by observing one star at a time . this photometry is often used to estimate distances to stars using various color - absolute magnitude calibrations .",
    "much of these data were then incorporated into the catalog of nearby stars ( cns , gliese and jahrei  1991 ) , which provided a snapshot view of the solar neighborhood population , albeit one that was incomplete .",
    "nstars continued in this vein with a comprehensive database of objects with trigonometric parallaxes ( see henry et al .",
    "2002 and henry et al .",
    "2003 for more complete discussions . ) . as we entered the twenty - first century , large sky surveys such as 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , denis ( the denis consortium 2005 ) , and sdss ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2009 ) gathered magnitudes in optical and infrared filters of huge numbers of sources that could be examined for nearby star candidates .",
    "once a new nearby star candidate is found , distances can be determined using a variety of astrometric , photometric , and spectrophotometric techniques . in this paper , we focus on distance estimates made using photometry from a combination of optical ccds and infrared arrays , which is an effective intermediate method for refining membership of the solar neighborhood .",
    "this method provides distances that are more accurate than those determined using photographic plates , but that are not as precise ( or as time and labor intensive ) as those calculated via trigonometric parallax .",
    "a primary goal of the recons group ( the research consortium on nearby stars ) is to identify hidden members of the solar neighborhood within 25 pc to match the horizons of the cns and nstars efforts .",
    "we have focused our searches in the southern hemisphere because that portion of the sky has been historically underrepresented and is expected to yield rich treasures in the form of new stellar neighbors . in this paper",
    ", we first discuss recent photometric distance efforts by others (  2 ) , then provide descriptions of our two methods used to estimate distances photometrically : via scanned photographic plates (  3 ) and improvements based on ccd photometry (  4 ) , with complementary spectroscopy (  5 ) .",
    "we sum up the results in  6 .",
    "table 1 lists the main photometric distance estimation efforts in the southern sky since the nstars database was compiled .",
    "the efforts considered are purely photometric and are independent of any spectral types or relations based on spectroscopy .",
    "the criteria for inclusion in the counts are that the systems ( 1 ) be new discoveries , ( 2 ) have colors of red dwarfs ( effectively spectral type m , ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 3.0 ) , ( 3 ) be found in the southern hemisphere ( dec @xmath9  0@xmath13 ) , and ( 4 ) are estimated to be within 25.0 pc via a photometric distance estimate .",
    "we used the nstars database as a benchmark to evaluate solar neighborhood completeness , as nstars incorporated only those objects for which a parallax had been measured ; therefore , it was the most definitive collection of systems found within 25 pc .",
    "great care was taken when extracting the sample of 329 southern m dwarf systems from nstars .",
    "all northern hemisphere objects , as well as those objects brighter than @xmath14 @xmath15 9.00 , the adopted cutoff for the brightest m dwarfs , were eliminated . for the remaining objects with no designated spectral type , various colors such as ( @xmath16 ) , ( @xmath17 ) , and ( @xmath18 ) , depending on the availability of photometry , were used to eliminate white dwarfs that remained in the sample . if the primary component of a multiple system was discovered to be anything other than an m dwarf , or if the system contained a white dwarf , the system was omitted . finally , the individual components of multiple systems were combined to give a count of southern m dwarf systems .",

    "note that the lack of a general increase in errors for fainter stars is caused by observers increasing integration times to provide adequate signal - to - noise on even the faintest targets .",
    "nonetheless , these red dwarfs are faintest at @xmath37 , so the resulting errors are somewhat larger than at @xmath31 and @xmath10 . at @xmath37 , 94% of the objects presented have total errors of 0.06 mag or less ; for @xmath31 and @xmath10 , this statistic is 99% .",

( 2004 ) , are found using a method similar to that used for the photographic plate distance estimates .",
    "the difference is that we use the accurate @xmath3 magnitudes obtained at ctio instead of @xmath5 plate magnitudes from supercosmos .",

    "twenty - three systems are estimated to be beyond 25 pc using ccd distance estimates .",
    "the two most likely causes of the distance offsets are poor plate photometry compared to ccd photometry and close multiples that are unresolved on the plates but resolved in ccd images .",
    "errors in the plate photometry certainly cause most of the discrepancies . a distance of up to @xmath2135 pc is possible if the object is an unresolved binary in which the two components are identical and contribute an equal amount of light to the measured magnitude .",

    "one object ( scr2335 - 6433b in the upper right of figures 5 and 6 ) is a common proper motion companion that was discovered by eye when blinking plates .",
    "the remaining seven objects had 3@xmath198 plate relations contributing to their distance estimates rather than the full suite of 11 , indicative of inaccurate estimates .",
    "the corresponding ccd distances for these objects often rely on 6@xmath1910 relations rather than the full suite of 12 , typically because they are bluer than some of the plate and ccd distance relations .",
    "three of the eight objects have already been verified to be k dwarfs via spectroscopy .      when using both the plate and ccd distance estimating suites , there is inherent spread around the fit line for each relation that is a result of two causes : ( 1 ) the deviations due to errors in parallax and photometry for the stars used to derive the fits , and ( 2 ) cosmic scatter due to differences in stellar ages , compositions , and perhaps magnetic properties .",
    "cosmic scatter dominates the offsets between distance estimates and true distances .",
    "unresolved , unknown multiples may also contribute , although great care was taken to remove such systems before the fits were made , so this is not a significant issue . in order to estimate the reliability of the suites of relations in both the plate and ccd methods , we have run single , main sequence , red dwarfs with known trigonometric distances back through the relations to derive representative errors .",
    "the median offsets between the trigonometric and photometric distance estimate are 26% for the plate suite and 15% for the ccd suite .    for all errors on distance estimates listed in table 3 ,",
    "these percentage errors are combined in quadrature with each star s individual error , which comes from the up to 11 or 12 distances derived from the plate and ccd suites , respectively .",
    "figure 6 is the same as figure 5 , but with the total errors shown for both estimates .",
    "note that in no case can the plate distance estimate have an error less than 26% nor less than 15% for ccd distance estimate .",

    "this is likely due to the fact that only nine of the 12 ccd relations were in agreement for the primary .",
    "as all 12 relations were utilized in the distance estimate of the secondary , the true distance of the system is probably closer to that of the secondary .",
    "the majority of the objects ( 71 of 104 , or 68% of the sample ) have @xmath5614 because these new discoveries are fainter than those targeted by luyten in most of the southern sky . only the faint companion object discovered by eye during the blinking process ,",
    "scr2241 - 6119b ( @xmath57 17.23 ) , is fainter than ccd @xmath57 16 , a consequence of the plate @xmath57 16.5 cut - off chosen in our searches to date .",
