    "to consider the most simple models is sometimes necessary for studying the charge carrier and thermal transport in solids . indeed",
    "mathematical approximations used on more sophisticated models may make less evident , or even completely suppress , certain effects . for the transport",
    "coefficients the latter statement surely concerns the thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity . for studying the electrical resistivity theoretical methods",
    "are surely simpler , better developed and more reliable .    when there is more than a single scattering source the electrical resistivity is sufficiently accurately treated in metals under the assumption of matthiessen rule @xcite ( see exceptions in concluding remarks ) .",
    "further assumptions are necessary to find simple and effective expressions for the thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity .",
    "the gorter  nordheim rule@xcite , which is usually applied to treat the thermoelectric power , is based on the assumption of the mott(-jones ) formula validity , however , restricted to the elastic scattering @xcite and the adiabatic approximation @xcite . for the thermal conductivity the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is a usual basis on which the separation of the electronic and lattice contribution to the experimental thermal conductivity is made , whence for comparing experimental and theoretical data .",
    "the validity of the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is also restricted to elastic collisions . clearly to resolve the question of elasticity and inelasticity of the scattering is essential for comparing experimental data and theoretical laws in particular for the thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity .",
    "the most simple inelastic scattering model of the charge carriers by _ phonons _ describes most features @xcite of the thermoelectric power in normal metals .",
    "consequently , an approach well accounting for the energy transfer between the charge carriers and the scattering quasiparticles should be applied beyond that based on the mott formula@xcite .",
    "it is known that the elastic approximation is sufficient for considering the scattering of the conduction electrons by _",
    "static impurities_. this leads to a constant , temperature independent residual resistivity , when the potential is appropriately chosen and the electron gas is degenerate .",
    "the simplest and well founded potential which leads to the residual resistivity in metals is the screened coulomb potential ( or yukawa potential ) provided that impurity concentration is sufficiently low .",
    "phenomenological considerations @xcite show that without assuming a behavior for the electrical residual resistivity one can not explain the low temperature behavior of the _ electronic _ contribution to the _ thermal _ conductivity . at moderate temperatures , along with the scattering by phonons the impurity scattering explains the magnitude and the basic features of the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of normal nonmagnetic @xcite and even magnetic @xcite metals , provided that the magnetic moment in the latter is periodic and well localized .",
    "it was shown indeed in ref .",
    ", devoted solely to the thermal conductivity , @xmath0 , that the magnetic scattering was of equal importance to the impurity and the phonon scattering .",
    "however , @xmath0 was neither compared to the electrical resistivity @xmath1 , nor to the thermoelectric power @xmath2 , for example calculated in the same temperature interval in ref .. moreover the final results were not presented through standard functions such as the bloch  grneisen ones .",
    "we shall do so in the present paper , but confining ourselves to non magnetic impurity and phonon scattering only .    as in our previous papers",
    "we shall apply the ziman variational approach @xcite within the boltzmann equation formalism , an approach in which the notion of `` relaxation time '' is not used .",
    "thus , the relationship to the mott formula is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "however , terms responsible for elastic and inelastic scattering can be easily selected , at least when the conduction band is parabolic . within this approach",
    "one can generalize the matthiessen rule : we consider a superposition of the transition probabilities themselves within the boltzmann equation formalism @xcite instead of the ( integrated ) relaxation time components .",
    "therefore the electrical resistivity , the thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity are considered here with respect to impurity and phonon scattering on the same ground , _",
    "i.e. _ both model and approximations . for this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to introduce a single parameter which accounts for the mutual contribution of the phonon and the impurity scattering to the transport coefficients .",
    "a similar model accounting for the scattering by phonons and impurities was considered in the fifties @xcite within the kohler variational formalism @xcite . however , the mathematical method was more complicated and less physical than that developed later by ziman @xcite .",
    "it did not allow @xcite to get qualitatively correct results for the thermoelectric power in contrast to those for the electrical resistivity and the electronic thermal conductivity .",
    "the finding of an accurate solution of the ( bloch)boltzmann equation is not a past problem of the fifties or the seventies but still a present  day problem .",
    "numerical methods are used for this purpose .",

    "an analysis of appropriate material constants allowing to estimate the magnitude of the final transport coefficients is found in appendix b. section v contains the concluding remarks .",
    "we assume that the current carriers are free electrons with a parabolic isotropic energy band @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "we also assume that the concentration of the electron gas ( of both subbands with spin up or down ) @xmath4 ( or the fermi energy @xmath5 ) is sufficiently high to consider the gas to be degenerate .",
    "then one can assume that the chemical potential is @xmath6 , and all relevant functions of @xmath7 can be considered as asymptotic expressions of the argument @xmath8 . in particular",

    "the carriers are assumed to be scattered by static , nonmagnetic impurities , which concentration is sufficiently low to have a linear influence on the electrical resistivity .",
    "the scattering of carriers by phonons will be considered on the same footing .",
    "however , the phonon ( quasiparticle ) scattering will be treated as inelastic while the impurity scattering is elastic in its nature , since the impurity is usually assumed to be more heavy than the electron effective mass . even though some calculations can be performed without assuming the form of the potential ) we assume the form of the impurity potential to be the screened ( yukawa ) potential    [ 3 ] u ( ) = - with @xmath10 , @xmath11 the effective valence and the screening constant @xmath12 .",

    "according to ziman@xcite , who examined the wilson formula , physically reasonable results for monovalent metals ( saturation and lack of minimum at intermediate temperatures ) are obtained when the umklapp scattering is taken into account .",
    "experimental results for rare earth intermetallic compounds exhibit the existence of a minimum at temperatures such as those seen in figs . 3 and 4 ( see e.g. fig .",

    "using a simple physical electron model , applying the ziman variational method within the boltzmann equation approach and using the same level of approximations for each property we have calculated the phonon - limited electrical resistivity , thermoelectric power and the electronic thermal conductivity of a simple metal and studied how the presence of charged impurities influences these transport coefficients .",
    "the method allows us to determine the temperature dependence of the coefficients in a wide temperature interval and to express them in terms of simple and standard functions already useful for examining experimental data .",
    "however we are aware that to take into account a more complicated band structure is surely necessary in many cases . in this purpose",
    "the allen method@xcite is surely more appropriate though the task needs to bear upon numerical technicalities from the very beginning .",
    "note that the latter method is strictly applicable to metallic systems , when the electron gas is degenerate , while by using the method of this present paper one advantage is that one can easily consider semiconductor or semimetallic systems as well @xcite .",
    "a comment is in order on the results of the present paper obtained in the limit of the degenerate electron gas . as concerns the electrical resistivity and the electronic thermal conductivity ( or resistivity )",
    "the final results are qualitatively the same as those obtained previously in refs .. in the case of the thermoelectric power however we can obtain a new evidence as a conclusion , i.e. the maximum at intermediate temperatures is caused by the energy transfer between the conduction electrons and phonons@xcite and is lowered as a result of the elastic scattering of the electrons on impurities .",
    "the final formal expression for the electronic thermal resistivity reads as a simple expression : this quantity is proportional to the scattering matrix element @xmath58 , much like the electrical resistivity is proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "the result is in fact model independent and is a consequence of confining the scattering matrix to four elements ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the range of applicability of the method we have used here above can not be finally discussed without referring to papers using more general and sophisticated methods and/or models . in the first place this concerns the papers in which the electron transport was studied within the formalism of the boltzmann equation@xcite . in the second place",
    "a relation to the linear response theory @xcite and the quantum transport equation @xcite will be given .",
    "however , by using these methods one can not obtain simple , compact , and useful expressions for the three transport coefficients , moreover being valid in the wide temperature region experimentally studied .",
    "further complications have also to be expected when taking into account the phonon drag @xcite , the virtual recoil @xcite or the electron  phonon renormalisation @xcite .",
    "let us start our discussion with a comparison of our model and results with the other ones obtained by the ziman variational method within the formalism of the boltzmann equation . as we stressed at the beginning we confined ourselves to a model of the parabolic electron band and the debye model of the phonon system .",
    "this oversimplified model allowed us to gain a coherent and qualitatively correct description of the three transport coefficients : the electrical resistivity , thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity ( resistivity ) for a simple and standard model of the scattering .",
    "any generalization of these results to an arbitrary band structure requires numerical studies at an initial stage .",
    "a compact formula in this general case of the ziman variational method has been obtained only for the electrical resistivity among the three coefficients , a formula which has been called ",
    "ziman s resistivity formula",
    "it has been used to compute the electrical resistivity for a realistic fermi surface .    again a more exact method is that of allen@xcite though a numerical one .",
    "the electrical resistivity is again simplest to compute but the results for the thermal conductivity @xcite and the thermoelectric power @xcite were also obtained by this method .",
    "the essence of the method is the separation of the @xmath63-variation during the scattering into two types : ( i ) an  angular variation  over the fermi surface , and ( ii ) a  radial  variation with @xmath106 perpendicular to the fermi surface describing the inelastic electron scattering .",
    "it is obvious from our results for the thermoelectric power @xcite that taking into account inelastic electron scattering , which is equivalent to considering a sufficient number of harmonics describing the radial variation within the allen formalism , is of major importance for obtaining a correspondence to experimental results if the scattering of the electrons by excitations such as phonons is to be accounted . in ref .",
    ", in which the lowest order radial harmonic was considered and the analysis was in fact restricted to the mott formula , a poor correspondence to the experimental results for the thermoelectric power was obtained .",

    "according to our knowledge no such considerations were made to analyze the influence of the electron  phonon scattering neither on the thermal conductivity nor the thermoelectric power .    the assumed statistical independence between the impurities as scattering centers restrict our considerations to low impurity concentration .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental fact that the matthiessen rule is valid below a critical residual resistivity @xcite above which the @xmath107 low temperature dependence ( following , for instance , from the bloch  grneisen dependence of the electrical resistivity ) ceases to be valid .",
    "one can hardly estimate such a critical concentration without analyzing a specific system and experimental results .    to estimate the magnitude of the transport coefficients out of the reduced values illustrated on each figure in sec .",
    "iv we present the order of magnitude of the relevant material constants in appendix b. the magnitude of @xmath70 in table i is the same as in ref . and corresponds to the magnitude of the sound velocity and the effective electron mass(es ) of real materials .",
    "we start our discussion of more sophisticated methods than the boltzmann equation formalism by noting that in the linear response theory the validity of the matthiesen rule , which was assumed by us in a generalized version , is related to the fact that the self - energy of the conduction electrons is the same as the sum of the phonon and impurity self - energy @xcite .",
    "this holds only in the lowest born approximation .",
    "when higher order processes are taken into account , _",
    "i.e. _ , when interference between the electron - phonon and electron - impurity interaction is to be considered , the keldysh quantum transport equation formalism @xcite is apparently better .    in ref",
    ". the same model as in the present paper was considered to study the influence of the electron - phonon - impurity interference on the thermoelectric power .",
    "a considerable nonlinearity of @xmath2 as a function of temperature was found , the stronger the higher impurity effective charge .",
    "the effect can be hardly compared with that studied in the present paper since it has been obtained under an assumption of elasticity for the electron - phonon scattering whereas the assumption of inelasticity of the electron - phonon scattering is essential @xcite for obtaining the maximum of @xmath2 found in the present paper and ref .",
    "note that as a result of a weak elastic impurity scattering ( considered within the born approximation ) the bump in @xmath2 is found to be lowered with the strength of the impurity interaction or the impurity concentration .",
    "the electron - phonon renormalization @xcite leads also to a nonlinearity of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath108 .",
    "the effect was studied under the assumption of elastic electron - phonon interaction or in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "again there can be no discussion between our results and those in ref . and",
    "except for the region of very low temperatures , where the effect of elasticity and renormalization are not effective and where @xmath2 is a linear function of @xmath108 with the same slope @xcite as in the pure crystal @xcite .",
    "though the impurity scattering is known to play an important role in the thermal conductivity at least in the low temperature region there is a very limited number of papers devoted to this coefficient aspect .",
    "the basic difficulties and problems related to applying the methods of the linear response formalism to treating the electronic thermal conductivity problem in the pure electron - phonon system are described in ref .. however , such considerations as those in ref .",
    "have not be generalized for a system with impurities . on the other hand the considerations of refs .",
    ", devoted to thermoelectric effects for a model of debye phonons with fixed impurities , have not been used by these authors in an appropriate way to consider the electronic thermal conductivity .",
    "therefore , a complete theory of the electronic thermal conductivity still requires a thorough consideration of the mutual role of the electron - phonon - impurity interference , phonon renormalization and elasticity of the scattering , much the same as on the thermoelectric power . for comparison to data , in not too good metals ,",
    "the phonon heat contribution should be also taken into account for the thermal conductivity .",
    "a question may arise if our results can be compared to experimental ones in a straightforward , quantitative way .",
    "the answer seems that these are the alkali metals , which exhibit essentially spherical fermi surface to within a few per cent , that should be first of all considered as materials for the comparison .",
    "it occurs , however , that the phonon system and the electron ",
    "phonon interaction in these metals are too complicated to be well accounted by the applied approximations .",
    "it concerns in the first place , ( i ) , the continuous medium approximation used to treat the phonon system and the deformation potential approximation applied to the electron ",
    "phonon interaction ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . in the second place , ( ii ) ,",
    "the debye approximation is insufficient for the alkali metals .",
    "finally , in the description of the electron scattering we also neglect the umklapp processes , which occur important even at very low temperatures @xcite in the alkali metals .    the approximations",
    "( i ) mean that the longitudinal phonons of long wavelength are only considered , whereas the transverse phonons @xcite and those of short wavelength ( contributing also to the umklapp process ) have to be taken into account @xcite . due to a strong elastic anisotropy the debye approximation ( ii ) is not appropriate even at low temperatures since a constant frequency surface is distorted from the debye spherical form @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the strong influence of the electronic system on the behavior of the phonons cause that the basic symmetry relations between the elastic constants ( cauchy relations ) are no longer valid @xcite and , therefore , even the basic results following from the continuous medium approximation of ref . may be questioned .",
    "all these factors cause that the simple bloch approach have to be used with a great caution in attempts of the _ quantitative _ description of the electrical and thermal transport in the alkali metals .    the most early investigations @xcite of the alkali metals indicated that one can fix such parameters as those of appendix b to fit the experimental electrical resistivity to the bloch ",
    "grneisen function , provided that the temperature is not too low .",
    "thorough analysis @xcite based on the measured phonon spectra of the alkali metals @xcite showed later that the problem is more complicated and the effects mentioned by us above have to be in fact taken into account .",
    "therefore , even in case of these simplest metals the correct quantitative theory based on first principles is in fact impossible and a quantitative analysis have to be based on a cross section for the scattering of the conduction electrons written in terms of the phonon spectrum resulting from neutron scattering data @xcite .",
    "precise experimental measurements of the transport coefficients of the alkali metals at low temperatures @xcite support this conjuncture and reveals other physical effects which should be taken into account for a proper quantitative analysis in this temperature region .    as concerns",
    "the thermoelectric power our results indicate that other factors than those in case of the electrical resistivity are important .",
    "the impurity scattering occurred less essential than expected . within the assumed model",
    "this is the parameter @xmath70 which besides @xmath5 is solely responsible for the strength of the inelastic scattering of electrons by phonons and controls the magnitude and sign of @xmath2 .",
    "the obtained temperature dependence of @xmath2 is the same in character as that obtained experimentally @xcite for all the the alkali metals except li ( which exhibits a peculiar behavior @xcite but the fermi surface of which comes closest to the brillouin zone boundaries ) . in search for",
    "a quantitative theory of @xmath109 of a specific metal one should also estimate the order of the contribution of the phonon drag @xcite , that following from the electron  phonon renormalization @xcite and the electron  phonon",
    " impurity interference .",
    "the described above factors which influence the electrical resistivity in the alkali metals may occur of secondary importance .",
    "the effects of the impurity scattering manifest in most pronounced way in the behavior of the thermal conductivity but due to the validity the wiedemann ",
    "franz law in the limit of low temperatures the effects of the impurity scattering can be easily extracted out of our results at low temperatures for a comparison with experimental ones @xcite .",
    "as concerns the comparison of the values of appropriate coefficients following from the theory and experimental data for the alkali metals the same problems as in case of the studies of the electrical resistivity may arise . the umklapp process",
    "are expected to be less dominant at low temperatures than in case of the electrical resistivity but the electron ",
    "electron interactions may occur essential for the thermal conductivity since both the experimental and theoretical investigations indicate @xcite that electron ",
