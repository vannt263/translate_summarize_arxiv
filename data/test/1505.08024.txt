    "let @xmath0 be a coxeter system .",
    "there is a canonical real representation of @xmath1 which is called the _ geometric representation _ of @xmath0 and which is known to be faithful by the work of tits in the 1960s ( a proof can be found in @xcite . in the proof",
    "he considers a convex cone @xmath2 in the dual module which is stabilized under the action of @xmath1 . by means of the standard generating set @xmath3",
    "he defines an open simplicial cone @xmath4 which turns out to be a prefundamental domain for the action of @xmath1 on @xmath2 .",
    "it is now the standard terminology to call the cone @xmath2 the _ tits cone _ and @xmath4 the _ ( open ) fundamental chamber_. the conjugates of the fundamental generators act as linear reflections on the module and its dual .",
    "their reflection hyperplanes yield a simplicial decomposition of @xmath2 and thus provide a simplicial complex which is the _ coxeter complex _ of @xmath0 . the geometric representation of @xmath0 , the geometry of the tits cone , and the properties of the coxeter complex are fundamental tools for the investigation of coxeter groups .",
    "coxeter systems play an important role in various branches of mathematics . in combinatorics and",
    "geometric group theory they are a rich source of interesting phenomena ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in representation theory and the theory of algebraic groups the _ crystallographic _ coxeter systems occur as _ weyl groups _ of several structures .",
    "there , they play the role of basic invariants , often called the _ type _ of the algebraic object under consideration .    in @xcite and @xcite _ weyl groupoids _ and their root systems have been introduced as basic invariants of nichols algebras .",
    "their definition emerged from earlier work in @xcite and @xcite , they are natural generalizations of weyl groups .",
    "weyl groupoids of finite type are those which generalize finite weyl groups .",
    "these have been studied intensively in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where a classification has been obtained .",
    "this classification is considerably harder than the classification of the finite weyl groups .",
    "it was observed by the first two authors in 2009 that the final outcome of this classification in rank 3 is intimately related to grnbaum s list of simplicial arrangements in @xcite .",
    "there is an obvious explanation of this connection : to each weyl groupoid one can associate a tits cone which is the whole space if and only if the weyl groupoid is of finite type .",
    "based on these considerations , _ crystallographic _ arrangements have been introduced in @xcite , where it is shown that their classification is a consequence of the classification of finite weyl groupoids .    in view of the importance of the tits cone and the coxeter complex for the understanding of coxeter systems it is natural to investigate their analogues in the context of weyl groupoids .",
    "although it is intuitively clear what has to be done in order to generalize these notions , there are instances where things have to be modified or some extra argument is needed . our intention is to provide the basic theory of the tits cone and the coxeter complex of a weyl groupoid .",
    "this paper deals with the combinatorial aspects of this project and therefore the crystallographic condition does nt play a role at all . hence",
    ", here we deal with _",
    "tits arrangements _ rather than with weyl groupoids .",
    "the basic strategy for setting up the framework is to start with a simplicial arrangement @xmath5 on a convex open cone @xmath2 and to investigate the abstract simplicial complex @xmath6 associated with it .",
    "this is a _ gated chamber complex _ and has therefore a natural type function .",
    "we call a simplicial arrangement on a convex open cone a tits arrangement if @xmath7 is a thin chamber complex and introduce the notion of a root system of a tits arrangement . given a simplicial arrangement of rank @xmath8 on an open convex cone , there are two canonical procedures to produce simplicial arrangements of smaller rank",
    ".    we would like to point out that this paper is meant to be a contribution to the foundations of the theory of weyl groupoids of arbitrary type .",
    "the concepts and ideas are at least folklore and several of the results for which we give proofs are well established in the literature .",
    "the only exception is probably our systematic use of gated chamber complexes at some places .",
    "our principal goal here is to provide a fairly complete account of the basic theory of the tits cone of a weyl groupoid by developing the corresponding notions to the extent that is needed for just this purpose .",
    "therefore , we have decided to include short proofs for standard facts and refer to other sources only when we need a more elaborate result .",
    "we are not able to give a systematic account of the origins of the concepts and ideas which play a role in this paper . here",
    "are some comments based on the best of our knowledge :    1 .",
    "simplicial arrangements were first introduced and studied by melchior @xcite and subsequently by grnbaum @xcite . shortly afterwards , simplicial arrangements attracted attention in the seminal work of deligne @xcite : they are a natural context to study the @xmath9 property of complements of reflection arrangements , since the set of reflection hyperplanes of a finite coxeter group is a simplicial arrangement .",
    "they further appeared as examples or counterexamples to conjectures on arrangements .",
    "2 .   we do not know where arrangements of hyperplanes on convex cones were considered for the first time .",
    "the concept seems most natural and they are mentioned in @xcite without further reference .",
    "of course , our definition of a simplicial arrangement on an open convex cone is inspired by the tits cone of a coxeter system .",
    "the fact that arrangements of hyperplanes provide interesting examples of gated sets in metric spaces appears in @xcite for the first time . at least in the simplicial case",
    "it was observed much earlier @xcite .",
    "the observation that there is a natural link between root systems and simplicial arrangements is quite natural .",
    "we already mentioned that it was our starting point to investigate the tits - cone of a weyl groupoid .",
    "but it also appears in dyer s work on rootoids @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the observation was made much earlier by other people and is hidden somewhere in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sec : ex ] we will provide some basic examples for our objects of interest .",
    "these will be used for later reference , since they are either basic examples or counterexamples for the properties which we introduce .",
    "like in example [ exm : thinf ] , the geometric representation of a coxeter group is a prominent sample for simplicial arrangements .    in section [ sec : hyp ]",
    "we fix notation and develop the notion of a hyperplane arrangement on an open convex cone in a real vector space @xmath10 .",
    "we introduce the common substructures for these objects , i.  e.  subarrangements and restrictions .",
    "furthermore we define the chamber graph of an arrangement and show that parabolic subsets of the set of chambers are gated subsets with respect to the canonical metric .",
    "in section [ sec : tits ] we introduce simplicial arrangements and tits arrangements .",
    "we add additional combinatorial structure to a tits arrangement by associating to the set of hyperplanes a set of roots , linear forms which define the hyperplanes .",
    "with respect to the study of nichols algebras root systems with additional properties will be interesting , however in this paper we deal with roots systems as very general objects .",
    "we also associate to a simplicial arrangement a canonical simplicial complex .",
    "the main results regarding this complex are proven in the appendix .",
    "in section [ subarr ] we consider subarrangements and restrictions of simplicial arrangements and tits arrangements .",
    "we give criteria when the substructures of a simplicial / tits arrangement is again a simplicial / tits arrangement , and in the case of a tits arrangement we describe canonical root systems .",
    "the appendix provides proofs for the properties of the poset associated to a simplicial hyperplane arrangement which are stated in section 4 . while most of these properties are quite intuitive , a rigid proof can be tedious .",
    "appendix [ app : simpcomp ] recalls the basic definitions of simplicial complexes as we need them .    in appendix [ app :",
    "s ] we show that the poset @xmath11 associated to a simplicial hyperplane arrangement @xmath12 is indeed a simplicial complex .",
    "the results of this section are summarized in proposition [ ssimpcomp ] .",
    "in particular , we provide an equivalent definition for simplicial cones , which has an implicit simplicial structure .",
    "appendix [ app : scc ] provides the remaining properties of @xmath13 .",
    "the first part recalls the definitions of chamber complexes and type functions .",
    "in the second part it is shown that @xmath13 is a gated chamber complex with a type function , a collection of the results can be found in proposition [ prop - sproperties ] .",
    "we also show that the notions of being spheric and thin , which we introduced for simplicial hyperplane arrangements before , coincide with the classical notions for chamber complexes",
