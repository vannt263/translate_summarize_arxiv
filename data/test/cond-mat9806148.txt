    "a good example of connection between micro- and macroscopic quantities is the determination of surface stress from the measurement of macroscopic deformations of a thin plate - shaped sample . according to elasticity theory @xcite ,",
    "if a thin plate presents a stress difference between its two surfaces , it will bend in order to minimize its total free energy . in the limit of small deformations",
    ", a simple formula connects stress difference , thickness , curvature and elastic properties of the sample .",
    "several methods have been recently used to measure the bending .",
    "they are mainly optical or based on scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite .",
    "flinn , gardner and nix @xcite discussed a laser scanning technique to measure the stress - induced curvature , and presented experimental results for stress in al - si films as a function of temperature .",
    "martinez , augustyniak and golovchenko @xcite measured surface - stress changes resulting from monolayer and sub - monolayer coverages of gallium on si@xmath0 .",

    "stress variations associated with deconstruction of au@xmath0 and au@xmath2 were obtained by stm @xcite . moreover , the influence of adsorbates on surface stress has been exploited using the sample bending method for c / ni(111 ) @xcite , s / ni(111 ) @xcite , co / ni(100 ) @xcite , k / pt(111 ) @xcite , co / pt(111 ) @xcite , ag / pt(111 ) @xcite .",
    "an atomistic simulation method which controls the curvature of a sample as an extra degree of freedom has not been available so far , although this would seem a potentially useful tool .",
    "the situations in which surface stress varies when physical phenomena occur at interfaces are numerous : adsorbates , reconstructions , steps , phase transitions can change surface stress dramatically .",
    "all of these phenomena are , under some conditions , well described by suitable md simulations .",
    "a simulation method where the slab curvature can be measured as a function of adsorbate coverage should represent a powerful connection between important microscopic and macroscopic quantities .",
    "in this work we describe and demonstrate a scheme which is meant to fill this gap .",
    "it is a classical md method , but it could in principle be extended to _ ab initio _ md calculations .",
    "it is based on extending the usual concept of variable cell md , pionereed by andersen @xcite and by parrinello and rahman @xcite , to a slab with variable curvature . in our formulation",
    "the curvature is a single , global lagrangian degree of freedom .",
    "surface stress can be extracted as a direct result of the calculation through elasticity equations @xcite , which will be described below .",
    "the outline of the work is as follows : section [ sec2 ] will present the theory and geometric considerations underlying our simulation . in [ sec3 ]",
    "the phenomenology of a bent plate is reviewed in order to extract the pertinent equations . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present some initial applications of the method .",
    "finally , section [ sec5 ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in ordinary variable - cell md , the coordinates of an atom can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the position vector of the @xmath5-th particle , @xmath6 are scaled coordinates ( @xmath7 are held between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is a matrix describing the space metric inside the cell .",
    "supposing , as was done by parrinello and rahman @xcite , that the cell can vary in volume and shape , these variations can be accounted for by @xmath10 , whose elements can be treated as an extra set of dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "our aim is to extend this kind of approach to the case of a bending plate , through a different choice of the metric @xmath11 .",
    "let us start with a slab - shaped system , with two surfaces and lateral @xmath12 periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "suppose we bend the slab cylindrically through a radius @xmath13 ( see figure 1 ) . a convenient choice of the transformation matrix , convenient to our problem , could be the following :    @xmath14    where @xmath10 , depending parametrically on the radius of curvature @xmath15 , is no longer uniform ( as in the parrinello - rahman scheme ) , but rather depends on the point @xmath16 .",
    "this dependence is what originates the curvature . in figure 1 , for example , @xmath17 goes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 along @xmath18 , which we choose to be unaffected by curvature , @xmath19 goes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 along direction @xmath20 which follows the curvature , and @xmath21 spans the sample from its inner to its outer surface .    from now on , we will use as reference surface an ideal `` neutral cylinder '' inside the slab , defined by @xmath22 . in particular , we define the curvature @xmath23 as the inverse radius of the neutral cylinder : @xmath24 in this way , if @xmath25 is the linear dimension ( arc ) along the bending direction at @xmath26 , the total bending angle is given by @xmath27 . whereas in the parrinello - rahman approach the whole matrix @xmath10 is treated as a set of additional degrees of freedom , in our case @xmath10 is completely determined by the single parameter @xmath23 which we will include in the lagrangian as an extra degree of freedom .",
    "the next step is the construction of a lagrangian .",
    "the general , classical lagrangian for a @xmath28-particle interacting system is : @xmath29 in cartesian coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the metric tensor@xcite .",
    "we now define an extended lagrangian @xmath33 by including an artificial `` curvature kinetic energy '' : @xmath34 where @xmath35 acts effectively as a  curvature inertial mass  .",
    "the velocity of a particle can be written as : @xmath36 or explicitly @xmath37 \\,s^\\beta + h_{\\alpha \\beta } \\,\\dot{s}^\\beta .",
    "\\label{eq : time_derivative}\\ ] ] the third term is the usual time derivative for the constant - cell motion , whereas the second term contains a time derivative of the extra degree of freedom @xmath23 .",
    "as in the parrinello - rahman formulation @xcite , we will omit this term from the definition of the particle velocities .",
    "the kinetic energy of the system will therefore depend on @xmath38 only through the curvature kinetic energy , @xmath39 whose interpretation is discussed in appendix a. parrinello and rahman @xcite and andersen @xcite , using a similar approach , showed that the equations of motion derived from their lagrangian satisfy important requisites , leading in particular to correct thermodynamic averages ( not dependent on the choice of @xmath35 ) , and to a correct balance between external and internal stress .",
    "one can then cast ( [ eq : time_derivative ] ) as @xmath40 \\,%",
    "\\dot{s}^\\beta \\doteq m_{\\alpha \\beta } \\,\\dot{s}^\\beta .\\ ] ]",
    "the kinetic energy of a particle then becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42    we need now to express the potential energy in terms of the scaled coordinates and of the metric . in the following",
    ", we will use mostly potentials ( such as pairwise potentials or many - body potentials of the ` glue ' form ) which only depend on pair distances : @xmath43 it is therefore necessary to express @xmath44 in the new coordinates @xcite . denoting the metric tensor as @xmath45 we have",
    "@xmath46    we now have all the ingredients needed to write the @xmath47 lagrange equations @xmath48      to obtain an explicit form for ( [ eq : r_and_s ] ) and ( [ eq : motion ] ) we write the expression for the cartesian coordinates in a box with linear dimensions ( at @xmath26 ) @xmath49 , @xmath25 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the angle running along the @xmath20 direction , @xmath53 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "with the help of simple trigonometric formul , we can express @xmath54 in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath23 : @xmath55 whence equations ( [ eq : coor_tran ] ) become : @xmath56 by inspection , we see that a possible choice for @xmath10 is : @xmath57    it can be easily shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_and_s ] ) is verified and that , in the limit of zero curvature , @xmath58 $ ] , that is , the cartesian @xmath10 matrix is recovered .",
    "moreover , the same equations are exact in the limit of finite , fixed curvature",
    ".    the explicit form of @xmath59 can be obtained by using equations ( [ eq : t1 ] ) and ( [ eq : h_matrix ] ) : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath59 is diagonal as a consequence of the chosen cylindrical geometry .",
    "the lagrange equations are integrated using numerical methods . in particular",
    ", we will use a second order velocity verlet algorithm , which is at the same time well - tested and simple .",
    "we found some problems due to the instability of the center of mass of the sample during the bending , which were overcome and will be commented just below .",
    "our starting geometry is an @xmath62layer crystalline slab with pbc along the @xmath18 and @xmath20 directions .",
    "the periodicity is accounted for by the scaled coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath19 . along @xmath17 ,",
    "usual cartesian pbc are adopted .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath19 are also periodic , but the images of a point of coordinates @xmath63 have coordinates @xmath64 , and lie on the cylindrical surface @xmath65 .",
    "every point of the sample is equivalent along @xmath19 and so a `` translational '' invariance is still present , albeit in a curved geometry .    for @xmath66 the dynamics generated by ( [ eq : motion ] ) does not conserve the position of the center of mass of the slab along the radial direction @xmath21 . to keep the center of mass fixed , we resort to a constrained md scheme . constrained md is a well known technique , and we adopted the method used by ryckrt , ciccotti and berendsen @xcite and andersen @xcite for simulations of rigid molecules .",
    "the main point to be kept in mind is that constraints must be verified _",
    "exactly _ at every time step , otherwise instabilities will occur .",
    "technical details on the practical implementation of this constraint are given in appendix b.    the general md protocol we apply consists of either constant energy runs or constant temperature runs ( up to @xmath67 k ) obtained by velocity rescaling , followed by quenching to @xmath68 .",
    "occasionally , we also introduced a damping term in the curvature dynamics .",
    "we chose a typical time step of the order of @xmath69",
    "before moving on to the actual implementation , it is useful to recall some known results concerning the phenomenology , largely contained in the review by ibach @xcite .    the definition of surface stress , according to gibbs @xcite , as the `` reversible work per unit area required to stretch a surface elastically '' , points out the difference of this physical quantity with respect to the surface free energy , defined as the `` reversible work per unit area to create a surface '' . stretching a _ solid _ surface implies modifying the substrate , whereas a simple increase of area does not : whence the difference .",
    "let us start with the bulk stress tensor , whose element @xmath70 is defined as the @xmath5-th component of the force per unit area acting on the side ( with the normal to the surface parallel to the @xmath71-th direction ) of a small cube in the sample .",
    "the corresponding surface stress tensor can be defined as the deviation of this quantity with respect to the bulk value , integrated along the surface normal : @xmath72\\ ] ]    the integral gives non - zero contribution only where the value of the stress deviates from the bulk value , @xmath73 at the surface .",
    "let us consider a rectangular shaped sheet of thickness @xmath74 , delimited by two identical @xmath2 surfaces . for our purposes",
    "the following simplified construction can be put to use without loss of generality @xcite .",
    "schematize the plate at zero curvature as a  substrate  of thickness @xmath74 and length @xmath75 along @xmath76 plus two films adsorbed on it : film @xmath77 on the lower part of the plate , and film @xmath78 on the upper part .",
    "let @xmath79 the unconstrained length ( along @xmath80 ) of film @xmath81 and @xmath82 the length of film @xmath83 let @xmath84 and @xmath85 in order to match the length @xmath75 of the substrate , the film must be stretched ( compressed ) by an amount @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the deformed film attached to an undeformed substrate does not represent a condition of minimum free energy ;  the free energy of the entire system can be lowered by deforming the substrate slightly so as to reduce the deformation of the film .",
    "this deformation has two components : an overall compression of the substrate and a bending of the substrate .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the neutral plane ( _ i.e. _ the plane along which the strain is zero ) can be set approximately in the middle of the sheet , and the deviations from this approximation are negligible for most cases . in the following , we will extract the conditions for the minimum free energy of the sheet , allowed to bend along a single direction . for simplicity",
    ", we will choose this to be the @xmath88 $ ] direction ( of course similar formul can be derived for any other choice ) . if we denote the coordinates along the bending direction , the non - bending direction and the normal to the surface with @xmath89 and @xmath21 respectively , the situation is similar to the one depicted in figure 1 .",
    "each element of the sample is subject to a strain @xmath90 .",
    "the change in free energy per unit area associated to this strain , of an element at height @xmath21 is : @xmath91 the total free energy change of the bent sample ( per unit area ) is : @xmath92 we can separate this integral into two surface parts and a bulk part :    [ eq : utot ] @xmath93 { \\rm % d\\,\\varepsilon } _ { 11 }   \\label{eq : utotb } \\\\ u^{\\,\\left ( s-\\right ) } & = & \\int\\nolimits_{-\\frac t2}^{-\\frac t2+\\beta } { \\rm % d}s_3\\int\\nolimits_0^{\\varepsilon _ { 11}\\left ( \\,s_3\\right ) } \\left [ \\tau _ { 11}\\left ( \\,s_3\\right ) -\\tau _ { 11}^{\\left ( b\\right ) } \\right ] { \\rm % d\\,\\varepsilon } _ { 11 }   \\label{eq : utotc }",

    "hooke s law relates strain and bulk stress tensor components in the following way : @xmath96 in our case , @xmath97 therefore , after introducing young s modulus @xmath98 and poisson s ratio @xmath99 : @xmath100 one obtains @xcite : @xmath101 if we substitute ( [ eq : epstau ] ) into ( [ eq : utotd ] ) we obtain , after integration , @xmath102 the total free energy of the bent plate is then : @xmath103 minimizing @xmath104 with respect to the curvature , one obtains the equation relating the equilibrium curvature @xmath105 to the difference in surface stress between upper and lower surface :    @xmath106    where @xmath98 is the young s modulus , @xmath107 the poisson s number , @xmath105 the curvature and @xmath74 the thickness of the sample .",
    "this relation is known as stoney s equation , and was first derived in 1909 ( except for the biaxial nature of the stress @xcite ) . we stress that this formula is valid for a uniaxial bending , whereas for an isotropic bending in two directions the factor @xmath108 should be replaced by @xmath109 .",
    "another limit of validity is that the plate must be infinitely large , relative to its thickness . in other words",
    ", there will be finite thickness corrections in @xmath110 where @xmath75 is the lateral @xmath111 size .",
    "we did not make any attempt to find these corrections so far .    in the remainder of this section we present the simple derivation of the elastic constants two high symmetry surfaces : @xmath2 bent along @xmath112 $ ] , and @xmath0 .",
    "we start from the elastic stiffnesses @xmath113 which are related to the compliances @xmath114 by the equations @xcite : @xmath115 if the uniaxial bending is not along a @xmath88 $ ] direction and for surface orientations other than @xmath116 , the compliances @xmath117 and @xmath118 which appear in ( [ eq : young ] ) have to be replaced by effective elastic constants , which in the @xmath2 case , with bending along a @xmath112 $ ] direction , have the form :    @xmath119    whereas in the @xmath120 case have the form : @xmath121",
    "the first goal of the variable - curvature md simulation is to obtain an equilibrium value for the curvature in order to extract the surface stress difference , according to equation ( [ eq : stoney ] ) .",
    "we can then compare the outcome with the surface stress difference calculated independently using kirwood s formula @xcite , and assess the success of the method .",
    "we will also verify the validity of the approach by analyzing the behavior of the curvature as a function of the slab thickness .",
    "we will present two different exemplifications . far from being exhaustive , these results are only meant to show the feasibility of the method in view of later applications to surface physics .",
    "first we simulated several au slabs with ( 100 ) orientation and different types of reconstruction on the two sides .",
    "this test can show the sensitivity of the method : differences of the order of @xmath122 @xmath123 can be appreciated .",
    "next we examined the effect of isotropic or anisotropic adsorbates on the surface stress , as exemplified by pb / au(100 ) .    all simulations were performed using many - body potentials of the glue type @xcite .",
