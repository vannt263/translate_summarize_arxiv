    "it is generally accepted that studies of baryon form factors at large momentum transfer @xmath4 give access to the light - front wave functions at small transverse separations between the constituents , called hadron distribution amplitudes ( das ) , although perturbative qcd factorization @xcite does not seem to be applicable for realistic @xmath4 accessible in current or planned experiments .",
    "the problem is that the leading contribution involves two hard gluon exchanges and is suppressed by the small factor @xmath5 compared to the `` soft '' ( end - point ) contributions which are subleading in the power counting in @xmath6 but do not involve small coefficients .",
    "hence the collinear factorization regime is approached very slowly .",
    "model calculations suggest that `` soft '' contributions play the dominant role at present energies . taking into account soft contributions",
    "is challenging because they involve a nontrivial overlap of nonperturbative wave functions of the initial and the final state hadrons , and are not factorizable , i.e. can not be simplified further in terms of simpler quantities .    in this situation",
    "the question what exactly do we learn from the studies of form factors is far from trivial .",
    "one existing description is to introduce more complicated , transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) quark distributions , taking advantage of sudakov suppression of large transverse separations , following the technique suggested initially by li and sterman  @xcite for the pion form factor .",
    "another approach that we advocate in this work , is to calculate the soft contributions to the form factors as an expansion in terms of nucleon das of increasing twist using dispersion relations and duality .",
    "this method is known as light - cone sum rules ( lcsrs )  @xcite and provides one with the most direct relation of the hadron form factors and das that is available at present , with no other nonperturbative parameters .",
    "the lcsr approach has been used successfully for the calculations of pion electromagnetic and also weak @xmath7-decay form factors , see refs .",
    "@xcite for several recent state - of - the - art calculations .",
    "the lcsrs for baryon form factors are more complicated and recent .",
    "the first application was for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in refs .",
    "several further studies aimed at finding an optimal nucleon interpolation current  @xcite and extending this technique to other elastic or transition form factors of interest .",
    "lcsrs for the axial nucleon form factor were presented in @xcite , for the scalar form factor in @xcite and tensor form factor in @xcite . a generalization to the full baryon octet",
    "was considered e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "application of the same technique to @xmath8 transitions was suggested in  @xcite and to pion production at threshold in  @xcite .",
    "lcrss for weak baryon decays @xmath9 etc .",
    "were studied in @xcite , etc . in the early work",
    "only the leading order ( lo ) contributions to the coefficient functions in the lcsrs have been taken into account .",
    "the first complete next - to - leading order ( nlo ) analysis was done for the electromagnetic nucleon form factors in ref .",
    "@xcite and the results appear to be consistent with the constraints on nucleon das from lattice calculations  @xcite . the picture emerging from these studies sugggests that the momentum fraction distribution of the valence quarks in the proton is rather broad , with @xmath10 of the momentum carried by the @xmath11-quark that carries proton helicity , and approximately symmetric to the interchange of the remaining quarks .",
    "our study is motivated by the dedicated experiment planned with the hall b clas12 detector at jefferson lab following the 12 gev upgrade , with the aim to study electroproduction of nucleon resonances at high photon virtualities up to @xmath0  gev@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding form factors can be calculated using the lcsr machinery in terms of the das of nucleon resonances . turning this relation around , information on the das of resonances",
    "can be extracted from the comparison of the lcsr calculations with the experimental data on form factors and compared to the constraints that can come , eventually , from lattice qcd simulations .",
    "this program was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and an exploratory study was made there for the particular case of electroproduction of the lowest negative parity @xmath12 resonance . in our paper",
    "we elaborate on this proposal .",
    "learning about quark distributions in nucleon resonances is an exciting possibility , since existing qcd calculations of resonance properties , e.g. on the lattice , rarely go beyond the mass spectrum .",
    "the case of @xmath12 is special because the classification and the structure of the light - front wave functions for the states with opposite parity is almost identical .",
    "hence the lcsrs for the corresponding electroproduction form factors are very similar to the lcsrs for electromagnetic nucleon form factors .",
    "in particular the nlo expressions derived in ref .",
    "@xcite can be overtaken with relatively minor modifications .",
    "a detailed analysis of these nlo lcsrs is the main goal of this work .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows .",
    "the electroproduction form factors are introduced and the structure of the corresponding lcsrs is explained in sect .  2 .",
    "3 contains a detailed numerical analysis and comparison with the existing experimental data , and sect .",
    "4 is reserved for a summary and outlook . a large appendix  a contains",
    "a short review of the three - quark light - front wave functions of @xmath13 nucleon resonances , their relation to das , and also explains our conventions .",
    "appendix b contains a simple parametrization of the @xmath4 dependence of the coefficient functions in the lcsrs .",
    "the matrix element of the electromagnetic current @xmath14 between spin-1/2 states of opposite parity can be parametrized in terms of two independent form factors , which can be chosen as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the momentum transfer . in what follows we use the standard notation @xmath17 .",
    "the helicity amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the electroproduction of @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of the form factors @xcite : @xmath20 , \\nonumber \\\\ { s}_{1/2}&=   \\frac{e bc } { \\sqrt{2 } } \\big[(m_{n}\\!-\\!m_{n^*})g_1(q^2)+m_{n}g_2(q^2)\\big ] .",
    "\\label{def : a12s12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the elementary charge and @xmath7 , @xmath22 are kinematic factors defined as @xmath23    the basic object of the lcsr approach to baryon form factors  @xcite is the correlation function @xmath24 in which @xmath25 represents the electromagnetic ( or weak ) probe and @xmath26 is a suitable local operator with nucleon quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath27 resonance is explicitly represented by its state vector @xmath28 , see a schematic representation in fig .",
    "[ figsum ] .",
    "the lcsr is obtained by comparing ( matching ) two different representations for the correlation function . on the one hand ,",
    "when both the momentum transfer @xmath29 and the momentum @xmath30 flowing in the @xmath26 vertex are large and negative , the main contribution to the integral comes from the light - cone region @xmath31 and can be studied using the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the time - ordered product @xmath32 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath31 of a particular contribution is governed by the twist of the relevant composite operator whose matrix element @xmath33 is related to the @xmath27 da . on the other hand , one can represent the answer in form of the dispersion integral in @xmath34 and define the nucleon contribution by the cutoff in the quark - antiquark invariant mass , the so - called interval of duality @xmath35 ( or continuum threshold ) .",
    "the main role of the interval of duality is that it does not allow large momenta @xmath36 to flow through the @xmath26-vertex ; to the lowest order @xmath37 one obtains a purely soft contribution to the form factor as a sum of terms ordered by twist of the relevant operators and hence including both the leading- and the higher - twist nucleon das .",
    "note that the contribution of higher - twist das is suppressed by powers of the continuum threshold ( or by powers of the borel parameter after applying the usual qcd sum rule machinery ) , but not by powers of @xmath4 , the reason being that soft contributions are not constrained to small transverse separations",
    ".    the `` plus '' spinor projection ( [ projectors ] ) of the correlation function ( [ cf ] ) involving the `` plus '' component of the electromagnetic current can be parametrized in terms of two invariant functions @xmath38 where @xmath17 and @xmath39 .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be calculated in qcd in terms of @xmath42 das for sufficiently large euclidean momenta @xmath43  gev@xmath1 using ope .",
    "schematically , @xmath44 a_k(q^2,p'^2\\!,x_i,\\mu_f^2 ) f_k(x_i,\\mu_f^2 ) , \\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{b}(q^2,p'^2 )   & \\!=\\ ! & \\sum_k \\int\\ ! [ dx ]",
    "b_k(q^2,p'^2\\!,x_i,\\mu_f^2 ) f_k(x_i,\\mu_f^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum goes over all existing das , @xmath45 defined in eq .",
    "( [ defdisampstar ] ) , the integration goes over quark momentum fractions and @xmath46 stands for the factorization scale .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are known to the nlo accuracy for twist - three and twist - four das  @xcite , and to leading order ( lo ) for twist - five and twist - six . in principle",
    "this expansion also contains contributions of four - particle das with an additional gluon , five - particle with two gluons or a quark - antiquark pair , etc .",
    "such contributions start at twist - four and they are not included in the present calculation because the corresponding das are very poorly known ( see , however , ref .",
    "it turns out that the coefficient functions are the same for the states with negative and positive parity , @xmath2 and the nucleon , if the definitions are chosen as explained in appendix  a. thus we are able to use the nlo expressions for the electromagnetic nucleon form factors obtained in  @xcite with trivial modifications , e.g. replacing nucleon mass @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "one difference is that , because of the larger mass , corrections of the type @xmath51 become much larger and numerically significant .",
    "for this reason in this work we use complete expressions for the lo coefficient functions from ref .",
    "@xcite rather than the corresponding expressions from ref .",
    "@xcite where the expansion in powers of @xmath51 was truncated to match the accuracy of the calculated nlo corrections .",
    "the results of the qcd calculation in euclidean region can be presented in the form of a dispersion relation @xmath52 where the ellipses indicate possible subtractions .",
    "the same correlation functions can be written in terms of physical spectral densities that contain a nucleon ( proton ) pole at @xmath53 , nucleon resonances and the continuum .",
    "the nucleon contribution is , obviously , proportional to the electroproduction form factors of interest , whereas for higher mass states one can use quark - hadron duality : @xmath54 where @xmath55  gev@xmath56 is the interval of duality ( also called continuum threshold ) . matching the two above representations and making the borel transformation that eliminates subtractions constants @xmath57 one obtains the sum rules @xmath58 the dependence on the borel parameter @xmath59 is unphysical and has to disappear in the full qcd calculation .",
    "it can be used to estimate theoretical uncertainties .",
