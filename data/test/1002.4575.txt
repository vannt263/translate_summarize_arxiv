    "in the high - energy regime of qcd , an interesting new phenomenon is expected to show up : parton saturation @xcite .",
    "saturation changes qualitatively the usual equation for the evolution of scattering cross sections with the energy of the reactions , namely the so - called balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite , by introducing nonlinearities . in turn , due to these nonlinearities , the intrinsic stochasticity of partonic evolution may start to have a sizable effect on observables .",
    "the basic nonlinear evolution equation beyond the linear bfkl equation is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite ( or , alternatively , the balitsky - jalilian marian - iancu - mclerran - weigert - leonidov - kovner ( b - jimwlk ) equations @xcite ) which however neglects the stochastic effects alluded to before , and is therefore a kind of mean - field approximation . while a formulation which would include all stochastic effects has not been fully achieved yet ( the most recent advances may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is believed that the complete evolution has a lot in common with some reaction - diffusion processes described by equations of the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) type @xcite . at the mean - field level",
    ", this analogy is a formal identity between the fkpp equation and the bk equation in the so - called diffusive limit and assuming uniformity in the transverse space ( i.e. the gluon distribution is assumed to evolve in the same way at all points of the impact - parameter space ) @xcite . beyond the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the conjecture made so far for the full problem is that at any fixed position in transverse space , the rapidity evolution of say the gluon content of a hadronic object is like the time evolution of a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion process , whose space variable would be the logarithm of the transverse size ( or momentum ) of the gluons .",
    "generally speaking , the dynamics of such systems is described by equations equivalent to stochastic extensions to the fkpp equation .",
    "( the first ideas on how to go beyond the bk equation were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the equivalence with reaction - diffusion processes was conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite ; deeper insight can be found in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , and a review in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    while this analogy is useful to find asymptotic properties of observables that involve one unique impact parameter , so far little is known about the correlations and the fluctuations of the gluon distribution between different points in transverse space , which would show up in observables that probe several points in impact - parameter space simultaneously .",
    "the correlations of the gluon number densities at different points in transverse space were computed exactly in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the systematic approximation to full qcd provided by the color dipole model @xcite , which is an accurate representation of the physics described by the bfkl equation but which does not take into account saturation effects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a calculation was done in a theory with full saturation based on a similarity with the liouville gravity .",
    "but that calculation was valid only up to distances of the order of the inverse saturation momentum .",
    "on the numerical side , on one hand , the bk equation was solved taking into account the full impact - parameter dependence @xcite , and on the other hand , the relevance of the one - dimensional stochastic fkpp equation at each fixed impact parameter was tested in toy models for qcd evolution beyond the mean - field approximation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to investigate how the saturation scale varies in impact - parameter space in the presence of both saturation and fluctuations .",
    "our method will consist in proposing a simple toy model which contains the main physical features of qcd , which may be implemented as a monte - carlo event generator and for which analytical calculations will be possible . in these respects ,",
    "our approach follows the one developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but while the latter work was purely numerical , our main results will consist in analytical expressions of the correlation of the saturation scale between two points in impact - parameter space , as a function of the distance between the points and as a function of the rapidity .",
    "the model is introduced in the next section .",
    "we then provide the derivation of the analytical expression for the correlations .",
    "finally , we check our calculations against numerical simulations of different versions of the model .",
    "the model that we introduce here is a simplified version of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the starting point is the qcd color dipole model @xcite , supplemented with some ad hoc saturation mechanism which limits the number of dipoles in any given phase space cell .",
    "the dipole model accurately represents the qcd evolution in the high - energy regime and in the limit of a large number of colors .",
    "it provides an equation for the change of the density of gluons ( represented by a set of color dipoles of different sizes and positions in the two - dimensional plane transverse to the flight axis of the hadron ) inside a hadron , when rapidity is increased . the basic process from which the evolution is built is the splitting of a dipole represented by its two endpoints @xmath2 into two dipoles @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the rate  @xcite = d^2x_2 .",
    "[ eq : dpdy ] as usually , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath7 the number of colors and @xmath8 is the rapidity . the splitting of dipoles is a linear process , which generates the bfkl equation when averages over dipole configurations ( `` events '' in an experimental language ) are taken .",
    "the rapidity @xmath8 is an effective evolution time .",
    "when the rapidity becomes very high , then gluons and thus dipoles may start to interact among themselves , which induces nonlinear terms in the evolution equations . the effect of these interactions is to tame the growth of the phase - space number density of dipoles as soon as it reaches @xmath9 , which would otherwise be exponential with the rapidity .",
    "the precise mechanism for these effects is still not known in qcd , but the main observables should be quite independent of these details .    with respect to qcd , we assume the following simplifications : _",
    "( i ) _ dipoles evolve by giving birth to one dipole of half size ( the left or the right half of the parent dipole ) , or to one dipole of double size ( in such a way that the parent be the left or right half of its offspring ) at some fixed rates , _ ( ii ) _ dipoles do not disappear in the evolution , that is to say , the parent dipoles are not removed , _ ( iii ) _ the positions and dipole sizes are discrete , and _",
    "( iv ) _ the configuration space of the dipoles is a line instead of the full two - dimensional space .",
    "we thus give up two main properties of the qcd dipole model : the collinear singularities , which cause the dipole endpoints to emit an arbitrary number of dipoles of arbitrarily small sizes , and the continuous and two - dimensional nature of the dipole sizes and positions .",
    "the first simplification is the diffusion approximation , which has been studied in the context of bfkl physics ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but which was not assumed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the second simplification was instead already assumed in  @xcite .",
    "these model simplifications may introduce some artefacts , but that we believe are under control , and many results which we will obtain within such simple models are likely to apply to qcd since they will not depend on the details .",
    "let us now specify completely the model . according to the evolution rules given above , starting from a dipole of size 1 , the sizes of all dipoles present in the system after evolution are powers of 2 .",
    "in practice , we shall only consider fractions of 1 , i.e. the sizes may be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "for each value of @xmath12 , there are @xmath13 possible values of the position @xmath14 of the center of the dipoles : @xmath15 .",
    "let us number these bins by the index @xmath16 running from the negative to the positive positions .",
    "the model may be represented as a hierarchy of bins that contain a discrete number of dipoles , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch0 ] .",
    "note that to any given impact parameter @xmath14 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponds one unique bin at each level of size .",
    "for example , at position @xmath19 , one sees the bins @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 etc ... at position @xmath23 , one sees the bins @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath24 etc ... more generally , at position @xmath25 , one sees @xmath26)$ ] , where the square brackets represent the integer part .    during the rapidity ( or time )",
    "interval @xmath27 , a dipole in the bin @xmath28 has a probability @xmath29 to give birth to a dipole in the bin @xmath30 , @xmath31 to give a dipole in the bin @xmath32 , and @xmath33 to give a dipole in the bin @xmath34 if @xmath35 is even and @xmath36 if @xmath35 is odd .",
    "note that @xmath27 may be infinitesimal ( which is generally speaking convenient for analytical calculations ) , but also finite ( which is convenient for numerical simulations ) .",
    "as for the saturation mechanism , we assume the simplest one : we veto splittings to bins which already host the number @xmath37 of dipoles .",
    "we can consider that the number density of `` gluons '' of a given size seen at one impact parameter is proportional to the number of dipoles in the corresponding bin @xmath28 .",
    "as rapidity is increased , the occupation of the bins with low values of @xmath12 gets higher until the number of objects they contain reaches @xmath37 .",
    "the subsequent filling of the bins indexed by larger values of @xmath12 ( smaller dipole sizes ) can be seen as the propagation of traveling wave fronts at each impact parameter , with possibly complicated relationships between them .",
    "the ( logarithm of the ) saturation scale @xmath38 at impact parameter @xmath14 is related to the position of the front seen there at time @xmath39 .",
    "there are several equivalent ways to define the position of the front .",
    "it could be , for example , the largest value of @xmath12 for which the number of objects becomes some given fraction of @xmath37 .",
    "( later , we will use a slightly different definition ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath40 the number of dipoles present in bin @xmath28 at time @xmath39 .",
    "then , according to the rules given above , we can write the following stochastic evolution equation : @xmath41)}(t)\\\\ + \\delta^{\\beta/2}_{(k+1,2j)}(t)+\\delta^{\\beta/2}_{(k+1,2j+1)}(t ) \\bigg ] , \\label{eq : defmodel1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the @xmath42 are drawn according to the binomial distribution =    n_(k , j)(t ) + l    ( x dt)^l(1-x dt)^n_(k , j)(t)-l . [",
    "eq : defmodel2 ] this is a rather complicated equation which we do not know how to solve except numerically .",
    "this model does not a priori look like a stochastic fkpp model .",
    "we may assume uniformity in impact parameter : this would amount to imposing the same @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively for all @xmath35 at any given @xmath12 .",
    "in this case , the model would be projected to the fkpp class , but by definition , this would wash out the fluctuations between the different impact parameters . this simplified model , that we call `` fip '' ( for `` fixed impact parameter '' , since effectively , the model is completely defined by a single impact parameter ) in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite , is nevertheless useful since it provides a benchmark to evaluate how the fluctuations between different impact parameters may alter the fkpp picture . in this paper",
    ", we will rely on ( and check again in the case of our model ) the conclusion reached in ref .",
    "@xcite that thanks to saturation , locally at each impact parameter , the full model is still well - described by a one - dimensional fkpp equation , and the fluctuations between different positions in impact - parameter space do not qualitatively change the picture .",
    "let us first apply the well - known treatment of fkpp equations to the fip case .",
    "we know that the large - rapidity realizations of the model are stochastic traveling waves , whose main features can be determined from a simple analysis of the linear part of the evolution equation . in this model ,",
    "only the number of dipoles @xmath45 in the bins say @xmath46 ( i.e. at impact parameter @xmath17 ) is relevant .",
    "the evolution equation reads instead of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolutionfip ] ) .",
    "( this may even be a more literal implementation of the fip approximation ) .",
    "but this would not make a large difference , which anyway , we would be unable to capture analytically . ]",
    "n_k(t+dt)=. [ eq : evolutionfip ] the mean - field ( or balitsky - kovchegov ) approximation to the evolution leads to the equation n_k(t+dt)= , where the @xmath45 are now real functions of @xmath12 . the linearized equation ( equivalent to the bfkl equation )",
    "is simply obtained by discarding the `` @xmath47 '' in the previous equation : n_k(t+dt)= n_k(t)+dt n_k-1(t)+dt n_k+1(t ) .",

    "the shape of the front is a decreasing exponential to the right of the saturation region , n_k(t)~n e^-_0 ( k - x(t ) ) , [ eq : exposhape ] extending to @xmath54 for large times .",
    "the corrections due to the discreteness of @xmath45 are known . taking the latter into account",
    ", the front has now a finite extension , of the order of l_0=. [ eq : l0 ] indeed , typically , it can not extend further than the point where @xmath55 , and eq .  ( [ eq : l0 ] ) then follows from eq .",

    "[ eq : vbd ] this velocity was obtained in a still deterministic ( mean - field ) approximation with appropriate cutoffs to mimic saturation and discreteness .",

[ eq : d ] these expressions are valid in the limit of large @xmath58 , i.e. for exponentially large values of @xmath37 .",
    "there exists a subclass of these models that may be reduced exactly to a collection of fkpp models .",
    "let us set @xmath59 , that is to say , authorize only splittings to smaller - size dipoles .",
    "consequently , there may not be any influence of the bins at any size level @xmath12 on the content of the bins of level less than @xmath12 ( i.e. of larger sizes ) .",
    "then , at each impact parameter , one has a fip model , i.e. a model of the one - dimensional fkpp type .",
    "however , the relationship between the different copies of fip models is not trivial , since part of the evolution is common between different impact parameters . even for @xmath60",
    ", we believe that this minimal model , consisting in considering two one - dimensional systems appropriately correlated , is a good approximation to the full model .    in our investigations , we will have in mind the latter class of models , and we will check numerically that for more general models for which @xmath60 , the results that we shall obtain are not significantly altered .",
    "our aim is to study the correlations between the point at position @xmath19 in transverse space ( left edge of the system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch0 ] ) and the one at position @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "we calculate the average of the squared difference of the positions of the front between these points , which is formally related to the two - point correlation function of ( the logarithm of ) the saturation scales , and which we deem a good estimator of the spatial fluctuations of the saturation scale . in the hierarchical model ,",
    "all bins with index @xmath12 less than or equal to @xmath63 $ ] ( the notation `` @xmath64 $ ] '' stands for the integer part ) and @xmath65 overlap both impact parameters , and thus the dipoles of size larger than @xmath66 seen at these points are exactly the same . for @xmath67 instead , the bins seen at the two points are distinct and nonoverlaping .",
    "so in particular , in our model with @xmath59 , as soon as the position of the front at one point or at the other is larger than @xmath68 , that is to say , as soon as there are of the order of @xmath37 dipoles in the bin @xmath69 , then the evolutions are completely uncorrelated at the two points in the corresponding bins .",
    "( we expect that for finite @xmath70 of order 1 , the discussion would not be qualitatively changed . )",
    "this matches to the picture that we may infer for the qcd dipole model : the dipoles at two positions in impact - parameter space separated by a distance larger than the typical saturation scales in that region evolve ( almost ) independently towards larger rapidities .",
    "note that choosing pairs of points around impact parameter 0 , one with positive impact parameter and another one with negative impact parameter , would not satisfy this property , due to the rigidity of the sizes and positions of the dipoles .",
    "indeed , these two points would decorrelate very soon in the evolution since their common ancestors necessarily sit in the bin @xmath20 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch0 ] .    as a consequence of these features of qcd reproduced in the toy model , studying two - point correlations between points in impact - parameter space as a function of their distance @xmath71 and of the time ( = rapidity )",
    "@xmath39 is equivalent to studying the time dependence of the correlations of the saturation scales of two realizations of the model whose evolutions are identical until the tip of the front reaches @xmath68 . on the average",
    ", it takes a time @xmath72 , @xmath73 being the mean velocity of the individual fronts , for the front whose tip is at @xmath74 at the beginning of the evolution to have its tip at @xmath68 .",

[ eq : ttb ] note that this is very close to assuming that the realizations are identical for @xmath75 and completely uncorrelated for @xmath76 .    from this discussion , we see that the basic input of our calculation will be the mechanism for the propagation of a fkpp front . we will review it in the next subsection , then we will proceed to the formulation of the calculation of the correlations .      in this section , we review the recent progress in the understanding of the mecanism for front propagation @xcite , which has eventually led to the formulation of a model , and from which eqs .",

    "it was proposed @xcite to replace the nonlinearities by absorptive boundaries , and to treat the evolution equation as a linear ( branching diffusion ) equation between these boundaries .",
    "there are two types of nonlinearities : _",
    "( i ) _ the saturation condition that keeps the number of particles in each bin less than or equal to @xmath37 and _ ( ii ) _ the very discreteness of this number of particles , whose effect mainly shows up in the region where @xmath77 .",
    "the position of the boundaries is adjusted in such a way that the distance between them be the size of the front  ( [ eq : l0 ] ) , namely @xmath78 , and that the large - time solution of the diffusion equation be stationary .",
    "this procedure leads to the expression of the front velocity for large @xmath37 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbd ] ) , but it does not predict the fluctuations of the position of the front .    in order to incorporate the latter , we add to this picture the possibility that there be one ( or a few ) particles randomly sent ahead of the tip of the front  @xcite , at a distance @xmath79 .",
    "we attribute to this event a probability per unit time p()d = c_1 e^-_0()d , [ eq : p ] in the continuation of the shape of the front  ( [ eq : exposhape ] ) solution in the large-@xmath39 and large-@xmath37 limit .",
    "( @xmath80 is some constant , undetermined at this stage ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we treated such fluctuations as localized extra weights of appropriate `` mass '' a unit or so to the left of the right boundary .",
    "we then computed the effect of this weight on the position of the front at large time , and found a forward shift of the position equal to r()= ( 1+c_2 ) .",
    "[ eq : r0 ] @xmath81 is another constant . at large times",
    "after a fluctuation has occurred , the front relaxes to its mean - field shape .",
    "we assumed that the relevant fluctuations are rare enough in such a way that the front has time to completely relax between two fluctuations , which turns out to be true for @xmath82 .",
    "from the two quantitative elements  ( [ eq : p ] ) and  ( [ eq : r0 ] ) , together with the solution of the stationary diffusion problem between the boundaries  ( [ eq : vbd ] ) , we may write down an effective theory for stochastic front propagation , with however two unknown parameters , namely @xmath80 and @xmath81 . while we were not able to determine @xmath80 and @xmath81 separately , it is the product @xmath83 that appears in all cumulants of the position of the front , and in particular in the correction to the velocity induced by fluctuations . assuming that the velocity of the front taking into account the fluctuations is the velocity of a mean - field front whose size is extended by @xmath84 with respect to @xmath85 ( i.e. with the substitution @xmath86 ) , we got a determination of the product @xmath83 : c_1c_2=^2^(_0 ) .",

    "<S> in order to get an estimate of the homogeneity of the distribution of matter in a fast hadron or nucleus , we compute the correlations of the saturation scales @xmath0 between different points in impact - parameter space , in some specific saturation models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these correlations are quite strong : the saturation scale is nearly uniform in domains whose sizes scale like @xmath1/q_s$ ] , which means that the density of gluons should not fluctuate significantly over regions of that typical size . </S>",
    "<S> we expect these conclusions as well as the explicit analytical expressions we obtain for the correlations to be true also for full qcd in appropriate limits . </S>"
