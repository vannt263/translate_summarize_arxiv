    "an effective theory for heavy mesons , implementing the heavy quark symmetries , has been very successful at the phenomenological level ( for reviews see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "predictions are easily obtained once the unknown effective couplings are fixed from experimental data .",
    "moreover such an effective approach can be combined with chiral symmetry for light mesons , thus giving a simple framework for implementing the known approximate symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of such an approach is the number of free parameters , which grows very rapidly if one tries to improve the calculations beyond leading order .    in order to go beyond the symmetry approach",
    ", one should be able to derive the free couplings at the meson lagrangian level from a more fundamental theory , for example directly from qcd .",
    "this is clearly a difficult task . in the long run",
    "the definitive answer will come from systematic first principle calculations , such as in lattice qcd , but at present heavy meson physical quantities such as spectra and form factors are still subject to extrapolations , even if recent improvements are impressive @xcite .",
    "moreover an alternative and intuitive way for interpolating between qcd and an effective theory would be interesting in itself , allowing us to understand better the underlying physics .",
    "obviously there is a price to pay for any simplification that may allow to calculate the parameters of an effective heavy meson theory without solving the nonperturbative qcd problem .",
    "our point of view here will be to consider a quark - meson lagrangian where transition amplitudes are represented by diagrams with heavy mesons attached to loops containing heavy and light constituent quarks .",
    "it should be kept in mind that what we study here is only a model and not full qcd .",
    "however one can hope to describe the essential part of the qcd behavior in some energy range and extract useful information from it .",
    "since the model used in the present paper is based on an effective constituent quark - meson lagrangian containing both light and heavy degrees of freedom it is constrained by the known symmetries of qcd in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "a similar model , for light quarks only , was pioneered , in the context of chirally symmetric effective theories , several years ago in @xcite .",
    "a related approach is the one based on the extended nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) models @xcite , whose generalization to include both heavy and light quarks has been studied in @xcite . in this approach path integral bosonization is used , which replaces the effective 4-quark interactions by yukawa - type couplings of heavy and light quarks with heavy meson fields .",
    "one may think of going even further and try to bosonize directly qcd , but a number of approximations are needed and one usually ends up with a non - local lagrangian .    in the following we are interested in the description of the heavy meson interactions for the doublets with spin / parity @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , i.e. s- and p - wave heavy - light mesons .",
    "these states are the object of experimental search @xcite .",
    "our aim is therefore to extend the approach of @xcite and @xcite to the description of the three spin - parity doublets mentioned above .",
    "we will consider a lagrangian at the meson - quark level , fixing the free parameters from data .",
    "this will allow us to deduce from a small number of parameters the heavy meson couplings and form factors , with a considerable reduction in the number of free parameters with respect to the effective lagrangian written in terms of meson fields only .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give an outline of the model . in section 3",
    "we compute some fundamental parameters of the model , such as mass splittings and renormalization constants .",
    "the model is used in section 4 to obtain predictions for semileptonic @xmath6 decays into negative parity and positive parity charmed resonances ; in particular we compute the relevant universal form factors that describe such decays in the @xmath7 limit and discuss the bjorken sum rule @xcite . in section 5",
    "we compute strong and radiative @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "finally in section 6 we draw our conclusions .",
    "to begin with we briefly review the description of the heavy quark field in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark is defined as follows : we indicate by @xmath8 the velocity of the hadron containing the heavy quark @xmath9 .",
    "this is almost on shell and its momentum @xmath10 can be written , introducing a residual momentum @xmath11 , as @xmath12 one extracts the dominant part @xmath13 of the heavy quark momentum by defining the new field @xmath14 @xmath15 the field @xmath16 is the large component field , satisfying the constraint @xmath17 . if the quark @xmath9 is exactly on shell , it is the only term present in the previous equation .",
    "@xmath18 , the small component field , is of the order @xmath19 and satisfies @xmath20 .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be derived by integrating out the heavy fields in the qcd generating functional @xcite , however here we only show the effect of the @xmath21 limit on the feynman rules relevant to our calculation @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark propagator in the large @xmath22 limit is : @xmath23 the @xmath24 projection operator can always be moved close to a spinor @xmath16 satisfying @xmath25 since @xmath26 commutes with the heavy quark - gluon vertex .    in our model",
    "the heavy quark propagator appears in the loops always together with light quark propagators as the heavy mesons we consider are made up of constituent heavy quark and light antiquark .",
    "the light - quark momentum @xmath11 may be taken equal to the integrated loop momentum and the heavy - quark propagator in the heavy quark limit becomes : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the difference between the quark mass and the common mass of the heavy meson doublet .      in order to implement the heavy quark symmetries in the spectrum of physical states the wave function of a heavy meson",
    "has to be independent of the heavy quark flavor and spin .",
    "it can be characterized by the total angular momentum @xmath29 of the light degrees of freedom . to each value of @xmath29",
    "corresponds a degenerate doublet of states with angular momentum @xmath30 .",
    "the mesons @xmath31 and @xmath32 form the spin - symmetry doublet corresponding to @xmath33 ( for charm for instance , they correspond to @xmath34 and @xmath0 ) .    the negative parity spin doublet @xmath35 can be represented by a @xmath36 dirac matrix @xmath37 , with one spinor index for the heavy quark and the other for the light degrees of freedom .",
    "these wave functions transform under a lorentz transformation @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the usual @xmath36 representation of the lorentz group . under a heavy quark spin transformation @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath41 satisfies @xmath43=0 $ ] to preserve the constraint @xmath44 .",

    "moreover @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath31 are annihilation operators normalized as follows : @xmath52 the formalism for higher spin states is given in @xcite",
    ". we will consider only the extension to @xmath31-waves of the system @xmath53 .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory predicts two distinct multiplets , one containing a @xmath54 and a @xmath55 degenerate state , and the other one a @xmath55 and a @xmath56 state . in matrix notations , analogous to the ones used for the negative parity states ,",
    "they are described by @xmath57\\ ] ] and @xmath58.\\ ] ] these two multiplets have @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively , where @xmath29 is conserved together with the spin @xmath61 in the infinite quark mass limit because @xmath62 .",
    "the effective quark - meson lagrangian we introduce contains two terms : @xmath63 the first term involves only the light degrees of freedom , i.e. the light quark fields @xmath64 and the pseudo - scalar @xmath65 octet of mesons @xmath66 . at the lowest order one has : @xmath67 here @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 mev and @xmath72 the term with @xmath73 is the coupling of pions to light quarks ; it will not be used in the sequel .",
    "it is a free parameter , but in njl model @xmath74 . differently from @xcite the gluon field",
    "is absent in the present description .",
    "apart from the mass term @xmath75 is chiral invariant .",
    "we can introduce a quark - meson effective lagrangian involving heavy and light quarks and heavy mesons . at lowest order",
    "we have : @xmath76+\\frac{1}{2 g^{\\prime}_3 } { \\mathrm { tr}}[{\\bar s}s ] + \\frac{1}{2 g_4 } { \\mathrm { tr } } [ { \\bar t}_\\mu t^\\mu ]   \\label{qh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the meson fields @xmath77 have been defined before , @xmath14 is the effective heavy quark field , @xmath78 are coupling constants ( to allow a comparison with previous work we follow , as far as possible , the notations of @xcite ) and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 gev ) has been introduced for dimensional reasons .",
    "lagrangian ( [ qh ] ) has heavy spin and flavor symmetry .",
    "this lagrangian comprises three terms containing respectively @xmath37 , @xmath41 and @xmath81 .  from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the @xmath82 and @xmath83 couplings could have been determined by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the experimental values of the mass differences between the mesons , belonging to the h and s multiplets respectively , and their heavy quark constituent masses .",
    "since these data are not all known , we have adopted the dynamical information coming from the njl - model as proposed in  @xcite and so we use the following modified version of ( [ qh ] ) in which we give the fields @xmath37 and @xmath41 the same coupling to the quarks :    @xmath86 + \\frac{1}{2 g_4 } { \\mathrm { tr } } [ { \\bar t}_\\mu t^\\mu ] \\label{qh1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in doing this we assume that this effective quark meson lagrangian can be justified as a remnant of a four quark interaction of the njl type by partial bosonization . @xmath37 and @xmath41 are degenerate in mass in the light - sector chirally symmetric phase . in the broken phase",
    "the mass splitting is calculable and will be computed in the next section in terms of the order parameter @xmath87 , the constituent light quark mass .",
    "the part containing the @xmath81 field can not be extracted from a bosonized njl contact interaction and requires a new coupling constant @xmath88 .",
    "an essential ingredient of the nonperturbative behavior of qcd is the suppression of large momentum flows through light - quark lines in the loops .",
    "the way this suppression is introduced in the model is crucial and is part of the definition of the model itself .",
    "one can for example include factors in the vertices which damp the loop integrals when the light - quark momentum is larger than some scale of the order of 1 gev@xcite .",
    "our model describes the interactions in terms of effective vertices between a light quark , a heavy quark and a heavy meson ; we describe the heavy quarks and heavy mesons consistently with hqet , and thus the heavy quark propagator in the loop contains the residual momentum @xmath11 which arises from the interaction with the light degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume an ultraviolet cut - off on the loop momentum of the order of @xmath89 gev , even if the heavy quark mass is larger than the cut - off .",
    "concerning the infrared behavior , the model is not confining and thus its range of validity can not be extended below energies of the order of @xmath90 . in practice",
    "one introduces an infrared cut - off @xmath91 , in order to drop the unknown confinement part of the quark interaction .",
    "we choose a proper time regularization ( a different choice is followed in @xcite ) .",
    "after continuation to the euclidean space it reads , for the light quark propagator : @xmath92 where @xmath91 and @xmath38 are infrared and ultraviolet cut - offs .",
    "this choice of regularization is consistent with the one in the second paper in @xcite . in ( [ cutoff ] ) @xmath87 is the constituent light quark mass , whose non vanishing value implies the mass splitting between the @xmath37-type and @xmath41-type multiplets .",
    "its value , as well as the values of the cutoffs @xmath91 and @xmath38 are in principle adjustable parameters . on physical grounds",
    ", we expect that @xmath93 gev , @xmath94 mev .",
    "given our choice of the cut - off prescription as in @xcite , we assume for @xmath38 the same value used there i.e. @xmath95 gev ; we observe , however , that the numerical outcome of the subsequent calculations are not strongly dependent on the value of @xmath38 .",
    "the constituent mass @xmath87 in the njl models represents the order parameter discriminating between the phases of broken and unbroken chiral symmetry and can be fixed by solving a gap equation , which gives @xmath87 as a function of the scale mass @xmath91 for given values of the other parameters . in the second paper of ref .",
    "@xcite the values @xmath96 mev and @xmath97 mev are used and we shall assume the same values . as shown there , for smaller values of @xmath91 , @xmath87 is constant ( = 300 mev ) while for much larger values of @xmath91 , it decreases and in particular it vanishes for @xmath98 mev .",

    "a most promising approach is the one based on heavy meson effective lagrangians , which incorporate the heavy quark symmetries and in addition the approximate chiral symmetry for light quarks .",
    "although with increasing data such an approach will remain the best one beyond direct qcd calculations , at this stage it is made cumbersome by the large number of parameters that have to be fixed before obtaining predictions . in this note we have presented an intermediate approach , not as rigorous and general as that of the effective meson lagrangian , but which allows for a smaller number of input parameters .",
    "we start from an effective lagrangian at the level of mesons and of constituent quarks , and we then calculate the meson transition amplitudes by evaluating loops of heavy and light quarks . in this way we can compute the isgur - wise function , the form factors @xmath202 and @xmath201 , the leptonic decay constant @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the coupling constants @xmath218 and @xmath234 relative to @xmath276 and @xmath277 processes respectively , the @xmath278 coupling relative to the @xmath279 processes .",
