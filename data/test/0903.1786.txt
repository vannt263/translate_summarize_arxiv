    "the local polaron model describes a localized electronic state which is coupled to a boson field .",
    "the local state is then assumed to be hybridized with a continuum of delocalized states and are thus not an eigenstate of the electronic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "one of the first applications of the model was the coupling of plasmons to core holes@xcite and valence holes@xcite in metals .",
    "the boson field then represents the plasmons which can be excited by the introduction of a structureless core - hole or a valence - hole which may be hybridized with metallic states .",
    "plasmon excitation spectra are typically measured using electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) where the energy loss of highly energetic electrons are measured after transmission through a metallic film .",
    "a similar application is that of deep - level spectroscopy@xcite where the boson field represents a phonon system which can be excited by the introduction of a core - hole .",
    "hybridization of the core - hole is then introduced to capture the degeneracy of the core - hole with a continuum of states with no core - hole but a high energy auger electron present .",
    "a somewhat different line of application is that of certain rare earth compounds which are known to give rise to mixed valence states@xcite .",
    "these states are characterized by an alternating valence in an otherwise periodic lattice which can result in unusual thermodynamic properties .",
    "the reason is that the difference in valence results in a difference in ionic radii and the extra valence electron thus have a strong coupling to the phonon system .",
    "the model designed to capture the effect consists of a localized @xmath0-state ( the extra valence electron ) coupled to a continuum of delocalized electrons and a phonon field coupled to the @xmath0-state .",
    "allthough , there is orders of magnitude differences between typical plasmon and phonon energies the physics in the models are very similar and only the model parameters differ .    finally the local polaron model has been applied to the problem of resonant tunneling@xcite in the context of electronic transport , and the very similar problem of hot electron femtochemistry at surfaces@xcite ( hefats ) .",
    "the idea of hefats is that an adsorbate system on a metal surface can have unoccupied electronic states which obtain a broadening due to interaction with the metallic states .",
    "if a hot electron ( an electron above the fermi level ) is generated in the metal it may interact with the unoccupied state and induce a chemical reaction on the surface . as an example we can think of a single molecule on a metal surface with one unoccupied electronic state well above the fermi level . a hot electron with an energy that matches the unoccupied orbital has the possibility of tunnelling from the metal to the molecule resulting in a transient occupation of the orbital .",
    "if the molecule was initially in an equilibrium position the electron will assert a force on the internal molecular degrees of freedom and can excite vibrational modes of the molecule before it tunnels back into the conductor .",
    "the molecule may acquire enough energy in this process to undergo a chemical reaction or a desorption event . a clever method to produce hot electrons",
    "is based on a metal - insulator - metal ( mim ) heterostructure as suggested by gadzuk@xcite . with an ideal mim device it is possible to tune hot electrons to any desired resonance of an adsorbate system and",
    "the approach thereby suggests the highly attractive possibility of performing selective chemistry at surfaces .",
    "such devices have been constructed and characterized@xcite and comprise a promising candidate for advanced hefats experiments .",
    "common to all these applications is that a linear bosonic coupling term has been assumed .",
    "it is by no means obvious that linear coupling captures the possibly complicated interaction of bosons and electrons , although it is probably often a good approximation . to examine the local polaron model beyond linear coupling",
    "we calculate the consequences of substituting the linear coupling term with a quadratic coupling term . in principle",
    "we should add the quadratic coupling on top of the linear , but this renders the model somewhat tedious to work with and the physics of quadratic coupling become hidden in complicated expressions .",
    "in contrast , having only quadratic coupling allow us to obtain inelastic scattering amplitudes very similar to those with linear coupling and the comparison is very instructive . in terms of bosonic potentials",
    ", a linear coupling term corresponds to a shift in the potential minimum whereas a quadratic coupling term corresponds to a shift in the frequency of the potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ models ] we present the local polaron model with a general coupling function and no bosonic dispersion . the electronic part is briefly reviewed and the wide band limit which is imposed in the remainder of the paper is defined .",
    "we then present the well known spectral function and inelastic scattering probabilities of the model with linear coupling and compare with a quadratically coupled model calculated in the present work .",
    "it is shown that for inelastic scattering involving a large number of bosons , quadratic coupling can give rise to much larger scattering probabilities . in section [ application ]",
    "we apply the theory to hot electron mediated excitation of the different modes of co adsorbed on cu(100 ) .",
    "the model parameters are calculated using density functional theory and the delta self - consistent field method and we find that linear coupling dominates desorption probabilities for the normal modes along the molecular axis , but vanishes for the frustrated rotations where quadratic coupling has to be taken into account . in appendix [ decoupling ] we derive a path integral representation of the newns - anderson retarded green function and show that the special properties of the wide band limit allow us to decouple bosonic and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "appendix [ linear ] and appendix [ quadratic ] present the details of the calculations leading to the spectral functions and inelastic scattering probabilities associated with linear and quadratic coupling . in appendix [ combined ] , we show how a linear transformation of creation operators makes it possible to obtain the exact green functions including both linear and quadratic coupling .",
    "the general model we are concerned with is composed of a newns - anderson type hamiltonian@xcite coupled to a dispersionless ( single frequency ) boson field through a single electronic state .",
    "a dispersionless boson field naturally corresponds to a single mode of oscillation in an adsorbate system , whereas we can think of the dispersionless model as describing an einstein band if the boson field represents a phonon system .",
    "thus it is a model of non - interacting metallic electrons @xmath1 , a localized resonant state @xmath2 , and a harmonic oscillator described by the coordinate @xmath3 or equivalently the bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 creates an electron in the state @xmath2 and @xmath8 creates an electron in the state @xmath1 .",
    "the function @xmath9 couples the resonant electron to the oscillator degrees of freedom .",
    "if one considers a hole coupled to the bosons instead of an electron , the order of @xmath7 and @xmath10 should be exchanged .",
    "it is natural to taylor expand the coupling function in the vicinity of the ground state minimum @xmath11 . including only the zeroth order term @xmath12 results in the newns - anderson model .",
    "since it is quadratic in the electronic creation and annihilation operators one could in principle formally diagonalize it .",
    "however , it is much more useful to investigate the resonant state @xmath2 ( which is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) and we are thus led to consider the retarded green function : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an electronic vacuum state and @xmath15 it is easily calculated in the energy domain using the dyson equation and the result is @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 assuming the hopping matrix elements @xmath19 to be constant , @xmath20 becomes proportional to the metal density of states .",
    "if we furthermore assume the metal density of states to be wider than the resonance energy we can write @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is the wide band limit which will be imposed in the present paper .",
    "it allow us to separate electronic and bosonic degrees of freedom in the general case and we can calculate green functions corresponding to linear and quadratic coupling exactly .    in the wide band limit the electronic retarded green function is @xmath23 and the spectral function is a lorentzian with full width at half maximum given by @xmath24 .",
    "when boson coupling terms are included ( first and second order taylor expansions of @xmath9 in ) the spectral function changes and inelastic scattering on the resonance becomes possible .",
    "suppose the resonance is initially unoccupied and the oscillator is in the state @xmath25 .",
    "the differential probability that an incoming particle ( hole or electron ) with energy @xmath26 will scatter through the resonance into a state of energy @xmath27 is given by the inelastic scattering matrix which can be expressed in terms of a two - particle green function@xcite as @xmath28 where @xmath29 the probability of transferring a given amount of energy to the bosons can thus be obtained by integrating the inelastic scattering matrix over the relevant values of @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we focus on inelastic scattering by electrons , since this is the relevant quantity in the context of hefats and eels .",
    "however , the two - particle green function also appear in the calculation of optical transition amplitudes of an adsorbed molecule@xcite and knowing @xmath30 allows one to calculate a variety of observable quantities .",
    "finally , we note that the lifetime of the electron is independent of the boson coupling in the wide band limit .",
    "the probability that the state @xmath2 is unoccupied and that the oscillator is in any state at time @xmath31 given that the state was occupied and the oscillator was in the state @xmath32 at @xmath33 is @xmath34 which is proved in appendix [ decoupling ] .",
    "and @xmath35 and the coupling function @xmath36 . the vertical distance between the two potentials at the ground state minimum is @xmath37 . ]",
    "consider the state @xmath38 with the oscillator at @xmath3 and an electron occupying the resonance .",
    "the expectation value of the hamiltonian on such a state will depend on the value of @xmath3 due to the coupling @xmath9 and if we could calculate the electronic energy for all values of @xmath3 we would obtain an excited state potential @xmath39 . doing the same for the state with no electron in the resonance @xmath40 would result in a different potential @xmath35 and the coupling function should then be given by @xmath41 which is illustrated in figure [ fig : potential ] . in the model",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the potential @xmath35 is quadratic , but in general it could have any form .",
    "the potentials @xmath42 and @xmath35 are called born - oppenheimer surfaces and are obtained by moving the oscillator adiabatically in the electronic environment .      .",
    "the strength of the coupling is proportional to the derivative of the excited state at @xmath11 . ]",
    "we now taylor expand the coupling function @xmath9 to first order and express the boson coordinate in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this gives an interaction term : @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mass and frequency of the oscillator .",
    "this model corresponds to the potentials and coupling function shown in figure [ fig : linear_pot ] .    as shown in appendix [ decoupling ] , the bosonic degrees of freedom decouple from electronic degrees of freedom in the wide band limit and the retarded green function thus becomes a product of an electronic part given by and an bosonic part .",
    "since the interacting term is linear in the oscillator coordinate the oscillator part of the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by  completing the square  or , equivalently , performing a canonical transformation which shifts the boson coordinate an amount proportional to @xmath47 : @xmath48 the retarded green function can then be calculated exactly for the @xmath25th excited state giving @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the @xmath25th laguerre polynomial and @xmath51 . in this paper @xmath52",

    "the spectral function is given by @xmath55 and for the ground state we obtain @xmath56 the spectral function is thus a sum of lorentzians of width @xmath24 and an internal spacing of @xmath46 and the amplitude of the @xmath45th peak follows a poisson distribution .",
    "it should be noted that the peaks do not represent excited states of the oscillator .",
    "it is the spectral function of the resonant electron with the oscillator in the ground state and the different peaks show that the coupling term mixes the eigenstates of the isolated oscillator . the real part of the self energy is always negative and given by @xmath57 and all physical observables are invariant to @xmath58 since linear coupling corresponds to a shifted harmonic oscillator and the direction of the shift is irrelevant .",
    "the two - particle green function and inelastic scattering matrix can also be calculated exactly@xcite and the probability that an incoming electron scatters on the resonance and excites the oscillator from the ground state to the @xmath25th excited state is @xmath59 with @xmath60 the probability of exciting the @xmath25th vibrational state thus essentially conserves the poisson distribution , but the lorentzians are replaced by the interference factor @xmath61 . the results and",
    "can also be obtained using a disentangling theorem@xcite as shown in appendix [ linear ] .      .",
    "]    we will now consider an quadratic excited state potential energy surface @xmath42 which has a minimum that coincides with the ground state minimum , but has a different harmonic evolution .",
    "the potentials and coupling function corresponding to this is shown in figure [ fig : quadratic_pot ] .",
    "alternatively we could regard this model as a second order taylor expansion of the phonon coupling function @xmath9 when the first order contribution vanishes .",
    "the interaction term in the hamiltonian becomes @xmath62 with @xmath63 in this work we will only consider bound excited state potentials of the form @xmath64 and we can then write @xmath65 in the wide band limit the electronic and bosonic degrees of freedom decouple and the boson propagator can be evaluated using a generalization of the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula@xcite . as a result",
    "the retarded green function and spectral function can be calculated exactly .",
    "the derivation is shown in appendix [ quadratic ] and gives for the ground state : @xmath66 where @xmath67 this result is valid for @xmath68 which implies that @xmath69 . again",
    ", the spectral function is a sum of lorentzians , but with the @xmath45th peak damped by a factor of @xmath70 instead of a poisson distribution .",
    "the real part of the self energy is now given by half the frequency shift .",
    "the internal spacing between the peaks is @xmath71 and we see that the quadratic coupling only mixes the oscillator ground state with the even excited states of @xmath42 .",
    "this is due to the mirror symmetry of @xmath9 which implies that only oscillator states with equal parity mix . in the quadratic case ,",
    "the effective dimensionless coupling @xmath72 is not simply given by @xmath73 as may have been anticipated , and thus the @xmath45th term in does not correspond to a @xmath45th order perturbative calculation of @xmath74 in @xmath75 .",
    "the calculation leading to the exact result is very different from the perturbative approach and we have checked that the second order taylor expansion of indeed gives the result obtained from second order perturbation theory .",
    "allthough the spectral function shows a series of peaks spaced by @xmath71 it is only possible to excite an integer number of @xmath46 through inelastic scattering .",
    "the reason is of course that the boson field is completely decoupled from the electronic states in the asymptotics of a scattering event and will thus be observed in an free oscillator eigenstate .",
    "again , the symmetry of the quadratic coupling means that transitions involving an uneven number of bosons are forbidden .",
    "the two - particle green function and inelastic scattering matrix are calculated in appendix [ quadratic ] and the probability for an incoming hot electron to excite @xmath76 quanta of oscillation when initially in the ground state is : @xmath77 with @xmath78 the structure is very similar to the case of linear coupling . with linear coupling the probability for an electron to create @xmath25 bosons are proportional to the @xmath25th order taylor expansion of @xmath79 and normalized by @xmath80 whereas in the quadratic case the probability to create @xmath76 bosons are proportional to the @xmath25th order taylor expansion of @xmath81 and normalized by @xmath82 . in the context of eels and plasmon excitations",
    ", one would now observe a series of peaks spaced by @xmath83 .",
    "if the plasma frequency is not known the spacing itself can not give clues to whether linear or quadratic coupling governs the transitions , but one could use the relative amplitude between peaks since these follow a poisson distribution if linear coupling dominates and the distribution @xmath84 if quadratic coupling dominates . if both linear and quadratic coupling is present one would observe a coupling dependent enhancement of every second peak .",
    "in a model with linear coupling , the probability of exciting @xmath76 vibrational quanta is proportional to @xmath85 whereas it is proportional to @xmath86 in a quadratic coupled model .",
    "this implies that if @xmath87 a quadratic coupling term will give rise to larger inelastic scattering probabilities than a linear term .",
    "even with @xmath88 a quadratic coupling term may have stronger effect for large @xmath25 since the expansion coefficients of @xmath89 decay slower than those of @xmath90 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : prob ] , where the probability of transferring @xmath25 vibrational quanta to the ground state is shown for linear and quadratic coupling .     through resonant inelastic scattering with linear and quadratic coupling .",
    "the parameters are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 @xmath94 . even though @xmath88 the quadratic coupling becomes dominating for large @xmath25 due to the slowly decaying expansion coefficients .",
    "one should also note the spacing between peaks which is @xmath46 for linear coupling and @xmath71 for quadratic coupling .",
    "the centers of the probability distributions are approximately shifted by @xmath95 for the linear coupling and @xmath96 for the quadratic coupling relative to the bare resonance energy @xmath37 , since this is where the binomial coefficients in and have their maxima . ]",
    "as an example of a system where the dynamics can be approximated by a local polaron model , we consider the problem of hot electron mediated energy transfer on a metal surface",
    ". such an energy transfer can lead to desorption of adsorbed molecules @xcite or induce chemical reactions which can not proceed by thermal heating.@xcite .",
    "the conceptual picture of the process is the following : hot electrons are generated in the metal by means of an mim device or a femtosecond laser .",
    "the hot electrons may then interact with a chemisorped molecule by tunneling from the metal to an unoccupied molecular state and excite vibrational states in the molecule .",
    "if enough energy is transferred to the molecule either by a single or multiple scattering events , the molecule may eventually desorp or break an internal chemical bond . as a particular example we will calculate transition probabilities for co adsorbed on cu(100 ) .    to calculate inelastic scattering probabilities within the local polaron model we need to obtain the coupling function @xmath9 . as described in section [ adiabatic",
    "] , we can fix the molecule at different positions and calculate the potential energy surfaces @xmath42 and @xmath35 at each point and @xmath41 .",
    "the model does not directly contain coulomb interactions between electrons , but these are included in the calculation of @xmath9 which thus becomes an effective coupling that is supposed to contain all the electronic interaction associated with the excited state of the molecule .",
    "the potential energies @xmath42 and @xmath35 has been obtained using the code ` gpaw`@xcite which is a real - space density functional theory ( dft ) code that uses the projector augmented wave method.@xcite in all our calculations we used the revised perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( rpbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite since this has been designed to perform well for molecules adsorbed on surfaces , and has been shown to perform better than the original pbe functional@xcite for adsorbed molecules .",
    "we set up a cu(100 ) surface consisting of three atomic layers with the top layer being relaxed .",
    "10   of vacuum has then been introduced above the slab and 0.50 monolayer of adsorbate molecules relaxed at top sites which is the preferred adsorption site .",
    "both molecules adsorb with their molecular axis perpendicular to the surface with o pointing away from the surface .",
    "we then did a normal mode analysis and mapped out the three ground state potential energy functions @xmath97 corresponding to the two normal modes that involve the perpendicular degrees of freedom and a frustrated rotation .",
    "the perpendicular modes roughly correspond to an internal stretch @xmath98 and center of mass @xmath99 .",
    "we do not include the three remaining molecular modes since one is another frustrated rotation with identical properties to the one considered , and the two frustrated translations are only weakly coupled to the resonant electron and are not expected to play a significant role in the femtochemistry . in all calculations we use a p(2x2 ) cell , sample 12 irreducible k",
    "- points in the surface plane , and use a grid spacing of 0.2  .     is a generalized coordinate representing the deviation from equilibrium .",
    "@xmath100 corresponds to a @xmath101 angular deviation from the perpendicular position . ]    to find the excited state potential energies @xmath102 corresponding to the three normal modes of interest , we have used the method of linear expansion @xmath103scf which has been published in a previous work@xcite and implemented in ` gpaw ` . in the previous publication",
    "we have tested the method against inverse photo - emission spectroscopy , and found that it performed well for molecules chemisorped on surfaces.@xcite in each step of the self consistency cycle an electron is removed from the fermi level , the density of an excited state is added to the total density , and the band energy of this state is added to the total energy . to get the band energy right we need to expand the excited state on the kohn - sham orbitals found in each iteration .",
    "the method is thus a generalization of the usual @xmath103scf where occupation numbers are changed . instead of changing occupation numbers we occupy an orbital which is not an eigenstate of the kohn - sham hamiltonian but a superposition of eigenstates in such a way that the state is as close as possible to the original molecular state . in the present case",
    "the excited state is the anti - bonding @xmath104 orbital of co. in figure [ fig : pes ] we show the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces corresponding to the frustrated rotation along with @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that the excited state potential is not exactly a quadratic potential and the parameter @xmath75 which we need to calculate transition probabilities will depend on how we fit this potential to a quadratic form",
    ". however the width of the gaussian ground state vibrational wavefunction corresponds to @xmath105  and for low lying excitations we can thus use this region of the potential which is rather flat . in fact , a closer look at the excited state potential reveals that the ground state minimum geometry actually has an unstable extremum in the excited state , but since the curvature is rather small we will simply approximate it by a constant potential . for both perpendicular modes",
    "we find that @xmath106 and quadratic coupling can thus be neglected .",
    "in contrast , due to symmetry the excited state potential energy of frustrated rotation is invariant to @xmath107 and the linear coupling term thus vanishes .",
    "we have calculated the excitation energy to @xmath108 and the resonance width is estimated from the kohn - sham projected density of states to @xmath109 . in table [ tab ] , we display the calculated parameters corresponding to the three modes .",
    ".parameters for co adsorbed on cu(100 ) .",
    "all number are @xmath110 .",
    "note that while the quadratic coupling for the two perpendicular modes are very small and thus neglectable , the linear coupling of frustrated rotation vanishes exactly due to symmetry .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that when calculating transition probabilities we should include all modes in the model , because even if the modes are not coupled directly they have an indirect coupling since they all interact with the resonance .",
    "it is possible to obtain expressions for the scattering matrix including more than one mode , but these are rather complicated to handle and for weakly coupled systems the physics can usually be extracted from three one - mode models.@xcite in figure [ fig : co_prob ] we show the calculated probabilities for a hot electron to excite the different modes of co adsorbed on cu(100 ) .",
    "the internal stretch and and frustrated rotation show transition probabilities on the same order of magnitude whereas the center of mass vibrations are very unlikely to get excited .",
    "this is in accord with calculations of the electronic friction coefficients of this system@xcite which is very closely related to the coupling function @xmath9.@xcite        the frequency of internal vibration is five times larger than both the center of mass and frustrated rotation frequencies and as previously shown@xcite the stretch mode will completely dominate the total energy transfer .",
    "thus , in a simple model where hot electron mediated desorption@xcite is reduced to calculating the probability of transferring the chemisorption energy to the adsorbate , the internal mode governs the desorption probability .",
    "nevertheless , our estimate of @xmath24 is based on the kohn - sham density of states which may give a poor description of the electronic spectral function @xmath111 .",
    "if @xmath24 is significantly smaller than our estimate , the quadratically coupled frustrated rotation will play an important role in hot electron mediated desorption for this system .",
    "we have calculated the spectral function and inelastic scattering amplitudes in a local polaron model with quadratic coupling to bosons .",
    "the probability of exciting @xmath25 bosons is found to be damped by a distribution function given by the @xmath25th taylor expansion of @xmath112 which decays much slower than the poisson distribution appearing in a linearly coupled model .",
    "hence for comparable values of linear and quadratic coupling constants , a quadratic term will dominate inelastic scattering probabilities involving a large number of bosonic excitations .    as an application we have considered the problem of hot electron mediated vibrational excitations of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces .",
    "the coupling constants were calculated from the excitation energy along the molecular normal modes using delta self - consistent field dft .",
    "it was found that quadratic coupling is important for exciting the frustrated rotations since this mode does not couple linearly due to symmetry .",
    "a major approximation in the model is the quadratic assumption for the ground state potential . in our numerical example with hefats",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : pes ] that the potentials is not exactly quadratic . for the center of mass mode",
    "the situation is even worse and a morse potential is much better suited to describe this mode .",
    "the anharmonic deviations are likely to have a significant effect on high lying excited states , but renders the model much more complicated .",
    "in fact , since the coupling to the internal stretch mode seems to govern the rate of energy transfer,@xcite one has to assume that the energy is readily redistributed to other degrees of freedom and anharmonic coupling is thus expected to play a vital role in the actual desorption process .",
    "the wide band limit has been essential in the derivation of scattering amplitudes , and we do not have the means to solve the model ( with linear or quadratic coupling ) exactly beyond this approximation .",
    "however , it would be very interesting to do perturbation theory with the general retarded green function to examine the effect of energy dependence in the electronic self energy .",
    "we are grateful to karsten jacobsen for his advice and help with the path integral representation of the newns - anderson model and to jakob schitz for helpful comments and guidance into the exciting field of hot electron femtochemistry .",
    "the center for individual nanoparticle functionality ( cinf ) is sponsored by the danish national research foundation .",
    "this work was supported by the danish center for scientific computing .",
    "the path integral representation of propagators often give a renewed insight into the underlying physics , allthough the mathematical complexity can be somewhat larger . by writing the newns - anderson retarded green function as a sum over paths , we see that each path can be understood as sequence of jumps from the resonance to the metallic band and we then have to sum over all possible time intervals between each jump . in the wide band limit",
    "the time spend in the metal band goes to zero and the electron thus spends all the time of propagation in the resonant state .",
    "the newns - anderson model is given by with @xmath113 : @xmath114 and @xmath115 the path integral representation is derived by dividing the time interval @xmath31 in @xmath116 intervals of length @xmath117 .",
    "when @xmath116 becomes sufficiently large we can take @xmath118 .",
    "we then insert @xmath119 complete sets of states @xmath32 such that the green function becomes a sum over @xmath116-fold products of matrix elements @xmath120 assuming that @xmath121 the states @xmath32 can either be @xmath2 or @xmath1 and the matrix elements @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 represent propagation in the resonance , propagation in the band and a jump from band to the resonance respectively .",
    "when we take the limit @xmath125 , becomes formally exact and the jumps between band and resonance become instantaneous .",
    "it is then most convenient to order the terms in according to the number of jumps .",
    "since the endpoints of the time interval is at the resonance , a jump into the band has to be accompanied by a jump back into the resonance and each such `` band excursion '' comes with a factor of @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the time spend in the @xmath128th excursion into band .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath129 excursions into the resonance has to be accompanied by @xmath130 resonant propagation factors @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the @xmath128th time interval in the resonant state .",
    "finally , for a given number of band excursion we have to integrate over all possible band and resonance time intervals and the retarded green function becomes @xmath133 where the delta function has been introduced to ensure that the time intervals sum to @xmath31 and the theta function has become redundant .",
    "we can use the delta function to eliminate the @xmath132 integration variables and get @xmath134 with @xmath135 by using that @xmath136 it is now possible to evaluate and recover the result . in the wide band limit , @xmath137 , which implies that the electron does not spend any time in the band and the retarded green function becomes a sum over paths which are composed of _ instantaneous _ excursions into the band .",
    "we use the notation @xmath138 to represent a position in state space and @xmath139 as a formal expression representing the sum over all paths weighted by the newns - anderson action @xmath140 .",
    "we now proceed with the full hamiltonian . introducing the bosonic coordinate @xmath3 the full retarded green function ( with the boson field in the state @xmath11 )",
    "can be written @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the newns - anderson action , @xmath143 is the free bosonic action corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath144 , and @xmath145 is the interaction part of the action corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath146",
    ". however , there is a much nicer way to handle the coupling to the boson field .",
    "one can think of the bosons as an environment influencing the paths of the resonant electron and it can be shown that the green function can be written@xcite @xmath147 with the environment time evolution operator @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the environment hamiltonian evaluated on an electronic state fixed at @xmath138 and @xmath150 denotes time ordering .",
    "thus , the price we pay in separating bosonic and electronic degrees of freedom is an explicit path dependence in the environment part of the propagator . in general",
    "it is not possible to evaluate @xmath151 on all possible paths , but in the wide band limit it is particularly simple .",

    "independent _ of the electronic path .",
    "in fact , the environment propagator becomes @xmath152 and the electronic and bosonic degrees of freedom completely decouple in the retarded green function : @xmath153 the situation is very similar for the two - particle green function : @xmath154 the resonant electron is first propagated forward in time from @xmath155 to @xmath31 and then backward in time from @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    "the interaction vanishes between the @xmath158 and @xmath159 because the resonant state is unoccupied here .",

    "we note that @xmath210 and write @xmath211 with @xmath212 the reason we have excluded the @xmath213 term is that it does not give rise to inelastic scattering and the elastic part of the scattering matrix have an additional term that we do not consider here.@xcite this expression implies that quadratic coupling can only give rise to inelastic scattering events involving an even number of vibrational quanta .",
