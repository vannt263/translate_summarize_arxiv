    "we consider the problem of reconstruction of refractive indices or dielectric constants of unknown targets placed in a homogeneous domain from blind backscattered experimental data .",
    "we work with time resolved backscattering experimental data of wave propagation for a 3-d hyperbolic coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) .",
    "our data are generated by a single location of the point source .",
    "the backscattering signal is measured on a part of a plane .",
    "we present a combination of the approximately globally convergent method of @xcite with a finite element method ( fem ) for the numerical solution of this cip . given a certain function computed by the technique of @xcite , the fem reconstructs the unknown coefficient in an explicit form . as a result , we can reconstruct refractive indices and locations of targets .",
    "in addition , we estimate their sizes .",
    "we believe that these results can be used as initial guesses for locally convergent methods in order to obtain better shapes , see , e.g. section 5.9 in @xcite , where the image obtained by the globally convergent method for transmitted experimental data was refined via a locally convergent adaptivity technique .",
    "experimental data were collected by the device which was recently built at university of north carolina at charlotte . in our experiments we image targets standing in the air .",
    "a potential application of our experiments is in imaging of explosives .",
    "note that explosives can be located in the air @xcite , e.g. improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) .",
    "the work on real data for the case when targets are hidden in a soil is ongoing .",
    "we have collected backscattering time resolved experimental data of electrical waves propagation in a non - attenuating medium .",
    "as it was pointed out in @xcite , the main difficulty of working with such data is caused by a huge mismatch between these data and ones produced by computational simulations .",
    "conventional data denoising techniques do not help in this case .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that any numerical method would successfully invert the raw data . to get the data , which would look somewhat similar with ones obtained in computational simulations , a heuristic data pre - processing procedure should be applied .",
    "the pre - processed data are used as the input for the globally convergent method .",
    "previously our research group has applied the method of @xcite to the simpler case of transmitted experimental data which were produced by a similar device ( chapter 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the backscattering real data are much harder to work with than transmitted ones since the backscattered signal is significantly weaker than the transmitted one , as well as because some unwanted signals are mixed up with the true one , see figure [ fig2]-a ) for the latter .",
    "we refer to our research in @xcite and section 6.9 of @xcite for the case of backscattering real data in 1-d . in the current paper we present results of reconstruction of the 3-d version of the method of @xcite .",
    "the approximately globally convergent method of @xcite relies on the structure of the underlying pde operator and does not use optimization techniques .",
    "each iterative step consists of solutions of two problems : the dirichlet boundary value problem for an elliptic pde and the cauchy problem for the underlying hyperbolic pde .",
    "approximate global convergence \" ( global convergence in short ) means that we use a certain reasonable approximate mathematical model .",
    "approximation is used because of one inevitably faces with substantial challenges when trying to develop globally convergent numerical methods for multidimensional cips for hyperbolic pdes with single source .",
    "it is rigorously established in the framework of this model that the method of @xcite results in obtaining some points in a small neighborhood of the exact coefficient without a priori knowledge of any point in this neighborhood , see theorem 2.9.4 in @xcite and theorem 5.1 in  @xcite .",
    "the distance between those points and the exact solution depends on the error in the data , the step size @xmath1 of a certain discretization of the pseudo - frequency interval and the computational domain @xmath2 where the inverse problem is solved ( see section [ sec:4.3 ] for definition of @xmath1 ) .",
    "a knowledge of the background medium in @xmath3 is also not required by this method .",
    "because of these theorems , convergence analysis is not presented here .",
    "a rigorous definition of the approximate global convergence property can be found in section 1.1.2 of @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we use a mild approximation , since it amounts only to the truncation of a certain asymptotic series , and it is used only on the first iterative step ( section [ sec:4.2 ] ) .",
    "the validity of this approximate model was verified computationally on both synthetic and transmitted experimental data in @xcite as well as in the current work in the case of experimental backscattering data .",
    "different imaging methods are used to compute geometrical information of targets , such as their shapes , sizes and locations , see , e.g.  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "refractive indices , which is our main interest , characterize constituent materials of targets , and they are much more difficult to compute . as to the gradient - like methods , we refer to , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "convergence of these methods is guaranteed only if the starting point of iterations is chosen to be sufficiently close to the correct solution . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in section 5.8.4 of @xcite that the gradient method failed to work for transmitted experimental data of @xcite in the case when its starting point was the background medium .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we state forward and inverse problems . in section 3",
    "we describe the experimental data and briefly outline the data pre - processing procedure . in section 4",
    "we briefly outline the method of @xcite : for reader s convenience . in section 5",
    "we describe a version of the fem which works for our case . in section 6",
    "we describe our algorithm .",
    "in section 7 we outline some details of our numerical implementation .",

    "let @xmath4 be a convex bounded domain with the boundary @xmath5 denote by @xmath6 we model the electromagnetic wave propagation in an isotropic and non - magnetic space @xmath7 with the dimensionless coefficient @xmath8 which describes the spatially distributed dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "we consider the following cauchy problem for the hyperbolic equation @xmath9@xmath10we assume that the coefficient @xmath11 of equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) is such that @xmath12,~~\\varepsilon _",

    "however , we do not assume that the number @xmath15 is small , i.e. we do not impose smallness assumptions on the unknown coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "below @xmath17 are hlder spaces , where @xmath18 is an integer and @xmath19 let @xmath20 be a part of the boundary @xmath21 later we will designate @xmath22 as the backscattering side of @xmath2 and will explain how we deal with the absence of the data at @xmath23    * coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) .",

    "@xmath27 @xmath28    the function @xmath26 in ( [ 2.5 ] ) models time dependent measurements of the wave field at the part @xmath22 of the boundary @xmath29 of the domain of interest @xmath2 . we assume below that the source position is fixed and @xmath30 .",
    "this assumption allows us to simplify the resulting integral - differential equation because @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "the assumption @xmath33 for @xmath34 means that the coefficient @xmath11 has a known constant value outside of the domain of interest @xmath35    this is a cip with single measurement data .",
    "uniqueness theorem for such cips in the multidimensional case are currently known only if the function @xmath36 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) is replaced with a function @xmath37 such that @xmath38 @xmath39 a proper example of such function @xmath40 is a narrow gaussian centered around @xmath41 , which approximates the function @xmath36 in the distribution sense .  from the physics standpoint",
    "this gaussian is equivalent to @xmath42 that uniqueness theorem can be proved by the method , which was originated in @xcite .",
    "this method is based on carleman estimates , also see , e.g. sections 1.10 , 1.11 of the book @xcite about this method .",
    "the authors believe that , because of applications , it still makes sense to develop numerical methods for this cip without completely addressing the uniqueness question .",
    "the function @xmath43 in ( [ 2.1 ] ) represents the voltage of one component of the electric field @xmath44 in our computer simulations the incident field has only one non - zero component @xmath45 .",
    "this component propagates along the @xmath46axis until it reaches the target , where it is scattered .",
    "so , we assume that in our experiment @xmath47 we now comment on five main discrepancies between our mathematical model ( [ 2.1])- ( [ 2.20 ] ) and the reality .",
    "the first discrepancy which causes the main difficulties , is the aforementioned huge mismatch between experimental data and computational simulations .",
    "the second one is that , although we realize that equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be derived from maxwell equations only in the 2-d case , we use it to model the full 3-d case .",
    "the reason is that our current receiver can measure only one of the polarization components of the scattered electric field @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , if using a more complicated mathematical model than the one of ( [ 2.1 ] ) , for example the one that includes vector scattering and thus depolarization effects on scattering , then one would need to develop a globally convergent inverse method for this case .",
    "the latter is a quite time consuming task with yet unknown outcome . * *  * * equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) was used in chapter 5 of @xcite for the case of transmitted experimental data , and accurate solutions were obtained .",
    "a partial explanation of the latter can be found in @xcite , where the maxwell s system in a non - magnetic and non - conductive medium was solved numerically in time domain .",
    "it was shown numerically in section 7.2.2 of @xcite that the component of the vector @xmath49 which was initially incident upon the medium , dominates two other components .",
    "this is true for at least a rather simple medium such as ours .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath43 in ( [ 2.1 ] ) represents the voltage of the computed component @xmath50 of the electric field , which is emitted and measured by our antennas .",
    "the third discrepancy is that the condition @xmath51 is violated on the inclusion / background interface in our experiments .",
    "the fourth discrepancy is that formally equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) is invalid for the case when metallic targets are present .",
    "on the other hand , it was demonstrated computationally in kbksnf that one can treat metallic targets as dielectrics with large dielectric constants , which we call _ appearing dielectric constant _ , @xmath52modeling metallic targets as integral parts of the unknown coefficient @xmath24 is convenient for the above application to imaging of explosives .",
    "indeed , ieds usually consist of mixtures of some dielectrics with a number of metallic parts .",
    "such targets are heterogeneous ones , and we consider three heterogeneous cases in section [ sec:8.2 ] . on the other hand , modeling metallic parts of heterogeneous targets as a separate matter than the rest of an a priori unknown background medium would result in significant additional complications of the already difficult problem with yet unknown outcome .",
    "the fifth discrepancy is that we use the incident plane wave instead of the point source in our computations .",
    "we have discovered that the plane wave case works better in image reconstructions than the point source , while the point source case is more convenient for the convergence analysis in bk , bkjiip12 .",
    "in addition , since the distance between our measurement plane and targets is much larger than the wavelength of our signal , it is reasonable to approximate the incident wave as a plane wave .",
    "thus , our results of section [ sec:8.2 ] demonstrate the well known fact that computational results are often less pessimistic than the theory , since the theory can not grasp all nuances of the reality . in summary",
    ", we believe that accurate solutions of the above cip for experimental data justify our mathematical model .",
    "figure [ fig1]-a ) is a photograph explaining the data collection .",
    "the data collection is done in a regular room , which contains office furniture , computers , etc . keeping in mind our desired application ( see introduction ) ,",
    "we intentionally did not arrange a special waveguide , which would protect our data from unwanted signals caused by reflections from various objects in the room .",
    "below @xmath53 and @xmath54 are horizontal and vertical axis respectively and the @xmath55 axis is perpendicular to the measurement plane , the positive direction of @xmath55 axis is in the direction from the target to the measurement plane .",
    "we dimensionalize our coordinates as @xmath56 where m \" stands for meter . however , we do not change notations of coordinates for brevity . hence , below , e.g. 0.05 of length actually means 5 centimeters .",
    "`` the transmitter sends the pulse into the medium which contains targets of interest . the electric wave caused by the pulse",
    "is scattered by the targets , and the backscattered signal is detected by the detector .",
    "the detected signal is recorded by the real time oscilloscope . ''",
    "two main pieces of our device are picosecond pulse generator ( figure [ fig1]-b ) ) and textronix oscilloscope ( figure [ fig1]-c ) ) .",
    "the picosecond pulse generator generates electric pulses .",
    "the duration of each pulse is 300 picoseconds .",
    "this pulse goes to the transmitter , which is a horn antenna ( source ) .",
    "the transmitter sends the pulse into the medium which contains targets of interest . the electric wave caused by the pulse",
    "is scattered by the targets , and the backscattered signal is detected by the detector .",
    "the detected signal is recorded by the real time oscilloscope .",
    "the oscilloscope produces a digitized time resolved signal with the step size in time of 10 picoseconds .",
    "the total time of measurements for one pulse is 10 nanoseconds=10@xmath57 picoseconds=10@xmath58 second .    to decrease the measurement noise ,",
    "the pulse is generated 800 times for each position of the detector , the backscattering signal is also measured 800 times and resulting signals are averaged .",
    "the detector moves in both horizontal and vertical directions covering the square @xmath59 on the measurement plane .",
    "we have chosen the step size of this movement to be 0.02 .",
    "although we can choose any step size , we found that 0.02 provides a good compromise between the precision of measurements and the total time spent on data collection .",
    "the distance between our targets and the measurement plane is approximately 0.8 with about 0.05 deviations , and the wavelength of our signal is about 0.03 .",
    "therefore , the distance between the measurement plane and our targets is of about 26 wavelengths .",
    "this is in the far field zone .",
    "the main difficulty working with experimental data is that there is a huge mismatch between these data and computationally simulated ones .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig2]-a ) depicts a sample of experimentally measured data for a wooden block at one position of the detector , see figure [ fig1]-a ) for data collection scheme . on this figure ,",
    "the direct signal is the signal going directly to the receiver .",
    "we use this direct signal as the time reference for data pre - processing .",
    "unwanted signals are due to reflections of the electric wave from several objects present in the room .",
    "figure [ fig2]-b ) presents the computationally simulated data for the same target , see section [ sec:7.1 ] for data simulations .",
    "these figures show a huge mismatch between real and computationally simulated data .",
    "therefore , data pre - processing is necessary .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details of our data pre - processing procedure .",
    "the main steps of this procedure include :    1 .",
    "_ time - zero correction_. the time - zero correction is to shift the measured data in time . so that its starting time is the same as when the incident pulse is emitted from the transmitter",
    "this is done using the direct signals from the transmitter to the detector as the time reference .",
    "2 .   _ extraction of scattered signals_. apart from the backscattered wave by the targets , our measured data also contain various types of signals , e.g.  direct signals from the horn to the detector , scattered signals from structures inside the room , etc .",
    "what we need , however , is the scattered signals by the targets only . to obtain them",
    ", we single out the scattered signals caused by the targets only and remove all unwanted signals .",
    "data propagation_. after getting the scattered signals , the next step of data pre - processing is to propagate the data closer to the targets , i.e.  to approximate the scattered wave on a plane which is much closer to the targets then the measurement plane .",
    "the distance between that propagated plane and the front surface of a target is usually between 0.02 and 0.06 ( compare with the 0.8 distance from the measurement plane ) .",
    "there are two reasons for doing this .",
    "the first one is that the method of @xcite works with the laplace transform of the function @xmath43 ( section [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "that laplace transform decays exponentially in terms of the time delay , which is proportional to the distance from the target to the measurement plane .",
    "hence , the amplitude of the laplace transformed experimental data on the measurement plane is very small and can be dominated by computational round - off error .",
    "the second reason is that this propagation procedure helps to substantially reduce the computational cost since the computational domain for the inverse problem is reduced .",
    "4 .   _ data calibration . _",
    "finally , since the amplitudes of the experimental incident and scattered waves are usually significantly different from simulations , we need to bring the former to the same level of the amplitude as the latter .",
    "this is done using a known target referred to as _ calibrating object_.    in this paper ,",
    "the result of data pre - processing is used as the measured data @xmath60 on the backscattering boundary @xmath22 of our computational domain @xmath2 for the inverse problem .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the globally convergent method for reader s convenience .",
    "we refer to sections 2.3 , 2.5 , 2.6.1 and 2.9.2 of bk as well as @xcite for details .",
    "the first step of our inverse algorithm is the laplace transform of the function @xmath61@xmath62where @xmath63 is a certain number .",
    "we assume that the number @xmath63 is sufficiently large , and we call the parameter @xmath64 _",
    "pseudo frequency_. it follows from ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) that the function @xmath65 is the solution of the following problem @xmath66@xmath67the limit ( [ 2.8 ] ) is proved in theorem 2.7.1 of @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was proven in theorem 2.7.2 of @xcite that for the function @xmath24 satisfying ( [ 2.20 ] ) there exists unique solution @xmath68 of the problem ( 2.7 ) , ( [ 2.8 ] ) for every @xmath69 such that @xmath70where @xmath71 is the solution of the problem ( 2.7 ) , ( [ 2.8 ] ) for the case @xmath72@xmath73      it follows from theorem 2.7.2 of @xcite that @xmath74 hence , we can consider the functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77substituting @xmath78 in ( [ 2.7 ] ) and keeping in mind that the source @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath79using ( [ transform ] ) we obtain @xmath80where the truncation pseudo frequency @xmath81 is a large number , which is chosen numerically , see section [ sec:8 ] for details .",
