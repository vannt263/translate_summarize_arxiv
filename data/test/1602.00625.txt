    "the temperatures become homogeneous in space rapidly and the contributions of the thermal conductivities drop out .",

    "the largest deviations of the debye model are below 100  k and less than 10  % from the direct calculations for all four metals .",
    "we therefore find that a simple model of the phonons is adequate for predicting the lattice heat capacity , in contrast to the remaining quantities we consider below which are highly sensitive to details of the phonons and their coupling to the electrons .",
    "in section  [ sec : dos ] we have shown that the electronic heat capacity , which determines the initial temperature that the hot electrons equilibrate to , is sensitive to electronic structure especially in noble metals at high @xmath0 where @xmath13-bands contribute .",

    "these changes are particularly important for gold and copper at transient electron temperatures greater than 2000  k because of the change in occupations of the @xmath13-bands situated @xmath14  ev below the fermi level in these metals .",
    "the temperature dependence of the optical response is , in particular , important for a wide range of applications beyond understanding ultrafast measurements .",
    "we show that while simple models can account for some of the qualitative features of the change in dielectric function for small changes in temperature , an electronic structure treatment is essential to quantitatively account for the complete frequency and temperature dependence , including effects such as carrier linewidth broadening and transitions between multiple non - parabolic bands .",
    "given the dearth of published temperature - dependent dielectric functions in the literature , we include detailed tables of our predictions for electron temperatures up to 8000  k , and spanning frequencies from the infrared to the ultraviolet , in the supplementary information.@xcite    this work has direct implications for analysis of experimental pump - probe studies of metal nanostructures and is the subject on ongoing work in our group .",
    "with the predicted material properties we anticipate a parameter - free description of the spectra obtained in transient absorption studies since we implicitly account for all the microscopic processes in the non - equilibrium dynamics of electrons in plasmonic metals .",

    "<S> electronic structure calculations can provide a detailed microscopic understanding of hot electron dynamics , but a parameter - free description of pump - probe measurements has not yet been possible , despite intensive research , because of the phenomenological treatment of electron - phonon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we present _ ab initio _ predictions of the electron - temperature dependent heat capacities and electron - phonon coupling coefficients of plasmonic metals . </S>",
    "<S> we find substantial differences from free - electron and semi - empirical estimates , especially in noble metals above transient electron temperatures of 2000  k , because of the previously - neglected strong dependence of electron - phonon matrix elements on electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> we also present first - principles calculations of the electron - temperature dependent dielectric response of hot electrons in plasmonic metals , including direct interband and phonon - assisted intraband transitions , facilitating complete theoretical predictions of the time - resolved optical probe signatures in ultrafast laser experiments . </S>"
