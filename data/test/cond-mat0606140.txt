    "recently we have shown that spontaneous symmetry breaking imposes a fundamental limit for the time that a large spin system can stay quantum coherent .",
    "this universal time - scale is @xmath0 , given in terms of the number of microscopic degrees of freedom @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 , and the constants of planck ( @xmath3 ) and boltzmann ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed this quantum decoherence process in terms of the exactly solvable lieb - mattis spin model , which is known to describe a symmetry broken macroscopic antiferromagnet in equilibrium . within this spin model",
    "we investigated the dynamical reduction of quantum physics to classical behavior via spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a self - contained , detailed description and explanation of the decoherence process caused by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the fact that spontaneous symmetry breaking can lead to decoherence on a time scale @xmath5 might come as a surprise . for a macroscopic body at room temperature ,",
    "@xmath6 is of order @xmath7 seconds , which is quite a short time .",
    "however , multiplying with avogadro s number @xmath8 , yields @xmath9 seconds , corresponding to a couple of centuries . given all other sources of decoherence for such a large macroscopic body , this is surely not a relevant timescale .",
    "however , the mesoscopic quantum qubits of contemporary interest are typically much smaller and the intrinsic coherence time might be reached in the near future .",
    "the counterintuitive feature of this intrinsic decoherence mechanism linked to classical equilibrium is that it starts to matter when systems become small .",
    "the many - particle qubits that motivate us to study decoherence due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are realized in a number of mesoscopic solid state systems .",
    "for instance , by engineering aluminum on a sub - micron length scale , superconducting flux qubits and cooper pair boxes can be manufactured .",
    "the flux qubit is a josephson device that can be brought into a quantum superposition of two electrical currents : a left and a right circulating current  @xcite .",
    "typically this current is carried by @xmath10 cooper pairs .",
    "a cooper pair box on the other hand is a superconducting island , containing @xmath11 electrons , which can be brought in superposition of two states with a different number of cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "magnetic many - particle qubits are for instance realized in molecular nanomagnets .",
    "molecules with large magnetic moments can be brought into a superposition of directions of magnetization .",
    "a well studied example is mn@xmath12 acetate , a molecule that contains 12 manganese atoms , coupled together to form a total spin of @xmath13 .",
    "the molecule can be brought into a superposition of states with @xmath14 and @xmath15 and coherent rabi - oscillations of the magnetization are observed  @xcite .",
    "an even larger molecule is ferritin , that contains about 4500 fe@xmath16 ions  @xcite .",
    "if the total magnetic moment of a ferritin molecule is brought into a coherent superposition , this corresponds to a superposition of @xmath17 spins . for these mesoscopic superconducting and magnetic qubits",
    "the limit in coherence due to spontaneous symmetry breaking is relevant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the general notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the thin spectrum .",
    "we illustrate these concepts by the elementary example of a harmonic crystal that breaks translational symmetry .",
    "we then show how the presence of a thin spectrum can cause decoherence .",
    "again we clarify the concept by describing a theoretical setup in which we use the crystal as a qubit .",
    "after that we switch to the more involved example of the ( non - abelian ) antiferromagnet .",
    "we first recapitulate the properties of the lieb - mattis model  @xcite and determine its symmetric and symmetry - broken eigenstates .",
    "subsequently we will use the model to determine the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking on quantum coherence . for this purpose",
    "we devise a generic gedanken experiment by coupling a two spin singlet state to the macroscopic lieb - mattis antiferromagnet .",
    "we calculate the exact time evolution of this many - body quantum superposition .",
    "our main result on decoherence follows from the evaluation of the reduced density matrix of the superposition by tracing out the thin states .",
    "finally we will then discuss what it reveals regarding spontaneous symmetry breaking in more general heisenberg - like spin hamiltonians .",
    "due to the homogeneity of space , the laws of nature possess translational invariance .",
    "this invariance implies the classical law of conservation of momentum .",
    "likewise , space being isotropic enforces rotational symmetry on the laws of physics , implying conservation of angular momentum . in quantum mechanics",
    "the power of symmetry is even greater : the translational and rotational invariance of the laws of nature taken at face value , should imply that any physical quantum object that obeys these laws , has translational and rotational symmetry .",
    "however , daily experience shows that this conclusion is nonsensical .",
    "if the universe around us and everything in it would be translationally and rotationally invariant , it would look the same at all places and in all directions : we would be surrounded by a `` quantum mist '' , while human observers should be dissolved in this quantum fog as well .",
    "however , in the real world translational and rotational symmetry are manifestly broken .",
    "the fundamental difference between quantum and classical physics lies in the role of symmetry . dealing with an exact quantum mechanical eigenstate , all configurations equivalent by symmetry should have exactly the same status in principle , while in a classical state one of them can be singled out . in the example above , given that space is translationally invariant , a quantum object should be in an eigenstate of total momentum , being spread out with equal probability over all of space . in the classical limit",
    "however it takes a definite position .",
    "the explanation of this ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ' as a ramification of the singular nature of the thermodynamic limit is one of the central achievements of quantum condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "one imagines a symmetry breaking ` order parameter field ' @xmath18 ( e.g. , a potential singling out a specific position in space ) . upon sending @xmath18 to zero before taking the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath19 ) one finds the exact quantum groundstate respecting the symmetry .",
    "however , taking the opposite order of limits one finds that the classical state becomes fact .",
    "although the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking was originally introduced in the context of quantum magnetism in solid state physics  @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking is a general phenomenon , that is just as relevant in other fields , including elementary particle physics and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider how spontaneous symmetry breaking arises in a crystalline lattice to continue in the next section with antiferromagnets . consider the textbook example of a harmonic crystal , with the hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 labels all @xmath1 atoms in the lattice , which have mass @xmath22 , momentum @xmath23 and position @xmath24 .",
    "the harmonic potential between neighboring atoms is parameterized by @xmath25 ; it turns out that the results on spontaneous symmetry breaking that follow are equally valid for an - harmonic potentials .",
    "let us first identify the collective dynamics which describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this short - ranged microscopic hamiltonian",
    ".    in the standard treatment of the quantum crystal one begins by introducing new coordinates , which are the displacements of atoms from their equilibrium position .",
    "then , after a fourier transform the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are easily found .",
    "we take a slightly longer route by introducing bosonic phonon operators from the very beginning and diagonalizing the quadratic part of the hamiltonian by performing a bogoliubov transformation at the end . in doing",
    "so we do not have to introduce any equilibrium position of the atoms .",
    "instead we can keep track of the center of mass motion of the crystal as a whole , and this brings to the fore the thin spectrum in a natural manner .",
    "moreover we can use the exact same procedure in the next section to find the collective order parameter dynamics for antiferromagnets .    the momentum and position operators are expressed in terms of bosonic operators as @xmath26 so that the commutation relation @xmath27",
    "= i \\hbar \\delta_{j , j'}$ ] is fulfilled .",
    "we choose @xmath28 so that the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath29 and after a fourier transformation @xmath30 , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the lattice constant .",
    "this hamiltonian is still not diagonal , since the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 create and annihilate two bosons at the same time .",
    "we get rid of these terms by a bogoliubov transformation ( see appendix ) .",
    "after this the hamiltonian in terms of transformed boson operators @xmath36 is @xmath37\\nonumber \\\\   & = & 2 \\hbar { \\sqrt \\frac{\\kappa}{m } } \\sum_k \\sin |ka/2| \\left [ n_k + \\frac{1}{2 } \\right ] , \\label{eq : hbeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath38 .    this result seems to coincide with the textbook hamiltonian which we would have obtained if we had followed the conventional route of fourier transforming the hamiltonian for the displacements , and then quantizing it .",
    "however , the bogoliubov transformation has the advantage that it brings to the fore a rather subtle point .",
    "when @xmath39 the excitation energy @xmath40 and the two parameters in the bogoliubov transformation diverge : @xmath41 and @xmath42 . precisely at @xmath43",
    "the canonical transformation is no longer well defined .",
    "we therefore should investigate the bosonic terms in the hamiltonian with @xmath43 separately .",
    "this zero momentum part of the hamiltonian describes the obvious fact that the crystal as a whole carries a kinetic energy associated with the combined mass of all of its constituents , and is given by @xmath44\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 so that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total momentum of the entire system , or equivalently , its center of mass momentum .",
    "when @xmath1 is large , this hamiltonian has states that are very low in energy .",
    "these states in fact form the thin spectrum of the harmonic crystal .",
    "we call this part of the spectrum _ thin _ because it contains so few states of such low energy that its contribution to the free energy in the thermodynamic limit completely disappears ( see appendix ) . in turn",
    ", this implies that these thin spectrum states do not contribute to any thermodynamically measurable quantities such as for instance the specific heat of the crystal .",
    "their effect on the properties of the crystal is thus increasingly subtle , but its existence can nonetheless have profound consequences . in classical systems",
    "this thin spectrum is absent : it is quantum mechanics that generates it . about a decade ago the deep meaning of the thin spectrum for interacting quantum systems became clear and consequently its explicit mathematical structure was determined  @xcite .",
    "the groundstate of the hamiltonian at @xmath48 , which governs the collective behavior of the crystal as a whole , obviously has total momentum zero .",
    "it thus has no uncertainty in total momentum and maximum uncertainty in total position : translational symmetry is unbroken .",
    "symmetry breaking can occur if we add to the hamiltonian of equation a symmetry breaking field of the form @xmath49 , where the center of mass coordinate is @xmath50 .",
    "this yields a harmonic oscillator equation for the collective position coordinate .",
    "its well known groundstate wavefunction is @xmath51 this state describes a wave - packet for the center of mass coordinate in real space , which of course corresponds to an equivalent superposition of total momentum states : the symmetry breaking field @xmath18 couples the different thin spectrum states of the crystal . for a vanishing symmetry breaking field @xmath18 and finite number of atoms we have @xmath52 and the collective coordinate is completely delocalized , as before : @xmath53 . but",
    "taking the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath54 ) _ in presence of a finite symmetry breaking field _ gives @xmath55 and the center of mass position becomes completely localized in the center of the potential well ( @xmath56 ) , even if at the end the symmetry breaking field is sent to zero . as we already pointed out",
    ", such a singular limit characterizes spontaneous symmetry breaking ; in this particular case the translational symmetry of the crystal as a whole is spontaneously broken .",
    "the occurrence of a thin spectrum which consists of the states associated with the quantum mechanics of the macroscopic body as a whole is a universal notion .",
    "whenever a system exhibits a continuous symmetry which is broken in the classically realized , macroscopic state , then consequently there must be a spectrum of states associated with the symmetry - restoring fluctuations of the orderparameter as a whole .",
    "the universality of this notion is guaranteed by the goldstone protection which holds for the low energy excitations at @xmath39 in any system with a broken continuous symmetry .",
    "the smallness of the energy spacing within the thin spectrum warrants the orderparameter dynamics of macroscopic bodies to take place on a time scale much larger than anything observable .      to study the effect of the thin spectrum on the coherence of many particle qubits ,",
    "let us first investigate the dynamics of such a qubit in the most general terms . consider a many particle system that is large enough to display a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry , but small enough to be used as a qubit .",
    "this qubit will then have a thin spectrum which we can label by the quantum number @xmath57 . at the same time",
    "the system must have two accessible quantum states that can be used as the qubit states , and which can be labeled by the quantum number @xmath22 . because we have no experimental control over the thin spectrum states",
    ", we will have to start out the experiment with a thermal mixture of those states : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the density matrix , @xmath60 is the energy of the state @xmath61 and where , by definition , the partition function is @xmath62 and @xmath63 . to begin using this qubit in a quantum computation we will typically have to prepare it in some coherent superposition of the states in the two level system . to do this",
    "we apply a rotation that takes the state @xmath64 into the state @xmath65 for all values of @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting density matrix then is given by @xmath66 if we know the hamiltonian @xmath67 which governs the dynamics of the qubit , then we can follow the time evolution of this density operator by applying the time evolution operator @xmath68 .",
    "we then find for the density matrix at @xmath69 @xmath70   \\right ) , \\label{eq : one}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 denotes the hermitian conjugate of its preceding term .",
    "experimentally the thin spectrum is as good as unobservable because of its extremely low energy and its vanishing thermodynamic weight ( see appendix ) .",
    "we therefore have to trace these states out of the density matrix .",
    "this will yield a reduced ( observable ) density matrix , defined by @xmath72 where the trace is over thin spectrum states labeled by @xmath21 and @xmath73 . performing the trace ,",
    "we find the following reduced density matrix in the basis of the states @xmath74 @xmath75^{\\rm * } & 1 \\end{array }   \\right ] , \\label{eq : three}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the off - diagonal matrix element is defined as @xmath76 if this off - diagonal matrix element vanishes at some time , then the qubit will have decohered at that time , due to the presence of the thin spectrum",
    ". in general @xmath77 will not be zero , and this shift in energy corresponds to a phase shift of the thin spectrum states .",
    "these phases will typically interfere destructively , lowering @xmath78 and leading to dephasing and decoherence .",
    "the timescale for this decoherence process is set by the inverse of the involved energy scale , and will therefore be proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "for this dephasing to occur however , it is necessary that a finite number of thin spectrum states participates in the dynamics of decoherence .",
    "how many states do contribute to the process is governed by the boltzmann factor @xmath80 , which exponentially suppresses states of energy higher than @xmath81 with @xmath82 the typical level spacing of the thin spectrum states .",
    "putting these arguments together , one finds that the characteristic timescale on which @xmath78 will vanish should be proportional to @xmath83 in the following sections we will calculate @xmath5 explicitly for a number of realizations of the many particle qubit .",
    "we will see that in the generic situation @xmath84 so that we find @xmath85 which is our main result .",
    "as a first example of the influence of the thin spectrum on coherence , let us try to employ the harmonic crystal discussed in the introduction as a qubit .",
    "in order to do so we will have to define a set of two states that are to be used as the calculational states of the qubit . a simple choice for such a set could be to use the presence or absence of an interstitial excitation .",
    "this leads to the definition of the state @xmath86 describing the crystal with @xmath1 atoms , and the state @xmath87 which has one extra interstitial atom , and is described by the same model , but with @xmath88 atoms in the lattice .",
    "the thin spectrum is exactly as described in  , so that the energy can be defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass of an atom , @xmath57 labels states with different total momentum ( which make up the thin spectrum ) , and @xmath91 is the chemical potential associated with adding an extra atom to the lattice .",
    "we are now in the position to simply substitute this information into the general expression for the off - diagonal matrix element of the reduced density matrix  , yielding @xmath92 the constant phase factor @xmath93 does not contribute to the decoherence process , but the terms depending on @xmath57 introduce phase shifts into the dynamics of the system , which lead to the disappearance of @xmath78 over time .",
    "upon introduction of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , a straightforward evaluation of the sum over thin spectrum states yields @xmath5 , defined as the half time for @xmath96 @xmath97 by using the crystal as a qubit in this way we have assumed that we can just ignore the symmetry breaking field as soon as the crystal has been localized in space at some time in the past .",
    "in general this may not be true , because the thermodynamic limit and the limit of disappearing localization field do not commute .",
    "we should therefore also consider the situation in the presence of a small but finite symmetry breaking field @xmath18 . in that case",
    "the energies of the system will be given by @xmath98 which will again lead to a phase factor which is constant in @xmath57 , and a sum over phases which can be written as multiples of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the summation over thin spectrum states will thus again yield the coherence time @xmath101      the interstitial excitation used in the previous section to characterize the qubit state of the harmonic crystal is a very rough excitation to use for that purpose .",
    "the extra atom in the crystal will immediately affect the whole lattice structure , and thus couple to many phonon - excitations .",
    "on top of that it also automatically increases the mass of the crystal as a whole , and thereby influences the thin spectrum directly .",
    "because of this direct alteration of the crystal properties , serious decoherence effects are to be expected . in constructing a qubit using the quantum crystal",
    "it is therefore better to look for a more silent excitation .",
    "these silent excitations are naturally found in the long wavelength goldstone modes of the crystal , i.e. the low energy phonons .    to see what is the effect on the thin spectrum of having phonons present , let s consider the general anharmonic term @xmath102 which supplements the hamiltonian  , and introduces phonon - phonon interactions in its dynamics .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath103 is @xmath104^z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 the lattice constant . from this expression",
    "it is immediately clear that for all values of @xmath105 the @xmath48 part of @xmath103 will vanish .",
    "this is of course just a manifestation of the goldstone protection of the long wavelength phonon modes , but it implies that the presence of phonons can not alter the form of the thin spectrum part of the hamiltonian given by  .",
    "the addition of a symmetry breaking field will not modify that conclusion , because the energies of the collective model in presence of a localization field only depend on the total mass of the crystal and the size of the symmetry breaking field .",
    "the phonons do not influence the mass of the quantum crystal , and thus we find that @xmath106 both for zero and finite symmetry breaking field @xmath18 .",
    "because the phonons do not influence the thin spectrum at all , there will also be no induced decoherence of a superposition of different phonon states by the thin spectrum . in this case",
    "thus @xmath107 of course the superposition of phonon states will be influenced by all the other sources of decoherence that are present in the crystal , but it is protected from the decohering effects of the thin spectrum by the fact that phonons do not influence the properties of the crystal as a whole .    the fact that the goldstone modes of the crystal supply an excitation that is protected from all decohering effects of the thin spectrum is due to the fact that we only considered translation symmetry breaking of the crystal _ as a whole_. within it , there is still translation invariance of the atoms .",
    "this pathology that is due to the periodic boundary conditations that we implicitely assumed .",
    "a coupling between the thin spectrum and the goldstone modes can appear as soon as this internal symmetry is broken as well which is the generic situation .",
    "in fact we will show in the next section that even in the most silent non - abelian model that one can think of , i.e. the antiferromagnetic lieb - mattis model , this pathology will disappear .",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the antiferromagnetic lieb - mattis model .",
    "the reason for considering the rather particular , long ranged lieb - mattis model is that for a broad class of heisenberg models with short - ranged interactions it constitutes the effective hamiltonian for the thin states .",
    "similar collective models underly the breaking of other continuous symmetries , such as for instance gauge symmetry in a superconductor . in that case",
    "the collective hamiltonian turns out to be very similar to the lieb - mattis hamiltonian as far as the structure of the thin spectrum and the composition of the wavefunction of the symmetry broken state are concerned . to explicitly show how the lieb - mattis model is arises from a heisenberg model ,",
    "let us consider an antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice with isotropic nearest neighbor interactions between quantum spins of size @xmath108 .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath109 where @xmath110 labels all the spins on the @xmath111 sublattice , and the @xmath112 are the vectors connecting site @xmath110 to its neighbors on sublattice b. the generalization to other types of interactions and even other types of lattices is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "the magnon spectrum of this hamiltonian can be found within linear spin wave theory .",
    "one approximates the spin operators with holstein - primakoff bosons as @xmath113 to quadratic order in the boson operators the hamiltonian becomes , after a fourier transformation @xmath114 where @xmath105 is the coordination number of the lattice , @xmath1 the number of lattice sites and @xmath115 .",
    "the last two terms in this expression can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation ( see appendix ) . again",
    "the important point is that the bogoliubov transformation is singular at @xmath116 and @xmath117 , as in both cases @xmath118 .",
    "we therefore treat these two @xmath119-points separately . turning back to the notation in terms of spins , using that the fourier transform of our hamiltonian is @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "we find that the singular parts of the spectrum reduce exactly to the lieb - mattis hamiltonian @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the total spins of each sublattice , and @xmath125 is the _ total _ spin of the system . from here on we will focus entirely on this collective hamiltonian , as it is the only part of the heisenberg - like hamiltonians that is relevant for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet as a whole .",
    "notice that the _ internal _ ordering of the individual spins within the antiferromagnet can be destroyed by fluctuations of finite wavelength that we do not consider in this collective , long ranged model .",
    "we assign to the hamiltonian @xmath126 the superscript @xmath127 because this hamiltonian , as we will show below , describes the symmetric ( symmetry unbroken ) state of the antiferromagnet . in @xmath126",
    "each spin on the @xmath111 sublattice interacts with all spins on the @xmath18 sublattice and vice versa , thus creating infinite range interactions .",
    "the energies of the hamiltonian are trivially identified as @xmath128 $ ] and the corresponding eigenfunctions are labeled by their quantum numbers @xmath129 . here the @xmath105-component of the total spin @xmath125 is denoted by @xmath90 .",
    "clearly the ground state of @xmath126 is a singlet of total spin : the state with lowest energy has @xmath130 .",
    "in fact there is an exact proof that the groundstate of any finite spin system of this sort is a total spin zero ( @xmath130 ) singlet  @xcite .",
    "notice that all states which differ only in @xmath90 are degenerate . for simplicity ( and without loss of generality ) we henceforth take the quantum number @xmath90 to be zero @xcite .",
    "the groundstate singlet @xmath131 , with both @xmath132 and @xmath133 maximal and @xmath134 is separated by energies of order @xmath135 from states with higher @xmath136 .",
    "the set of these extremely low energy states that only differ in their total spin quantum number forms the thin spectrum  @xcite .",
    "since   is contained in   as its @xmath137 and @xmath138 components , and since the thin spectrum of the lieb - mattis model is formed by the @xmath139 component , exactly the same thin spectrum must govern the collective dynamics of other antiferromagnets with short - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "there are also excitations in   that can be created by lowering @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "this costs an energy of order @xmath140 , and it can easily be shown that these excitations correspond to the elementary excitations , the magnons , of the lieb - mattis system  @xcite .",
    "because of the extremely long ranged interactions the magnons are gapped and dispersionless",
    ".      having defined the lieb - mattis model in its symmetric form , we now review how to explicitly break its non - abelian su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry",
    ". we will show that in the thermodynamic limit the symmetry breaking occurs spontaneously  @xcite . since the groundstate of @xmath126 is a singlet of total spin , this state is orthogonal to the nel state , which is the ground state of a classical antiferromagnet .",
    "we should stress here that there is a marked difference between ferro- and antiferromagnets .",
    "even if spontaneous symmetry breaking is very often discussed with the example of a ferromagnet at hand , the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a ferromagnet is not the generic situation for an interacting quantum system .",
    "the reason is that the total magnetization ( pointing along , e.g. , the z - axis ) , which is the order parameter of a ferromagnet , commutes with the hamiltonian : it is nothing but the projection of the total spin along that axis , @xmath141 .",
    "so the situation arises that the orderparameter is a constant of motion , which is a pathology of the ferromagnet .",
    "this same pathology leads to the absence of an interesting thin spectrum , because in the ferromagnet states with different @xmath141 are strictly degenerate .",
    "quantum systems in general , however , have non - trivial thin spectra .",
    "refocusing on antiferromagnets , we need to proof that the nel state is a stable groundstate in the thermodynamic limit . in order to do so",

    "here we restricted ourselves to the zero - magnon subspace , where @xmath152 ( hence the subscript @xmath153 in @xmath151 ) .",
    "the generalization to systems with a finite number of magnons will be straightforward .    in the continuum limit where @xmath1 is large and @xmath154 ,",
    "the matrix elements due to the symmetry breaking field simplify considerably .",

    "however , in the present situation we have to meet the boundary condition that @xmath166 or , equivalently , that @xmath167 if @xmath168 .",
    "so @xmath148 has to vanish at the origin .",
    "this boundary condition is trivially met by eigenfunctions that are odd and have a node at @xmath130 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : harmonic ] .",
    "thus solutions to the schrdinger s equation   are harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions of order @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is an odd positive integer . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave ] the groundstate wavefunction in the continuum limit is compared with the exact wavefunction for large @xmath1 .",
    "it makes clear that the continuum approximation is very good one .",
    "spins ) and the nel wavefunction in the continuum limit ( a harmonic oscillator eigenstate ) .",
    "the overlap of the nel state with the different total spin states is shown as a function of the total spin quantum number .",
    "the parameters are @xmath169 and the symmetry breaking field is @xmath170 .",
    "the wavefunctions are rescaled such that the maximum of the harminic oscillator wavefunction is unity . ]",
    "let us consider the energy spectrum in eq .   in more detail .",
    "clearly if @xmath18 is zero we recover the groundstate energy @xmath150 of the symmetric case that we discussed before .",
    "however , if there is a finite staggered field @xmath18 , there is a gain in groundstate energy proportional to @xmath171 , which reveals that the energy spectrum in eq .",
    "is the one of a nel state .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by directly calculating the orderparameter ( see appendix ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter ] . apparently ,",
    "for the symmetry broken nel state to be stable , the symmetry breaking field can be exceedingly small , as long as @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "in other words : in the thermodynamic limit the spin rotation symmetry of @xmath126 can be _ spontaneously _ broken by an infinitesimal field @xmath18 .",
    "putting it in a more formal manner : spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to the singular limit @xmath172 this in fact defines spontaneous symmetry breaking , just as it did in the case of the quantum crystal .",
    "that for the lieb - mattis hamiltonian this limit is singular is directly clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter ] .      in the symmetry broken nel state the excitations labeled by @xmath57 act as a new thin spectrum with excitation energies that are multiples of @xmath173 .",
    "the magnon excitation energy is still of order @xmath140 .",
    "we now repeat the analysis above for a nel state with @xmath22 magnons ( by setting @xmath174 and using @xmath175 instead of @xmath158 ) . in this case",
    "the energy spectrum becomes @xmath176 see fig .",
    "[ fig : thin ] .",
    "note that as we stated before , there is a subtle effect of the magnons on the thin states : @xmath22 magnons cause a change in energy of the thin spectrum of the order of @xmath177 .",
    "this effect will turn out to be essential for the decoherence mechanism that we will discuss in the following section .    physically the change in energy of the thin states due to the presence of a magnon",
    "can easily be understood .",
    "if there are @xmath22 magnons present in the antiferromagnet , then the order parameter of the total system is reduced by @xmath22 .",
    "since the thin spectrum describes the global excitations of the order parameter , its energy is proportional to the order parameter itself .",
    "the ratio of the nel order parameter of the excited state with @xmath22 magnons and the one of the groundstate with a fully developed order parameter is @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , when there are @xmath22 magnons present , the relative change of the orderparameter is @xmath177 and the change in energy of the thin states is therefore of the order @xmath179 which explains the last term in expression  ( [ eq : enm ] ) .",
    "using the many - body lieb - mattis model with @xmath1 spins and @xmath180 , we now study the coherence of the antiferromagnet when it is used as a qubit .",
    "again there are many ways in which one can define a two - level system to be used as the qubit states .",
    "the best possible choice in this case is provided by the gapped and dispersionless magnons : we use as a qubit ( or cat - state ) the superposition of a perfectly ordered antiferromagnet and the state of the antiferromagnet with one magnon on each sublattice . due to the long - range nature of the interaction in the lieb - mattis model the gapped magnons themselves",
    "are not damped and as such do not decay or decohere .",
    "also , in analogy to the quantum crystal we expect the magnons or goldstone modes of the antiferromagnet to influence the thin spectrum as little as possible .",
    "a magnon has an energy @xmath140 , which we assume is the energy scale that is available to the ( thought-)experimentalist to prepare , manipulate and read out the qubit  ) , which considerably simplifies the calculations without loss of generality . ]",
    ".     starts interacting with a @xmath1-spin lieb - mattis magnet , thus forming at @xmath69 a many - body qubit made out of @xmath181 spin .",
    "quantum coherence is preserved at all times , since in this semi - classical approximation the thin spectrum is neglected . ]    with the exact expressions for all eigenstates and energies of both the symmetric and the symmetry broken hamiltonian at hand , we are in the position to set up the initial state for our many - particle qubit . instead of simply assuming that we are in a previously prepared superposition of states with zero and two magnons , we will explicitly construct this initial state .",
    "this can be done by coupling at time @xmath182 a two spin singlet to the symmetry broken @xmath1-spin lieb - mattis system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qubit ] . from this the desired superposition results .",
    "so for times @xmath183 , the lieb - mattis antiferromagnet is completely decoupled from the two spin singlet and the total wavefunction is thus the direct product of the wavefunctions of the @xmath1-spin magnet and the two - spin singlet state : latexmath:[\\ ] ] which reduces to the classically expected order parameter in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "note that in this expression it is immediately clear that the limit of vanishing symmetry breaking field does not commute with the limit of infinitely many spins : they form a singular limit .",
