    "the completeness of a quasar survey should properly be specified by the survey selection function , @xmath8 , which gives the probability of detecting a quasar as a function of absolute magnitude , redshift and spectral energy distribution @xmath9 .",
    "the number of detected quasars in each cell of @xmath10 space is divided by @xmath8 to give the number of quasars that could be found .",
    "summation over all cells gives the total population of quasars within the survey limits . in practice",
    ", @xmath8 can not usually be determined reliably , and many cells may be empty or too poorly occupied for reliable estimates of the true number .    in this paper , we apply a statistical method to estimating the completeness of quasar surveys .",
    "it requires that an area of sky has been covered by two or more , preferably different , selection techniques .",
    "it does not require @xmath8 .",
    "we adopt @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the method for estimating the completeness of a quasar survey involves the comparison of the number of detected quasars and an estimate of the total population .",
    "the total population is estimated using the method devised by @xcite for estimating scanning efficiencies in the detection of events in particle physics .",
    "the use of the derenzo & hildebrand ( subsequently dh ) method here is appropriate because in both applications the size of a total set of events is estimated from repeated scans of the set , with each scan yielding only a subset . in dh ,",
    "the total number of particle events is estimated from repeated scans of film records ; in this paper , the total number of quasar events is estimated from repeated scans ( surveys ) of an area of sky .    in a similar application to ours ,",
    "harwit & hildebrand ( 1986 ) used the dh method to estimate the remaining number of observational phenomena still to be discovered in astronomy .",
    "four kinds of scans were defined according to their usage of ( i ) optical continuum methods ; ( ii ) radio techniques ; ( iii ) optical spectroscopy ; and ( iv ) all other techniques to discover astronomical phenomena .    as a demonstration ,",
    "we have applied the method to two samples of objects derived from a known parent population .",
    "we show that the total number of objects in the parent population is satisfactorily recovered .",
    "the net visibility , @xmath16 , of an object is defined to be the probability that it will be found by an _ average _",
    "detection technique .",
    "it takes values in the range 0 ( invisible ) to 1 ( unmissable ) .",
    "note that the net visibility depends on both the intrinsic characteristics of the object and the perceptiveness of the detection techniques .",
    "the net visibility function , @xmath17 , is defined such that @xmath18 is the number of objects with net visibilities in the range @xmath16 to @xmath19 .",
    "the total number of objects is then    @xmath20    note that @xmath17 is an _ average _ of visibility functions for the individual techniques ( derenzo & hildebrand 1969 ) . the existence of visibilities and visibility functions is an assumption of the method .",
    "see the appendix for a formal derivation of @xmath17 and the above result for @xmath21 .",
    "if all objects had equal prior probability of being detected then @xmath17 would be a @xmath22-function at the average detection probability .",
    "in general , however , @xmath17 is an unknown function that must be estimated .",
    "consider a population that is surveyed using several techniques , preferably different but not necessarily .",
    "suppose , for example , that there are three techniques .",
    "a first technique ( * a * ) detects @xmath23 objects , another technique ( * b * ) detects @xmath24 objects , and a third technique ( * c * ) detects @xmath25 objects .",
    "a particular object may be detected by more than one technique .",
    "the average number of objects detected by one application of the average technique , @xmath26 $ ] , is the average number detected by the three techniques    @xmath27 = [ a+b+c]/3\\ ] ]    to determine the average number of new objects detected by the second application of the average technique , we take the techniques in pairs . a new object is detected if it is seen by one technique but not by the other .",
    "thus ,    @xmath28 = [ ab + ac + ba + bc + ca + cb]/6\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 denotes the number of objects detected by technique * a * but missed by technique * b * , and so forth .",
    "similarly , the average number of new objects found by the third application of the average technique is    @xmath30 = [ abc + bac + cab]/3\\ ] ]    in general , the distributions of undetected objects after one , two and @xmath31 surveys are respectively @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "hence the number of new objects found in the @xmath35 survey using the average technique will be    @xmath36 = \\int_{0}^{1 } v f(v ) ( 1-v)^{i-1 } { \\mathrm d } v\\ ] ]    the collection of values @xmath26 , m[2 ] , \\ldots , m[n]$ ] can then be used to evaluate @xmath17 , if we assume for @xmath17 an expression with not more than @xmath37 parameters , where @xmath37 is the number of surveys .",
    "@xcite argue that , in general , the total number of objects , @xmath38 , derived from @xmath17 will be approximately the same for any smooth trial function , @xmath17 , whose @xmath39 parameters @xmath40 are adjusted to give satisfactory fits to the values of @xmath41 $ ] .",

    "where @xmath44 , this expression can be rewritten as    @xmath45    this shows that , when there are only two surveying techniques , the estimated lower limit for @xmath21 depends on the number of objects that both techniques have in common @xmath46 .",
    "when the total number of objects detected by both techniques is very large but the number of objects in common is relatively small , this dependency will lead to a very large estimate of @xmath21 . from an analysis of the behaviour of the above expression in these circumstances",
    ", we have found that unreliable estimates of @xmath21 tend to be given when @xmath47 .",
    "we therefore recommend that the method is applied only to data sets in which this ratio is @xmath48 .",
    "there are no such discontinuities for higher values of @xmath37 .    as a demonstration of the method",
    ", we consider the optical survey by tritton & morton ( 1984 ) .",
    "they identified all objects in a region of 0.31 deg@xmath49 , finding 747 ordinary stars , 3 white dwarfs , 4 quasars , and 143 galaxies .",
    "we take the 601 stars found with @xmath50 as a complete sample and then isolate two subsets by different selection criteria : ( i ) 379 stars with @xmath51 ; ( ii ) 312 stars with an objective - prism classification of spectral type earlier than @xmath52 .",
    "subset 1 has 111 stars not found in subset 2 ; subset 2 has 44 stars not found in subset 1 .",
    "this gives @xmath26=345.5 $ ] and @xmath53=77.5 $ ] and hence @xmath54 .",
    "the trial functions used in the following sections give estimates of the total number in the range 445667 , which embraces the actual total of 601 stars .",
    "the median estimate is 546 .",
    "the method estimates the total number of quasars in the parameter space defined by the boundaries of a data set  that is , the total number of quasars lying within the magnitude , redshift and sed ranges of the data set .",
    "we have applied the method to three suitable data sets , each based on two different survey techniques but satisfying our condition that @xmath55 .",
    "_ data set 1 _ is based on a survey of quasars in eso / serc field 287 by @xcite ( see also : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "quasar candidates were selected primarily by variability ( @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a variability parameter typically ten times the amplitude of the variability ) , although a uv - excess ( uvx ) criterion @xmath58 was also used .",
    "the survey actually consists of three samples : ( i ) a faint sample of 111 quasars covering 4.6 @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath5 ; ( ii ) a bright sample of 117 quasars covering 18.8 @xmath59 with @xmath61 and @xmath5 ; ( iii ) and a high - redshift sample of 86 quasars covering 18.8 @xmath59 with @xmath4 and @xmath62 .",
    "we construct data set 1 from the faint sample and those quasars from the bright sample that lie within the boundaries of the faint sample .",
    "it comprises 170 quasars covering 4.6 @xmath59 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have not considered quasars with @xmath62 as they were not sampled by two independent methods but were selected jointly on their colour and variability .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity limit for data set 1 is @xmath63 .",

    "only 7 quasars are found by variability that are not found by uvx whereas uvx finds 25 quasars not detected by their variability , which gives @xmath53=16 $ ] .",
    "_ data set 2 _ is based on two quasar surveys of eso / serc field 927 : ( i ) a sparse - sampling survey of 118 quasars , selected by the automated quasar detection software ( aqd ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , covering @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; clowes , campusano & graham , in preparation ) ; ( ii ) a survey of 151 quasars , selected by uv - excess @xmath68 , covering @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath67 ( @xcite ) .",
    "data set 2 is constructed from all the uvx - selected quasars with @xmath5 and all the aqd - selected quasars with @xmath71 that lie within the boundaries of the uvx survey .",
    "it comprises 141 quasars in @xmath69 and has an intrinsic luminosity limit of @xmath72 .",
    "135 quasars were found in the uvx survey and 49 quasars in the aqd survey satisfying the relevant criteria .",
    "only 6 quasars were found by aqd that were not detected by uvx whereas uvx found 92 quasars not detected by aqd .",
    "thus , @xmath26=92 $ ] and @xmath53=49 $ ] .",
    "_ data set 3 _ is based on two surveys of selected area 57 ( sa57 ) : ( i ) a survey of 30 quasars , selected by multicolour techniques , covering 0.29 deg@xmath49 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xcite ) ; ( ii ) a survey of 19 quasars , selected from _ rosat _",
    "hri observations of sa57 , covering @xmath75 with a limiting flux of @xmath76 erg s@xmath12 @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xcite ) .",
    "data set 3 is constructed from all _ rosat-_selected quasars and all quasars from koo & kron that lie within @xmath79 of the _ rosat _ pointing centre .",
    "it comprises 19 quasars covering @xmath75 .",
    "17 quasars were identified by koo & kron that meet the relevant criteria and 19 by _ rosat_. no quasars were found by koo & kron that were not found by _",

    "note , however , that of the 33 sources detected by _ rosat _ in sa57 , 7 are classed as faint stellar objects .",
    "these could be quasars but they would be fainter than the magnitude limit of @xmath80 of koo & kron ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the values of @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] for the three data sets to fit different trial functions , @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17 and the corresponding estimates of the total number of quasars are given in table  [ result ] .",
    "the figure in parentheses after each estimate is the completeness of the data set based on the estimated total number for the data set .",
    "the lower limit to the total number of quasars is also given . with two techniques contributing to a data set",
    "the trial functions have only two free parameters . however , the trial functions give a good coverage of the possible functional forms of the true visibility function .",
    "the estimates show that : data set 1 is 6399% complete ; data set 2 is 4772% complete ; and data set 3 is 61100% complete . if we use the median estimates then : data set 1 is 89% complete ; data set 2 is 54% complete ; and data set 3 is 90% complete .",
    "if we assume that there were errors of @xmath81 in the numbers of common @xmath82 and distinct @xmath83 objects comprising each survey then the typical error in the estimate of the total number of objects is @xmath845% in data set 1 , @xmath845% in data set 2 , and @xmath8415% in data set 3 .",
    "the success rates , for median estimates , of the individual selection techniques are : variability ( with @xmath56 ) selects 76% and uvx ( with @xmath85 ) 86% of the total population of quasars for data set 1 ; uvx ( with @xmath86 selects 52% and aqd 19% of the total for data set 2 ; ( the aqd survey is by sparse sampling ) ; colour selection finds 81% and x - ray 90% of the total for data set 3 .",
    "random incompleteness  effectively sparse sampling  does not affect the expectation values of any statistics if the sampling rate is known ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , systematic incompleteness ( e.g.  bias against the detection of low - redshift or low - luminosity quasars ) means that a sample is non - random and incorrect conclusions may be drawn .",
    "samples of quasars selected by uv - excess ( @xmath87 ) are normally assumed , following @xcite , to contain at least 90% of the quasars with @xmath5 within a given survey .",
    "however our results suggest that a large fraction of quasars with @xmath5 , possibly as high as 50% ( from data set 2 ) , do not have a large uv - excess and must have been missed by previous uvx surveys , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "such losses could have serious consequences if the incompleteness is systematic .",
    "we can test for systematic incompleteness by examining the effectiveness of selection by uvx for different @xmath88 limits . to do this , we take data set 1 and consider uvx limits of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "one possibility is that a limit of @xmath89 is biased against low redshift quasars @xmath91 .",
    "a plot of @xmath88 against redshift for all quasars in data set 1 suggests that this is likely ( see hawkins & vron 1995 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "for data set 1 , table [ result ] shows the effectiveness of selection by uvx for @xmath92 .",
    "the figure in parentheses after each estimate is the effectiveness of selection by uvx with the relevant uvx limit .",
    "the lower limit to the total number of quasars present is also given .",
    "if only low redshift quasars were being missed for @xmath89 then for @xmath93 the effectiveness for the two uvx limits should be approximately the same .",
    "this is clearly not the case .",
    "a second possibility is that a limit of @xmath89 is biased against low luminosity quasars .",
    "several authors have considered such a bias as likely but estimate the incompleteness at @xmath94% ( e.g.  boyle et al .",
    "note that a survey that arbitrarily defines a quasar to have @xmath95 ( schmidt & green 1983 ) would also be biased against low luminosity quasars . for data set 1 , table",
    "[ result ] similarly shows the effectiveness of selection by uvx for @xmath96 .",
    "if only low luminosity quasars were being missed for @xmath89 then for @xmath97 the effectiveness for the two uvx limits should be approximately the same .",
    "this is indeed the case .    in summary ,",
    "a quasar sample selected by @xmath89 is systematically incomplete , being biased in particular against low luminosity quasars .",
    "part of the incompleteness is probably caused by detectable radiation from the host galaxy .",
    "this will redden the quasar and it will cause losses in surveys that require candidates to be classified as star - like .    from parkes flat - spectrum quasars , @xcite have suggested the existence of three categories : ( i ) conventional blue quasars ( 40% ) ; ( ii ) red quasars , with reddening from synchrotron radiation ( 30% ) ; ( iii ) very red quasars , with reddening from dust ( 30% ) .",
    "these last two categories of red quasars , being faint in @xmath24 , could be the type of objects that comprise the low luminosity population suggested by our analysis .",
    "the incompleteness revealed by this work , has implications for some of the new generation of large quasar surveys . for illustration ,",
    "consider the aat 2df quasar survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "this currently specifies @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and has a projected final completeness of @xmath100 . adapting data set 1 to have the same selection criteria gives @xmath26=124 $ ] and @xmath53=29.5 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding lower limit to the total number of quasars is @xmath101 and the median value of the five estimators is 217 .",
    "104 quasars are detected with @xmath98 .",
    "thus , our results imply that at best the aat 2df survey will select only 64% of all quasars with @xmath99 and @xmath5 .",
    "previous determinations of the quasar luminosity function ( lf ) could have significantly underestimated the density of low - luminosity quasars .",
    "we can now estimate the incompleteness , correct for it , and so determine the ` true ' lf .    for data set 1 , we have divided the ranges of apparent magnitude and redshift into bins : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ; @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "within each joint magnitude and redshift bin , we have estimated the ` true ' surface density of quasars using both the maximum completeness estimator , @xmath109 , and the median completeness estimator , @xmath110 .",
    "we have generated ` best - fit ' models to these data using maximum likelihood techniques for various parametric forms for the lf .",
    "we consider two models involving pure luminosity evolution with parametric forms given by @xcite : a smoothed double power - law function    @xmath111    and a single power - law function    @xmath112    where , in both cases , the redshift dependence , m(z ) , can be expressed either as a @xmath113 power - law evolution , @xmath114 , or as an exponential evolution with look - back time , @xmath115 .",
    "the look - back time expressed as a fraction of the age of the universe is @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 is a normalisation factor .",
    "we consider also a model with density and luminosity evolution parameterized as    @xmath118    where the density evolution function is expressed as an exponential with look - back time    @xmath119    @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the free parameters that determine the fit",
    ".    the maximum - likelihood solution is found in each case by minimizing the function :    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the observed surface density in magnitude bin @xmath127 and redshift bin @xmath128 , @xmath129 is the expected surface density in bin @xmath127 and bin @xmath128 , and the summation is over all bins .",
    "each ` best - fit ' model was tested for goodness - of - fit using the pearson @xmath130 statistic .",
    "table  [ bestfit ] gives the best - fit parameters for the models and their @xmath130 probabilities , @xmath131 .",
    "for comparison , we have calculated how well some of the best - fit models of @xcite , normalised appropriately , fit the data ; these are also included in table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "we can reject a single power - law lf and all of the best - fit models of boyle et al .",
    "of the remaining models , all of which incorporate double power - law lfs , the data are well described by those with density evolution .",
    "the best fits are obtained when all evolution is expressed by exponentials with look - back time .",

    "( model b ) , normalised appropriately , is also shown . at low redshifts the boyle et al .",
    "model underestimates the number of faint quasars and at intermediate redshifts it underestimates the number of brighter quasars .",
    "2 shows the lf corresponding to our best - fit model extrapolated to @xmath132 . for comparison",
    "the figure also shows : the lf derived from local seyfert galaxies of types 1 and 1.5 ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ) ; the lf for soft x - ray selected agn ( @xcite ) , extrapolated to @xmath6 ; and boyle et al .",
    "model b , extrapolated to @xmath132 .",
    "our model provides the best - fit to the local seyferts .",
    "the curve for x - ray selected agns ( including all types ) lies a factor of @xmath133 above our lf , which suggests that other types of agn ( e.g. starburst galaxies ) are not related to quasars .",
    "compared with the most successful model of boyle et al .",
    "( model b ) , our lf shows an increase in the number of low luminosity quasars at low redshifts and of brighter quasars at intermediate redshifts .",
    "it also matches well the lf of local seyfert galaxies .",
    "such behaviour is consistent with quasar models in which evolution is caused by the progressive exhaustion of the fuel supply to the central black hole .",
    "quasars fade from an initial bright phase until a low , quasi - steady rate of energy production is reached .",

    "<S> we apply a simple statistical method ( derenzo & hildebrand 1969 ) to estimating the completeness of quasar surveys . </S>",
    "<S> it requires that an area has been covered by two or more , preferably different , selection techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we use three suitable data sets with separate selections from : variability and uv - excess ( 170 quasars ) ; objective prism and uv - excess ( 141 quasars ) ; multicolour and x - ray ( _ rosat , _ 19 quasars ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for selection by uv - excess , the common limit of @xmath0 leads to losses of @xmath1 , typically missing low - luminosity @xmath2 quasars , independently of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> systematic incompleteness will therefore affect the new generation of large quasar surveys that select by @xmath3 . by correcting for this incompleteness </S>",
    "<S> , we find , from the first data set ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , that the evolution of the quasar luminosity function ( lf ) is best described by joint luminosity and density evolution . </S>",
    "<S> when extrapolated to @xmath6 , the lf matches that of local seyfert galaxies better than any previous determination . </S>",
    "<S> the lf shows an increase in the number of low - luminosity quasars at low redshifts and of brighter quasars at intermediate redshifts , relative to the lf of boyle et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1990 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with models in which quasars fade from an initial bright phase .    </S>",
