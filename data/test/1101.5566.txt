    "in fact , it is suffice to hold condition ( 33 ) only because it is more strong .    in the calculations made above",

    "so the medium corrections to the vertex are inessential for us .",
    "the same is true for the model * b*.    consider now the baryon - number - violating decay @xmath147 [ 21 ] shown in fig .",

    "3d can not produce interference , since it contains @xmath154-meson in the final state .",
    "for the rest of the diagrams the significant interferences are unlikely because the final states in @xmath155 annihilation are very complicated configurations and persistent phase relations between different amplitudes can not be expected .",
    "this qualitative picture is confirmed by our calculations [ 22 ] for @xmath156-nuclear annihilation .",
    "it is easy to verify the following statement : if the incoherent contribution of the diagrams 3a-3c to the total nuclear annihilation width is taken into account , the lower limit on the free - space @xmath0 oscillation time @xmath2 becomes even better .",
    "to summarise , the contribution of diagrams 3 is inessential for us .",
    "the non - trivial circumstance is the quadratic time - dependence in the model * a * : @xmath157 .",
    "the heart of the problem is as follows .",
    "the processes depicted by the diagrams 2b and 3 are described by the exponential decay law . in the first vertex of these diagrams",
