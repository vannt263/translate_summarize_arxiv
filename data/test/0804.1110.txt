    "the physics of systems involving large numbers of interacting agents is currently a thriving field of research @xcite .",
    "one of its many appeals lies in the opportunity it offers to apply precise methods and tools of physics to the realm of `` soft '' science . in this",
    "respect , biological , economic , and a large variety of human systems present many examples of competitive dynamics that can be studied qualitatively or even quantitatively by statistical physics . among them , sports competitions are particularly appealing because of the large amount of data available , their popularity , and the fact that they constitute almost perfectly _ isolated _ systems . indeed , most systems considered in econophysics @xcite or evolutionary biology @xcite are strongly affected by external and often unpredictable factors . for instance",
    ", a financial model can not predict the occurrence of wars or natural disasters which dramatically affect financial markets , nor can it include the effect of many other important external parameters ( china s gdp growth , german exports , google s profit  ) . on the other hand ,",
    "sport leagues ( soccer @xcite , baseball @xcite , football @xcite  ) or tournaments ( basketball @xcite , poker @xcite  ) are basically isolated systems that are much less sensitive to external influences . hence , despite their intrinsic human nature , which actually contribute to their appeal , competitive sports are particularly suited to quantitative theoretical modeling . in this spirit , this work is focused on basic statistical features of game outcomes in major - league baseball .    in major - league baseball and indeed in any competitive sport , the main observable is the outcome of a single game  who wins and who loses .",
    "then at the end of a season , the win / loss record of each team is fundamental . as statistical physicists ,",
    "we are not concerned with the fates of individual teams , but rather with the average win / loss record of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , _ etc .",
    "_ teams , as well as the statistical properties of winning and losing streaks .",
    "we concentrate on major - league baseball to illustrate statistical properties of game outcomes because of the large amount of available data @xcite and the near constancy of the game rules during the so - called `` modern era '' that began in 1901 .    for non - us readers or for non - baseball fans , during the modern era of major - league baseball",
    ", teams have been divided into the nearly - independent american and national leagues @xcite . at the end of each season",
    "a champion of the american and national leagues is determined ( by the best team in each league prior to 1961 and by league playoffs subsequently ) that play in the world series to determine the champion . as the data will reveal",
    ", it is also useful to separate the 19011960 early modern era , with a 154-game season and 16 teams , and the 19612005 expansion era , with a 162-game season in which the number of teams expanded in stages to its current value of 30 , to highlight systematic differences between these two periods .",
    "our data is based on the 163674 regular - season games that have occurred between 1901 and the end of the 2005 season ( 72741 between 190160 and 90933 between 19612005 ) .    while the record of each team can change significantly from year to year , we find that the _ time average _ win / loss record of the @xmath3-ranked team as a function of rank @xmath4 is strikingly regular .",
    "one of our goals is to understand the rank dependence of this win fraction",
    ". an important outcome of our study is that the bradley - terry ( bt ) competition model @xcite provides an excellent account of the team win / loss records .",
    "this agreement between the data and theory is predicated on using a specific form for the distribution of team strengths .",
    "we will argue that the best match to the data is achieved by using a uniform distribution of teams strengths in each season .",
    "another goal of this work is to understand the statistical features of consecutive - game team winning and losing streaks .",
    "the existence of long streaks of all types of exceptional achievement in baseball , as well as in most competitive sports , have been well documented @xcite and continue to be the source of analysis and debate among sports fans . for long consecutive - game team winning and team losing streaks ,",
    "an often - invoked theme is the notion of reinforcement  a team that is `` on a roll '' is more likely to continue winning , and vice versa for a slumping team on a losing streak .",
    "the question of whether streaks are purely statistical or self reinforcing continues to be vigorously debated @xcite . using the bt model and our inferred uniform distribution of team strengths , we compute the streak length distribution . we find that the theoretical prediction agrees extremely well with the streak data during 19612005 . however , there is a slight discrepancy between theory and the tail of the streak distribution during 190160 , suggesting that non - statistical effects may have played a role during this early period .    as a byproduct of our study",
    ", we find clear evidence that baseball has been more competitive during 19612005 than during 190160 and feature that has been found previously @xcite .",
    "the manifestation of this increased competitiveness is that the range of team records and the length of streaks was narrower during the latter period .",
    "this observation fits with the general principle @xcite that outliers become progressively rarer in a highly competitive environment .",
    "consequently , extremes of achievement become less and less likely to occur .",
    "our starting point to account for the win / loss records of all baseball teams is the bt model @xcite that incorporates the heterogeneity in team strengths in a natural and simple manner .",
    "we assume that each team has an intrinsic strength @xmath5 that is fixed for each season .",
    "the probability that a team of strength @xmath5 wins when it plays a team of strength @xmath6 is simply @xmath7 thus the winning probability depends continuously on the strengths of the two competing teams @xcite .",
    "when two equal - strength teams play , each team has a 50% probability to win , while if one team is much stronger , then its winning probability approaches 1 .",
    "the form of the winning probability of eq .",
    "is quite general .",
    "indeed , we can replace the team strength @xmath5 by any monotonic function @xmath8 .",
    "the only indispensable attribute is the ordering of the team strengths .",
    "thus the notion of strength is coupled to the assumed form of the winning probability .",
    "if we make a hypothesis about one of these quantities , then the other is no longer a variable that we are free to choose , but an outcome of the model . in our analysis",
    ", we adopt the form of the winning probability in eq .   because of its simplicity .",
    "then the only relevant unknown quantity is the probability distribution of the @xmath5 s . as we shall see in the next section , this distribution of team strengths",
    "can then be inferred from the season - end win / loss records of the teams , and a good fit to the data is obtained when assuming a uniform distribution of team strengths . because only the ratio of team strengths is relevant in eq .",
    ", we therefore take team strengths to be uniformly distributed in the range @xmath9 $ ] , with @xmath10 .",
    "thus the only model parameter is the value of @xmath11 .    for uniformly distributed team strengths @xmath12 that lie in @xmath13 $ ] , the average winning fraction for a team of strength @xmath14 that plays a large number of games @xmath15 , with equal frequencies against each opponent is @xmath16 where we assume @xmath17 in the second line .",
    "we then transform from strength @xmath14 to scaled rank @xmath4 by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 corresponding to the weakest and strongest team , respectively ( fig .",

    ", we then compute the average win fraction @xmath31 of each team as function of its scaled rank @xmath4 .",
    "we then incrementally update the value of @xmath11 to minimize the difference between the simulated values of @xmath31 with those from game win / loss data .",
    "nearly the same results are found if each team plays every opponent with equal probability or equally often , as long as the number of teams and number of games is not unrealistically small .",
    "the bt model , with each team playing each opponent with the same probability , gives very good fits to the data by choosing @xmath22 for the period 190160 , and @xmath24 for 19612005 ( fig .",
    "[ w - frac ] ) .",
    "if the actual game frequencies in each season are used to determine opponents , @xmath11 changes slightly  to 0.289 for 190160but remains unchanged for 19612005 .",
    "despite the fact that the number of teams has increased from 16 to 30 since in 1961 , the range of win fractions is larger in the early era ( 0.320.67 ) than in the expansion era ( 0.360.63 ) , a feature that indicates that baseball has become more competitive .",
    "this observation accords with the notion that the pressure of continuous competition , as in baseball , gradually diminishes the likelihood of outliers @xcite .",
    "given the crudeness of the model and real features that we have ignored , such as home - field advantage ( approximately 53% for the past century and slowly decreasing with time ) , imbalanced playing schedules , and in - season personnel changes due to trades and player injuries , the agreement between the data and simulations of the bt model is satisfying .",
    "it is worth noting in fig .",
    "[ w - frac ] is that the win fraction data and the corresponding numerical results from simulations of the bt model deviate from the theoretical prediction given in eq .",
    "when @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this discrepancy is simply a finite - season effect . as shown in fig .",
    "[ w - conv ] , when we simulate the bt model for progressively longer seasons , the win / loss data gradually converges to the prediction of eq .  .",
    "the present model not only reproduces the average win record @xmath31 over a given period , but it also correctly explains the season - to - season fluctuation @xmath34 of the win fraction defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the winning fraction of the @xmath3-ranked team during the @xmath37 season and @xmath38 is the average win fraction of the @xmath3-ranked team and @xmath39 is the number of years in the period .",
    "these fluctuations are the largest for extremal teams ( and minimal for average teams ) .",
    "there is also an asymmetry of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "our simulations of the bt model with the optimal @xmath11 values that were determined previously by fitting to the win fraction quantitatively reproduce these two features of @xmath40 .     for 190160 ( @xmath20 ) and for 19612005 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the dashed lines are numerical simulations of the bt model for @xmath29 periods with the same @xmath11 as in fig .",
    "[ w - frac].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in addition to the finite - season effects described above , another basic consequence of the finiteness of the season is that the intrinsically strongest team does not necessarily have the best win / loss record .",
    "that is , the average win fraction @xmath42 does not necessarily increase with team strength . by luck , a strong team can have a poor record or vice versa .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the number of games @xmath43 that need to be played to ensure that the win / loss record properly reflects team strength .",
    "the difference in the number of wins of two adjacent teams in the standings is proportional to @xmath44 , namely , the number of games times their strength difference ; the latter is proportional to @xmath45 for a league that consists of @xmath46 teams .",
    "this systematic contribution to the difference should significantly exceed random fluctuations , which are of the order of @xmath47 .",
    "thus we require @xmath48 for the end - of - season standings to be ordered by team strength .",
    "[ w - conv ] and fig .",
    "[ sigma ] illustrate the fact that this effect is more important for the top - ranked and bottom - ranked teams . during the 190160 period , when major - league baseball consisted of independent american and national leagues , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , so that the season was just long enough to resolve adjacent teams . currently , however , the season length is insufficient to resolve adjacent teams .",
    "the natural way to deal with this ambiguity is to expand the number of teams that qualify for the post - season playoffs , which is what is currently done .",
    "does the bt model with uniform teams strength provide the most appropriate description of the win / loss data ?",
    "we perform several tests to validate this model . first ,",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the assumption for the winning probability can be recast more generally as @xmath52 so that an arbitrary @xmath53 reduces to the original winning probability in eq .  .",
    "hence the crucial model assumption is the separability of the winning probability .",
    "in particular , the bt model assumes that @xmath54 is _ only _ a function of characteristics of team @xmath55 , divided by characteristics of team @xmath56 .",
    "one consequence of this separability is the `` detailed - balance '' relation @xmath57 for any triplet of teams .",
    "this relation quantifies the obvious fact that if team @xmath58 likely beats @xmath59 , and @xmath59 likely beats @xmath60 , then @xmath58 is likely to beat @xmath60 .",
    "since we do not know the actual @xmath30 in a given baseball season , we instead consider @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of wins of team @xmath55 against @xmath56 , and @xmath63 is the number of game they played against each other in a given season . if seasons were infinitely long , then @xmath64 , and hence @xmath65     periods ( dashed lines ) , where each period corresponds to the results of all baseball games during either 190160 ( triangles ) or 19602005 ( circles ) .",

    ", as shown in fig .  [ streaks - sep ]",
    "to conclude , the bradley - terry ( bt ) competition model , in which the outcome of any game depends only on the relative strengths of the two competing teams , quantitatively accounts for the average win / loss records of major - league baseball teams .",
    "the distribution of team strengths that gives the best match to these win / loss records was found to be quite close to uniform over a range @xmath9 $ ] , with @xmath145 for the early modern era of 19011960 and @xmath146 for the expansion era of 19612005 .",
    "this same bt model also reproduces the season - to - season fluctuations of the win / loss records .",
    "an important consequence of the bt model is the existence of a non trivial detailed - balance relation which we verified with satisfying accuracy .",
    "we consider this verification as a quite stringent test of the theory .",
    "the same bt model was also used to account for the distribution of team consecutive - game winning and losing streaks .",
    "we found excellent agreement between the prediction of the bt model and the streak data for @xmath147 for both the 1901 - 60 and 1961 - 2005 periods .",
    "however , the tail of the streak distribution for the 190160 period with @xmath139 is less accurately described by the bt theory and it is an open question about the mechanisms for the discrepancy , although it could well originate from lack of statistics .",
    "we also provided evidence that self - reinforcement plays little role in streaks , as randomizations of the actual win / loss records produces streak distributions that are indistinguishable from the streak data except in for the @xmath139 tail during the 1901 - 60 period .",
    "we also showed that the optimal team strength distribution is narrower for the period 19612005 compared to 190160 .",
    "this narrowing shows that baseball competition is becoming keener so that outliers in team performance over an entire season  as quantified by win / loss records and lengths of winning and losing streaks  are less likely to occur .",
    "we close by emphasizing the parsimonious nature of our modeling .",
    "the only assumed features are the bradley - terry form eq .   for the outcome of a single game , and the uniform distribution of the winning probabilities , controlled by the single free parameter @xmath11 .",
    "all other model features can then be inferred from the data .",
    "while we have ignored many aspects of baseball that ought to play some role  the strength of a team changing during a season due to major trades of players and/or injuries , home - field advantage , etc.the agreement between the win fraction data and the streak data with the predictions of the bradley - terry model are extremely good",
    ". it will be worthwhile to apply the approaches of this paper to other major sports to learn about possible universalities and idiosyncracies in the statistical features of game outcomes .",
