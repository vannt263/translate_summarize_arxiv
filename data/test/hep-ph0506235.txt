    "the leading order bfkl kernel  @xcite , derived from feynman diagrams in momentum space , has been investigated in much detail . as a function of the transverse momenta , it is a meromorphic function . in the color singlet exchange channel",
    ", it describes the pomeron contribution in pqcd , consisting of ladder diagrams with reggeized gluons .",
    "this bfkl pomeron couples to the impact factors of colourless particles which , because of gauge invariance , vanish as one of the two reggeized gluons carries a zero transverse momentum .",
    "this property allows us to modify the space of functions to which the pomeron wave function belongs . on the other hand , in the color octet exchange channel",
    "the bfkl equation has the bootstrap solution , which represents a fundamental consistency property derived from the s - channel unitarity .",
    "a manifestation of this bootstrap property also takes place for the color singlet state of two gluons and inside the coupling of three or more gluons to colorless particle impact factors .",
    "in particular , it plays an important role in the odderon solution  @xcite which appears as a bound state of three reggeized gluons .",
    "an important virtue of the color singlet kernel is its invariance under the mbius transformations in the space of transverse coordinates . exploiting the gauge invariance of the colorless impact factor to which the bfkl pomeron couples , the mbius symmetry allows to search solutions of the bfkl eigenvalues equation in the space of mbius functions which vanish as the coordinates of the two reggeized gluons coincide , and to define a spectral representation of the bfkl kernel in terms of conformal eigenfunctions . in this space of functions",
    ", the bfkl kernel also enjoys the property of holomorphic separability .",
    "translating back to the momentum representation , the kernel in the corresponding spectral form acquires @xmath4 function - like pieces which , because of the special properties of the impact factors , do not contribute to physical amplitudes .    as mentioned above , the bfkl kernel , when applied to the color octet wave function in momentum space , satisfies the bootstrap condition , which reflects the s - channel consistency of the bfkl calculation .",
    "when transforming to transverse coordinates one finds that , in the space of mbius functions , this bootstrap condition can not be satisfied , i.e. the colour octet wave function lies outside this space of functions . in this paper",
    "we will define a similarity transform , @xmath5 , which takes us from the mbius space of functions ( m space ) to another space of functions ( named ` analytic feynman diagram ' ( af ) space ) in which the bootstrap holds .",
    "with the same transformation we can also define ` deformed ' mbius transformations and a ` deformed ' spectral representation of the bfkl kernel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we review the properties of the bfkl kernel , both in momentum space and in the space of transverse coordinates . in section 3",
    "we introduce the deformed representation , and we define the similarity transform which takes us from the mbius space ( @xmath6 space ) to the new deformed space ( @xmath7 space ) of functions . in section 4",
    "we explicitly show that , in the @xmath7 representation , the bootstrap properties are fulfilled .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the deformed representation of the conformal algebra which follows from the particular choice of the scalar product ; in particular we compute the transformed generators of the mbius group @xmath0 .",
    "some details of our calculations are collected in two appendices .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of the bfkl approach describing the dynamics of the reggeized gluons in lla of perturbative qcd .",
    "let us start from the schrdinger - like bfkl equation @xcite describing the compound state of two reggeized gluons , @xmath8 here @xmath9 labels the colour representation of the two gluon state and in the singlet and octet channel one has respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the symbol @xmath12 denotes an integration in the transverse space in the case of the integral operator @xmath13 , while @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-channel angular momentum .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath17 give the positions of singularities of the @xmath16 channel partial waves , related to the scattering amplitude by the mellin transformation in the variable @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the squared total energy of colliding particles .",
    "in lla , in the momentum representation , the gluon trajectory ( scaled by @xmath20 ) is given by the well known expression @xmath21 and the interaction term is defined by its action on the wave functions @xmath22",
    "\\phi(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ k$}_1^{\\prime},\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}-\\mbox{\\boldmath $ k$}_1^{\\prime } )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 .",
    "let us note that this form is proper when the kernel acts on amputated ( without gluon propagators ) impact factors , otherwise the propagators should be removed from the kernel , as for example is the case for the expression in eq .",
    "( [ bfkl_mom ] ) .",
    "we stress that this form of the ll bfkl kernel is obtained directly from the feynman diagrams analysis in perturbative qcd and has a simple analytic behavior in the transverse momentum space .",
    "in particular it does not contain @xmath4-functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in the construction of the bfkl kernels",
    "a very important property is the gluon reggeization which can be verified with the bootstrap relation for the amplitude with the octet quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the bootstrap relation is a consequence of the @xmath19-channel unitarity .",
    "it claims , that the scattering amplitude with octet quantum numbers obtained as a solution of the corresponding bfkl equation should coincide with the born term multiplied by the regge factor @xmath26 .",
    "because the bfkl equation was obtained by summing contributions from the multi - particle production described by the multi - regge amplitudes , the bootstrap relation valid in the leading and next - to - leading orders allows to connect the gluon trajectory and interaction terms . in lla",
    "the bootstrap condition for the bfkl kernel can be written as @xmath27 where the constant @xmath28 is the wave function which can be conveniently obtained after rescaling any function depending only on @xmath29 , and the kernel @xmath30 acts on the amputated amplitudes .",
    "let us note that it is crucial in the bootstrap relation in lla that the two gluons are located at the same point in the transverse coordinate plane .",
    "it has played a crucial role in the discovery of the leading odderon solution in the lla of perturbative qcd  @xcite and also some general relation  @xcite between bound states of @xmath31 and @xmath32 reggeized gluons .    in the following",
    "we shall use its equivalent form  @xcite , which has the virtue of being infrared finite and which uses the standard bfkl singlet kernel : @xmath33    on using an infrared mass regularization ( @xmath34 ) one may write @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so that a relation equivalent to the bootstrap , but explicitely infraredly finite , is given by @xmath38    the 2-gluon kernel ( [ bfkleq ] ) in the singlet channel has been investigated in great details in the coordinate representation  @xcite . the amplitude for the scattering of colorless objects is factorized , in the high energy limit , in the product of the green s function ( which exponentiates the bfkl kernel ) and two impact factors .",
    "the impact factors vanish as the momentum of one of the attached reggeized gluons goes to zero .",
    "this permits to choose a special representation for the two - gluon propagator and for the full bfkl kernel acting in the space of the so called mbius functions ( for two gluon states these are functions @xmath39 such that @xmath40 )  @xcite .",
    "this is a special choice among infinite others compatible with the gauge freedom of integrating a colorless impact factor with any function belonging to the set defined by the equivalence relation @xmath41 since the corresponding shift in the momentum representation is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "in such a representation the operators are mbius ( conformal ) invariant   @xcite . using complex coordinates , the bfkl hamiltonian @xmath43 acting on functions with propagators",
    "included can be written in the operator form @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and we introduced the gluon holomorphic momenta @xmath46 . on the mbius space of functions",
    "the holomorphic separability applies : @xmath47 and it is possible to find more easily the solutions of the homogeneous bfkl pomeron equation which belong to irreducible unitary representations of the mbius group .",
    "in particular the symmetry generators in this representation are @xmath48 for two reggeized gluons one has @xmath49 and the casimir operator is defined as follows @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the bfkl kernel are also eigenstates of two casimir operators and given by @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 are conformal weights for the principal series of the unitary representations of the mbius group , @xmath31 is the conformal spin and @xmath56 is the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath57 describing the compound state of two reggeized gluons ( note , that here and below we use other notations for conformal weights @xmath58 in refs .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues of the bfkl kernel are given by @xmath59    the action of the bfkl kernel can also be written , again on the space of mbius functions , after a duality transformation  @xcite , in terms of integral operator appearing in the dipole picture @xcite @xmath60    we now consider the pomeron eigenstates in the momentum representation .",
    "different forms of the fourier transform of the function in eq .",
    "( [ pomstatescoord ] ) have been given in the most general case .",
    "one finds a sum of an analytic term @xmath61 , which has been given in an explicit way or in a integral form , and a @xmath4-like one @xmath62 .",
    "more precisely we obtain @xmath63 where a bra - ket compact notation is also introduced . by explicit",
    "computation one finds @xmath64 \\frac{i^n}{2\\pi } 2^{1-h-\\bar{h } } \\frac{\\gamma(1-\\bar{h})}{\\gamma(h ) } q^{\\bar{h}-1 } q^{*\\ , h-1 } \\ , , \\label{pom_delta}\\ ] ] where the complex form @xmath65 of any bidimensional transverse vector @xmath66 ( coordinate or momentum ) is used . in the calculation of a physical cross section one performs integrations with two - gluon colourless impact factors and this @xmath4-like term gives zero contribution , so that all the physics is related to the analytic term .",
    "in fact the @xmath4-terms have been introduced when one has chosen to move to the mbius representation which is characterized by the simple and beautiful form in the coordinate representation .",
    "the analytic part can be written , for example , as given in  @xcite wherein one finds @xmath67 with the coefficient @xmath68 given by @xmath69 the expression for @xmath70 in complex notation was written in terms of the hypergeometric functions @xmath71 another expression for @xmath72 which will be very useful for our purposes has been given in  @xcite in an integral form : @xmath73^{\\bar{h}-1 } \\left [ \\frac{p^ * ( q^*-p^*)}{k_1^*-p^*}\\right]^{h-1 } \\ , ,   \\label{ana_lip}\\ ] ] where @xmath74    below we shall consider the completeness relation and the spectral representation for the bfkl kernel ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us before discuss the scalar product in the space of functions where the kernel is acting on .",
    "for the kernel in the momentum space associated to the feynman diagram derivation there is only one scalar product available .",
    "if we consider non amputated functions of two momenta @xmath75 , i.e. with 2-dimensional propagators @xmath76 included , the scalar product is defined as @xmath77 with the integration measure @xmath78 which kills the extra propagators .    in the mbius space of functions ( in coordinate space ) for the principal series of the mbius group representation ,",
    "whenever functions with conformal weight @xmath79 or @xmath80 are not considered , two possible choices are available  @xcite .",
    "since the mbius functions contain propagators , one possibility is to remove , as before , the propagators in one function , acting with the operator @xmath81 .",
    "the other possibility , related to the form of the casimir operator of the mbius group , is to use instead the measure @xmath82 .",
    "the latter is not equivalent to the former when we consider the conformal wheights @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "note , that , providing that we go from the regge kinematics to the deep - inelastic scattering in the bjorken regime , the additional series of the unitary representations of the mbius group should be also used  @xcite ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now consider the completeness relation in coordinate space  @xcite , in the space of mbius functions , where the eigenfunctions of the casimir operator of the mbius group , defined in ( [ pomstatescoord ] ) , constitute a suitable spectral basis for the operators acting on the space of the colourless impact factors , which , we stress , never `` feel '' the presence of the terms with a @xmath4-distribution behavior in momentum space , i.e. those of eq .",
    "( [ pom_delta ] ) . for the operators amputated ( spatial propagators removed ) to the left ( with notation @xmath83 and @xmath84 )",
    "one can write @xcite @xmath85 where we have defined the weights @xmath86 , as well as @xmath87 for later use , @xmath88[\\nu^2+(n+1)^2/4]}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 .",
    "if we try to extrapolate these operators to a wider domain which contains functions which no longer vanish for zero momenta , contrary to the colorless impact factor case , one needs some care .",
    "for example , for the function , which in momentum space depends only on the total momentum , just the case we meet in the bootstrap relation in lla , one obtains the the result @xmath90 in coordinate space ( for the amputated impact factor ) .",
    "but such generalized function is orthogonal to the basis constituted by the functions in eq .",
    "( [ pomstatescoord ] ) since @xmath91 and therefore the application of the operators in eq .",
    "( [ coord_relations ] ) on this function will give zero .",
    "in other words the bootstrap relation can not be fullfilled in such a framework with the spectral representations given in eq .",
    "( [ coord_relations ] ) .    but this should not be surprising , since the choice done thanks to the equivalence relation in eq .",
    "( [ uv_transf ] ) , is based on a restriction of the action of the kernel to the functions similar to colorless impact factors .",
    "moving to the momentum representation , one may write the fourier transform of the relations in ( [ coord_relations ] ) and the same considerations done above may be repeated in this case , leading to the same conclusions . in particular",
    "one can not write a bootstrap relation in a spectral basis built upon the states of eq .",
    "( [ pom_mom ] ) . on the other hand one",
    "notices that the bfkl kernel @xmath92 in momentum space , as constructed from the feynman diagram analysis , has an analytic behavior which must be reflected also in its spectral decomposition .",
    "it can also be noted that the behavior in @xmath93 of the @xmath4-like term ( [ pom_delta ] ) is @xmath94 , which is singular in the forward limit where analytic behavior is expected for fixed @xmath95 .",
    "therefore it is natural to suggest the modified relations for the eigenfunction completeness and for the spectral representation of the bfkl kernel : @xmath96 where only the analytic contribution from each state of the spectral basis is used and the measure for integration is defined in eq .",
    "( [ scal_prod ] ) , according to our choice of considering functions with propagators included .",
    "below we shall verify this anzatz .",
    "firstly we consider a space of functions ( with removed propagators ) which includes functions corresponding to the colorless impact factors and at least one function depending only on the total momentum , which is associated to a particular colored impact factor .",
    "secondly we modify the spectral representation of the ll bfkl kernel , wherein the eigenvalues are assumed to be the same expressions of the conformal weights as for the restriction on the mbius space of function , and the eigenfunctions are deformed in order to be analytic in the momentum space .",
    "a similar idea was already considered in the literature in an attempt to couple the ll bfkl pomeron to a quark  @xcite .",
    "we proceed now with the definition of a transformation between the mbius ( m ) basis and the analytic feynman ( af ) basis .",
    "let us observe that one can go from one basis to the other by a simple transformation , which reads in coordinate representation as follows    @xmath97    these relations are clearly non local and have been obtained by noting that @xmath98 for the case of even conformal spins ( @xmath31 ) the second transformation can be written in a simple local form on observing that @xmath99 while for odd conformal spin such a simple transformation is not possible since @xmath100 .",
    "it is related to the fact , that in the last case both functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 satisfy the colour transparancy property @xmath103 , but only @xmath101 has the simple conformal properties .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath104 so that @xmath5 is a 1 - 1 mapping with inverse really given by @xmath105 .",
    "the green s function for the evolution in the rapidity @xmath106 based on the deformed analytic spectral basis was also written above ( see ( [ mom_relations ] ) ) . in the next section",
    "we shall show that with this prescription one is recovering the correct relation compatible with the bootstrap requirement for the gluon reggeization in lla .    since the spectrum in both representations is the same it is natural to expect that the bfkl kernel satisfying the bootstrap relation is conformal invariant , in the new deformed analytic feynman basis obtained by a similarity transformation given by the operator @xmath5 .",
    "namely , the well known generators of the mbius group @xmath107 could be extended to this basis as follows @xmath108 let us summarize the result . if one considers the impact factors derived from feynman diagrams calculations , they are the functions belonging to the af - space and not to the m - space . we remind that we have two different completeness relations based on the two spectral basis @xmath109 and @xmath110 and in these two spaces there are different definitions for scalar products and normalizations of wave functions .",
    "nevertheless the cardinality of the two basis is the same .",
    "the two spaces are related by the 1 - 1 mapping @xmath111 af - space @xmath112 m - space as previously discussed ( see also fig . [ fig_mapping ] ) and",
    "one space is _ shifted _ with respect to the other .",
    "moreover any operator @xmath113 in the af - space which can be decomposed on the spectral basis can be defined on the m - space as @xmath114 and viceversa @xmath115 .",
    "this can be seen as an isometry between the mbius space and the analytical feynman space with the different scalar products in these spaces .",
    "-@xmath28 mapping between the af - space and the m - space.,width=264 ]    the next interesting question is therefore if it is possible to construct explicitely the new representation defined in eq .",
    "( [ derep ] ) .",
    "we shall study this problem in the section @xmath116 , starting from analyzing the fourier transform of the mbius algebra in the m - space and later on moving to the af - space . in the next section",
    "we will show that with the meromorphic prescription we indeed recover the bootstrap properties of the bfkl kernel .",
    "for the sake of using a compact notation , let us introduce for some functions of transverse gluon momenta the corresponding wave functions for a color singlet state .",
    "these are the _ power _",
