    "we are concerned with underlying connections between fluids , elasticity , isometric embedding of riemannian manifolds , and the existence of wrinkled solutions of the underlying nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to develop such connections for the case of two spatial dimensions and examine whether the continuum mechanical equations can be mapped into a corresponding geometric framework and the inherent direct application of the theory of isometric embeddings and the gauss - codazzi equations .",
    "another motivation for such study is to explore the possibility whether the geometric theory can serve an avenue for addressing the admissibility criteria for nonlinear conservation laws in continuum mechanics .    in recent years ,",
    "a theory of _ wild _ solutions to both the incompressible and compressible euler equations in two and higher spatial dimensions has been developed by de lellis , szkelyhidi , and others in @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "the approach is based on the analogy with the highly irregular ( static ) solutions of the isometric embedding of a two - dimensional riemannian manifold into three - dimensional euclidean space given by the nash - kuiper theorem @xcite .",
    "specifically , the analogy arises because of the applicability of gromov s h - principle and convex integration to both problems ( _ cf_. @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the initial value problem in fluid dynamics and the embedding problem in differential geometry would be more than just two analogous issues , and could in fact be mapped one to the other . a first thought on",
    "this issue would suggest that the question is not even meaningful : the fluid problem is dynamic and the embedding problem is static .",
    "thus , if the linkage is to make any sense at all , we must think of the embedding problem as dynamic and derive the equations of a time evolving two - dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "of course , conceptually it is easy to visualize this time evolving two - dimensional riemannian manifold as a two - dimensional surface moving in three - dimensional space that can be seen in such an everyday phenomenon as the vibration of the surface of a drum .",
    "thus , to make the link , we must derive the equations of a new type of geometric flow and then interpret the consequences of this fluid - geometric duality .",
    "in fact , once we have mapped a solution of the euler equations onto the evolving surface , it is rather easy to see that the dynamic metric @xmath0 is a short metric in the sense of the nash - kuiper theorem @xcite with respect to a metric associated with a developable surface . hence , an immediate consequence of our theory is that the evolving manifold can be approximated by wrinkled manifolds ( _ i.e. _ , manifolds with discontinuous second derivatives ) and thus gives some indication of the existence of _ wild _ solutions of the dual fluid problem",
    ". a simple mental picture of the geometric image of the fluid problem would be the motion of @xmath1 wrinkles on a piece of paper .",
    "moreover , the _ wild _ solutions of the geometric problem are completely time - reversible and are in reality a sequence of the nash - kuiper solutions of the embedding problem with the metric given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 corresponds to a developable surface that is time - independent and has non - vanishing mean curvature .",
    "the implication of this fact is immediate : the geometric nash - kuiper _ wild _ solutions are time - reversible .",
    "thus , the question raised in @xcite as to which is the correct admissibility criterion to choose the relevant solution from the infinite number of non - unique solutions to the euler equations , has at least a partial answer .",
    "namely , no dynamic admissibility criterion such as the energy inequality , entropy inequality , entropy rate can serve the purpose , since all the inequalities become the identities for such solutions .",
    "the only possible useful criteria must be meaningful for time reversible fluid flow , such as energy minimization , artificial viscosity @xcite , or viscosity - capillarity @xcite .",
    "the equations for geometric flow are abundant : the einstein equations of general relativity and the ricci flow equations are two of the better known examples . in both of these problems ,",
    "the metric for a riemannian manifold becomes the dynamic unknown .",
    "in the theory developed in this paper , the same situation arises : a dynamic metric @xmath0 is our unknown along with the second fundamental form for the evolving manifold .",
    "furthermore , just as in the case of the einstein equations ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) , the initial data must be consistent with the problem , that is , initially an embedded manifold does exist and the map is also consistent with the divergence free condition on the velocity for the incompressible fluid case . for the einstein equations , this consistency of the initial data yields the einstein constraint equations , while in our case a system of constraint equations is also required . in this paper",
    "we show that our constraint equations have local analytic solutions ; moreover , there is a velocity @xmath4 that defines both a solution of the incompressible euler equations and an evolving two - dimensional riemannian manifold isometrically immersed in @xmath5 .",
    "a similar result is given for the compressible case , as well as for neo - hookean elasticity .",
    "the most important issue is the physical meaning of the results mentioned above . in short ,",
    "we emphasize the comments which have appeared in szkelyhidi @xcite , bardos - titi - wiedermann @xcite , bardos - titi @xcite , and bardos - lopes filho - niu - nussenzveig lopes - titi @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the _ wild _ solutions is due essentially to the application of the euler equations on the initial data that form a discontinuous shear , _",
    "i.e. _ , a vortex sheet .",
    "hence , the euler equations , which have no small scales built into their theory as opposed to the compressible or incompressible navier - stokes equations , have been used in a case where they should not be expected to apply . to this",
    ", we must add the proviso that as again mentioned in de lellis - szkelyhidi @xcite ; also see elling @xcite : these _ wild _ solutions could be a demonstration of fluid turbulence .",
    "the results given in this paper show that , if this is the case , then this _ wild _ fluid turbulent behavior is mirrored by the solutions produced by the non - smooth moving wrinkled surfaces produced by the nash - kuiper theorem @xcite .",
    "this paper consists of nine sections after this brief introduction . in  2 , we recall the euler equations for an inviscid incompressible fluid and the gauss - codazzi equations for the isometric embedding of a two - dimensional riemannian manifold into three - dimensional euclidean space . in ",
    "3 , as discussed above , we derive the equations of the geometric flow , as well as the constraint conditions on the initial data . in  4 , we prove the solvability of the constraint equations for the initial data .",
    "we emphasize that the constraint conditions require the initial fluid velocity _ not _ to be a shear flow .",
    "this assumption pairs nicely with a theorem in de lellis - szeklyhidi @xcite that non - smooth shear flow initial data for both the compressible and incompressible euler equations are _ wild _ data and yield non - unique solutions to the cauchy problem for both the compressible and incompressible euler equations . in fact",
    "our computation suggests that this is the only _ wild _ initial data .",
    "on the other hand , we note that , for the degenerate case , when the fluid motion is a shear flow , we still have a metric that provides the desired map , namely , metric @xmath3 . in  5 , we state and",
    "prove our main result : evolving from the initial data , there exists a metric @xmath0 of geometric flow equations which yields a solution of both the euler equations and the equations describing the evolving isometrically immersed riemannian manifold @xmath6 . in  6",
    ", we continue the discussion of the initial data issue and show that , for the shear flow initial data in the hypotheses of lemma [ l41 ] , the symbol of the underlying system of second order partial differential equations vanishes so that the equations for @xmath0 are degenerate ; however , as we just commented , metric @xmath3 suffices in this singular case . in  7",
    ", we give our principal result : the evolving manifold arising from the euler equations can be approximated by wrinkled @xmath7 manifolds @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "in fluid variables , these wrinkled manifolds correspond to discontinuous shear flows , which thus show conceptually that the discontinuous shear flows are dense in the set of solutions of the incompressible euler equations .",
    "furthermore , these wrinkled solutions can be arranged as a time - sequence of solutions which render the initial value problem for the evolving manifold to have an infinite number of constant energy solutions . in  8 ,",
    "a short discussion is provided to show that many of our earlier results for the incompressible euler equations carry over to the compressible case .",
    "based on the knowledge that has been obtained from the fluid equations , we show in  9 how the case of general continuum mechanics can be placed in our mechanics - geometry framework .",
    "as an illustrative example , we demonstrate results for elastodynamic motion of a neo - hookean solid . finally ,",
    "our last section ,  10 , provides a discussion of admissibility criteria for the ( incompressible and compressible ) euler equations which asserts that , for the multidimensional euler equations , no dynamic admissibility condition would eliminate _ wild _ solutions , and hence the only meaningful one must be the one which eliminates or at least reduces the number of wrinkles of our dual geometric problem . furthermore , these results suggest that more refined continuum mechanical theories relying on micro - structure could play a key role in choosing admissible solutions .",
    "we start with some basic geometric equations and notations for subsequent developments . for more details , see han - hong @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "let @xmath6 be a two - dimensional riemannian manifold with @xmath10 denoting a point on the manifold , @xmath11 .",
    "the unit normal vector @xmath12 to the manifold is given by @xmath13 and the second fundamental form is @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 with @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "we will use the alternative version of the second fundamental form @xmath20 and recall that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gauss curvature , and @xmath23 is the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "furthermore , for notational simplicity , we henceforth drop the  ' \" superscript in the alternative version of the second fundamental form .",
    "then the codazzi equations are @xmath24,\\\\[1 mm ] \\gamma_{12}^{1 } = \\frac1{2\\det { { \\bf g}}}\\left[g_{22}(\\partial_{2}g_{11})-g_{12}(\\partial_{1}g_{22})\\right],\\\\[1 mm ] \\gamma_{22}^{1 } = \\frac1{2\\det { { \\bf g}}}\\left[g_{22}(2\\partial_{2}g_{21}-\\partial_{1}g_{22})-g_{12}(\\partial_{2}g_{22})\\right],\\\\[1 mm ] \\gamma_{11}^{2 } = \\frac1{2\\det { { \\bf g}}}\\left[-g_{12}(\\partial_{1}g_{11})+g_{11}(2\\partial_{1}g_{12}-\\partial_{2}g_{11})\\right],\\\\[1 mm ] \\gamma_{12}^{2 } = \\frac1{2\\det { { \\bf g}}}\\left[-g_{12}(\\partial_{2}g_{11})+g_{11}(\\partial_{1}g_{22})\\right],\\\\[1 mm ] \\gamma_{22}^{2 } = \\frac1{2\\det { { \\bf g}}}\\left[-g_{12}(2\\partial_{2}g_{21}-\\partial_{1}g_{22})+g_{11}(\\partial_{2}g_{22})\\right ] , \\end{cases } \\ee and the riemann curvature tensor is given by \\begin{equation}\\label{2.4-a } r_{iljk}=g_{lm}\\big(\\partial_{k}\\gamma_{ij}^{m } -\\partial_{j}\\gamma_{ik}^{m}+\\gamma_{ij}^{n}\\gamma_{nk}^{m } -\\gamma_{ik}^{n}\\gamma_{nj}^{m}\\big),\\ ] ] where we have used the einstein summation convention that the repeated indices are implicitly summed over in the terms , which will also be used from now on .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath25    with , we have gauss s theorem egregium for the gauss curvature . a convenient form is given by brioschi s formula : [ e24 ]    = & 12(*g*)^2    - _",

    "we recall the fundamental theorem of surface theory states that the solvability of the gauss - codazzi equations is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an isometric embedding , _",
    "i.e. _ , a simply connected surface @xmath26 which satisfies @xmath11",
    ". a convenient reference for the smooth version of the fundamental theorem is do carmo @xcite , while a non - smooth version can be found in mardare @xcite .",
    "the equations for the balance of linear momentum are [ e25 ]    _ 1(u^2+p)+_2(uv)=-_tu , + _ 1(uv)+_2(v^2+p)=-_tv ,    where the constant density @xmath27 is taken .",
    "the condition of incompressibility for constant density is then given by the equation : [ e26 ] _ 1u+_2v=0 .",
    "in addition , taking the divergence of equations and using the incompressibility condition , we have [ e27 ] _ 11(u^2 ) + 2_12(uv)+_22(v^2 ) = -p .      just as in chen - slemrod - wang @xcite , it is convenient to write the geometric equations in fluid variables",
    ". set [ e28 ] l = v^2+p , m =- uv , n = u^2+p .",
    "then the gauss equation becomes @xmath28 that is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this quadratic equation then gives [ e29 ] p=-12q^212 .",
    "this means that @xmath31 must be required .",
    "as it will be seen in the analysis below , this condition is always satisfied .",
    "we have just shown that @xmath32 can be written in fluid variables .",
    "now we can write  the fluid variables in terms of the geometric variables @xmath32 . to do this , simply substitute formula into to find @xmath33 write @xmath34 to see that @xmath35 , which yields that @xmath36",
    ". then we see @xmath37 and , using @xmath38 , @xmath39 this shows that the `` + '' sign must be chosen in the above formulas so that [ e210 ]    u^2=12(-(l - n)+ ) , + v^2=12((l - n)+ ) .",
    "note that the condition : @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , is equivalent to @xmath42 that is , @xmath43 which is always satisfied .",
    "thus , we have shown that @xmath44 are determined by @xmath32 , since @xmath45",
    "we now construct a _ dual _ solution , which simultaneously satisfies the incompressible euler equations and the gauss - codazzi equations of isometric embeddings .    as before ,",

    "then , if the system of six equations  and in the six unknowns @xmath48 is satisfied , it produces simultaneously a solution of both the gauss - codazzi equations and the incompressible euler equations .",

    "it is easy to check that the equations of balance of linear momentum for the neo - hookean constitutive assumption we are considering ( the first piola - kirchhoff stress is given by @xmath301 ) reduces to the linear , second order system : @xmath302 thus , for the assumed ansatz ( [ ex_ansatz ] ) , the image of the degenerate isometric embedding problem has produced special _",

    "clearly , these are not steady solutions on the reference configuration in general .",
    "thus , it is an interesting question to check whether any of these are _ exact _ steady solutions on the current configuration .    1 .",
    "the solutions generated in example [ elast_example ] correspond to @xmath303 .",

    "now we consider the other solution @xmath319 .",
    "@xmath320 so that @xmath321 then we have unsteadiness in the current configuration as well as the reference . note",
    "that this case corresponds to choosing the wrong sign in solutions to to correspond to solutions of .",
    "however , if we now choose the ansatz for the motion to be @xmath322 then it can be checked that again @xmath323 are both solutions to system , but now only solution @xmath324 works ( for obvious reasons by following the previous argument ) : @xmath325 then again @xmath326 thus , we have a steady field on the current configuration , while , on the reference , stress / velocity / position waves are moving from the bottom to the top .    while simple , it is important to appreciate that the generated exact solution in this extremely simple example can produce smooth analogs ( with continuous deformation gradient ) of the traveling wave profile shown in fig .",

    "the greater freedom that elastodynamics provides over elastostatics in producing microstructure can now be appreciated . while such deformations in elastostatics can only be produced with a multi - well energy function @xcite",

    "our intent here is to simply point out the greater freedom of displaying microstructure without any length scale in elastodynamics . by considering the case for ever smaller @xmath332 , it is also now perhaps easy to intuitively see why the wrinkled deformations of the isometric embedding problem may have a limiting status in elastodynamics , as the parameters @xmath327 and/or @xmath328 tend to zero .",
    "furthermore , it is an interesting question whether our elastodynamic model ( [ es2 ] ) corresponding to the degenerate isometric embedding also displays solutions that represent static and dynamic terminating lines of phase boundaries ( generalized disclinations ) and shear bands ( dislocations ) , ingredients of nature that may help to further understand physically the nature of the wrinkled embeddings from geometry . finally , it is important to recognize and accept that microstructure in solids is not about infinite refinement and , as is well - known , such scale - free deformations , no matter how exciting from the analytical point of view , are notoriously difficult to deal with practically in modeling endeavors ( following nature s guide , in some sense ) .",
    "thus , our considerations seem to point to the need for models that can represent both static , quasi - static ( _ i.e. _ , evolving microstructure in the absence of material inertia ) , as well as fully dynamic microstructures with in - built length scales and accounting for the dissipation due to microstructure evolution .",

    "since the dynamics of the wrinkled solutions shadowing the incompressible or compressible euler equations are completely reversible nash - kuiper solutions corresponding to the metric for the developable surface , the usual irreversible entropy admissibility criteria become useless as selection criteria .",

    "however , this contradicts the non-@xmath182 property of our nash - kuiper wrinkled solution .",
    "thus , the only possibility is that , for the navier - stokes equations , there is no fluid pre - image of the nash - kuiper wrinkled solutions .",
    "one may be tempted to discount the physical relevance of the nash - kuiper theorem outlined here and in the recent work in @xcite . on the other hand , as noted in chen - glimm @xcite and others ( _ cf_. @xcite ) , viscous fluid turbulence arises with the imposition of an external force , which overcomes the viscous dissipation .",
    "hence , it may be that the addition of an external force would indeed bring us back to the nash - kuiper - gromov turbulence scenario .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of defect microstructure like dislocations , phase and grain boundaries , triple junctions , and point defects in crystalline solids furnish a compelling physical argument for accepting / developing physically rigorous and practically computable models that account for the representation of microstructure , necessarily then not of infinite refinement and with a modicum of uniqueness in the predicted evolution of their fields . in analogy with a crumpled piece of paper that does not produce infinitely fine terminated folds and neither unfolds itself back to its original flat state ,",
    "perhaps the correct notion of admissibility is to move to augmented physical models of continuum defect dynamics involving extra kinematics representing the microscopic , and hence smoothed , dynamics of discontinuity surfaces , their terminating lines , and point singularities of the fields of the original macroscopic model ( like nonlinear elasticity and navier - stokes ) , while accounting for the energetics of these defects and the dissipation produced owing to their motion .",

    "considering , for the moment , the situation when the constitutive equation is independent of @xmath0 , this becomes a question of determining the metric , given the second fundamental form , such that an embedding exists in @xmath251 , which is the opposite of the isometric embedding problem that may be interpreted as the question of determining the second fundamental form , given a metric @xmath0 . at any rate , as some of our results show , this problem has a solution in many instances .",

    "based on this premise , the requirement of an embedding of @xmath0 in @xmath251 assumes a physical status replacing a separate constitutive equation for the evolution of @xmath0 that would be required for the mechanical problem otherwise .",
