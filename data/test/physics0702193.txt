    "the reconstruction of low @xmath3 charged and neutral hadrons ( yields , spectra and correlations ) is crucial to characterize the collective properties of the system produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc . in pp collisions ,",
    "the measurement of high @xmath3 observables also requires good understanding of the characteristics of the underlying event and backgrounds which are dominated by soft @xmath0 spectra  @xcite .    in cms ,",
    "the measurement of charged particle trajectories is achieved primarily using the silicon tracker with both pixels and strips , embedded in a 4 t magnetic field , and with geometric coverage over @xmath4 2.5 .",
    "the high granularity silicon pixel tracker consists of three barrel layers ( at about 4 , 7 and 11 cm radius ) and two endcap disks .",
    "there are about 66 million pixels with an area of 100 @xmath5 150 @xmath6 and a sensor thickness of 300 @xmath7 m .",
    "the strip part is a combination of single- and double - sided layers with ten barrel and nine forward layers on each side ( 9.3 million channels ) .",
    "the silicon tracker has excellent reconstruction performance for @xmath8 gev/@xmath1 : 95% efficiency for charged hadrons with high @xmath3 , better than 98% for muons in pp and pa collisions and around 75% for central pbpb  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction capabilities at lower @xmath3 are limited by the high magnetic field and effects of the detector material .",
    "in addition , in central aa collisions the high occupancy of the silicon strips makes the inclusion of these strips in charged particle tracking difficult  @xcite .",
    "using only silicon pixels allows the same analysis to be used for low multiplicity pp , pa and high multiplicity aa events .",
    "we have developed an improved tracking algorithm which reconstructs tracks down to 0.1 gev/@xmath1 , using just the three pixel layers , with the modified hit triplet finding and cleaning procedures described here .",
    "the track finding procedure starts by pairing two hits from different layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_multi ] ) . during the search for the third hit",
    ", the following requirements must be fulfilled : the track must come from the cylinder of origin ( given by its radius , half - length and position along the beam - line ) ; the @xmath3 of the track must be above the minimal value @xmath9 ; and the track must be able to reach the layer where the third hit may be located . in the small volume of the pixel detector",
    "the magnetic field is practically constant and the charged particles propagate on helices .",
    "the projection of a helix or a cylinder onto the transverse plane is a circle .",
    "each requirement defines a region of allowed track trajectories .",
    "they are enclosed by a pair of limiting circles which can be constructed using simple geometrical transformations .",
    "a third hit candidate is accepted if its position is within a region which takes into account the expected multiple scattering .",
    "more details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while high @xmath3 tracks are relatively clean , uncorrelated hit clusters can often be combined to form fake low @xmath3 tracks . however , a cluster contains more information than its position .",
    "the geometrical shape of the hit cluster depends on the angle of incidence of the particle : bigger angles will result in longer clusters .",
    "we can , thus , check whether the measured shape of the cluster is compatible with the predicted angle of incidence of the track ; if any of the hits in the triplet is not compatible , the triplet is removed from the list of track candidates .      the low @xmath0 reconstruction studies are based on 25  000 minimum bias pp events ( generated with pythia , with the default _ minimum bias _ settings ) , reconstructed with the modified hit triplet finding .",
    "the algorithm uses the standard cms settings , except for a much lower minimum @xmath3 ( 0.075  gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "the acceptances rise sharply with @xmath3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : acceff]-left ) , and become approximately flat above @xmath3 values around 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3  gev/@xmath1 , respectively for pions , kaons and protons . in the range @xmath10 , their averages are 0.88 ( pions ) , 0.85 ( kaons ) and 0.84 ( protons ) .",
    "also the reconstruction efficiencies rise sharply with @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : acceff]-right ) , and become nearly flat above @xmath3 values around 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4  gev/@xmath1 , respectively for pions , kaons and protons . in the range @xmath11 , the corresponding average reconstruction efficiencies are 0.90 , 0.90 and 0.86 .    , for tracks in the range @xmath12 , for pions ( circles ) , kaons ( triangles ) and ( anti)protons ( squares).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] , for tracks in the range @xmath12 , for pions ( circles ) , kaons ( triangles ) and ( anti)protons ( squares).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    without triplet cleaning , the fake rate is @xmath13  4% at @xmath14 and reaches 20% at @xmath15 . with cleaning ,",
    "the fake rate decreases very significantly ( by a factor of 10 ) , to around 0.5% and 2% at @xmath14 and @xmath16 , respectively . in the range @xmath12 ,",
    "the fake rate decreases steeply with @xmath3 , being about 4% at 0.1  gev/@xmath1 , @xmath13 1% at 0.16  gev/@xmath1 and at the per mil level for higher @xmath3 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : ptresol]-left shows , as a function of the generated @xmath3 and separately for pions , kaons and protons , the ratio between the reconstructed and the simulated @xmath3 ( `` bias '' ) .",
    "it is seen that the particles generated at low @xmath3 tend to be reconstructed with a slightly lower @xmath3 value , because of energy loss effects .",
    "this bias is negligible for high @xmath17 values but is quite significant for low momentum protons ( or antiprotons ) : a correction of almost 10% is needed for protons of @xmath18  gev/@xmath1 . figure  [ fig : ptresol]-right shows how the resolution of the reconstructed @xmath3 depends on the generated @xmath3 . while at high @xmath3 values the resolution is @xmath13  6% for all particles , at low @xmath3 the multiple scattering and energy straggling effects are more important and lead to significantly degraded resolutions , in particular for protons .     as a function of the simulated @xmath3 , in terms of `` bias '' ( left ) and resolution ( right ) , for pions ( circles ) , kaons ( triangles ) and ( anti)protons ( squares ) , in the range @xmath12.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of the simulated @xmath3 , in terms of `` bias '' ( left ) and resolution ( right ) , for pions ( circles ) , kaons ( triangles ) and ( anti)protons ( squares ) , in the range @xmath12.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the performance of the low @xmath3 reconstruction",
    "was studied under several running conditions .",
    "these studies are based on 25  000 minimum bias pp events ( pythia generator ) and on 25 central pbpb events ( hydjet generator ) with two multiplicity settings : total particle multiplicities 30000 ( `` central '' ) and 15  000 ( `` mid - central '' ) . in the pbpb case , the primary vertex of the event was determined first , with good precision , using high @xmath3 tracks . in a second step ,",
    "the cylinder of origin was centered on this vertex , with a small half - length of 0.1  cm . in order to further reduce the reconstruction rate of fake tracks ,",
    "the radius of the cylinder of origin was reduced to 0.1  cm .",
    "the reconstruction was made faster by increasing the minimum @xmath3 cut to 0.175  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency is shown in fig .",

    "the pion reconstruction efficiency in pbpb collisions is @xmath13  90% , only 5% smaller than in pp collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison]-right shows that the reconstruction rate of fake tracks falls steeply with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "it drops below 10% for @xmath18  gev/@xmath1 in high - luminosity pp collisions and for @xmath19  gev/@xmath1 in central pbpb collisions .     for tracks in the range @xmath12 , for minimum bias pp events ( squares ) and for central pbpb collisions ( circles ) .",

    "it was shown in the previous section that silicon detectors can detect charged particles with good position and momentum resolution .",
    "some weakly - decaying neutral particles ( v0s ) such as @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , have a sizeable probability to decay far from the primary event vertex ( @xmath23 = 2.68 and 7.89 cm for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "likewise , the silicon detectors can be used to reconstruct photons through their conversion to @xmath24 pairs in the material of the beam - pipe , silicon pixels and supports .",
    "the analysis presented here only uses charged particles reconstructed from pixel hit triplets , with a much wider cylinder of origin ( 3.0  cm ) .",
    "therefore , only neutral particles which decay up to the first pixel barrel layer can be found .",
    "considering their masses and @xmath3 distributions , about half of the produced @xmath20 and @xmath21 particles satisfy this condition .",
    "the search for v0 candidates reduces to the determination of the closest point between two helices , as described in detail in ref .",

    "[ fig : ph_k0s]-left .",
    "the @xmath25 distributions for v0s show an exponential behaviour , steeper for @xmath20 than for @xmath21 , reflecting their different @xmath23 values .",
    "the @xmath25 distribution for photons is completely different : the two peaks belong to the inner and outer silicon wafers of the first pixel barrel layer .",
