    "the permitted o lines at 1304 , 8446 , and 11287   are common features in agn ( active galactic nuclei ) and have been used to study the physical properties of blr ( broad - line region ) clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in the partial grotrian diagram of o atom in figure [ fig : energydiagram ] , the transition from the ground state @xmath3 to the excited state @xmath4 has an excitation energy whose wavelength is @xmath1 = 1025.77  , falling within the doppler core of ly@xmath5(1025.72  ) for gas at 10@xmath6 k. the excited state @xmath4 decays either back to the ground state , or by the emission of a @xmath111287 photon , to the intermediate excited state @xmath7 .",
    "the latter decays by a @xmath18446 photon to the lower excited state @xmath8 , which finally decays to the ground state by a @xmath11304 photon .",
    "if ly@xmath5 pumping is the dominant process of o line formation , the photon flux ratio of these three lines should be 1:1:1 , and the photon flux ratio , especially between o @xmath11304 and @xmath18446 , can be used as a reddening indicator ( @xcite ; @xcite ; rodrguez - ardila et al .",
    "it can also be expected that if the o line emission is dominated by ly@xmath5 pumping , the o line intensities should be used to measure the microturbulence parameter in blr clouds , because ly@xmath5 pumping would become more efficient in a larger microturbulent velocity field .",
    "several mechanisms that could modify the 1:1:1 photon flux ratio have been suggested , such as the collisional excitation of o @xmath18446 and the balmer continuum absorption of o @xmath11304 ( @xcite ) .",
    "rodrguez - ardila et al . ( 2002b ) found that in six of their seven low - luminosity agns , ly@xmath5 pumping is not the only mechanism responsible for the o line emission , and the 1:1:1 photon flux ratio is altered .",

    "1989 , 2000 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus not clear whether the properties of the o line emission found in low - luminosity agns can be applied to quasars .",
    "the o line emission in quasars would differ from those of nls1s , because it is generally considered that the gas density in blr clouds is higher in nls1s than in quasars , and thus the collisional processes are more dominant in nls1s ( baldwin et al .",

    "would also provide knowledge about the physical properties of the fe emitting region , since the fe and o lines are considered to be emitted in the same portion of blr clouds ( rodrguez - ardila et al .",
    "since fe emission is the strongest coolant in blr clouds , it would give an important clue to better understand the radiative mechanisms in blr gas .    in order to study the o line formation mechanism in quasars",

    "the nir spectrum of pg 1116 + 215 , covering 0.9  1.8@xmath9 , including the redshifted o @xmath18446 and o @xmath111287 lines , was obtained using the longslit of flamingos ( florida multi - object imaging near - ir grism observational spectrometer ; @xcite ) on the kpno ( kitt peak national observatory ) 2.1 m telescope on 2005 february 28 .",

    "the hst ( hubble space telescope ) ultraviolet spectrum of pg 1116 + 215 was observed on 1993 february 19 and 20 by using the fos ( faint object spectrograph ) with three gratings ( g130h , g190h , and g270h ) , which cover 1200  3200   in the observed frame .",
    "the integration times were 8724s for g130h , 1878s for g190h , and 751s for g270h .",

    "the total uncertainty in the flux calibration was less than 5% .      in order to correct the galactic reddening , we adopted @xmath13 = 0.095 @xmath12 0.015 mag from the extinction map of the milky way based on the far - infrared emission observed by iras and cobe / dirbe ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resolution of their extinction map is .",
    "de - reddening of our spectrum was performed by using a galactic extinction curve presented by @xcite .",

    ", the ratio became 2.70 .",
    "@xcite showed that the flux ratio of the broad components of h@xmath2 to h@xmath5 is h@xmath2/h@xmath5 = 2.97 @xmath12 0.36 for their 94 blue agn samples .",
    "these agn samples are considered to be free of intrinsic extinction . judging from h@xmath2/h@xmath5 of pg 1116 + 215 , which is similar to those of these blue agns ,",
    "the intrinsic extinction in pg 1116 + 215 appears to be little .",
    "it is widely known that seyferts and quasars are highly variable .",
    "since the observation dates of the uv and nir spectra are separated by more than 12 yrs , a possible variability effect should be carefully examined before comparing the o lines in the uv and nir wavelengths .",

    "= 12.96 @xmath12 0.03 mag was obtained for our observation .",
    "it is thus clear that pg 1116 + 215 varied its brightness by about 0.6 mag since the 2mass observation on 1998 february 2 . however , because the o lines are formed in the outermost portion of the blr , it is expected that their variability is sufficiently small to be ignored , even if the power - law continuum , which is supposed to be direct light from the central source , shows significant variability .",
    "in fact , a monitoring observation of the well - known variable seyfert ngc 5548 revealed that when the continuum varied its brightness by about three times , the mg line , which is emitted in the same region as the o lines , varied by less than 6% ( @xcite ) .",
    "these arguments suggest that the variability has little effect on the o line fluxes of our data .",

    "the three o lines are clearly detected .",
    "note that the signal - to - noise ratio of the nir spectrum at the wavelength range shorter than 1@xmath9 is low because of the aberration at the edge of the detector .",
    "the o @xmath111287 line flux , which is free from blending with other lines , was measured by integrating all counts above the estimated continuum level in the wavelength range between 1.319@xmath9 and 1.338@xmath9 in the observed frame .",
    "the line width was measured by fitting a single gaussian to the observed line .",
    "the fwhm of o @xmath111287 is 2000 @xmath12 200 km s@xmath11 , and significantly narrower than that of ly@xmath2 ( @xmath14 5500 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "rodrguez - ardila et al . (",
    "2002a ) showed that the line widths and profiles of fe , o , and ca in their nls1 samples are very similar , while they are significantly narrower than that of pa@xmath5 .",
    "their results are consistent with the fe , o , and ca lines occurring in the partly ionized regions , which are farther from the central ionizing source and have smaller velocities .",
    "our narrow o @xmath111287 line width relative to ly@xmath2 implies that this geometrical configuration found in the nls1s also applies to quasars .",
    "although o @xmath18446 is blended with the ca lines in the red wing , the blueward part of the line is almost free from its contamination .",
    "we thus fitted a single gaussian to the line in the blueward part where the contamination by ca is not severe , and then measured the flux within the fitted gaussian .",
    "the broad feature at 1304   results from the blending of an o triplet at @xmath11302.17 , @xmath11304.86 , and @xmath11306.0 and a si doublet at si @xmath11304 and @xmath11309 .",
    "the total blend flux of the @xmath11304 feature was measured by integrating all counts above the estimated continuum level between 1524   and 1548   in the observed frame .",
    "the o and si lines are severely blended and de - blending with high spectral resolution is hopeless for quasars .",
    "however , the si doublet blended in the 1304   feature is expected to be accompanied by considerable si line emission at 1264    ( @xcite ) . actually , si @xmath11264 is clearly detected in uv spectrum of pg 1116 + 215 ( figure [ fig : spectra ] ) and its flux is 44 @xmath12 5% of the blend flux of the 1304   feature .",
    "the photoionization models by @xcite and @xcite predict that the si doublet at 1304   and 1309   has 16  28% of the flux of si @xmath11264 ( @xcite ) , implying that 7  12% of the blend flux comes from the si doublet and 88  93% from the o triplet .",

    "this suppression of c ] @xmath11909 is also seen in other narrow - line quasars ( baldwin et al .",
    "1988 , 1996 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the high density of the blr gas is common in this type of agn . however , it is not clear whether these arguments are applicable to the region where fe and o lines are emitted .",

    "since the fe and o lines are considered to be formed in the same region as the mg line ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the physical properties in the fe emitting region could be quite different from the c ] emitting region .",

    "as described above , there are no significant differences in @xmath20 and @xmath19 among the nls1s , the seyfert 1 , and the quasar .",

    "nls1s are known as strong fe emitters .",
    "the efficiency of fe emission is sensitive to several physical parameters other than the gas density , in which the most sensitive parameters are the ionization parameter , microturbulence , and input spectral energy distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; verner et al . 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "our results suggest that the fe emission enhancement in the nls1s may not be caused by the high density of the blr gas",

    "<S> by observing the near - infrared spectrum of the quasar pg 1116 + 215 at @xmath0 and combining with the hst / fos spectrum , we obtained the relative strengths of three permitted o lines ( @xmath11304 , @xmath18446 , and @xmath111287 ) in a quasar for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the photon flux ratios of the o lines of the quasar were compared with those previously measured in a seyfert 1 and six narrow - line seyfert 1s . </S>",
    "<S> no significant differences were found in the o line flux ratios between the quasar and the other seyferts , suggesting that the gas density in the o and fe line - emitting regions in the quasar is of the same order as those in low - luminosity agns . </S>",
    "<S> it was also found that the line width of o @xmath111287 is significantly narrower than that of ly@xmath2 , which is consistent with o and fe emission occurring in the partly ionized regions at the outermost portion of the broad - line region where velocities are small . </S>"
