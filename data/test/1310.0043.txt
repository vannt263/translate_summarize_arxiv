    "colloidal gels are components of everyday products such as foodstuffs , fabric conditioners , cosmetics , shampoos , and even toothpaste , yet despite their practical importance they present many challenges to our understanding of disordered materials .",
    "a gel is a solid containing a network of particles which is formed when a colloidal dispersion with attractive interactions @xmath0 is quenched deep into a two - phase region of phase space @xcite .",
    "driven far out - of - equilibrium , the kinetics of phase separation are dramatically slowed down or , in the limit of strong short - range attractions ( @xmath1 with @xmath2 the range of the attractive interactions and @xmath3 the particle radius ) , totally arrested .",
    "partial phase separation generates a disordered network , whose initial structure is controlled by the strength of interaction @xmath0 , the range @xmath4 of the potential , as well as the volume fraction @xmath5 of colloids .",
    "the long - time structural integrity of this network is , in the majority of cases , constrained by the gravitational stress exerted by its own weight . given sufficient time , a gel settles under gravity , if it is not density - matched .",
    "we distinguish two limiting cases : in strong gels , where the attractive interactions are large in magnitude ( @xmath6 and narrow in range @xmath1 ) , compaction occurs smoothly at a rate which decreases progressively with time .",
    "the time dependence of the height of the gel in this case is well described by a poroelastic settling model @xcite ; by contrast , in weak gels where attractions are comparable to @xmath7 and wide in range @xmath8 so that thermal fluctuations are significant , an anomalous behaviour called _ delayed collapse _ is observed . a weak gel , instead of instantaneously settling , hesitates for a well defined delay period @xmath9 without any sign of macroscopic settling , before suddenly undergoing a rapid and catastrophic collapse .",
    "delayed collapse has been observed in a wide variety of systems @xcite so the response appears to be a universal feature of weak gels yet to - date no theoretical framework has emerged to account for this process .",
    "the existence of a measurable delay in the collapse of a weak colloidal gel looks , at first sight , rather surprising . in",
    "a crystalline solid yield usually happens spontaneously at a well defined stress and there is no latency before the material flows .",
    "similarly , if a constant gravitational stress is applied to a free - flowing colloidal suspension sedimentation occurs essentially instantaneously .",
    "the anomalous response evident in a weak gel has been interpreted as the signature of a non - equilibrium solid - to - fluid transition , triggered by erosion of the gel network by internal flows @xcite , progressive fracture by an applied gravitation stress @xcite , or as a consequence of thermal restructuring of the network @xcite .",
    "the origins of delayed collapse are both scientifically fascinating as well as being technologically relevant because colloidal gels are often used to stabilize complex product formulations against macroscopic phase separation .",
    "the network of particles supports the gravitational stress exerted by the formulation and suppresses unwanted sedimentation of the product .",
    "this trick , widely used by formulators , works only for @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the age of the gel ) as the gel instability at @xmath9 eventually restores equilibrium and phase separation starts again .",
    "in such cases , @xmath9 fixes the ultimate physical self - life of the product .",
    "a demand for robust long - life formulations has heightened the need for a better microscopic understanding of the process of delayed collapse so that gel instability may be predicted and controlled .",
    "much of the work to date on gel collapse has focused on macroscopic features , typically by measuring the time evolution of the height @xmath12 of a gel , rather than on the internal structure and dynamics of a gel . however in the last few years new techniques , such as confocal scanning microscopy @xcite and photon correlation imaging @xcite has revealed that colloidal gels have a complex hierarchical structure , with different structural features at different length scales .",
    "so while at the individual particle level , a gel consists of dense aggregated colloids , the aggregates are organized on the micro - scale into relatively thick strands of particles , which at the mesoscale are assembled into a percolating network able to transmit a stress . in a weak gel ,",
    "the stress bearing network has a number of distinctive characteristics .",
    "first , it is mechanically heterogeneous with a complex structure consisting of weakly connected soft regions of low particle density coexisting with stiff dense strands of spheres .",
    "the strands of the gel may be several radii thick , depending on the strength and range of the attractive interactions .",
    "second , the network is dynamic and restructures with time , as inter - particle bonds break and reform via thermal fluctuations .",
    "a microscopic understanding of just how such a spatially and temporally disordered network evolves in time and how it transmits stress is still elusive yet just such an insight is essential for the prediction and control of delayed collapse .",
    "the goal of this paper is to summarize the key features of delayed collapse in weak depletion gels , to speculate on their origins , and to identify the key issues that still remain to be resolved .",
    "we briefly review the features of delayed collapse seen in the gravitational settling of weak gels . with a few recent exceptions",
    ", the majority of the previous work reported to date has focused on macroscopic features such as the time evolution of the height of a gel .",
    "we discuss the microscopic changes in the gel as it restructures by the breaking and reforming of inter - particle bonds . using this experimental insight , we propose a new model for delayed collapse which emphasises the connectivity of the stress - transmitting network .",
    "finally , we explore the role of an external applied force on the delay time of a gel and interpret the results in light of the new model .",

    "we focus on the time - dependent evolution of the total height @xmath12 of a gel in a gravitational field , as a function of its age @xmath11 .",
    "typically a suspension is randomized by shaking or mixing at time @xmath25 and then left undisturbed during the sedimentation process .",
    "the height @xmath12 usually displays three regimes @xcite : an initial lag period of width @xmath9 where the height falls slowly but continuously with age , a non - linear regime of rapid collapse where the interface velocity @xmath26 speeds up with @xmath11 , and finally a region of compaction where the height relaxes asymptotically towards an equilibrium value .",
    "the three - stage nature of delayed collapse is exemplified by the data reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](a ) on the settling of depletion gels @xcite with @xmath15 for polymer concentrations @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we use two sizes of low polydispersity surfactant - stabilized poly(dimethyl siloxane ) ( pdms ) emulsion droplets suspended in a refractive - index and near - density matched mixture of 1,2-ethane diol and water .",
    "the suspension of large droplets had a hydrodynamic radius of @xmath28 nm and a polydispersity of 0.17 while the small droplets had a radius of @xmath29 nm and a polydispersity of 0.18 .",
    "a depletion attraction was induced by the addition of either the anionic polyelectrolyte xanthan ( @xmath30 = 4.66 x 10@xmath31 g mol@xmath32 , radius of gyration @xmath33 nm ) or neutral hydroxyethylcellulose ( @xmath30 = 1.3 x 10@xmath31 g mol@xmath32 , radius of gyration @xmath34 nm ) depending on the range of attractions required .",
    "the majority of experiments were conducted using a combination of large emulsion droplets and xanthan to give a colloid - polymer mixture with an attractive range of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a small number of results were obtained using a colloid - polymer mixture with an attractive range of @xmath36 @xcite , obtained by combining small emulsion droplets with hydroxyethylcellulose .",
    "the magnitude of the attractions between droplets was adjusted by varying the concentration @xmath16 of added polymer , which is expressed in units of the overlap concentration @xmath37 .",
    "the relative buoyancy of the emulsion droplets is @xmath38 kg m@xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 the densities of the droplet and solvent mixture respectively .",
    "this relatively small density difference explains the absence , evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](a ) , of any discernible settling during the lag phase .",
    "this is in contrast to many of the earlier studies where the initial stages of gel settling were often characterized by a relatively broad change in the height around @xmath42 as the gel was already settling slowly before the regime of rapid collapse started .",
    "this makes it more difficult to identify precisely the point where rapid collapse starts . in the pdms system",
    "it is straight - forward to determine the characteristic delay time @xmath9 , which is taken as the time at which the height @xmath12 of the gel first begins to noticeably drop from its initial value @xmath43 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the physical and chemical factors that determine the duration @xmath9 of this initial lag period .",
    "experiments reveal @xcite that the characteristic delay time @xmath9 has a number of distinctive characteristics : first , measurements of @xmath9 from samples of identical materials display a significant statistical variance @xcite ; and second , the average delay time @xmath22 is very sensitive to the magnitude of the attractive interactions _ i.e. _ doubling the polymer concentration in a depletion system may increase the delay time by 12 orders of magnitude @xcite . figures  [ fig : mockup](b ) and ( c ) confirms the generality of these conclusions in the pdms system . to establish the extent of statistical variations in the delay time",
    ", we performed 116 repeat measurements of the delay time on a depletion gel @xcite with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 nm ) in a temperature controlled environment with @xmath44 .",
    "each of the runs was made on a freshly - prepared gel sample under identical conditions to ensure that individual runs were uncorrelated .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath9 were used to construct the probability distribution @xmath17 of delay times shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](b ) . an appreciable variation in the measured delay times",
    "is seen with a scatter of about 14 % .",
    "the distribution @xmath17 is symmetric and well fitted by a gaussian distribution ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](b ) ) which suggests that delayed collapse is a consequence of a large number of independent uncorrelated stochastic events .",
    "a clue to the nature of the stochastic events responsible for delayed collapse is revealed by the strong correlation evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](c ) between the mean delay time @xmath22 and the lifetime @xmath24 of an individual colloid - colloid bond . to estimate the bond lifetime",
    "we assume that the rupture of individual bonds occurs primarily as a consequence of thermal fluctuations and that the gravitational stress ( which as noted above is small in the pdms system ) does not significantly accelerate the rate of bond rupture .",
    "when no force is applied across the bond , the lifetime @xmath24 may then be expressed in terms of the average time it takes a brownian particle to diffuse out of the attractive potential ( the kramers escape time ) . in the limit of @xmath45 ,",
    "the lifetime is given by the arrhenius expression , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a characteristic time which depends on the colloid diffusivity and the range and depth of the interaction potential .",
    "estimating @xmath47 from the measured low shear rheology , and the width @xmath48 and depth @xmath0 of the depletion potential from accurate generalised free - volume theories @xcite yields the lifetimes plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](c ) .",
    "as may be seen , the ratio of the two characteristic times is very nearly constant , for a wide range of polymer concentrations , with the delay time approximately 240 times the bond lifetime .",
    "the strong correlation evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : mockup](c ) highlights the pivotal role of spontaneous thermal fluctuations .",
    "the observation that delayed collapse occurs on timescales two orders of magnitude larger than the bond rupture time indicates that a microscopic particle - level model is inadequate to account for collapse .",
    "the large difference between @xmath22 and @xmath24 highlights the crucial role played by the hierarchical structure of a gel .",
    "the characteristic ratio @xmath49 is also likely to depend on the initial volume fraction @xmath50 of the gel but this dependence has , to date , been little studied experimentally .",
    "the delay time , in addition to its sensitivity to the interaction potential and the particle volume fraction @xmath50 , has also been reported to depend on physical factors such as the height , width , and the cross - sectional shape of the sample cell @xcite .",
    ", for instance , observed that weak depletion gels constructed from poly(methyl methacrylate ) spheres with initial heights @xmath43 above 7 mm , showed a height - independent delay time @xcite .",
    "however in one sample with @xmath51 mm there was a marked increase in the delay time by a factor of about 70% .",
    "evans and starrs @xcite interpreted these observations as evidence for the existence in a gel of a new macroscopic length scale @xmath52 , which they termed a ` stress transmission length ' .",
    "they argued that samples whose height @xmath43 were greater than @xmath52 could not transmit gravitational stress to the base of a sample so no properties of the gel could be a function of @xmath43 . aside from this study , the effect of height on gel collapse has not been systematically studied although kim _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and others have noted a qualitative change in settling with short samples generally showing a steady or ` creeping sedimentation ' while delayed collapse seemed only to be shown by tall samples .",
    "interpretation of these observations is complicated by the relatively small range of initial heights used , but suggest that collapse phenomena might show a rich dependence on the initial height .    to clarify the effect of height on collapse , we used two complementary measurement techniques to probe the delay process in the pdms system over a wide range of initial heights .",
    "for relatively tall samples ( @xmath53 mm ) a ccd camera was used to measure accurately the time dependence of the height , @xmath12 , of the gel with a spatial resolution of about 0.5 mm . in short samples",
    "the collapse kinetics was followed by confocal scanning laser microscopy .",
    "the gels were repeatedly imaged by scanning a large number ( @xmath54 ) of slices perpendicular to the gravitational field at different time intervals ( from minutes to days ) .",
    "the fluorescent intensity in each slice was integrated to give a height profile .",

    "these observations confirm the conclusions of the more limited set of height - data ( @xmath55 mm ) reported in @xcite .",
    "the independence of @xmath9 on @xmath43 is particularly striking because the initial height of the gel was varied over almost two orders in magnitude , from 0.78 mm to 63 mm .",

    "dissociation is an activated process which requires particles to escape from a deep potential well and so is not expected to depend on the age of the sample . while , the decline in the rate of association with @xmath11 reflects the progressive slowing down of the microscopic dynamics frequently seen in soft glassy systems as they evolve towards a more homogeneous state @xcite .",
    "the second distinctive feature of figure  [ fig : aging - events ] is the dominance at early times of association over dissociation events .",
    "the data reveals that dissociation is a relatively rare event and a strand once broken will be almost immediately reformed by an association event so that the connectivity of the network changes only very slowly with @xmath11 .",
    "the network is essentially self - healing and reforms rapidly after any deformation . at longer times , the character of the network changes as the rates of association and dissociation become comparable . at this point the connectivity of the network drops rapidly with increasing age .",

    "the subsequent lose of connectivity of the network and the eventual failure of the gel is rapid by comparison , and so can safely be neglected .",
    "motivated by the experimental data presented above , we assume that the rate @xmath67 at which a gel strand breaks is time - independent while @xmath66 , the rate at which the strands of the network associate and re - form , depends on the age of the gel . while the quench history of the gel , and its chemistry will , in general have a significant impact on the time dependence of @xmath71 , close to the vicinity of the collapse point the data in fig .",

[ eqn : model ] may be re - expressed as @xmath114\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 . from the data presented in fig .",

    "a non - linear least - squares fit of eq .",
    "[ eqn : model - fit ] , with @xmath118 , to the experimental data ( shown as the solid line in figure  [ fig : potential](b ) ) yields a good representation of the experimental force distribution .",
    "the best - fit parameters were determined as @xmath119 s and @xmath120 pn . to interpret these values , we note that for @xmath121 nm the characteristic thermal rupture force is @xmath122 pn so the number of bonds in the equivalent linear force chain is @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath112 should be comparable to the number of particle bonds between magnetic beads which is @xmath125 or @xmath126 30 , in the current experiments .",
    "this value is indeed comparable to the force chain length found experimentally of @xmath124 , which is very reassuring .",
    "overall , the force measurements provide reasonably strong support for the microscopic model of gel collapse outlined above .",
    "while more work clearly needs to be done , these initial observations strengthen our argument that a catastrophic loss of connectivity as a consequence of thermally - driven dissociation events is ultimately responsible for delayed collapse .",

    "the force @xmath109 counteracts the buoyancy force acting on the gel so the delay time @xmath9 of the gel is increased .",

    "it is useful to briefly summarize what features of the collapse instability in depletion gels are well understood and what is still left to be clarified .",
    "delayed collapse , whereby a gel which is initially sedimentating slowly after a certain time interval ( the _ delay _ time ) switches to a regime of rapid collapse , is well established in systems with long - range attractive potentials . in this paper",
    "we have focused predominately on such long - range systems .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these gels is that when quenched into a two - phase region the particle network coarsens continuously with time , as a result of thermal breaking and reforming of interparticle bonds .",
    "in contrast , the sedimentation kinetics of depletion gels with short - range attractive potentials is more complex , as a result of the interplay between phase separation and dynamical arrest @xcite , and is not as well understood .",
    "finally , we note that the initial particle density is likely to have a significant effect on the time evolution of a gel but the effect of @xmath50 has to date been little studied .",
    "the delay time @xmath9 , which can vary from minutes to months , has been reported to depend on the depth and range of the attractive potential , the volume fraction @xmath5 , the particle radius @xmath129 , the density mismatch @xcite , the presence of a weak shear stress @xcite , and even the width and height of the sample cell @xcite .",
    "the link between these effects and the microstructure of a gel is in many cases currently missing .",
    "however the pivotal role of the thermal lifetime of a single particle - particle bond , the kramers escape time @xmath24 , is generally recognized @xcite .",
    "experiments confirm , for instance , that the time required for gel collapse scales approximately linearly with the escape time , over some two orders of magnitude of variation in @xmath9 .",
    "the large value of the ratio @xmath130 , which for the data presented here is of order @xmath131 , highlights the significant role the hierarchical structure of a gel plays in the connection between a local bond dissociation event and the eventual overall failure of the network .",
    "time - resolved confocal imaging experiments indicate that , although the gel is continuously coarsening , the most important feature of the thermal restructuring is probably a decrease in connectivity of the network with time .",
    "analysis of the association and dissociation dynamics of strands within the gel suggest that collapse is triggered when the rate of strand association , which is a decreasing function of time , decreases to such an extent that it becomes comparable to the fixed rate of strand dissociation . at this point ,",
    "the ability of the gel network to support a gravitational stress decreases rapidly and the gel soon afterwards fails macroscopically .",
    "this microscopic picture of collapse is supported by preliminary measurements on the effect of an applied point force on the dynamics of collapse . more work on the subtle link between delayed collapse , microscopic dissociation dynamics , and applied force",
    "is however essential to fully understand the anomalous mechanical response of weak gels . particularly puzzling",
    "is the role of gravitational stress .",
    "the absence of any variation of the delay time with the height of a gel seems , at first sight , to be at variance with the results of the magnetic experiments where @xmath9 increases with applied force .",
    "work is under way to address this intriguing question .",
