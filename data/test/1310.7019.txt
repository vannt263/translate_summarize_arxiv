    "in semiconductor systems based on the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) the linear conductance is determined by the scattering properties of the fermi level wave functions.@xcite since relatively recently the electron transport properties can be probed with a local perturbation introduced to 2deg by the charge probe at the atomic force microscope tip,@xcite used as a floating gate .",

    "the spatial distribution of the pointer states was extracted by post - treatment of the conductance images as obtained by scanning gate microscopy.@xcite    in this work we consider a purely coherent electron transport .",
    "our purpose is to determine an extent to which the details of the local density of states @xcite at the fermi level can be extracted from the raw conductance maps gathered with the charge perturbation scanning the surface of the structure .",
    "the original tip potential as seen by the 2deg is of the long range coulomb form .",

    "modeling the tip potential is assumed short - range in a form given by a closed formula.@xcite for 2deg which is not confined laterally @xcite the deformation of the electron gas follows the tip as it scans the surface and the effective ( screened ) tip potential preserves its form . on the other hand in systems with lateral confinement  in the cavity in particular ",
    "the 2deg deformation can not freely follow the tip , so a local form of the effective potential can only be an approximation of the actual potential . in this work the effective potential of the tip",
    "is evaluated by solving the density functional theory equations.@xcite we find that the tip potential is close to lorentzian which for small 2deg - tip distance is isotropic outside the edges of the cavity and of the width which is close to the tip-2deg distance .    we demonstrate that the resolution of the local density of states at the fermi with the charge probe technique depends on the work point defined by the electron density .",
    "the local density of states is highly correlated to conductance maps when the fermi energy level enters into fano resonance with states localized within the cavity . outside the resonances the maps calculated for weak tip potentials agree with the lipmann - schwinger perturbation theory @xcite but are not correlated in a clear way with the local density of states .",

    "the potential becomes anisotropic when the tip approaches the edges of the cavity due to the anisotropy of the screening medium .",
    "an extreme anisotropy is reached for the tip above the edge : the potential is strongly elongated along the edge , it weakly penetrates the cavity [ cf .",
