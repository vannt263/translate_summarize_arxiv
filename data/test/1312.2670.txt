    "notwithstanding the universal attractive nature of gravity , the universe appears to be going through an accelerated phase of expansion .",
    "this strange behaviour has strong observational evidence@xcite and is a widely accepted reality .",
    "the acceleration is reported to be a recent affair , started well within the matter dominated regime@xcite . that this acceleration has set in after a long stint of decelerated exapnsion is a theoretical requirement as well@xcite .",
    "but the matter that drives this acceleration is still a mystery , which is neither detected observationally nor has any single firmly accepted theoretical model .",
    "a rejuvenated introduction of the cosmological constant @xmath0 does very well in explaining this recent acceleration , but @xmath0 has its own problems@xcite . amongst a host of alternatives ,",
    "a quintessence field@xcite attracts a lot of attention . a scalar field , minimally coupled to gravity , endowed with a potential ,",
    "is called a quintessence fi eld .",
    "the idea is that the potential may give an effective negative pressure which would result in providing the required anti - gravity effect and thus drive an accelerated expansion .",
    "however there is no indication of a clear verdict in favour of a potential in terms of a theoretical basis .",
    "along with the problem of finding a suitable driver ( generally called a dark energy ) of the present acceleration , the associated problem that crops up is that why at the present epoch this dark energy bears a constant ratio , of order unity , to the dark matter .",
    "the cosmological constant , if that is the solution to the dark energy problem , should be extremely fine tuned to the density of matter or radiation at the very early stage@xcite .",
    "+ thus there are two problems , one is the absence of a sound theoretical basis in favour of any particular quintessence potential , and the other is that of a fine tuning of initial values . there is no serious remedy for the first one .",
    "attempts have been made to model the acceleration with an arbitrary potential using two scalar fields@xcite .",
    "+ one way to address the second problem is to look for a quintessence field which ` tracks ' the matter density , i.e. evolves at almost the same rate but below the level of the dark matter but slowly catches up so as to eventually lead the scenario only at a later stage @xcite .",
    "+ naturally there has been a lot of work in this direction , where the quintessence field is a tracker .",
    "johri @xcite looked for quintessence potentials which are trackers .",
    "urena - lopez etal @xcite gave a tracker solution which acts as a quintessence .",
    "sahlen , liddle and parkinson reconstructed a quintessence potential and checked its tracking viability @xcite . in order to resolve the coincidence problem , dodelson , kaplinghat and stewart @xcite invoked an oscillating potential as the quintessence field .",
    "wang , chen and chen @xcite discussed the performance of some tracker field quintessence potentials against observational data .",
    "they found that tracker potentials of the form @xmath1 or [ @xmath2 are clearly unsuitable .",
    "+ the primary motivation of the present work is to find the stability of the solutions for frw cosmological models with a pressureless fluid and a tracking quintessence field .",
    "the field equations are written as an autonomous system , and the fixed points are located .",
    "the fixed points which correspond to the physical requirements of the evolution of the universe are picked up .",
    "actually only one generic fixed point could be obtained , which depends on the equation of state parameter @xmath3 for the fluid and the fractional rate of decrease of the quintessence potential .",
    "attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology and some of their applications in an inflationary scenario and also in the quintessence scenario have also been discussed by ng , nunes and rosati @xcite . + albeit its being not so extensively used , a dynamical systems analysis is not new in cosmology .",
    "we refer to the volume edited by ellis and wainwright and work of coley for reviews @xcite .",
    "lara and castagnino @xcite presented a dynamical systems analysis for an frw universe with a number of non minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "gunzig et al @xcite discussed a spatially flat frw universe with a scalar field .",
    "the motivation was to to look at the nature of the scalar field solutions leading to an inflation at an early epoch .",
    "carot and collinge also discussed inflationary scalar field cosmologies in the frame work of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "a scalar field leading to a phantom behaviour had been studied by urena - lopez @xcite . in the framework of dynamical systems , brans - dicke theory and also its equivalnce with a minimally coupled scalar field",
    "have also been discussed@xcite .",
    "+ in section 2 , the einstein field equations for a spatially flat frw universe with a scalar field and a pressureless fluid are written as an autonomous system of equations and the relevant fixed points are found out .",
    "section 3 deals with the stability of the solution .",
    "section 4 deals with two specific examples of scalar potentials which can actually drive the present acceleration starting from a decelerated phase .",
    "a discussion of the results obtained is given in section 5 .",
    "for a spatially flat robertson walker universe , given by the metric @xmath4 filled with a perfect fluid and also a scalar field distribution , einstein field equations are written as @xmath5 and @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the hubble parameter , @xmath8 is the energy density of the perfect fluid given by the equation of state @xmath9,where @xmath3 is a constant , @xmath10 is the scalar field and @xmath11 is the scalar potential .",

    ", we shall assume a  near tracking \" situation i.e @xmath30 , which leads to ( via equation (  [ eq.lambda ] ) ) @xmath34 i.e. @xmath35 is nearly a constant .",

    "amongst all the possibilities , the extreme cases like @xmath46 ( meaning @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 ( meaning @xmath49 ) are excluded .",
    "the intention is obviously to have a blend of the quintessence matter and the dark matter . as r is a radial coordinate ranging between 0 and @xmath50",
    ", we also exclude the fixed point solution of @xmath51 .",
    "the only viable option as fixed point is then @xmath52 . in terms of the old variables",

    "let us consider the system of equations + @xmath55 + and @xmath56 , + where an overhead dot denotes differentiation with respect to some parameter ( @xmath57 in the present case ) .",
    "+ if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the small disturbances from the fixed points then the system can be linearised in the form + @xmath60     + where @xmath61 is called jacobian matrix at the fixed point .",
    "the stability of a fixed point can be determined from the determinant ( @xmath62 ) and trace ( @xmath63 ) of a at that fixed point . if @xmath64 , the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs hence the fixed point is a saddle point .",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath66 then both the eigenvalues have negative real part hence the fixed point is stable . when @xmath65 and @xmath67 then the fixed point is unstable .",

    "we consider @xmath74 , the matter dominated era with @xmath75 .",
    "it is known that the fixed point is stable only when @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "so @xmath78 is the condition for which the fixed point is stable . to draw the phase portrait of the system ,",
    "we have plotted r against @xmath79 instead of that against @xmath80 . from the phase plot(figure:1 ) it is clear that the fixed point is stable in nature which we have also got from the analytical analysis .",
    "so any solution of the system around this fixed point will be a stable solution for a wide range of initial values .",
    "+ the phase plot shows that @xmath81 is an invariant submanifold and so is @xmath82 . in the second , however , one should note that ( @xmath83 ) is a saddle type fixed point for our choice of parameters ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "it deserves mention that a local subspace bounded by invariant submanifolds given by @xmath82 , @xmath81 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 has been considered .",
    "the reason for restricting to values of @xmath88 not more than one is the physical requirement that @xmath89 indeed lies between 0 and 1 .     and @xmath90.,width=377 ]",
