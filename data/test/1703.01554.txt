    "neutrino oscillation experiments suggest that the masses of the three type neutrinos ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) are different , however , only two squared mass differences of them are obtained , instead of the absolute masses @xcite .",
    "the solar oscillation experiments determined the squared difference of mass @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath13 , and another squared difference @xmath14 has been measured from the oscillations of neutrinos produced in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "therefore , we have two type of mass hierarchy : the normal hierarchies ( nh , @xmath15 ) and the inverted hierarchies ( ih , @xmath16 ) .",
    "moreover , the oscillation probabilities depend only on squared mass differences , @xmath17 , which are not sensitive to the absolute value of neutrino masses , then the three masses may have the following relationships .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the ih case may be @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , the case that @xmath24 is possible , too .",
    "thus , the determination of absolute mass scale of neutrinos is a great challenge in experimental particle physics .",
    "fortunately , cosmological observations can provide some important information in studying the neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "massive neutrinos are initially relativistic , but they become nonrelativistic so late that they can influence the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies via the early - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite , and modify the growth of structure in the universe via suppress the clustering of matter .",
    "quantitatively , the suppression of the matter power spectrum on the small scales due to neutrino free streaming is roughly given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is related to the hubble constant by @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "such an effect can be clearly visible in the large scale structure ( lss ) measurements . for the neutrinos have a great impact on the cmb and lss",
    ", then one can extract useful signals of cosmic neutrinos from the matter clustering , the polarization observations of cmb @xcite , and the cross correlation between the rees - sciama effect and weak lensing @xcite , etc .    beside neutrinos",
    ", the standard model of cosmology suggests that most of the universe is made up of a component with negative pressure , i.e. dark energy ( de ) . in this model",
    ", de is the component drives the universe to accelerate expansion @xcite . until now",
    ", there are so many de models had been raised up to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the universe , but the nature of de remains to be clarified . among them ,",
    "the most simplest one is the @xmath3cdm model , whose equation of state ( eos ) is @xmath29 .",
    "though the @xmath3cdm model can fit various latest data quite well , it always beset with the severe theoretical changes @xcite .",
    "therefore , to see whether the eos of de is equal to @xmath30 is extremely important .    since neutrinos and de are all mysteries that we do not know clearly in the universe and they both have great influences on the evolution of the universe , then considering them together is needed . a stringent upper bounds on the total neutrino mass , i.e. @xmath31 ev ( @xmath32 ) has been provided by",
    "2015 @xcite , using the dataset _",
    "tt , te , ee+lowp+bao and the base @xmath3cdm model",
    ". however , the constraint on the masses of neutrinos is strongly depends on the nature of the de component of the universe .",
    "just as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author studied the influence of a dynamical de model with free ( but constant ) eos parameter , i.e. @xmath1cdm model , on the neutrino masses , and the work provided that massive neutrinos can be degenerated with the de density and the eos .",
    "so if a dynamical de is considered , the constraints of the neutrinos mass could be modified significantly . for the @xmath1cdm model the upper bound of the neutrinos total mass will be relaxed , but tighter in the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model @xcite .",
    "the previous studies have not taken the neutrino mass hierarchies into consideration , once it is considered , the nh is slightly favored than ih @xcite . moreover , the same conclusion for the @xmath1cdm and hde model are obtained but with tighter limits upper limit of @xmath4 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will following the ideas raised in @xcite , in which the authors treat nh and ih in a unique parameter , unlike the former works where nh and ih are treated separately , we have focued on impacts of two dynamical de models in distinguishing the nh and ih , and constraining of @xmath4 by using the recent cosmological observations .",
    "one of the de models considered in this study is the @xmath1cdm model , comparing to the @xmath3cdm model it has one more free parameter , i.e. , its eos @xmath33 is a free constant to be determined .",
    "the other one is the cpl model , whose eos is given by @xmath34 , it is time - varying and has two free parameters @xcite .",
    "although the cpl model has an extra free parameter to be determined , it is more general than the hde model , for that it has nothing to do with any derived parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : datmet ] , we briefly review the method of formulating the neutrino mass hierarchy parameter and the cosmological datasets used in this paper . constrainting results on the neutrino mass parameter and different de models are shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is our conclusions .",
    "taking the differences of neutrinos mass squares with three massive eigenstates into account and neglecting the experimental uncertainties , two independent parameters are given as @xcite @xmath35 following the method raised in @xcite , by introducing a parameter , i.e. , @xmath36 , the three neutrino mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath37 then the derived total mass is given by @xmath38 it is clear that @xmath39 represents nh and the minimum eigenvalue of neutrino masses is @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 represents ih and the minimum mass is @xmath12 .",
    "combining the two independent mass squared differences , the total neutrino mass is not less than @xmath41 ev for nh and @xmath42 ev for ih .",
    "note that the mass @xmath10 and @xmath12 should satisfy the conditions : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then the range of @xmath46 is @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 will not be reached . applying this method ,",
    "@xmath46 changes continuously through different neutrino mass hierarchies and the different hierarchies can be treated in a unique parameter .",
    "besides , the lightest neutrino s mass and the neutrinos total mass all can be derived from @xmath46 .    in order to clarify the massive neutrinos effects on the cmb power spectra , the publicly available code * camb * @xcite are used in this paper . in which code the total neutrino mass",
    "is set not less than @xmath41 ev by hand , however , this is not what we disired due to its inability to distinguish nh and ih .",
    "so we modified the code to include the mass hierarchy parameter @xmath46 . on the other hand , we assume that the de could not simply be described by the cosmology constant @xmath3 , whose equation of state is @xmath30 .",
    "we have considered two de mode , one is the @xmath1cdm model and the other is cpl model , and the equation of state are @xmath49 and @xmath34 , respectively . and the two models are also written in the modified * camb * code .",
    "the cosmological parameters in the @xmath1cdm model and cpl model are given by @xmath50 respectively . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are the physical density of baryons and cold dark matter today , @xmath53 is the ratio between the sound horizon and the angular diameter distance at the decoupling epoch , @xmath54 is the thomson scattering optical depth , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the spectral index and amplitude of scalar power spectrum , respectively .",
    "these six cosmological parameters are the base parameters of the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "the additional free parameters @xmath1 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 describes the eos of de models .    to constrain cosmological parameters and the neutrino mass hierarchy parameter , we modified the publicly available cosmological monte carlo ( * cosmomc * ) code @xcite and then run the program with eight independent chains . following are the datasets used in the present work :    * the _",
    "planck _ 2015 data release of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies , including lowteb , tt , ee and te , details about the likelihood code can be found in @xcite ; * the bao data includes the measurements from 6dfgs ( @xmath59 ) @xcite , sdss mgs ( @xmath60 ) @xcite , cmass ( @xmath61 ) and lowz ( @xmath62 ) samples of boss dr12 @xcite , and also the rsd data from the cmass and lowz @xcite ; * the joint light - curve analysis ( jla ) sample@xcite , complied from the snls , sdss , and the samples of several low - redshift of the sne ; * the local measurement of @xmath63 , i.e. hubble space telescop ( hst ) 2016 with @xmath64 at @xmath65 confidence level ( c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "using the datasets mentioned above and a modified version of * cosmomc * , our constraints on the cosmological parameters of the two dynamical de models are listed in table [ tab : results ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] . for comparison with the two de models ,",
    "the best - fit results of the @xmath3cdm model are also listed in table [ tab : results ] . in this table ,",
    "the best - fit results are shown with the @xmath66 c.l .",
    "uncertainty for the cosmological parameters and @xmath9 c.l .",
    "upper limits for the neutrino mass hierarchy parameter @xmath46 , the neutrino s total mass @xmath4 , and minimal mass @xmath67 .    comparing the three models ,",
    "one can obtain that for the six based parameters there is only a marginal difference between the best - fit values of the three models . from table [",
    "tab : results ] , we find that the range of value of the parameter @xmath46 changes significant among the @xmath3cdm , @xmath1cdm , and cpl models .",
    "the @xmath3cdm model has the smallest range of value of @xmath46 , and the cpl model has the largest one . by analyzing the values of different parameters in table [ tab : results ] , it s easier to find that the constraints of cosmological parameters is much looser in the cpl model and much tighter in the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "this also can be easily find out in fig .",

    "contours in the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 planes . from this graphic one can find that as the absolute value of @xmath46 increases , the value of @xmath71 and @xmath67 decreases , and @xmath71 is proportional to @xmath67 . besides , the likelihood distribution for @xmath46 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] indicates that for the @xmath3cdm model @xmath39 ( nh ) is slightly favored compared to @xmath72 ( ih ) , and @xmath73 is strongly disfavored .",
    "but , this trend is not so insignificant for @xmath1cdm model , and for cpl model , it is not sympathetic to either , nh or ih .",
    "according to table [ tab : results ] , the upper limit of @xmath4 at @xmath9 c.l . for @xmath3cdm , @xmath1cdm and cpl models",

    ", respectively . for ih",
    ", this become @xmath83 ev , @xmath84 ev and @xmath82 ev . from eq .",
    "[ eq : smu ] , one can derive the minimal value of @xmath71 for nh and ih as @xmath41 ev and @xmath85 ev .",
    "therefore , we still can not say which hierarchy is the right one .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] , one can also find that @xmath63 is well constrained by the datasets we use in the @xmath3cdm model , but not well in the @xmath1cdm and cpl model .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath63 becomes larger in the dynamical dark energy . as the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] show , for the @xmath3cdm model , @xmath63 is anti - correlated with @xmath71 , but for the @xmath1cdm and cpl model , it seems that @xmath63 has nothing to do with @xmath71 .",
    "the above analysis indicates that the free parameters of the de model have significant influence on the neutrino mass .",
    "thus , in figs .",
    "[ fig : wcdm ] and [ fig : cpl ] we have provied the dependence of @xmath46 upon the parameters of @xmath1cdm and cpl model . for the @xmath1cdm model , from fig .",
    "[ fig : wcdm ] , nh ( @xmath86 ) is positively correlated with @xmath1 but ih ( @xmath72 ) is anti - correlated with @xmath1 . according to the above analysis ,",
    "the total neutrino mass @xmath4 decreases as the absolute value of @xmath46 increases .",
    "then , from fig .",
    "[ fig : wcdm ] we obtain that the smaller @xmath1 is , the higher the upper limit of @xmath4 .",
    "the comparison of the effects between the nh and ih case suggests that nh may favor a slighty bigger value of @xmath1 .",
    "and we can also conclude that for either nh case or ih case , a phantom dark energy is favored , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "unlike @xmath1cdm model , cpl model has two free parameters , both of them have influences on the neutrino mass hierarchy parameter @xmath46 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpl ] , at @xmath9 c.l .",
    ", the constraints in the @xmath88 plane is color - coded by the value of @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath57 is anti - correlated with @xmath58 , the absolute value of @xmath46 is anti - correlated with @xmath57 and positively correlated with @xmath58 .",
    "the effects obtained from nh and ih on cpl model parameter has slight differences , which differs from that of @xmath1cdm .",
    "this figure suggests that a smaller @xmath71 allows de transforms from phantom to quintessence , i.e. , its eos evolving from @xmath87 to @xmath89 , with time going through .     and @xmath9 c.l .",
    "marginalized contours of the neutrinos total mass @xmath71 and the eos @xmath1 in the @xmath1cdm model .",

    "the @xmath3cdm case with @xmath90 and @xmath91 is shown in the plane by the crossed dashed lines . ]",
    "in this paper , using the data combination : _ planck _ 2015 lowteb , tt , te , ee + bao dr12 + jla sn + hst 2016 and considering a unique parameter @xmath46 which is used to determine the three active neutrinos mass , we have studied two representative dynamical de models : the @xmath1cdm model , whose eos is a constant @xmath1 ; and the cpl model , whose eos is time - varying , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "our study has demonstrated that the dynamical de can significantly influence the constraints on the neutrino total mass and the mass hierarchy .    if the unique parameter @xmath93 were determined , one can easily distinguish the nh ( @xmath86 ) from ih ( @xmath72 ) , and derive all of the neutrino masses or the total neutrino mass . in section [ sec : result ] , by comparing our constraining results of @xmath1cdm and cpl model with the @xmath3cdm model , we find that , except for the neutrinos mass , the best - fit values for the based and derived cosmological parameters are almost identical for different models . for the neutrino mass ,",
    "no matter the total mass or the minimum mass , the most tight constraint occurs in the @xmath3cdm model and the loosest constrains occurs in the cpl model . by analyzing the marginalized distribution of @xmath46 , we find that the nh is slightly favored than ih in the @xmath3cdm and @xmath1cdm model , but one can not distinguish nh from ih in the cpl model .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing the dependence of @xmath46 on the free parameters of eos for the two dynamical de models , we find that the effects of neutrinos on the evolution of the universe have a certain degeneracy with de , especially at large total neutrino mass .",
    "the total neutrino mass is anti - correlated with the eos in the @xmath1cdm model , and bigger @xmath71 favors phantom de .",
    "however , for the cpl model , the situation is a little complex due to the introduce of an additional free parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpl ] , one can see that the total neutrino mass is positively correlated with the present value of its eos @xmath57 , and it is anti - correlated with the change rate of eos @xmath58 .",
    "so a bigger @xmath71 suggests bigger present eos and smaller change rate , which indicates that an early phantom but late quintessence de model is more favored .",
