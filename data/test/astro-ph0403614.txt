    "according to our current understanding @xcite , dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) represent the two major components of the present universe .",
    "surprisingly , it is found that the dm and de energy densities , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are today roughly the same ( differing only by a factor of two ) , while their ratio has been varying by several orders of magnitude in the past history of the universe .",
    "it seems quite natural , then , to explore the possibility of a dm  de interaction which could account for this coincidence .",
    "this approach , however , is not free from problems if the de component is interpreted in terms of a dynamical quintessence @xcite scalar field .",
    "indeed , such a scalar is constrained to be extremely light in order to fit the data , giving rise to unwanted long - range forces which may represent a severe threat to the equivalence principle .",
    "in addition , couplings of the quintessence scalar with the gauge field strengths are potential sources of dangerous time variations of the fundamental constants .",
    "a possible way of coping with a very light scalar while avoiding these shortcomings , is to choose to work in the framework of a scalar - tensor gravity ( st ) theory @xcite , where by construction matter has a purely metric coupling with gravity .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in this case , the scalar field can benefit from an attraction mechanism which , during the matter dominated era , makes st overlapping with standard general relativity ( gr ) . at the same time , st may possess a second `` attraction mechanism '' @xcite which will ensure the correct evolution of @xmath1 along a so - called ` tracking ' @xcite solution .    while st can very closely reproduce standard gr at the present time",
    ", it may however lead to major differences in the past evolution of the universe , differences which may result in observable consequences for us today .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite that st theories may have a profund impact on nucleosynthesis . at the same time , a curious fact has recently come to attention : a non  conventional dynamics of the quintessence scalar in the past history of the universe may remain ` hidden ' to the available cosmological observations , but manifest itself through the dm relic abundance @xcite .",
    "it is then worth studying if st may provide a viable quintessence candidate and at the same time have an impact on the dm relic abundance .",
    "we have considered this possibility and computed explicitly the differences from the standard case .",
    "when considering st theories , the departures from standard cosmology are mainly due to the different expansion rate ( @xmath2 ) which they determine . such deviation from the usual expansion rate of gr bears potentially relevant consequences in all those phenomena which are closely dependent on the timing in which they occur .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the possible modifications of the expansion rate of the universe in st at the time of cold dark matter ( cdm ) freeze - out , focussing on weekly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) as the most natural candidates for cdm .",
    "as it is well known , their present relic density depends on the precise moment they decouple and , in turn , on the precise moment the wimp annihilation rate equals the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "we expect then that a variation of @xmath2 in the past may lead to measurable consequences on the wimp relic abundance .    in order to assess the allowed departure of @xmath2 from its standard value at wimps freeze - out",
    ", we have to take into account the bounds imposed on st by phenomena at later epochs @xcite .",
    "we already mentioned the crucial test of nucleosynthesis : passing the bbn exam will imply rather severe restrictions on the coupling of the scalar field of st to matter and also on its initial conditions at temperatures much higher than the wimp freeze - out .",
    "coming to later epochs , we have to consider the photon decoupling and the consequent restrictions imposed by cmb data @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , we will show that the bbn `` filter '' on st is so efficient that it drastically limits any visible effect on the cmb spectrum ( in particular , shifts in the peaks positions are forced to be smaller than the experimental error ) .",
    "more restrictive than the cmb probe turn out to be the gr tests , in particular after the tight bound on the post - newtonian parameter @xmath3 , recently provided by the cassini spacecraft @xcite .",
    "this constraint becomes quite relevant when combined with that on the scalar equation of state of @xmath4 coming from sne ia data @xcite .",
    "we will find that significant deviations from standard cosmology are possible only if the de equation of state differs appreciably from @xmath5 today .",
    "in other words , if de is a cosmological constant , it is unlikely that future cosmological observations will be able to discriminate between st and gr .",
    "the question we intend to explicitly tackle is the following : taking all the abovementioned restrictions ( bbn , cmb , gr tests ) into account , how much can the hubble parameter @xmath2 at the time of wimp freeze - out differ from its canonical value if st replaces gr ?",
    "in other words , how much is the wimp relic density allowed to vary , if we consider st instead of gr ?    we find that in st theories the expansion rate of the universe at few gevs can profoudly differ from the usual value obtained in gr ( with variations up to five orders of magnitude ) and , yet , allow the correct light elements production at bbn .",
    "this situation is perfectly analogous to the ` kination ' effect studied in @xcite , where a modification of @xmath2 at wimp freeze - out was induced by a short period of dominance of the scalar kinetic energy , although with some deal of fine - tuning . in the case considered here , the effect of st on @xmath2 depends on the strength of the scalar - matter coupling , however no particular fine - tuning is needed to pass the severe nucleosynthesis test even when large modifications of @xmath2 at freeze - out occur .",
    "this means that the attraction of st towards gr proceeds very rapidly during the cooling of the universe from the few gevs of wimps freeze - out down to the mev range of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the overlap of st with gr can subsequently be very efficient leading to st scenarios which can hardly be disentangled from ordinary gr in present tests at the post - newtonian level . the fact that st strongly affects the number of cdm particles may turn out to be the major signature of these theories .",
    "> from the point of view of particle physics model building , these large variations in the wimps number density today is of utmost relevance",
    ". particles which were not considered suitable to play a significant role in cdm scenarios can be rescued because of their enhanced number density . on the other hand , particles ( or regions of the parameter space for certain wimps candidates ) , which in usual gr scenarios constitute promising cdm candidates ,",
    "would be excluded because their boosted number would overclose the universe .",
    "these considerations become of particular interest if we focus on the case where the wimps correspond to the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "a complete analysis of the cosmologically excluded and cosmologically interesting regions of the susy parameter spaces in different susy contexts , when st is considered , is presently in progress @xcite .",
    "st theories represent a natural framework in which massless scalars may appear in the gravitational sector of the theory without being phenomenologically dangerous . in these theories",
    "a metric coupling of matter with the scalar field is assumed , thus ensuring the equivalence principle and the constancy of all non - gravitational coupling constants @xcite . moreover , as discussed in @xcite , a large class of these models exhibit an attractor mechanism towards gr , that is , the expansion of the universe during the matter dominated era tends to drive the scalar fields toward a state where the theory becomes indistinguishable from gr .",

    "an analysis of specific particle candidates of dm , in particular in supersymmetric models , will be examined elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the idea of exploiting primordial ( ultralight ) scalars in order to shed some light on a dynamical interpretation of de is by now a widespread research topic in the literature . in this paper",
    "we follow the promising proposal of considering the quintessence scalar as embedded in a scalar ",
    "tensor theory of gravity .",
    "this approach is at variance with the usual interpretation of quintessence as a new light scalar whose interactions with matter are subject to the tight phenomenological constraints on the equivalence principle violation and time - variation of the fundamental coupling constants . identifying the quintessence field with the scalar component of a st theory , instead , does not pose any threat on the equivalence principle , since by construction matter has a purely metric coupling with gravity .",
    "we focus on quintessence st models which possess a double `` attraction mechanism '' , one to gr and the other ensuring @xmath1 to follow a tracking solution .",
    "these two simultaneous mechanisms act as a `` protection '' for the theory to prevent its fall into immediate troubles ( for instance , large departures from gr predictions ) .",
    "nevertheless , we still obtain important phnomenological signatures which might disentangle this theory from gr or other alternative proposals .",
    "the tests of our st scenario divide into two classes : deviations from gr and departures from standard cosmology , in particular concerning the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the latter effect has a big impact on the most distant epoch of the universe for which we have `` direct '' information , i.e. nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , we pointed out that we can further extend the implications of a non - standard @xmath2 in the early universe to times prior to nucleosynthesis . sticking to the standard wimp picture of dm , one of the most relevant events",
    "before bbn is the wimp decoupling which is expected to have occurred at a temperature of a few gevs .",
    "our work shows that , despite the severe `` filters '' on st quintessence models which are provided by bbn , solar system tests of gravity and , to a lesser degree , by cmb , it is still possible to find remarkable enhancements on the expansion rate of the universe at wimp freeze - out , yielding to relic wimp abundances which can vary up to a few orders of magnitude with respect to the standard case .",
    "in this paper we pointed out some general features of the new `` wimp story '' around its decoupling temperature in the presence of st quintessence .",
    "in particular , we noticed that some unexpected effect can take place , such as a short phase of wimp `` re - annihilation '' when st approaches gr .",
    "needless to say , such potentially ( very ) large deviations entail new prospects on the wimp characterization both for the choice of the cdm candidates and for their direct and indirect detection probes .",
