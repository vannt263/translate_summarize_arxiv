    "recent observation of a 2@xmath1 neutron star puts stringent conditions on the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter in neutron star interior @xcite .",
    "it has been long conjectured that neutron star interior might contain exotic phases of dense matter such as hyperons , bose - einstein condensates of antikaons and quarks . in certain cases , exotic components of matter",
    "make the eos softer resulting in maximum masses of neutron stars below 2@xmath1 .",
    "for example , the equations of state involving hyperons lead to maximum neutron star mass below 2@xmath1 when the hyperon - scalar meson coupling is determined from existing hypernuclei data and hyperon - vector meson couplings are estimated from su(6 ) quark model @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that the neutron star mass of 2@xmath1 could be achieved by making hyperon - vector meson coupling stronger @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that the eos including antikaon condensates might result in 2@xmath1 neutron stars if the magnitude of the attractive antikaon optical potential depth is 140 mev or less @xcite .",
    "the idea of antikaon condensation in dense baryonic matter formed in heavy ion collisions as well as in neutron stars , started with the seminal work of kaplan and nelson @xcite .",
    "they investigated the problem within the @xmath2 chiral perturbation theory .",
    "later detailed studies on antikaon condensation in neutron star interior were carried out in the chiral perturbation theory @xcite as well as meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "the first order phase transition from nuclear matter to antikaon condensed matter was either studied using maxwell construction or gibbs phase equilibrium rules .",
    "it was observed that the threshold density for @xmath0 condensation was sensitive to the nuclear eos as well as the strength of the attractive antikaon optical potential depth .",
    "here we are interested in the melting of antikaon condensate in newly born hot and neutrino - trapped protoneutron stars .",
    "the study of antikaon condensation continued at finite temperatures in connection with the metastability of protoneutron stars @xcite as well as the dynamical evolution of the condensation @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature of antikaon condensation in hot neutron stars , just after emission of trapped neutrinos , was investigated for the first time @xcite .",
    "we have recently investigated the thermal nucleation of droplets of antikaon condensed matter in neutron stars after neutrinos were emitted as well as in protoneutron stars @xcite .",
    "further we made use of the results of our earlier calculation on the critical temperature of antikaon condensation in the thermal nucleation of antikaon droplets in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however , there are no calculations on the critical temperature of antikaon condensation in hot and neutrino - trapped protoneutron stars .",
    "this might have important implications to understand whether the droplet of antikaon condensed phase would melt or not during the thermal nucleation in protoneutron stars .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the critical temperature of @xmath0 condensation in protoneutron stars .",
    "the organisation of the paper is the following .",
    "we discuss the model to compute the composition and eos involving @xmath0 condensate at finite temperature in section ii .",
    "results are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv gives a summary .",
    "we investigate the melting of a @xmath0 condensate in hot and neutrino trapped protoneutron stars .",
    "we adopt the finite temperature calculations of ref.@xcite to study this problem .",
    "the antikaon condensation is treated as a second order phase transition from hadronic to @xmath0 condensed matter in protoneutron stars .",
    "both phases of matter are made of neutrons ( @xmath3 ) , protons ( @xmath4 ) , electrons , neutrinos , thermal @xmath0 mesons ; @xmath0 condensate only in the latter phase .",
    "both phases maintain local charge neutrality and beta - equilibrium conditions .",
    "we can write down the total thermodynamical potential of both phases as @xmath5    we describe the hadronic phase using a relativistic field theoretical model where baryons are interacting by the exchange of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian density is given by @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the dirac bispinor for baryons @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the vacuum mass and the isospin operator is @xmath13 .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is @xmath14    the thermodynamic potential per unit volume of the hadronic phase is given by @xcite , @xmath15 ~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the temperature is related to @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the effective baryon mass @xmath18 . neutron and proton chemical potentials are obtained from @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we can immediately calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the hadronic phase such as the pressure @xmath21 and the energy density @xmath22 similarly we can compute neutron and proton number densities which include contributions from both particle and antiparticles @xcite .",
    "next we describe the antikaon condensed phase .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of this phase is calculated adopting the finite temperature treatment of antikaon condensation by pons et al . @xcite . in this case",
    ", we treat the ( anti)kaon - baryon interaction in the same footing as the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme is @xcite , @xmath23 where the covariant derivative is @xmath24 and the effective mass of ( anti)kaons is @xmath25 .",
    "the thermodynamic potential per unit volume in the antikaon condensed phase is @xcite @xmath26~,\\ ] ] where the in - medium energies of @xmath27 mesons are given by @xmath28 and the chemical potential of @xmath0 mesons is @xmath29 .",
    "the threshold condition for @xmath30-wave @xmath0 condensation is given by @xmath31  .",
    "the number density of ( anti)kaons is given by @xmath32 which has contributions from the condensate @xmath33 and thermal ( anti)kaons given by , @xmath34    in the antikaon condensed phase , only thermal ( anti)kaons contribute to the pressure @xmath35 ; the condensate does not contribute to the pressure .",
    "the energy density of ( anti)kaons is given by @xmath36    finally , we can calculate thermodynamic quantities of electrons , neutrinos and their antiparticles from the thermodynamic potential per unit volume @xmath37~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38=2 for electrons and 1 for neutrinos .",
    "we use mean field approximations in this calculation . mean meson fields",
    "are obtained by minimising the total thermodynamic potential of eq .",
    "the total energy density in the condensed phase is @xmath39 .",
    "similarly the total entropy per baryon is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are entropy densities of the hadronic phase , antikaon condensed phase and leptons , respectively @xcite .",
    "further the eos of hot and lepton - trapped matter is constrained by the charge neutrality and @xmath44 equilibrium conditions which are given by , @xmath45",
    "we use the gm1 parameter set for nucleon - meson coupling constants which reproduce the nuclear matter saturation properties i.e. binding energy -16 mev , saturation density ( @xmath46 ) 0.153 @xmath47 , asymmetry energy coefficient 32.5 mev , effective nucleon mass ( @xmath48 ) 0.70 and incompressibility @xmath49 mev @xcite .",
    "kaon - vector meson couplings are obtained from the quark model and isospin counting rules @xcite .",
    "further the kaon - scalar meson coupling is estimated from the real part of antikaon optical potential depth at normal nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "it was already noted that the value of antikaon optical potential depth varied widely from @xmath50 mev as obtained from the analysis of kaonic atom data @xcite to @xmath51 mev in the chiral model @xcite .",
    "earlier we observed that the eos involving the @xmath0 condensate became very soft when the antikaon potential was highly attractive .",
    "such an eos resulted in maximum neutron star mass below 2@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of 2@xmath1 neutron star , the eos including exotic matter is severely constrained .",
    "therefore we perform this calculation for @xmath52 mev which results in a maximum neutron star mass of 2.08@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "kaon - scalar coupling constants are taken from table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a set of values for entropy per baryon @xmath53 in this calculation .",
    "further we take lepton fraction @xmath54 in the protoneutron star .",
    "these correspond to several snapshots in the evolution of neutrino - trapped and hot protoneutron stars . for a fixed entropy per baryon ,",
    "the temperature varies from the center to the surface in the protoneutron star .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 1 .",
    "we highlight this for entropy per baryon @xmath55 .",
    "the temperature increases with baryon density in this case . here",
    ", we also show the corresponding scenario in a hot and neutrino - free neutron star for @xmath55 .",
    "higher temperature is obtained in the neutron star .",
    "further we note that as soon as the antikaon condensate appears in the protoneutron star , there is a drop in the temperature compared with the case without the condensate .",
    "populations of different particle species in the @xmath44-equilibrated protoneutron star matter are shown with baryon density for @xmath55 case in figure 2 .",
    "we observe that the matter is populated with thermal kaons well before the onset of the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "this also leads to the enhancement of the proton fraction .",
    "the threshold density of @xmath0 condensation in the hot and neutrino - trapped protoneutron star matter for entropy per baryon @xmath55 is 4.2@xmath46 . on other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 condensation in the neutrino - trapped matter at zero temperature sets in at 3.68@xmath46 .",
    "similarly , threshold densities of antikaon condensation in neutrino - free neutron stars with @xmath56 mev are 3.16@xmath46 for @xmath55 and 3.05@xmath46 for @xmath57 .",
    "the role of finite temperature is to shift the threshold of antikaon condensation to higher density .",
    "after the appearance of the condensate , @xmath0 density ( @xmath33 ) increases rapidly resulting in higher proton number density in the protoneutron star as evident from fig .",
    "we discuss the thermal effects on the eos and protoneutron star masses .",
    "pressure versus energy density is plotted for entropy per baryon @xmath55 and @xmath57 in figure 3 .",
    "we do not find any appreciable change in the eos due to thermal effects .",
    "this result has important significance for the calculation of thermal nucleation of the antikaon condensed phase in protoneutron stars and justifies the use of a zero temperature eos in that case @xcite .",
    "maximum protoneutron star masses for @xmath55 and @xmath57 cases are 2.228 and 2.214@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding central density for @xmath55 case is 5.3@xmath46 and it is 5.59@xmath46 for @xmath57 .",
    "next we investigate the melting of the condensate in protoneutron star matter as the interior temperature increases . as we follow the evolution of a protoneutron star through several snapshots , we consider different values of entropy per baryon .",
    "we demonstrate the variation of entropy per baryon with temperature for several fixed values of baryon densities and @xmath52 mev in figure 4 .",
    "the condensate density ( @xmath33 ) is a function of both baryon density and temperature .",
    "the condensate disappears above a certain temperature known as critical temperature ( @xmath58 ) . to obtain this critical temperature",
    ", we show the ratio of the condensate density ( @xmath59 ) at finite temperature to that ( @xmath60 ) of zero temperature as a function of temperature for several fixed baryon densities and @xmath52 mev in figure 5 . in each case corresponding to a fixed baryon density , the condensate density diminishes with increasing temperature resulting ultimately in the meltdown of the condensate at the critical temperature of the condensation .",
    "we find that the critical temperature increases as baryon density increases .    in an earlier calculation , we estimated the critical temperature of @xmath0 condensation for hot and neutrino - free neutrons stars @xcite . when we compare the critical temperatures in both cases for a certain baryon density for example 4.4@xmath46 , the critical temperature in the protoneutron star has a smaller value than that of the neutron star as evident from figure 6 .",
    "this may be attributed to more heat content in the protoneutron star than that of the neutron star .",
    "for example , at temperature @xmath61 mev , entropy per baryon corresponding to @xmath62 and @xmath63 are 1.6 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "this finding might be very useful in understanding the thermal nucleation of droplets of antikaon condensed matter in protoneutron stars @xcite .",
    "as we know the critical temperature as a function of baryon density , we can construct a phase diagram of protoneutron star matter involving a @xmath0 condensate .",
    "the phase diagram as temperature versus baryon density is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the solid line representing critical temperatures separates the condensed phase ( shaded region ) from the hadronic phase .",
    "we have investigated the critical temperature of @xmath0 condensation in @xmath44 equilibrated hot and neutrino - trapped protoneutron stars for antikaon optical potential depth @xmath52 mev within the framework of field theoretical models at finite temperature .",
    "the critical temperature of antikaon condensation in hot and neutrino - trapped protoneutron stars increases with baryon density .",
    "it is also noted that the critical temperature of antikaon condensation in a protoneutron star is smaller than that of a hot and neutrino - free neutron star .",
    "this result might play an important role in the thermal nucleation of droplets of antikaon condensed matter in protoneutron stars .",
