    "the present article is a continuation of our works @xcite .",
    "by using the lax operator formalism , in @xcite we constructed a family of pairwise commuting operators such that the jack symmetric functions of the infinitely many variables @xmath2 are their eigenfunctions .",
    "we expressed these commuting operators in terms of the power sum symmetric functions @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the jack symmetric functions can be regarded as limiting cases of macdonald symmetric functions .",
    "the latter depend on the same variables @xmath2 and also on two parameters @xmath5 .",
    "in @xcite we extended the results of @xcite to the latter setting .",
    "in particular , by again using the lax operator formalism we constructed a family of pairwise commuting operators such  that the macdonald symmetric functions are their eigenfunctions . in @xcite",
    "we expressed these commuting operators in terms of the hall - littlewood symmetric functions of the variables @xmath6 and of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "these expressions involve only the hall - littlewood symmetric functions corresponding to the partitions with one part , see subsection [ sec:111 ] here .    shortly after @xcite was published , a.n.sergeev and a.p.veselov communicated to us their remarkable works @xcite where in particular they found essentially the same commuting operators as we did in @xcite .",
    "their approach was different however .",
    "they first computed the limits at @xmath8 of the heckman operators  @xcite acting on all polynomials in the variables @xmath9 .",
    "these @xmath0 operators do not commute in general .",
    "but the restrictions of the power sums of these @xmath0 operators to the space of symmetric polynomials do commute .",
    "moreover , jack symmetric polynomials are eigenfunctions of these restrictions .",
    "jack symmetric functions are then eigenfunctions of the limits of these restrictions at @xmath1 .    -5 mm here we extend this approach from jack to macdonald symmetric functions .",
    "it has been discovered by i.v.cherednik @xcite that the macdonald polynomials in the variables @xmath10 are eigenfunctions of power sums of some @xmath0 commuting operators , acting on all polynomials in these variables .",
    "these operators are called the cherednik operators , see our subsection [ sec:13 ] for their definition .",
    "it has been also known @xcite that the cherednik operators have limits at @xmath1 .",
    "however , explicit expressions for these limits are unknown .",
    "we offer a solution to this open problem by firstly introducing for the macdonald polynomials the analogues of non - commuting heckman operators , see our subsection [ sec:15 ] .",
    "these analogues act on the rational functions of @xmath10 and are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "they are related to the cherednik operators by proposition [ sec:15 ] .",
    "the principal property  of the operators @xmath12 is stated as theorem  [ sec:16 ] , see also proposition [ sec:13 ] .",
    "an explanation is needed here regarding our scheme of referring to lemmas , propositions , theorems and corollaries .",
    "when referring to these , we indicate the subsections where they respectively appear .",
    "there is no more than one of each of these in every subsection , so our scheme should cause no confusion .",
    "for example , proposition [ sec:13 ] is the only proposition that appears in subsection  [ sec:13 ] .    in subsection [ sec:17 ]",
    "we reformulate theorem [ sec:16 ] by introducing a certain @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 with operator entries acting on the rational functions of the variables @xmath9 .",
    "it is closely related to the classical lax matrix of the trigonometric ruijsenaars - schneider model @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath15 be the operator defined by . in the classical limit @xmath16 ,",
    "when the canonical commutation relation @xmath17 degenerates to the poisson bracket @xmath18 , our @xmath14 degenerates to this lax matrix up to a change of variables and up to conjugation by a diagonal matrix . in the same classical limit",
    ", the macdonald determinant degenerates to the characteristic determinant of the lax matrix .",
    "thus we have found a way to derive a quantum analogue of this lax matrix directly from the cherednik operators .",
    "it is well known how the quantum hamiltonians @xcite of the trigonometric ruijsenaars - schneider model are related to the macdonald operators , see for instance @xcite .",
    "but our generating series for quantum hamiltonians differs from the determinant and is new .",
    "a similar resolvent - type expression was used for the quantum calogero - sutherland model in @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates of the latter model are the jack symmetric polynomials .",
    "the limit at @xmath8  of the generalisation of that model to particles with spin has been studied in @xcite as another extension of our work @xcite .    following the approach of @xcite in subsection [ sec:31 ] of our article we compute the limits at @xmath8 of the operators @xmath11 .",
    "then we also compute the limit of the restriction of the operator sum appearing in theorem  [ sec:16 ] to the space of symmetric polynomials in @xmath9 .",
    "this limit is a formal power series in another variable @xmath19 with operator coefficients acting on the symmetric functions of @xmath6 .",
    "after renormalisation and a change of the variable @xmath20 , this limit becomes the same generating series of the pairwise commuting operators as we constructed in @xcite . for details , see subsections [ sec:32 ] and [ sec:33 ] here .    in this article",
    "we generally keep to the notation of the book @xcite for symmetric functions . when using results from @xcite we simply indicate their numbers within the book . for example , the statement ( 6.9 ) from chapter i of the book will be referred to as [ i.6.9 ] assuming it is from  @xcite .",
