    "a nucleus is at the heart of every atom , and loosely speaking , is a collection of protons and neutrons that interact pairwise , with much smaller , but significant , three - body interactions .",
    "we are fortunate to know that the underlying laws governing the strong interactions result from a quantum field theory called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is constructed in terms of quark and gluon fields with interactions determined by a local su(3 ) gauge - symmetry and , along with quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , underpins all of nuclear physics when the five relevant input parameters , the scale of strong interactions @xmath1 , the three light - quark masses @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the electromagnetic coupling @xmath5 , are set to their values in nature .",
    "it is remarkable that the complexity of nuclei emerges from `` simple '' gauge theories with just five input parameters .",
    "perhaps even more remarkable is that nuclei resemble collections of nucleons and not collections of quarks and gluons . by solving qcd , we are expecting to predict , with arbitrary precision , nuclear processes and the properties of multi - baryon systems .",
    "the fine - tunings observed in the structure of nuclei , and in the interactions between nucleons , are peculiar and fascinating aspects of nuclear physics .",
    "for the values of the input parameters that we have in our universe , the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions are fine - tuned to produce unnaturally large scattering lengths in both s - wave channels ( described by non - trivial fixed - points in the low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) ) , and the energy levels in the @xmath6be - system , @xmath7c and @xmath8 are in `` just - so '' locations to produce enough @xmath7c to support life , and the subsequent emergence and evolution of the human species . at a fundamental level",
    "it is important for us to determine the sensitivity of the abundance of @xmath7c to the light - quark masses and to ascertain the degree of their fine - tuning .",
    "being able to solve qcd for the lightest nuclei , using the numerical technique of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) , would allow for a partial unification of nuclear physics .",
    "it would be possible to `` match '' the traditional nuclear physics techniques - the solution of the quantum many - body problem for neutrons and protons using techniques such as no - core shell model ( ncsm ) , greens function monte carlo ( gfmc ) , and others , to make predictions for the structure and interactions of nuclei for larger systems than can be directly calculated with lqcd . by placing these calculations on a fundamental footing , reliable predictions with quantifiable uncertainties",
    "can then be made for larger systems .",
    "during the 1990 s , the nuclear forces were systematized by the hierarchy emerging from the spontaneously broken chiral symmetries of qcd .",
    "the resulting small expansion parameters are powers of the external momenta and powers of the light - quark masses normalized to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , as pioneered by weinberg , first in the meson sector and then the multi - nucleon sector  @xcite . in addition to generating nuclear forces that are consistent with qcd",
    ", this construction provides the calculational advantage of parametric estimates of the systematic uncertainty introduced by the truncation of the nuclear interactions at a given order in the expansion .",
    "the actual ordering of contributions remains a subject of debate even today , with weinberg s chiral expansion of the potential having its peculiar difficulties , as does the ksw expansion of scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "calculations are being performed at a sufficiently high order where the size of truncation errors are quite small .",
    "weinberg s ordering of operators based upon a chiral expansion of the n - body potentials between nucleons has been carried out to n@xmath9lo , which includes contributions to the three - body ( starting at n@xmath10lo ) and the leading four - body interactions ( starting at n@xmath9lo ) ( for a recent review see ref .",

    "eventually , there are too few experimental constraints to practically reduce the systematic uncertainty below some level in any given calculation . however , lqcd calculations are expected to provide a way to constrain the nuclear forces beyond what is possible with experiment , and hence to further reduce the systematic uncertainties in nuclear structure calculations . beyond providing direct calculations of important quantities , lqcd calculations of the light nuclei and nuclear forces can    1 .   verify experimental constraints and/or reduce the uncertainties in the constraints imposed by experiment , 2 .",

    "lqcd is a technique in which space - time is discretized into a four - dimensional grid and the qcd path integral over the quark and gluon fields at each point in the grid is performed in euclidean space - time using monte carlo methods .",
    "a lqcd calculation of a given quantity will deviate from its value in nature because of the finite volume of the space - time ( with @xmath11 lattice points ) over which the fields exist , and the finite separation between space - time points ( the lattice spacing , @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , such deviations can be systematically removed by performing calculations in multiple volumes with multiple lattice spacings , and extrapolating using the theoretically known functional dependences on each .",
    "supercomputers are needed for such calculations due to the number of space - time points and the monte carlo evaluation of the path integral over the dynamical fields . in order for a controlled continuum extrapolation ,",
    "the lattice spacing must be small enough to resolve structures induced by the strong dynamics , encapsulated by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "further , in order to have the hadron masses , and also the scattering observables , exponentially close to their infinite - volume values , the lattice volume must be large enough to contain the lightest strongly interacting particle , encapsulated by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the pion and @xmath17 is the extent of the spatial dimension of the cubic lattice volume ( this , of course , can be generalized to non - cubic volumes ) .",

    "the low - energy constants in the appropriate eft are fit to the results of the lqcd calculations , which are then used to take the limit @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "computational resources devoted to lqcd calculations are becoming sufficient to be able to perform calculations at the physical values of the light quark masses in large enough volumes and at small enough lattice spacings to be relevant , but the majority of present day calculations are performed with pion masses of @xmath22 . therefore , most calculations require the further extrapolation of @xmath23 , but do not yet include strong isospin breaking or electromagnetism . in principle , the gauge - field configurations that are generated in lqcd calculations can be used to calculate an enormous array of observables , spanning the range from particle to nuclear physics . in practice , this is becoming less common , largely due to the different scales relevant to particle physics and to nuclear physics .",
    "calculations of quantities involving the pion with a mass of @xmath24 are substantially different from those of , say , the triton with a mass of @xmath25 , and with the typical scale of nuclear excitations being @xmath26 .",
    "present day dynamical lqcd calculations of nuclear physics quantities are performed with @xmath27 , lattice spacings of @xmath28 and volumes with spatial extent of @xmath29 .",
    "lqcd calculations are approached in the same way that experimental efforts use detectors to measure one or more quantities - the computer is equivalent to the accelerator and the algorithms , software stack , and parameters of the lqcd calculation(s ) are the equivalent of the detector .",
    "the parameters , such as lattice spacing , quark masses and volume , are selected based upon available computational resources , and simulations of the precision of the calculation(s ) required to impact the physical quantity of interest , i.e. simulations of the lqcd monte carlos are performed .",
    "the size of the computational resources required for cutting edge calculations are such that you only get `` one shot at it '' . a typical work - flow of a lqcd calculation consists of three major components .",
    "the first component is the production of an ensemble of gauge - field configurations which contain statistically independent samplings of the gluon fields resulting from the lqcd action .",
    "the production of gauge - fields requires the largest partitions on the leadership class computational facilities , typically requiring @xmath30k compute cores .",
    "present - day calculations have @xmath31 dynamical light - quark flavors and use the wilson , @xmath32-improved - wilson , staggered ( kogut - susskind ) , domain - wall or overlap discretizations , each of which have their own `` features '' .",
    "it is the evaluation of the light - quark determinant ( the determinant of a sparse matrix with dimensions @xmath33 ) that consumes the largest fraction of the resources .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath34 hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) trajectories are required to produce an ensemble of @xmath35 decorrelated gauge fields , but in many instances this is an under estimate . for observables involving quarks ,",
    "a second component of production is the determination of the light - quark propagators on each of the configurations .",
    "the light - quark propagator from a given source point ( an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prop ] ) is determined by an iterative inversion of the quark two - point function , using the conjugate - gradient ( cg ) algorithm or variants thereof such as bicgstab , or the most recently developed multi - grid ( mg ) .",
    "[ fig : prop],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    during the last couple of years , the propagator production codes have been ported to run on gpu machines in parallel .",
    "gpu s can perform propagator calculations faster than standard cpu s by an order of magnitude , and have led to a major reduction in the statistical uncertainties in many calculations .",
    "there have been numerous algorithm developments that have also reduced the resources required for propagator production , such as the implementation of deflation techniques and the use of multi - grid methods .",
    "the third component of a lqcd calculation is the production of correlation functions from the light - quark propagators .",
    "this involves performing all of the wick contractions that contribute to a given quantity .",
    "the number of contractions required for computing a single hadron correlation function is small .",
    "however , to acquire long plateaus in the effective mass plots ( emps ) that persist to short times , lscher - wolff type methods involve the computation of a large number of correlation functions resulting from different interpolating operators , and the number of contractions can become large .",
    "in contrast , the naive number of contractions required for a nucleus quickly becomes astronomically large ( @xmath36 for uranium ) , but symmetries in the contractions , and new algorithms ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) greatly reduce the number of operations that must be performed . a further consequence of the hierarchy of mass scales is that there is an asymptotic signal - to - noise problem in nuclear correlation functions .",
    "the ratio of the mean value of the correlation function to the variance of the sample from which the mean is evaluated degrades exponentially at large times .",
    "however , this is absent at short and intermediate times and the exponential degradation of the signal - to - noise in the correlation functions can be avoided .",
    "capability computing resources provided by leadership class computing facilities are used to produce ensembles of gauge - field configurations , while capacity computing resources , both those operated by usqcd and elsewhere are used to perform observable - dependent calculations of correlation functions using these configurations .",
    "thus the capability resources enable a multitude of physics calculations to be accomplished with the capacity resources . in the area of cold nuclear physics",
    "there is currently a well - defined set of goals , and a program in place to accomplish these goals , as described in one of the 2013 usqcd whitepapers  @xcite : * hadron structure * , * hadron spectroscopy * , * hadronic interactions , nuclear forces and nuclei * , and * fundamental symmetries*.      before calculations of nuclei can be sensibly undertaken , the mass and structure of the nucleon must be reproduced in lqcd calculations .",

    "unfortunately , the window shrinks as the number of nucleons is increased , and so further developments will be required to go to much larger nuclei .",
    "a second roadblock that inhibited progress in lqcd calculations of nuclei was the number of wick contractions required to form a correlation function .",

    "these have led to very efficient calculations of the s - shell nuclei and hypernuclei , moving beyond the s - shell requires extensions of these works , and new ideas are required to calculate heavier nuclei .",
    "one of the points of discussion that came up during this presentation was how to optimally couple the results of lqcd calculations to nuclear structure calculations .",
    "given the expertise in the nuclear structure community , it makes little sense for lqcd theorists to `` go it alone '' and attempt to calculate the entire periodic table .",
    "it makes much more sense for the lqcd theorists to produce sets of quantities that can be handed to the nuclear structure theorists who use them in their machinery to determine the periodic table .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the lqcd effort in the us relies heavily on scidac funding to support the scientists who develop and optimize the software to run on the rapidly evolving computational hardware , e.g. gpu - accelerated compute nodes that comprise titan at ornl , or the bg / qs at anl and llnl .",
    "further , the effort requires ongoing access to both capability computing resources on leadership - class computing facilities , and capacity computing obtained from nersc , xsede , through usqcd and at local compute clusters . ongoing software ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mgsoftware ] ) and hardware support are critical to progress in this area .",
    "ideally , one would start with a lqcd calculation and predict all of the quantities of interest in low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "presently , we are not in a position to do this , even if significantly more computing resources were provided to the program .",
    "while lscher provided the formalism to relate the two - body s - matrix directly to two - particle energy levels inside a cubic volume with the fields subject to periodic boundary conditions  @xcite , which has since been understood and generalized to the two - nucleon systems , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , such formalism is complicated to apply in coupled - channels systems  @xcite .",
    "further , the formalism is not in place for the three- and higher - body sectors , but progress is being made in such systems  @xcite .",
    "_ * happy birthday james * : james vary is one of the first nuclear theorists i met when i arrived in the united states to enter the phd program at caltech in the mid 1980 s .",

    "when i learned that this conference was in part to celebrate james s 70th birthday , i was taken aback as it seems like yesterday that he was in his early 40 s ( and i was in my early 20 s ) , and he has retained the same passion and energy for science .",
    "i should also add that james is responsible for me remembering the value of @xmath77 ! happy 70@xmath78 ! ! _",
