    "the study of quantum thermal machines has attracted an increasing attention over the last years .",
    "this is motivated on one hand by the fundamental interest in understanding the emergence of basic thermodynamical principles at the quantum mechanical level @xcite , and on the other hand , by the potential technological applications of these machines , for instance to control the heat transport in nanoengineered devices @xcite .",
    "in particular , several models have been proposed @xcite realizing _ quantum absorption chillers _ , that is , refrigerators in which the external source of work is replaced by a heat bath .",
    "a realization of such refrigerators , which has been introduced in @xcite , consists of three interacting qubits , with a vanishingly small interaction strength , each one in contact with a heat bath . in spite of the technological challenges behind its physical implementation",
    ", this machine can be experimentally realized , e.g. , with superconducting qubits or arrays of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its operation may be understood in a very neat way , providing a physical insight into the sources of irreversibility in absorption chillers @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that , with a suitable choice of the machine parameters , such a refrigerator can ideally attain a coefficient of performance ( cop ) reaching the carnot bound @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that the central assumption of vanishing mutual interaction between the refrigerator qubits can not be realistically maintained . as long as the interaction is finite ,",
    "each bath will exchange energy with the whole three - qubit system , rather than just locally with the single qubit to which it is connected .",
    "this is usually the case with any interacting multiparticle dissipative system .",
    "as we shall show , the resulting delocalized dissipation prevents the refrigerator from approaching the carnot limit arbitrarily closely , thus embodying a fundamental source of irreversibility that is expected to arise in all concrete implementations .",
    "this situation is reminiscent to that of realistic heat engines or cooling cycles , topical areas of study in _ finite - time thermodynamics_. there , the finite heat transfer rates constitute the essential source of irreversibility which makes the carnot bound unattainable in practice .",
    "for this reason , an important line of research deals with devising alternative , tight performance bounds , such that some suitable figure of merit of the machine under consideration is maximized @xcite . in this spirit , we address the following question : what is the highest achievable _ cop at maximum cooling power _ for the quantum absorption refrigerators of refs .",
    "@xcite ? answering",
    "this question would provide a practical performance bound against which the efficiency of any future realization of these machines could be benchmarked .",
    "another relevant and related question to ask is whether the `` quantumness '' of the refrigerator , as revealed for instance by the stationary quantum discord @xcite , plays any role in its operation .",
    "this would help to unveil connections between quantum correlations and efficient energy transport out of equilibrium , that so far have remained elusive .",
    "in this paper we answer both questions . in the first place , by considering unstructured bosonic baths and a consistent dissipative qubit - bath interaction",
    ", we find that the cop at maximum power is tightly upper bounded by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the carnot cop and @xmath4 are the three temperatures between which the refrigerator operates .",
    "we also give sufficient conditions to saturate this bound in the limit of large temperature difference @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , we issue a comprehensive analysis of stationary bipartite quantum correlations in the various relevant qubit - qubit partitions .",
    "although a nonvanishing discord is always found in a specific partition , it does not relate with the stationary heat flows , reinforcing the idea that this family of thermal machines operates in an effectively classical way @xcite , despite having a genuinely quantum physical support .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section  [ secprelim ] we introduce the microscopic model of the three - qubit refrigerator object of our study . in section  [ secdeloc ]",
    "we address its reduced dynamics via a lindblad - type master equation ( whose derivation is deferred to appendix  [ secappa ] ) , that allows for a _ consistent _ treatment of dissipation .",
    "we also point how the _ delocalized dissipation _ effects , unavoidable in practice , prevent the refrigerator from being maximally efficient . in section  [ secbound ]",
    "we demonstrate the existence of general upper bounds on the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator at maximum cooling power , and provide design prescriptions to saturate such bounds ( a supporting analytical proof is presented in appendix  [ secappb ] ) . in section  [ secqc ]",
    "we report our complete study of stationary bipartite quantum correlations in the system .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section  [ secconcl ] .",
    "let us begin by introducing the total hamiltonian of the refrigerator .",
    "the hilbert space of the system is @xmath6 , where we label the three qubits as ` work ' , ` hot ' , and ` cold ' ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , after the heat baths to which each of them is connected ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "their free hamiltonians are @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and we work in natural units @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding bosonic baths are given by @xmath13 as local qubit - bath dissipative coupling , we choose terms of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 to ensure flat spectral densities @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "here , we absorbed the order of magnitude of @xmath18 into the dissipation rate @xmath19 . with no loss of generality , we can set @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this kind of system - environment coupling stands e.g. for the dipole interaction between a two - level atom and the electromagnetic field at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it only remains to specify the three body interaction between the qubits , which in our case is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the interaction strength .",
    "the qubit energies are chosen as @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , so that the subspace @xmath26 is approximately degenerate , as long as @xmath27 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then finally @xmath28    , at a rate @xmath19 .",
    "the three - body interaction , of strength @xmath23 , allows for energy exchange between the refrigerator qubits , whose energy spacings @xmath29 are required to satisfy @xmath24.,width=302 ]    we now briefly explain how the operation of the refrigerator may be understood ( see @xcite for details ) . in the ideal scenario of vanishing @xmath23 ,",
    "the reduced stationary state of the work and hot qubits @xmath30 , has high fidelity with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the thermal state of qubit @xmath33 at the equilibrium temperature @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denotes the reduced state of the three qubits after tracing out the heat baths .",
    "it follows that the truncation of @xmath36 into the two - dimensional subspace @xmath37 of @xmath38 spanned by @xmath39 , which defines a ` machine virtual qubit ' @xmath40 , has an effective virtual temperature approximately given by @xmath41    the interaction @xmath42 allows the cold qubit to exchange energy with the machine virtual qubit , while being simultaneously thermalized by the cold bath through @xmath43 .",
    "suitable choice of frequencies and temperatures may result in @xmath44 , so that the ( non - equilibrium ) stationary state @xmath45 is effectively _ colder _ than @xmath46 .",
    "the excited state population deficit in @xmath45 is compensated by a net energy transfer from the cold bath ( that stands for the object to cool ) into the refrigerator .",
    "this is what we shall understand by _",
    "the machine therefore just mediates between the cold object at temperature @xmath46 and a suitably filtered virtual temperature @xmath47 .",
    "thermalization is then responsible for cooling within the _ cooling window _ @xmath48 , or in terms of the cold frequency @xmath49 @xmath50 when @xmath51 and always under the assumption of localized dissipation , which is consistently realized only for vanishing @xmath23 , the refrigerator would in principle saturate the carnot bound @xmath1 on cop @xcite .",
    "we shall now extend the model of refs .",
    "@xcite to consistently account for the dissipative dynamics of the refrigerator in a the realistic scenario of even very small but nonvanishing coupling strength @xmath23 .",
    "we can derive a general equation of motion for the qubits from first principles , by employing the standard born - markov assumption of weak - memoryless system - environment interaction @xcite .",
    "such master equation , whose complete derivation is reported in appendix  [ secappa ] , is written as @xmath52+\\sum_{\\alpha}\\mathcal{d}_{\\alpha}\\left[\\varrho\\right]\\\\=-i\\left[h_\\text{ref},\\varrho\\right]+\\sum_{\\alpha,\\omega } \\gamma_{\\alpha,\\omega } \\left ( a_{\\alpha,\\omega}\\varrho a^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha,\\omega } -\\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$ } \\ { a^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha,\\omega } a_{\\alpha,\\omega } , \\varrho \\}_+\\right ) , \\label{master}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
    "the spectral correlation tensor , denoted by @xmath54 , is proportional to the real part of the power spectra of the bath correlation functions .",
    "note that since the heat baths are independent , the correlation tensor is diagonal in @xmath33 .",
    "we use its explicit form for electromagnetic radiation at thermal equilibrium : @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the non - hermitian lindblad operator @xmath56 , associated with bath @xmath33 , performs transitions of frequency @xmath57 at rate @xmath54 , between the ( @xmath23-independent ) eigenstates of the refrigerator hamiltonian @xmath58 .",
    "they result from the decomposition of the system - environment couplings ( @xmath59 ) as eigen - operators of the refrigerator hamiltonian ( @xmath60=-\\omega a_{\\alpha,\\omega}$ ] ) .",
    "note that the corrections to @xmath61 resulting from the system - environment interaction ( i.e. lamb shift hamiltonian ) have been neglected in eq .  , and that the rotating wave approximation is implicit its derivation .",
    "therefore the time scale of the system @xmath62 must be much smaller than the dissipation time , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "our dissipative system - environment coupling operators @xmath64 give rise to six open decay channels ( for each @xmath33 ) , associated with the frequencies @xmath65 .",
    "consider , for instance , the lindblad operators within the cold _ dissipator _ @xmath66 : while the operators @xmath67 produce transitions @xmath68 in which the cold bath exchanges energy _ locally _ with the cold qubit only , the remaining operators , e.g. @xmath69 , are instead responsible for processes like @xmath70 in which bath @xmath9 now exchanges energy with the work and hot qubit as well , in a _ delocalized _ way .",
    "it is in this sense , that we refer to @xmath71 as modelling a _ delocalized dissipation _ effect .    of course , as the limit of vanishing coupling @xmath23",
    "is approached , the rates @xmath72 and @xmath73 become equal , and all delocalized transitions tend to compensate each other . for @xmath74 , only two ( local ) decay channels remain open for each bath , namely @xmath75 , which stands for the usual ladder operators for qubit @xmath33 ( the remaining qubits are denoted as @xmath76 ) . the idealized model of refs .",
    "@xcite is recovered in this limit .",
    "note that since the frequencies appear exponentiated in the spectral correlation tensor , delocalized dissipation effects are intuitively expected to be still relevant ( i.e. @xmath77 ) even for arbitrarily small @xmath78 ( see appendix  [ secappa ] ) .    equipped with the stationary solutions of the markovian master equation eq .  , we can compute the central quantities of our study , namely the rates at which energy from each bath is fed into the system , i.e. , the heat currents .",
    "these are given as @xmath79\\}$ ] @xcite .",
    "in particular , we refer to @xmath80 as _ cooling power_. therefore , the cop reads : @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "let now us comment on our intuition linking delocalized dissipation with _",
    "irreversibility _ in the operation of the machine .",
    "the carnot cop @xmath1 is realized at the upper limit of the cooling window eq .",
    ", whenever @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this would be the case ( for arbitrary @xmath23 ) if one replaced the consistent eq .   with a `` localized '' master equation such as : @xmath83+\\sum_{\\alpha}\\mathscr{d}_{\\alpha}\\otimes\\mathbbm{1}_{\\overline{\\alpha}}\\left[\\varrho\\right]$ } , \\label{masterlocal}\\ ] ] like the one used in @xcite . here ,",
    "the notation @xmath84 stands for some dissipator acting locally on qubit @xmath33 , in spite of using the full interacting hamiltonian @xmath85 to account for the free dynamics .",
    "recall from the preceeding considerations , that such localized model for the dissipation is only physically consistent in the limit of strictly vanishing @xmath23 @xcite . on the contrary , if the realistic delocalized description of eq .   is adopted , given any value of the qubit - qubit interaction , no matter how small , it becomes impossible to approach @xmath1 arbitrarily closely , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "there we plot the _ performance caracteristics _ for the refrigerator according to eq .",
    "( solid ) , and as results from the localized master equation of the type eq .",
    "( dashed ) used in @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the operation temperatures are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we also fix @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the only remaining free parameter , @xmath49 , is varied from @xmath93 to the upper limit of the cooling window eq .",
    "@xmath94 , and the cooling power @xmath80 for each configuration is plotted versus the corresponding cop , normalized by the carnot bound @xmath1 .",
    "the cooling powers are also normalized by their maximum values @xmath95 : @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath99 . in the ideal case of eq .",
    ", @xmath100 results in @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "however , any irreversibility would yield a cop not monotonically increasing with @xmath49 , and therefore , a closed performance characteristic , as shown .",
    "this suggests that the unavoidable delocalization in the dissipative dynamics makes the refrigerator non ideal and somehow wasteful , thus introducing a fundamental source of irreversibility that prevents it from cooling at the carnot cop in practice .",
    "as we have just seen , in this three - qubit quantum absorption refrigerators , @xmath1 can not be approached _ arbitrarily closely _ in practice .",
    "it is therefore crucial to introduce an alternative tight bound on some performance indicator , such that its saturation would mark the functioning of the refrigerator as effectively optimal .",
    "a sensible figure of merit in this context is , for instance , the cop @xmath103 at maximum cooling power @xmath95 .",
    "one can then seek to devise a general upper bound for such a performance indicator , and to characterize a region within the space of the control parameters @xmath104 that allows for its saturation .",
    "this would provide useful workpoints for the efficient implementation of the machine .    to investigate this issue",
    ", we run extensive numerics on the stationary states of eq .",
    ", globally optimizing @xmath103 over _ all _ free parameters of the refrigerator , always under the consistency constraints implied by the born - markov and rotating wave approximations .",
    "we found that @xmath103 is tightly upper bounded by @xmath105 this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where @xmath106 was plotted for @xmath107 quantum absorption refrigerators whose free parameters were all sampled at random .    in order to get analytical insight into the role and possible origin of the performance limit",
    ", we resort to the much simpler mathematical description based on the localized master equation of refs .",
    "@xcite . even though the irreversibility associated with delocalized dissipation is completely absent in this ideal case , meaning that the cop can reach @xmath1 ( albeit at vanishing power ) , the cop at maximum cooling power is , nonetheless , still tightly upper bounded when optimization over all parameters is carried out .",
    "specifically , a similar numerical analysis shows that the bound turns out to be @xmath108 for the localized model .",
    "one can actually show this analytically , given @xmath109 and @xmath110 such that : ( i ) @xmath111 , and ( ii ) @xmath112 ( see appendix [ secappb ] for a detailed proof ) , such a performance bound is saturated in the limit of _ large temperature difference _ @xmath113 .",
    "interestingly , coming back now to the realistic situation modelled by eq .  , with a consistent treatment of delocalized dissipation , one sees that conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are also sufficient to saturate the @xmath2 performance bound on the cop at maximum power when working at high difference between the operating temperatures .",
    "these conditions , therefore , provide the desired design prescriptions for the practical implementation of efficient quantum absorption refrigerators of this kind . however , it is in order to remark that those are just _ sufficient _ conditions for optimal performance , and do not need to be necessarily met in order to attain a nearly optimal cop at maximum power : for instance , even the machine in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] cools very close to the bound , despite having @xmath114 .",
    "finally , note that the fact that the performance bound differs quantitatively when the oversimplified localized picture is used instead ( @xmath115 vs @xmath116 as a fraction of @xmath1 ) , should not be surprising , as the underlying dissipative dynamics also encloses essential differences . the important point , however , is that the bound is also tight in that case , and that the analytical expression of the idealized stationary state is tractable enough and even proves insightful to obtain prescriptions for the saturation of the @xmath2 bound in the realistic model of eq .",

    "this supports the conclusion that the only essential quantum ingredient exploited by the machine is in fact the discreteness of its energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "we recall that quantum discord is defined as @xmath127 where the mutual information @xmath128 quantifies total correlations in the bipartite state @xmath129 , and @xmath130 is the post - measurement state after a minimally disturbing projective measurement on @xmath131 .",

    "[ fig2s ] ) . similarly to @xmath80 , for _ intermediate _ values of @xmath110 all correlations are peaked around a certain value of @xmath49 that nevertheless usually differs from the frequency @xmath149 that maximizes @xmath80 [ cf .",

    "another important step towards the derivation of the master equation eq .",
    "is the assumption that the typical system time - scales @xmath195 with @xmath196 , are much smaller than the relaxation time @xmath197 , which allows to discard all rapidly oscillating terms @xmath196 that average to zero in a coarse - grained picture of the reduced dynamics ( rotating wave approximation ) .",
    "this leaves ( we refer again to @xcite for details ) @xmath198 where we have discarded the lamb - shift term @xmath199 $ ] as usually done when working in the quantum optical regime .",
    "the only thing that remains to be done in order to recover eq .  , is to transform eq .   back into de schrdinger picture by noting that @xmath200    this immediately yields eq .",
    "if one identifies @xmath56 with @xmath201 .",
    "the reduced dynamics generated by equation eq .   may be understood as a stochastic process in the hilbert state space of the refrigerator qubits , in which the deterministic evolution of any pure state is interrupted by discontinuous quantum jumps @xmath202 , occurring at rates @xmath54 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath203 at any time @xmath204 is recovered as an esemble average over stochastic trajectories @xcite .",
    "it is clear that all interaction picture jump operators @xmath174 introduced above , can produce delocalized dissipation ( quantum jumps ) in the sense discussed in the main article .",
    "as @xmath23 gets closer to zero , the rates @xmath205 and @xmath206 linearly approach each other , meaning that the jump processes @xmath207 and @xmath208 become equally likely , so that their delocalized contributions start to compensate . in the strict limit of @xmath74 ,",
    "only one transition frequency ( @xmath29 ) is left for each bath , the corresponding lindblad operator being just the sum @xmath209 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , which is a localized jump operator",
    ". note that even if the difference @xmath210 depends linearly on @xmath27 , the exponentials in eq .",
    "make it extremely sensitive to the qubit - qubit interaction strength , so that even a slight departure from the non interacting case can make delocalized dissipation effects very important .",
    "let us finally comment on the underlying assumptions leading to eq .  .",
    "even though the rotating wave approximation makes the problem much more tractable , it is not essential and one could just avoid it [ cf .",
    ". situations in which the dissipation times become comparable to the system time scale ( i.e. the realm of quantum brownian motion ) may be then accounted for , conceivably resulting in qualitative differences .",
    "accounting for the non negligible renormalization effects of the system - environment interaction on the system itself , becomes important in these cases . on the contrary , within the quantum optical regime , the rotating wave approximation only slightly modifies the reduced dynamics but not the stationary states of the refrigerator , thus leaving our results unaffected .",
    "if the baths are assumed to have some structure , the markov assumption can not be consistently performed .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the dissipation strength remains sufficiently weak so that the born approximation is still in place , no qualitative differences should be expected from what we report in the main article . finally , if the dissipation becomes strong enough , the thermalization of a single isolated qubit in contact with its corresponding bath is no longer guaranteed , so that the basic operation of the refrigerator is compromised .",
    "considering the localized dissipative model of @xcite , we shall now prove that its cop at maximum power @xmath103 is upper bounded by @xmath108 , whenever conditions            here , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 only depend on the three , possibly different , dissipation rates @xmath217 , while @xmath218 and @xmath219 depend on all temperatures and frequencies .",
    "all we need to do is to find the @xmath149 that maximizes eq .  , and then compute the corresponding @xmath103 .",
    "first of all , note that conditions and imply @xmath220 for any @xmath221 , i.e. within the cooling window @xmath222 due to the ordering @xmath223 in the bath s equilibrium temperatures , we must also have @xmath224 . since @xmath225",
    ", this translates into @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , conditions and can be alternatively stated as @xmath227 furthermore , in the limit of large temperature difference @xmath113 , assuming that @xmath228 is at least of order @xmath229 and @xmath230 , we also have @xmath231 as a consequence , eqs .   and can be expressed as        the solution to an equation of the form @xmath234 may be expressed in terms of the _ lambert - w function _ or _",
