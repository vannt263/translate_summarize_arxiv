    "several arguments based on the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) show that the hadronic matter makes transition from the hadron phase to the quark - gluon one at sufficiently high temperature and/or large baryon - number density .",
    "in particular , recent intensive studies on the quark matter suggest that , in low temperature , it becomes a condensed state of quark pairs called the color superconductor ( csc ) , where the color @xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken  @xcite . in model calculations ,",
    "the most attractive quark - quark interaction induced by gluon exchange appears in the total spin singlet ( @xmath5 ) and the color anti - triplet ( @xmath6 ) channel , so that the csc phase is considered to be a state where the quark pairs with these quantum numbers are condensed coherently in a similar mechanism with the bcs theory  @xcite .    generally , there exist two limiting cases in the fermion - pair condensation : weak- and strong - coupling regions in the strength of the two - fermion correlation . in the weak - coupling region , which appears in the high - density quark matter because of the asymptotic - freedom of qcd  @xcite , the coherence length @xmath7 becomes larger than the interquark distance @xmath8 , and",
    "the quark matter becomes the weakly - interacting fermion system where the mean - field picture are applicable .",
    "the strong - coupling region appears in the moderate- or low - density quark matter ( especially in the neighbor of the deconfinement transition point ) .",
    "large pair - fluctuations develop  @xcite and the coherence length is suggested to be very small ; @xmath9 , even around the moderate - density region [ @xmath10 from the analysis of the improved ladder approximation  @xcite .",
    "this implies that , for low - density region [ @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the strong quark - pair correlations are described by bosonic degrees of freedom , which we call `` diquark '' in this paper .",
    "thus , for the description of this diquark region of the quark matter , the incorporation of two - particle correlations beyond mean - field levels is essentially important .",
    "several methods have been proposed to incorporate the correlation effects .",
    "a typical one is that of nozires and schmitt - rink , where thermodynamic potentials are calculated in the normal phase using the in - medium ladder approximation , and the fermion number density is shown to include a contribution from the bosonic part through the two - body in - medium scatterings  @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature is obtained from the zero - frequency pole of the two - particle correlation function ( thouless criterion for second - order phase transitions ) .",

    "@xcite , especially for the hadronization process in the high - energy @xmath16 collision ; they considered the space - time developments of the quark - gluon plasma as an adiabatic process , and discussed the possibility of the diquark bec rather at high-@xmath17 stages in that process .",

    "with respect to electron gas in superconducting metals @xcite :    particles of compositions ( fermions @xmath107 and composite molecules @xmath22 ) should be quasi - particles ,    correlations between @xmath108 and @xmath109 are unimportant ,    higher - order correlations are not stronger than the pair - correlations considered ,    any localizations to liquid droplets with large volume exclusion ( gas - liquid transition ) do not occur before the formation of quasi - molecules ,    composites sufficiently obey the bose statistics as expected with small size of composites relative to the interparticle distance .",
    "now we discuss the condition 1 ) for quark matter .",
    "the lifetime of a particle relates to various decay processes in medium , and to recognize quark as quasi - particle its lifetime should be at least longer than inverse of the qcd energy scale , that is , @xmath110 fm .",
    "the lifetime of quarks tends to be shorter near the fermi surface , which can be roughly estimated from the imaginary part of quark self - energy , e.g. , @xcite ; @xmath111 mev@xmath112 . in our model",
    "these quarks with short lifetime near fermi surface due to strong pair fluctuations are described as bosonic molecules , and residual quarks in the deeper interior of the fermi sphere have explicitly longer lifetime than the qcd scale .",
    "thus , quarks ( antiquarks ) being outside of pairs due to medium effects can be identified as quasi - particles . as for the diquark composites , its lifetime as quasi - particle",
    "is expected to be longer than that of quarks in crossover regime , as shuryak and zahed suggested the existence of various binary bound states in the whole regions just above the deconfinement temperature because qcd coupling strength is found not to be so small as one has believed so far @xcite .",
    "thus , diquarks should also be identified in medium .",
    "concerning other conditions 2 ) and 3 ) , higher - order correlations rather than pair ones are not treated in this sec .",

    "this means that @xmath15 for lower density region @xmath114 concerned , and our quasi - chemical equilibrium approach with bosonic modes is expected to work well for these strong couplig regimes of quark matter .",
    "the critical coupling strength for the formation of diquark bound states is also calculated by using effective four - fermi interaction model with gaussian approximation  @xcite , and critical value @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is ultraviolet cutoff scale ) and its relavance for real quark matter is suggested therein .",
    "because of smooth crossover , this critical value of coupling strength corresponding to the unitary limit in cold atomic systems brings no sudden changes for physical quantities . the essential quantity for the behavior of bec - bcs",
    "crossover is always the ratio of the coherence length to the interparticle distance .",
    "although above quantitative argumets come from some specific model calculations , recent analyses on qcd experiments , e.g. , relativistic heavy ion collision  @xcite and lattice qcd  @xcite , also suggest that even in deconfinement phase qcd holds strong coupling at almost whole region of the phase diagram relevant to possible observations .",
    "we expect that our present approach works well in such strong coupling regimes in more general way , especially around the region close to the phase transition line where correlations between quarks should develop largely and the strong coupling picture becomes essential for the pairing problem . in this",
    "context three - quark correlations in addition to pairing will be important issue around this region , which can also be treated in our approach .    here",
    "we comment on the bec - bcs crossover in beta - equilibriated charge - neutral quark matter , where mismatches of fermi surfaces exist in different flavors . even in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "various phases have been proposed in that matter in relation with the chromomagnetic instability problem : the gapless superconductor  @xcite , the crystalline color superconductor  @xcite , the gluon condensed state  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the strong coupling limit has also been discussed of the two - flavor quark matter with fermi - surface mismatch  @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that the cooper - pair formation should still be favored in the case if the energy gain by the pairing exceeds the energy differences of the mismatched fermi surfaces .",
    "thus we can expect the crossover into the diquark bec in the quark matter with finite mismatches for sufficiently large coupling strength and , at the temperature around @xmath14 , the mismatch effects are expected to be small with large pairing energy . in low temperature region , however , the fermi - surface mismatches makes the unpaired fermions remain with some flavor , and they should form new fermi surfaces ; the calculation of the profile changes of them around the crossover region should be a very interesting problem in future .",
    "in the present paper , we take the two - flavor quark matter with same fermi surfaces to discuss typical features of diquark bec ; however , our approach can be extended to the case of the finite fermi- surface mismatches and their effects in the diquark bec and crossover will be discussed in another paper .      in what follows , we take u , d - quark matter around the moderate density region in qcd , and consider the chemical equilibrium between quarks and composite diquarks in the 2sc - type pairing state ( color antisymmetric",
    "@xmath6 , flavor antisymmetric , and total - spin @xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "the other types of diquarks can also be created in the quark matter using less attractive channels , e.g. , diquarks in color-@xmath6 , flavor symmetric and the @xmath117 pairing state  @xcite .",
    "but , according to the one - bec theorem derived in the previous section , the diquark bec can occur only for the smallest mass ( most stable ) diquark , i.e. in the 2sc - diquark state of u and d quarks , so that we consider only the 2sc - diquarks .",
    "generally the diquarks which do not participate in the bec would have the effect of lowering the critical temperature , through the total - number conservation , in comparison with the case of one kind of diquark .",
