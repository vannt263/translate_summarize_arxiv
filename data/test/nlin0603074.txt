    "discrete nonlinear models play a very important role in many physical applications @xcite . an important class of these models consists of a few completely integrable lattice equations , such as the toda lattice @xcite , the ablowitz - ladik lattice @xcite , and the integrable sine - gordon lattice @xcite .",
    "the fact that these lattices possess exact soliton solutions demonstrates that , in principle , discreteness of the host media does not preclude the propagation of localized coherent structures .",
    "moreover , the mobility of soliton - like excitations in discrete media is a key issue in many physical contexts ; for instance , the mobility of dislocations , a kind of topological solitons , is of paramount importance in the physics of plastic deformation of metals and other crystalline bodies @xcite .",
    "a prototypical class of discrete models , relevant to a variety of applications , consists of the klein - gordon dynamical lattices @xcite .",
    "one of the main representatives of this family of models is the so - called @xmath0 model @xcite , which features a cubic nonlinearity .",
    "this simple power law nonlinearity renders this model a ripe testbed for studying the existence and stability of nonlinear solutions , and comparing their properties in continua and lattices .    in the @xmath1-dimensional continuum framework ( and in the absence of spatially dependent external potentials ) , a solution can be shifted arbitrarily along @xmath2 by any @xmath3 ( @xmath2 is the spatial coordinate and @xmath4 ) , due to the existing translational invariance . on the other hand , in the discrete system",
    ", translational invariance is generically lost and equilibrium static solutions exist only for a discrete rather than for a continuum set of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "some of these equilibrium solutions correspond to energy maxima and are unstable , while others , corresponding to energy minima , are stable .",
    "the difference between such maxima and minima of the energy is typically referred to as the peierls - nabarro barrier ( pnb ) .",
    "it is of particular interest to develop discretizations that do not feature such barriers . in such cases",
    ", one might expect that the ensuing models would be more faithful representations of their continuum counterparts , regarding both symmetry properties and travelling solution features ( even though there are some notes of caution that should be made ; see e.g. the discussion of @xcite ) .    in that vein , recently , a number of non - integrable discrete klein - gordon equations free of the peierls - nabarro barrier ( pnb - free ) has been systematically constructed .",
    "the first set of such models which were , by construction , hamiltonian ones , was obtained by speight and co - workers @xcite using the bogomolnyi argument @xcite .",
    "a second successful attempt led to the construction of momentum - conserving discretizations @xcite .",
    "it was then demonstrated , surprisingly , that the pnb - free models of that kind conserving both energy and classical momentum do not exist @xcite .",
    "new pnb - free @xmath0 lattices were derived by barashenkov _",
    ". however , we note that for the lattices derived in @xcite , only the kink - type solution has been considered , while it is well - known that the continuum klein - gordon equation can support a number of other solutions @xcite .    on the other hand , a general approach to the construction of the pnb - free lattices",
    "was recently reported in @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the use of the _",
    "discretized first integral _ ( dfi ) of the corresponding static field equation , and the integration constant that enters",
    "dfi generates the one - parameter solution space .",
    "the dfi is in fact a two - point nonlinear algebraic equation from which the exact static solutions of the three - point pnb - free discrete models can be found .    in this work",
    "we systematically use the dfi approach and derive the hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian pnb - free klein - gordon lattices supporting the one - parameter space of solutions , generalizing the lattices offered in @xcite .",
    "we then focus on the @xmath0 field and discuss in detail the energy - conserving pnb - free model proposed very recently in @xcite , as well as the momentum - conserving model of @xcite ( the two are identical in the static case ) .",
    "for these models we describe the full solution space of the underlying static problem that also includes the solutions derived earlier in @xcite .",
    "our setting is the following : we consider the hamiltonian of the klein - gordon field , @xmath5 , with the kinetic and potential energy functionals respectively defined as , @xmath6 @xmath7dx\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the unknown field and @xmath9 is a given potential function .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion is @xmath10 where @xmath11",
    ".    equation ( [ kg ] ) will be discretized on the lattice @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we would like to construct a nearest - neighbor discrete analog to eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) of the form @xmath15 such that in the continuum limit @xmath16 we have @xmath17 _ and _ that the solution to the three - point static problem corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ kleingordondiscrete1 ] ) , @xmath18 can be found from a reduced two - point problem @xmath19 if this reduction is achieved , then the exact static solutions can be constructed upon solving the algebraic eq .",
    "( [ twopointstatic ] ) iteratively , starting from arbitrary admissible value of @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "arbitrariness in the choice of the initial condition implies that the static solution can be placed anywhere with respect to the lattice and , for that reason , such lattices are called translationally invariant .    discretization eq . ( [ kleingordondiscrete1 ] ) may result in a non - hamiltonian model due to the non - potential nature of the background forces . in the latter",
    "setting , the absence of an energy functional renders ambiguous the definition of the pn barrier , hence we clarify this point in what follows .",
    "suppose that we have two equilibrium solutions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( often , in hamiltonian models with pnb , the second one corresponds to a linearly unstable energy maximum while the first one to a linearly stable energy minimum ) .",
    "the work done by the inter - particle and background forces to move the @xmath24th particle from the position @xmath22 to the position @xmath23 is @xmath25 and the total work performed to `` transform '' the solution @xmath22 to @xmath23 is @xmath26 .",
    "the pn barrier is defined to be equal to @xmath27 . for hamiltonian models",
    "this definition is equivalent to the classical one because @xmath27 is equal to the energy difference between the second ( possibly higher energy unstable ) configuration and the first ( possibly lower energy stable ) configuration . for non - hamiltonian models",
    ", @xmath28 will depend on the path connecting the initial and final configurations of particles . to calculate @xmath27 one",
    ", therefore , has to specify such a path .",
    "while the height of the pn barrier in a non - hamiltonian lattice depends on the path , the pnb - free , non - hamiltonian lattice can be unambiguously defined as the translationally invariant lattice where the quasi - static transformation between the two configurations of interest can be done continuously through the set of _ equilibrium _ configurations . along the path through the equilibrium configurations , forces acting on particles are zero and thus , @xmath29 for any @xmath24 which , in turn , results in @xmath30 .",
    "this notion of the pnb - free lattice is also applicable to the hamiltonian lattices and will serve as our definition of the pnb - free models ; notice , however , that we do not overlook the mathematical subtleties involved in this definition , including the question of whether @xmath27 is zero along all realizable paths connecting @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the non - hamiltonian models , among equilibrium configurations , as is the case for their hamiltonian siblings . these and related questions , including an appropriate modified definition of the relevant quantities for models such as those of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger type , will be left for a future publication .",
    "our scope in what follows is to generalize the approach developed in @xcite to show how to construct _ all possible _ exact static solutions of the models of @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , including those derived in @xcite .",
    "this will also lead us to introduce a number of solutions ( both localized and extended ones ) that , to the best of our knowledge , have not been discussed / analyzed previously , such as the ones that will be termed `` inverted '' ( see below ) .",
    "we will also discuss the stability of certain solutions among the obtained ones , for each of the models of interest ( since their stability properties are different ) .",
    "we also note in passing that while our presentation will be geared towards the @xmath0 models , our results regarding the existence of solutions can equally well be applied to discrete equations of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type @xcite , such as e.g. the ablowitz - ladik model .",
    "in particular , let us consider equations of the form : @xmath31 ( where the overbar denotes complex conjugate ) with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . then ,",
    "looking for standing wave solutions of the form @xmath34 , with @xmath21 real , one would obtain the klein - gordon static problem for the standing wave spatial profile @xmath21 .",
    "hence all the discussion given below for the existence of such solutions can be appropriately translated in the existence of standing waves of the corresponding discrete nls models .",
    "the reader should be cautioned however that the stability properties in the latter context may differ [ a relevant example will be discussed later in the text ] .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "pnpfreekg ] , we develop the dfi approach and derive pnb - free klein - gordon models supporting one - parameter space of static solutions . in section [ sec : phi4 ] , we present some pnb - free @xmath0 lattices and describe some of their basic properties . in section [ exactsolutionsdiscrete ] , we discuss the details of the construction of the general exact static solutions of the models both in the localized ( hyperbolic function ) and in the extended ( general elliptic function ) form , and for both signs of the nonlinearity prefactor @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 corresponds to the so - called defocusing case , while @xmath37 corresponds to the focusing case in the standard terminology of nls equations .",
    "examples of the solutions are then given in section [ analysis ] . in section [ linearstability ] , we analyze the stability of the obtained solutions . in section [ dynamics ] , slow kink dynamics in the pnb - free models is compared numerically with that in the classical @xmath0 model . in section [ continuumsolutions ]",
