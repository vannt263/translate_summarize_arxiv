    "the phenomenon of nuclear matter fragmenting into various pieces can be studied in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this has been an area of much activity , both in experiments and in theory .",
    "curtin , toki and scott @xcite pointed out that at some incident energies excited matter that is formed in heavy ion collisions will pass through a liquid - gas phase transition stage and if fragments are formed at this stage , it may show characteristics of this transition .",
    "a study of nuclear matter with a skyrme interaction was made in @xcite where it was shown that in mean field theory there is a phase transition as in van der waals gas . in nuclear physics , phase - transition ,",
    "if it indeed happens , is a transient phenomenon and it is not clear what the mean field theory predicts for observables that can actually be measured . in experiments",
    "the most readily accessible observable is the cross section of nuclear fragments , or yield @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath3 is the mass number or charge of a fragment . of course mean field theories",
    "can not make a prediction about fragment distribution thus it falls short of directly providing results with which one could confront the data .",
    "bauer @xcite and campi @xcite used the percolation model @xcite to calculate fragment distribution @xcite .",
    "there are two varieties of percolation models : the bond and the site percolation . in a bond percolation model",
    "each site of the lattice is occupied by a nucleon .",
    "that is , the number of nucleons equals the number of lattice sites @xmath4 .",
    "the bonds between nearest neighbors are broken with a probability of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the probability that the bond is unbroken .",
    "nucleons which are connected through unbroken bonds form a cluster . in a site percolation model ,",
    "each site is occupied randomly with probability @xmath7 .",
    "the number of nucleons , @xmath8 , is usually less or equal to the number of the lattice sites @xmath4 .",
    "nucleons occupying nearest neighbor sites are considered to be the part of one cluster . in both bond and site percolation models",
    "there is a critical value @xmath9 of @xmath6 at which an infinite cluster starts to emerge . for very large lattice @xmath9",
    "is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the probability that a given site belongs to this infinite cluster is zero for @xmath10 , and grows from 0 to 1 for @xmath11 . in general ,",
    "the cluster distributions in percolation models are very similar to the mass distribution observed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the percolation model is quite different from mean field theories that we first alluded to .",
    "there is just one parameter in a percolation model . in a bond percolation model",
    "the number of sites equals the number of nucleons .",
    "one might regard that the probability @xmath6 is a function of temperature . in that case",
    "there is no parameter corresponding to the volume or the pressure of the system .",
    "if instead one takes the site percolation model , the number of lattice sites @xmath4 is usually larger than @xmath8 .",
    "one may now associate the parameter @xmath6 with the volume .",
    "there is , then , no reference to temperature or pressure .",
    "thus the simple percolation model can not describe the thermodynamic aspect of nuclear fragmentation .",
    "our present work started with the desire to have a model that can both describe the equation of state and the fragmentation of finite nuclear systems .",
    "the quintessence of this model is the lattice gas model @xcite .",
    "the model leads to a @xmath12 diagram , and it is also linked with the percolation model in an obvious way .",
    "an interesting feature is that it not only leads to a liquid - gas type of phase transition , but also encompasses the percolation transition .",
    "much work has been published on the subject of liquid - gas phase transition in nuclei .",
    "@xcite for description of some early works and @xcite for review .",
    "there are microscopic models which are proposed to calculate multifragmentation @xcite .",
    "other phenomenological models can be found in @xcite .",
    "the pioneering work by the purdue group @xcite was a big impetus for this subject .",
    "we consider the participant zone in collisions of two heavy ions and conjecture that because of nucleon - nucleon collisions the system reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "we assume that the system is adequately described by classical statistical mechanics . in that case",
    "the canonical partition function of an @xmath8-particle system can be written in a separable form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is given by @xmath15      d^3p_1 ...... d^3p_n \\label{z1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the other part of the partition function is @xmath17      d^3r_1 .... d^3r_n \\label{z2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is the potential between particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we approximate the configuration part of the partition function by the partition function of the lattice gas model . in this model",
    "( as in a site percolation model ) each lattice site can be occupied by at most one nucleon .",
    "the number of lattice sites , @xmath4 , gives a measure of the volume of the system and is usually larger than @xmath8 .",
    "when the nucleus is in the ground state we have @xmath21 .",
    "thus our model is limited to normal nuclear volume or higher .",
    "becuase cluster formation presumably takes place at a volume much larger than normal volume , this restriction may not be a debilitating factor .",
    "in contrast with the percolation model , the lattice gas model includes interactions . if two nearest neighboring sites are filled by nucleons they will interact and the energy of interaction is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "the nearest neighbor interaction simulates short range nature of nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we can now write down the canonical partition function for our model for a fixed @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath14 is simple and does not depend on the volume , and we just need to calculate the @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the number of @xmath25 bonds in a specific lattice configuration , the energy carried by these bonds is then @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath23 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a degeneracy factor satisfying @xmath29 an exact evaluation of @xmath23 given in ( [ z3 ] ) is difficult .",
    "thus we will use approximate means .",
    "the bragg - williams approximation is an easy and quick calculation but is not expected to be accurate .",
    "the results are , however , transparent and analytically demonstrate van der waals type behavior . in this approximation the number of @xmath25 bonds @xmath24 is taken to be given and fixed , when @xmath4 and @xmath8 are specified . if one site is definitely occupied , the number of its @xmath30 neighbors that are occupied is on the average @xmath31 . in our three dimensional simple cube lattice",
    "@xmath30 is 6 except at the boundary .",
    "since there are @xmath8 nucleons in the system , the number of @xmath25 bonds is then @xmath32 where we have ensured that each bond is only counted once and assumed that both @xmath8 and @xmath4 are large so that boundary effects can be neglected . in bragg - williams approximation",
    "the canonical partition function is then @xmath33 the equation of state can be calculated by utilizing @xmath34 since @xmath14 does not have any @xmath35 dependence . here",
    "@xmath36 is the pressure and @xmath35 is the volume given by @xmath37 .",
    "a representative value of @xmath38 would be @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normal nuclear density .",
    "the normal nuclear volume is @xmath42 . using stirling s approximation for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "one can show @xmath46 using @xmath47 we finally get @xmath48 this equation of state has the same qualitative behavior as the van der waals gas . for one mole of gas , the van der waals equation of state",
    "is @xmath49 the lattice gas pressure goes to infinity as @xmath35 approaches @xmath50 .",
    "the van der waals gas pressure goes to infinity as @xmath35 is squeezed to the value @xmath51 . for large @xmath35 both the equations of state approach the perfect gas limit .",
    "the critical point can be readily determined analytically from ( [ bwp ] ) . by setting @xmath52 at the critical point",
    "we obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that in the bragg - williams approximation @xmath55 for the lattice gas .",
    "the corresponding number for the van der waals gas is 0.375 .",
    "the bragg - williams approximation is considered to be crude and one may wonder if the lattice gas model would indeed lead to a liquid - gas type phase transition when a better mean - field calculation is done . in the next subsection",
    "we try an improved approximation .",
    "we now try to do a better mean field calculation and use what is called the bethe - peierls approximation in the ising model . for the ising model ,",
    "the order parameter can be computed without having to calculate the partition function but for the equation of state that we wish to calculate we will need to obtain the partition function .",
    "here we consider a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "to explain the methodology we refer to fig .",
    "1 where , for simplicity , a two dimensional square lattice is shown .",
    "we break up the lattices into @xmath56 blocks , each of which contains @xmath57 sites .",
    "the interactions within each block are treated exactly while the interactions between different blocks are taken into account approximately .",
    "the local correlations are taken into account in this approximation , and it is an improvement over bragg - williams approximation .",
    "the grand partition function can be written as the product of the grand partition functions of the @xmath56 blocks : @xmath58 the grand partition function of the block labeled by @xmath59 and 5 can be written as @xmath60 here @xmath61 plays the role of chemical potential .",
    "the energy @xmath62 consists of two parts ; the kinetic energy ( @xmath63 ) and the potential energy for nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "integration over the kinetic energy part can be immediately done to give a factor of @xmath64^k \\equiv e^{qk}$ ] .",
    "we now define @xmath65 and also divide the the right hand side of the above equation into two parts : @xmath66 the first part is proportional to the probability that site 5 is unoccupied and its neighboring sites @xmath67 are @xmath68-fold occupied where @xmath68 goes from 0 to @xmath30 .",
    "the second part is proportional to the probability that site 5 is occupied where an extra amount of energy @xmath69 is included when @xmath68 of the nearest neighbors are also occupied .",
    "the extra factor @xmath70 $ ] takes into account the interaction between different blocks . if we left this factor out the nucleon at site 1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) would only interact with the one at site 5 .    because of self - consistency condition the average occupation probability at every site must be the same .",
    "the average occupation at site 5 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is obtained from ( [ bp3 ] ) by summing over @xmath68 .",
    "the average number of particles in all the sites neighboring site 5 is @xmath73 the self - consistency condition then implies @xmath74 the two unknowns @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be solved from ( [ bp4 ] ) , ( [ bp5 ] ) and ( [ bp7 ] ) .",
    "divide both sides of ( [ bp7 ] ) by @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78^{\\gamma-1 } , \\label{bp8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and ( [ bp4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath79 use ( [ bp8 ] ) , ( [ bp9 ] ) becomes @xmath80 we can now write @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76 @xmath81 combining ( [ bp4 ] ) , ( [ bp5 ] ) and ( [ bp11 ] ) we obtain @xmath82 \\label{bp12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 the values of @xmath76 and @xmath75 can now be found from ( [ bp11 ] )  ( [ bp13 ] ) .",
    "we note here that the results depend on the ratios of @xmath84 and @xmath85 only .",
    "let us now go back to the partition function for the lattice given in ( [ bp1 ] ) where it is written as a product of the partition functions of the @xmath56 blocks .",
    "if we simply use the partition function for each block given in ( [ bp5 ] ) we count twice the binding energies between neighboring sites in different blocks .",
    "for example , the binding energy between 1 and 6 ( fig .",
    "1 ) is included in @xmath86 through @xmath76 , and it is included again in @xmath87 .",
    "we note that on the average there are @xmath84 particles at each site , and each block has @xmath30 peripheral sites .",
    "thus , when we evaluate the partition function for the lattice , the partition function for each block given in ( [ bp5 ] ) should be corrected with following factor : @xmath88 we can now use @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 to obtain @xmath92 here @xmath93 is now understood as the product of a block partition function given in ( [ bp5 ] ) and the correction factor given in ( [ bp14 ] ) .",
    "the equations of state calculated in bragg - williams approximation and bethe - peierls are compared in fig . 2 in @xmath94 diagrams at different temperature .",
    "it is seen that in high temperature limit both give the same results , and they begin to differ at low temperatures .",
    "we take a skyrme interaction with potential energy density given by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 mev , @xmath97 mev and @xmath98=7/6 .",
    "this interaction produces a saturation density of @xmath99 @xmath40 and binding energy of 16 mev per particle .",
    "the pressure consists of two parts : one originating from the interaction and the other from the kinetic energy .",
    "the pressure produced by the interaction is given by @xmath100\\rho .",
    "\\label{sk2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the kinetic pressure is calculated numerically from a fermi gas model at finite temperature .",
    "similar to fig . 2",
    "one can draw @xmath36 against @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) at various @xmath103 .",
    "a comparison of the equation of state in the mean field theory with skyrme interaction and in the lattice gas is shown in fig .",
    "3 . in both cases",
    "we see characteristics of liquid - gas phase transition . in the calculation we used @xmath104=9 mev and @xmath105 @xmath106 .",
    "nuclear fragmentations are described by the formation of clusters in our model . to generate fragements",
    "we need to simulate the lattice configuration and momenta of particles , and to determine if neighboring particles belong to the same cluster .",
    "the lattice configuration is generated according to the ( [ z2 ] ) , while the momenta are generated from maxwell - boltzmann factor given in ( [ z1 ] ) .",
    "these two processes are independent of each other since the partition function can be factorized . to generate the configuration we start from an empty lattice and put the first nucleon at random .",
    "once this has been put in the @xmath107 boxes that are immediate neighbours are assigned a probability @xmath108 $ ] whereas all other boxes have probability proportional to unity .",
    "the next nucleon is then put in according to this probability distribution .",
    "if at an intermediate state there are @xmath109 empty boxes we assign to each of these boxes a probability proportional to @xmath110 $ ] where @xmath111 is the number of nearest neighbors that are already filled up .",
    "the next filling is then done according to this distribution .",
    "the difference from the computer simulation that would be done in a site percolation model is the boltzmann factor .",
    "having done the configuration space sampling we then assign each nucleon a momentum according to maxwell - boltzmann distribution .    in a site percolation model two neighboring particles",
    "always form a cluster .",
    "the formation of a cluster in our model depends on the interactions of neighboring particles and their relative kinetic energy .",
    "we adopt the following physical criterion for determining the formation of a cluster .",
    "two neighboring nucleons belong to the same cluster if the following condition is satisfied @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the relative momentum between the two nucleons and @xmath114 is the reduced mass . except at very low temperatures , the frequency with which two nucleons appear at neighboring sites depends mostly on density .",
    "the probability of @xmath115 exceeding the value @xmath116 increases with temperature since the momenta of each nucleon is obtained from monte - carlo sampling of maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "hence the probability that two nucleons are bonded decreases with increasing temperature and the system becomes less compact at higher temperature as it should .",
    "a different parametrisation used in @xcite leads to similar effects .",
    "we note that when each particle obeys the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , the distribution of relative momentum between two particles is also maxwell - boltzmann , i.e. , @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "we can then write down a formula for bonding probability which is temperature - dependent : @xmath118    coniglio and klein @xcite used a different parametrisation for the bonding prbability .",
    "they used @xmath119 . \\label{a3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this was mathematically devised so that the thermal critical point would also be a percolation point , a feature , as we shall see , is also present in our parametrisation .",
    "a comparison of the two formulae is presented in fig .",
    "an example of fragment distribution obtained in our simulation is shown in fig .",
    "one could decipher from this figure that at @xmath120 the system percolates ; at @xmath121 and @xmath122 there is no percolation and that percolation sets in around @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the value of @xmath6 at the percolation point , i.e .",
    ", the point when an infinite cluster just appears .",
    "the cluster size distribution for a general @xmath6 can be parametrized as @xcite ; @xmath124 . \\label{general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the scaling function @xmath125 can be determined by computer simulations or experiments . in many cases , such as the fisher model @xcite",
    ", @xmath125 is an exponential function . at the percolation point",
    ", the fragment distribution obeys a simple power law @xmath126 at the percolation point the fluctuation is the maximum .",
    "this means that if in the neighborhood of the percolation point the yield @xmath127 is fitted by a power law , the exponent @xmath128 will be a minimum at the percolation point .",
    "experimental data are often fitted to a power law and a minimum in @xmath128 is searched to ascertain the percolation point @xcite .",
    "the second moment is defined as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the number of clusters with @xmath3 nucleons and the sum excludes the largest cluster ( defined henceforth as @xmath131 ) . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath0",
    "diverges at the percolation point and obeys a power law distribution @xmath132    as mentioned , the order parameter given by @xmath133 is zero for @xmath10 in and increases with @xmath6 for @xmath11 . above the percolation point",
    "the order parameter is given by @xmath134 there are two independent critical exponents in most statistical models and percolation models .",
    "one can readily show that following relations exist .",
    "@xmath135 @xmath136 and @xmath137    for a finite system the second moment @xmath0 goes through a maximum ( instead of infinity ) , and @xmath128 goes through a minimum at the percolation point . thus @xmath128 and @xmath0 can be used to identify percolation point in a finite system .    in our model",
    "there is , first of all , a thermal critical point which is obtained at @xmath53 and @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this more exact value of @xmath138 is smaller than the value of @xmath139 that we obtained from bragg - williams approximation .",
    "but , in addition , there is a continuous range of percolation points .",
    "provided the density is higher than a minimum value ( @xmath140 ) a percolation point will be reached at a certain temperature .",
    "the higher the density , the higher the temperature at which percolation sets in .",
    "if we identify the point at which a maximum in @xmath0 or a minimum in @xmath128 is achieved as the percolation point , then we see from figs . 6 and 7 that at higher density percolation point is reached at a higher temperature .",
    "one can now ask the question : if a minimum in @xmath128 is seen in experiments as in ref [ 19 ] , one could interpret that as an indication that the percolation point is reached but has it got any relevance with the thermal critical point ? as figure 7 shows if the freeze - out density is @xmath141 then the percolation point is reached at the thermal critical point .",
    "it also follows that if the freeze - out density is close to @xmath141 then a minimum in @xmath128 is obtained when the temperature of the dissociating system is close to the critical temperature .",
    "we therefore have this remarkable result which was not @xmath142 @xmath143 imposed . in our model",
    "the thermal critical point is also a percolation point .",
    "numerically this result can be explained by noting that at the critical temperature the value of @xmath6 in our model differs little from coniglio - klein parametrisation . at density @xmath144=1 , the system begins to percolate at @xmath145 in our model and at @xmath146 in coniglio - klein model .",
    "the implicit thinking in much of what is presented above is that in nuclear collisions matter is compressed , heated up and we can talk of a freeze - out density and temperature at the time of dissociation .",
    "both the temperature and the density are , however , not directly measurable . in the past values of @xmath147 and lower",
    "have been used for the freeze - out density .",
    "it is not known accurately . given that the most easily measurable quantities are the multiplicity ( number of charged particles),@xmath0 and @xmath131 , we ask",
    ": can we determine the freeze - out density from the multiplicity dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath131 ?",
    "in figs . 8 and 9",
    "we plot the @xmath0 and the @xmath131 as functions of the multiplicity at different densities . in the calculations , at a given density we took a sufficient large range of temperatures such that we cover the full range of multiplicity . for",
    "a given multiplicity both @xmath0 and @xmath131 can vary from one event to another .",
    "what is plotted is the average for a given multiplicity . from figs . 8 and 9 we can easily see the changes of @xmath0 and @xmath131 when the density is changed from @xmath148 to @xmath141 .",
    "the differences are however rather small between density @xmath141 to @xmath149 . remembering that there will always be uncertainties in experimental data due to contamination from pre - equilibrium particles , spectators etc .",
    ", we conclude that it is difficult from these observations alone to determine the freeze - out density accurately .",
    "some other variables might better differentiate between different freeze - out densities .",
    "fig . 6 shows that it may be possible that freeze - out density can be determined from the temperature dependence of @xmath128 .",
    "the temperature is not a direct observable in experiments although it has often been deduced indirectly from other data , notably from slopes of inclusive cross - sections . here",
    "we will first try to deduce the temperature from a simple theory so that the temperature is given once the beam energy is given .",
    "we consider the experimental setup of @xcite .",
    "one has nearly central collisions of two nearly equal ions .",
    "the experiment is carried out at various beam energies in the laboratory .",
    "we take the number of paticles to be 85 ( corresponding to central @xmath150ar+@xmath151sc collisions ) . in a purely classical model",
    "the ground state has no kinetic energy at zero temperature so that the ground state energy per nucleon is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the maximum number of @xmath25 bonds possible for particle number @xmath154 .",
    "since @xmath153 is determined by geometry we can use experimental binding energy ( @xmath155 mev/@xmath8 ) to fix the value of @xmath104 . at temperature",
    "@xmath103 the average energy per particle is @xmath156 where @xmath157 , the average value of @xmath24 is obtained from computer simulations .",
    "we can then write @xmath158 for equal mass non - relativistic nuclear collisions we have @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the beam energy per nucleon in the laboratory .",
    "there is an implicit assumption here that all available energy is converted to thermal energy .",
    "thus the temperature is related to the beam energy .",
    "we can now fix the freeze - out density at different values , obtain an effective @xmath161 at each beam energy and obtain points as in experiments @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig . 10 .",
    "however the fit with data is not good for any of the densities employed .",
    "this type of mapping between beam energy and temperature is not accurate .",
    "one of the sources of errors is the collective flow which is known to account for some fraction of the available energy .",
    "better mapping could be expected where temperature is deduced from other experimental data @xcite . in this approach , the tail of the proton cross - section",
    "is fitted by assuming that the proton has a maxwell - boltzmann distribution in a frame which is moving in the laboratory .",
    "we take this mapping from @xcite .",
    "when the mapping from this phenomenological approach is used , the fit with the experimental data is quite good when the freeze - out density is taken to be @xmath162 ( see fig .",
    "what is also very pleasing is that the predictions for different freeze - out densities are also sufficiently different to be experimentally accessible .",
    "the combined study of @xmath0 and @xmath128 as a function of beam energy should be useful in determining the freeze - out density .",
    "most of the attention in the present work has been focussed to temperatures that are close to what is believed to be the critical temperature of nuclear matter .",
    "indeed , in the past the percolation model has mostly been used for mild to moderate excitation energies . at higher energies ( i.e. , bevalac energies )",
    "other models have been used with moderate success .",
    "these models use approximations that are valid in the high temperature / low density limits .",
    "chemical equilibrium between different species is assumed .",
    "we will call these models by a generic name , the thermodynamic model . in this model",
    "rather simple expressions for the average number of monomers ( single nucleons@xmath163 ) , dimers ( clusters of two nucleons@xmath164 ) , three body clusters ( @xmath165 ) etc . can be obtained .",
    "an early review can be found in @xcite .",
    "we do not expect to find exact correspondence between these calculations and the present classical model at high temperature limits since we do not have quantum degeneracies .",
    "the clusters in our model consisting of attached cubical boxes in the lattice have degeneracies also . even for moderate sized clusters",
    "these degenaracies require considerable effort to enumerate analytically .",
    "nonetheless , many features seen in experiments are common in both the models .",
    "for example , in the thermodynamic model , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath165 vary with temperature but in a way that @xmath168 remains constant . here",
    "we have neglected the binding energy of the dimer with respect to @xmath169 . constancy for this ratio",
    "is obtained in our present model also .",
    "similarly @xmath170 is a constant in both the models .",
    "the so called coalescence relation @xmath171 is obeyed in both the models .",
    "thus rather reasonable features emerge when the model is extrapolated to the high temperature side .",
    "-0.5 cm    we have presented a model that has links with both mean field aspects and fragmentation of nuclei .",
    "we studied the equation of state under different approximations .",
    "the model shows a liquid - gas type phase transition .",
    "we also studied the nuclear fragmantaion and discussed the critical exponents near critical or percolation points . some comparisons with experimental data",
    "were made .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to present the essentials of this model .",
    "the issues we addressed here are far from exclusive .",
    "many other features may be further explored .",
    "the present model , we believe , is one step forward from the percolation model which was proved to be helpful for the analysis of experimental data .    -0.5",
