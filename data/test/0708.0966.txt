    "one of the most exciting recent discoveries in astrophysics is that the nearest observed long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with supernovae ( sne ) ( e.g. ,  grb980425/sn1998bw , @xcite ; grb030329/sn2003dh , @xcite ; grb031203/sn2003lw , @xcite ) . adding to the excitement , it turned out that these sne are not at all ordinary .",
    "spectroscopically , they are of type ic ( no h , no he , weak si lines ; see @xcite for a review of sn classification ) , but their distinguishing feature is that unlike normal sne  ic , they show extremely broad absorption lines dominated by fe , ca , and o. very high expansion velocities , reaching @xmath6 , are easily observed at early times .",
    "broad lines suggest a very energetic explosion , or at least a large amount of energy per unit mass .",
    "estimates of the explosion kinetic energy assuming spherical symmetry for sne 1998bw , 2003dh , and 2003lw are @xmath7@xmath8erg",
    "( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is more than one order of magnitude larger than in typical core - collapse sne , which have @xmath7@xmath9erg .",
    "accordingly , these exceptionally powerful sne have sometimes been called `` hypernovae '' ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the presence of significant deviations from spherical symmetry , these estimates may be reduced , but even then the energies remain large ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . the mechanism behind these events is thought to be the collapse of the stripped core of a massive star ( @xmath10 ) to a black hole @xcite .",
    "additionally , evidence has been obtained that x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , the soft analogues of grbs @xcite , are also linked to sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sne associated with xrfs also seem to be overenergetic , but not as much so as grb - sne @xcite .",
    "they have been suggested to be the result of the collapse of the stripped carbon - oxygen core of stars of originally @xmath11 to a neutron star @xcite . if the neutron star is born highly magnetized and rapidly spinning",
    " a `` magnetar '' @xcite  it may cause the explosion to be overenergetic and produce the xrf @xcite .",
    "one difference between sne in grbs and xrfs may be the degree of asphericity .",
    "grb - sne are thought to be highly aspherical , as grbs are generally believed to be highly asymmetric phenomena ( see @xcite for a recent review of the sn - grb connection ) . for xrf - sne",
    ", the degree of asphericity may be smaller @xcite .",
    "evidence for asphericity is not easy to glean from early - time data .",
    "the significant mixing outward of @xmath2ni  required to reproduce the early rise of the light curve is a general feature of hypernovae @xcite and suggests an aspherical explosion , as does the connection of these sne with grbs .",
    "the best time to look for signatures of asphericity , however , is starting a few months after the explosion , when the sn becomes nebular , exposing the deepest parts of the ejecta . in that phase , both the spectrum and the light curve",
    "have a characteristic behavior .",
    "the light curve of sn1998bw showed a phase of strictly exponential decline , but at a rate steeper than that of @xmath2co  @xcite . in this phase",
    "the luminosity is larger than what is predicted by spherically symmetric models that fit the peak of the light curve @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this behavior , which is actually not unusual in sne  ic , can be explained using a modified spherically symmetric model where a relatively massive but slowly expanding inner core is placed in the center of the expanding ejecta .",
    "although this is technically still a spherically symmetric model , one - dimensional explosion simulations do not predict such a density distribution , which suggests that we are observing an aspherical explosion , similar perhaps to the collapsar model of @xcite .",
    "the nebular spectra provide more direct evidence . in sn1998bw the [ fe  ii ]",
    "lines are broader than the [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 doublet @xcite .",
    "this is also something that can not be explained in the context of a spherically symmetric model of the collapse and explosion of a co core , as in such a model @xmath2ni  ( which decays into @xmath2co and then into @xmath2fe ) is synthesized near the compact remnant and therefore is always located at smaller velocities than o , which is left from the progenitor in the unprocessed outer layers .",
    "@xcite showed that this configuration can be obtained in an axisymmetric explosion .",
    "in such an explosion , most of the @xmath7  is released along the `` jet '' axis , which is probably linked to the launching of the grb , and @xmath2ni  is synthesized along that direction and ejected at a high velocity . away from the jet axis , however , less kinetic energy is deposited and burning proceeds much less efficiently .",
    "therefore , in these directions large amounts of unburned o are ejected at low velocity . for a near - polar viewing angle",
    ", this scenario naturally leads to broad [ fe  ii ] lines and a narrow [ o  i ] line at late times . for an equatorial view , on the other hand , the [ o  i ] line should have a characteristic double - peaked profile @xcite , as was indeed observed in the sn  ic 2003jd @xcite",
    "further evidence that sne  ic are aspherical also comes from their high degree of polarization @xcite .    for xrf / sne ,",
    "the case for asphericity is much weaker .",
    "the early - time spectra of sn2006aj did not show very broad features @xcite .",
    "radio observations @xcite suggest a very broad opening angle ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the broad nebular lines are not inconsistent with spherically symmetric ejecta @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of emission at velocities below 2000 km  s@xmath14  is at odds with the prediction of one - dimensional explosion models , that a density hole is present at the lowest velocities @xcite .    besides those clearly associated with grbs or xrfs , other energetic sne ic have been observed .",
    "energetic sne  ic , with or without a grb , are recognized from the extreme width ( up to @xmath15 ) of their spectral lines at early times , and have sometimes also been called hypernovae ( although their total energy is not always much higher than that of normal sne  ic ) .",
    "the nearest such object ever observed was sn2002ap in m74 .",
    "sn2002ap was immediately recognized as a broad - lined event , similar spectroscopically to sn1998bw @xcite , and was therefore intensively observed .",
    "sn2002ap remained much less luminous than sn1998bw @xcite , and it was not significantly more luminous than the average sn  ic .",
    "also , sn2002ap was not seen in association with a grb @xcite .",
    "@xcite modelled the early - time light curve and spectral evolution of sn2002ap and derived values of the ejected mass ( @xmath16@xmath17 ) , the kinetic energy of the explosion ( @xmath7@xmath18erg ) , and the mass of @xmath2ni  synthesised in the explosion ( @xmath19(@xmath2ni)@xmath20 ) . while the mass of @xmath2ni  is similar to that of `` normal '' sne  ic @xcite , and much smaller than that of hypernovae linked to grbs",
    ", both @xmath16  and @xmath7  are intermediate between those of normal sne  ib / c and grb - sne .",
    "the uncertainty in the values of @xmath16  and @xmath7  follows from assuming either the absence of any he envelope ( lower bound ) or the presence of a maximal , @xmath21 helium envelope , the presence of which would not affect the light curve significantly but is at the same time not supported by the spectral appearance of sn2002ap .",
    "interestingly , the light - curve behavior at advanced phases was very similar to that of sn1998bw @xcite , suggesting a common nature for the two events .",
    "@xcite argued that sn2002ap was the @xmath22 carbon - oxygen core of a star of initially @xmath23 that collapsed to a black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "no grb was detected , only weak radio emission was detected from the sn @xcite , and the x - ray signal was very weak @xcite , suggesting that little or no relativistic ejecta were produced .",
    "this may be related to the relatively small mass of the collapsing star , which may have been close to the minimum required to form a black hole .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore further the nature of this object . as in the case of sne1998bw and sn2006aj ,",
    "this can be done by modelling the nebular spectra .",
    "@xcite published a series of late - time spectra of sn2002ap , while @xcite published a single spectrum .",
    "the nebular phase in sn2002ap started to develop rather early , as in sn1998bw but unlike other hypernovae such as sn1997ef @xcite .",
    "at an age of @xmath24 months , the sn spectra were already fully nebular @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra were dominated by very strong [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 emission , and showed strong ca  iiemission lines , similar to sn1998bw . unlike the case of sn1998bw , however , the [ fe  ii]-dominated blend near 5200    is rather weak .",
    "this is not surprising , since sn1998bw is thought to have produced @xmath24 times as much @xmath2ni  as sn2002ap @xcite .",
    "still , the [ fe  ii ] lines in sn2002ap are sufficiently pronounced that modelling can be meaningfully attempted .",
    "one peculiarity of sn2002ap is the great strength of the mg  i ] @xmath124571 line , which may suggest that the envelope of sn2002ap was more thoroughly stripped than that of sn1998bw .",
    "this would favor the lower bound of the mass and energy estimates of @xcite , which were obtained assuming the absence of any significant he layer .",
    "in this paper , we model all the spectra published by @xcite .",
    "additionally , we present and model three additional late - time spectra .",
    "two of these spectra were obtained with the subaru telescope .",
    "the other spectrum was obtained at the national astronomical observatory of china ( naoc , formerly beijing astronomical observatory , bao ) .",
    "the subaru spectra were obtained on 2002 jun 7.6 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) and sep 15.6 with focas . for both spectra ,",
    "the exposure time was 240 s , and grism b300 and y47 order - cut filters were used .",
    "a @xmath25 wide slit was used for the june spectrum and the resulting spectral resolution ( @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 . for the september spectrum ,",
    "a @xmath28 slit was used , but the spectral resolution is still similar to that of the june spectrum because the seeing size was @xmath29@xmath25 .",
    "the flux was calibrated using observations of either feige 110 or g191b2b obtained on the same night as the target spectra .",
    "the bao spectrum was obtained on 2002 july 11.8 with the naoc 2.16  m telescope at xinlong observatory ( then bao ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with an omr ( optomechanics research , inc . )",
    "spectrograph , using a tektronix @xmath30 pixel ccd as the detector .",
    "a grating of 300 g mm@xmath14 was used , which provided a spectral resolution of @xmath31   .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath32 min .",
    "the newly published spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the naoc spectrum is reasonably consistent with the almost contemporaneous lick spectrum published by @xcite , and therefore it was modelled but is not explicitly shown in the figures in the following sections .",
    "the 11 spectra we used for modelling cover a time span of almost 9 months , from june 2002 through february 2003 , corresponding to sn ages of 413 months given that the sn exploded on 29 january 2002 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the wavelength coverage is not uniform . in particular ,",
    "the subaru spectra extend over a shorter range ( 47009000 ) than the other spectra , missing the important mg  i ] line .",
    "models based on the subaru spectra are therefore somewhat less reliable than those based on the lick spectra .",
    "all spectra were calibrated by using the available photometry @xcite with the exception of the last three , for which an extrapolation of the light curve was used .",
    "in order to model the nebular spectra of sn2002ap , we used our non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) code @xcite .",
    "the code computes the heating of the gas following the deposition of @xmath0-rays and positrons emitted by the decay of @xmath2co  into @xmath2fe .",
    "heating is balanced by cooling via nebular line emission .",
    "the emission rate in each line is computed solving a non - lte matrix of level populations @xcite . in the original version @xcite",
    ", a homologously expanding nebula of finite extent , uniform density , and uniform composition is assumed , and the emission spectrum is obtained assigning to all lines a parabolic profile , bounded by the velocity of the outer edge of the nebula",
    ".    together with this classical version , a more advanced  although more model - dependent  version has been developed and is used in this work . in this new version , stratification in density and abundance is adopted .",
    "the density profile is taken from explosion models , and @xmath0-rays and positrons are emitted at various depths according to the distribution of @xmath2ni .",
    "their propagation and deposition is followed using a monte carlo scheme similar to that discussed by @xcite for their light - curve models .",
    "a constant @xmath0-ray opacity ( @xmath33@xmath34g@xmath14 ) and a constant positron opacity ( @xmath35@xmath34g@xmath14 ) are assumed .",
    "the heating and cooling of the gas are then computed in non - lte in each radial shell , and so is the line emissivity .",
    "the line profiles from each shell are assumed to be truncated parabolas , the inner truncation point corresponding to the inner boundary of the shell considered .",
    "these truncated parabolas are then summed to produce the emerging spectrum .",
    "line profiles thus depend on the density and abundance distributions .",
    "therefore , this approach constitutes a test of the explosion models which are used to simulate the light curves and the early - time spectra , especially for what concerns the innermost part , which is only visible directly in the nebular phase .    because the stratified code depends more directly on the adopted explosion model than the one - zone version , it is useful to compare the results of the two approaches .",
    "the next two sections deal with both cases in turn .    one important ingredient for the modelling is the assumed distance and reddening to the sn .",
    "in the case of sn2002ap , the distance is highly uncertain , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using the brightest blue supergiant stars , obtained a distance modulus of @xmath36 mag for m74 , and @xmath37 mag for the m74 group , confirming previous results by @xcite , who preferred to use red supergiants .",
    "as @xcite comment , this value was derived using the galactic absorption maps of @xcite , which give a value of the total absorption in the @xmath38 band of @xmath39 mag . on the other hand ,",
    "the more recent maps published by @xcite predict a larger absorption , @xmath40 mag , leading to a reduced distance , @xmath41 mag .    as for the reddening , combining the galactic extinction of @xcite , @xmath42 mag , with the small reddening within m74 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath43 mag ) , a total value of @xmath44 mag is used .",
    "clearly , the uncertainty associated with the distance is the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty on the luminosity of sn2002ap .",
    "therefore , in this paper we have chosen to adopt the same values used in previous modelling and analysis papers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( @xmath37 mag , @xmath44 mag ) ) in order to make the results immediately comparable",
    ". the effect of adopting a different value for the distance is discussed below .",
    "the driving parameters for the one - zone fits are the line width , the mass of @xmath2ni , and the masses of the other elements . fitting the widths of the complex [ fe  ii ] blend near 5200",
    "  gives a measure of the distribution of @xmath2ni , since most fe is the product of the decay of @xmath2ni .",
    "this blend can be fitted for a nebular velocity of between 6200 and 5200 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the line width slowly decreases over the period considered , which is in good agreement with what was found for sn1998bw @xcite , although in that case the velocities were significantly larger .",
    "this behavior indicates that the outer parts of the ejecta are becoming progressively more difficult to excite as the density decreases owing to the expansion . unlike the case of sn1998bw",
    ", however , the velocity that is required to fit the [ fe  ii ] lines is also appropriate for the [ o  i ] line .",
    "this is typical of lower - energy sne  ic ( e.g. ,  sn1994i , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indicates that the degree of asphericity of the explosion is small .",
    "the only apparent deviation from sphericity is the presence of narrow emission spikes in the cores of [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 and mg  i ] @xmath454571 , at velocities below 2000 km  s@xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 17 ) .",
    "such a feature was also observed in sn2006aj @xcite .",
    "the masses of the other elements are determined by fitting the various emission lines .",
    "one caveat is that two intermediate - mass elements that are expected to be abundant in the sn ejecta are only diagnosed by a single line .",
    "the only line of sulfur is [ s  i ] @xmath124069 , which is blended with various fe lines .",
    "silicon , a highly abundant element , also has no strong or isolated line at optical wavelenghts .",
    "a shoulder on the red side of [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 may be due to [ si  i ] @xmath456527 .",
    "we have determined the masses of si and s by trying to reproduce those two features , but the uncertainty involved is large , affecting also the estimate of the mass in the ejecta .",
    "in fact , both silicon and sulfur have strong lines in the infrared ( [ si  i ] 1.61 , 1.65 @xmath46 m , [ s  i ] 1.08 , 1.13 @xmath46 m ) , which act as efficient coolants .",
    "thus , increasing the mass of these two elements requires all other masses , including that of @xmath2ni , to be increased . additionally ,",
    "since in the later spectra it is not possible to reproduce accurately the red shoulder of the [ o  i ] line , there may be some doubt as to the actual contribution of silicon to that feature .",
    "more accurate statements about the masses of these elements would require the availability of infrared spectra .    as in sn1998bw ,",
    "the spectra of sn2002ap show lines of [ fe  ii ] , but not [ fe  iii ] .",
    "this implies a rather low degree of ionization , which can be reproduced assuming significant clumping to favor recombination . as in @xcite ,",
    "a volume filling factor of 0.1 was adopted in all models to achieve this .",
    "the models with stratified density and composition discussed in the next section are useful to address this issue .    the results are summarized in table 2 , and the time series of the spectral fits is shown in figures 1 and 2 . the electron temperature and density in the nebula decrease with time .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath19(@xmath2ni ) is @xmath47 .",
    "small oscillations around this value in the various fits are probably due to a combination of inconsistent flux calibration and incomplete wavelength coverage , in particular for spectra that do not include the mg  i ] line . only in the two very late - time spectra",
    "does the @xmath2ni  mass increase significantly , but these spectra are calibrated in flux using an extrapolation of the observed photometry , making the results less reliable .    in order to fit the spectra , we require an ejected mass of @xmath48 below a velocity of 5500 km  s@xmath14 . of this mass",
    ", @xmath49 is oxygen . the density profile ( co100/4 ) used by @xcite to fit the early - time light curve and spectra only contained @xmath50 below the same velocity .",
    "interestingly , the larger mass is in good agreement with the results of @xcite , who used a two - component , one - dimensional density distribution to reproduce the light curve of sn2002ap and obtained a @xmath2ni  mass of @xmath51 and an ejected mass of @xmath52 below 5750 km  s@xmath14  ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the mass at low velocity may be somewhat overestimated by the one - zone models , which overfit the flux at the lowest velocities where the observed [ o  i ] line has a narrow core , the need for additional mass at low velocity is clear .",
    "similar results were also obtained for other sne  ic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they suggest the presence of a dense , oxygen - rich core in the ejecta , which would be most naturally explained as the result of an aspherical explosion .",
    "one place where our models fail is the emission near 7700   .",
    "this is likely to be o  i @xmath457774 .",
    "the excitation temperature of this line is significantly higher than the nebular temperatures obtained in our models , suggesting that the flux in the line may be caused by recombination or non - thermal excitation by fast electrons .",
    "therefore , while the results from the one - zone models generally confirm findings from the light curve and spectral study of @xcite , they suggest that the improvements introduced by @xcite are realistic , and that a simple one - dimensional explosion model is not sufficient to explain the behavior of sn2002ap .",
    "we have modelled the same 11 spectra of sn2002ap with the multi - zone code described in section 2 . as a model of the explosion , we selected co100/4 , which was used by @xcite to fit the early - time light curve and spectra of sn2002ap .",
    "our multi - zone code is still one - dimensional , but by allowing us to investigate the element distribution in velocity space at an epoch when the ejecta are fully transparent , it can give us indirect clues of possible asymmetries through unusual abundance distributions .",
    "therefore , although we started our models using the density profile and the abundances of co100/4 , we allowed the abundances to vary so as to achieve the best possible fit to the data . repeating",
    "this exercise over several epochs ensures the validity of the results .    also , because the ejecta are assumed to be fully transparent , once the abundance distribution has been defined from fitting one spectrum",
    ", it should not need to be changed to reproduce the other epochs .",
    "ideally , this should be done with the earliest nebular spectrum , since this is likely to show emission from a broader range of velocities than later spectra , as discussed in the previous section .    since the first spectrum of our series does not cover the mg  i ] @xmath454571 line , which is an important coolant , we used as reference the lick observatory 8 june 2002 spectrum , which offers very broad wavelength coverage at a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the model used to fit that spectrum gave good results for the other spectra , with only small changes in composition , which may be attributed to the variable observing conditions and flux calibration .",
    "the series of our synthetic spectra is shown in figures 4 and 5 . in order to reproduce the width of the [ fe  ii ] lines ,",
    "the mass fraction of @xmath2ni  must be small ( @xmath53% ) at @xmath54 km  s@xmath14 , and then slowly increase inward , reaching @xmath55% at @xmath56 km  s@xmath14 . at the lowest velocities , below 3000 km  s@xmath14 , the abundance drops again to @xmath57% .",
    "for the highest velocities ( @xmath58 km  s@xmath14 ) , the value of the abundance derived from the early - time modelling ( @xmath55% ) was used , but this does not affect the nebular spectra .",
    "the oxygen mass fraction , on the other hand , does not change significantly with velocity .",
    "it is @xmath59% at @xmath60 km  s@xmath14 , decreasing to @xmath32% at @xmath61 km  s@xmath14 , a region that is dominated by @xmath2ni , si , and s. the abundance of s was determined from the weak [ s  i ] @xmath454069 line , and the si abundance was assumed to have a constant ratio of 3:1 with respect to that of s. with this assumption , the emission on the red side of the [ o  i ] line is not fully reproduced , suggesting that [ si  ii ] is not the only line contributing to it , or that a larger mass , or a larger si / s ratio should be adopted .",
    "other elements behave as expected .",
    "the mg and ca abundances also increase inward , while c decreases with o.    one problem using model co100/4 is that the strong , narrow cores of [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 and mg  i ] @xmath454571 can not be reproduced .",
    "the characteristic velocities of these cores are in fact @xmath62 km  s@xmath14 , but co100/4 has a density `` hole '' at @xmath63 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "therefore , following @xcite , we added a dense inner region at @xmath63 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the composition of this region must be dominated by o , with c , mg , and other intermediate - mass elements also present so that the line cores can be reproduced .",
    "however , only little @xmath2fe  must be present there , or the [ fe  ii ] feature would be negatively affected .",
    "this inner zone contains only @xmath64 of material , mostly oxygen .",
    "the total @xmath2ni  mass below 3000 km  s@xmath14  is @xmath65 , in agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "the oxygen mass below 5750 km  s@xmath14  in these models is @xmath66 , which is significantly less than in the one - zone models .",
    "the total @xmath2ni  mass is , however , slightly larger ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the total ejected mass is @xmath16@xmath68 , of which @xmath69 is oxygen .",
    "the main results obtained from the multi - zone models are recapped in table 2 .",
    "the last two spectra again require a somewhat larger @xmath2ni  mass .",
    "because of the uncertain flux calibration of these spectra , we do not regard this as an inconsistency of our modelling procedure .",
    "the oxygen mass is , however , much more stable than in the one - zone models , showing that the multi - zone approach is more accurate , and that the explosion model that we used is a good representation of the ejecta of sn2002ap in the late phase as well as the early phase .",
    "one further point concerns clumping . introducing a density gradient should reduce the ionization degree at low velocity .",
    "thus , it may be expected that in the stratified models clumping would not be necessary . however , even in these models , if clumping is not used the fe ionization is too high at all velocities .",
    "a filling factor of 0.1 was therefore used in all zones with @xmath70 km  s@xmath14 that is , wherever @xmath2ni  is present .",
    "no clumping is necessary in the o - dominated inner zone , below 2000 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for this .",
    "one is that clumping does indeed exist .",
    "the lack of direct evidence ( e.g. ,  narrow emission features at different velocities ) suggests that any clumps must be small and evenly distributed in velocity space .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath2ni  is located mostly near the jet direction in an axisymmetric explosion . in this case",
    ", the actual density of fe in the effectively emitting volume in the nebular phase would be higher than what is suggested by a spherically symmetric approach like the one used here .",
    "clumping would then be a proxy for this aspherical distribution .",
    "the total mass estimate would not be affected , since in the nebular phase each emitting ion contributes to the line profile , independent of its position .",
    "an axisymmetric configuration was indeed suggested for the outer part of the ejecta as a possible interpretation of the detection of significant line polarization in the early - time spectra of sn2002ap @xcite .",
    "if significant asymmetry affected the inner part of the ejecta , the profiles of the nebular emission lines would depend sensitively on viewing angle , as demonstrated by @xcite for sn1998bw .",
    "however , in this case the lack of a coincident grb and of dramatic signatures of asphericity in the nebular spectra suggest that any deep asphericity was most likely weak .",
    "we have modelled a series of nebular spectra of the broad - lined sn2002ap , using a one - zone non - lte code and a multi - zone code where @xmath0-ray deposition and line emission are computed more accurately based on a pre - defined explosion model .",
    "both simulations yield a good reproduction of the [ fe  ii ] lines , but the narrow cores observed in [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 can only be reproduced assuming the presence of a dense , o - dominated inner zone . in the one - zone synthetic spectra ,",
    "a mass excess of @xmath71 is needed to reproduce qualitatively the [ o  i ] emission line . in the multi - zone model , which reproduces the line profiles much more accurately ,",
    "the mass excess is smaller , @xmath72 , but the presence of oxygen - dominated material moving at low velocity is confirmed . this material is not predicted by one - dimensional explosion models , but its presence was suggested in various hypernovae based on light - curve studies @xcite .",
    "similar results were also obtained for the normal snic 1994i @xcite as well as for the xrf / sn 2006aj @xcite .",
    "sn1994i shows emission in the [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 line at velocities below @xmath73 km  s@xmath14  @xcite , while the corresponding one - dimensional explosion model predicts the absence of material at low velocities .",
    "the rounded profile suggests a smooth distribution of oxygen , which does not by itself indicate an aspherical explosion , but the very presence of material does , and it can be modelled adding @xmath74 of oxygen - dominated mass at low velocity .",
    "sn2006aj shows a peak in [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 at velocities below 2000 km  s@xmath14 , although not quite as sharp as in sn2002ap ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this was modelled for a mass excess of @xmath75 over the one - dimensional explosion model @xcite .",
    "the presence of a dense inner zone in all sne  ic suggests that these explosions are intrinsically aspherical , as is also deduced from polarization studies @xcite .",
    "figure  6 shows a comparison of the [ o  i ] @xmath126300 , 6363 line in sn2002ap , and in sne2006aj , 1998bw , and 2003jd ( mazzali et al .",
    "2007 , 2001 , and 2005 , respectively ) .",
    "the line in sn2006aj has a full - width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) of @xmath76 km  s@xmath14 , while for the other three sne the fwhm is @xmath77 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the line profile in sn2006aj is not very sharp , indicating that the nebula is to a good approximation spherically symmetric @xcite . in this case",
    "the [ o  i ] line velocity should correspond to the real expansion velocity .",
    "the sharp profile in sn1998bw was interpreted as a disk - like distribution of oxygen viewed from a near - polar direction . although the low observed velocity is partly the result of a projection effect , the actual velocity of the oxygen ( @xmath76 km  s@xmath14 ) is smaller than the velocity of fe @xcite .",
    "the [ o  i ] line of sn2003jd has a width similar to that of sn1998bw , but the double - peaked profile suggests that we are viewing the oxygen - rich disk from near its plane @xcite .",
    "the case of sn2002ap seems intermediate between those of sne  1998bw and 2006aj .",
    "the line can be separated into two components .",
    "a broad base , of width similar to that in sne 1998bw and 2003jd , is present down to velocities of @xmath78 km  s@xmath14  and is well fitted by a one - zone model .",
    "its profile is reminiscent of that of sn2003jd , but the presence of the sharp core makes it impossible to distinguish between a flat - topped profile , characteristic of a shell - like spherical distribution , and a double - peaked profile as in a disk viewed edge - on .",
    "this core is narrower than even the corresponding profile of sn1998bw .    there may be two explanations for this type of profile .",
    "one is that in sn2002ap the outer part of the oxygen , from @xmath79 out to @xmath80 km  s@xmath14 , has a distribution that is not far from spherical , giving rise to a flat - topped profile . below @xmath78 km  s@xmath14 ,",
    "on the other hand , we may be seeing a situation qualitatively similar to that of sn1998bw , with the oxygen distributed in a disk - like region oriented not far from face - on .",
    "the size and mass of this disk - like region are , however , much smaller in sn2002ap than in sn1998bw .",
    "the other possibility is that the outer part reflects a disk - like distribution of most of the oxygen viewed not far from its plane , like in sn2003jd .",
    "the broad component of the profile would then be double - peaked rather than flat - topped , and the inner component would contain more mass , so that its emission could fill the valley between the two peaks .",
    "the sharpness of this inner - component emission may again indicate a disk - like distribution viewed face - on , but in this case two main orientations would exist in the ejecta , which may not be easy to explain in terms of the collapse mechanism .",
    "alternatively , the inner region could simply be sharply peaked in density , as reproduced by our multi - zone model , but not grossly aspherical .    in both scenarios",
    "the lack of a grb may be justified .",
    "if the inner explosion was aspherical , but the asphericity did not propagate to the intermediate part of the ejecta ( 3000 to @xmath81 km  s@xmath14 ) , it is unlikely that a beam of material moving at relativistic velocities was produced , yet the overenergetic explosion could have caused enough material to move at high velocities ( @xmath82 km  s@xmath14 ) , giving rise to the broad absorption features in the early spectra .",
    "the distribution of this material may not have been very far from spherical : polarization studies @xcite suggest a degree of asphericity of @xmath55% . on the other hand ,",
    "if the outer explosion was aspherical , a relativistic jet may have been produced , but it would not have been pointing to us .",
    "this latter possibility is , however , not supported by the lack of an x - ray detection @xcite and the weakness of the radio signal @xcite , so we tend to favor an explosion that was not far from spherical , except in the innermost part .",
    "both simulations agree that the @xmath2ni  mass ejected by sn2002ap is @xmath83 , a slightly larger value than that predicted by studies of the early - time light curve @xcite , but in agreement with the late - time light curve @xcite .",
    "the multi - zone model confirms that only a small fraction of this ( @xmath65 ) is located in the innermost zone , a clear indication that the explosion was asymmetric to some degree .",
    "other global values that can be derived rather accurately from a one - dimensional study of the nebular spectra ( @xmath19(@xmath2ni)@xmath84 , @xmath16@xmath68 ) are small compared to those of other broad - lined sne , confirming previous results based on the early - time light curve and spectra .",
    "these values point to a progenitor less massive than for objects such as sn 1998bw or sn 2003dh , although still a massive star ( @xmath85 ) that could have produced a black hole .",
    "this also suggests that the `` hypernova '' properties of sn2002ap were less extreme , including asymmetry and the launching of a grb",
    ".    the estimated mass of @xmath2ni  would be smaller if we adopted a shorter distance .",
    "if the distance modulus was @xmath41 mag , the @xmath2ni  mass would be reduced by @xmath86% .",
    "the mass and energy of the ejecta would also be similarly reduced , but the change is sufficiently small that the shape of the light curve would not be affected .",
    "indirect indications of asymmetry can be obtained in our one - dimensional study , but the details of the exact properties are not .",
    "the development of axisymmetric explosion models suitable for sn2002ap , and the study of the nebular spectra using three - dimensional spectrum synthesis codes as in @xcite , are currently planned .",
