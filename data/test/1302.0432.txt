    "solving matrix eigenvalue problems is crucial in many scientific and engineering applications .",
    "robust solvers for problems of moderate size are well developed and widely available  @xcite .",
    "these are sometimes referred to as direct solvers  @xcite .",
    "direct solvers typically calculate the entire spectrum of the matrix or matrix pencil in question . yet in many applications , especially for those where the underlying linear systems are large and sparse , it is often the case that only selected segments of the spectrum are of interest .",
    "polizzi recently proposed a density - matrix - based algorithm  @xcite named feast for hermitian eigenproblems of this kind . from an implementation point of view , feast s main building block is a numerical - quadrature computation , consisting of solving independent linear systems , each for multiple right hand sides .",
    "this building block contains multiple levels of parallelism and thus exploits the features of modern computing architectures very well .",
    "a software package feast  @xcite based on this approach has been made available since 2009 .",
    "nevertheless , theoretical analysis of feast has been lagging its software development . in particular",
    ", there is no theoretical study available on the conditions under which feast converges , and if so , at what rate .",
    "this paper shows that the feast algorithm can be understood as a standard subspace iteration in conjunction with the rayleigh - ritz procedure .",
    "feast therefore belongs to the class of projection methods that typically construct bases to particular subspaces and then obtain the corresponding ritz values and vectors .",
    "( for example , see  @xcite chapter 6 . ) in krylov projection methods such as lanczos  @xcite or arnoldi  @xcite , the subspace at iteration @xmath0 is spanned by a set of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the matrix in question .",
    "the dimensions of the subspaces grow as iterations proceed .",
    "the initial vector @xmath3 can be chosen at random , or constructed carefully including the use of a `` filter '' @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "filters are often called accelerators because they can hasten convergence when chosen appropriately .",
    "we use the two terms interchangeably throughout this paper . very often , the accelerator @xmath6 is a polynomial in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "jacobi - davidson  @xcite is another notable projection method on expanding subspaces .",
    "more recently , sakurai and sugiura  @xcite proposed a projection method ( ss - projection ) that uses certain moment matrices .",
    "ss - projection is subsequently recognized as a krylov method in  @xcite ( see theorem 7 ) and generalized to a block krylov method  @xcite . in the terminology of filtered krylov methods , the subspaces in ss - projection",
    "are spanned by sets of the form @xmath7 where @xmath3 is a filtered random vector @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath5 is chosen randomly , @xmath9 approximates a zeroth - moment matrix , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , approximates a @xmath12-th moment matrix .",
    "in contrast to these methods that project onto expanding subspaces , there is a class of projection methods that project onto subspaces of a fixed dimension .",
    "the subspaces , but not their dimensions , change as iterations proceed .",
    "trace minimization  @xcite is one example of such methods , but the classical representative is subspace iterations ( see  @xcite or discussions in standard textbooks such as  @xcite ) . here",
    "the @xmath13-dimensional subspaces are spanned by vectors of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 consists of @xmath13 vectors chosen randomly .",
    "accelerators ( filters ) can be applied so that the subspaces are spanned instead by vectors of the form @xmath16 .",
    "the accelerators @xmath17 can be the same for all @xmath12 , or can be made adaptive to exploit new information gained as iterations proceed . in this context , we show that feast is a subspace iteration accelerated by a non - adaptive accelerator @xmath18 for all @xmath12 where @xmath6 approximates the spectral projector to the invariant eigenspace in question .",
    "this accelerator @xmath6 in fact corresponds to the approximate zeroth - moment matrix @xmath9 in the ss - projection method .",
    "both filters are constructed in a similar way , exploiting the cauchy integral formula . nevertheless , as mentioned previously",
    ", ss - projection is fundamentally a krylov method that uses subspaces spanned by sets of the form @xmath19 , @xmath3 being a filtered starting vector : @xmath8 for some randomly chosen @xmath5 .",
    "the matrices @xmath10 , @xmath11 , approximate the @xmath12-th moment matrices .",
    "in contrast , feast is fundamentally a subspace iteration eigensolver .",
    "it uses subspaces spanned by sets of the form @xmath20 . note that @xmath21 does not approximate the @xmath12-th moment matrix at all , but rather approximates the spectral projector progressively better as @xmath12 advances .",
    "standard theory in the literature readily establishes feast s convergence as soon as we identify it as an accelerated subspace iteration .",
    "nevertheless , to fully understand the algorithm s fast convergence and possible modes of failure , detailed analysis specific to the use feast s accelerator is carried out in this paper .",
    "furthermore , this analysis allows us to improve the robustness of the original algorithm that was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting enhancements include estimation of the number of eigenvalues in the segment of interest , and evaluation of whether the dimension chosen for the subspaces is appropriate .",
    "this paper puts feast on a more solid foundation .",
    "finally , we outline at the end of this paper how feast can be extended to handle non - hermitian problems .",
    "throughout this paper , we consider two @xmath22 hermitian matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath24 is positive definite ; that is , @xmath25 for some invertible matrix @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the complex - conjugate transposition of @xmath26 .",
    "we state some well - known properties germane to our presentation .",
    "there exists an @xmath22 @xmath24-orthogonal matrix @xmath28 , @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a real diagonal matrix .",
    "each diagonal entry @xmath32 of @xmath31 together with its corresponding vector @xmath33 of @xmath28 constitute an eigenpair @xmath34 : @xmath35 .",
    "determining eigenpairs for the generalized problem given by @xmath36 is equivalent to determining eigenpairs for the single matrix @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 implies @xmath39 and @xmath40    this paper focuses on the following problem .",
    "given an interval @xmath41}$ ] on the real line , determine all @xmath42 ( counting multiplicities ) eigenpairs @xmath34 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the following is a simple variant of algorithms 5.3 and 7.5 in  @xcite .",
    "it is a subspace iteration algorithm with projection that also uses an accelerator @xmath45 .",

    "if we denote by @xmath59 the set of columns from @xmath28 corresponding to the eigenvectors of interest , then the choice @xmath60 , the spectral projector to the invariant subspace spanned by @xmath59 , is an ideal accelerator . algorithm a converges in one iteration if @xmath13 is chosen to be @xmath42 and @xmath61 happens to have full rank .",
    "the reason is that , under these assumptions , @xmath62 for some invertible @xmath63 .",
