    ", we propose a new four parameters distribution , referred to as the blfr distribution , which contains as special sub - models : the beta exponential ( be ) , beta rayleigh ( br ) , generalized linear failure rate ( glfr ) and linear failure rate ( lfr ) distributions , among others .",
    "the main reasons for introducing blfr distribution are : ( i ) the additional parameters introduced by the beta generalization is sought as a means to furnish a more flexible distribution .",
    "( ii ) some modeling phenomenon with non - monotone failure rates such as the bathtub - shaped and unimodal failure rates , which are common in reliability and biological studies , take a reasonable parametric fit with this distribution . (",
    "iii ) the blfr distribution is expected to have immediate application in reliability and survival studies .",
    "( iv ) blfr distribution shows better fitting , more flexible in shape and easier to perform and formula for modeling lifetime data .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we define the blfr distribution and outline some special cases of the distribution .",
    "we investigate some properties of the distribution in this section .",
    "some of these properties are the limit behavior and shapes of the pdf and hazard rate function of the blfr distribution .",

    "we discuss maximum likelihood estimation and calculate the elements of the observed information matrix .",
    "application of the blfr distribution is given in the section 5 .",
    "a simulation study is performed in section 6 .",
