    "gravitational waves ( gw ) , on very general grounds , appear to be a largely unavoidable consequence of a well established fact that no known interaction propagates instantly from source to observer : gravitation would be the first exception to this rule , should it be described by newton s theory . indeed ,",
    "the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath0 satisfies poisson s equation    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the density of matter in the sources of gravitational fields , and @xmath3 is newton s constant .",
    "but , since  ( [ eq1.1 ] ) contains no time derivatives , the time dependence of @xmath0 is purely _ parametric _ , i.e. , time variations in @xmath2",
    "_ instantly _ carry over to @xmath0 , irrespective of the value of @xmath4 .",
    "so , for example , non - spherically symmetric fluctuations in the mass distribution of the sun ( such as e.g. those caused by solar storms ) would instantly _ and _ simultaneously be felt both in the nearby mercury and in the remote pluto     quite independently of the _ quantitative _ relevance of such instant propagation effect in this particular example  which is none in practice  , its very existence is _ conceptually _ distressing .",
    "in addition , the asymmetry between the space and time variables in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) does not even comply with the basic requirements of special relativity .",
    "einstein s solution to the problem of gravity , general relativity ( gr ) , does indeed _ predict _ the existence of radiation of gravitational waves . as early as 1918 , einstein himself provided a full description of the polarisation and propagation properties of weak gws  @xcite . according to gr",
    ", gws travel across otherwise flat empty space at the speed of light , and have _ two _ independent and _ transverse _ polarisation amplitudes , often denoted @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively  @xcite . in a more general framework of so called _ metric theories _ of gravity , gws are allowed to have up to a maximum 6 amplitudes , some of them transverse and some longitudinal @xcite .",
    "the theoretically predicted existence of gws poses of course the experimental challenge to _ measure _ them .",
    "historically , it took a long while even to attempt the construction of a _ gravitational telescope _ : it was not until the decade of the 1960 s that j.  weber first took up the initiative , and developed the first gravitational antennas .",
    "these were elastic cylinders of aluminum , most sensitive to _ short bursts _",
    "( a few milliseconds ) of gws .",
    "after analysing the data generated by _ two _ independent instruments , and looking for events in coincidence in both , he reported evidence that a considerably large number of gw flares had been sighted  @xcite .",
    "even though weber never gave up his claims of _ real _ gw detection  @xcite , his contentions eventually proved untenable .",
    "for example , the rate and intensity of the reported events would imply the happening of several supernova explosions per week in our galaxy  @xcite , which is astrophysically very unlikely .",
    "it became clear that more sensitive detectors were necessary , whose design and development began shortly afterwards .",
    "in the mid 1970 s and early eighties , the new concept _ interferometric _ gw detector started to develop  @xcite , which would later lead to the larger _ ligo _ and _ virgo _ projects , as well as others of more reduced dimensions ( _ geo-600 _ and _ tama _ ) , and to the future _ space _ antenna _ lisa_. in parallel , _ cryogenic _ resonant detectors were designed and constructed in several laboratories , and towards mid 1990 s the next generation of _ ultracryogenic _ antennas , _ nautilus _ ( rome ) , _ auriga _ ( padua ) , _ allegro _ ( baton rouge , louisiana ) and _ niobe _ ( australia ) , began _ taking data_. more recently , data exchange protocols have been signed up for multiple detector coincidence analysis  @xcite . based on analogous physical principles , new generation _",
    "spherical _ gw detectors are being programmed in brazil , holland and    in spite of many years of endeavours and hard work , gws have proved elusive to all dedicated detectors constructed so far . however , the discovery of the binary pulsar _",
    "psr 1913 + 16 _ by r.  hulse and j.  taylor in 1974  @xcite , and the subsequent long term detailed monitoring of its orbital motion , brought a breeze of fresh air into gw science : the measured decay of the orbital period of the binary system due to _ gravitational bremsstrahlung _ accurately conforms to the predictions of general relativity .",
    "hulse and taylor were awarded the 1993 nobel prize in physics for their remarkable work . as of 1994  @xcite ,",
    "the accumulated binary pulsar data confirm gr to a high precision of a tenth of a percent .",
    "the binary pulsar certainly provides the most compelling evidence to date of the gw phenomenon as such , yet it does so thanks to the observation of a _ back action _",
    "effect on the source . even though i do not consider accurate the statement , at times made by various people , that this is only _ indirect _ evidence of gws , it is definitely a matter of fact that there is more to gws than revealed by the binary pulsar   for example , amplitude , phase and polarisation parameters of a gw can only be measured , according to current lore , with dedicated gw antennas .",
    "but how do gw telescopes interact with the radiation they are supposed to detect ?",
    "this is of course a fundamental question , and is also the subject of the present contribution , where i intend to review the",
    "_ theoretical foundations _ of this problem , and its solutions as presently understood . in section  [ sec.2 ] , i summarise the essential properties of gws within a rather large class of possible theories of the gravitational interaction ; section  [ sec.3 ] briefly bridges the way to sections  [ sec.4 ] and  [ sec.5 ] where interferometric and acoustic detector concepts are respectively analysed in some detail .",
    "section  [ sec.5 ] also includes aboundant reference to new generation spherical detectors in its various variants ( solid , hollow , dual ) .",
    "for the sake of completeness , i have added a section ( section  [ sec.6 ] ) with a very short summary of detector characterisation concepts , so that the interested reader gets a flavour of how sensitivities are defined , what do they express and how do gw signals compare with local noise disturbances in currently conceived detectors .",
    "section  [ sec.7 ] closes the paper with a few general remarks .",
    "quite generally , a time varying mass - energy distribution creates in its surroundings a time varying gravitational field ( _ curvature _ ) .",
    "as already stressed in section  [ sec.1 ] , we do not expect such time variations to travel instantly to distant places , but rather that they travel as _ gravity waves _ across the intervening space .",
    "now , how are these waves `` seen '' ? a _",
    "observer may of course not feel any variations in the gravitational field where he / she is immersed , if he / she is in _ free fall _ in that field  this is a consequence of the _ equivalence principle _",
    "_ two _ nearby observers have instead the capacity to do so : for , both being in free fall , they can take each other as a reference to measure any relative _ accelerations _ caused by a non - uniform gravitational field , in particular those caused by a _ gravitational wave field_. we can rephrase this argument saying that gravitational waves show up as _ local tides _ , or gradients of the local gravitational field at the observatory .    in the language of differential geometry",
    ", tides are identified as _ geodesic deviations _ ,",
    "i.e. , variations in the four - vector connecting nearby geodesic lines .",
    "it is shown in textbooks , e.g.  @xcite , that the geodesic deviation equation is    @xmath7    where `` @xmath8 '' means _",
    "covariant derivative _ , @xmath9 is proper time for _ either _ geodesic , @xmath10 is the riemann tensor , @xmath11 is a unit tangent vector ( again to either geodesic ) , and  @xmath12 is the vector connecting corresponding points of the two geodesic lines .",
    "the gw fields considered in this paper will be restricted to a class of _ perturbations _ of the geometry of otherwise flat space - time , with the additional assumptions that they be    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     this is certainly not the most general definition of a gw yet it will suffice to our purposes here : any gws generated in astrophysical sources and reaching a man - made detector definitely satisfy the above requirements .",
    "the interested reader is referred to  @xcite for a thorough treatment of more general gws .    following the above assumptions , a gw can be described by perturbations @xmath13 of a",
    "lorentzian metric @xmath14 , i.e. , there exist _ quasi - lorentzian _ coordinates @xmath15 in which the space - time metric @xmath16 can be written    @xmath17    with    @xmath18    the actual effect of a gw on a pair of test particles is , according to  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , determined by the riemann tensor @xmath10 , and this in turn is determined by the functions @xmath19 .",
    "i now review briefly the different possibilities in terms of which is the theory underlying the physics of gravity waves , i.e. , which are the field equations which the @xmath19 satisfy .",
    "the vacuum field equations of general relativity are , as is well known  @xcite ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the ricci tensor of the metric @xmath22 .",
    "if quadratic and successively higher order terms in the perturbations @xmath19 are neglected then this tensor can be seen to be given by    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    new coordinates @xmath25 can be defined by means of transformation equations    @xmath26    and these will still be quasi - lorentzian if the functions @xmath27 are _ sufficiently small_. more precisely , the gw components are , in the new coordinates ,    @xmath28    provided higher order terms in @xmath29 are neglected .",
    "thus `` sufficiently small '' means that the derivatives of @xmath30 be of the order of magnitude of the metric perturbations @xmath31  so that in the new coordinates @xmath32 the metric tensor _ also _ splits up as @xmath33 .",
    "it is now possible , see  @xcite , to choose new coordinates in such a way that the _ gauge conditions _    @xmath34    hold .",
    "this being the case , equations  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) read    @xmath35    which are vacuum _ wave equations_. therefore gws travel across empty space at the speed of light , according to gr theory . _ plane wave solutions _ to ( [ eq2.9 ] ) satisfying ( [ eq2.8 ] ) can now be constructed  @xcite which take the form    @xmath36    for waves travelling down the @xmath37-axis .",
    "the label @xmath38 is an acronym for _ transverse - traceless _ , the usual denomination for this particular gauge .",
    "the physical meaning of the polarisation amplitudes in ( [ eq2.10 ] ) is clarified by looking at the effect of an incoming wave on test particles .",
    "consider e.g.  two equal test masses whose center of mass is at the origin of @xmath38 coordinates ; let @xmath39 be their distance in the absence of gws , and @xmath40 the orientation ( relative to the @xmath38 axes ) of the vector joining both masses . making use of the geodesic deviation equation  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , with the riemann tensor associated to  ( [ eq2.10 ] ) , it can be seen that the gw only affects the _ transverse _ projection of the distance relative to the wave propagation direction ( the @xmath37-axis ) ; in fact , if @xmath41 is such distance then some simple algebra leads to the result .",
    "but it can also be calculated at the position of _ either _ one of them    this would only make up for a negligible _ second order _ difference . ]",
    "@xmath42\\;.   \\label{eq2.12}\\ ] ]    '' and `` @xmath43 '' polarisation modes of a gw , according to gr theory . the dotted lines ( circles ) indicate the test particles position in the absence of gw signal .",
    "each step in the graph corresponds to a quarter of the period of the driving gw , as labeled atop .",
    "[ fig1],width=449 ]    it is very important at this point to stress that the _ wavelength _ @xmath44 of the incoming gw must be much larger than the distance @xmath45 between the particles for  ( [ eq2.12 ] ) to hold , i.e. ,    @xmath46    and this is a condition which must be _ added _ to the already made assumption that @xmath47 .",
    "a graphical representation of the result ( [ eq2.12 ] ) is displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] : a number of test particles are evenly distributed around a circle perpendicular to the incoming gw , i.e. , in the @xmath48 plane .",
    "when a periodic signal comes in , the distances between those particles change following  ( [ eq2.12 ] ) ; note that the changes are modulated by the angular factors , i.e. , according to the particles positions on the circle .",
    "the `` @xmath49 '' mode is characterised by a vanishing wave amplitude @xmath50 , while in the `` @xmath43 '' mode @xmath51 vanishes .",
    "although general relativity has never been questioned so far by experiment , there are in fact alternative theories , e.g.  brans - dicke theory  @xcite , which are interesting for a number of reasons , for example _ cosmological _ reasons  @xcite .",
    "generally , these theories make their own specific predictions about gws , and they partly differ from those of gr  just discussed .",
    "the term _ metric theory _ indicates that the gravitational interaction affects the _ geometry _ of space - time , i.e. , the metric tensor @xmath22 is a fundamental ingredient  though other fields may also be necessary to complete the theoretical scheme .",
    "obviously , general relativity falls within this class of theories .",
    "the appropriate scheme to assess the physics of such more general class of gws was provided long ago  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider only _ plane gravitational waves _ , which should be an extremely good approximation for astrophysics , given our great distance even to the nearest conceivable gw source , and to characterise them by their _ newman - penrose scalars",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "it appears that only _",
    "six _ components of the riemann tensor out of the usual  20 are independent in a _ plane _",
    "gw ; these are given by the four newman - penrose scalars    @xmath52    of which @xmath53 and @xmath54 are real , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are _ complex _ functions of the null variable @xmath57 ",
    "see  @xcite for all notation details .",
    "if a quasi - lorentzian coordinate system is chosen such that gws travel along the @xmath37-axis then @xmath58 , and one can calculate the scalars  ( [ eq2.14 ] ) to obtain    _ 2(t - z ) & = & -r_tztz , [ eq2.15a ] + _ 3(t - z ) & = & -(-r_txtz+r_tytz ) , [ eq2.15b ] + _ 4(t - z ) & = & -r_txtx+r_tyty+2r_txty , [ eq2.15c ] + _ 22(t - z ) & = & -r_txtx - r_tyty .",
    "[ eq2.15d ]    general relativity is characterised by @xmath59 being the only non - vanishing scalar , while in brans - dicke theory @xmath60 also is different from zero  see  @xcite for full details .",
    "it is relevant to remark at this stage that the only non - trivial components of the riemann tensor of a plane gw are the so called `` _ _ electric _ _ '' components , @xmath61 , as we see in equations  ( [ eq2.15a]d ) above .",
    "these are , incidentally , _ also _ the only ones which appear in the geodesic deviation equation  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , since one may naturally choose @xmath62 .",
    "but , because of the symmetries of the riemann tensor , only values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 different from zero , i.e. , @xmath65 , give non - zero contributions . ]",
    "has spherical symmetry , so it includes a combination of longitudinal and transverse excitations in like proportions .",
    "[ fig2],width=415 ]    this fact helps us make a graphical representation of all _ six _ possible polarisation states of a general metric gw in the same manner as in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the result is represented in figure  [ fig2 ]  whose source is reference  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to take a ring of test particles , let a gw pass by , and analyse the results of the displacements it causes in the distributions of those particles , just as done in section  [ sub2.2 ] .",
    "note that the first three modes are _ transverse _ , while the other three are longitudinal  see the caption to the figure .",
    "as already stressed , gr only gives rise to the two @xmath56 modes .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the objectives and procedures to detect gws : knowing their physical structure , one can design systems whose interaction with the gws be sufficiently well understood and under control ; suitable monitoring of the dynamics of such systems will be the source of information on whatever gw parameters may show up in a given observation experiment .",
    "there are _ two _ major detection concepts : _ interferometric _ and _ acoustic _ detection .",
    "historically , the latter came first through the pioneering work of j.  weber , but interferometric gw antennas are at present attracting the larger stake of the investment in this research field , both in hardware and in human commitment .",
    "this is because much hope has been deposited in their capabilities to reach sufficient sensitivity to _ measure _ gws for the first time .",
    "interferometric detectors aim to measure phase shifts between light rays shone along two different ( straight ) lines , whose ends are defined by _ freely suspended _ test masses .",
    "this is done in a michelson layout , using mirrors , beam splitters and photodiodes .",
    "acoustic detectors are instead based on elastically linked test masses  rather than freely suspended  which _ resonantly _ respond to gw excitations .",
    "these _ qualitative _ ideas can be made quantitatively precise , but the process is a non - trivial one and has important subtleties which must be properly understood for a thorough assessment of the detector workings and readout .",
    "the next sections are devoted to explain with some detail which are the _ theoretical principles _ governing the behaviour and response of both kinds of gw antennas .",
    "a rather _ nave _ idea to measure the effect of an incoming gw is provided by the following argument  see also figure  [ fig3 ] for reference : let a gw having a `` @xmath49 '' polarisation ( assume gr for simplicity at this stage ) come in perpendicular to the local horizontal at a given observatory ; if three masses are laid down on the vertices of an ideally oriented isosceles right triangle then , as we saw ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , the catets shrink and stretch with opposite phases . if a beam of laser light is now shone into the system , and a beam - splitter attached to mass @xmath66 and mirrors attached to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then one can think of measuring the distance changes between the masses by simple interferometry .    '' polarised relative to the @xmath69 and @xmath70 axes , causes the end masses @xmath67 and @xmath68 to oscillate in phase opposition relative to the central mass @xmath66 .",
    "light is shone into the system , and suitable beam splitters and mirrors are attached to the masses ; length changes are then measured interferometrically , which directly lead to determine the gw amplitude .",
    "[ fig3],width=415 ]    this may look like a very reasonable proposal for a detector yet the following criticism readily suggests itself : gravitation is concerned with _ geometry _",
    ", i.e. , gravitational fields alter lengths and angles ; therefore gws will affect _ identically _ both distances between the masses of figure  [ fig3 ] _ and _ the wavelength of the light travelling between them  thus leading to a _ cancellation _ of the conjectured interferometric effect ",
    "while the criticism is certainly correct , the conclusion is _",
    "not_. the reason is that it overlooks the fact that gravitation is concerned with the geometry of _ space - time _",
    " not just space . in the case of the above",
    "gw it so happens that , in @xmath38 coordinates , the time dimension of space - time is not _ warped _ in the gw geometry  see the form of the metric tensor in equation  ( [ eq2.10 ] )  while the transverse space dimensions _ are_. consequently an electromagnetic wave travelling in the @xmath48 plane experiences _ wavelength _ changes depending on the propagation direction , but it does _ not _ experience _ frequency _ changes .",
    "the net result of this is that the _ phase _ of the electromagnetic wave differs from direction to direction of the @xmath48 plane , and _ this _ makes a gw amenable to detection by interferometric principles",
    ".    looked at in this way , the masses represented in figure  [ fig3 ] only play a _ passive _ role in the detector , in the sense that they simply make the interference between the two light beams possible by providing physical support for the mirrors and beam splitters . in other words , the physical principles underlying the working of an interferometric gw detector must have to do with the _ interaction between gws and electromagnetic waves _ rather than with geodesic deviations of the _",
    "masses_.    admittedly , this is not the most common point of view  @xcite .",
    "it can however be made precise by the following considerations , which are studied in depth in references  @xcite and  @xcite .      according to the above",
    ", it appears that we must address the question of how gw - induced fluctuations in the geometry of a background space - time affect the properties ( amplitude and phase ) of a plane electromagnetic wave  a _ light beam _   which travels through such space - time",
    ". it will be sufficient to consider that the light beam is a _ test _",
    "beam , i.e. , its back action on the surrounding geometry is negligible .",
    "let then @xmath71 be the vector potential which describes an electromagnetic wave travelling in vacuum ; @xmath72 thus satisfies maxwell s equations    @xmath73    where @xmath74 stands for the generalised dalembert operator :    @xmath75",
    "we need only retain _ first order _ terms in @xmath31 in the covariant derivatives , so that equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) reads    @xmath76    to this equation , _ gauge conditions _ must be added .",
    "we shall conventionally adopt the usual lorentz conditions , @xmath77 , which , to lowest order in the gravitational perturbations , read    @xmath78    in addition to the weakness of the gw perturbation , it is also the case in actual practice that :    * the gw typical frequencies , @xmath79 , are much smaller than the frequency of the light , @xmath80 : @xmath81 . * the wavelength of the gw is much larger than the cross sectional dimensions of the light beam .",
    "wave front distortions and beam curvature are effects which can also be safely neglected in first order calculations  @xcite .",
    "finally , i shall make the simplifying assumption of perpendicular incidence , i.e. , the incoming gw propagates in a direction orthogonal to the interferometer s arms .",
    "we shall thus consider one of the interferometer arms aligned with the @xmath69-direction , and the other with the @xmath70-direction , while the incoming gw will be assumed to approach the detector down the @xmath82 .",
    "the interaction gw - light beam will thus occur in the @xmath83 plane , hence the gw perturbations can be suitably described by a function of time alone , i.e. ,    @xmath84    where @xmath79 is the frequency of the gw , which we can also safely assume to be plane - fronted , since its source will in all cases of interest be far removed from the observatory .",
    "in addition , for a beam running along the @xmath85 , the electromagnetic vector potential will only depend on the space variable @xmath69 and on time ,  i.e. ,    @xmath86    the following _ ansatz _ suggests itself for a solution to equations  ( [ eq3.3 ] ) :    a_t(t , x ) & = & _ 0(t ) , [ eq3.7a ] + a_x(t , x ) & = & _ 1(t ) , [ eq3.7b ] + a_y(t , x ) & = & a_2 e^i_2(t ) , [ eq3.7c ] + a_z(t , x ) & = & a_3 e^i_3(t ) , [ eq3.7d ]    where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are small quantities of order @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are constants , and @xmath80 is the frequency of the light . clearly , these expressions reproduce the plane wave solutions to vacuum maxwell s equations in the limit of flat space - time , i.e. , when @xmath94 .",
    "let us now take an incoming gw of the form    @xmath95    and substitute it into ( [ eq3.3 ] ) and ( [ eq3.4 ] ) , with the _ ansatz _  ( [ eq3.7a]-d ) , neglecting higher order terms in the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "then  @xcite , _ both _ @xmath97 and @xmath98 are seen to satisfy the approximate differential equation    @xmath99    the solution to this equation which is _ independent of the initial conditions _ is , to the stated level of accuracy ,    @xmath100    as shown in reference  @xcite , we need not worry about either @xmath87 or @xmath88 at this stage because the _ longitudinal _ component of the electric field ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) is an order of approximation smaller than the transverse components , which are given by    @xmath102    hence    e_y(x , t ) & & a_2 , [ eq3.12a ] + e_z(x , t ) & & a_3 .",
    "[ eq3.12b ]    these expressions beautifully show how the incoming gw causes a _ phase shift _ in an electromagnetic beam of light .",
    "note that this phase shift is a _ periodic _ function of time , with the frequency of the gw . if we consider a real interferometer , such as very schematically shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , and call @xmath103 the _ round trip _ time for the light to go from @xmath66 to @xmath68 and back , then the accumulated phase shift is , according to these formulas ,    @xmath104    since there is an obvious symmetry between light rays travelling to the right and to the left for a gw arriving perpendicularly to them .",
    "the arguments leading to equations ( [ eq3.12a]-b ) can be very easily reproduced , _ mutatis mutandi _ , to obtain the phase shift experienced by a light ray travelling in the @xmath105 , rather than the @xmath69 direction  everything in fact amounts to a simple interchange @xmath106 in the equations , which includes @xmath107 as this is equivalent to @xmath108 , see  ( [ eq2.10 ] ) .",
    "the result is    @xmath109    in the actual interferometer , provided it has equal arm lengths , the two laser rays recombine in the beam splitter with a net phase difference    @xmath110    and this produces an _ interference signal _ , which is in principle measurable  if the instrumentation is sufficiently sensitive .",
    "the reader may wonder how is it that the detector signal only depends on one of the gw amplitudes , @xmath51 , but not on the other , @xmath50 .",
    "the reason is that we have made a very special assumption regarding the orientation of the gw s polarisation axes relative to the light beam propagation directions . in a realistic case ,",
    "even if perpendicular gw incidence happens , the detector s arms will not be aligned with the gw s natural axes , let alone the most likely case of _ oblique _ incidence .",
    "an important conclusion one should draw from this section is a _ conceptual _",
    "one , that interferometric detectors are able to measure gw amplitudes and polarisations as a result of the interaction between the electromagnetic field of light rays and the background space - time geometry they travel across .    beyond this ,",
    "though , equation  ( [ eq3.15 ] ) has very relevant _ quantitative _ consequences , too .",
    "for example , as stressed in reference  @xcite , its range of validity is _ not _ limited to interferometer arms short compared to the gw wavelength .",
    "therefore , according to the formula , a _",
    "null _ effect ( signal cancellation ) happens if the round trip time @xmath111 equals the period of the gw , @xmath112 .",
    "likewise , equation  ( [ eq3.15 ] ) also tells us that _ maximum _ detector signal occurs when @xmath113 .",
    "all this happen to be true for arbitrary incidence and polarisation of the incoming gws as well . for gw frequencies in the 1khz range",
    ", the best detector should thus have arm lengths in the range of 150  kilometers   and even longer for lower gw frequencies .",
    "no ground based gw antenna has ever been conceived of such dimensions yet there are intelligent ways to _ store _ the light in shorter arms for suitably tuned gw periods .",
    "i shall not go into details of these technical matters , see  @xcite and  @xcite for thorough information .     at its ends to oscillate at the gw s frequency .",
    "resonant amplification is obtained when the latter equals the spring s characteristic frequency , @xmath80 .",
    "[ fig4],width=264 ]",
    "acoustic gw detectors work based on a completely different concept  see figure  [ fig4 ] : the idea is to set up test masses @xmath114 linked together by a spring of relaxed length @xmath39 , so that gw _ tides _ drive their oscillations around the equilibrium position , with significant mechanical amplification at the spring s characteristic frequency @xmath80 .",
    "the spring deformation    @xmath115    thus obeys the following equation of motion :    @xmath116    where    @xmath117\\,\\sin^2\\theta\\ ; ,   \\label{eq5.3}\\ ] ]    as follows from ( [ eq2.12 ] )  see also reference  @xcite for a complete discussion of this case .",
    "this is the main idea , but in practice acoustic gw detectors are _ elastic solids _ rather than a single spring , i.e. , they do not have a single characteristic frequency but a whole spectrum .",
    "the response of an elastic solid to a gw excitation is assessed by means of the classical theory of elasticity , as described for example in  @xcite .",

    "first thing to study the response of an elastic solid to an incoming gw is , as we have just seen , to determine its characteristic oscillation _ modes _ , i.e. , its frequency spectrum @xmath132 and associated wavefunctions , @xmath133 . in the case of a cylinder",
    "this is a formidable task ; although its formal solution is known  @xcite , cylindrical antennas happen in practice tobe narrow and long  @xcite , and so approximate solutions can be used instead which are much simpler to handle , and sufficiently good  see also  @xcite .",

    ". if an incoming gw flux density of @xmath138 watts per square metre and hertz sweeps the cylinder and sets it to oscillate with energy @xmath139 joules then the cross section is _ defined _ by the  ratio    @xmath140    which is thus measured in m@xmath141hz .",

    "the weakness of the coupling gives an indication of how difficult it is to detect gws . by the same token ,",

    "this is a severe penalty , and it also happens in interferometric detectors not optimally oriented  @xcite .      the first initiatives to construct and operate gw detectors are due to j.  weber , who decided to use elastic cylinders .",
    "this philosophy and practice has survived him , and still today ( february 2002 ) all gw detectors in continuous data taking regimes are actually weber bars , though with significant sensitivity improvements  @xcite derived , amongst other , from ultracryogenic and _ squid _ techniques .",

    "i ll come to this in detail shortly ",
    ", thus proving that a full - fledged spherical gw detector is within reach of current technological state of the art , as developed for weber bars .",
    "it was apparently the fears to find unsurmountable difficulties in this problem which deterred further research on spherical gw antennas for years  @xcite .",
    "in this section i will give the main principles and results of the _ theory _ of the spherical gw detector , based on a formalism which has already been partly used in section  [ sec.5 ] , and for whose complete detail the reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , first thing we need is the _ eigenmodes _ and _ frequency spectrum _ of the spherical solid .",
    "this is a classical problem , long known in the literature , the solution to which i will briefly review here , with some added emphasis on the issues of our present concern .",
    "the oscillation eigenmodes of a solid elastic body fall into two families : _ spheroidal _ and _ torsional _ modes  @xcite . of these , only the former couple to gws , while torsional modes do not couple at all  @xcite .",
    "spheroidal wavefunctions have the analytic form    @xmath149    where @xmath150 are spherical harmonics  @xcite , @xmath151 is the outward pointing normal , @xmath152 is the ` angular momentum operator ' , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are somewhat complicated combinations of spherical bessel functions  @xcite , and @xmath156 are ` quantum numbers ' which label the modes .",
    "the frequency spectrum appears to be composed of ascending series of _ multipole harmonics _",
    ", @xmath157 , i.e. , for _ each _ multipole value  @xmath158 there are an infinite number of frequency harmonics , ordered by increasing values of @xmath159 . for example , there are _ monopole _ frequency harmonics @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , etc . ; then _ dipole _ frequencies @xmath163 , @xmath164 ,  , then _ quadrupole _",

    "each of these frequencies is @xmath167-fold degenerate , and this is a fundamental fact which makes of the sphere a theoretically ideal gw detector , as we shall shortly see .",
    "if the above expressions are substituted into ( [ eq5.8a]-b ) , then into  ( [ eq5.7 ] ) , one easily obtains the sphere s response function as    @xmath168   & + & \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\,\\frac{a_{n2}}{\\omega_{n2}}\\,\\left[\\sum_{m=-2}^2   \\vec{u}_{n2m}(\\vec{x})\\,g_{n2}^{(2,m)}(t)\\right]\\ ; ,   \\label{eq5.15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    a_n0 & = & -_0^r a_n0(r)r^3r , [ eq5.16a ] + a_n2 & = & -_0^r r^3r , [ eq5.16b ]    and    @xmath169    ) are actually _ complex _ ( the spherical harmonics for @xmath170 are complex ) suitable combinations of them and their complex conjugates have been used to make plotting possible .",

    "[ fig6],width=7 ]    the series expansion ( [ eq5.15 ] ) transparently shows that _ only _ monopole and quadrupole spherical modes can possibly be excited by an incoming gw .",

    ", thus making detection less efficient .",
    "we shall assess quantitatively the efficiency of the spherical detector in terms of _ cross section _",

    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the shapes of all these modes  @xcite   see the caption to the figure for further details .",
    "_ degeneracy _ is a key concept for the _ multimode _ capabilities of the spherical detector . for , as explicitly shown by equation  ( [ eq5.15 ] ) , monopole and quadrupole _ detector _",

    "i shall give a more detailed review of how the multimode capability can be implemented in  practice .",
    "the general definition ( [ eq5.11 ] ) applies in this case , too . since",
    "cross section is a _ frequency _ dependent concept , and since quadrupole modes are degenerate , it is clear that energies deposited in _ each _ of the five degenerate modes of a given frequency harmonic must be added up to obtain @xmath180 for that mode .",
    "such energy must be calculated by means of volume integrals   to add up the energies of all differentials of mass throughout the solid   , the details of which i omit here .",

    "they are shown in table  [ tab1 ] , where a material of aluminum al5056 alloy has been chosen .",
    "it appears that a sphere having the same fundamental frequency ( @xmath198 ) as a cylinder ( @xmath199 ) is about 20 times more massive , and this results in a significant improvement in cross section , since it is proportional to the detector mass .",
    "a spherical detector is therefore almost _ one order of magnitude _ more sensitive than a cylinder in the same frequency band   obviously apart from the important fact that the sphere has _ isotropic _ sensitivity .    .",
    "note the ( slightly ) better figure ( 17% ) for the lowest mode in the sphere , as well as the appreciable value in the second harmonic of the latter , in sharp contrast with the _ null _ coupling of this mode in the cylinder .",

    "table  [ tab1 ] also refers to the sphere s cross section in its _ second _ higher quadrupole harmonic frequency , @xmath200   almost twice the value of the first , @xmath198 .",
    "it is very interesting that cross section at this second frequency is _ only _ 2.61 times smaller than that at the first  @xcite while , as stressed in section  [ sub2.1 ] , it is _ zero _ for the second mode of the cylinder .",

    "mass _ of a cylinder and a sphere of like fundamental frequencies .",
    "it graphically displays the numbers given in the table , but also shows that , even per unit mass , the sphere is a better detector than a cylinder ",
    "its cross section ` curve ' stays above the cylinder s .",
    "in particular , the _ first _ quadrupole resonance turns out to have a cross section which is 1.17 times that of the cylinder ( per unit mass , let me stress again )  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath20117% better .",

    "system must be set up . in the case of currently operating cylinders",
    "this is done by what is technically known as _ resonant transducer _",
    "the idea of such device is to couple the _",
    "large _ oscillating cylinder mass ( a few tons ) to a _ small _ resonator ( less than 1 kg ) whose characteristic frequency is accurately tuned to that of the cylinder .",
    "joint _ dynamics of the resulting system @xmath202cylinder + resonator@xmath203 is a two - mode _ beat _ of nearby frequencies given by    @xmath204    where @xmath205 is the frequency of either oscillator when uncoupled to the other , and @xmath206 .",
    "the key concept of this device is the _ resonant energy transfer _ , which flows back and forth between cylinder and sensor with the period of the beat , i.e. , @xmath207 .",
    "this means that , because the sensor s mass is very small compared to that of the cylinder , the amplitude of its oscillations is enhanced by a factor of @xmath208 relative to those of the cylinder , whence a _ mechanical amplification _",
    "factor is obtained _ before _ the sensor oscillations are converted to electrical signals , and further processed   see a more detailed account of these principles in  @xcite .",
    "the same principles can certainly be applied to make resonant motion sensors in a spherical antenna . in this case , however , a special bonus is there , associated to the _ degeneracy _ of the quadrupole frequencies : because all five quadrupole modes oscillate with the _ same _ frequency , it is possible to attach five ( or more ) identical resonators , tuned to a given quadrupole frequency , at suitable positions on the sphere surface , thus taking _ multiple samples _ of the sphere s motion .",

    "see _ lisa _ s web site at http://sci.esa.int/home/lisa and figure  [ fig.12 ] below .",
    "what we see in ordinates in plots like the one in figure  [ fig.11 ] , which are standard in gw science , is a _ spectral density _   or , rather , its _",
    "square root_. it is to be understood as follows .",
    "_ noise _ of whatever origin causes any detector to generate random outputs   _ stochastic _ time series , as this is technically known .",
    "this noise competes with any gw signals which may be present in the antenna readout , obscuring their detection .",
    "noise of course does not come from the sky , it rather gets added to the gw signal at almost all the different stages of the detection process .",
    "for example , the gw induced oscillations of a given mass compete with thermal oscillations of that mass and its suspension systems ; then there is noise in the conversion from mechanical or optical gw signals to electrical signals ; then there is noise introduced by the electronics in the amplifiers of the latter ; and so forth     in the end , the detector output is a certain physical magnitude ( e.g.   a voltage ) which consists of a number of various superimposed sources of noise plus , possibly , a gw signal _ converted _ to volts by the detector hardware .",
    "one infers the value of the _ actual _ dimensionless gw amplitude @xmath238 , say , from the output voltage if one knows the precise physics of the transduction process   and",
    "this is obviously the case in any useful instrument .",
    "conversely , it is also possible to _ back - convert _ all the sources of noise voltage picked up across the various detector stages to an equivalent dimensionless `` gw noise '' , which gets directly added to real gw signals , and travels through an ideally noiseless detector .",
    "this artifact is expedient because , for a fixed antenna , it enables a quick assessment of the detectability of a given gw signal , normally calculated by methods of gravitation theory , by direct comparison with suitably constructed detector characteristic curves  such as those in figure  [ fig.11 ] .",
    "let us then call @xmath239 any one of the detector s readout channels , _ back - converted _ to a gw amplitude by the above described procedure .",
    "we split this up into a gw signal proper @xmath238 plus a noise term @xmath240 :    @xmath241    for stationary gaussian noise , the statistical properties of @xmath240 are encoded in its _ spectral density _ function , @xmath242 , which is the fourier transform of the _ autocorrelation function _    @xmath243    where @xmath244 stands for _ ensemble average _",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the _ optimum filter _ to extract the signal @xmath238 from the system readout @xmath239 is the so called _ matched filter _ , whose transfer function is the signal s fourier transform @xmath245 divided by the spectral density @xmath242 , and the _ detection threshold _ can be set from the integrated signal to noise ratio :    @xmath246    the gw signal @xmath238 is a dimensionless quantity , as it measures a perturbation of the minkowski metric , see equation  ( [ eq2.2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the spectral density @xmath242 has dimensions of time , or inverse frequency , hz@xmath247 , according to the definitions  ( [ eq5.28 ] ) .",
    "now , signal to noise ratio as defined by the integral  ( [ eq5.29 ] ) is made up of the contributions of the ratio between the signal power @xmath248 to the noise power @xmath242 at all frequencies ; the idea of the graphical representation in figure  [ fig.11 ] is thus to show which is the level of noise at different frequencies by means of an rms quantity , such as is the square root of the noise spectral density .",
    "the appropriate units for this representation are accordingly hz@xmath249 , as indicated .",
    ", width=12 ]    different interesting sources of gws are being considered by other authors in this volume , so i will not go into such matters here .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to present an example graph of a few signals on top of various detectors sensitivity curves in order to get a picture of the actual possibilities of each instrument , and also to grasp what are the spectral orders of magnitude of different gw signals .",
    "one such plot is presented in figure  [ fig.12 ] .",
    "this is , let me insist , the standard way to assess the detectability of the different gw sources .",
    "this article is a brief review on the nature of the interactions of gws with _ test _",
    "particles and _ test _ electromagnetic fields , as they specifically happen in currently conceived detection devices . while the fundamental principles are not new in themselves , their application in actual systems is still in many cases subject of research , as we have seen .",
    "a thorough understanding of these matters is absolutely essential for an adequate interpretation of the antenna readouts , the more so if one considers the extreme _ weakness _ of any signals reaching us from even the most intense sources .",
    "i have omitted any detailed discussion of the practical problems faced by real detector building .",
    "this is a major research field in itself , of an intrinsically sophisticated and multidisciplinary nature  involving such fundamental issues as quantum measurement limits and techniques , or quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "but it is of course not directly related to astrophysics or relativity ",
    "i have however considered appropriate to summarily brief the interested reader on how detector sensitivities are defined , and on which are the detection thresholds in current state of the art gw detectors : this is a key issue for an astrophysicist / relativist wishing to assess the detectability of a given gw signal , whether by existing instruments or future planned .",
    "gw detection endeavours have been the subject of intensive research during the last 4 decades , though the ultimate goal of sighting gw events has still not been accomplished . while this may look like a major failure , one may not forget that detector sensitivities have gone up by a remarkable _ six orders of magnitude _ ( in energy , three in gw amplitude ) since the very first telescopes constructed by j.  weber .",
    "also , a look at the trend in this development indicates that we are getting closer to the obejctive .",
