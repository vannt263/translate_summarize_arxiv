    "@xcite demonstrated that clumpy structures form due to gas instability , which could also explain some clumpy galaxies observed in the high - redshift universe .",
    "these galaxies are referred to as clump clusters ( chain galaxies ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that these clumpy stellar structures fall into the galactic centre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the galactic centre , a clump - origin bulge .",
    "clump - origin bulges form through ` _ _ mergers of the clumps _ _ ' in a galactic disc , neither the galactic merger nor the secular evolution .",
    "therefore , properties of clump - origin bulges could be different from those of the conventional ones , classical bulges nor pseudobulges .",
    "i perform a similar numerical simulation to @xcite using an isolated halo model by a @xmath0-body / sph code and study the naive natures of clump - origin bulges in details .",
    "our initial condition follows the spherical model that was used to study the formation of disc galaxies in an isolated environment .",
    "i assume an equilibrium system with the nfw profile with a virial mass @xmath1 .",
    "baryon mass fraction of the system is set to @xmath2 .",
    "the details of my simulation settings are given in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , i plot the azimathally averaged surface density and density map from the edge - on view .",
    "the fitting is given by the srsic index , @xmath3 indicating a nearly exponential density profile .",
    "as seen from the central panel , it clearly appears that this bulge is a boxy bulge from the edge - on view .",
    "furthermore , i find that this bulge shows a significant rotation with a value of @xmath4 , the rotation ( spin ) is _ not _ negligible in kinematics .",
    "these are indicating pseudobulge signatures @xcite .",
    "however , i find that the clump - origin bulge consists of stars with an over - solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "additionally , this bulge formation scenario , the clump cluster phase , is expected to happen only at the high - redshift . therefore , the clump - origin bulge consists of old stars .",
    "such old and metal - rich natures are better similar to classical bulges rather than pseudobugles @xcite .",
    "the mw bulge is also known to be an ambiguous bulge .",
    "the mw bulge shows a nearly exponential profile , an oblate peanut shape ( x - shape ) and a significant rotation , which are similar to pseudobulges . at the same time , the mw bulge is made of old and metal - rich stars , which are classical bulge signatures @xcite .",
    "these properties of the mw bulge are consistent with the clump - origin bulge obtained in this study .",
    "such unclassifiable bulges ( old pseudobulge ) are also observed in some other disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "my simulation results imply that such old pseudobulges like the mw bulge may be a clump - origin bulge and the mw might use to be a clump cluster ."
