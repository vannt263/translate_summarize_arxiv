    "the applicability of the black ",
    "scholes framework for the pricing and hedging of derivative claims crucially depends on the assumption of market completeness , i.e. , the possibility to replicate claims and thus eliminate risk . this assumption is not fulfilled if the asset process is driven by more than one source of risk or when market imperfections such as transaction costs are not negligible .",
    "one then speaks of an incomplete market in which investors may attribute different prices to derivatives , according to their risk preferences .    as an example , let us consider a jump diffusion process , i.e. , the asset @xmath0 evolves according to @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a wiener and @xmath3 a poisson process with frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the random variable @xmath5 determines the relative size @xmath6 of the jump .",
    "the oldest and probably most popular approach for the pricing and hedging of a claim on such an asset is merton s @xcite .",
    "there , the investor sets up a portfolio @xmath7 consisting of the claim with value @xmath8 and a quantity @xmath9 of assets , so that the evolution of the portfolio is given by @xmath10 it is in general not possible to eliminate jump and diffusion risk at the same time , so some `` optimal '' choice is necessary .",
    "merton s proposal is to hedge only the diffusion risk and to diversify the jump risk , i.e. , to set @xmath11 .",
    "the above then yields @xmath12 if jump risk is diversified , the investor does not need any risk premium for taking this risk , i.e. , the expected value of @xmath13 should vanish .",
    "thus , we obtain the partial integro - differential equation ( pide ) @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the cumulative jump frequency distribution , i.e. , for an interval @xmath16 with characteristic function @xmath17 , @xmath18 gives the frequency of jumps of size in @xmath16 .",
    "in particular @xmath19 .",
    "two remarks are in order here :    1 .",
    "the diversification of jump risk is problematic not only in our model ( as there is only one asset ) , but also in practice : in a typical market crash , jumps occur in the whole market , so diversification may well turn out to be accumulation of risk .",
    "2 .   merton s proposal coincides with a naive interpretation of the black ",
    "scholes framework which states that for risk - neutral pricing one simply has to adjust the drift term such that the expected drift vanishes ( in discounted units ) , and that the appropriate hedging strategy is given by the derivative of the price .",
    "in particular , the real - world drift does not enter the price , which is a benefit , as it is notoriously hard to estimate .",
    "note that the assumption that diversification is possible is crucial here , since otherwise one could not invoke no - arbitrage arguments to set the expected return of the portfolio to zero .",
    "if one drops this assumption , then the investor should ( i ) try to find an optimal balance between diffusion and jump risk and ( ii ) value the remaining risk in order to obtain a risk premium .",
    "a popular framework that achieves ( i ) is minimal variance pricing and hedging , cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "there , the investor tries to minimize the variance of the expected returns .",
    "it has the advantage that no new concepts have to be introduced .",
    "however , the choice of a quadratic criterion is somewhat arbitrary and penalizes profits as well as losses .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a jump diffusion , the framework in general yields a _ signed _ risk - neutral measure , i.e. , there would be positive claims which have a negative value in the framework .",
    "finally , the framework only tackles ( i ) , but does not yield a price for the remaining risk .",
    "a framework that achieves ( i ) and ( ii ) at one stroke is utility based pricing and hedging .",
    "there , the investor is equipped with a concave von neumann utility function @xmath20 that assigns an economic value to the wealth @xmath21 at the investment horizon @xmath22 .",
    "risk aversion is encoded in the concavity of @xmath23 which entails that the investor prefers a secure income to a random income with the same expectation .",
    "this preference is encoded in the risk aversion @xmath24 .    in this framework , the appropriate price @xmath25 for a claim with payoff @xmath26 is the indifference price , i.e. , the amount the investor should receive such that her maximal expected utility @xmath27 $ ] for initial capital @xmath28 is the same as the expected utility @xmath29 $ ] for initial capital @xmath30 .",
    "this means that one has to consider investment and hedging at the same time and then try to disentangle them . in general , this is a very complicated optimization problem .",
    "however , in the limit where the number of traded claims is infinitesimally small , the problem becomes much simpler .",
    "one then speaks of the _ marginal indifference price _ and the corresponding _ marginal optimal hedge_. this field has ripen considerably during the last years .",
    "milestones were the papers of kramkov and srbu , who gave sufficient criteria for the the marginal indifference price to be well - behaved @xcite , and defined the concept of the marginal optimal hedge , together with convenient characterizations of it @xcite .",
    "the framework was applied to , e.g. , basis risk @xcite , transaction costs @xcite , and lvy processes and stochastic volatility models @xcite .    in spite of its conceptual elegance",
    ", the practical applicability of the framework seems to be limited by two problems :    1 .   the marginal indifference price and the marginal optimal hedge depend strongly on the real - world drift , which is notoriously hard to estimate .",
    "2 .   the marginal indifference price ( and also the marginal optimal hedge ) are essentially independent of the risk aversion of the investor @xcite .",
    "the second fact is quite inconvenient for a framework whose purpose is to incorporate risk aversion .",
    "it turns out that the two problems can be solved , at one stroke , by a change of perspective .",
    "the marginal indifference price takes into account how well the option trade matches to the optimal investment strategy of the investor .",
    "the assumption is of course that the investor is invested in this optimal strategy .",
    "however , the investment strategy a bank chooses is typically not derived from the model that is used to price options .",
    "it is thus tempting to interpret the _ actual _ investment strategy as the optimal one and adjust the drift such that they match .",
    "one may thus speak of an _ implied drift_. to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this concept is new .    in the following section , we introduce utility based pricing and hedging in a heuristic fashion . in particular , we do not ( explicitly ) use semi - martingale decompositions , on which the rigorous mathematical treatment @xcite heavily relies . instead , we use the concept of functional differentiation and derive a formula for the marginal optimal hedge that is similar to the well - known @xmath31 hedging formula .",
    "it has a straightforward economic interpretation and is , to the best of our knowledge , new .",
    "we suspect that , when made mathematically precise , this approach is equivalent to setting of kramkov and srbu in the common domain of applicability . at least for the case of a jump diffusion under power utility , this is shown to be true , as we re - derive results implicitly contained @xcite . for the case of exponential utility",
    "we obtain results that are , to the best of our knowledge , new . even though the approach presented here",
    "is not ( yet ) mathematically rigorous , and , if made so , presumably equivalent to that of kramkov and srbu , it might still be interesting , as it sheds new light on the framework and is also straightforwardly applicable in a discrete time setting , which might be useful in practical applications .    in section  [ sec : interpretation ] , we discuss our results , in particular the two problems mentioned above .",
    "the concept of implied drift that solves these is also introduced . as a nontrivial toy model that exemplifies the discussion",
    ", we use a jump diffusion with fixed jump size .",
    "we also compare the marginal utility price and hedge with those obtained in merton s and the minimal variance approach .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook .",
    "the basic idea of marginal utility based pricing and hedging is the following : consider an investor with a concave utility function @xmath23 , i.e. , the expected utility for investment with time horizon @xmath22 is given by @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the wealth process depending on some trading strategy @xmath34 .",
    "this is maximized by the optimal investment strategy @xmath35 : @xmath36 throughout this paper , we will consider trading strategies given by a space of functions @xmath37 of time , wealth , and the asset price , that is equipped with some locally convex topology .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the set of admissible trading strategies is an open subset , and that it contains a unique optimal investment strategy @xmath35 .",
    "this allows us to consider infinitesimal perturbations of @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 should be such that the maximal expected utility is finite and such that the asset process is a local martingale under the measure @xmath38 defined by @xmath39},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the real - world measure . for conditions under which the last requirements are fulfilled",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "if we now want to value a european claim with maturity @xmath22 and bounded payoff @xmath26 , where @xmath41 is the asset process , we force the investor to short an infinitesimal number @xmath42 of them . for this",
    "she may charge a price @xmath43 per claim .",
    "it is the indifference price if @xmath44.\\ ] ] it means that the investor is willing to sell the options at a price @xmath45 , as this does not decrease her expected utility .",
    "the limit @xmath46 is the _ marginal indifference price_. the marginal optimal hedge can be similarly characterized as the linear change of @xmath35 that is needed to achieve the maximum on the r.h.s .  of .",
    "before we formalize this notion , we discuss the wealth process @xmath47 and the optimal investment strategy @xmath35 for the case of a jump diffusion and introduce functional differentiation , a technical tool we later employ .",
    "the wealth process @xmath33 corresponding to the asset process , given a trading strategy @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 here @xmath50 denotes the wealth invested in the asset at time @xmath51 , given that the total wealth is @xmath30 and the asset price is @xmath52 .",
    "note that no interest rate is present , so we are working in discounted units .    for a quantity @xmath53 , depending on time @xmath51 , the wealth @xmath30 and the asset price @xmath52 that fulfills @xmath54 \\quad \\forall t \\leq \\tau,\\ ] ] one obtains the partial integro - differential equation ( pide ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the integro - differential operator defined by @xmath57 note that in we included the dependence on the trading strategy @xmath34 . as @xmath34 is a function ( of @xmath51 , @xmath30 and @xmath52 ) , @xmath58 is , apart from being a function of @xmath51 , @xmath30 and @xmath52 , also a _ functional _ , i.e. , a map from a space of functions to the real numbers",
    ". a useful tool for discussing extrema of such functionals are functional derivatives , which we briefly discuss in section  [ sec : functionalderivatives ] .    in the absence of consumption ,",
    "the expected utility @xmath59 fulfills ( [ eq : piconsistency ] ) . for the maximal expected utility @xmath60 , the hjb equation @xmath61 = 0\\ ] ] holds , where the supremum is achieved by the optimal investment strategy @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the optimal investment strategy @xmath62 fulfills @xmath63 using the explicit form ( [ eq : lpi ] ) of @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath64 where we used the notation @xmath65 for the wealth after a jump . having solved for @xmath35 , we know that @xmath66 fulfills the pide @xmath67 for investment with a time horizon @xmath22 , the boundary condition is given by the utility @xmath23 at time @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "we now discuss the form of @xmath35 and @xmath66 in the two cases that will be of most interest to us , namely the case of constant relative or absolute risk aversion .",
    "constant relative risk aversion is specified by a utility function @xmath69 the limit @xmath70 corresponds to logarithmic utility , and the results below are also valid in that case .",
    "it can be shown that , up to an unimportant multiplicative constant , the expected utility @xmath66 is of the same form , i.e. , @xmath71 introducing the notation @xmath72 , becomes @xmath73 we see that @xmath74 is independent of @xmath30 and @xmath51 .",
    "the optimal strategy is to invest a fixed fraction of the wealth in the asset . for precise conditions under which a solution to exists",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "we now discuss a special case which we will study explicitly in section  [ sec : interpretation ] and in which can be solved analytically :    if only jumps of a certain size @xmath75 can happen , i.e. , @xmath76 , then becomes @xmath77 here we introduce the notation @xmath78 for the relative jump size . for logarithmic utility ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath79 this has an analytic solution : @xmath80 this has the expected behavior : @xmath81 always has the same sign as the average drift @xmath82 .",
    "also note that the expression under the square root is strictly positive , so that an optimal investment strategy always exist for a fixed jump size . for @xmath83 , can easily be solved numerically .",
    "we briefly consider the case of constant absolute risk aversion , i.e. , exponential utility @xmath84 as above , the expected utility is of the same form , where @xmath85 ( but not @xmath86 ) is time dependent .",
    "the optimal investment strategy @xmath87 fulfills @xmath88 a solution @xmath87 of this equation will be independent of @xmath30 and @xmath51 , so that the optimal strategy is to invest a fixed amount of wealth in the asset .",
    "furthermore , it is antiproportional to the risk aversion @xmath86 , i.e. , we can write @xmath89 for some constant @xmath90 . noting that , for large @xmath91 , @xmath92 behaves as @xmath93 , one obtains , by inspection of and that @xmath94    finally , we remark that by applying the pide to the terminal condition @xmath95 , one can show that for @xmath35 fulfilling , one has @xmath96",
    ", i.e. , @xmath97.\\ ] ]      we briefly introduce the concept of functional derivatives as a special case of directional derivatives , cf .",

    "many of the usual theorems of differential calculus hold , in particular the fundamental theorem .",

    "@xmath112 is bilinear and symmetric .",
    "this generalizes to derivatives of arbitrary order .",
    "there is a taylor formula from which it follows that a sufficient condition for a @xmath109 function to have a local maximum in @xmath100 is that @xmath113 and @xmath114 for all @xmath101 .",

    "the functionals that we want to differentiate below are solutions to a pide of the form , which we want to differentiate w.r.t .",

    "is a uniformly integrable martingale .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this is the case for power utility if the jump distribution has a finite second moment , a condition that we had to impose , too , cf .",
    "the discussion at the end of section  [ sec : functionalderivatives ] .",
    "then one can use the minimal variance hedging formula with this measure .",
    "one indeed obtains .",
    "we will now discuss the results obtained so far . in order to exemplify the findings",
    ", we use the toy model of a jump diffusion with a fixed jump size @xmath75 .",
    "this model is analytically tractable @xcite .",
    "re - introducing the risk - free rate @xmath221 , we have to solve a pide of the form @xmath222 where we used @xmath223 .",
    "the only difference between the different methods and utilities lies in the value of @xmath224 that is employed .",
    "the above is solved by @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the black  scholes price for the claim , given a risk - free rate @xmath221 and a dividend yield @xmath204 .      in order to get a feeling for the magnitude of the effect , we compare the marginal indifference price for logarithmic utility with merton s and the minimal variance price .",
    "we use a process with @xmath227 , @xmath228 , i.e. , on average there is a jump of @xmath229 every four years . for the marginal indifference price , the relevant value for @xmath224 is obtained from and . the price for a put ( converted to implied volatilities )",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : price_posret ] . as a reference",
    ", the square root of the annualized variance is indicated .",
    "we see that the marginal indifference price and the minimal variance price are quite close together , but the difference to merton s price is notable . for a moneyness of 0.5 , it corresponds to a price difference of 40% .    that the marginal indifference price and the minimal variance price are above merton s price is not a generic feature , but depends on the average drift of the asset .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : price_negret ] , which shows the same plot as before , but with an expected drift @xmath230 .",
    "now the marginal indifference price and the minimal variance price are below merton s price .",
    "this can be understood as follows : if the expected drift is positive , the investor will be invested in the asset .",
    "since jumps are always downwards in our model , she is exposed to jump risk . writing a put on the asset in this situation",
    "enlarges this exposure .",
    "she will thus ask for a risk premium . on the other hand ,",
    "if the expected drift is negative , the investor is short the asset and is then exposed to the risk of no jumps happening . writing a put in this situation diminishes the exposure to this risk .",
    "thus , she can sell the put with a discount . this strong dependence on",
    "the drift seems to limit the practical applicability of the framework , as it is very hard to estimate .",
    "another disturbing feature of the marginal indifference price is that it is essentially independent of the risk aversion . that it is completely independent of the risk aversion @xmath86 in the case of exponential utility is obvious from .",
    "but also for power utility , it is independent of @xmath91 in the limit @xmath231 . using and comparing and",
    ", one easily sees that the marginal indifference price for power utility converges to the one for exponential utility in the limit @xmath231 .",
    "this property was proven in a general setting in @xcite . in our example , this is shown in figure  [ fig : beta1 ] : the price changes very little with the risk aversion and approaches the price for exponential utility in the limit @xmath231 .",
    "the two features just discussed , the drift dependence and the essential risk aversion independence of the marginal indifference price seem to limit the practical applicability of the framework .",
    "we also note that the essence of the indifference price is that it takes into account how well the option trade matches to the optimal investment strategy .",
    "but typically the investment strategy a bank chooses is not derived from the model that is used to price options .",
    "a possible way out is a change of perspective : one takes the actual investment strategy as given and tries to take it into account for the valuation and hedging of options .",
    "this is possible straightforwardly , as , , and do not contain the original drift directly , but only via @xmath81 or @xmath90 . in the case of power utility",
    "one would thus set @xmath81 to the fraction of the wealth that is actually invested in the asset and use and . in the case of exponential utility ,",
    "one uses the actual amount invested in the asset and the risk aversion @xmath86 to compute @xmath90 via . it is easily seen that this amounts to a change of the drift in the original problem .",
    "one may thus speak of an implied drift .",
    "note however , that this implied drift need not be computed for pricing and hedging .",
    "it suffices to know the actual investment strategy .",
    "this change of perspective solves the problems discussed above : one does not need to know the drift , and the price and hedge will in general depend on the risk preference .",
    "this is exemplified in figure  [ fig : beta2 ] .",
    "we see that the marginal indifference price increases considerably with the risk aversion .",
    "we note however , that also the opposite effect is possible : for a negative actual , i.e. , optimal , investment strategy , the marginal indifference price decreases with risk aversion . again , this is due to the fact that by selling a put the investor can hedge the risk of no jumps happening , to which she is exposed by her investment strategy .",
    "nevertheless , the marginal indifference price is always greater than the black  scholes price , in which the jump component is neglected .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath232 , one recovers merton s price .",
    "this , however , is not true for the marginal optimal hedge , which coincides with the minimal variance hedge for @xmath233 in that case .",
    "we now discuss the hedges corresponding to the prices considered before .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta_posret ] shows the hedges for the prices shown in figure  [ fig : price_posret ] . while the minimal variance and the marginal optimal hedge are relatively close together , the deviation from merton s hedge is noticeable .",
    "heavily out of the money ( @xmath234 ) , the relative difference is over 150% .",
    "note that this strong deviation stems mainly from the new hedging formula and not so much from using a different price .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ fig : delta_posret_2 ] where , for the same parameters as above , merton s hedge and the optimal marginal hedge are compared to the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath52 of the marginal indifference price .",
    "this derivative is quite close to merton s hedge , so for hedging purposes it seems to be more important to use the appropriate hedging formula than to use the correct price .",
    "finally , we compare the marginal optimal hedges corresponding to the prices shown in figure  [ fig : beta2 ] .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig : beta3 ] .",
    "we see the expected behavior , i.e. , for out of the money puts the higher the risk aversion the shorter the investors are in the asset in order to hedge against downward jumps .",
    "we discussed marginal utility based pricing and hedging for the case of a jump diffusion process .",
    "we pointed out two problems that seem to limit the practical applicability of the framework : the drift dependence and the essential risk aversion independence of the marginal indifference price and the corresponding hedge .",
    "we proposed to circumvent these by a change of perspective , by interpreting the actual investment strategy as the optimal one .",
    "we also compared the marginal utility based framework conceptually and concretely in a toy model with the minimal variance and merton s framework .    it would be desirable to apply the framework to more realistic models like a log - normal jump distribution or variance - gamma processes .",
    "while this is no problem in principle , we note that by the inclusion of a risk preference , the jump distribution is changed .",
    "thus , computational methods that rely on a particular form of the jump distribution may no longer be applicable .",
