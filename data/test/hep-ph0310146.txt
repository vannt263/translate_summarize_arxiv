    "it has been believed some time ago that gauge symmetries with anomalies cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism  @xcite in @xmath1 dimensions could be spontaneously broken in such a way that , after compactifying to four dimensions , a global symmetry inherited from the gauge symmetry could , in principle , survive , @xmath2 ,  @xcite .",
    "the survival of a global gauge symmetry  even after the gauge bosons have acquired a higgs field induced mass  is quite mysterious because the vacuum is not gauge invariant under the gauge symmetry with constant gauge function ( @xmath3 ) due to the kalb - ramond field ( which plays a major role in this phenomenon ) . despite this",
    ", it seemed as though there remains a phase transformation symmetry for the fields carrying the family - dependent @xmath4-charge when gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken in this remarkable way .",
    "we emphasise in this article that , precisely this phase transformation symmetry is _ not _ a true symmetry if one takes into account the world sheet instantons .",
    "we shall argue below that if the compactifying space is of order of the fundamental scale , then the local and global gauge symmetry gets totally broken .",
    "however , it is unrealistic to compactify the space so close to the fundamental scale .",
    "the crucial point is that the effect of the world sheet instantons will be exponentially suppressed . in the case of very strong breaking ( of the order of the fundamental scale )",
    "it would mean that we could not apply the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath5 , for the application to the large hierarchical yukawa coupling constant structures .    on the other hand",
    ", if we let the compactifying scale be much below the fundamental scale , there is another odd feature : there is very light ( abelian ) gauge particle from the fundamental scale point of view and correspondingly we get that the condition @xmath6 for not having anomalies is fulfilled identically .",
    "this would lead to a rather strange electrodynamics .",
    "if the validity of the usual @xmath7 is not maintained , the dynamics could open the possibility for space - time foam causing the break down of the global charge conservation due to wormholes .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in the next section , we review the green - schwarz anomaly mechanism , and in section @xmath8 the world sheet instantons , and we also discuss the string coupling constant .",
    "section @xmath9 contains the various discussions including the suspected effects of wormholes .",
    "finally , section @xmath10 contains our conclusions .",
    "let us review the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism focusing on the kalb - ramond field in @xmath1 dimensions and then the application for the @xmath0 dimensions .    for the purpose of making phenomenological fits of the quark and ( charged ) lepton masses and mixing angles",
    "it is very useful to have some approximately conserved charges  @xcite ( in addition to the gauge charges of the standard model ) so that most of the masses get suppressed due to the differences in quantum numbers of the right- and left - handed weyl components .",
    "it is very attractive , and needed due to the effects of wormholes  @xmath11  @xcite , to let such mass suppressing charges be gauge charges .",
    "there are many gauge charges in superstring theory so such a picture is not unnatural in this theory . working in @xmath0 dimensions one would at some level expect to obtain a @xmath0 dimensional field theory with gauge fields which could be described as renormalisable .",
    "that in turn would imply that the triangle anomalies resulting from the various chiral fermions in the effective @xmath0 dimensional model should cancel , @xmath5 , no violation of gauge symmetry would be caused .",
    "otherwise this effective model would not be renormalisable .",
    "now , however , it became very popular to use the inspiration from the superstring theory to suggest models in which this `` usual '' gauge anomaly cancellation does _ not _ take place .",
    "from the four dimensional point of view this avoidance , which is usually needed for renormalisation , gauge- and mixed anomaly cancellation conditions seems quite extraordinary : a certain coefficient field @xmath12 in an expansion for the kalb - ramond field @xmath13 in the @xmath1 dimensional theory , couples as an axion field .",
    "that is to say it couples via the lagrangian density term of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 .    in the superstring theories ( type ii and heterotic strings )",

    "one may typically make use of calabi - yau spaces as the @xmath22-dimensional compactifying space . for pedagogical reasons , just to illustrate the idea we may in the present article think of a compactifying space being the cross product of three spheres , each of topology @xmath23 and each with a magnetic field on them corresponding to a `` magnetic monopole in the centre of the @xmath23 sphere '' .",
    "let us imagine that the equations of motions have led to that the vacuum has @xmath23 rotation invariant fields on the different @xmath23 s .",
    "then we may symbolically use these rotational invariant rotation symmetry is , we have in mind , that the topological @xmath23 is represented by a sphere which then has the symmetry under @xmath24 rotations ( about a point outside the sphere ) with respect to the fields assumed to be present . ]",

    "suppose we arranged one of spherical harmonic or eigenfunction to be dominant in the weakly exited state .",
    "we describe the effective four dimensional theory by means of the expansion coefficient @xmath12 to this term : @xmath31 really we could define such @xmath12 by integrating the two form @xmath32 over a homotopically non - trivial @xmath33-cycle .",
    "this would then require that we imposed other terms in the expansion of @xmath34 to be restricted to zero .",
    "taking the magnetic fields in the compactifying dimensions as constants we end up with an effective term in the four dimensional lagrangian density which up to the over all constant is of the form ( [ eq : axionlag ] ) .",
    "from the kinetic term for the kalb - ramond field , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath37 the dilaton field , @xmath38 the yang - mills gauge coupling constant in the lagrangian density , we obtain a kinetic term for the coefficient field @xmath12 . due to the @xmath18 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgs ] ) it comes together with an abelian part of the yang - mills potential in an expression of the form @xmath39 this is a gauge invariant combination for the @xmath40-field gauge transform @xmath41 while @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gauge function for an invariant @xmath44 subgroup of the left over symmetry group , not spontaneously broken .    for simplicity",
    "we imagine that the presence of the extra dimension fields @xmath25 @xmath45 represents a break down to a subgroup which still contains at least one invariant abelian subgroup called @xmath4 .",
    "then we may concentrate on the gauge field associated with this subgroup @xmath4 and denote the gauge function for it as @xmath43 .",
    "we shall discuss a rather extraordinary behaviour of the theory  from the four dimensional point of view  with the axion field @xmath12 ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : foureffec ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 does not quantum fluctuate so widely that it totally looses an expectation value .",
    "this means that there is a spontaneous break down of the gauge symmetry for @xmath4 .",
    "since even the constant @xmath43 gauge transformation is spontaneously broken due to the additive transformation property of @xmath40 , the spontaneous breaking situation is just like that of the higgs case .",
    "however , that means , one would expect that particles  such as fermions carrying @xmath4-charge quanta  would be able to make transitions into ( sets of ) particles with a different number of such charges ( together ) . at this point , however , one has often found the belief that the global symmetry and the noether conservation of the charged particles is _ not _ violated . in the perturbative approximation",
    "this belief is well - granded .",
    "we will discuss this question in the following in non - perturbative approximation .",
    "although at first it seems as if there is no way to cause the global @xmath4-charges on particles to be created or annihilated , it was shown in  @xcite that such a violation of the charge was indeed occurring due to world sheet instantons .",
    "these `` world sheet instantons '' refer to the tunnelling of a string so as to have a `` time track '' during tunnelling which encloses in our simple scenario the @xmath23 involved with the @xmath34 . in the real general case",
    "we should have the tunnelling go around a @xmath33-cycle homotopical to the @xmath33-cycle(s ) used for extracting @xmath40 from @xmath32 .",
    "the important point for the present discussion is as follows : when such a world sheet instanton exists , there are zero modes for the fermions ( as well as bosons ) which have @xmath4-charge .",
    "these zero modes cause the @xmath4-charge to change . in this anomalous way",
    " similar to the qcd - instanton  the global charge gets also violated after all . according to  @xcite",
    "this is much more natural than not having the global @xmath4-charges broken .    in reality",
    "the effect of this zero - mode effect is described by an effective lagrangian term @xmath46 here the @xmath47 are various @xmath4-charged fields and the product @xmath48 could , for instance , be @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a field for which @xmath4 has the role of a chiral mass protecting charge .",
    "the whole term is to be multiplied by the amplitude of the world sheet instanton .",
    "the factor @xmath51 comes from the exponentiated string action eq .",
    "( [ eq : insttunn ] ) , which may cause the damping and the factors @xmath52 are needed to make the whole term gauge invariant .    in supersymmetric theories , where these models are usually considered ,",
    "such an axion field must occur together with a corresponding field in a complex combination .",
    "for instance the anomalous fayet - iliopoulos d - term was studied  @xcite in the context of the heterotic string theory : they consider a dilaton chiral supermultiplet , @xmath53 , adding to the khler potential a part , @xmath54 , which transforms under the @xmath4 gauge group as @xmath55 the khler potential is with appropriate vector kinetic term @xmath56 the gauge coupling constant thus depends on the dilaton , @xmath57 .",
    "the theory also has an axion coupling proportional to @xmath58 . with the shift transformation of the axion field under @xmath4 gauge group ( see eq.([eq : u(1)xtra ] ) ) , this term serves to remove the anomaly proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "the d - term potential is using eq .",
    "( [ eq : stringyk ] ) @xmath60 we should emphasise that in the weak coupling limit , where dilaton field goes to zero ( @xmath61 ) the fayet - iliopoulos d - term vanishes , @xmath5 , there is a supersymmetric minimum .",
    "if we contrary to the just given argumentation assumed that after all non - zero fayet - iliopoulos d - term were stabilised ",
    "@xmath5 , there were at least the metastable minimum for non - zero @xmath62  then for the weakly - coupled heterotic string according to ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath63 , there is a fayet - iliopoulos d - term given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the planck mass and @xmath66 is the sum of @xmath4-charges .    thus the potential energy becomes @xmath67 so that @xmath68 is obviously negligible at very small dilaton field even if one wishes to have a model in which @xmath66 is non - zero , a typical value of @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( see @xmath2  @xcite ) .",
    "according to  @xcite the d - term  ( [ eq : anomalousfi ] ) may induce some ( non - zero ) expectation value of a scalar field called @xmath71 , and thus cause a spontaneous breakdown of the global ( part ) of the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "supposing no other scaler field break this group , then the non - zero vacuum expectation value of @xmath71 may be made a connection with the fayet - iliopoulos d - term in following way : @xmath72 where the @xmath4-charge of the higgs field @xmath71 , @xmath73 , is taken to be @xmath74 . in this way",
    "one could obtain an expansion parameter for the fermion mass matrices from @xmath75 : in the case of @xmath75 being not too large ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomalousfi ] ) ) , in other words , @xmath76 is not too small and the sum of @xmath4-charges ( @xmath66 ) is of order @xmath77 to @xmath70 , we could use such a mechanism to produce a good order of magnitude for the breaking of the global charge conservation for @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 symmetry would be broken one or two orders of magnitude below the fundamental scale ( planck or string scale , depending on model ) .",
    "this situation could be using the fundamental scale as the planck scale , @xmath78 @xmath5 , an expansion parameter for the fermion mass matrices which is identified with the cabibbo angle .",
    "if we have identified the string coupling constant , @xmath76 , with a dynamical field ",
    "the dilaton field @xmath79  the ground state will be found by adjusting this coupling @xmath76 to be zero , which obviously means the disappearance of the global charge breaking effect .",
    "in this situation , which is the expected one , we have thus at first no complain from world sheet instantons about the possibility hoped for in literature of having the global charge totally conserved although derived from a higgs gauge symmetry .",
    "however , if the string coupling constant @xmath76 is really going to zero , then the models in which this happens have zero string coupling constant , and they become _ totally free _ , since in string theory all interactions are finally derived from the string interaction @xmath76 . unless one can somehow live with a tiny breaking of supersymmetry at very high energy scale allowing a small but non - zero @xmath76",
    ", the models avoiding a fayet - iliopoulos d - term would become totally free as string theories !    the wish that the adjustment lets the fayet - iliopoulos d - term vanish by adjusting the @xmath79 to be zero is further supported by the often favored phenomenological call for supersymmetry not to be broken except at low energy scales , typically close to 1 tev , because it can be of help for the hierarchy problem . from the point of view of the high scale of energy , where we have the higgsing of the @xmath4 group , a phenomenologically useful supersymmetry breaking scale would be tremendously small and essentially count as zero .",
    "this argument further disfavours models which would have troubles due to the fayet - iliopoulos d - term .",
    "but if the problem is solved by adjusting to the supersymmetry which is only extremely weakly broken by having the string coupling almost zero , then the type of model is even more problematic , because it lacks the interaction altogether .",
    "as a resume of the above discussion let us compare the two logical possibilities concerning the size of the string coupling constant @xmath76 of being of order unity @xmath80 or sufficiently small ( @xmath81 ) both being considered in the presence of a non - trivial green - schwarz anomaly cancellation so that the fayet - iliopoulos d - term becomes non - zero unless @xmath82 :    1 .",

    "@xmath76 is large : in this case the world sheet instantons and the fayet - iliopoulos d - term may be too large so that the breaking , which they cause , would also be too large ( @xmath5 the expansion parameter @xmath83 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath4-charge can not be used to the small hierarchy problem of the fermion masses .",
    "@xmath76 is not too large : in this case @xmath76 could give a good expansion parameter @xmath83 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) and see sec .",
    "[ sec : order ] )",
    ". then one could hope for the desired breaking of global charge _ without _ invoking further breaking mechanisms .",
    "+ in the case when @xmath76 is really small the global charge is very well conserved , but one can imagine it broken by other means so that it would be no problem",
    "higgsing 12 .",
    "the higgsing of the local part of the gauge group uses the kalb - ramond field and that works independent of the size of @xmath76 ( unless of course the whole theory becomes free that one can conclude that nothing happens at all ) .",
    "anomaly cancellation for @xmath4 from four dimensional point of view 1 .   a strong @xmath76 : in this case the world sheet instanton breaking would be strong and there would essentially be not even a global charge approximately conserved .",
    "2 .   a bit weaker @xmath76 : there is an approximately conserved global charge which does not have the cancellation by triangle diagrams which is required for a gauge charge .",
    "the four dimensional model is derived from an although non - renormalisable  as all theories in ten dimensions  then at least gauge invariant theory .",
    "it is therefore surprising that it does not satisfy the usual conditions on numbers of fermion species and their charges needed for the anomaly cancellation .",
    "it is the reason why there is the wess - zumino term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgs ] ) .",
    "however , how does that remove the need for anomaly cancellations ?",
    "one might wonder how the situation of the anomaly cancellation would be , if we had that the mass scale @xmath86 of the @xmath4-photon ( eq .  ( [ eq : ymkin ] ) ) were very low compared to the scale of energy at which we consider the situation . from the point of view of such a high energy scale compared to @xmath86 , it would seem that the kinetic term for the axion field , @xmath40 , were very close to having zero coefficient , @xmath5 , an auxiliary field .",
    "the effect of integrating out @xmath40 functionally would be to produce a functional @xmath87-function with the effect of imposing the constraint @xmath88 with such a constraint imposed on the gauge field it would of course be no wonder if one gets no anomalies .",
    "in fact it would mean that the anomaly @xmath89 had been constraint to be zero .",
    "such a constraint will lead to interactions between photons which are of course in the next approximation in @xmath90 understandable as due to exchange of the @xmath40-particles , @xmath5 , @xmath91 .",
    "however , notice that diagrams , like fig .",
    "[ fig : photonb ] , have the @xmath40 field propagator which has the contribution of a factor @xmath92 .",
    "this propagator contribution is tremendous compared to @xmath93 since @xmath94 is in the range ( orders of magnitude ) above the @xmath4-photon mass scale , @xmath86 , @xmath5 , @xmath95-scatterings have extremely strong interactions .",
    "therefore , they may be able to provide the constraint forces which uphold the constraint eq .",

    "however , if we have a non - zero dilaton field , we also have world sheet instanton effects breaking the global charge conservation using green - schwarz anomaly cancellations .",
    "thus , this suggests to use this instanton effect in stead of a fayet - iliopoulos d - term .",
    "could this effect be adjusted for a phenomenologically reasonable global charge breaking of order of the cabbibo angle @xmath83 ?    baring a totally mysterious cancellation of various contributions from different world sheet instantons the order of magnitude of the @xmath4 breaking by world sheet instantons is estimated as the exponent of the supersymmetry associated term to the field @xmath40 , which makes up a complex field .",
    "the possibility of surprising cancellations would have to be ignored  @xcite if it were not for the findings that this indeed easily can occur  @xcite .",

    "the    charge conservation is strongly broken : let us then imagine that the    mass or the effective yukawa coupling for a quark or a charged lepton    is obtained via a chain diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fndag ] ) in which a series    of fundamental scale vector coupled fermion propagators are linked by    higgs fields or world sheet instanton caused transition symbols .",
    "if    the strength of the charge violating world sheet instantons is of just    the same order of magnitude as the ( typical ) fundamental scale fermion    masses , then there will be no suppression , and the    @xmath4-charge considered will be of no help in    explaining the suppression of some effective yukawa couplings ( at    experimental scales ) compared to others .",
    "however , taking    `` everything '' especially the compactifying space dimensions to be    very close to unity in `` fundamental '' units , such that even exponents    are accurately of order unity is presumably not likely to be true . _ ( 2 ) _ : :    the other possibility is that there are some quantities which can not    be considered order unity in the very strong way discussed under point    _ ( 1)_. the compactifying dimensions turn out to be the quantities of    importance for the strength of the @xmath4-charge    violation .",
    "let it be clear that there are really two scales of    breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry to be discussed :    +    _ ( a ) _ ; ;      there is the @xmath4-photon mass scale ,      @xmath5 , the mass @xmath86 of eq .",

    "[ fig : energylev ] ) .",
    "this would mean @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath5 , @xmath140 , a very useful suppression factor indeed .",
    "this is namely a typical order of magnitude for an @xmath83 with which one fits the fermion mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "energylev    ( 60,30 )    [ fig : energylev ]    in this way it looks very promising to get very naturally a good scale for violation strength for phenomenological fitting .",
    "we can say that , strictly speaking , a scale @xmath117 of the compactifying dimensions just @xmath141 times bigger than the fundamental length scale @xmath142 is so close to being of order unity , that there is hardly any call for any special explanation for this `` deviation '' from it being the fundamental size . that we can notice some small numbers in both the fine structure constants and in the suppressed violation of the @xmath4-charge is due to respectively the @xmath22 dimensional compactifying space and the exponentiation because of the world sheet instanton effect needed .",
    "the energy scale gap in which we have the funny electrodynamics with the constraint @xmath143 is in the just sketched scenario ( with @xmath144 ) reduced to a scale factor in the @xmath141 region .",
    "that is such a very small range that one would hardly be able to claim that anything strange will happen .",
    "independent of whether world sheet instantons do or do not break global charge , there is another mechanism threatening the global charge conservation : the effect of wormholes",
    ".    we shall in fact show below in subsec .",
    "[ sec : wormholeii ] that our estimation of the effects of gravitational wormholes present in the vacuum ( or similar space - time foam effects ) _ will give rise to a significant violation of the global charge  in the four dimensional theory  with the non - trivial green - schwarz anomaly cancellation , although it has resulted from a gauge charge _ and",
    "thus at first might have been suspected of not being violated by space - time foam effects .    over most of the energy scale ( logarithmical counted ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : energylev ] ) between the fundamental scale and the @xmath4 violation scale @xmath108 , we have a globally conserved charge for @xmath4 while the gauge particle `` already '' had its mass at @xmath145 .",
    "now , however ( see subsec .",
    "[ sec : wormholeii ] ) , according to arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite charges which are not gauge protected may disappear into wormholes or baby universes .",
    "therefore , one may speculate whether such a charge conservation which is unprotected by gauge fields will not get its conservation spoiled by the wheeler space - time foam .",
    "actually such effects of breaking the global charge are expected at energy scales smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "but we will see in subsec .",
    "[ sec : wormholeii ] that wormholes at even higher energy scales than @xmath86 shall provide such breaking when the monopoles are used .",
    "the wormholes of low energy ( smaller than @xmath86 ) , @xmath5 , of large ( length ) are suppressed exponentially with some exponent related to @xmath146 .",
    "in fact we would ( naively ) estimate that for a space - time foam ingredient such as a baby universe of size @xmath147 ( in length ) we would have an action of order @xmath148 , and a suppression factor of @xmath149 .",
    "it happens under the assumption @xmath150 to be just the same order of magnitude  in the exponent suppression factor  as the one present in the world sheet instanton suppression factor .",
    "for this coincidence to occur it was quite crucial that the estimate just used for the baby universe action was of the form @xmath151 ( @xmath152 is baby universe tube ) as being obtained by use of einstein - hilbert action and not @xmath153 which would have been the case if the cosmological term in the action were significant here .",
    "that is to say , we used that the cosmological constant is zero , but at these scales one is closer to the ( running ) cosmological constant which is relevant for short distance and which may have another value than the long distance one which is practically zero . in any case",
    "even if the cosmological constant were relevant , it would suppress the baby universes at the scale @xmath86 even more .",
    "the space - time foam non - conservation is expected to be at most what the world sheet instanton effect would have been if the @xmath76 were of order unity , contrary to true expectation .",
    "now , however , since we truly do not expect the world sheet instantons to provide breaking then the wormhole effects could easily take over as the dominant effect .",
    "rather we should say that we do expect an appreciable wormhole breaking ( see the argument below ) .",
    "it could be that the world sheet breaking effect could actually dominate even in the case of @xmath154 , but the result would in this case not be so different with respect to the order of magnitude of the ( exponent of the ) effect , and thus the conclusion would be the same . however , in the case that there is no significant world sheet instanton effect , the wormholes can very well work and completely and dominantly break the charge conservation .      in this subsection",
    "we will prove for that the @xmath4-charge is violated as a global charge due to the wormhole effects .    in the foregoing subsection we saw",
    "that one could give immediate arguments both in favour of and against the global @xmath4-charge being violated by the wormhole or space - time foam effects .",
    "in this subsection we want to deliver an argument which shows that indeed _ the global @xmath4-charge",
    "is broken due to the wormholes_. we should , however , stress that this breaking is exponentially suppressed but _ only with the suppression corresponding to the scale of the higgsing @xmath86 _ , which is essentially the compactification scale . in the realistic models",
    "this is a rather high energy scale and the breaking from wormholes is thus expected to be quite large . compared to what one gets from world sheet instantons , which do not work after all in the case of @xmath76 being of order one , this could be much bigger than the latter .",
    "it is most easy to organise the non - conservation of the coulomb field for the @xmath4-charge by use of virtual wormhole entrances with magnetic fluxes radiating out .",
    "these form effective virtual magnetic monopoles in the vacuum .",
    "the reason that it is profitable with monopoles violating the charge conservation for the @xmath4-charge is that we indeed can derive some formulas for the variation / development of the @xmath4-electric - charge relating it to the variation of @xmath40 on the sites of the monopoles ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : diverad ] ) ) , @xmath155    since @xmath156 is the charge density this formula tells us that , for instance , when a monopole is present , the variation rate of the charge @xmath157 contains a term @xmath158 on the site of a monopole whenever @xmath40 varies , @xmath5 , @xmath159 .",
    "the monopoles to be used here do not have to be genuine monopoles .",
    "they could be entrances to wormholes with magnetic flux going through  @xcite .",
    "we would not even have to use such genuinely existing monopolic wormhole entrances .",
    "it is rather sufficient to consider entrances which are virtually present in the vacuum .",
    "we shall imagine that there are many such wormholes virtually present with magnetic flux and that the entrances give rise to interactions with the various fields in the theory .",
    "we assume that interactions can be described by effective terms in the lagrangian density .",
    "at first they are only at the places where the entrances to the wormholes are .",
    "we shall , however , integrate over all the possible positions or movements for the wormholes  as part of the functional integration of feynman path integral .",
    "this has the implication that one can achieve naturally that such a model of wormholes can become effectively translational invariant .",
    "in fact one has to integrate over the positions  of the wormhole or baby universe entrances  with a translational invariant measure . that can actually be supported by a heisenberg - inequality type argument using that at least baby universes can not transport energy and momentum , because the information about these quantities is safely stored in the gravitational field at long distances from a ( supposed to be ) little baby universe .",
    "even for wormholes it is reasonable to integrate over all positions with a translational invariant measure .",
    "since it is clearly possible that any sort of particle could be scattered into a wormhole , the effective lagrangian density contribution from the entrance to a wormhole can contain terms annihilating or creating any combination of particles .",
    "thus any combination / product of fields is _ a priori _ possible and will come with some coefficient in the effective wormhole and baby universe lagrangian .",
    "now , however , there can be processes that can not really take place due to coulomb fields left behind . by this",
    "we mean that if we propose terms violating gauge symmetries for charges with light gauge particles associated there remains information outside .",
    "in fact there will be a coulomb field left , carrying the information about the charge of the particles which have gone into the wormhole .",
    "even if the particle goes deeply into the wormhole and maybe even out somewhere else far away , there will remain electric flux lines exiting from the entrance of the wormhole and even if no appropriate  may be different  particle is pulled out the entrance the wormhole itself will behave as a charged particle . in this way we can only have effective lagrangian density terms conserving the gauged charges corresponding to gauge particles with compton wave lengths which are long compared to the wormhole sizes .",
    "really what matters is , whether the gauge field around the wormhole can keep the information about what went into it . in the case of the conserved @xmath4-charge",
    "the @xmath160 , that should have ensured the stability of the coulomb field , does not correspond to a conserved current as in the usual electrodynamics .",
    "it is rather the current corresponding to the @xmath161 ( eq .  ( [ eq : shandred ] ) ) that is conserved .",
    "in fact we have just seen that if the axion field @xmath40 varies on the sites of the virtual monopoles we can / will have that @xmath160 and thus the charge varies .    in this way",
    "it should now be _ allowed _ to have lagrangian density terms due to the monopolic wormholes violating the @xmath4 .",
    "once such terms are allowed they are expected to be there and we will generate masses for particles which are only mass - protected by @xmath4 group .    once we have the symmetry strongly broken at the planck scale which is now expected there will no longer be a sign of the conservation and thus also no problem with the anomalies .",
    "the symmetry seems to be dynamically broken  not only spontaneously  because the effective lagrangians representing the wormhole and other space - time foam effects really have to be interpreted as dynamical breaking .",
    "we must also expect that it is rather impossible to keep the @xmath4-photon mass @xmath86 to be light compared to @xmath108 under such conditions .",
    "we conclude that seriously taking wormholes into account in this way , it results that the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation scheme _ does not work _ in @xmath0 dimensional limit .",
    "what happens is that the very strong constraint ensuring forces due to very large @xmath40 propagators lead to the possibility of coulomb fields around a wormhole entrance modified with time .",
    "this modification possibility in turn allows the effective lagrangian density corresponding to the absorption of the @xmath4-charges into wormholes .",
    "anomaly cancellation by the green - schwarz mechanism in the case of a certain @xmath0 dimension limit of a higher dimensioned string theory is questioned : we consider the gauge symmetry ( needed to the @xmath4 subgroup ) that allegedly results from breaking a larger string theory gauge group using a field @xmath40 derived from kalb - ramond @xmath162 that takes on a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value and thereby higgses the gauge field @xmath163 .",
    "this is manifested phenomenologically as an approximately conserved current without having the usual triangle summation anomaly requirement for avoiding gauge and mixed anomalies .",
    "this is referred to as green - schwarz anomaly cancellation because the special way of having anomaly cancellations for string theory mass states is inherited to the @xmath0 dimensional limit .",
    "if we have supersymmetry and such a charge with green - schwarz anomaly cancellation ( effectively in the @xmath0 dimensions ) , then according to the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite we have a fayet - iliopoulos d - term ( [ eq : anomalousfi ] ) which drives the dilaton field that is essentially in correspondence with the effective string coupling constant @xmath63 to be zero .",
    "that means that the theory becomes _ free _ and thus rather unrealistic .",
    "this is a severe trouble in itself for the models with a non - trivial anomaly cancellation mechanism .",
    "however , contrary to this argument , if we should assume that in some mysterious way it were possible to get a string theory after all with supersymmetry surviving and having a significant d - term and string coupling in spite of such green - schwarz cancellation , then the world sheet instantons would prevent the breaking strength of the surviving global charge conservation from going to zero .",
    "it is a major point of the present article that it is actually not achievable for the world sheet instantons do violate the @xmath4-charge conservation . in this way",
    "we could avoid the mystery of having a gauge theory breaking from a spontaneous symmetry breaking , which does not break the current conservation .",
    "provided that the world sheet instanton effects do not mysteriously cancel ( which is though less safe to assume than naively expected ) , this mystery would disappear .",
    "the authors working with the green - schwarz anomaly cancelling charges ( usually ) have in mind supersymmetric models .",
    "if the world sheet instanton effects would appear even in supersymmetric theories , the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation would become less suspicious of being pretended to behave strangely from the general point of view .",
    "however , due to the fayet - iliopoulos d - term expected when we have such charges , the string coupling constant @xmath76 may be driven to zero and the whole effect of world sheet instantons would disappear .",
    "this may though be not realistic because of bringing the whole string theory appears to be free .",
    "if this kind of effect could work causing a breaking of the global charge conservation and thus avoiding some of the strangeness one may still seek ( using the world sheet instantons ) to declare a @xmath4-charge needing the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation to have become less suspicious of being pretended to behave strangely from general point of view .",
    "however , one may still declare the way to be suspicious , in which the anomaly troubles are avoided in the energy range above the mass scale @xmath86 of the gauge particle : the gauge fields are constrained to never have the configuration leading to anomalies !    if one gets a breaking of charge @xmath4 due to the wormholes ( or world sheet instantons )",
    ", one could imagine as an interesting possibility to _ use this breaking",
    "_ instead of some spontaneous breaking induced from @xmath2 the fayet - iliopoulos d - term ( as @xcite proposes ) to provide the soft breaking which is needed to use the charge @xmath4 as a mass protecting charge to implement the large ratios of quark and lepton masses .",
    "we further expressed our worry and suspicion whether such an electrodynamics which is constrained by @xmath164 can really be considered as realistic on general physics grounds or whether it represents an unrealisable speculation concerning the relative orders of magnitude .",
    "however , we thought there are reasons to believe that the wormholes would give violation of the @xmath4 even above its higgsing scale .",
    "that could mean that wormholes break the @xmath4 symmetry completely under the use of @xmath164 .",
    "the point is that a very strong coupling of the @xmath40 field causes that coulomb field around the wormholes endings are not stable .",
