    "a broad range of diffusive processes on networks , from consensus formation @xcite to current flows on electric circuits  @xcite , can be modeled by random walks or , equivalently , by markov chains .",
    "their unbiased exploration of the underlying structure also makes them popular tools for designing algorithms for , e.g. , navigation and search on networks @xcite , defining central nodes in a given network @xcite , community detection @xcite , and respondent - driven sampling  @xcite . in tandem with these applications ,",
    "the impact of network structure on dynamics of random walks , including the hitting time , mixing time , and stationary density has been extensively studied .    however , recent studies identified limitations of the classical network paradigm , where dynamics is modeled by a dynamical process on a static underlying structure . in a broad range of empirical systems ,",
    "evidence suggests instead that dynamics presents non - trivial correlations between events and long - tailed interevent time distributions @xcite .",
    "these observations are incompatible with the poissonian statistics implicitly assumed in stochastic models , therefore calling for richer models for temporal networks @xcite .",
    "an important practical question concerns the impact of the temporality of a network on diffusion . in order to address this question ,",
    "a first approach consists in simulating random walks on real or synthesized data of time - stamped event sequences , and to compare their dynamical properties to those of properly defined null models @xcite .",
    "a second approach consists in studying analytically the properties of random walks on specific models of temporal networks . in most studies ,",
    "however , network structure changes at regular time intervals , and transitions between networks at different times are independent @xcite or markovian @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we follow the latter path to analytically model diffusion under the non - poissonian nature of interevent times .",
    "previous studies proposed modeling temporal networks as stochastic sequences of events obeying a prescribed distribution of interevent times attached on each link  @xcite . a random walk process , called the active random walk , was then defined as a renewal process ; i.e. , after a walker arrives at a node , the interevent times attached to all links incident to the node are reinitialized @xcite .",
    "despite its non - markovianity owing to the fact that the rate at which an event takes place depends on the time of the previous event , this stochastic process can be described by a generalized master equation , and some of its properties , such as the stationary density @xcite and the relaxation time @xcite , were analytically solved . in this work",
    ", we will first derive an analytical expression for the mean recurrence time for the active random walk .",
    "then , we consider a different non - renewal process , called the passive random walk , in which interevent times are reset only on the links traversed at each jump .",
    "we will use the fact that the passive random walk shows a stronger non - markovianity than the active random walk does because passive random walkers remember their past trajectories to some extent .",
    "finally , we will perform numerical simulations to test our analytical predictions and compare the stationary density and mean recurrence time between the two types of walks .",
    "we consider an undirected network on @xmath0 nodes .",
    "we denote the set of nodes by @xmath1 and the set of links by @xmath2 .",
    "we often refer to this network as the aggregate network because it is considered as the aggregation of the temporal network , which we introduce in the following , across time .",
    "stochastic temporal networks add a time dimension to the aggregated networks by assigning a random interevent time @xmath3 to each link @xmath4 in a renewal manner @xcite . for a chain network of three nodes , a hypothetical sequence of interevent times is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic passive ] . the interevent time , denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , for link @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic passive ] , is the interval between two consecutive activation events of the link .",
    "we denote the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath3 by @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the mean of @xmath3 is finite .",
    "link activation is an instantaneous event , and we assume that the random walker moves from the current node to the neighboring node through the activated link whenever it is possible . the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic passive ] indicates that , if the walker starts from node 1 at @xmath10 , it moves to node 2 at @xmath11 .",
    "then , it moves back to node 1 at @xmath12 .",
    "after coming back to node 2 at @xmath13 , the walker transits to node 3 at @xmath14 .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "first , some activation events , such as those immediately following the interevent times @xmath15 and @xmath16 , may not be used by a walker .",
    "second , although the walker s movement as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic passive ] may look deterministic , it is stochastic because the interevent times are random variables .",
    "third , the probability that more than one links are simultaneously activated is equal to zero because the model is defined in continuous time .",
    "fourth , the walker is assumed not to have any internal waiting time . therefore , the walker instantaneously moves upon the activation of a link incident to the walker s location .",
    "fifth , the continuous - time nature of our model makes it different from the previously proposed discrete - time random walk defined on the so - called activity driven model @xcite . a main difference between the present model and those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the former generates interevent times from a given pdf , which lends itself to an analytical study of the process , whereas the latter uses interevent times observed in real data ( and their randomizations ) , more appropriate for the study of empirical data .",
    "we analyze two versions of random walks on stochastic temporal networks @xcite .",
    "the first version is the so - called active random walk . in the active random walk ,",
    "when the random walker arrives at a node , it reinitializes the interevent times on all links , which makes the process renewal . in this case , the waiting time , i.e. , the time for which a walker waits on a node before the link appears , is equivalent to the interevent time @xcite . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic active ] , once the random walker moves from node 1 to node 2 at @xmath11 , the new interevent times , denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are independently drawn . because @xmath19 , the walker moves to node 3 at @xmath20 .",
    "it should be noted that interevent times for link @xmath21 before @xmath11 do not matter for the movement of the walker in question , reflecting the renewal nature of the active random walk .",
    "phenomena in which a node starts something in response to an external input or the arrival to the node might be represented by the active walk .",
    "possible examples include the broadcasting of gossips @xcite and random surfing on the world wide web by users .",
    "in the latter case , a user that has arrived at a webpage may stay there looking at the content .",
    "then , after a randomly distributed amount of time , the user may decide to jump to a different webpage , which is selected with equal probability among the hyperlinks that the original page has .",
    "the second version is the so - called passive random walk , which does not assume the reinitialization at all links .",
    "when the random walker moves to a neighbor through link @xmath8 , a new interevent time is drawn only for @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , the example shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic passive ] corresponds to the passive random walk .",
    "transmission of infectious diseases or information may be better described with the passive than active random walk because infection of a node does not seem to instantaneously affect interevent times on other links @xcite . in other words , to a first - order approximation , the inter - contact time on any link @xmath8 can be regarded to obey a given distribution and is not altered by whether an infection occurs upon the contact .",
    "then , a pathogen or piece of information starting from an initial node may travel to other nodes via the passive random walk .",
    "the complexity of the passive random walk lies in its non - renewal nature . in other words , transition rates of the passive random walk",
    "depend on the trajectory that the walker has taken such that we have to account for the entire trajectory of the random walker to accurately evaluate its behavior .",
    "it should be noted that for exponentially distributed interevent times the active and passive random walks are identical and reduce to the usual continuous - time random walk on the aggregate ( i.e. , static ) network .",
    "the walker starts at node 1 at @xmath10 .",
    "the link activation is represented by horizontal bars . @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) represents the @xmath24th interevent time on link @xmath8 .",

    "we first review these results ( secs .  [ sub : formulate active ] and [ sub : steady state active ] ) .",
