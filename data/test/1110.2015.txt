    "the spectrum of classical fields in various cosmological space - times is a well - established area , which is a starting point for quantization of the fields in the curved backgrounds .",
    "by now it includes a detailed knowledge of spectra for _ massless _ scalar and dirac fields @xcite in the rotating ( but not expanding ) gdel - like universes @xcite .",
    "the massless scalar field in the expanding and rotating background was considered by panov @xcite . yet , all these works were devoted solely to `` normal '' nontachyonic fields .",
    "the first comprehensive study of would be particles moving faster than light , i.e. tachyons , was done as early as 1962 @xcite . since that time",
    "there have been a number of other theoretical studies on the various properties of these hypothetical particles in quantum field theory , string theory , and gravitation @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems with tachyons is their instability .",
    "indeed , one can easily see that in the minkowski space - time @xmath4 , the klein - gordon equation with the negative values of @xmath5 @xmath6 allows for the normalizable exponentially growing modes @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "this means that vacuum fluctuations of the field will grow without the bound leading to the instability and decay of the tachyonic state . strictly speaking ,",
    "the above instability creates unsurpassable difficulties in quantization , so that the `` tachyon '' has never been considered seriously by the majority of researchers as a real quantum particle , but rather like a synonym of the onset of instability in the system .",
    "tachyons also play an important role in cosmology , where they are used in the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the tachyonic nature of the neutrino was proposed in the 1980s @xcite , and once one accepts the conception of the tachyon , it would be natural to expect a number of different tachyonic particles with various masses . yet , today we observe only single particles , neutrino , which potentially could be a tachyon .",
    "though , there are also arguments against the tachyonic nature of the neutrino , to which we shall possibly contribute one more argument here .",
    "if one supposes the tachyonic nature of a superluminal neutrino , then a straightforward question is why we observe only a single candidate for the tachyon , with a mass that is apparently much smaller than the electron mass and why `` heavy '' tachyons can not be observed ? in this work",
    "we shall show that only very light tachyons can be classically stable in a number of rotating cosmological backgrounds . at first glance",
    ", this could answer both questions posed above : the instability and the selectivity in favor of the lightest particles .",
    "the universe is supposed to be expanding , so that the initial rotation should have mostly been damped today .",
    "therefore , as only a very slow rotation of the universe is allowed by current observations , the stability is possible only for those tachyons that are many orders lighter than the electron .",
    "yet , we observed that the threshold of instability occurs at a tiny mass which seems to be too small to provide superluminality of the standard model particles .",
    "previously , one of us reported on the stability gap for tachyons in the pure gdel - like nonexpanding space - times @xcite . here",
    "we shall generalize this result to a more realistic situation of expanding , rotating universe and shall make estimates for the upper bound of tachyon s mass from the current upper bound on the rotation rate of the universe and the hubble constant",
    ".    another aim of our research , which is not connected to supeluminality issues , is analysis of spectra of `` normal '' ( tardyon ) fields in the expanding and rotating universe .",
    "we have found a number of distinctions from the previously studied cases of scalar fields in these backgrounds , which may raise new problems under quantization of these fields .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : scalarfield ] is devoted to the stability of a scalar tachyonic field , and sec .",
    "[ sec : diracfield ] deals with massive dirac tachyons . sec .",
    "[ sec : qnms ] summarizes the spectrum of tardyonic scalar and dirac fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the obtained results and open problems .",
    "a wide class of rotating and expanding cosmological solutions can be described by the gdel - like metric @xmath9 which includes both causal and noncausal generalizations @xcite of the classical gdel solution @xcite .",
    "the gdel metric is reproduced if @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "although here we shall use the cartesian coordinates , let us note that the metric ( [ metric ] ) can be rewritten in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 as follows : @xmath13 if the following inequality is fulfilled @xmath14 or simply , @xmath15 no closed time - like curves are allowed for the space - time .",
    "this is an example of the causal cosmological solutions suggested in @xcite .",
    "one can see that value of @xmath16 does not change our estimations for the order of the tachyon mass , so that , qualitatively , our conclusions will not depend on the causality of the background space - time .",
    "following @xcite we introduce the new coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 in terms of these new coordinates the metric takes form , @xmath22 we can separate the variables in the klein - gordon equation ( [ kgequation ] ) , using the following ansatz @xmath23 then , the wave - like equation can be written as follows : @xmath24 let us be limited by an adiabatic expansion of the universe , i.e. we shall consider the radius of the universe @xmath25 and the hubble parameter @xmath26 as constants : @xmath27 then , following @xcite , we introduce the frequencies of the proper oscillations of the universe as @xmath28 where @xmath29 satisfies the following equation @xmath30    eq . ( [ scalar - wavelike ] ) has a regular singular point at @xmath31 and an irregular singular point at @xmath32 with the asymptotical behavior @xmath33    let us notice , that the asymptotically gdel space - time , as well as the asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) one , is not globally hyperbolic , so that mathematically strict analytical proof of the stability should also include the detailed consideration of the well - posedness of the initial value problem .",
    "we shall study only normalizable solutions , i.e. @xmath34 in order to satisfy convergence conditions at both endpoints of the integral we require @xmath35    in terms of the new variable @xmath36 , @xmath37 the equation takes the following form @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . taking into account the asymptotical behavior of the wave equation",
    ", we introduce a new function @xmath41 , @xmath42 choosing @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , we find that the function @xmath41 satisfies the kummer s equation @xmath45 the only solution , which satisfies ( [ zerobc ] ) as @xmath46 , is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "as @xmath49 , @xmath48 grows exponentially and violates ( [ infbc ] ) unless @xmath50 is a nonpositive integer .",
    "thus , @xmath51 where @xmath52 finally , we find @xmath53 a general solution to ( [ spectreq ] ) gives us an analytic expression for the frequency @xmath54 :    @xmath55    when @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we have the nonexpanding gdel space - time . when the expression under the square root is positive in the above equation , @xmath54 is pure real , so that the tachyon is stable .",
    "thus , the upper bound on the tachyon s mass reads @xmath59 which coincides with eq .",
    "( 13 ) of @xcite .",
    "when @xmath60 , the expression for @xmath54 is formally reduced to the one in @xcite : @xmath61    there are unstable modes in the spectrum if @xmath62 allowing for tachyons with very small mass @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the rotation parameter measured in units of the hubble constant .",
    "estimations in @xcite show that @xmath65 can be equal to @xmath66 .",
    "the hubble constant is of order @xmath67 , giving an estimation for the tachyon mass @xmath68 is the electron mass .",
    "the estimation for the upper limit on the universe s rotation certainly crucially depends on the cosmological model under consideration ( see for instance a recent review on the observational aspects of the global rotation @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the upper limit for the global rotation that we have used is most physically relevant as it deals with the same cosmological model .",
    "apparently , the most authoritative approach to finding an upper constraint on the universes rotation is based on the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmba ) data of nasa , owing to their precision .",
    "constraints for nonflat cosmological models , including the gdel - friedman ones , are in the range @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the analysis of the so - called sachs - wolf effect ( the gravitational redshift of photons in the cosmic microwave background , which makes the cosmic microwave background spectrum uneven ) leads to the @xmath70 constraint for the global rotation .",
    "if one considers this constraint of @xmath70 as physically relevant , then the estimated upper limit on mass stability will be one order less than in eq .",

    ", we study only the normalizable solutions @xmath93 which imply the same requirements for the endpoints as for the scalar field ( [ zerobc]),([infbc ] ) .",
    "( [ dirac - wavelike ] ) has the same form as ( [ kummer - like ] ) with the coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 given by @xmath96    from ( [ spectreq ] ) one finds @xmath97 the `` - '' sign for @xmath98 violates the conditions of convergence of the dirac field norm ( see @xcite for details ) , so that we are able to write both solutions as @xmath99    for @xmath60 the spectrum of the wave - like equation takes the following simple form @xmath100 then , for @xmath60 the instability condition is @xmath101 since the imaginary part of @xmath102 reaches its maximum for @xmath103 and @xmath104 the bound for fermion mass does not depend on the universe s rotation in this case , and , @xmath105 however , for @xmath106 , and , in particular , for the gdel case ( @xmath56 ) , the bound on the tachyon mass depends on the rotation parameter .",
    "the instability condition becomes @xmath107    from the formula @xmath108 we conclude that @xmath98 corresponds to the most unstable mode , for which we find ( for @xmath109 ) the following expression : @xmath110 finally we find that the tachyon is stable if latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     for the gdel - like solution ( @xmath56 ) and the quick rotation scenario ( @xmath112 ) , we obtain the tachyon mass bound of half order higher than the hubble parameter @xmath113    let us notice , that if @xmath114 the expression inside the square root in ( [ square - root1 ] ) , ( [ square - root2 ] ) can always be negative for sufficiently large @xmath115 , even for the massless case .",
    "thus , for @xmath114 tachyons ( both scalar and dirac ) are unstable , yet the instability occurs for the normal matter as well , making this case quite exotic . in summary ,",
    "noncausal space - times with @xmath116 and causal with @xmath117 allow for the tachyon s stability , while causal space - time with @xmath114 is a quite exotic one , because not only tachyonic matter , but also the normal one is unstable .",
    "first let us note , that solutions of ( [ spectreq ] ) are not always also the solutions of ( [ fspectreq ] ) .",
    "because of the requirement for the real part of @xmath43 ( [ fspectreq ] ) , one can see that @xmath94 must always have a negative real part , which implies that the real part of @xmath54 has an opposite to the @xmath118 sign and always has a minimal value .",
    "that is why if one studies both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath54 , he must discard solutions that do not satisfy ( [ fspectreq ] ) .",
    "when @xmath119 we can prove that eq .",
    "( [ fspectreq ] ) is not satisfied for all of the modes of ( [ square - root1 ] ) for which the sign of the real part of the square root is @xmath120 . indeed ,",
    ",    @xmath121    from which it follows that @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath119 the quasinormal spectrum is @xmath123 similarly , we can prove that for the dirac field @xmath124 this was also shown for a particular value of @xmath16 , @xmath125 , in @xcite .",
    "one can see , that for @xmath126 the frequencies have an imaginary part of order @xmath127 , which corresponds to the decay of the amplitude due to expansion of the universe .",
    "the real part of the frequencies form qualitatively the same picture as that for @xmath57 ( see figs .",
    "[ diracqnms],[diracqnmsm ] ) .    from fig .",
    "[ diracqnmsm ] we observe that quasinormal spectra are not the same for particles of opposite chiralities .",
    "the spectrum for the right - handed chirality can be obtained by the replacing @xmath128 in ( [ left - handed ] ) . since for massless particles",
    "the helicity is an invariant quantity , we observe a continuous dependence of the qnms on @xmath2 ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ diracqnmsm ] ) .",
    "discontinuity for the massive particles of the same chirality as @xmath129 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ diracqnmsm ] ) reflects a nontrivial dependence of qnms on helicity , which is not an invariant quantity in this case .",
    "the left and right limits as @xmath130 correspond to particles with different dominant helicities that are described by the same left - handed chirality .",
    "if one considers opposite chiralities for the positive and negative values of @xmath2 , implying domination of the same helicity , the figure is symmetric for both massive and massless particles and has no discontinuity when @xmath131 .",
    "note , that normalizable solutions exist only when @xmath132 . for @xmath133 ,",
    "( [ scalar - wavelike ] ) reads @xmath134 whose general solution is @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "the only nondivergent solutions is constant when @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "however , for these solutions the integrals ( [ norma ] ) and ( [ normadirac ] ) diverge .",
    "in this work we have shown how the cosmological rotation and expansion can influence the stability of tachyons and the spectrum of classical tardyon fields .",
    "the stability gap for tachyons was expected from the similarities between the spectrum of asymptotically gdel @xcite and ads space - times .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was noted that the spectrum of black holes in the 5-dimensional asymptotically gdel space - time , is qualitatively similar to the normal modes of pure gdel space - time and is quite different from the quasinormal modes of the black hole in asymptotically flat space - time . in the limit of the vanishing black hole radius ,",
    "quasinormal modes approach the normal modes of the pure gdel space .",
    "the same behavior takes place for black holes in ads space - time @xcite , where the anti - de sitter radius @xmath139 plays the role of the universe s rotation rate @xmath140 .",
    "here we have found that the spectrum and stability of dirac tachyons is quite different from the scalar one : while the scalar tachyons do not need expansion for the stability gap , that is , the gap exists for rotating and not expanding models , dirac tachyons are unstable in the nonexpanding cosmological models . yet , for both scalars and neutrino tachyons the coupling of rotation and expansion can enlarge the stability gap , making thereby cosmological rotation an important stabilizing factor .",
    "finally , since we have shown that the upper bound on the tachyon mass in all of the above cases is quite small , and is definitely many orders less than the electron s mass , one could suppose that this could explan why today only the lightest particles ( though with nonzero mass , such as neutrinos ) could be tachyonic .",
    "an important issue which was beyond our consideration is quantization of the considered fields in the expanding gdel - like backgrounds .",
    "one can show that the spectrum of bound states considered here do not form a complete set , so that the quantization of massive fields in such space - times is a nontrivial question , not to mention the tachyonic nature of the fields . yet , if such a quantization is performed , the effort will pay off , allowing for a quantum description of stable tachyons .",
    "in addition , we have described the spectra of tardyon fields in detail .",
    "the spectrum of the massive scalar or dirac fields do not form a complete set and do not have unstable normalizable modes .",
    "frequencies for a massive dirac field ( as well as a massless one ) are not symmetric relative to the @xmath2 axis , where @xmath2 is the component of the wave vector . a new feature which that we observe for the massive dirac field is the discontinuity of the frequency as a function of @xmath2 at @xmath141 .",
