    "flow rate measurements of liquid metals are required in various technological processes ranging from the cooling of nuclear reactors to the dosing and casting of molten metals.@xcite electromagnetic flowmeters are essential in the diagnostics and automatic control of such processes . a variety of electromagnetic flowmeters have been developed starting from the late 1940s and described by shercliff.@xcite the standard approach is to determine the flow rate by measuring the potential difference induced between a pair of electrodes by a flow of conducting liquid in the magnetic field.@xcite this approach is now well developed and works reliably for common liquids like water,@xcite but not so for liquid metals .",
    "major problem in molten metals , especially at elevated temperatures , is the electrode corrosion and other interfacial effects , which can cause a spurious potential difference between the electrodes .",
    "the electrode problem is avoided by contactless eddy - current flowmeters , which determine the flow rate by sensing the flow - induced perturbation in an applied magnetic field.@xcite the main problem with this type of flowmeters is the weak field perturbation which may be caused not only by the flow .",
    "we showed recently that the flow - induced phase shift of ac magnetic field is more reliable for flow rate measurements than the amplitude perturbation.@xcite    another contactless techniques for flow rate measurements in liquid metals is the so - called magnetic flywheel invented by shercliff,@xcite who prescribes _ a `` plurality '' _ of permanent magnets distributed equidistantly along the circumference of a disk , which is mounted on an axle and placed close to a tube carrying the liquid metal flow .",
    "the eddy currents induced by the flow across the magnetic field interact with the magnets by entraining them , which makes the disk rotate with a rate proportional to that of the flow .",
    "this type of flowmeter , described also in the textbook by shercliff@xcite and extensively used by bucenieks,@xcite was recently successfully reembodied under the name of the lorentz force velocimetry ( lfv).@xcite    recently , we suggested an alternative and much more compact design of such a flowmeter , which conversely to shercliff s flywheel uses just a single magnet mounted on the axle it can freely rotate around and magnetized perpendicularly to it.@xcite we also introduced a basic mathematical model and presented first experimental implementation of this type of flowmeter.@xcite when such a magnet is placed properly at a tube with the liquid metal flow , it starts to revolve similarly to shercliff s flywheel .",
    "but in contrast to the latter , which is driven by the electromagnetic force acting on separate magnets , the single magnet is set into rotation only by the torque . this driving torque is due to the eddy currents induced by the flow across the magnetic field . as the magnet starts to rotate ,",
    "additional eddy currents are induced , which brake the rotation .",
    "an equilibrium rotation rate is attained when the braking torque balances the driving one , and this rate depends only on the flow velocity and the flowmeter arrangement , whereas it is independent of the electromagnetic torque itself .",
    "thus , the equilibrium rotation rate is affected neither by the magnet strength nor by the electrical conductivity of the liquid metal provided that the friction on the magnet is negligible .",
    "this a major advantage of the single - magnet rotary flowmeter over the lfv approach , which relies on direct force measurements.@xcite    in this paper , we present an extended theory of the single - magnet rotary flowmeter and compare it with experimental results .",
    "two limiting cases of long and short magnets are analyzed using linear - dipole and single - dipole approximations .",
    "we obtain simple analytic solutions for the force and torque on slowly moving and rotating magnets due to eddy currents in the layers of infinite horizontal extent and arbitrary depth .",
    "this allows us to find the equilibrium rotation rate of the magnet at which the torques due to the translation and rotation balance each other .",
    "we also consider an active approach , where the force on the magnet is used to control its rotation rate so that the resulting force vanishes .",
    "this rotation rate , similarly to the equilibrium one , is proportional to the layer velocity and independent of its conductivity and the magnet strength .",
    "the torque on a magnetic dipole rotating about an axis normal to a thin sheet has been calculated by smythe using an original receding image method.@xcite reitz uses this method to calculate the lift and drag forces on the coils of various geometries moving with constant velocity above a conducting thin plate.@xcite the lift force , which at high speeds approaches the force between the coil and its image located directly below it , varies as the velocity squared in the low - speed limit considered in this paper .",
    "the drag force is found to vary inversely and directly with the velocity at low and high speeds , respectively .",
    "palmer finds analytical expressions for the eddy current forces on a circular current loop moving with a constant velocity parallel to a thin conducting sheet.@xcite the force on a rectangular coil moving above a conducting slab has been calculated numerically by reitz and davis using the fourier transform method.@xcite the same problem for the magnetic dipole of arbitrary orientation placed next to a thin slowly moving slab is addressed by kirpo _",
    "@xcite the force and torque on a transversely oriented dipole above a slowly moving plane layer of arbitrary thickness has been found analytically in the context of the lfv.@xcite fast computation of forces on moving magnets are of interested also for the eddy current force testing techniques.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the following section presents two simple mathematical models of the single - magnet rotary flowmeter , which are used to calculate analytically the force and torque on the magnets moving and rotating slowly above a layer of infinite lateral extent .",

    "the magnetic field of linear dipole is @xmath21 eddy currents are induced by two effects : the translation of the layer and the temporal variation of the magnetic field due to its rotation .",
    "the latter vanishes in the co - rotating frame of reference , where the magnetic field is stationary , while the layer appears to move with the resulting velocity @xmath22 which contains also an apparent rotational motion of the layer @xmath23 opposite to that of the magnet .",
    "the density of eddy currents is given by ohm s law for a moving medium @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electric potential .",
    "in this case , no electric potential is induced because the e.m.f . , @xmath26 is both solenoidal and tangential to the surface .",
    "if the induced magnetic field is negligible as originally assumed , eddy currents can be represented as the superposition @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the currents induced by the translation and rotation , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that in the approximation under consideration with a fixed magnetic field distribution , eddy currents are determined only by the instantaneous velocities . besides that eddy currents are coplanar to the surface and , thus , mutually independent over the depth of the layer",
    "consequently , a layer of finite thickness may be represented as a semi - infinite one with zero velocity at @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance of the lower boundary of finite - thickness layer from the magnet .",
    "this , in turn , is equivalent to the superposition of two semi - infinite layers with the second layer at @xmath32 moving oppositely to the first one at @xmath33 so that the resulting velocity vanishes at @xmath34 in the following , this approach allows us to construct the solution for a finite - thickness layer by taking the difference of two half - space solutions , which is subsequently denoted by @xmath35_{h_{1}}^{h_{2}},$ ] where @xmath36 stands either for the force or the torque due to the eddy currents in a half - space .",
    "moreover , by the same arguments , this approach can easily be extended to @xmath7-dependent velocity distributions @xmath37 , for which general solution can be constructed as a superposition of solutions for thin layers moving with various velocities given by @xmath38 where @xmath39_{h_{1}}^{h_{2}}/\\left[z\\right]_{h_{1}}^{h_{2}}$ ] for @xmath40 and @xmath41    the linear force density experienced by an infinitely long magnet due to the layer translation , which according to the momentum conservation law is opposite to that acting upon the layer itself , can be written as @xmath42 where the integral is taken over the @xmath43-cross - section of the layer .",
    "the @xmath0-component of force is absent due to the @xmath44 reflection symmetry . in the low - speed limit under consideration , when force varies linearly with the velocity , there is also no @xmath7-component of force .",
    "this is the case because according to the linearity @xmath45 when @xmath46 while the latter transformation is equivalent to the rotation of the coordinate system by @xmath47 around the @xmath7-axis , which leaves the @xmath7-components invariant . in polar",
