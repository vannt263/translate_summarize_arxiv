    "the quantization of polarized gravitational cylindrical waves has received a lot of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that this system provides a tractable , yet non - trivial , reduction of full general relativity and hence is an ideal framework to explore several issues involved in the quantization of gravity .",
    "some intriguing phenomena , related to the existence of large quantum gravity effects , have been discussed by studying precisely this model @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that some manifestations of quantum gravity , such as the smearing of light cones are , indeed , present and can be understood in this simplified setting @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting points behind the obtained results is the realization of the fact that the physical hamiltonian is a function of the free field hamiltonian for a 2 + 1 dimensional , axially symmetric , massless scalar field evolving in an auxiliary minkowski background @xcite .",
    "as we show in the first section of the paper , this free hamiltonian naturally appears when one linearizes the system , thus suggesting that , in a precise sense , it can be considered as the free part of an interacting model .",
    "however the full interacting hamiltonian is obtained by adding a very specific type of terms to the free part , namely , just functions of it . here",
    "we plan to explore the consequences of this functional relation between the two physically relevant hamiltonians for the system and explore how this affects the causal structure of quantum spacetime . to this end we will pay attention to the smearing of the light cones due to quantum gravity effects within the framework of linearly polarized cylindrical waves . instead of considering the full information encoded in the metric tensor we will concentrate on the causal structure provided by light cones .",
    "an interesting , albeit somewhat indirect way , to look at this structure is to study the commutators of field operators at different spacetime points .",
    "these are the basic objects to discuss the commutativity of observables and the microcausality of the model ; conventionally , a physical model should be such that observables commute for space - like intervals .",
    "this has been discussed in the standard perturbative quantum field theory framework for simple examples such as scalar or fermion fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , microcausality is one of the key conditions to prove such important results as the spin - statistics theorem @xcite",
    ".    here we will use the commutator of the scalar field that describes linearly polarized cylindrical waves as a way to get information about the causal structure of quantum spacetime . as we show later",
    "it is possible to give exact expressions for this commutator both for the evolution provided by the free and the full physical hamiltonians .",
    "we will use these expressions to study in a quantitative way the smearing of the light cones as a function of the three - dimensional gravitational constant and explore some physical issues , in particular the appearance of singularities as a consequence of having a hamiltonian bounded from above @xcite .",

    "actually , we can set @xmath53 by demanding that the total lapse equals the unity at spatial infinity . on the other hand , taking into account the regularity condition ( [ reg ] ) , the solution to the hamiltonian constraint is simply @xmath54 .",
    "this allows us to remove the canonical pair @xmath55 from the system and arrive at a constraint - free model in linearized gravity .",

    "the scalar field @xmath26 determines the norm of the killing vector @xmath58 , and appears in the four - dimensional metric of the gauge - fixed , linearized model in the form ( [ metlin ] ) , but with @xmath59 substituted by the flat metric @xmath60 where we have renamed @xmath61 the time coordinate of the reduced system .",
    "summarizing , the perturbative description provided in linearized gravity for cylindrical waves with linear polarization around four - dimensional minkowski spacetime is equivalent to a massless scalar field with axial symmetry in a three - dimensional flat background .",
    "the dynamics of this field is dictated by the free hamiltonian @xmath57 , which generates the evolution in the minkowskian time @xmath61 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the action and metric of the gauge - fixed model in linearized gravity reproduce in fact the results that one would obtain from the gauge - fixed model in full cylindrical gravity by working just in the first perturbative order , i.e. , by keeping in the action and metric , respectively , up to quadratic and linear terms in the field @xmath26 and its momentum . in this sense , the gauge fixing and linearization procedures commute .",
    "one of the significant features of gravitational cylindrical waves is the existence of two distinct , physically relevant hamiltonians ( or equivalently two distinct time coordinates ) to define both the classical and quantum evolution .",
    "one is the hamiltonian @xmath57 [ given in eq .",
    "( [ ham0 ] ) ] that generates the dynamics in the linearized gravitational theory ; the other is the hamiltonian @xmath62 that provides the energy per unit length along the symmetry axis in general relativity @xcite . in fact , they are functionally dependent , since @xmath63 . in order to gain insight into the relation that can be established between the dynamics associated with these two different hamiltonians , we open this section by discussing a similar situation in a very simple example provided by the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the usual description of the harmonic oscillator in a phase space coordinatized by @xmath64 comes from its standard hamiltonian @xmath65 .",
    "the dynamics is given by the hamilton equations @xmath66 the general solution can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and its complex conjugate @xmath69 are fixed by the initial conditions .    consider next a phase space @xmath70 with hamiltonian @xmath71 , i.e. a function of the standard hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "for instance , the case @xmath72 arises in the context of quantum optics , in relation with the propagation of light in non - linear kerr media @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion now read @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the derivative of @xmath75 with respect to its argument .",
    "these new equations can be easily solved by means of a change of time .",
    "specifically , making use of the time independence of the hamiltonian @xmath76 ( @xmath77 on solutions to the equations of motion ) , we can introduce the new time parameter @xmath78 .",
    "then , the functions @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 $ ] and the new time @xmath61 serve us to transform the hamilton equations into the standard ones corresponding to the harmonic oscillator .",

    "the situation in the quantum theory is quite different .",
    "the reason lies on the fact than in quantum mechanics a physical state does not need to have a definite energy .",
    "then , a `` change of time '' of the form @xmath82 has non - trivial consequences for the dynamics .",
    "the usual quantum theory for the harmonic oscillator can be described by introducing a fock space with creation and annihilation operators @xmath69 , @xmath68 .",
    "every initial state can be expressed as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 are fourier coefficients ( with the convenient normalization ) and @xmath85 are energy eigenvectors ( that is , @xmath86 ) . in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "evolving with @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 however , if the same state @xmath89 evolves in time according to the evolution generated by @xmath90 , we get and @xmath90 act on the same hilbert space . moreover , if we demand the function @xmath75 to have a unique absolute minimum at @xmath91 , the two hamiltonians have also the same vacuum . ]",
    "@xmath92 hence we do not recover an analogous situation to that found in the classical system by replacing ( formally ) the time @xmath61 in @xmath93 with @xmath82 , because @xmath94 except for linear homogeneous functions @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the properties of the states @xmath93 and @xmath95 are quite different . for example , if we consider the bounded hamiltonian @xmath96 it is obvious that the high energy contributions to @xmath95 are essentially frozen in time with respect to the evolution of the low energy ones , in the sense that the phase of the former type of contributions remains practically coherent in time .",
    "let us turn now to the discussion of our gravitational system .",
    "we will deal with the einstein - rosen family of linearly polarized gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "these waves display the so - called whole cylindrical symmetry @xcite , namely , they correspond to topologically trivial spacetimes which possess two linearly independent , commuting , spacelike , and hypersurface orthogonal killing vector fields .",
    "it is well known @xcite that these spacetimes admit coordinates @xmath97 such that the metric is given by @xmath98 where @xmath26 and @xmath8 are functions of only @xmath11 and @xmath61 .",

    "the commutator for the physical hamiltonian , as it usually happens for interacting theories , is no longer a c - number , so one has to consider its matrix elements . by concentrating on the vacuum expectation value",
    "we have been able to see several interesting phenomena : a spreading of the light cone as a function of the gravitational constant , the disappearance of the singularity present in the free case due to the smearing of the symmetry axis and the appearance of a new type of singularity associated with the fact that the energy is bounded from above .",
    "this new singularity is also present in the other expectation values discussed in the paper , namely for one - particle states and coherent states , and appears to be a generic feature of the model .",
    "there are several open questions that we plan to address in future work .",
