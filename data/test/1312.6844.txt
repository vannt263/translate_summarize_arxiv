    "these structures increase their intensity and harden substantially by lowering the temperature , remaining asymmetric up to the lowest temperature of 15 k , see figure 6 ( a ) . because the optical phonon region for the a@xmath28 symmetry modes is below 350 @xmath3 we assigned these modes as magnetic ordering related from the following reasons :    _ ( i ) _ the magnetic susceptibility measurements@xcite show a broad peak between 400 k and 500 k with a maximum around @xmath43=450 k and an abrupt decrease towards zero at @xmath2=240 k. this shape of the magnetic susceptibility is observed in many two - dimensional magnetic systems @xcite including the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors@xcite and is connected to the short - range correlation of the local moments@xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath2/@xmath43 is usually used to estimate the extent of the low - dimensional magnetic correlations@xcite . as @xmath2/@xmath43 in bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o",
    "is 0.53 , it can be concluded that bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o is a quasi - two - dimensional magnetic system , or more precisely spin - ladder ( dimer ) system .    _",
    "( ii ) _ magnon related continuum appears only in the ( bb ) polarisation , _",
    "i.e. _ in the direction where the light polarization is colinear with spin orientation polarization .    _",
    "( iii ) _ in spin - ladder systems a triplet gap mode and two magnon continuum may appear in the raman spectra @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , the magnetic structure of bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o may be considered as the afm spin - ladder ( dimer ) structure with non - negligible inter - ladder ( dimer ) interaction ( strong fe - o - fe super - exchange interaction @xmath10 along the rungs of the s=2 spin - ladders is dominant ; the inter - ladder interaction @xmath11 is more than three times weaker than along the rungs@xcite ) .",
    "raman scattering spectra of the afm dimer magnetic structure was a subject of our interest in ref .",
    ", where we have shown that spin dimmer structure in cav@xmath0o@xmath9 is represented in the form of two - magnon continuum with the singularities of the one - dimensional density of ( two - magnon ) states . in the case of bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o",
    "the two magnon continuum is well separated from the a@xmath28 optical phonon range .",
    "the onset of the magnetic continuum appears at about 425 @xmath3 ( 437 @xmath3 ) at room temperature ( 15 k ) as an asymmetric shape line with a tail towards higher energies ( m@xmath44 critical point in the 1d density of magnon states ) .",
    "this continuum ends with the @xmath45-shape line ( m@xmath46 critical point in the 1d density of magnon states ) peaked at about 645 @xmath3 ( 655 @xmath3 ) at room temperature ( 15 k ) .",
    "the total width of the continuum is estimated to be around 230 @xmath3 ( 15 k ) .",
    "the energy of the 437 @xmath3 line saturates at temperatures below 100 k , see the inset of fig .",
    "( iv ) _ the well defined peak around 2@xmath35 is expected in the raman spectra of the spin - ladder ( dimer ) , due to the singularities of the one - dimensional density of two - magnon states@xcite .",
    "thus , we assigned the onset of the magnon continuum to 2@xmath35= 437 @xmath3 ( 15 k ) and obtain the spin - gap in bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o to be 219 @xmath3 ( 27 mev ) .    _",
    "( v ) _ there is a common belief that the short - range magnetic order in oxychalcogenides extends at least up to temperature of 2@xmath2.@xcite in order to check this assumption we have measured raman spectra for the ( bb ) polarization at high temperatures up to 350 @xmath15c ( 623 k ) .",
    "as it can be seen from fig 6 ( b ) the two magnon continuum singularity modes decrease their intensity in comparison to phonon modes and at temperature of about 623 k these modes completely disappear .",
    "accordingly , we concluded that the short - range magnetic order in bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o persist up to about 2.6@xmath2 .",
    "finally , we believe that in the short - range order region [ between @xmath2 and 2.6@xmath2 , see the inset in fig . 6 ( b ) ] there are also antiferromagnetic fluctuations of local magnetic moments .",
    "spin fluctuations are coupled with the b@xmath1 symmetry phonon modes .",
    "this coupling is manifested in the appearance of the b@xmath1 mode line shape asymmetry ( the fano - profile shape ) . below @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , this asymmetry vanishes as a system enters the long - range ordered antiferromagnetic state .",
    "we have measured the polarized raman scattering spectra of the bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o single crystals at various temperatures .",
    "all raman - active modes from ( ab ) plane predicted by factor - group analysis have been experimentally observed and assigned .",
    "frequencies of these modes are in rather good agreement with the lattice dynamics calculations .",
    "the a@xmath27 and b@xmath1 mode linewidths and energies change substantially at temperatures below @xmath2=240 k , where system becomes antiferromagneticaly long - range ordered . at frequencies higher than the a@xmath1 optical phonon range we have observed magnon continuum , which is related to the afm dimer structure .",
    "spin gap value of 27 mev is obtained from the position of the onset of the magnetic continuum .",
    "high temperature raman scattering measurements shows that the short - range magnetic order disappears at about 2.6@xmath2 . in the short - range order region",
    "we have observed coupling of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with the b@xmath1 symmetry phonons .",
    "it would be interesting to test and compare our results of the magnetic correlations with low temperature neutron scattering study of the bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o crystal , as well as , theoretical calculations of magnon dispersions in the s=2 spin ladder ( dimer ) barium iron oxyselenide compound .",
