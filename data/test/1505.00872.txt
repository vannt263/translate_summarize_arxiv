    "the outbreak of ebola virus disease ( evd ) in west africa 2014 revealed many challenges in predicting and controlling the spread of infectious diseases .",
    "these challenges are partly related to the mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the epidemic . providing accurate predictions appeared to be extremely difficult .    to address these challenges , several new models",
    "have been suggested each providing quite different results , for example @xcite .",
    "we also note that different aspects of possible control have been intensively studied in the literature including distribution strategies for vaccination and antibiotic programs @xcite as well as travel restrictions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the development of models that are well suited to the control of an outbreak .",
    "the most commonly studied models in this area deal with temporal networks @xcite where several different models have been suggested .    in @xcite the 1995 ebola outbreak in congo",
    "is considered using an seir model whereby control intervention , performed at time @xmath0 is described by the transmission coefficient @xmath1 defined by @xmath2 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the initial transmission rate that would remain stable without the intervention .",
    "our paper models and studies an alternative control mechanism to decrease in the transmission of infection based on the model developed in @xcite where the transmission of infection depends mainly on two parameters : the transmission rate @xmath6 and the average time of isolation @xmath7 in contrast to @xcite we assume that the transmission rate @xmath6 does not change over the whole period under consideration .",
    "the main dynamic parameter in our model is @xmath8 and all the intervention measures are directed at decreasing @xmath8 and consequently reducing the spread of infection .",
    "the average time to hospitalization can be used for the average time of isolation @xmath9 although the isolation of infectious population is not exactly the same as  hospitalization \" .",
    "clearly , as the disease progresses hospitals become short on beds ( as well as staff and supplies ) required to isolate and treat all newly infected individuals . as a result",
    ", the number of infected population can grow exponentially .",
    "this was the case for the ebola virus epidemic in west africa ( guinea , sierra leone and liberia ) where the spread of infection was highly dangerous during june - november 2014 when the capacity for treating ebola patients was insufficient .",
    "it was reported @xcite that during this period  ... many clinics and hospitals in all three of the countries worst hit by ebola have effectively been shut down \" .",
    "after rapidly building new infrastructure and increasing the capacity of beds the outbreak slowed down significantly . starting from january 2015 , the epidemic has moved to the ending phase that involves ensuring  capacity for case finding , case management , safe burials and community engagement \" ( @xcite - who , ebola situation report , 28 jan 2015 ) .",
    "note that in @xcite the hospitalization rate was the parameter showing the greatest change .    addressing these issues",
    ", this paper suggests new mathematical models that can be used to increase the efficiency of available resources .",
    "the main goal here is to keep the model as simple as possible and , at the same time , to have measurable control variables .",
    "note that there are many useful control measures that have been intensively studied by introducing more ",
    "detailed \" mathematical models , however such models have less predictive capabilities ( due to overfitting ) .",
    "prediction is crucial when considering future planning periods .",
    "the main component in the suggested model is the optimal distribution of bed capabilities across countries / regions .",
    "this is a very important and difficult problem that requires an accurate prediction of the dynamics of infected population in each region . for example , evaluating the situation of the ebola outbreak , who s ebola situation report on 14 jan 2015 @xcite notes that  each of the intense - transmission countries has sufficient capacity to isolate and treat patients , with more than 2 treatment beds per reported confirmed and probable case .",
    "however , the uneven geographical distribution of beds and cases , and the under - reporting of cases , means that not all evd cases are isolated in several areas . \"",
    "in @xcite a new model is introduced to study the dynamics of epidemics by considering the average time for isolation ( denoted by @xmath8 ) of infectious population as a time - dependent parameter .",
    "this model is derived from the well studied @xmath10 ( susceptible - infectious - recovery ) model ( e.g. @xcite ) and is similar to models based on transmission rates from infectious population at different generations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the use of time - dependent parameter @xmath8 enables the analysis of future scenarios by considering possible changes in @xmath7 in this paper we extend this approach by developing practical and efficient optimal control models .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the number of infected cases at @xmath12 ( in days ) . assuming that the natural death rate of population ( @xmath13 ) is zero , the equation for @xmath11 is as follows ( see @xcite for more details ) @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the death rate due to disease ; @xmath16 is the average latent period ( in days ) for infected individuals to become infectious ;",
    "@xmath8 is the average infectiousness period ( in days ) ; it is the average time required for isolation ( time to hospitalization ) ; and @xmath6 is the transmission rate .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is a gamma ( cumulative ) distribution function ( with p.d.f - @xmath18 ) for deaths due to disease .",
    "the fraction @xmath19 in this case represents the proportion of remaining infected cases @xmath20 after @xmath21 days .",
    "the sum @xmath22 defines the number of `` active '' infectious population at time @xmath23 it represents the number of infectious population that are not yet isolated and therefore it is the only source of secondary infections .",
    "( for the sake of simplicity we do not consider infections in hospitals and death ceremonies ) .",
    "then by setting @xmath24 we obtain model ( 1 ) in @xcite where @xmath13 ( the natural death rate ) in our case is zero .",
    "the basic reproduction number @xmath25 is calculated by considering the stationary states in ( [ x ] ) : @xmath26.\\ ] ]    there are three main parameters in ( [ x ] ) - @xmath27 and @xmath7 the results obtained in @xcite show that this model provides quite good approximation to the total number infected cases and deaths during the current ebola epidemic if @xmath8 is a piecewise constant function ( in fact , constant over consequent subintervals with durations 2 - 3 months ) and the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath6 are constant over the whole period .",
    "these results help us to predict the dynamics of an infected population at future time intervals by keeping the values of @xmath15 and @xmath6 unchanged ( estimated from the previous period ) and considering different possible changes in @xmath7 in this case the major strategy of preventive intervention is the achievement of some decrease in @xmath8 that according to ( [ r ] ) is equivalent to decreasing the effective reproduction number .",
    "this approach is implemented below by introducing an optimal control models where the average time to hospitalization @xmath8 is the key variable . according to the results of data fitting mentioned above , it is sufficient to let @xmath8 be constant on quite long time intervals ( months )",
    ". + * control @xmath28 .  *",
    "therefore , we define @xmath29 as a control variable by assuming that it is piece - wise constant with integer values ( days ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    "let @xmath30 , ~ j = 1 , 2 , \\cdots , p.\\ ] ] it is reasonable to assume that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the minimal number of days required to isolate infectious population .",
    "+ * trajectory @xmath33 .  *",
    "given control @xmath28 we define trajectory @xmath34 as follows    @xmath35    in this formula the sum @xmath36 represents the number of infectious individuals that are not yet isolated . considering the average length of hospital stay ( in days )",
    ", the number of hospitalized cases at @xmath37 can be calculated as @xmath38 note that , recent studies ( see for example @xcite ) show that @xmath39 is around 6.5 days .",
    "in this section we provide some numerical experiments based on data from guinea , sierra - leon and liberia .",
    "we consider the cumulative number of infectious cases and deaths denoted by @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "they can be calculated as        here @xmath44 is the death rate of infectious population in generation @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a large number .",
    "parameters of the gamma distribution function @xmath47 are taken from @xcite where @xmath48 with mean value 7.5 .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath49 and @xmath50 as in @xcite .    in the considered model ( [ xrt ] )",
    "there are only three parameters @xmath15 and @xmath6 ( constants ) and a piece - wise constant control function @xmath29 that need to be optimized to fit data - the total number of infectious population and deaths . the aim here is to show that there exists a control @xmath29 such that the corresponding trajectory @xmath11 fits data well . + we consider three consequent intervals @xmath51 $ ] @xmath52 for each country and find optimal values @xmath53 @xmath6 and @xmath54 @xmath52 where @xmath55 the results are presented in table [ table_r_k ] .",
