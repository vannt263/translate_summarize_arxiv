    "alice published recently the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 of inclusive j/@xmath0 down to zero @xmath2 at forward rapidity in pb - pb collisions at @xmath4 = 2.76 tev @xcite .",
    "j/@xmath0 are found to be less suppressed in central collisions with respect to sps @xcite and rhic @xcite measurements .",
    "statistical hadronization @xcite and transport models @xcite , assuming j/@xmath0 regeneration from @xmath5 pairs , are able to reproduce alice data .",
    "the study of other observables , such as the azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles , brings additional information on how these particles are produced . in semi - central heavy - ion collisions , the distribution of the colliding matter is anisotropic in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction . if the matter is interacting , this spatial asymmetry is transferred to the momentum distribution of produced particles .",
    "the second moment of the final state hadron angular distribution is called the elliptic flow ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the measurement of the j/@xmath0 elliptic flow is particularly interesting to learn about the interaction mechanisms within the qgp .",
    "primordial j/@xmath0 produced by hard processes at the early stage of the collision are expected to be insensitive to collective phenomena . on the contrary ,",
    "j/@xmath0 produced by recombination of charmed quark pairs in a deconfined phase should inherit the flow of charmed quarks , and consequently we expect to measure a non - zero elliptic flow .",

    "j/@xmath0 @xmath1 is found to be consistent with zero in all of the measured @xmath2 range within uncertainties . in this proceeding",
    ", we report on the first measurement of the inclusive j/@xmath0 @xmath1 performed with the alice detector , in pb - pb collisions at @xmath6 = 2.76 tev in the @xmath2 range 0 - 10 gev / c and rapidity range @xmath7 .",
    "the j/@xmath0 is studied via its dimuon decay channel .",
    "the evolution of the j/@xmath0 @xmath1 with centrality and @xmath2 is presented .",
    "the alice detector is decribed in @xcite .",
    "the relevant detectors for this analysis are the muon spectrometer , the vzero scintillators , the first two layers ( spd ) of the inner tracking system ( its ) , and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the muon forward spectrometer covers the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath8 and consists of a front hadron absorber ( 10@xmath9 ) , five tracking stations composed of two planes of cathode pad chambers ( cpc ) each , a dipole magnet , an iron wall for filtering secondary and punch - through hadrons , and two triggering stations composed of two planes of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) each .",
    "it allows the quarkonia measurement down to zero @xmath2 .",
    "the vzero detector is made of two scintillator arrays ( 32 scintillators each ) located on both sides of the interaction point and covering pseudo - rapidity regions @xmath10 ( vzero - c ) and @xmath11 ( vzero - a ) .",
    "each array is divided into 4 rings of 8 scintillators .",
    "the vzero - c detector shares part of the muon spectrometer acceptance , therefore only the vzero - a is used to determine the event plane to avoid auto - correlations .",
    "the vzero detector is also used for the determination of the centrality of the collision .",
    "the spd consists of two layers covering @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "it is used for triggering and to determine the vertex position of the pb - pb interaction .",
    "the tpc is used to determine the event plane resolution of the vzero - a .",
    "the minimum bias trigger condition in alice requires a signal in two readout chips in the outer layer of spd , a signal in vzero - a and a signal in vzero - c .",
    "this trigger is downscaled to a rate of 10 hz and the data sample collected amounts to an integrated luminosity of about 1 @xmath14 .",
    "events collected with this trigger are used for the flattening of the vzero - a event plane angle distribution .",
    "complementary to the minimum bias trigger , a dimuon trigger is used .",
    "the dimuon trigger condition consists of the minimum bias trigger conditions in addition to the requirement of the detection of 2 tracks passing the low @xmath2 cut given by the trigger on - line algorithm ( 50@xmath15 efficiency for 1 gev / c @xmath2 tracks ) . in this analysis",
    ", the total integrated luminosity corresponds to 70 @xmath14 .",
    "the j/@xmath0 elliptic flow was extracted using the event plane method . in this method , the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane is estimated from the observed event plane angle determined from the anisotropic flow itself .",
    "the event flow vector is defined as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean azimuthal angle of each scintillator of vzero - a and @xmath18 is a weight proportional to the flux of particles crossing those scintillators .",
    "the event plane angle for the @xmath19 harmonic is then expressed as : @xmath20 in order to correct for detector non - uniformities , a flattening procedure of the event plane azimuthal distribution is applied in two steps .",
    "the first step of the flattening procedure is described in @xcite .",
    "the second step uses a fourier flattening technique @xcite and removes part of the residual effects due to the azimuthal segmentation of vzero rings .",
    "a cut on the @xmath21 coordinate ( direction along the beam axis ) is also applied ( @xmath22 10 cm ) in order to improve the flattening performances .",
    "the following selection criteria are applied to the muons : both muon tracks reconstructed in the muon tracker should match a tracklet in the muon trigger stations and both muon tracks should exit the hadron absorber within the acceptance of the muon spectrometer .",
    "opposite sign dimuons in the rapidity range @xmath7 are then selected . for each @xmath2 and centrality bin the event sample",
    "is divided into 6 @xmath23 bins , with @xmath24 and the corresponding dimuon invariant mass spectra are fitted to extract the @xmath25 signal . in order to address the systematic uncertainties coming from the signal extraction ,",
