    "a diffusion process whose lifetime is almost surely infinite is said to be _ stochastically complete _ ( or _ conservative _ or _ non - explosive _ ) .",
    "if this fails to occur , that is , if the total probability of the particle undergoing the diffusion to be in the state space is less than one at some time , the process is said to be _ stochastically incomplete_. a trivial way for stochastic incompleteness to occur is to impose a killing boundary condition .",
    "it is the objective of this article to survey the geometric properties , in the case when no such killing condition is present , that cause stochastic incompleteness to occur for the minimal diffusion process associated to the laplacian on manifolds and graphs .",
    "we draw heavily from the survey article of a. grigoryan @xcite for the case of riemannian manifolds and then present some recent results for graphs .",
    "examples of geodesically complete but stochastically incomplete manifolds were first given by r. azencott @xcite .",
    "specifically , if @xmath0 is a geodesically complete , simply connected , negatively curved , analytic riemannian manifold and @xmath1 denotes the smallest , in absolute value , sectional curvature at distance @xmath2 , then azencott showed that @xmath0 is stochastically incomplete if @xmath3 for @xmath4 @xcite*proposition 7.9 . in these examples ,",

    "yau showed that a geodesically complete manifold whose ricci curvature is bounded from below is stochastically complete @xcite .",
    "a different type of criterion for stochastic completeness in terms of the volume growth was given by grigoryan in 1986 .",
    "in particular , grigoryan s result implies that , if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the volume of a geodesic ball of radius @xmath2 , then a geodesically complete manifold is stochastically complete @xcite .",
    "the examples of azencott , or the case of model manifolds , show that grigoryan s criterion is sharp .",
    "the corresponding question for graphs was explicitly addressed by j. dodziuk and v. mathai in 2006 . by analyzing bounded solutions of the heat equation",
    ", they show that graphs of bounded valence are stochastically complete @xcite*theorem 2.10 .",
    "examples of a stochastically incomplete graph were given in @xcite .",
    "these examples are trees branching rapidly in all directions from a fixed vertex . more specifically , letting @xmath7 denote the minimum number of outward pointing edges , where the minimum is taken over all vertices on a sphere of radius @xmath2 in a tree ,",
    "then the diffusion is stochastically incomplete if @xmath8 @xcite*theorem 3.4 .",
    "therefore , in the case of graphs , the number of outward pointing edges plays the role of the negative sectional curvature in sweeping the particle out to infinity .",
    "the volume growth for such trees is factorial and , while smaller , at least comparable to the examples of azencott . in this article",
    ", we give many more examples of stochastically incomplete graphs .",
    "in particular , in theorem [ sgraphs ] , we completely characterize the stochastic incompleteness of spherically symmetric graphs and use this to give examples of stochastically incomplete graphs with only polynomial volume growth .",
    "thus , in the case of graphs , no direct analogue of grigoryan s theorem holds .",
    "in this section we give an overview of properties equivalent to stochastic incompleteness . here , the manifold and graph settings are quite analogous so we do not distinguish between the two . to avoid trivial examples ,",

    ", one has a laplacian acting on a dense subset of the space of @xmath9 functions .",
    "we choose our sign convention so that the laplacian is a positive operator .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath10 , we take @xmath11 , while , for graphs , if @xmath12 is a function on the vertices , then , pointwise , the laplacian acts by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 indicates that the vertices @xmath15 and @xmath16 form an edge . we note that this sign convention is consistent with the one followed in @xcite but opposite of @xcite .    in both cases , the laplacian is essentially self - adjoint and one uses the functional calculus to define a semigroup of operators @xmath17 .",
    "the action of the semigroup is given by a kernel @xmath18 , henceforth called the _ heat kernel _ , so that , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a continuous , bounded function .",
    "alternatively , the heat kernel can be constructed by an exhaustion argument . in this construction , one takes a sequence of increasing subsets of the whole space , defines the heat kernel with dirichlet boundary conditions for each subset in the exhaustion , and then passes to the limit .",
    "this is the approach taken in the case of manifolds in @xcite and for graphs in @xcite and the equivalence of the two constructions is demonstrated there .",
    "the heat kernel is positive , symmetric , satisfies the semigroup property and has total integral less than or equal to 1 . in particular",
    ", @xmath18 gives the transition density for a diffusion process on the underlying space , referred to as the _ minimal diffusion process associated to the laplacian _",

    "the following theorem gives some equivalent formulations of stochastic incompleteness .",

    "for example , take @xmath120 with @xmath229 so that @xmath120 is stochastically incomplete with @xmath230 .",
    "now , connect each vertex @xmath223 to every other vertex in @xmath72 to obtain @xmath220 .",
    "then , at @xmath231 , @xmath232 , while @xmath233 so , probabilistically , the particle is much more likely to remain on the sphere @xmath72 than go outwards .",
    "on the other hand , theorem [ doubletrees ] shows that adding only @xmath234 end vertices at @xmath15 does have the effect of trapping the particle .",
    "this contrast can be understood in light of the following model for the diffusion process governed by the heat kernel .",
    "the direction of each jump is chosen randomly with probabilities as in the case of the simple random walk on the graph ; however , the holding time of the particle at a vertex is a random variable whose exponential distribution depends on the valence of the vertex . specifically , if the particle undergoing the diffusion is at a vertex @xmath15 at time @xmath235 , then it will jump , after a random time , to one of the neighbors of @xmath15 with probability @xmath236 . furthermore , the probability that it has not moved from the vertex @xmath15 at time @xmath237 is @xmath238 .",
    "see @xcite for more details on this model of the diffusion process .",
    "therefore , in the example above , although the particle will most likely jump to another vertex on the same sphere , the factorial valence at that vertex implies that the particle will not remain there for long . in the case of adding end vertices , the holding time of the particle at a vertex of valence one",
    "is expected to be longer then at a vertex of high valency and this explains why , in this case , the particle is slowed down and explosion is prevented .",
    "[ sphericalgraphs ] let @xmath71 be given with @xmath239 .",
    "we then connect every vertex in @xmath72 to every vertex in @xmath240 for all @xmath113 .",
    "such graphs are spherically symmetric with @xmath241 and @xmath242 and we denote them by @xmath243 . theorem [ sgraphs ] then implies that @xmath243 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath244    this allows us to create many examples of stochastically incomplete graphs with polynomial volume growth . for example , letting @xmath245 then , by ( [ spheregraphs ] ) , @xmath243 is stochastically incomplete with @xmath246 moreover , these examples show that the condition @xmath8 which is sufficient for the stochastic incompleteness of trees is not , in general , sufficient by considering the case of @xmath247 which is complete .",
    "furthermore , given any graph , not necessarily spherically symmetric , whose spheres satisfy ( [ spheregraphs ] ) for some vertex @xmath69 , one can create a spherically symmetric stochastically incomplete graph by connecting all vertices in @xmath72 to all vertices in @xmath240 for @xmath248 .",
    "this operation , where we add edges but do not change the vertex set to obtain a stochastically incomplete graph from a complete one , is complementary to the procedure described in section [ subgraphs section ] , where we added vertices and edges to create a complete graph from an incomplete one . on the other hand , in example [ modelgraphsex ]",
    "we discussed how adding edges along the same sphere has no effect on stochastic completeness .",
    "one can also extend our techniques to the case of the weighted laplacian as found in @xcite and , as a special case , in @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the weighted graph @xmath249 with vertex set @xmath250 , edge set @xmath251 , and edge weights @xmath252 .",
    "consider a function @xmath29 on the vertices of @xmath249 satisfying @xmath253 for @xmath254 where @xmath83 denotes the weighted laplacian .",
    "it follows that @xmath255 and one shows by induction that @xmath256 therefore , estimating as in theorem [ sgraphs ] , we have that @xmath29 will be bounded if and only if @xmath257 which is a special case of theorem [ sgraphs ] where @xmath258 and @xmath259",
    "we have shown that , with respect to volume growth , stochastically incomplete manifolds and graphs exhibit quite different behavior .",
    "however , we still believe that a general criterion for stochastic completeness of graphs in terms of volume growth , in analogy to grigoryan s result , should exist . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned previously , in @xcite , it is shown that the criterion for stochastic completeness of model manifolds , that is , @xmath260 , does not imply stochastic completeness of general manifolds .",
    "furthermore , it is also shown in @xcite that @xmath226 does not , in general , imply stochastic incompleteness .",
    "we are already in a position to prove the analogous statements for graphs .",
    "first , we show that the condition @xmath261 does not imply stochastic completeness . for this ,",
    "take @xmath243 with @xmath245 in example [ sphericalgraphs ] .",
    "this example is stochastically incomplete but @xmath262 for @xmath2 large .    to show that @xmath263 does not imply stochastic incompleteness , consider example [ completionex ] where we take @xmath144 with @xmath171 and @xmath234 . by theorem [ doubletrees ] , this example is stochastically complete .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath6 denote the area of the sphere and volume of the ball in @xmath120 while @xmath264 and @xmath265 denote the corresponding quantities in @xmath144 . then @xmath266 and @xmath73 and , from theorem [ sgraphs ] , we know that @xmath267 on , @xmath144 we have that @xmath268 where we set @xmath269",
    ". therefore , @xmath270 and we have that @xmath271      there is a well - known discretization procedure originating in the works of m. kanai in which a graph is associated to a riemannian manifold in such a way that many properties of the graph reflect those of the manifold @xcite .",
    "this procedure is used to show that certain properties of manifolds are preserved by rough isometries .",
    "for example , in @xcite*theorem 1 , kanai shows that rough isometries preserve the property of a manifold to be parabolic .",
    "the proof uses a graph to approximate the manifold , shows that parabolicity is preserved during the discretization , and then shows that rough isometries preserve the parabolicity of graphs .",
    "the same technique is used in @xcite to show that volume growth is preserved by rough isometries .",
    "however , a crucial assumption in kanai s construction is that the manifolds and graphs have _ bounded geometry_. for manifolds , this means , in particular , that the ricci curvature is bounded from below and for graphs this means that the valence is uniformly bounded from above . as we have mentioned , these assumptions automatically imply that the spaces in question are stochastically complete and kanai s discretization scheme does not apply in our case . in particular ,",
    "in example [ completionex ] the graphs @xmath120 and @xmath144 are roughly isometric but @xmath120 is stochastically incomplete while @xmath144 is stochastically complete .",
    "as mentioned previously , grigoryan s volume criterion ( [ gri ] ) was extended to the more general setting of dirichlet spaces by sturm @xcite .",
    "in particular , _ metric _ or _ quantum _ graphs are covered by this extension .",
    "therefore , we have shown that , with respect to volume growth , solutions of the heat equation behave differently on quantum and discrete graphs .",
    "this is also the case for solutions of the wave equation where , in the quantum setting , as on manifolds , solutions of the wave equation have finite propagation speed , in contrast to the case of discrete graphs .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "i would like to thank many people with whom i ve had helpful and inspiring discussions while working on the material in this article .",
    "in particular , i would like to thank jzef dodziuk , pedro freitas , sebastian haeseler , matthias keller , daniel lenz , erin pearse , florian sobieczky , and jean - claude zambrini ."
