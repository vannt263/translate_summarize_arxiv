    "we have been investigating the physical and chemical characteristics of some merger seyfert galaxies on the basis of the observed spectra in the optical and infrared ( ir ) ranges ( ngc 7212 , contini et al 2012 , ngc 3393 , contini , 2012a , ngc 6240 , contini 2012b ) , with the aim of explaining the physical and chemical conditions of gas and dust , and looking for some records of the parent galaxy collision .",
    "we could find that collision records appear throughout the extended narrow line region ( enlr ) as isolated patches of matter in abnormal conditions , such as high velocities , high densities and relatively high ionization - level lines .",
    "an important question about mergers is whether starbursts or agns are the radiation sources ( e.g. gonzales - alfonso et al 2004 ) .",
    "we have analysed the spectra observed from the merger galaxies by models which account for the photoionizing flux from the agn and from the starburst coupled with a shock wave hydrodynamic regime , which is suitable to the collisional characteristic of merging .",
    "we have found that generally , the optical line spectra are better reproduced by the agn , while the ir line ratios are explained by the starburst .",
    "the modelling of the spectra showed in particular that very young stars , such as wolf - rayet , are present in the centre of ngc 3393 whereas strong absorption from the galaxy prevents to see them throughout the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the continuum .",
    "the relative abundances of the heavy elements are an important issue in mergers because they reveal whether primordial matter was trapped at the time of collision .",
    "we have found lower than solar metallicities in ngc 7212 and in ngc 3393 ( except the high n / h which derives from the wolf - rayet wind ) . in ngc 6240 , the c ,",
    "n , o and ar abundances relative to h appear higher than solar by a factor @xmath1 , because h is trapped into h@xmath2 molecules and therefore depleted from the gaseous phase .",
    "on the other hand s / h , si / h and fe / h show lower than solar abundances characteristic of the ism included in the nlr during the merging process .",
    "actually the high shock velocities exclude the hypothesis of trapping into grains due to sputtering .    in the present paper",
    "we will investigate arp 220 ( z=0.018 ) , which is an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) with @xmath3 10@xmath4 , at a distance of 72 mpc ( graham et al 1990 ) .",
    "the merger can be seen in graham et al ( 1990 ) observations .",
    "the image at 2.2 shows two resolved sources separated by a distance of 350 pc .",
    "the merging of two galaxies was revealed also by the disturbed morphology and the tidal tails .",
    "graham et al discuss the distance of the nuclei and the age of the merger considering the starburst , the agn , dust and gas .",
    "taniguchi et al ( 2012 ) on the basis of the two tidal tails , suggest a multiple merging system for arp 220 , composed of four or more galaxies arising from a compact group of galaxies .",
    "the two compact radio peaks associated with the ir nuclei reveal that they are radio sources and not radio jets .",
    "molecular gas and massive young stars might contribute by @xmath0 10% to the luminosity ( sturm et al .",
    "1996 ) of arp 220 .",
    "a hidden agn similar to a liner ( rieke et al 1985 ) is revealed by the broad br@xmath5 line ( fwhm @xmath0 1300 , depoy et al .",
    "rangwala et al .",
    "( 2011 ) on the basis of observations by @xmath6 claim that the large column densities observed for molecular ions strongly favour the existence of an x - ray luminous agn ( 10@xmath7 s@xmath8 ) .",
    "wilson et al ( 2006 ) found more than 206 centrally concentrated clusters which can be classified into two groups : young and intermediate -age population of 10 and 300 myr , respectively .",
    "armus et al ( 1989 ) analysing the optical line fluxes for a sample of powerful far - infrared galaxies including arp 220 , claim that a young stellar population is present in all of them .    by modelling the spectra of arp 220 , we would like to add some information about mergers in general and arp 220 in particular .",
    "we will carry on the investigation of the physical conditions and the abundances of the heavy elements throughout the nlr of close seyfert galaxies which show merging , as was done for e.g. ngc 7212 and for ngc 3393 and ngc 6240 that show a double nucleus .",
    "most observations of arp 220 report on molecular bands , we will focus instead on the lines emitted and absorbed by the gas consistently with the continua emitted and absorbed by gas and dust",
    ". we will adopt models which account for photoionization by the agn or by the starburst coupled to the shock hydrodynamics , which were assembled to investigate the nlr of agn and the starburst galaxy environments ( e.g. viegas & contini 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the nucleus of arp 220 is heavily obscured ( smith et al 1989 ) .",
    "the depth of the 10 silicate band is only a lower limit .",
    "the observations of the continuum in the submillimeter have shown that the emission is optically thick even at wavelenths longer than 100 ( emerson et al 1984 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that extinction can reach av=1000 mag .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of arp 220 indicates an active nucleus or plural active nuclei heavily obscured . in agreement with the other mergers ,",
    "arp 220 has most probably a central starburst of young stars .",
    "we will check these prediction by modelling the spectra in the different frequency ranges .",
    "the observed optical line spectra ( veilleux et al . 1999 ) are not rich in number of lines , in particular , the very significant [ oii]3727 + 3729 doublet is lacking .",
    "so we will constrain the models recalling the spectra emitted by ngc 6240 , another merger galaxy at low redshift with characteristics similar to arp 220 . on the other hand ,",
    "the continuum sed of arp 220 is very well defined by a rich collection of observational data .",
    "the modelling of the line spectra must be consistent with the sed of the continuum , even if modelling the sed is less constraining ( see contini , 2012b ) .",
    "previous models of arp 220 sed were presented by contini et al ( 2004 ) and by contini & contini ( 2007 ) on the basis of the data from the ned .",
    "the data were well reproduced in all the observed frequency ranges by a composite model accounting for the flux from the agn and shocks ( contini et al 2004 ) and composite models of agn and starburst and shocks ( contini & contini 2007 ) . since then",
    ", the data from the ned were enriched and updated . today",
    ", they better delineate the main physical mechanisms at the basis of the arp 220 sed , namely bremsstrahlung from the gas , and reprocessed radiation from dust .",
    "yet , only the line spectra will decide whether a power - law radiation from the agn or the black - body radiation from the starburst characterises the photoionization source .",
    "the modelling process is described in sect .",
    "the comparison of the calculated line ratios with the data appears in sect .",
    "dust and gas continuum seds are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "4 . concluding remarks follow in sect .",
    "in the optical range we will refer to the spectrum observed by veilleux et al .",
    "the spectroscopic data for arp 220 are presented within the sample of iras 1 jy sample of ulirgs .",
    "they were observed by the gold cam spectrograph on the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope .    in the ir we will model the spectrum reported by sturm et al ( 1996 ) that was obtained with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board iso .",
    "the data are constrained by the observations of 10 - 37 spectra of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) by farrah et al ( 2007 ) taken using the infrared spectrograph on board of _",
    "spitzer_. in particular , sturm et al do not detect high excitation fine structure lines of [ oiv ] , [ nev ] and [ nevi ] in arp 220 , suggesting that such lines are emitted from gas photoionised by a much harder radiation than that emitted by the starburst , or heated by a relatively strong shock .",
    "however their conclusion derives from diagnostic diagrams , namely , the [ neii ] line limits are below the ranges observed by iso in agns .",
    "sturm et al claim that although a low luminosity agn could be present , star formation are the dominant source of radiation in arp 220 .",
    "in fact ir lines are generally emitted from gas photoionised by massive star formed in a recent starburst .",

    "the line and continuum spectra are calculated by the code sumamarcel / suma / index.htm ] which simulates the physical conditions of an emitting gaseous nebula under the coupled effect of photoionization from an external source and shocks .",
    "the calculations are described in detail by viegas & contini ( 1994 and references therein ) and contini et al .",
    "( 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "the input parameters which characterise the model are : the shock velocity , the atomic preshock density 0 , the preshock magnetic field 0 .",
    "they define the hydrodynamical field and are used in the calculations of the rankine - hugoniot equations at the shock front and downstream .",
    "these equations are combined into the compression equation which is resolved throughout each slab of the gas , in order to obtain the density profile downstream and consequently , the temperature .",
    "we adopt for all the models 0=10@xmath15 gauss .",
    "in fact , a higher preshock density is compensated by a higher magnetic field which reduces compression and viceversa .",
    "we do not have enough data throughout the arp 220 enlr to avoid degeneration of models choosing between 0 and 0 effects on the density ( see contini 2009 ) .",
    "the input parameter that represents the radiation field is the power - law flux from the active center @xmath16 in number of photons @xmath17 s@xmath8 ev@xmath8 at the lyman limit , if the photoionization source is an active nucleus .",

    "if the radiation flux is black body radiation from the stars , the input parameters are the colour temperature of the star and the ionization parameter @xmath20 ( in number of photons per number of electrons at the nebula ) .",
    "the secondary diffuse radiation emitted from the slabs of gas heated by the shocks is also calculated .",
    "the flux from the active centre , from the stars and the secondary radiation are calculated by radiation transfer throughout the slabs downstream .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the emitting nebula @xmath25 , the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath26 , and the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , a , and fe relative to h are also accounted for .",
    "the distribution of the grain radius downstream is determined by sputtering , beginning with an initial radius of @xmath0 0.5 - 2.5 .    in our models",
    "the flux from an external source can reach the shock front ( the inflow case , indicated by the parameter @xmath27=0 ) or the edge of the cloud opposite to the shock front when the cloud propagates outwards from the ac or from the starburst ( outflow , indicated by @xmath27=1 ) .",
    "the fractional abundances of the ions are calculated resolving the ionization equations considering ionization by the primary flux , the secondary flux and collisional ionization in each slab downstream .",
    "the line intensity calculated in each slab depends strongly on the density , temperature , and radiation from both the sides of the cloud .",
    "the line intensities are integrated throughout the downstream region up to a distance @xmath25 from the shock front at which the gas has reached a relatively low temperature ( t@xmath28 10@xmath11 k ) in the case of inflow ( radiation bound case ) or to a distance @xmath25 such that all the calculated line ratios reproduce the observed ones ( matter bound case ) . in the outflow case",

    "the ages of the galaxies are given in the bottom of table 3 .",
    "the models which appear in table 3 , column 3 , are characterised by the nature of the radiation flux , namely a power - law ( pl ) , black body ( bb ) , and shock dominated ( sd ) which indicates that @xmath16=0 or @xmath20=0 .",
    "although the line spectra of arp 220 in the different frequency ranges are given by single observations covering all the different regions within the extended nlr , we can at least try to find the location of the clouds in the surroundings of the agn and of the starburst .",
    "first notice that the clouds emitting the spectra show similar shock velocities and preshock densities .",
    "the preshock densities are similar to those calculated in the milky way ism .",
    "the optical spectra observed from arp 220 come from clouds reached by the agn radiation flux , while the ir spectra are emitted from clouds close to the starburst .",
    "it seems that the strong obscuration in the galaxy central region is fragmented such as to allow to observe the optical spectrum from the nlr of the agn .",
    "the distance r of the emitting gas from the starburst and from the agn , can be calculated combining the observed absolute flux observed at earth with the absolute flux calculated at the nebula f@xmath30 ( obs ) d@xmath31 = f@xmath30 ( calc ) r@xmath31 @xmath32 , where d is the distance from earth and @xmath32 can be regarded as the filling factor . for arp",

    "the results show that the clouds emitting the mid - ir and the far - ir lines , e.g. [ neii]12.8 and [ cii]157 , respectively , are at a distance r@xmath33}$]=2.96 kpc and r@xmath34}$]=5.64 kpc from the starburst , adopting @xmath32=1 . in ngc 6240 the starburst fills the central kpc region encompassing the two nuclei ( engel et al .",
    "if the 4.5 10@xmath35 k stars embody the central starburst of arp 220 , the clouds emitting the ir and fir lines are close to it , therefore they are highly obscured in the optical range .",
    "we have shown in sect . 3.3",
    "that the [ oi]63 , 145 and [ ci ] at 492 and 809 ghz lines are formed in the internal region of extended clouds and are therefore absorbed , while [ cii ] lines are emitted from the external edges .",
    "this confirms that the clouds are moving outwards .",
    "in fact , the temperatures on the edge of the cloud facing the radiation source reach a maximum of 2 - 3 10@xmath35 k because the gas is heated by radiation . on the opposite edge ,",
    "the gas is heated collisionally by the shock at temperatures which depend on . figs . 1 and 2 show that the temperatures on the shock front are @xmath0 10@xmath36 k yielding to highly ionized gas .",
    "such temperatures are certainly higher than those corresponding to the first ionization level lines . on the contrary , in the inflowing case ,",
    "radiation from the external ionizing source would reach the clouds on the shock front , where collisional ionization dominates .",
    "consequently the [ cii ] line emission will be restricted to a small region in the internal region of the clouds .",
    "r@xmath37=1.51 kpc is the distance from the active centre of the optical emitting clouds , adopting @xmath32=0.01 ( sect .",
    "the optical emission comes from the extended nlr of the agn , where the extinction is relatively low .",
    "the o / h ratio is lower than solar by a factor of @xmath0 2 and s / h by a small factor of 1.4 .",
    "we suggest that such low abundances are characteristic of matter included in the merger during the parent collision .",
    "the high velocity clouds are located at a distance of 66 kpc from the active centre .",
    "the relative abundances ( table 3 ) calculated for the arp 220 starburst show that o / h are higher than solar , while si /h and",
    "s / h highly depleted , indicating inclusions into dust grains throughout the starburst region .",
    "a high dust - to - gas ratio is found by modelling the dust reprocessed radiation bump by the model which represents the clouds photoionised by the starburst .",
    "this could explain also the strong absorption of the synchrotron radiation created by the fermi mechanism at the shock front which characterizes the arp 220 radio sed .",
    "only the radio thermal bremsstrahlung is seen in the continuum sed .",
    "we have found that the dust reprocessed radiation bump in the ir is well reproduced by relatively large grains ( = 1 ) accompanying the gas throughout the shock front and downstream for = 1000 .",
    "grains with = 0.3 are adopted in the model which represents clouds close to the starburst .",
    "they also yield a satisfactory fit of the ir bump but do not cover the x - ray domain . grain growth up to cm - sized particles are predicted by ubach et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "so grains of @xmath0 1 size entering the shock front could be the product of former larger grain fragmentation .",
    "we compare now the results of the physical conditions and of the relative abundances of the heavy elements , obtained for arp 220 in previous sections with the results obtained by modelling other merger galaxies .",
    "two agns were observed in the x - ray in ngc 3393 ( fabbiano et al 2011 ) and in ngc 6240 ( komossa et al 2003 ) . in ngc 7212",
    "the merging is confirmed by patches of gas emitting broad line profiles at the edges of the enlr ( cracco et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "table 3 shows that the shock velocities are similar to those generally found in the nlr of agn ( 100 - 1000 ) .",
    "however , it is important for mergers to investigate the distribution of throughout the nlr in order to find out eventual collision records .",
    "the shock velocities are between 300 and 1000 , except for ngc 3393 and ngc 7212 where regions of low velocity survived to the galaxy collision throughout most of the nlr .",
    "the relatively high observed in some central regions and at the outer limits of the extended nlr shows residuals of collision .",
    "the shocked matter seems present throughout most of the ngc 3393 nlr , not only because of the high but because of the unexpectedly high 0 close to the agn . in the other galaxies presented in table 3",
    ", the preshock densities range from 30 - 40 - 120 3 in ngc 6240 , arp 220 and ngc 7212 , respectively .",
    "a starburst was found in the centre of the merger galaxies , except in ngc 7212 where the eventual double agn and the central starburst is not yet observed .",
    "relative abundances ( table 4 ) show generally a higher than solar n / h , by a factor of @xmath01.5 . except for ngc 7212 showing n / h depletion in most of the observed regions .",
    "in particular arp 220 shows n / o @xmath0 0.2 - 0.4 , higher than the solar value n / o=0.15 ( allen 1976 ) and n / o=0.12 ( anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "this result can be explained following contini et al ( 2002b ) , namely the galaxy ism can be enriched in nitrogen but not in oxygen during a long period of quiescence of intermediate - mass star evolution .",
    "the results obtained by modelling the arp 220 line and continuum spectra are only a hint to the real picture of the physical conditions throughout the galaxy .",
    "there is an urgent need of integral spectroscopy in order to have more information about the distribution of the physical and chemical quantities .",

    "<S> the line and continuum spectra of the merger galaxy arp 220 are analysed with the aim of investigating the ionizing and heating sources . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to radio , optical , infrared and x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that in agreement with other merger galaxies , the optical lines are emitted from gas photoionised by the agn and heated by the shocks in the extended nlr . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared lines are better explained by the emission from gas close to the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> the starburst dominates the infrared emission . </S>",
    "<S> [ oi ] and [ ci ] lines in the far - infrared are formed in the internal region of extended clouds and are therefore absorbed , while [ cii ] lines are emitted from the external edges of outflowing clouds . the o / h relative abundances are about solar and n / h are higher than solar by a factor @xmath01.5 , throughout the starburst region , while in the agn extended nlr the o / h ratio is half solar . </S>",
    "<S> a relatively high dust - to - gas ratio is indicated by modelling the dust reprocessed radiation peak consistently with bremsstrahlung emitted from the clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the observed radio emission is thermal bremsstrahlung , while synchrotron radiation created by the fermi mechanism at the shock front is absorbed .    </S>",
