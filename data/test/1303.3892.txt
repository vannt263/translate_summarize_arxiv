    "one of the many achievements of quantum field theories like the standard model is the confirmed prediction of a scale dependence of the physical couplings @xmath2 . in order to know in which way the couplings @xmath3 of a given quantum field theory",
    "depend on the energy scale @xmath4 one usually has to regularize and renormalize the theory .",
    "however , when it comes to gravity a consistent and predictive renormalization and therefore a predictive quantum field theoretical description is still to be found .",
    "independently of how this theory of quantum gravity will look like , in most approaches it is expected to introduce a non - trivial running to the couplings of classical gravity which are newtons `` constant '' @xmath5 and the cosmological constant @xmath6 . in an effective description",
    "those couplings are expected to be present in an improved action and the corresponding solutions .    since on the one hand black holes",
    "are key objects in every classical or quantum gravitational theory and their understanding is crucial for the understanding of the whole model and on the other hand the scale dependence of gravitational couplings has been extensively studied in the context of exact renormalization group ( erg ) equations @xcite , it is natural to study black holes in the context of erg results .",
    "this has been done mostly by improving the classical solutions @xcite .",
    "this procedure has however two weaknesses which basically motivated this study : the first problem is that in order to study black holes in the erg context one has to relate the radial scale of a black hole solution @xmath7 to the energy scale @xmath4 of the erg calculation , this procedure is however not uniquely defined .",
    "the second problem is that the improved solution does not ( at least not at all scales @xcite ) resolve the improved equations of motion nor does it minimize the erg improved action .    as complementary contribution to this program we will follow a philosophy that is somewhat inverse to the existing studies on erg improved black hole solutions . as starting point we will take the improved equations of motions which contain scale depending couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are a priory undetermined .",
    "the working hypothesis will then be to ask for which functional form of those couplings it is possible to solve those equations of motion with the most symmetrically possible metrical ansatz .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secsol ] it",
    "is shown how solving the resulting system of equations determines then the resulting black hole metric and the functional form of @xmath0 and @xmath1 up to the existence of four integration constants .",
    "general properties of this solution such as differences to the studies in the literature , singularities , and the existence of classical - like parameter choices are then discussed .",
    "since both couplings of the present solution are functions of the radial scale @xmath7 , the corresponding adimensional couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be combined in a coupling flow . in section [ secrun ]",
    "this induced flow with an ultra violet fixed point for @xmath8 and @xmath9 is derived , the flow is compared to the flow for @xmath10 and @xmath11 known from erg calculations . finally , the anomalous dimensions of the induced couplings and the product of couplings are discussed and and compared to the findings in the erg approach .    after summarizing remarks in section [ secconcl ]",
    "we give complementary discussions in the appendix [ secappend ] .",
    "up to now black holes where studied in the context of erg equations by taking the classical solutions ( for constant @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and then replacing @xmath5 and @xmath14 in those solutions .",
    "the physical interpretation of those erg improved solutions depends on how the erg scale @xmath4 is related to the physical scale @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure however was only partially successful , since the improved solutions were actually no more solutions of any form of einstein or modified einstein equations .",
    "yet , the improved solution with a cosmological term seems at least to solve the improved equations of motion asymptotically in the uv @xcite .    in order to avoid the danger which is involved with the choice of @xmath15 we will consider directly the fact that all scales are in the end functions of the physical scale @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "when doing so we pretend to find a solution which is still an exact solution of the equations motion .",
    "the corresponding improved equation of motion is @xcite ( see also appendix [ appendeom ] ) @xmath18 with t_=g(r)(g_- _ _ ) . at first instance",
    "we are interested in spherically symmetric solutions in regions where the classical matter contribution @xmath19 .",
    "as ansatz for the metric tensor we use [ ansatz ] ds^2=-f(r ) dt^2 + 1/f(r)dr^2 + r^2 d^2 + r^2 ( ) d^2 where [ fvonr ] f(r)=(1 - 2-r^2 ) . with this ansatz the einstein equations ( [ eom2 ] ) reduce to three independent differential equations for the a priory unknown functions @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "please note that the constant @xmath22 would only be the mass of the black hole , if @xmath12 and @xmath23 would be constants . in the context of variable constants",
    ", however , @xmath22 is only an arbitrary constant with units of mass , which can take arbitrary ( even negative ) values .",
    "it was found that , apart from the well known solutions , which imply constant couplings , there exists a solution with a non trivial @xmath7 dependence [ gvonr ] g(r)&=&- , + [ lvonr ] ( r)&=&\\{-2 c_1 ( c_1 ^ 2 ( 12 c_1 ^ 2 + 384 c_2+c_3)+24 r^3 c_1 ^ 3 c_4 + .. + & & .3 r^2 ( 384 c_2+c_3 - 24 c_1 ^ 4 c_4)+6 r c_1 ( -c_1 ^ 2 - 384 c_2-c_3 + 8 c_1 ^ 4 c_4 ) ) + & & .+3 r ( r^2 - 3 r c_1 + 2 c_1 ^ 2 ) ( 384 c_2+c_3 ) -3 r ( r^2 - 3 r c_1 + 2 c_1 ^ 2 ) ( 384 c_2+c_3 ) } , + [ llvonr ] l(r)&= & c_4+\\{++ .",

    "those solutions contain four constants of integration @xmath24 . the role and the interpretation of those constants in terms of different physical perspectives",
    "will be discussed throughout this paper .",
    "one of the first questions one might ask for this new kind of solution is whether it has the same singularity problem at the origin as the standard solution or whether there exist parameter configurations for which the singularity can be avoided .",
    "this can be checked by calculating the invariant tensor density which gives to lowest order in @xmath25 r _",
    "r^ = + ( r^-5 ) .",
    "the divergence to this order can be avoided by choosing @xmath26 with c_2 = - .",
    "this choice removes a number of divergent terms such that the remaining next to next to next to leading singularity reads r _",
    "r^|_c_2 = + ( r^-1 ) .",
    "if one further tries to remove this singularity , one is forced to take @xmath27 , where the value for @xmath28 has to be chosen , before one takes the limit in @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to a finite tensor density r _ r^|_c_2 , c_1 = c_4 ^ 2 , but this choice of the integration constants is actually almost trivial because corresponds to flat ( anti ) de sitter space f(r)|_c_2 , c_1 = 1-r^2 .",
    "since the equation of motion ( [ eom2 ] ) can be interpreted as a special case of an @xmath30 theory @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) one has to check , whether the above solution has already been discussed in the context of the more general @xmath30 theories .",
    "a class of solutions with constant curvature @xmath31 and perturbative expansions around the `` classical '' solutions has been discussed in @xcite and special solutions with conformal anomaly have been discussed in @xcite . other perturbative solutions ( assuming @xmath32 ) to @xmath30 theories in their transition limit to general relativity can be found in @xcite .",
    "further variations of the classical solution have also been studied in the context of kerr black holes @xcite . for an exact solution that assumes a finite @xmath33 and constant curvature @xmath34 , which generalizes to charged , rotating black holes",
    "see @xcite .",
    "none of the above solutions contains ( [ gvonr]-[llvonr ] ) since here , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is not constant , and the solution is not a perturbation of a classical solution .",
    "thus , to our current knowledge ( [ gvonr]-[llvonr ] ) has not been discussed in the context of @xmath30 theories .",
    "an other very similar approach is brans dicke theory @xcite where one allows for a varying gravitational constant @xmath37 . in difference to this approach , the brans dicke action contains a kinetic term @xmath38 .",
    "it the limit @xmath39 this theory corresponds to constant coupling and standard general relativity",
    ". solutions of bd with the limit @xmath40 correspond to our erg inspired approach .",
    "black hole solutions in pure brans dicke theory have been discussed .",
    "first black hole solutions for this theory have been found by brans @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that all bd black holes that have constant @xmath41 in the outside region and that are static solutions correspond to the known schwarzschild , kerr or kerr - newman solutions . if one relaxes the condition of constant fields further non - trivial solutions have been found @xcite .",
    "this solution does not apply here , since it has @xmath42 . in @xcite",
    "bd black holes have been studied in the lifshitz context .",
    "bd black hole solutions with a specific cosmological term @xmath43 have been found and discussed in @xcite . based on those studies",
    "@xcite discussed further generalizations of bd -ads bhs . by using dilaton black hole solutions with a cosmological term @xmath44",
    "they construct via a conformal transformation @xmath45 the bd solution with the cosmological term @xmath43 .",
    "this method , however , works only for larger space - time dimensions @xmath46 since this conformal transformation is ill defined for @xmath47 .",
    "this reflects also in the fact that the metric coefficients of those bd solutions diverge for four space - time dimensions .",
    "it is also instructive to do a comparison with an approximated black holes solution of brans dicke theory given by weinberg @xcite ( page 183 and page 247 ) for the case that gives the schwarzschild solution plus corrections in @xmath25 [ epand1 ] ds^2=(1 - 2++  )dt^2",
    "-(1++  ) dr^2 -r^2 d^2 -r^2 ^2d^2 . comparing this approximation with @xmath48 to the series expansion in @xmath25 of the exact solution one finds that one can at best fix the constants @xmath29 , and @xmath49 in combination with a time rescaling ( @xmath50 ) , such that [ epand2 ] ds^2=(1 - 2++  )dt^2 -(2 + 2 +  ) dr^2 -r^2 d^2 -r^2 ^2d^2 . both expansions ( [ epand1 ] and [ epand2 ] ) do not agree in the constant coefficient of the @xmath51 component .",
    "if one wants to demand a regime where the exact solution has a constant factor @xmath52 for both @xmath53 and @xmath54 one has fix the constants for an expansion around @xmath55 , as it is discussed in the following subsection .",
    "this also can not be fixed by just varying the initial metric ansatz by @xmath56 . in terms of physical viability",
    "this is a severe problem , because the above expansion for @xmath48 basically predicts that this new solution would contradict all gravitational lensing effects with relativistic trajectories . in order to address this concern",
    "we will first ask , whether there exist special parameter choices ( with @xmath57 ) for which the new solution approximates to the ( for wide ranges of @xmath7 ) well confirmed classical solution .      given",
    "the problems for the @xmath25 expansion for @xmath48 we will now study the case @xmath57 and by trying to approximate the new solution to the standard solution where [ fstandard ] f_s(r)=1 - 2 -r^2 . as it can bee seen from equation ( [ epand2 ] ) , not even reproducing the standard result without cosmological constant is trivially possible .",
    "thus , one has to ask the question , whether there is any configuration of the parameters ( @xmath58 ) which is in agreement with current experimental results , which basically confirm ( [ fstandard ] ) . by constructing an approximation to the standard metric ( [ fstandard ] ) it",
    "will now be shown that such parameter choices exist .",
    "an important property of the standard metric in the de sitter case is that it approximates to a plane flat space for large @xmath7 , before it runs into an other horizon at even larger distances .",
    "thus , we try to fix the constant @xmath59 such that there exists a @xmath60 with f(r_m)=1 f|_r_m=0 .",
