    "massive data from online social media and online social networking ( osn ) enables accurate analysis of the human behavior and of the interaction times between individuals through technology such as in word - of - mouth marketing , opportunistic networking and viral spreading .",
    "empirical measurements contradict the commonly assumed exponential distribution of poissonian inter - event times @xcite in spreading processes or epidemic models .",
    "multiple publications @xcite report that _ the interactivity time _ , defined as the duration between two consecutive tasks like sending emails , accessing web pages , instant messaging and phone calls , follow power - law distributions .",
    "these findings recently led to non - markovian analyses , addressed in the work of cator _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , iribarren and moro @xcite , van mieghem and van de bovenkamp @xcite and schweizer _ et al .",
    "given that the inter - activity distributions are heavy tailed , word - of - mouth spreading , viral infections or dynamics of memes are expected to endure or survive longer , compared to basic markovian models @xcite .",
    "barabasi @xcite infers that heavy - tailed distributions may arise from a priority queue , where individuals execute tasks of which the majority can be completed in short time , but some tasks wait long due to a perceived priority .",
    "barabasi s priority queue model fits the distribution of durations between events quite well , leading to a power - law distribution with an exponent @xmath0 around 1 .",
    "a power - law random variable @xmath1 has the probability density function @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the lower bound for @xmath5 .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of a lognormal random variable @xmath5 for @xmath6 is @xmath7   } { \\sigma t\\sqrt{2\\pi } }   \\label{pdf_lognormal}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are called the parameters of the lognormal pdf , that are the mean and variance of @xmath9 as shown in appendix [ sec_properties_lognormal ] .",
    "when we assume that inter - event durations are power - law distributed , we encounter the following issues :    1 .   in many cases , only a part of the data ( the tail larger than @xmath10 ) is modeled by a power - law .",
    "the lower bound @xmath10 in ( [ pdf_powerlaw ] ) does not correspond to the physical minimum of the random variable @xmath5 , but @xmath10 is fitted from the data by ignoring smaller values that do not obey the power - law .",
    "often , these smaller values may have a large probability to occur , so that their neglect is difficult to justify .",
    "in other words , only a part of the process ( above @xmath10 ) is modeled by a power - law ( [ pdf_powerlaw ] ) , while the other part ( below @xmath10 ) is not .",
    "most processes or measurements possess both a lower as well as an upper bound .",
    "apart from the lower bound @xmath10 , an upper bound @xmath11 is often invoked , at which a cut - off is observed : the power - law behavior is confined to the range @xmath12 , although @xmath13 and @xmath14 . however , it is often unclear whether the process in the deep tail still obeys a power - law distribution or some other , much faster decreasing distribution .",
    "the upper bound @xmath11 is usually empirically determined , rather than based on the physical maximum of @xmath5 .",
    "as long as @xmath15=c\\int_{\\kappa}^{\\infty}t^{-\\gamma}dt=\\left (   \\frac{\\kappa}{\\tau}\\right )   ^{1-\\gamma}\\ ] ] is small ( with respect to the measurement precision ) , the upper bound @xmath11 is justified , else other validation arguments are needed .",
    "3 .   we demonstrate here that the binning of data ( either by the data - provider or by the researcher ) alters the shape of a lognormal distribution into an apparent power - law .    particularly in relation to human activities or behaviors",
    ", we question in this paper the widely assumed power - law distribution .",
    "we present measurements of inter - event durations from digg.com and reddit.com , two online social news aggregators @xcite , and from the enron data set , a collection of emails sent by employees of the company enron , and argue that a lognormal distribution is a valid candidate for the distribution of human inter - event durations in section [ sec_measurements ] .",
    "the problem of fitting a lognormal is explained in section [ sec_fittinglognormal ] , followed by previously reported lognormally distributed data sets in section [ sec_reported_parameters ] .",
    "existing theoretical models are compared in section [ sec_debate ] , a plausible interpretation for lognormal human behavior is proposed in section [ sec_plausible_explanation_lognormal_interactivity_times ] and section [ sec_conclusion ] concludes .",
    "mathematical properties of the lognormal distribution are deferred to the appendix [ sec_properties_lognormal ] .",
    "appendix [ sec_likelihood_testing ] presents results of likelihood tests for the observed distributions .",
    "all events in an osn are based on users activities , such as posts , friend - requests and comments . a complete data set including all activities of users from digg.com for a duration of 4 years , described in tang _",

    "the process of adding friends shows bursts of activity also observed and analyzed in email communication @xcite . in these publications the question arises , whether the observed distribution of inter - activity times is described by a power - law , lognormal or a cascading poisson process .",
    "@xcite describe that circadian and weekly activity cycles in human behavior are the factors that lead to heavy tails .",
    "they proposed a cascading poisson process , consisting of a _ nonhomogeneous _ poisson process that reflects periodicity and a _ homogeneous _ poisson process describing active intervals , which is shown to model the interactivity distributions of e - mail communication .    because the network of digg.com is directed ( like in twitter.com or other osns ) ,",
    "a user can be followed by other users to become their friend , while a user can not add followers .",

    "an estimated p - value of 0.0 indicates that a power - law fit provides not the best solution , whereas the p - value for @xmath18 of @xmath24 indicates a reasonable fit for a power - law distribution .",
    "the reason that the distribution of @xmath19 does not fit the lognormal distribution over the whole range lies in the nature of digg.com .",
    "@xcite showed that only a few users were active over a long period , while just a fraction of them was actually submitting stories .",
    "only 2% of all registered users succeeded to have their submissions promoted  to the frontpage @xcite .",
    "since the username of a submitter appears next to the story , these users receive a lot of followers during the relatively small period that their story was listed on the front page .",

    "[ fig_binsize1s_followers ] . in summary , even ignoring the small time values , the random variable @xmath18 and @xmath19 possess different distributions . the process that generates @xmath18 is more likely described by a variant of barabasi s priority queue model , leading to power - law behavior .",
    "since the random variable @xmath19 is generated by the collective dynamics of different individuals ( that are likely weakly dependent ) , central limit law arguments may point towards the lognormal distribution @xcite .",

    "in this paper , the interactivity durations of individuals , between creating friendship relations , writing emails , commenting and voting on online content are analyzed .",
    "we found that the distribution of durations to add friends follows a power - law with an exponent of @xmath122 , whereas the durations to acquire followers are well described by a lognormal with @xmath123 and @xmath124 . due to the small probability of executing two tasks in a small time interval ( typically ignored in fitting a power law )",
    ", we claim that a lognormal distribution covers the entire activity time range better than a power distribution .",
    "in addition , we show that binning of lognormally distributed data can seriously affect the perception : the parameter @xmath55 shifts towards smaller values , but the parameter @xmath56 of a lognormal distribution does not change after a binning or scaling operation . in the extreme case",
    ", only the heavy tail of the lognormal distribution ( [ pdf_lognormal ] ) remains , which follows a power - law distribution ( [ pdf_powerlaw ] ) with an exponent of @xmath0 close to 1 .",
    "as explained in the appendix , there exists an interval in which the lognormal distribution is indistinguishable from a power - law distributions with power - law exponent @xmath125 , for small @xmath126 .",
    "similar observations and concerns , discussed for a long time in the literature of city size and income distributions and reviewed in section [ sec_debate ] , supports that a lognormal distribution is modeling the whole data range better than power - laws .",
    "finally , section [ sec_plausible_explanation_lognormal_interactivity_times ] argues that the logarithm of a quantity associated with human activities rather than the quantity itself is the better descriptor , because human performance seems to fit a lognormal .",
