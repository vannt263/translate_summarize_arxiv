    "the smaller voids are dominated by low surface brightness ( lsb ) dwarfs and irregular galaxies ( karachentsev etal .",
    "1999 ) but the larger voids also have a population of relatively bright galaxies that are often blue in color . these galaxies have ongoing star formation and are often interacting with companion galaxies in pairs or small groups along filaments in the voids ( beygu et al . 2013 ) .",
    "many questions remain regarding star formation in void environments ; what is its nature - is it sporadic or continuous , what drives it and how is the star formation related to the location of the galaxies with respect to the filaments , walls and void interiors  ?",
    "one of the key elements for supporting star formation in galaxies is the presence of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) gas .",
    "although neutral hydrogen has been both detected and mapped in several voids , not much is known about the distribution of @xmath3 gas in void galaxies .",
    "there have been two studies that have detected co emission and estimated molecular gas masses in a total of five void galaxies ( sage et al .",

    "these results indicate that the @xmath3 gas masses in void galaxies are comparable to those found in nearby star forming systems . in this study we searched for molecular gas in void galaxies to obtain a larger sample of such @xmath3 rich galaxies and carried out followup h@xmath0 imaging observations of some of the detected galaxies .",
    "our main motivation was to understand how the cold gas masses relate to the star formation properties of these systems . in the following sections we present our observations , results and discuss their implications .",

    "the on source time for the first four galaxies varied between 1 to 1.5 hours ; due to poor weather conditions sbs  1428 + 529 was observed for only 25 minutes .",
