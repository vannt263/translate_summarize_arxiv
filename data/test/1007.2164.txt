    "about 25 years ago , renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) indicated globular clusters ( gcs ) as the best examples in nature of a simple stellar population , being defined as an assembly of coeval , initially chemically homogeneous , single stars .",
    "however , recent photometric and spectroscopic studies significantly challenged this traditional paradigm , changing our perspective . in a recent survey , focusing on 19 galactic gcs , carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b , hereafter c09 ) have convincingly shown that each gc is composed of multiple stellar generations , with the coexistence of both first ( fg , with low na / al / n and high o / mg / c ) and second generation ( sg ) stars ( high na / al / n and low o / mg / c ) . briefly , according to na abundance and [ o / na ] ratios , gc members were classified as fg ( primordial ( p ) stars ) and sg stars , the last one being further divided into intermediate ( i ) and extreme ( e ; see carretta et al .",
    "2009b for a detailed description on pie classification ) .",
    "the main results found by carretta and coworkers can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the p population is present in all gcs ( at the @xmath030% level ) , ( 2 ) the i population constitutes the bulk ( 50%-70% ) of gc stars , and ( 3 ) the e component is instead not present in all gcs .",
    "the chemical composition of sg stars indicates that they are formed from fg stars within a limited mass range ; hence , in order to reproduce the currently observed ratio between fg and sg stars ( about 1/3 fg versus 2/3 sg ) , the original cluster population should have been much larger than the current value . in a companion paper ,",
    "carretta et al .",
    "( 2010 ) indeed concluded that during the early epochs of dynamical evolution , a proto - gc should have lost up to @xmath090% ( or even more , see , e.g. , gratton & carretta 2010 ) of its p population .",
    "as a consequence they suggested that the p stars in gcs might be the major building blocks of the stellar halo .    in general , the basic idea expressed in carretta et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is that a gc , a few 10@xmath1yr old , should appear as a rather compact aggregate of stars immersed in a loose , wide association and in an even larger expanding gas cloud ( note that such objects are indeed observed in extragalactic systems , and especially in the interacting ones , see , e.g. , vinko et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "for the subsequent evolution , following the approach by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , carretta et al . suggested that sg stars formed in the central cluster regions , where ejecta of the fg component are channeled into a cooling flow .",
    "a small fraction of p stars are trapped in the dense , central cluster regions formed by sg stars : this is the typical gc that we can observe nowadays .",
    "this proposed scenario is still qualitative , given the lack of more stringent observational evidences to quantitatively constrain such indications . along with uncertainties on cluster formation and early evolution , the nature of polluter stars responsible for the peculiar chemical pattern observed in gcs is also still unclear .",
    "in fact , the presence of na@xmath2o ( and also mg@xmath2al ) anticorrelations also among the main - sequence to stars ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 , cohen et al .",
    "2002 , carretta et al .",
    "2004 , pasquini et al .",
    "2005 , lind et al . 2009 , dorazi et al .",
    "2010 ) definitively demonstrated that a previous generation of stars , in which the complete cno cycle has operated , originates chemical ( anti)correlations found in gcs .",
    "the nature of the polluters is still debated , the main candidates being intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( im@xmath2agb ; 5@xmath28m@xmath3 ) stars in hot bottom burning phase ( ventura & dantona 2009 ) , or fast rotating massive stars ( frms ; e.g. , decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) , or massive binaries ( de mink et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "a complementary approach to proton - capture element abundance determination , is the study of the @xmath4-process elements , like e.g. , barium ( see , e.g. , smith 2008 ) .",
    "this information can allow to address both ( 1 ) the formation and early evolution mechanisms in gcs and ( 2 ) the origin of the massive , previous generation stars which produced the ejecta for the intracluster enrichment .",
    "the derivation of ba abundances for a very large sample of gc stars allows discovering the presence of the so - called ba stars .",
    "spectra of ba stars are characterized by unusually strong ch , cn , and heavy elements ( e.g. , baii , srii ) features .",
    "it is now well assessed that ba stars are long - period , single - lined spectroscopic binary systems ( mcclure 1989 ) : the nucleosynthetic pattern observed can be attributed to now unseen companions , which at earlier epoch were low - mass ( @xmath53m@xmath6 ) agb stars that transferred processed material to the surviving visible stars ( luck & bond 1991 ) .",
    "the binary system should originally have had a wide enough separation to allow evolution of the primary up to the agb ( for a discussion on ba stars in gcs , see gratton et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the presence and the fraction of ba stars within gcs indirectly provide hints on binarity properties in dense stellar systems , shedding light on formation and evolution mechanisms . in this sense ,",
    "given the quite limited number of known ba stars in stellar clusters , large samples are crucial to derive statistically significant information .",
    "moreover , the simultaneous determinations for the very same stars of na , o and ba abundances offer the possibility to unveil possible differences ( or analogies ) between binary fraction in fg and sg stars .",
    "interestingly , determinations of the binary fractions in different stellar generations allow to infer key information on density conditions of their formation environment .",
    "in fact , it is now well known that the binary incidence is directly related to the environmental density ( e.g. , lada & lada 2003 ) : this is a basic constraint for hydrodynamical simulations of gc formation and early evolution .",
    "as far as point ( 2 ) is concerned , our work aimed at determining ba variation inside each gc as signature of low - mass agb stars contribution to pollution scenario .",
    "in fact , for stars with masses @xmath53 m@xmath3 , the third dredge - up becomes very efficient resulting in an @xmath4-process element enhancement .",
    "in this letter we present our results on ba determination for a sample of 15 gcs , for a grand total of more than 1200 stars .",
    "the huge database allowed us to obtain very interesting results minimizing the impact of the observational uncertainties .",
    "this is by far the largest survey of ba abundances in gc stars available to date .",
    "we analyzed high - quality , high - resolution flames / giraffe spectra ( pasquini et al . 2002 ) for a sample of 1205 red giants in 15 galactic gcs , in order to derive ba abundances .",
    "details on target selections , observations , data reduction , along with @xmath7-capture elements abundances are given in c09 .",
    "using the kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres with the rosa abundance code ( gratton 1988 ) , we obtained ba abundances by measuring equivalent widths ( ews ) for the only ba  ii feature covered by our spectral setup ( hr13 ) , namely the line at 6141  .",
    "ba lines present hyperfine structure occurring in odd isotopes ( @xmath8ba and @xmath9ba ) ; moreover the lines due to the five ba isotopes have small isotopic wavelength shifts . however , both these effects are significant only for ba  ii resonance lines , i.e. , 4554 and 4934  , while the 6141    line is scarcely affected ( see , e.g. , sneden et al .",
    "moreover , the blend with the fe  i line at 6141.73    has a negligible impact at the low metallicity of gcs and can be ignored .",
    "iron abundances were presented in carretta et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , while stellar parameters ( @xmath10 , log  @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) were previously derived by c09 , to which we refer also for details on error estimates . here",
    ", we just mention that , since we aimed at discovering possible star - to - star variations within each gc , systematic errors have a rather small effect . finally ,",
    "since this ba line is near the saturation regime ( with rather high ew values ) , the dominant source of ( internal ) uncertainty is given by the adopted microturbulences , the final values of effective temperatures and gravity having only a small impact .",

    "empty and filled squares are for disk / bulge gc and inner halo gcs ; the filled triangle is for the only outer halo cluster ngc  1904",

    "in this letter , we report our results on ba abundance determination for a sample of more than 1200 giants in 15 galactic gcs . we provide the largest , homogeneous analysis of this kind available in literature to date .",
    "we found that there is no star - to - star variation in ba content within each cluster , with the standard deviation from the mean compatible with the expected uncertainties ( the only exception being the low - metallicity ngc  7078 , for which , however , a pure @xmath13-process pattern has been proposed by several authors ) .",
    "our results suggest that there is no detectable contribution to intra - cluster pollution from low - mass agb stars , whose products are @xmath4-process elements enhanced due to the efficiency of the third dredge - up .",
    "we discovered the presence of five ba stars , confirming that the fraction of these originally quite wide binary systems is lower in gcs than in the field .",
    "we also found that four out of the five ba stars belong to the p population : this likely reflects the different environmental conditions where the two stellar generations formed .",
    "this new result supports the formation / evolution scenario for gc in which the sg stars were born at the cluster center , where the infant mortality of long - period binaries is significantly higher .    to have a further validation of this piece of evidence",
    ", we also searched for binary stars in ngc  6121 : for this cluster , we determined rather large radial velocity variations for five stars on a total of @xmath0100 .",
    "also in this case we obtained that only one binary belongs to sg stars , and that the fraction of binary stars among the p component reaches a value of @xmath012% , to be compared with the small percentage in sg , i.e. , @xmath01% .    in the future , we will focus on the determination of radial velocity variations among a large sample of gcs and of stars within each gc .",
    "we aim at inferring binarity properties in the fg and sg of gcs , as excellent tracer of the environmental conditions where gcs formed and evolved .",
