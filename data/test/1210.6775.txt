    "[ sec : intro ]    an impressive amount of data on backward hadron production in p+c interactions has been collected over the past four decades .",
    "a literature survey reveals no less than 19 experiments which have contributed a total amount of more than 3500 data points covering wide areas in projectile momentum , lab angle and lab momentum .",
    "looking at the physics motivation and at the distribution in time of these efforts , two distinct classes of experimental approaches become evident .",
    "15 experiments cluster in a first period during the two decades between 1970 and 1990 .",
    "all these measurements have been motivated by the nuclear part of proton - nucleus collisions , in particular by the width of the momentum distributions in the nuclear rest system which reach far beyond the narrow limits expected from nuclear binding alone .",
    "these studies have ceased in the late 1980 s with the advent of relativistic heavy ion collisions and their promise of `` new '' phenomena beyond the realm of classic nuclear physics .    a second class of very recent measurements has appeared and is being pursued after the turn of the century , with publications starting about 2008 .",
    "here the motivation is totally different .",
    "it is driven by the necessity of obtaining hadronic reference data for the study of systematic effects in cosmic ray and neutrino physics , in particular concerning atmospheric and long base line experiments as well as eventual novel neutrino factories .",
    "the main aim of these studies is the comparison to and the improvement of hadronic production models ",
    "models which are to be considered as multi - parameter descriptions of the non - calculable sector of the strong interaction , with very limited predictive power .",
    "this new and exclusive aim has led to the strange situation that if all recent publications contain detailed comparisons to available production models , no comparison to existing data is attempted .",
    "it remains therefore unclear how these new results compare to the wealth of already available data and whether they in fact may over - ride and replace the existing results .",
    "in this environment the studies conducted since 15 years by the na49 experiment at the cern sps have a completely different aim . here",
    "it is attempted to trace a model - independent way from the basic hadron - nucleon interaction via hadron - nucleus to nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this aim needs precision data from a large variety of projectile and target combinations as well as a maximum phase space coverage . as the acceptance of the na49 detector",
    "is limited to lab angles below 45 degrees , it is indicated to use existing backward data in the sps energy range in order to extend the acceptance coverage for the asymmetric proton - nucleus interactions .",
    "this requires a careful study of the dependence on cms energy and of the reliability of the results to be used .    in the course of this work it appeared useful and even mandatory to provide a survey of all available data over the full scale of interaction energies , the more so as no overview of the experimental situation is available to date .",
    "this means that the present study deals with projectile momenta from 1 to 400  gev / c , for a lab angle range from 10 to 180  degrees , and for lab momenta from 0.2 to 1.2  gev / c .",
    "[ sec : var_kin ]    most available data have been obtained as a function of the lab momentum @xmath8 ( or kinetic energy @xmath9 ) at constant lab angle @xmath10 . in this publication",
    "all given yields are transformed to the double differential invariant cross section    @xmath11    in this context the term `` backward '' needs a precise definition .",
    "one possibility would be to define as `` backward '' the region of lab angles @xmath12  90  degrees .",
    "the present paper uses instead a definition which refers to the cms frame with the basic variables feynman @xmath13 and transverse momentum @xmath14 , defining as `` backward '' the particle yields at @xmath15  0 .",
    "this allows a clear separation of the projectile fragmentation region at positive @xmath13 with a limited feed - over into negative @xmath13 and the target fragmentation region at negative @xmath13 with a limited feed - over into positive @xmath13 . at the same time",
    "the notion of `` kinematic limit '' in participant fragmentation is clearly brought out at @xmath13  =  @xmath16  1 and the contributions from intranuclear cascading may be clearly visualized and eventually separated .",
    "and @xmath10 in the cms frame spanned by feynman @xmath13 and @xmath14 for protons and pions at two different projectile momenta , a ) protons at 158  gev / c , b ) protons at 3  gev / c , c ) pions at 158  gev / c and d ) pions at 3  gev / c , width=510 ]    the correlation between the two pairs of variables is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : kinematics ] which shows lines of constant @xmath8 and @xmath10 in the coordinate frame of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for protons and pions for the two values of projectile momentum at 158 and 3  gev / c which are representative of the typical range of interaction energies discussed in this paper .",
    "several comments are due in this context .",
    "the definition of feynman @xmath13 has been modified from the standard one ,    @xmath17    to    @xmath18    with @xmath19 the proton mass .",
    "this takes care of baryon number conservation and regularises the kinematic borders at low interaction energies . the @xmath20 dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] is small to negligible for lab angles above about 50  degrees both for pions and protons but becomes noticeable at small @xmath10 .",
    "if at sps energy the full range of lab momenta up to 1.4  gev / c and angles above 10  degrees is confined to the backward region both for protons and pions , the coverage for pions extends to positive @xmath13 at low lab angles and low beam momenta .",
    "another remark concerns the overlap between target fragmentation and nuclear cascading . for protons , at all lab angles above about 70  degrees the kinematic limit for fragmentation of a target nucleon at rest in the lab system is exceeded . for pions on the other hand",
    "this is not the case as their @xmath13 value for @xmath8  =  0 is at",
    "@xmath21    this means that over the full range of lab angles and up to large @xmath8 values the contribution from target participants mixes with the nuclear component .",
    "the separation of the two processes therefore becomes an important task , see sect .",
    "[ sec : separation ] of this paper .",
    "a last remark is due to the limits of experimental coverage .",
    "all existing experiments run out of statistics at cross section levels of about 10  @xmath22b , that is about 4 orders of magnitude below the maximum yields . as visible from the momentum ranges indicated in tables 1 and 2",
    ", this corresponds to a typical upper momentum cut - off in the region of 1  gev / c .",
    "[ sec : exp_sit ]    the backward phase space coverage in p+c interactions is surprisingly complete if compared with the forward direction and even with the available data in the elementary p+p collisions .",
    "this is apparent from the list of experiments given in tables  [ tab : prot_data ] and [ tab : pion_data ] with their ranges in beam momentum , lab angle , and lab momentum .",
    "although some effort has been spent to pick up all published results , this list is not claimed to be exhaustive as some results given as `` private communication '' , in conference proceedings or unpublished internal reports might have escaped attention .",
    ".data sets for proton production in p+c and n+c collisions from seven experiments giving the ranges covered in projectile momentum , lab angle , and lab momentum , the number of measured data points and errors [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for secondary protons , table  [ tab : prot_data ] , the important amount of low energy n+c data by franz et al .",
    "@xcite has been added to the survey as the isospin factors for the transformation into p+c results have been studied and determined with some precision , see sect .",
    "[ sec : prot ] .    for secondary pions , table  [ tab : pion_data ] , the situation is somewhat complicated by the fact that two independent sets of results have been published by the harp - cdp @xcite and the harp @xcite groups , based on identical input data obtained with the same detector . an attempt to clarify this partially contradictory situation",
    "is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : harp ] of this paper .",
    "unfortunately , no commonly agreed scale in the three basic variables @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath23 of the double - differential cross sections has been defined by the different collaborations providing the data contained in tables  [ tab : prot_data ] and [ tab : pion_data ] .",
    "this leads to the fact that not a single couple out of the more than 3500 data points contained in these tables may be directly compared .",
    "the application of an interpolation scheme as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : comp ] is therefore an absolute necessity .",
    "ideally the thus obtained interpolated cross sections would form an internally consistent sample of results which would be coherent within the given experimental errors . as will become apparent in the following data comparison ,",
    "this assumption is surprisingly well fulfilled for the majority of the experiments .",
    "only four of the 20 quoted groups of results fall significantly out of this comparison ; those will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : dev_exp ] of this paper . in this sense",
    "the overall survey of the backward proton and pion production results in a powerful constraint for the comparison with any new data sample .",
    "[ sec : comp ]    as stated above the main problem in bringing the wealth of available data into a consistent picture is given by the generally disparate position in phase space and interaction energy of the different experiments .",
    "the triplet of lab variables given by the beam momentum @xmath23 , the lab momentum @xmath8 and the lab angle @xmath10 has been used for the establishment of the following interpolation scheme . in addition and of course",
    ", the statistical and systematic errors have to be taken into account in the data comparison .",
    "[ sec : errors ]    the last columns of tables  [ tab : prot_data ] and [ tab : pion_data ] contain some information about the statistical and systematic errors of the different experiments .",
    "the given numbers are to be regarded as mean values excluding some upward tails as they are inevitable at the limits of the covered phase space in particular for the statistical uncertainties . in some cases",
    "only rudimentary information about the systematic errors is available or the systematic and statistical errors are even combined into one quantity . in the latter cases these values",
    "are given in between the respective columns of table  [ tab : pion_data ] .",
    "inspection of these approximate error levels reveals a rather broad band of uncertainties ranging from about 4% to about 20% , the latter limit being generally defined by overall normalization errors .",
    "the presence of extensive data sets well below the 10% range of both statistical and systematic errors gives however some hope that a resulting overall consistency on this level might become attainable by the extensive use of data interpolation .",
    "the term `` interpolation '' is to be regarded in this context as a smooth interconnection of the data points in any of the three phase space variables defined above .",
    "this interconnection is generally done by eyeball fits which offer , within the error limits shown above , sufficient accuracy .",
    "if the distributions in @xmath10 and interaction energy are anyway not describable by straight - forward arithmetic parametrization , the @xmath8 dependences are , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : pldep ] below , in a majority of cases approximately exponential . in these cases",
    "exponential fits have been used if applicable .    as additional constraint physics asks of course for smoothness and continuity in all three variables simultaneously .",
    "therefore the resulting overall data interpolation has to attempt a three - dimensional consistency .",
    "if the data interpolation helps , by the inter - correlation of data points , to reduce the local statistical fluctuations , it does of course not reduce the systematic uncertainties .",
    "it is rather on the level of systematic deviations that the consistency of different experimental results is to be judged .",
    "it will become apparent from the detailed discussion described below that the majority of the quoted experiments allows for the establishment of a surprisingly consistent overall description in all three variables .",
    "[ sec : sdep ]    as the data discussed here span an extremely wide range of cms energy from close to production threshold to the upper range of fermilab energies , a suitable compression of the energy scale has been introduced in order to be able to present the results in a close - to - equidistant fashion against energy .",
    "the form chosen here is the variable @xmath24 .",
    "this choice is suggested by the considerable amount of work invested in studying the approach of hadronic cross sections to the scaling limit at high energy in the 1970 s @xcite .",
    "in fact the regge parametrization suggested a smooth dependence of the cross sections as @xmath25 , with @xmath26  =  0.250.5 depending on the choice of trajectories involved .",
    "such behaviour was indeed found experimentally . in the present study the cross sections turn out to have only a mild @xmath24 dependence for @xmath27  5  gev , a dependence which is however different for pions and protons .",
    "this dependence is strongly modified below @xmath28  2.5  gev due to threshold effects .",
    "[ sec : thdep ]    a convenient and often used scale for the lab angle dependence is given by @xmath29 .",
    "this scale has the advantage of producing shapes that are again to zero order exponential .",
    "of course , continuity through @xmath10  =  180  degrees imposes an approach to 180  degrees with tangent zero .",
    "as the data samples are generally not measured at common values of @xmath10 , a fixed grid of angles has been defined based on the @xmath10 values of the harp - cdp experiment @xcite dominating the range from 25 to 112  degrees .",
    "measured values down to 10  degrees and in the higher angular range at 137 , 160 , and 180  degrees have been added .",
    "measurements not corresponding to these grid values are interpolated using the @xmath29 distributions specified below .",
    "[ sec : pldep ]    all data discussed here have been transformed into invariant cross sections ( [ eq : ddcs ] ) .",
    "this facilitates the presentation in different coordinate systems and eliminates the trivial approach of the phase space element to zero with decreasing momentum .",
    "in addition , most of the invariant @xmath8 distributions are close to exponential within the measured @xmath8 range .",
    "there are notable deviations mostly at low momentum and in the lower ( higher ) range of lab angles for pions and protons , respectively , as well as in the approach to threshold . in these cases",
    "an eyeball fit has been used which can be reliably performed within the error margins indicated above .    at low lab momenta physics",
    "requires a deviation from the exponential shape as the invariant cross sections must approach @xmath8  =  0 with tangent zero .",

    "the data presented here fall practically all above these momentum limits .",

    "concerning the lower and upper limits of this grid , an extrapolation beyond the limits given by the experimental values has been performed in some cases .",

    "[ sec : ph ]    in the absence of theoretical predictability in the soft sector of the strong interaction , any attempt at bringing a multitude of experimental results into a common and consistent picture has to rely on a minimal set of model - independent physics constraints .",

    "the same is true for angular distributions in their approach to 180  degrees .",
    "[ sec : ph2 ]    it is a matter of experimental experience in the realm of soft hadronic interactions that in general distributions in any kind of kinematic variable tend to be `` smooth '' in the sense of absence of abrupt local upwards or downwards variations .",
    "the widespread use of simple algebraic parametrizations has its origin in this fact , specifically in the absence of local maxima and minima , with the eventual exception of threshold behaviour of which some examples will become visible below .      [",
    "sec : ph3 ]    charge conservation has of course to be fulfilled by any type of experimental result .",
    "this means for instance that for the interaction of a positively charged projectile ( proton ) with an isoscalar nucleus ( carbon ) the @xmath39 ratio has to be greater or equal to unity over the full phase space invoking isospin symmetry ( and of course the experience from a wide range of experimental results ) .",
    "the presence of data with @xmath40  1 therefore immediately indicates experimental problems .",
    "the inspection of @xmath39 ratios has the further advantage that a large part of the systematic uncertainties , notably the overall normalization errors , cancel in this ratio .",
    "[ sec : ph4 ]    it has been shown that in proton induced nuclear collisions the yields of the secondary protons and neutrons are related by a constant factor of about 2 which is in turn related to the ratio of the basic nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",

    "@xcite from n+c interactions has therefore been included in the present survey .",
    "these data present a welcome extension of the @xmath24 scale into the region 0.47 to 0.49 which is not covered for most of the angular range with proton projectiles .",

    "@xcite and komarov et al .",

[ sec : ph5 ]    with these constraints in mind , and having established the parametrization and interpolation of the @xmath8 distributions as discussed above , one may now proceed to the attempt at sorting the 19 available experiments into a consistent global data set .",
    "it would of course be rather surprising if all experiments would fit into this global picture within their respective error limits .",
    "in fact it turns out that this procedure establishes a very strong constraint for possible deviations , as a large majority of results is creating a perfectly consistent picture both for protons and for pions .",
