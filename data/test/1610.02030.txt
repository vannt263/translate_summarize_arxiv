    "we are entering a golden age for milky way astronomy .",
    "the european space agency ( esa ) s @xmath4 mission @xcite , which launched @xmath5 december 2013 , has recently published its first data release @xcite , giving us a new window on our galaxy , and in particular , the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the primary astrometric catalogue in _",
    "gaia_-dr1 is the tycho-@xmath4 astrometric solution ( tgas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which uses data from the @xmath6 - 2 catalogue @xcite , to provide a baseline of approximately 30 years upon which to calculate astrometric values for stars in common between @xmath6 - 2 and @xmath4 .",
    "there is also significant overlap between stars in the tgas catalogue and stars observed by the radial velocity experiment ( rave , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , enabling the full 6-dimensional phase space information to be known for over 200,000 stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this enables us to explore local dynamics in unprecedented detail .",
    "many aspects of the structure and dynamics of the milky way are difficult to measure , owing to our position within the galaxy , and complex observational selection effects such as dust extinction .",
    "thus , many of the fundamental parameters of the milky way carry significant uncertainty .",
    "one such parameter is the velocity at which the sun rotates around the galaxy , for which plausible values span the range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are dependent on the data set and technique used .",
    "@xcite proposed that the rotation velocity of the sun may be measured by searching for a lack of stars exhibiting zero angular momentum .",
    "stars with zero angular momenta are expected to plunge into the galactic nucleus and subsequently experience scattering onto chaotic orbits with a high scale height , henceforth spending the majority of their time in the stellar halo @xcite .",
    "if stars with very low angular momentum are indeed not present in the solar neighbourhood , the tail of the tangential velocity distribution will exhibit a dip centred at the solar reflex value .",
    "this method for measuring the solar velocity is attractive because it should depend only on the existence of low angular momentum orbits within the milky way s disk . with 6-dimensional phase space measurements for nearby stars",
    "it becomes possible to calculate the tangential velocity distribution with respect to the sun , and thus we can test this prediction by searching for a dearth of stars around the assumed value of the negative of the solar motion .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows . in section [ sec : observation ] we discuss our treatment of the data , and the feature observed in the resulting velocity distribution . in section [ sec : modeling ]",
    "we present simulated models which can explain the feature and make predictions for the size and shape of the observed feature . in section [ sec : detection ]",
    "we fit our model to the data and present our measurement of @xmath9 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss the implications of the detection and look forward to future measurements .",
    "we cross match the tgas catalogue @xcite and the rave dr5 data @xcite to add rave line - of - sight velocities to the tgas astrometric data . where available , we employ the rave spectrophotometric distance estimates , because estimating distances from the tgas parallax is non - trivial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , where no rave distance is available , we naively invert the tgas parallax @xmath10 to obtain distance estimates for the remaining stars , removing any star with @xmath11 to avoid large distance uncertainties .",
    "the resulting sample consists of 216,201 stars with 6-dimensional phase - space measurements .",
    "then , we convert the velocities from equatorial coordinates to standard galactic cartesian coordinates centred on the sun , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 positive in the direction of the galactic centre ( toward galactic longitude @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 positive in the direction of galactic rotation ( toward @xmath16 ) , both measured with respect to the sun .",
    "( img )   for stars observed to be within 700 pc of the sun .",
    "the sun s velocity has @xmath17 .",
    "the low - velocity tail of the distribution displays a clear dip in the range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 that is marked with an arrow and overlaid with an exponential for illustration . *",
    "bottom panel : * normalised kde of the above distribution clearly showing the dip.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] ; ; ; ;    figure  [ fig : disp ] shows the distribution of @xmath15 for stars within 700 pc as a histogram ( top panel ) and with kernel density estimation ( e.g. , @xcite ; bottom panel ) using a gaussian kernel with bandwidth 9 .",
    "we chose 700 pc as a balance between quantity of stars , and quality of data .",
    "there is a clear underdensity of stars in the approximate region of @xmath18 to @xmath19 , marked with an arrow ( see also the top panel of figure  [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "although there are only @xmath20 stars per bin at these velocities , this dip in the distribution is clear across @xmath21 bins .",
    "we defer a discussion of the significance of the dip until section 4 where we fit a model for the dip obtained from simulations .",
    "furthermore , in the two - dimensional distribution of @xmath22 , we find a lack of stars with both positive @xmath13 and large negative @xmath15 .",
    "that is , there are very few stars observed on disk orbits ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) plunging towards the galactic centre .",
    "quantitatively , there are 24 stars with @xmath25 in the range @xmath26 and 34 stars with @xmath27",
    ". these rates are inconsistent with being drawn from the same distribution at @xmath28 .",
    "our analysis does not explicitly take into account the uncertainties on the distance or velocity estimates . propagating the uncertainties through the coordinate transformation results in an uncertainty of approximately 10 per cent on the measured cartesian velocities . at the @xmath15 range of the dip",
    ", this corresponds to uncertainties of approximately @xmath29 .",
    "because the width of the dip feature appears to be approximately @xmath30 we can neglect the uncertainties in this initial investigation .",
    "a likely explanation for these missing stars , as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , is that they have been scattered onto chaotic orbits with larger scale heights by interaction with the galactic nucleus .",
    "this is expected for disk stars with approximately zero angular momentum as discussed in @xcite .",
    "thus , as these stars would then spend the majority of their orbits far from the galactic plane , it is very unlikely that they would be observed in the solar neighbourhood at any one given time . in galactocentric coordinates , such stars have tangential velocities @xmath31 , corresponding to heliocentric @xmath32 , minus the solar tangential velocity measured in the galactocentric frame .",
    "@xcite performed an analysis of this effect and matched models of the dip constructed within an analytic potential to data from local stellar catalogues complete to 25 pc .",
    "they found the dip to be centred at @xmath33 , with a depth greater than 80% .",
    "however , they are careful to note that there are only 18 stars with @xmath34 and that a larger sample will improve the measurement .",
    "the tgas+rave sample used here has 374 stars with @xmath35 , allowing far greater confidence in our subsequent analysis of the feature .",
    "firstly , we make a fresh prediction of the feature which we expect to observe in the tgas data , similar to @xcite , but with an updated potential , and drawing the distribution of initial positions , radial , and vertical velocities from the observed data to tailor the prediction to the current data set . it is challenging to construct an @xmath36-body model with sufficient resolution to predict the high velocity tail in the local neighbourhood .",
    "thus , we integrate test particles in a milky - way like potential , and observe the resulting orbits .    for our milky - way potential we use",
    "` mwpotential2014 ` from ` galpy ` @xcite . `",
    "mwpotential2014 ` consists of a power - law spherical bulge potential with an exponential cut - off , a miyamoto - nagai disk potential , and a nfw halo potential .",
    "the parameters of this potential have been fit to a wide variety of dynamical data in the milky way ; the full parameters are given in @xcite .",
    "to model the hard galactic nucleus that is not included in ` mwpotential2014 ` , we also include a plummer potential @xmath37 , where @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 pc .",
    "note that we do not include a non - axisymmetric bar potential in this initial work , which may affect the feature slightly .",
    "this should be considered when applying this technique to future @xmath4 data releases .",

    "the top panel shows the orbit of a star with @xmath43 , which exhibits chaotic behaviour upon interaction with the galactic nucleus .",
    "the middle and lower panels show the orbits of stars with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , which exhibit well - behaved disk orbits .",
    "the star with no angular momentum spends little of its orbital period near the galactic plane , whereas the two stars which do not approach the nucleus remain within a few hundred parsecs of the plane .    without an ab - initio model for the disc , it is difficult to predict how many stars are expected to be missing near zero angular momentum and what the exact profile of the dip should be .",
    "therefore , we use the fraction of the orbital period of the test - particle stars that they spend near the mid - plane of the disc as a proxy for whether it has been scattered to a much higher scale height .",
    "we integrate many orbits with positions , radial , and vertical velocities drawn from the tgas+rave sample and from an initial , uniform distribution in @xmath15 covering the low - velocity tail .",
    "we then re - weight the stars using the fraction of time they spend near the plane and construct the dip profile by dividing this weighted , final @xmath15 distribution by the initial , uniform distribution .",

    "it is clear that the shape and depth of the overlaid distributions are very similar and thus not dependent on the value of the solar motion .",
    "the dip profile is not entirely symmetric around zero @xmath54 , because the spatial distribution of the tgas+rave sample is asymmetric around the sun .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : dips ] displays the same as the upper panel , for @xmath55 , but assuming @xmath56 kpc to weight the orbits .",

    "we create a function @xmath60 of the dip by smoothly interpolating the model with @xmath55 and @xmath53 pc displayed in the top panel of figure  [ fig : dips ] . because the dip profile computed above is an approximation ,",

    "this clearly demonstrates the dearth of stars between approximately @xmath69 and @xmath19 when compared with the exponential model .",
    "the best - fitting dip model is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fit ] .",
    "the data prefer a dip : the log likelihood of the best - fit model is @xmath70 , compared with @xmath71 for the best - fit exponential model with two fewer parameters ( @xmath72 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also fit a model where we allow the width to be controlled by a new parameter @xmath73 that stretches the profile in figure  [ fig : dips ] along the @xmath74 axis . for this model",
    "we find @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "although the likelihood is marginally higher for this model , the significance of the detection is lower owing to the extra free parameter .    using the akaike information criterion ( aic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the difference in ln likelihood corresponds to a @xmath77 detection for the @xmath78 model and a @xmath79 detection for the @xmath73 free case . when combined with the @xmath80 detection from the @xmath13 to @xmath15 analysis using a bonferroni correction to account for the multiple tests ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this gives a @xmath81 detection for @xmath78 and a @xmath82 detection when @xmath73 is left free .",

    "we have shown that a dip in the low - velocity tail of stars in the solar neighborhood is present at @xmath81 significance .",
    "this feature can be plausibly explained by the absence of stars on orbits with approximately zero angular momentum , due to such stars being scattered onto halo orbits after interaction with the galactic nucleus as predicted by @xcite . using orbit integration in a realistic model of the galactic potential",
    ", we have demonstrated that this dip should be centered on minus the solar rotational velocity @xmath88 . in this way",
    ", we were able to measure @xmath89 .",
    "our modeling does not include the galactic bar or spiral arms , which affect the orbits of stars .",
    "however , because the dip is due to zero - angular momentum stars moving on orbits that are highly eccentric that are being lost from the solar neighborhood over many dynamical times , the gravitational perturbations and current position of the relatively diffuse stellar bar and of the spiral structure should not greatly affect the profile of the dip and we expect their effect to be minor on our derived value of @xmath9 .",
    "observations of the galactic center have precisely measured the proper motion @xmath90 of sgr a@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "assuming that sgr a@xmath2 is at rest with respect to the dynamical center of the milky way , this apparent proper motion is due to the reflex motion of the sun .",
    "the ratio of the linear and angular measurements of the reflex motion of the sun @xmath91 then becomes a measurement of the distance @xmath92 to the galactic centre . for @xmath93",
    ", our measurement of @xmath9 implies @xmath94 .",
    "this is an essentially dynamical measurement of @xmath92 . if the lack of zero angular momentum stars is confirmed in future _",
    "gaia _ data releases and systematics can be controlled , this feature can in principle saturate the precision implied by the uncertainty in @xmath90 , which is @xmath95 .",
    "future @xmath4 data releases will have many orders of magnitude more stars , with substantially higher accuracy on the measured parameters . additionally , future @xmath4 data releases will contain line - of - sight velocities for stars in the solar neighbourhood , removing the asymmetry in the sample introduce by the necessity to cross match with rave .",
    "thus , with future @xmath4 data releases we hope that this technique may provide a very precise measurement of the solar reflex motion with respect to the galactic centre .",
    "we can make a rough prediction for the strength of the feature expected in future @xmath4 data releases by using the @xmath4 object generator ( gog , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the @xmath4 universe model snapshot ( gums , * ? ?",
    "gog predicts that approximately 17.5 million stars will be observed with radial velocities within 700 pc , and thus , by weighting that number by the fraction of stars in the tail compared to the full sample matched with rave , e.g. 374/216,201=0.0017 , we can predict that @xmath4 will observe roughly 30,000 stars in the tail within 700 pc .",
    "this should allow us to confirm the existence of this feature , and if present allow us to increase the precision of the measurement of @xmath9 to within approximately @xmath96 , assuming the errors decrease on the order of @xmath97 . in turn the error on @xmath92 would become dominated by the error in the proper motion measurement . at this level",
    "the systematics will then become extremely important , and in future analysis we must take into consideration other factors such as the bar , spiral structure and local giant molecular clouds , although the tangential deflections are expected to be small .",
    "further work is also needed to fully determine the origin of this feature , and to make more detailed predictions on the shape and depth which we expect to observe .",
    "the exact dimensions of the feature are likely slightly dependent on the potential of the inner galaxy , and thus matching the observed shape in future @xmath4 data releases to dip functions constructed from various models for the potential may give us valuable insight into the potential of the inner galaxy .",
