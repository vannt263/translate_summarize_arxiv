    "the properties of the kaons and antikaons in the nuclear medium have been the object of numerous investigations since the possibility of the existence of a kaon condensed phase in dense nuclear matter was pointed out @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath0 yield in ni+ni collisions measured recently by the kaos collaboration at gsi @xcite can be explained by assuming the @xmath0 meson to feel a strong attraction in the medium @xcite .",
    "kaonic atom data , a compilation of which is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , also favor an attractive @xmath0 nucleus interaction .",
    "most of the recent theoretical works start from chiral lagrangians that reproduce the free space scattering properties which , in the case of @xmath8 scattering , are dominated by the presence of an isospin zero resonance , the @xmath6 .",
    "it is precisely the influence of this resonance what makes the @xmath9 interaction repulsive at threshold , while the lowest order born s - wave amplitude from the chiral lagrangian ( the tomozawa - weinberg term ) is attractive .",
    "evidently , one can not expect chiral perturbation theory to work close to a resonance .",
    "this is why all works studying the free space @xmath10 interaction from the chiral lagrangian either introduce the @xmath6 as an elementary field @xcite or generate it dynamically through the lippmann - schwinger @xcite or the bethe - salpeter @xcite equations .",
    "these latter approaches allow for a microscopic incorporation of the medium effects on the the @xmath5 interaction @xcite .",
    "for instance , pauli blocking on the intermediate nucleon states , makes the @xmath5 interaction density dependent and this , in turn , modifies the @xmath0 properties from those in free space .",
    "these medium modifications were already included long time ago in the context of brueckner - type many body theory @xcite to obtain the kaon - nucleus optical potential for kaonic atoms .",
    "the medium properties of kaons and antikaons have also been obtained from mean field theories , built within the framework of chiral lagrangians @xcite , based on the relativistic walecka - type model extended to incorporate strangeness in the form of hyperons or kaons @xcite , or using explicitly quark degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "all the different approaches agree qualitatively in establishing that , in the medium , the @xmath11 feels a moderate repulsion and the @xmath0 a strong attraction . how large is this attraction is still somewhat controversial .",
    "recent phenomenological approaches @xcite based on fits to kaonic atom data find a @xmath0-nucleus potential of the order of @xmath12 mev in the nuclear center .",
    "however , no calculation that starts from the bare @xmath13 interaction predicts such an attraction , the values ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 mev .",
    "hopefully , heavy - ion reactions , that are sensitive to higher density regions , will help in elucidating these discrepancies . at the same time , it is necessary to develop theories that treat the intricacies associated to the mutual interaction between all the hadrons in the medium as accurately as possible .    in the present work",
    "we perform a microscopic study of the the @xmath0 properties in nuclear matter by incorporating the medium modifications on the @xmath5 amplitude using the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was shown to reproduce the @xmath9 scattering observables very satisfactorily .",
    "as mentioned above , one source of density dependence is the pauli blocking on the nucleon states .",
    "this makes the @xmath5 interaction attractive and , on the other hand , shifts the resonance to higher energies @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown recently @xcite that a self - consistent calculation of the @xmath0 self - energy leaves the position of the resonance unchanged , due to a compensation of the repulsive @xmath6 shift with the attraction felt by the @xmath0 meson",
    ". the importance of these medium effects makes it interesting to investigate other medium modifications of the particles participating in building up the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "this is the aim of the present work . to this end",
    ", we include , in addition , the dressing of the pions in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 intermediate states , which couple strongly to the @xmath18 state .",
    "this is done through a pion self - energy that contains the effect of one- and two - nucleon absorption , conveniently modified to include the effect of nuclear short - range correlations .",

    "this implies a rapid transition from a repulsive @xmath5 interaction to an attractive one as density increases and a microscopic study of the @xmath0 properties in the medium can not be done in terms of the simple @xmath68 or impulse approximation .",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider the density dependence of the in - medium @xmath5 interaction , @xmath70 .",
    "one source of density dependence comes from the pauli principle , which prevents the scattering to intermediate nucleon states below the fermi momentum , @xmath71 . to incorporate this effect in the channels having an intermediate nucleon state",

    "this can be understood in the following way : the @xmath192 channel is one of the important building blocks of the @xmath6 strength below the @xmath1 threshold . when the pions are dressed in the medium they couple strongly to @xmath155 and @xmath158 components , so that the @xmath0 is effectively coupling to intermediate @xmath193 , @xmath194 states with lower threshold than the @xmath192 channel . actually , the opening of this latter channel on top of the already existing @xmath193 and @xmath194 is visible through a cusp in @xmath195 around @xmath196 mev .",
    "the effect on the @xmath0 self - energy of the baryon binding potentials is basically a shift in the scale of energies , corresponding to the difference of potentials between the nucleon and the @xmath94 hyperon , which amounts to 20 mev at @xmath176 .",
    "the scattering properties of a @xmath4 in the nuclear medium will depend on the characteristics of the in - medium @xmath5 scattering amplitude .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to see if the resonant shape of the free @xmath8 scattering amplitude remains when the medium effects are incorporated .",
    "[ fig : ampltot ] shows the real part ( on the left ) and imaginary part ( on the right ) of the @xmath197 scattering amplitude for a total momentum @xmath198 as a function of @xmath199 .",
    "results are shown for several densities and for the three types of approximations .",
    "on the top panels we can see how , as density increases , the pauli blocking effects merely shift the resonance to higher energies , hence changing from being 27 mev below the @xmath8 threshold to being above it from a certain density on .",
    "note , however , that the resonance still appears , for each density , below the new threshold imposed by the pauli principle , i.e. @xmath200 . on the other hand , the resonance shape remains pretty much unaltered .",
    "when the dressing of the @xmath4 meson is also incorporated , we observe how the resonant shape smears out quite fast with increasing density .",
    "moreover , the resonance does not move up to higher energies but stays close to the free space value due to a cancellation between the repulsive pauli blocking effects and the attractive medium effects on the @xmath4 .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the self - consistent calculation of lutz @xcite , although we seem to observe a faster dilution of the resonance with the medium density .",
    "finally , when the in - medium dressing of the pions are also included we obtain a quite similar pattern .",
    "the resonance dissolves very fast although it shows a tendency to move to higher energies .",
    "the isospin averaged in - medium scattering length defined as @xmath201 with @xmath202 , is shown if fig .",
    "[ fig : scatlen ] .",
    "the change of @xmath203 from negative to positive values indicates the transition from a repulsive interaction in free space to an attractive interaction in the medium .",
    "as shown by the dotted line , this transition happens at a density of about @xmath204 when only pauli effects are considered , in agreement with what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , this transition occurs at even lower densities ( @xmath205 ) when one considers the dressing of the mesons in the description , as seen from the dashed ( _ in - medium kaons _ ) and full ( _ in - medium pions and kaons _ )",
    "lines . the deviations from the approach including only pauli blocking or those dressing the mesons are quite appreaciable over a wide range of densities .",
    "the effective @xmath0 mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emass ] as a function of @xmath206 for the different approximations .",
    "note that the effective mass , defined as the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) for @xmath207 , gives the position of the @xmath0 pole peak in the spectral function assuming a weak energy dependence of @xmath208 .",
    "in addition , one can only think of the @xmath209 as a quasi - meson moving with the modified @xmath210 mass if the spectral function shows a clear and narrow enough @xmath0 pole peak , which happens when @xmath211 is sufficiently small . by looking at the @xmath0 spectral function of fig .",
    "[ fig : specka ] one sees that these conditions are not always fulfilled , especially when the dressing of the mesons is incorporated . keeping this in mind",
    ", we can still analyze the effective mass as a simplified way to assess how important is the attraction felt by the @xmath0 meson in the medium .",
    "morover , this analysis will allow to compare our results with those obtained by other calculations . as can be seen in the zoomed area on the top right of the figure , the in - medium @xmath0 mass increases slightly from the free value but quickly gains attraction as density increases .",
    "the transition from repulsion to attraction occurs around @xmath212 for the _ pauli _ approximation ( dotted line ) while the two other approximations that incorporate the dressing of the @xmath4 ( dashed line ) and also that of the pion ( full line ) show attraction already at around @xmath213 .",
    "however , the density dependence is stronger with the _ pauli _ approximation which gives rise to a lower value of @xmath210 from @xmath214 onwards .",
    "it turns out that , in spite of the essentially different shapes of the @xmath0 spectral function , the position of the @xmath0 pole is very similar for the _ pauli _ and the _ in - medium kaons _",
    "approximations for densities higher than @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , the calculated effective masses decrease similarly",
    ". however , when the dressing of the pions is also included , the attraction is substantially more moderate and the effective mass seems to level off at high densities around the value achieved already at @xmath69 of @xmath215 mev .",
    "this would correspond to a @xmath0 optical potential of @xmath216 mev .",
    "pauli _ and _ in - medium kaons _",
    "approximations give rise to a a more attractive value of the effective mass at @xmath69 , namely @xmath217 mev which corresponds to a @xmath218 mev .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all the calculations , either microscopic @xcite or based on mean field theories @xcite predict effective masses at @xmath69 which range between 375 mev and 425 mev .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 potential at the center of the nucleus would then be in between @xmath14 and @xmath15 mev .",
    "therefore , no theory is able to explain the large attraction of @xmath219 obtained from the best available fit to kaonic atom data @xcite .",
    "however , we should warn that the data of @xmath0 atoms are only sensitive to the @xmath0 self - energy at the low effective densities felt by the kaons that explore basically the nuclear surface .",
    "the values obtained by the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath176 are an extrapolation of a preassumed functional dependence on @xmath166 .",
    "it is possible to obtain equally good fits with other functionals that give the same value for the low densities explored by the kaons but different extrapolations at @xmath176 .",
    "in fact , quite good fits to the @xmath0 atoms data are also obtained with the batty potential of ref .",
    "@xcite which is of the order of @xmath220 mev .",
    "we also note that the brueckner - type calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a shallow @xmath0-nucleus potential , of the order of @xmath221 mev at the center of @xmath222c , and predicted reasonably well the data available at that time .    with the values",
    "obtained here for @xmath210 and similar ones that we obtain for neutron matter the phenomenon of @xmath0 condensation appears very unlikely , since there is not enough attraction for the @xmath0 energy to become smaller than the electron chemical potential in beta stable neutron star matter .",
    "the implications of our results for the in - medium @xmath0 self - energy on kaonic atoms is currently being analyzed @xcite and gives results compatible with the existing kaonic atom data .",
    "that analysis , based on a local density approximation , requires the knowledge of the optical potential , defined as @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the on - shell momentum value that fulfills eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) for a given value of @xmath106 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential for the _ in - medium pions and kaons _ approximation are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : optpotpika ] for three energy values : @xmath225 mev ( dotted line ) , @xmath226 ( solid line ) and @xmath227 mev ( dashed line ) .",
    "the self - energy shown by the solid lines is the relevant one for studies of low lying @xmath0 atomic states , while the results displayed by the dotted line would be the ones to use for very deeply bound states in the pb region .",
    "the dashed lines show an example of the @xmath0 optical potential at positive energies and would be the one to consider to treat the @xmath0 distortions in @xmath0-nucleus scattering reactions around 25 mev .",
    "while the real part of the optical potential becomes less attractive with increasing energy , the imaginary part does not show a too strong energy dependence in the range of energies explored .",
    "this behavior can be easily inferred from the @xmath0 self - energies shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : selftot ] .",
    "in this work we have studied the @xmath0 properties in nuclear matter using a chiral unitary approach for the @xmath13 interaction in s - wave that incorporates the medium effects microscopically .",
    "pauli blocking acting on the intermediate nucleon states modifies the @xmath13 interaction from that in free space and gives rise to a @xmath0 spectral function that shows two distinctive peaks at very low density .",
    "the lower one corresponds to the the position of the new @xmath0 pole , located below the @xmath0 mass from already quite low densities on , which indicates that the @xmath0 feels an attraction in the medium .",
    "the higher peak is associated to the in - medium @xmath6 resonance that appears above the free @xmath228 threshold due to the repulsive effect induced by blocking the intermediate nucleon states below the fermi momentum . as density increases",
    ", the @xmath0 feels more attraction and the @xmath6 keeps moving to higher energies .    when the @xmath0 self - energy is incorporated self - consistently into the scheme , there is a compensation between the attraction felt by the @xmath0 and the repulsive pauli blocking shift . as a result , the resonance appears at a similar location as that in free space .",
    "however , its width is much larger and it tends to dissolve with increasing density due to a weaker in - medium @xmath13 interaction which now is determined from dressed @xmath4 propagators which are more spread out over energies .    in the present work",
    "we also include the dressing of the pions in the intermediate @xmath229 , @xmath192 states to which the @xmath230 system can couple .",
    "we use a pion self - energy that includes the coupling to @xmath155 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 excitations modified by the effect of short - range @xmath231 correlations .",
    "the fact that now the pions also have a spreading width makes the in - medium @xmath230 interaction even smoother .",
    "the @xmath0 feels less attraction and the @xmath6 resonance , which is shifted slighty upwards from its free space position , dissolves even faster with density .",
    "our approach gives rise to a @xmath0 self - energy at normal nuclear density which has about half the attraction of that obtained with other theories and approximation schemes and would make the phenomenon of kaon condensation very unlikely .",
    "the self - energy obtained is , however , compatible with the existing data on kaonic atoms .",
