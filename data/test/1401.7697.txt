    "partial differential equations posed on surfaces arise in mathematical models for many natural phenomena : diffusion along grain boundaries @xcite , lipid interactions in biomembranes @xcite , and transport of surfactants on multiphase flow interfaces @xcite , as well as in many engineering and bioscience applications : vector field visualization @xcite , textures synthesis @xcite , brain warping @xcite , fluids in lungs @xcite among others .",
    "thus , recently there has been a significant increase of interest in developing and analyzing numerical methods for pdes on surfaces .",
    "one natural approach to solving pdes on surfaces numerically is based on surface triangulation . in this class of methods ,",
    "one typically assumes that a parametrization of a surface is given and the surface is approximated by a family of consistent regular triangulations .",
    "it is common to assume that all nodes of the triangulations lie on the surface .",
    "the analysis of a finite element method based on surface triangulations was first done in  @xcite . to avoid surface triangulation and remeshing ( if the surface evolves ) ,",
    "another approach was taken in @xcite : it was proposed to extend a partial differential equation from the surface to a set of positive lebesgue measure in @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting pde is then solved in one dimension higher , but can be solved on a mesh that is unaligned to the surface .",
    "a surface is allowed to be defined implicitly as a zero set of a given level set function .",
    "however , the resulting bulk elliptic or parabolic equations are degenerate , with no diffusion acting in the direction normal to the surface .",
    "a version of the method , where only an @xmath3-narrow band around the surface is used to define a finite element method , was studied in @xcite .",
    "a fairly complete overview of finite element methods for surface pdes and more references can be found in the recent review paper  @xcite .    for an elliptic equation on a compact hypersurface",
    ", the present paper considers a new extended non - degenerate formulation , which is uniformly elliptic in a bulk domain containing the surface .",
    "we analyze a galerkin finite element method for solving the extended equation .",
    "the bulk domain is allowed to be a narrow band around the surface with width proportional to a mesh size .",
    "thus the number of degrees of freedom used in computations stays asymptotically optimal , when the mesh size decreases .",
    "the finite element method we apply here is unfitted : the mesh does not respect the surface or the boundary of the narrow band .",
    "this property is important from the practical point of view .",
    "no parametrization of the surface is required by the method .",
    "the surface can be given implicitly and the implementation requires only an approximation of its distance function .",
    "we analyse the approximation properties of the method and prove error estimates for finite element solutions in the bulk domain and restricted to the surface .",
    "the analysis allows finite elements of higher order and gives sufficient conditions for archiving optimal convergence order in the energy norm .",
    "we remark that up to date the analysis of higher order finite element methods for surface pdes is largely an open problem : in @xcite a higher order extension of the method from @xcite was analysed under the assumption that a parametrization of @xmath4 is known .",
    "the analysis of a coupled surface - bulk problem from @xcite also admits a higher order discretization by isoparametric finite elements on a triangulation fitted to a given surface .",
    "another unfitted finite element method for elliptic equations posed on surfaces was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "that method does not use an extension of the surface partial differential equation .",
    "it is instead based on a restriction ( trace ) of the outer finite element spaces to a surface .",
    "we do not compare these two different approaches in the paper .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s_prel ] collects some necessary definitions and preliminary results . in section  [ s_form ] ,",
    "we recall the extended pde approach from @xcite and introduce a different non - degenerate extended formulation . in section  [ s_fem ] , we consider a finite element method .",
    "finite element method error analysis is presented in section  [ s_error ] .",

    "we define @xmath52 thus , @xmath53 is the extension of @xmath51 along normals on @xmath4 , it satisfies @xmath54 in @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath55 is constant along normals to @xmath4 . computing the gradient of @xmath56 and using and gives @xmath57 for higher order derivatives , assume the surface is sufficiently smooth @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",

    "in this section , we review some well - known results for numerical methods based on surface pdes extensions and define a suitable extension of the surface equation to a neighborhood of  @xmath4 .      in @xcite bertalmio et al .",
    "suggested to extend a pde off a surface to every level set of the indicator function @xmath31 in some neighborhood of @xmath4 . applied to this leads to the problem posed in @xmath25 : @xmath71 the corresponding weak formulation of was shown to be well - posed in @xcite .",
    "the weak solution is sought in the anisotropic space @xmath72 on every level set of @xmath31 the solution to does not depend on a data in a neighborhood of this level set .",
    "indeed , the diffusion in acts only in the direction tangential to level sets of @xmath31 and one may consider as a collection of of independent surface problems posed on every level set .",
    "hence , the surface equation is embedded in and if a smooth solution to exists , then restricted to @xmath4 it solves the original laplace - beltrami problem . with no ambiguity",
    ", we shall denote by @xmath17 both the solutions to surface and extended problems .",
    "the major numerical advantage of any extended formulation is that one may apply standard discretization methods to solve equations in the volume domain @xmath25 and further take the trace of computed solutions on @xmath4 ( or on a approximation of @xmath4 ) .",
    "computational experiments from @xcite suggest that these traces of numerical solutions are reasonably good approximations to the solution of the surface problem .",
    "numerical analysis of surface equations discretization methods based on extensions is by far not completed : error estimates for finite element methods for were shown in  @xcite .",
    "error estimate in @xcite was established in the integral volume norm @xmath73 rather than in a surface norm for @xmath4 . in @xcite ,",
    "a finite element method based on triangulations not fitted to the curvilinear boundary of @xmath25 was studied .",
    "the first order convergence was proved in the surface @xmath74 norm , if the band width @xmath49 in is of the order of mesh size and if a quasi - uniform triangulation of @xmath5 is assumed . for linear elements",
    "this estimate is of the optimal order in energy norm .",
    "the extended formulation is numerically convenient , but has a number of potential issues , as noted already in @xcite and reviewed in @xcite .",
    "no boundary conditions are needed for , if the boundary of the bulk domain @xmath25 consists of level sets of @xmath31 . however some auxiliary boundary conditions are often required by a numerical method .",
    "the extended equation is defined in a domain in one dimension higher than the surface equation .",
    "this leads to involving extra degrees of freedom in computations .",
    "if @xmath25 is a narrow band around @xmath4 , then handling numerical boundary conditions may effect the quality of the discrete solution .",
    "finally , the second order term in the extended formulation is degenerate , since no diffusion acts in the direction normal to level sets of @xmath31 . the current understanding of numerical methods for degenerate elliptic and parabolic equations is still limited .",
    "an improvement to the original extension of surface pdes was introduced by greer in  @xcite .",
    "greer suggested to use the non - orthogonal scaled projection operator @xmath75 on tangential planes of the level sets of @xmath31 instead of @xmath76 . for a smooth @xmath4 , one can always consider small enough @xmath26 such that @xmath77 is well defined in @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath31 is the singed distance function and all data ( @xmath78 and @xmath21 for equations ) is extended to the neighborhood of @xmath4 according to , i.e. constant along normals , then one can easily show ( see @xcite ) that the solution to the new extended equation is constant in normal directions : @xmath79 the property is crucial , since it allows to add diffusion in the normal direction without altering solution .",
    "doing this , one obtains a non - degenerated elliptic operator .",
    "thus , for solving the heat equation on a surface , it was suggested in @xcite to include the additional term @xmath80 in the extended formulation with a coefficient @xmath81 . for the planar case , @xmath82 ,",
    "the recommendation was to set @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the curvature of @xmath4 ( @xmath4 is a curve in the planar case ) .      here",
    "we deduce another extension of : let @xmath31 be the signed distance function and @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the normal extensions to @xmath78 and @xmath21 .",
