    "this extreme planet is in a 1.3 day polar orbit around an f6v host star , with a semimajor axis of 0.025au .",

    "these properties , combined with the brightness of the host star ( @xmath13mag ) , make wasp-121b an excellent target for atmospheric characterization .",

    "integration times were 103 seconds , using the spars10 readout mode .",
    "a scan rate of 0.12 arcsec / sec was adopted , giving scans along 100 pixel rows of the cross - dispersion axis for each exposure .",
    "typical count levels remained below @xmath15 electrons , well within the linear regime of the detector .",
    "exposures were taken contiguously over five _",
    "hst _ orbits , with 17 exposures obtained per orbit .",
    "the first orbit allowed the telescope to settle into its new pointing position , and was discarded during the lightcurve analysis due to the large amplitude instrumental systematics it exhibited , as is standard practice for exoplanet transit observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "of the remaining four _ hst _ orbits , the first and fourth provided out - of - transit baseline , while the second and third occurred during the transit .",

    "we extracted flux for wasp-121 from each exposure by taking the difference between successive non - destructive reads .",
    "for each read difference , we removed the background by taking the median flux in a box of pixels well away from the stellar spectra .",

    "the wavelength solution was determined by cross - correlating the first spectrum , with dispersion 4.64nm / pixel , against an atlas stellar model @xcite with properties similar to wasp-121 ( @xmath16k , @xmath17cgs , @xmath18km / s ) modulated by the throughput of the g141 grism . prior to cross - correlation",
    ", both the measured spectrum and atlas spectrum were smoothed using a gaussian filter with full - width half maximum of 20 nm . as a result , the cross - correlation was most sensitive to the steep edges of the g141 response curve , rather than individual stellar lines .",
    "we repeated this process for all remaining spectra to determine shifts along the dispersion axis over the course of the observations , which were found to be within 0.23 pixels .",
    "white lightcurves were generated for each trial aperture by summing the flux for each spectrum along the dispersion axis .",

    "spectroscopic lightcurves were produced using a similar approach to @xcite .",
    "first , a reference spectrum was produced by taking the average of the out - of - transit spectra .",
    "each individual spectrum was then shifted laterally in wavelength and stretched vertically in flux to match the reference spectrum , using linear least squares .",
    "the residuals of these fits were binned into 28 spectroscopic channels across the @xmath6@xmath45 wavelength range , each spanning 4 columns of the dispersion axis .",
    "the spectroscopic residuals were then added to a transit signal with @xmath19 and @xmath21 set to the white lightcurve best - fit values ( table [ table : white_lightcurve ] ) , and limb darkening appropriate to the wavelength channel , giving the final spectroscopic lightcurves shown in figure [ fig : spectroscopic_lightcurves ] .",
    "this process reduces systematics that are common - mode in wavelength , as well as those arising due to the spectra drifting along the dispersion axis .",
    "it retains , however , channel - to - channel differences in the flux level , including possible transit depth variations caused by the wavelength - dependent opacity of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "we fit the spectroscopic lightcurves using the same gp treatment described above for the white lightcurve . for these fits ,",
    "@xmath19 was allowed to vary separately for each channel , while @xmath21 was held fixed to the best - fit white lightcurve value .",
    "again , a nonlinear limb darkening law was used with coefficients fixed to the values reported in table [ table : spectroscopic_lightcurves ] , which were determined using the same method described in section [ sec : data_reduction ] for the white lightcurve .",

    "the wfc3 data show structure , with two broad features centered around @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the scale of these variations is on the order of a few atmospheric scale heights , consistent with expectations for molecular absorption .",
    "additionally , the effective planetary radius is found to be significantly larger at optical wavelengths relative to near - infrared wavelengths .    before exploring implications for the planetary atmosphere , we considered the possibility of stellar activity causing the different radii measured at optical and near - infrared wavelengths . making the conservative assumption that star spots are non - luminous",
    ", we calculate that the unocculted spot coverage would need to decrease by an amount equivalent to 7% of the visible stellar disc between the optical and near - infrared observation epochs .",

    ", we varied the relative abundances of tio / h@xmath196o , vo / h@xmath196o , and fe / h@xmath196o during fitting .",
    "solar abundances under thermochemical equilibrium were adopted for other gas species , including h@xmath196o .",
    "we note that for transmission spectra , the absolute abundances of individual species are often unconstrained owing to a well - known degeneracy with the absolute pressure level , but the relative abundances between species can be well measured . in our fitting , tio / vo / feh abundances were adjusted using the analytical relation of for the wavelength - dependent transit radius of an isothermal atmosphere . we also considered a simple haze scattering model in the form of a rayleigh profile with collisional cross - section area allowed to vary as a free parameter , as described in @xcite .",
    "best fits for a number of illustrative models are shown in figure [ fig : transmission_spectrum ] , obtained using the nonlinear least squares idl routine ` mpfit ` @xcite .",
    "we find that a model excluding tio , vo , feh , and haze is unable to account for the data ( purple line ) .",

    "the strong absorption of tio and vo in the optical accounts for the larger radii measured at these wavelengths relative to the near - infrared . to illustrate the effect of feh",
    ", we also generated a model with it removed , but tio and vo retained ( orange line ) .",
    "such a model is unable to reproduce the wfc3 transmission spectrum at wavelengths near @xmath7 , where feh has prominent absorption .",
    "lastly , a model excluding tio , vo , and feh , but including haze , gives a relatively poor fit to the data ( green line ) .",
    "most significantly , haze scattering underpredicts the @xmath201 opacity by @xmath202 . to assess the relative quality of fit between the haze and tio / vo / feh models , we computed the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) for each , obtaining @xmath203 for the haze model and @xmath204 for the tio / vo / feh model .",
    "following @xcite , we approximate the bayes factor as @xmath205 in favor of the tio / vo / feh model over the haze model .",
    "this strongly supports the hypothesis that tio and vo , rather than haze , are responsible for the enhanced opacity measured at optical wavelengths .",
    "all models favor h@xmath196o absorption , which matches the measured spectrum well between @xmath206@xmath207 . to quantify the significance of this detection",

    "our observations reveal h@xmath196o absorption in the atmosphere of wasp-121b with an amplitude of @xmath208 gas pressure scale heights .",
    "this result is consistent with a clear atmosphere , assuming tio / vo and feh absorption is responsible for the additional opacity measured across the 1.121.3@xmath1 wavelength range . in contrast , wasp-12b is observed to have a hazy atmosphere without tio / vo @xcite , despite having similar properties to wasp-121b , reinforcing the emerging picture of hot gas giant diversity @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the optical data can not currently exclude a model including both tio / vo absorption and haze scattering for wasp-121b .",
    "such a model would be very similar to our best - fit model ( red line in figure [ fig : transmission_spectrum ] ) , except that the effective radius would continue increasing for wavelengths shortward of the @xmath3 bandpass . to confidently discount such a scenario",
    ", it will be necessary to spectrally resolve the characteristic steep rise in opacity at @xmath209 due to tio / vo with further observations .    until then",
    ", the evidence for tio / vo absorption in the atmosphere of wasp-121b remains tentative , as it primarily hinges upon the relative radius measured from the ground in the @xmath201 bandpass .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this measurement is based on two lightcurves that produce consistent results when analyzed separately and simultaneously ( top panel of figure [ fig : transmission_spectrum ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite report ground - based secondary eclipse measurements in the @xmath210 bandpass that imply a brightness temperature higher than the equilibrium temperature predicted for zero bond albedo and instantaneous heat re - radiation .",
    "this could potentially be explained by a thermal inversion , with tio being observed in emission in the @xmath210 bandpass .",
    "again , follow - up observations that spectrally resolve the tio / vo features will be necessary for confirmation .",
    "to date , _ hst _ spectroscopy data have been published for three exoplanets with @xmath211k . of these ,",
    "tio / vo absorption has been ruled out for wasp-12b ( @xmath212k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wasp-19b ( @xmath213k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while evidence for tio emission has been reported for wasp-33b ( @xmath9k ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that wasp-33b is hot enough to maintain tio / vo in the gas phase throughout its dayside atmosphere , whereas the day - night terminators of wasp-12b and wasp-19b are too cool , or cold - trapping occurs elsewhere in their atmospheres .",
    "however , the fact that wasp-121b has a lower equilibrium temperature ( @xmath0k ) than wasp-12b , and yet shows evidence for tio / vo absorption at low pressures , indicates that additional factors are at play .",
    "for instance , models predict larger temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside hemispheres with increasing stellar irradiation and planet metallicity @xcite .",
    "it is thus plausible that wasp-12b , with its higher irradiation and host star metallicity , has a cooler nightside than wasp-121b , which could result in a nightside cold - trap for wasp-12b but not wasp-121b .",
    "compositional differences could also have a significant influence on the temperature profiles for each planet , in turn determining the susceptibility to cold - trapping .",
    "we have presented a transmission spectrum for wasp-121b spanning the @xmath6@xmath207 wavelength range .",
    "absorption by h@xmath196o is detected at high confidence ( @xmath2 ) , consistent with predictions of clear atmosphere models .",
    "deeper transits measured at optical wavelengths relative to the near - infrared strongly favor models including tio / vo absorption , but scattering by a high - altitude haze can not yet be definitively excluded .",
    "we also find evidence for feh absorption in the wfc3 bandpass .",
    "wasp-121b is one of the most favorable targets available for both transmission and emission spectroscopy , and offers particular promise for exploring the link between strong optical absorbers , such as tio / vo , and thermal inversions in hot gas giant atmospheres .                  ,",

    "<S> we present a primary transit observation for the ultra hot ( @xmath0k ) gas giant expolanet wasp-121b , made using the _ hubble space telescope _ wide field camera 3 in spectroscopic mode across the 1.121.64@xmath1 wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> the 1.4@xmath1 water absorption band is detected at high confidence ( @xmath2 ) in the planetary atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we also reanalyze ground - based photometric lightcurves taken in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 filters . </S>",
    "<S> significantly deeper transits are measured in these optical bandpasses relative to the near - infrared wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that scattering by high - altitude haze alone is unlikely to account for this difference , and instead interpret it as evidence for titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced opacity is also inferred across the @xmath6@xmath7 wavelength range , possibly due to iron hydride absorption . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed , wasp-121b will be the first exoplanet with titanium oxide , vanadium oxide , and iron hydride detected in transmission . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are important species in m / l dwarfs , and their presence is likely to have a significant effect on the overall physics and chemistry of the atmosphere , including the production of a strong thermal inversion . </S>"
