    "very massive stars are key actors in the energy balance and chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "their powerful winds , massive outflows and expanding hii regions inject large quantity of momentum and energetic ultraviolet ( uv ) photons into the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , the chemically evolved descendants of the most massive o type stars , have been suggested as possible precursors of core - collapse supernovae of types ib and ic @xcite . as consequence , they are the main generators of alpha elements ( such c , n , o , etc ) and due to their short life time ( considering the age of the galaxy ) , they quickly enrich ( through supernova explosions ) the ism with large quantity of heavy elements @xcite .",
    ".small sensus of the known galactic wolf - rayet stars . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     i searched for stellar clusters close to wr67a and wr67b , and found that they are located at about 10 arcsec and 15 arcmin , respectively , from the centre of the cluster candidate mcm2005b # 60 @xcite , that has central coordinates @xmath1=15:16:36 and @xmath2=-58:10:07 ( j2000 ) , which however is not obviously seem in the 2mass k@xmath3-band image .",
    "however , from the glimpse 3.6@xmath4 m and 8.0@xmath4 m images of the field around wr67a ( figure 3 ) , one can notice the presence of several point like sources ( mainly in the 3.6@xmath4 m image ) inside a cavity delineated by the hot dust extended emission , with wr67a being one of the most prominent . also from the glimpse @xmath5 m image of the region around the newly - discovered wn star ,",
    "it can be seem the hot dust extended emission nicely tracing what seems to be the effects of a powerful stellar wind into the surrounding nebula .",
    "indeed , wr67a appears as the unique point source placed near the centre of the cavity that is seem in the @xmath5 m image , which is probably associated to a galactic hii region detected by the h 109@xmath1/h 110@xmath1 radio recombination line survey performed by @xcite .",
    "their source # 143 ( g321.1 -0.55 ) , measuring about 3 arcmin @xmath6 3 arcmin , has coordinates 15:16:36.3 -58:12:10 ( j2000 ) .",
    "it presents a flux density of 8.5 jy at 5 ghz , and a radial velocity of -56 km / s , measured from the associated hydrogen recombination lines . from the use of the galactic rotation curve",
    ", they computed far and near heliocentric distances of 11.6 kpc and 3.9 kpc , respectively .",
    "interesting , both values are similar to those obtained in this work when wr67a is considered to be a wn6h ( 10.5@xmath02.1 kpc ) and a wn6(weak ) ( 3.4@xmath7 kpc ) type wr star , respectively .",
    "in this work i report the discovery of two new galactic wolf - rayet stars in the direction of circinus .",
    "the analysis of their eso - ntt - sofi h- and k - band spectra , indicate that wr67a and wr67b are wr stars belonging to the wn and wc types , respectively .",
    "wr67a presents a weak - lined spectrum reminiscent of young hydrogen rich _ main - sequence _ wn6h stars such as hd93162 ( wr25 ) in car ob1 and hd97950 in ngc3603 , which due to their high - luminosities drive dense and fast winds , appear mimicking the spectral appearance of wr stars . in one hand",
    ", this assumption is reinforced by the close morphological match of the wr67a h- and k - band spectra with that for wr21a , an extremely massive binary system ( o3f / wn6 ha + early o ) for which @xcite estimated m(wn6)>87m@xmath8 and m(o)>53m@xmath8 . in this case ,",
    "an heliocentric distance of 10.5@xmath02.1 kpc is computed , placing wr67a in the other side of the galaxy , probably in the far portion of the scutum - centaurus arm . on the other hand , if we consider an alternative scenario where wr67a is supposed to be a weak - lined wn star showing an emission line spectra diluted by the presence of a binary / line - of - sight companion , a much lower heliocentric distance of 3.4@xmath7 kpc",
    "is found .",
    "wr67b is a wc8 wolf - rayet star probably placed at an heliocentric distance of 2.7@xmath00.9 kpc , which for galactic coordinates g321.4 -0.4 , puts it probably at the near portion of the scutum - centaurus arm .",
    "late - type wc stars sometimes are surrounded by circumstellar hot dust , but the observed nir colours of wr67b seems to be compatible with those for a non - dusty wc8 type wr star reddened by about 7 - 10 magnitudes in the v band . indeed , its k - band carbon lines do not seem to be `` diluted '' by the presence of a line - of - sight companion .",
    "however , the absence of reduced line strengths , in principle can not be used to discard the presence of a line - of - sight / binary early - type companion since relatively short period late - type wc binaries ( e.g. like @xmath9 vel ( wc8+o ) ) , are known not to form dust .",
    "i would like to thanks the comments and suggestions made by the referee , dr . paul crowther .",
    "his comments were very useful to improve the quality and presentation of the final manuscript .",
