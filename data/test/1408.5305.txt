    "the ramsey method  @xcite of separated oscillatory fields is a highly successful method of precision spectroscopy and has been extensively used in a wide spectral range starting from radio frequency to optical domain .",
    "this method has yielded the atomic and molecular transition frequencies with very high precision especially by using phase coherent pulses with a duration short compared to the atomic decay times .",
    "the ramsey technique is an interference techniques in which one studies the result of the quantum mechanical amplitudes in different domains where fields are applied .",
    "the ramsey s interferometric technique has so far been used in the context of the study of the phase coherence in atomic and molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "ramsey method has been especially successful in the detection of quantum coherences , such as in the detection of the cat states of the electromagnetic field  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a demonstration of the ramsey interferometry ( ri ) in the context of a macroscopic system like a nanomechanical system .",
    "the ramsey interferometry is especially important in probing the dynamics of the nanomechanical system as the detected interference signals would be sensitive to any dynamical changes in the mechanical oscillator in the time between which the pulses are off .",
    "the dynamics is a direct measure of the coherence time of the mechanical mirror which is an important issue in precision measurements  @xcite .",
    "we note that a variety of coherent techniques have been used to study optomechanical and electromechanical systems .",
    "these techniques primarily make use of the electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption  @xcite and the resulting applications like storage of light  @xcite , slow light  @xcite , etc",
    ". we also note that in a recent work  @xcite , ramsey interferometry is used to probe the dynamical behavior of two nanostring resonators coupled by an rf field .",
    "these authors realized a two level system in this manner and then applied the technique of ramsey interferometry as originally developed by ramsey . in our work",
    "we perform ramsey interferometry using an optical mode and a mechanical mode .    in atomic systems ,",
    "the ri uses two spatially or temporally separated laser pulses to interact with atoms and detects the excitation probability of the atoms .",
    "each laser pulse drives the atomic transition between the ground state @xmath0 and excited state @xmath1 . the atomic transition probability after a single weak pulse excitation  @xcite has a form  @xcite of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the frequency detuning between the laser and the atomic transition frequency . for simplicity ,",
    "we use square pulses although other pulse forms can be used .",
    "ramsey s two - pulse scheme yields sharper interference patterns without requiring a long interaction time .",
    "it has the excitation probability @xmath4 . here the pulse separation in time @xmath5 is shorter than the decay time of the atoms .",
    "note that we use weak pulses in contrast to the case where rabi oscillations are used .",
    "the pattern arises from the quantum interference of two paths in which the atom can get excited .",
    "the ri is expected to be useful whenever we have a system with a long decay time .",
    "therefore , we make use of the very long decay time of the mechanical coherence  @xcite to demonstrate ramsey interferometry in an optomechanical system ( oms ) .",
    "there are similarities between this work and the storage work  @xcite . in storage work , one demonstrates the ability of the optomechanical system to store light pulses and to recover these . in ri ,",
    "the objective is quite different : here one wants to have a sensitive probe of the dynamics of the mirror and even a sensitive probe of the displacements .",
    "thus in storage , the focus is on optical pulses whereas in ri the focus is on the mechanical element .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe in detail the experimental setup and method of ri in optomechanics ; we also show the results exhibiting ramsey interference patterns . in sec .",
    "iii , we theoretically explain the phenomenon starting from the hamiltonian and obtain the condition to see ramsey pattern in optomechanics . in sec .",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "since our experiment is done with fields in the classical domain , we obtain theoretical results valid in this regime only .",
    "in this article , we consider a generic oms which contains a fabry - perot optical cavity with an oscillating mirror on one side , as in fig .",
    "the motion of this mirror is driven by the radiation pressure force of the optical mode .",
    "this model is applicable to a large number of other systems , such as electromechanical systems @xcite , brillouin modes in microfluidic devices @xcite , and mechanical breathing modes in silica microspheres @xcite , microtoroids @xcite , or microdisks disk .",
    "for the proposed optomechanical ri , we enable the optomechanical coupling in two time - separated regions , during which a pair of laser pulses including both driving pulse and probe pulse are sent into the cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the probe laser , with frequency @xmath6 , is near the cavity resonance , @xmath7 and the driving laser , with frequency @xmath8 , is near the red sideband of the cavity resonance , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the mechanical frequency ( see fig.[fig1]b ) . for convenience , we also define two frequency parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 and is close to zero if the probe field is on resonance with the cavity frequency .",
    "then @xmath14 if @xmath15 . the pulse sequence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , where we denote the widths of the pulses by @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the separation by t. the time - dependent amplitudes of the driving and probe , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are both nonzero only during the pulses : @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22\\cup \\lbrack t+\\tau _ { 1},t+\\tau_{1}+\\tau_{2}]$ ] , and @xmath23 otherwise .        in a ri setup ,",
    "two pairs of pulses with separation t are sent to the cavity .",
    "two processes are taking place when a pulse pair is in the cavity : the coupling and probe photons combine and produce coherent phonons ; and the coherent phonons combine with the coupling photons and generate an anti - stokes sideband near the cavity resonance .",
    "the application of the first pulse pair creates both coherent phonons and cavity photons .",
    "after the first pulse pair , the optical mode decays rapidly during the free evolution and it becomes negligible as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total decay rate of the cavity mode . on the other than , the mechanical mode shows almost no decay as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mechanical damping rate .",
    "this is because @xmath28 .",
    "thus , before the second pulse pair is applied , the mechanical mode barely decays but gathers a phase @xmath29 .",
    "now we examine the two paths which lead to the interference in the optical field produced at @xmath6 .",
    "the phonon created in the zone @xmath30  survives and interacts with the driving laser to produce a photon at @xmath6 via process in the zone @xmath17 .",

    "these two paths are displayed in fig .",

    "therefore , the fringes arise from the mechanical coherence effects although we observe such coherences in the optical fields . in the optomechanical ri",

    "were used to generate optical pulses with the desired duration , timing , and frequencies , as shown in fig.3 ( a ) .",
    "the driving and the locking pulses came from a single - frequency tunable diode laser ( toptica dlpro 780 ) with @xmath39 and with its frequency locked to the red sideband of a given wgm resonance using the pound - drever - hall technique .",

    ", a large @xmath97 enhances the ramsey fringes contrast , although the fringes can still be seen at a shorter @xmath97 .",

    "however , after long enough time , the ramsey fringes disappear because of the damping of phonons , as shown in fig .",
    "therefore , we should choose the @xmath124 as small as possible during the experiment for observing ramsey fringes .",
    "this is demonstrated more clearly in fig .",

    "future work may also include the demonstration of the ramsey fringes using excitations at the single photon level which would imply excitation of a mechanical oscillator at the single phonon level needless to say that achieving quantum regime experimentally would require at least the coherent fields at the single photon level as well as cooling to temperatures such that the mean phonon number is less than @xmath125 .",
