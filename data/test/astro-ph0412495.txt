    "because of their extreme energy and isotropic distribution , it is believed that uhecrs are extragalactic in origin .",
    "observations of uhecrs having energies in excess of 10@xmath2ev ( 100 eev ) present difficult puzzles with regard to their origin , their nature , and their propagation @xcite . after the discovery of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , greisen @xcite and zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite pointed out that photomeson interactions should deplete the flux of cosmic rays with energies above @xmath3 50 eev .",
    "one of us @xcite , using data on the energy dependence of the photomeson production cross section , then made a quantitative calculation of this `` gzk effect '' deriving the mean photomeson energy loss attenuation length for protons as a function of proton energy .",
    "these results indicated that the attenuation length of a proton with an energy greater than 100 eev is less than 100 mpc which is much less than the visible radius of the universe ( see figure [ eloss ] @xcite ) .",
    "thus , what is sometimes referred to as the gzk `` cutoff '' is not a true cutoff , but a suppression of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray flux arising from a limitation of proton propagation through the cosmic background radiation .",
    "more recently , ground based detectors have detected a double digit number of events with energies above 100 eev , placing the existence of the gzk effect somewhat in doubt @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is also because of a _ prima facie _ conflict between the observational results @xcite , @xcite and is probably due , at least in part , to poor statistics @xcite .",
    "the need to increase the number of observed events in order to improve the determination of the uhecr spectrum , particularly above 100 eev , has resulted both in the development of the more sensitive _",
    "_ detector array @xcite and the proposal of even more sensitive space - based detector missions such as _ euso _ @xcite and _ owl _ @xcite .",
    "with the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics came the suggestion that lorentz invariance ( li ) might be weakly broken at high energies @xcite .",
    "although no true quantum theory of gravity exists , it was suggested that li might be violated in such a theory with astrophysical consequences @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that a possible natural abrogation of the gzk effect , resulting in the existence of significant fluxes of uhecrs at trans - gzk energies , could be caused by a small amount of lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recent work has placed strong constraints on such liv , constraints which may have important implications for some quantum gravity and large extra dimension models @xcite-@xcite . however , only a very small amount of liv could substantially curtail the photomeson production and @xmath4 pair production that result from the high energy protons interacting with the cbr .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the observational implications of this possible effect of a very small amount of liv , _ viz .",
    "_ , that cosmic rays could indeed reach us after originating at distances greater than 100 mpc without undergoing large energy losses from photomeson and pair production interactions .",
    "such a small violation of lorentz invariance might be produced by planck scale effects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a simple formulation for breaking li by a small first order perturbation in the free particle lagrangian which leads to a renormalizable treatment has been given by coleman and glashow @xcite .",
    "using this formalism , these authors point out that different particles can have different maximum attainable velocities ( mavs ) which can be different from @xmath5 .",
    "if we denote the mav of a particle of type @xmath6 by @xmath7 and the difference @xmath8 then coleman and glashow have shown that for interactions of protons with cbr photons of energy @xmath9 and temperature @xmath10 k , pion production ( @xmath11 s ) is kinematically forbidden to take place and thus _ cbr photomeson production interactions are turned off _ if    @xmath12    the condition for significantly increasing the threshold for electron - positron pair production interactions ( @xmath13 ) is given by @xcite    @xmath14    which is @xmath15@xmath16 for a fiducial energy @xmath17 eev . the relation given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) is similar to that derived for @xmath18 pair production in ref .",
    "these values are much smaller than the constraint @xmath19 found in ref .",
    "@xcite and also smaller than the conditional constraint of @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath15@xmath22 derived in ref .",
    "thus , given even a very small amount of li violation , both photomeson and pair - production interactions of uhecr with the cbr can be turned off .",
    "we consider a power - law source spectrum that will be capable of explaining the uhecr data after propagation effects are considered .",
    "we first describe our model for propagating the high energy protons .",
    "we then calculate the effects of violating lorentz invariance on the photomeson and pair production energy loss mechanisms resulting from the high energy protons interacting with the cbr .",
    "we derive and show the predicted spectra to be observed at the earth that result from including liv effects in our models .",
    "we end by giving the power density requirements of the source spectrum needed to produce the observed uhecr flux .",
    "we first reconsider the standard picture for the propagation of high energy protons , including energy losses resulting from cosmological redshifting , pair production and pion production through interactions with cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) photons ( see above ) .",
    "we shall assume for this calculation a flat @xmath23cdm universe with a hubble constant of h@xmath24 = 70 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 , taking @xmath26 = 0.7 and @xmath27 = 0.3 .",

    "the photon cbr number density increases as @xmath33 and the cbr photon energies increase linearly with @xmath34 . the corresponding energy loss for protons at any redshift @xmath35",

    "let @xmath39 be the volume emissivity of particles produced by uhecr sources at redshift @xmath35 at an initial energy @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that @xmath39 has a power - law energy dependence of the form    @xmath41    we further assume a redshift evolution of the volume emissivity of the uhecr sources to be of a form similar to that of the star formation rate , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath42    we first calculate the initial energy @xmath43 at which a proton is created at a redshift @xmath35 whose observed energy today is @xmath44 following the methods detailed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we neglect the effect of possible small intergalactic magnetic fields on the paths of these ultrahigh energy protons and assume that they will propagate along straight lines from their source .",
    "we then compute the `` gzk energy '' for uhecrs versus redshift of origin using the @xmath23cdm model with the cosmological parameters given above .",
    "this is defined as the energy at which the spectrum drops to @xmath45 of its original value owing to photomeson production .",
    "we have updated our result from ref .",
    "@xcite to reflect the @xmath23cdm cosmology used in this paper and the new result is given in figure [ egzk ] .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ egzk ] that the protons of energy above 10 eev can not have originated further than a redshift of @xmath46 .",
    "the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum flattens above 3 eev @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this flattening is usually interpreted as being caused by the emergence of a harder extragalactic component which dominates the spectrum at energies above 3 eev , whereas below this energy the observed spectrum is dominated by a more steeply falling galactic component .    in our calculations",
    "we assume a power law extragalactic uhecr source spectrum with a value for @xmath47 of 2.6 which , even after modification by energy losses , dominates above @xmath48 eev . , but that this does not produce a spectrum that fits the observational data . ] for this reason , and because the uhecr data have smaller error bars at lower energies , we have chosen to normalize our propagation - modified extragalactic component at 3 eev .",
    "also , if liv turns off the gzk effect , the maximum observable proton energy is no longer limited by it .",
    "because the only significant energy loss for protons with energy above 500 eev then comes from redshifting ( see figure [ eloss ] ) , a power - law source spectrum will produce a power - law uhecr spectrum with the same spectral index .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of our calculations , we assumed an arbitrary maximum uhecr energy of 500 eev in the source spectrum .",
    "however , in the case of liv with a positive value of @xmath49 @xmath15(10@xmath50 ) , the maximum proton energy can be limited by the vacuum erenkov effect @xcite,@xcite .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have considered two scenarios for the uhecr emissivity corresponding to different values for the redshift evolution index , @xmath51 , _ viz .",
    "_ , ( 1 ) a constant comoving source density distribution ( @xmath52 ) , _ i.e. _ no source evolution , out to a maximum redshift , @xmath53 , and ( 2 ) an emissivity evolution with a redshift dependence proportional to the star formation rate , taken to be a source luminosity evolution corresponding to @xmath54 for @xmath55 with no further evolution out to @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we next incorporate the potential effects of liv on the proton energy loss rate into our model . in the first case ( a ) considered , this is implemented by nullifying the energy loss from photomeson production as a possible consequence of liv .",
    "in addition to this case , we present the results obtained for two other possible scenarios _ viz .",
    "_ , ( b ) the case where the pair production energy loss mechanism is nullified but not that from photomeson production and , ( c ) the case where the energy losses from both photomeson production and pair production are nullified . in all of these cases , we have imposed an arbitrary cutoff energy of 500 eev on the postulated source spectrum .",
    "the results of our calculations , along with the spectra obtained for the standard li case , are given in figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] for the source evolution model and figures [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] for the no evolution ( @xmath52 ) model .",
    "all of these figures also show the _ hires _",
    "@xcite , _ fly s eye _ @xcite and _ agasa _ @xcite data .",
    "these spectra are normalized at an energy of 3 eev above which energy the extragalactic cosmic ray component is assumed to be dominant and below which we assume that the galactic cosmic ray component dominates ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "the results shown are calculated for `` on '' and `` off '' energy losses for both photomeson production and pair production for protons . as can be seen in figures [ f3 ] and [ f5 ] ,",
    "the li case fits the _ hires _ spectrum , while the liv case fits the _ agasa _ spectrum .",
    "it can also be seen from figs .",
    "[ f3 ] - [ f6 ] that , in principle , a very small amount of li violation can eliminate the gzk `` cutoff '' .",
    "also , when pair - production is turned off , the @xmath3 10 eev `` bite '' in the predicted spectrum is eliminated .",
    "of course , when both interactions are turned off , all of the features in the predicted spectrum disappear and only a power - law remains .",
    "contrary to the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , as can be seen from the figures , the present data can not be used to put constraints on li violation in pair - production interactions .",
    "the uhecr source power density requirements for the source evolution and no evolution cases are different . the absolute minimum power density required",
    "is found by integrating the source spectrum times particle energy from 3 eev to 500 eev . since we have normalized this spectrum at 3 eev where photomeson production is unimportant , we only have four cases to consider :    \\(1 ) with source evolution and no pair production losses , we find that the minimum local ( @xmath57 ) power density required is @xmath58 w mpc@xmath59 .",

    "\\(4 ) with no evolution and including pair production losses , we find that the local minimum power density required is @xmath62 w mpc@xmath59 .",
    "in all cases , we note that the local minimum power density required is orders of magnitude larger than that estimated if the sources are @xmath1-ray bursts and if we equate their power output in uhecrs with their power output in @xmath1-rays .",

    "of course , the extragalactic component should naturally extend below 3 eev .",
    "if it does so with @xmath65 , this can further increase the source energy requirements .",
    "we consider the source evolution case to be a more probable scenario as the frequency of astrophysical production sites , regardless of specific mechanism , is likely to be closely tied to the star formation rate for various reasons .    if the gzk effect is confirmed , eq .",

    "if , on the other hand , liv is the explanation for a missing gzk effect , one can also look for the absence of a potential `` pileup '' spectral feature at @xmath67 eev @xcite and for the absence of ultrahigh energy photomeson neutrinos .",
