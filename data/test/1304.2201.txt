    "the general goal of quantum information processing is to manipulate the information coded in a particular quantum system , while simultaneously trying to isolate it from undesired perturbations due to the external environment .",
    "for instance , in the fields of quantum computation  @xcite and quantum simulation  @xcite , the processing stage usually relies on a designed unitary evolution which , preserving the coherence of the system , provides a quantum state that contains the outcome of the computation , or the properties of the quantum phase of matter under study .",
    "therefore , the experimental progress in these fields has been typically associated to technological developments that minimize experimental imperfections and maximize environmental isolation  @xcite .",
    "however , the coupling of a system to its surrounding environment is not necessarily a disadvantage .",
    "in fact , the dissipation of a quantum system , if judiciously exploited , can act as a resource for quantum information processing .",
    "this interesting change of paradigm started with the recognition that dissipation can assist the generation of entanglement between distant atoms , either in free space  @xcite , or trapped inside cavities  @xcite . by measuring the presence of a photon spontaneously emitted by the atoms  @xcite , or its absence  @xcite , it is possible to project an initially uncorrelated atomic state into a maximally entangled one , as has been recently experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "these schemes can be improved further by tailoring the atom - cavity interaction  @xcite or by modifying the measurement techniques  @xcite , and can also be generalized to provide a route towards universal quantum computation  @xcite . since the dissipation does not always render the desired result in these approaches , the measurement is required to select only the successful outcomes .",
    "therefore , the combination of dissipation and measurement can be considered as a probabilistic resource for quantum information .",
    "another promising approach is to assess whether , by designing the system - environment coupling in a particular way , the dissipation could provide the desired quantum state with certainty .",
    "this _ quantum reservoir engineering _ finds its roots in the theory of laser cooling of atoms  @xcite and , more related to this work , of trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "laser - cooling schemes try to design the system - environment coupling such that the dissipation yields a stationary state with reduced kinetic energy .",
    "these ideas can be taken a step further in order to non - probabilistically produce stationary states that display non - classical aspects , or a certain amount of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "for instance , by mimicking superradiance phenomena  @xcite , certain engineered decay channels yield partial entanglement in the stationary mixed state  @xcite . however , it would be highly desirable to devise dissipative protocols that provide _ maximally - entangled pure states _ asymptotically , the so - called dark states , showing fidelities comparable to those obtained by more standard unitary schemes  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently pursued by different groups which have shown that , provided that one can engineer a dissipation that acts quasi - locally on different parts of the system , it is possible to design dissipative protocols to produce a number of paradigmatic dark states  @xcite , or to perform universal dissipative quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "for instance , by engineering a particular dissipation that acts on pairs of adjacent atoms in an optical lattice , the system can be driven dissipatively into a superfluid phase  @xcite .",
    "in addition , as initially proposed for rydberg atoms  @xcite and first realized in experiments of trapped ions  @xcite , by concatenating multi - qubit gates with a controlled dissipation of ancillary qubits , a variety of multipartite entangled states ( i.e. bell , greenberger - horne - zeilinger , and dicke states ) have been dissipatively generated with reasonably high fidelities .",
    "let us note that this stroboscopic time - evolution corresponds to a markovian master equation in the limit of many gates and dissipation steps , where the dissipative jump operators correspond to multi - qubit jump operators . from a fundamental point of view , it is of interest to address whether similar dissipative protocols can also work in an _",
    "( i ) analog _ and _ ( ii ) global _ fashion ( i.e. using always - on couplings without individual addressing ) . additionally , from a more pragmatic point of view , such global analog schemes would not be limited by the accumulation of the errors in each step of the stroboscopic protocols . however , finding particular schemes to provide multi - qubit jump operators in an analog manner seems to be a tremendous task from both a theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "therefore , we impose a further constraint , the jump operators should be composed of _ ( iii ) single - qubit operators_.    in this article , we develop an instance of a global analog dissipative protocol that generates multipartite entangled states corresponding to ground states of a quantum spin chain .",
    "the underlying idea is to engineer jump operators that are a particular sum of single - spin operators , in analogy to the models of collective spontaneous emission  @xcite .",
    "we show that , if the dissipation of the spins is mediated by a common harmonic mode , the spin chain sees a structured markovian environment .",
    "by structured environment we refer to a spectral density exhibiting a sharp peak at a certain frequency ( so called breit - wigner resonance ) , corresponding to a weakly damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "this structure will allow us to design jump operators in such a way that the stationary state of the system corresponds to the ground state of the quantum spin chain .",
    "in particular , we consider an isotropic xy spin chain , which describes a critical phase of matter .",
    "we explain in detail how to implement this protocol with trapped ions , relying on tools that have already been achieved experimentally .",
    "these tools are the so - called state - dependent forces  @xcite , and sympathetic resolved - sideband cooling developed for quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "we test the scheme for realistic parameters , and show that the fidelities that can be achieved are comparable to the unitary protocols that produce multipartite entangled states  @xcite .",
    "our procedure performs well for small chains of trapped ions , which is actually the regime in most of the current experiments .",

    "let us start by introducing the model under consideration : an interacting spin-@xmath3 chain coupled to a damped bosonic mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme]*(a ) * ) .",
    "this model , which shall be referred to as the _ damped spin - boson chain _ ( dsbc ) in the rest of the manuscript , is a many - body generalization of a system considered recently for the dissipative generation of two - qubit entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the dsbc is described by the following master equation ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5+\\mathcal{d}_{\\rm b}(\\rho),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the total density matrix , and @xmath7 is the dissipative liouvillian .",
    "we consider a finite chain of @xmath8 spins evolving under the isotropic xy hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an antiferromagnetic interaction strength , and we introduced the raising and lowering operators @xmath11 .",
    "the bosonic hamiltonian consists of a single mode @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the creation and annihilation operators ( the oscillator frequency @xmath15 can actually correspond to a detuning @xmath16 , as will become clear from the experimental implementation ) .",
    "the spins and the boson are coupled through @xmath17 in the above expression , we have introduced the site - dependent coupling strength @xmath18 , and the pauli matrices @xmath19 . finally , we also consider weak damping of the bosonic mode via a lindblad - type dissipator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the damping rate .",
    "we note that all these individual ingredients can be realized with the state - of - the - art technology of trapped - ion crystals , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ions ] .",
    "the objective of this work is to understand the interplay of these dynamics , such that the liouvillian @xmath7 generates stationary entanglement between the initially uncorrelated spins .",
    "so far , we can already appreciate two of the properties of the protocol outlined in the introduction : _",
    "( i ) _ it is _ analog _ , since the couplings  - are considered to be switched on during the whole protocol .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ it is _ global _ , since the couplings  - address all the spins of the chain .",
    "let us note that the spin - chain hamiltonian   alone could already generate entangled states unitarily at given instants of time . nonetheless , these correlations have a transient nature , whereas the interest of this work is the onset of stationary correlations .",
    "therefore , we explore the interplay of this hamiltonian part with the irreversible dynamics introduced by the damped boson through the spin - boson coupling  .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme]*(a ) * , we represent schematically the dsbc .",
    "the spin chain is considered to be our system @xmath22 , whereas the bosonic mode , together with the markovian reservoir where it dissipates , provide an effective structured environment @xmath23 for the spin chain . at first sight",
    ", the dephasing - like spin - boson coupling   seems to introduce a source of decoherence in the spin chain , thus hindering rather than assisting the generation of stationary entanglement . in the following section",
    ", we will show that this nave intuition is not always valid , and explain the subtle mechanism that allows for generation of stationary entanglement in a particular regime of the system parameters .",
    "we consider an initial state of the system @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an arbitrary state of the harmonic mode , and the uncorrelated spin state @xmath26 has a single spin excitation at the left edge of the chain . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the system liouvillian @xmath7 acts on this state , allowing for the onset of stationary entanglement .      as a consequence of the xy hamiltonian",
    ", the initially localized spin excitation is exchanged between different neighbors .",
    "in fact , the spin chain corresponds exactly to a tight - binding model where the excitation hops along the sites of the underlying chain according to @xmath27 in this expression , @xmath28 results from the projection of the xy hamiltonian onto the single - excitation subspace @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the projector onto an @xmath8-dimensional subspace spanned by the states @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 labels the position of the spin excitation in the chain .",
    "this tight - binding model gives rise to the following band structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme]*(b ) * ) @xmath33 where each energy is associated to a `` spin - wave excitation '' @xmath34 the goal of this section is to find the conditions to generate dissipatively one of these multipartite entangled states , @xmath35 .",
    "we consider a spatial modulation of the spin - boson coupling strength   in the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . in the single - excitation subspace ,",
    "the spin - boson coupling becomes @xmath38 where the ladder operators @xmath39 are responsible for ascending or descending along the ladder of spin - wave excitations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme]*(b ) * ) .",
    "accordingly , the spin - boson coupling   connects different spin - wave excitations , while simultaneously creating or annihilating bosonic quanta .",
    "moreover , since the harmonic mode dissipates irreversibly into a markovian environment  , the ladder operators @xmath40 introduce irreversible dynamics in the spin chain . in terms of these ladder operators ,",
    "the single - excitation spin - chain hamiltonian   reads @xmath41 where for simplicity we reset the zero of energy at the bottom of the band .",
    "we show below how to generate mesoscopic entangled states by controlling the relative strengths of the dissipative processes that take the system up and down the _ spin - wave ladder_.      since we are interested in the stationary properties of the dsbc , we consider long times @xmath42 , such that the bosonic mode has enough time to relax under the action of the damping .",
    "besides , for @xmath43 , this relaxation is much faster than the process of energy exchange between the boson and the spins . in this limit ,",
    "the boson thermalizes individually , and the spin chain evolves on a much slower timescale under such a bosonic background .    to obtain the effect of the boson background on the slower spin dynamics  @xcite , we must `` integrate out ''",
    "the bosonic degrees of freedom from the spin - boson coupling  .",
    "we start with a state of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the vacuum of the harmonic mode , and fulfills @xmath46 .",
    "we then expand the state at a later time @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , in powers of the coupling constant @xmath49 between the spin system and the oscillator , keeping up to second order in @xmath49 .",
    "tracing over the mode , we obtain : @xmath50 where the `` hat '' indicates that we work in interaction picture with respect to @xmath51 , and where we have introduced @xmath52 $ ] . using the explicit form of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ,",

    "[ fig_scheme]*(b ) * ) .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ first_integral ] ) contains some terms that oscillate rapidly in time .",
    "we now perform the remaining integral , assuming that the time interval @xmath60 is short compared to the time scale given by @xmath61 , but long enough such that @xmath62 .",
    "this condition restricts the values of @xmath49 for which this treatment is valid . to perform the integral , we group the frequencies @xmath63 in such a way that within each group the frequencies are equal , and the difference between the frequencies in different groups is finite ( we note that this is not possible in the limit of infinite sizes , where the energies become a continuum ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the presence of degenerate frequencies is typical in this model and makes the grouping necessary .",
    "if one keeps only the dominant terms , which are the terms in the integrand that are constant in time , back in schrdinger picture one finds the following master equation governing the coarse - grained evolution over the time scales of interest : @xmath64+\\mathcal{d}_{\\rm s } ( \\rho_{\\rm s}),\\ ] ] with @xmath65\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and where @xmath66\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in the expressions above , the sum over @xmath67 runs over the different transition frequencies in the system , @xmath68 denotes an anticommutator , and the lindblad operators are defined as : [ jump_operator ] j_^+ = _",
    "n/_n= l_n^+ = j_^-^where the sum is over all the values of @xmath69 such that @xmath70 .",
    "the action of the different lindblad operators is weighted by the spectral density of the effective environment , @xmath71}.\\ ] ] according to these expressions , the spins are subjected to a lorentzian reservoir centered at the boson detuning @xmath15 with a width given by the boson damping rate @xmath72 . therefore , the dissipation on the spins is not equal at all frequencies , but stronger at frequencies matching that of the bosonic mode ( i.e. they do not see a totally flat environment , but a structured one  @xcite ) .    as announced previously , the ladder operators @xmath40 are responsible for introducing the irreversible dynamics in the spin chain . in particular , they determine the collective jump operators  , where the adjective collective emphasizes that they act over all the spins in the chain .",
    "however , we remark that these jump operators are a sum of single - spin operators , as opposed to the multi - spin nature of some other engineered dissipation protocols considered recently  @xcite . with this discussion",
    ", we show the third property of the protocol outlined in the introduction : jump operators are composed of sums of _ ( iii ) single - qubit operators_. this draws an analogy to the models of collective spontaneous emission  @xcite , but we will show that the special dissipation mediated by the boson mode allows us to use them to prepare dissipatively the ground state of the spin chain .    , the jump operators that descend the ladder govern the dissipative dynamics ( i.e. @xmath73 ) .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the effective lorentzian spectral density @xmath74 of the environment seen by the spin chain , which overlaps minimally with the processes that climb up the ladder . *",
    "( b , d ) * in the regime of negative oscillator detuning @xmath75 , the jump operators that climb up the ladder dominate the dissipative dynamics ( i.e. @xmath76 ) , since in this case the spectral density of the environment seen by the spin chain overlaps minimally with the processes that descend the ladder . ]",
    "we are searching for the steady state @xmath77 of eq .  , @xmath78 , with three properties : being pure , displaying multipartite entanglement , and being unique .",
    "a pure steady state @xmath79 necessarily belongs to a hamiltonian eigenspace  @xcite , which in our case is given by the spin - wave excitations @xmath80 .",
    "additionally , the steady state should also belong to the kernel of the dissipator , @xmath81 . by inspection of the jump operators , we identify two regimes where this can happen , which depend on the boson detuning with respect to the spin - wave energy difference : @xmath82 @xmath83 for the regime of positive detunings , we can then approximate the evolution using that @xmath84 is negligibly small for all @xmath69 , while all the @xmath85 are non - negligible . in that case",
    "the non - unitary part of the evolution is _ s _ s 2_j_a ( ) ( j_^- _ s j_^+ - \\ { j_^+ j_^- , _ s } ) , taking the system to the lowest state in the manifold of spin waves ( the hamiltonian part does not induce transitions between spin waves ) .",
    "thus , the unique pure steady state corresponds to the lowest spin wave @xmath86 .",
    "conversely , for negative detunings , the steady state corresponds to the highest spin - wave @xmath87 .",
    "following  @xcite , it can be shown that in these limits the particular form of the lindblad operators does not allow for mixed steady states .",
    "we thus get the desired result : a unique pure state displaying stationary multipartite entanglement .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , we represent schematically the two regimes of interest . when conditions   are fulfilled , for @xmath88 , the dissipative processes that go down the spin - wave ladder dominate since @xmath89 .",
    "effectively , the dissipation induced by the damped bosonic mode `` cools '' the spin state to the lowest - energy spin wave , @xmath90 ( see fig .  [ fig_2]*(a ) * ) .",
    "the bath spectral density peaks at the frequencies corresponding to the dissipative processes descending the spin - wave ladder ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2]*(c ) * ) and therefore , the bath absorbs very efficiently the energy dissipated by the spin chain during its relaxation to the spin wave @xmath91 .",
    "conversely , when the system parameters fulfill conditions  , for negative detunings @xmath92 , it is the dissipative processes that climb up the ladder which dominate , @xmath93 . in this limit",
    ", the bosonic mode drives the spin state to the highest - energy spin wave , @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2]*(b ) * ) .",
    "the bath spectral density is maximal for the ascending dissipative processes ( see fig .  [ fig_2]*(d ) * ) , and the bath provides the required energy to climb up the spin - wave ladder .",
    "we may thus conclude that in both regimes , the structured reservoir singles out a unique spin wave as the steady state of the chain , assisting the generation of stationary multipartite entanglement .    in the light of these results , we can also understand the regime @xmath95 .",
    "in this limit , the reservoir spectral density   becomes essentially flat , and both up / down processes contribute equally @xmath96 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that if @xmath97 is constant , the dissipator in eq .",
    "( [ complete_dissipator ] ) satisfies @xmath98 , and the totally mixed state @xmath99 becomes a steady state .",
    "this regime corresponds to the nave argument of section  [ model ] , following which one expects that the dephasing - like term   can only decohere the spin chain .",
    "it is now clear that there are other regimes ,  - , where we can profit from a structured environment to assist the generation of stationary entanglement .",
    "we now comment on the time required to reach the aforementioned steady states .",
    "in the regime where the effective liouvillian   was derived , it is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "for a particular experimental setup , where the spin couplings can not reach arbitrarily large values , this preparation time may turn out to be too long for practical purposes .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the same dissipative preparation of entangled states can be obtained in a non - markovian regime where @xmath102 , or @xmath103 .",
    "since simple master equations can not be derived analytically for this regime , we shall explore it numerically .",
    "let us note that although the spin - wave excitations   are genuinely multipartite entangled , the weights for the excitation of each of the spins in the system are different .",
    "a small modification of the scheme also allows for the dissipative generation of @xmath8-partite w - like states , where the w - state is defined as |w=(|+| + | ) .",
    "let us leave for a moment the constraint to consider purely @xmath104 couplings , and assume that it is possible to add external transverse fields that act locally at the two edges of the chain @xmath105 in the subspace with one spin excitation , the ground state of this hamiltonian is of the form |_n = _ i=1^n ( -1)^i |i , which is locally equivalent to the above @xmath8-partite w - state ( we note that the actual w - state can be obtained if the spin - spin coupling is ferromagnetic instead of antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "as opposed to the ground state of the spin system considered so far , the w - state has the property that it is fully symmetric under particle interchanges . in the state @xmath106 , the excitation is equally distributed over all the sites , and each of the particles is equally entangled with the rest",

    "therefore , the hyperfine spins will be subject to fluctuations induced by non - shielded external magnetic fields , typically leading to dephasing in a timescale of @xmath3381 - 10@xmath206ms .",
    "these timescales are comparable to the protocol times @xmath3391 - 10@xmath206ms , where we have taken @xmath3401 - 10@xmath206khz .",
    "nevertheless , these magnetic - field fluctuations act globally for standard radio - frequency traps @xmath341 , where @xmath342 is a fluctuation of the resonance frequency due to the zeeman shift ( note that this might not be the case for micro - fabricated surface traps , where fluctuating magnetic - field gradients can also arise ) .",
    "since the dynamics of the dsbc   conserves the number of spin excitations , this magnetic - field noise only introduces a global fluctuating phase , and thus does not decohere the state of the system .",
    "therefore , as far as the induced spin dynamics occurs within any subspace with a conserved number of excitations , the dissipative protocol is robust to global magnetic - field noise .",
    "* anisotropy in the trapped - ion dissipative protocol : * * ( a ) * fidelity with the desired target state for a fixed time @xmath343 and as a function of the anisotropy ratio @xmath344 for a chain of six ions in which the central four ions represent sites of the slightly - anisotropic xy spin chain .",
    "the blue dots correspond to the case of @xmath321 initial spin excitations , and the orange squares to the case of @xmath322 excitations .",
    "the oscillator was truncated to five levels . ]",
    "it is , however , important to stabilize the intensity of the state - dependent forces to the sweet spot where @xmath249 , and make sure that @xmath345 to neglect any term that does not conserve the number of excitations",
    ". the effect of off - resonant terms in the scheme leading to the xy interactions , that could give rise to non - conservation of the number of spin excitations , should be much smaller than in stroboscopic proposals @xcite since our protocol does not require fast gates @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ion chain ] , we show the achieved fidelities for anisotropies in @xmath346 .",
    "the results have been obtained numerically for the same regime as in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ion chain]*(b ) * , and indicate that if @xmath347 differ by 1 part in @xmath348 , the fidelities are not severely reduced .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ion chain ] also show a marked difference in the robustness depending on the number of spin excitations in the initial state .",
    "this behaviour , at first surprising , can be understood by looking at the small undesired hamiltonian terms responsible for the anisotropy in an interaction picture with respect to the ideal isotropic hamiltonian .",
    "the anisotropy term creates or destroys fermionic quasiparticles in pairs , and rotates with a frequency that is the sum of the energies of the two quasiparticles . for the case with only one spin up , it is possible to create from the ideal target state pairs of fermions with energy adding up to zero , so that these error terms do not rotate . in the case with two spin excitations , on the contrary ,",
    "the lower half of the fermionic spectrum is filled , so that any hamiltonian term creating or destroying a pair of fermions from the ideal target state oscillates in time , and therefore its effect is strongly suppressed .",
    "we have presented a method to dissipatively generate multipartite - entangled states corresponding to the ground states of small spin chains with isotropic xy hamiltonian in a transverse field .",
    "the protocol for dissipative state preparation is interesting from a fundamental point of view , as it illustrates how local and even purely markovian noise can assist entanglement production .",
    "indeed , the jump operators required are sums of terms acting on individual sites , in contrast with the few - body ( quasi - local ) nature of the operators in @xcite . when the noise deviates from exact markovianity , the required time for achieving the steady state",
    "is reduced , which illustrates the value of non - markovian effects for practical purposes .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the general idea underlying the procedure presented in this work is not specific to the model considered , and might be generalized to other spin hamiltonians .",
    "as an example , we introduced a variation that can be used to generate states locally equivalent to w - states .",
    "it would also be interesting to modify our dissipative protocol to prepare the ground state of a gapped spin model .",
    "for longer ion chains , the combination of more state - dependent forces   with different wavevectors could improve the scalability of the protocol .",
    "we have also explained in detail how to implement this method in small chains of trapped ions . in our proposal , two internal levels of the ions",
    "embody the spin system and a collective motional mode represents the damped oscillator .",
    "the preparation procedure requires the implementation of spin - spin interactions using the so - called mlmer - srensen scheme , the action of a state - dependent force , and sympathetic cooling , all ingredients within the capabilities of present ion - trap technology .",
    "numerical simulations including different sources of errors indicate that the protocol can produce the target states with fidelities comparable to the more standard coherent protocols  @xcite .",
    "the method presented is indeed robust against a number of experimental imperfections , and the implementation is simplified since only global addressing of the ions is required .    our results ,",
    "however , may find a realization in different experimental setups .",
    "for instance , the application of our ideas to arrays of superconducting qubits in stripline resonators seems feasible .",
    "morever , since this model can also be understood as a quadratic fermonic model with an additional chemical potential fixing the number of particles , the results may also be interesting for fermionic atoms in optical lattices .",
    "the realization of this kind of dissipative system paves the way for the implementation of more complex scenarios to study the interplay of coherent and incoherent dynamics giving rise to noise - induced criticality @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent work in the area of non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions @xcite has shown a number of fascinating results that could be demonstrated in systems of trapped ions using tools similar to the ones in our protocol .",
