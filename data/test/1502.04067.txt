    "neurons are known to exhibit a plethora of dynamical behaviors , represented by the generation of action potential patterns .",
    "one of such patterns is bursting , defined by the repeated firing of action potentials followed by quiescent periods .",
    "hence the dynamics of bursting neurons has two timescales : a fast scale related to spiking and a slow scale of bursting itself .",
    "these timescales are related to different biophysical mechanisms occuring at the level of neuron membrane : there are fast ionic currents ( chiefly @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) responsible for spiking activity and slower @xmath2 currents that modulate this activity .",
    "most neurons exhibit bursting behavior if conveniently stimulated .",
    "for example , in the neocortical layer @xmath3 pyramidal neurons , when stimulated with dc current pulses , fire an initial burst of spikes followed by shorter bursts @xcite . in layers @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 chattering neurons fire high - frequency bursts of @xmath7 spikes with a short interburst period @xcite .",
    "cortical interneurons have been found to exhibit bursting as a response to dc pulses @xcite .",
    "pyramidal neurons in the @xmath8 region of hippocampus produce high - frequency bursts after current injection @xcite .",
    "thalamocortical neurons and reticular thalamic nucleus inhibitory neurons exhibit bursting as well @xcite .",
    "purkinje cells in cerebellum can burst when their synaptic input is blocked @xcite .",
    "bursting is also an important feature of sensory systems , because bursts can increase the reliability of synaptic transmission @xcite . in some systems ,",
    "bursts improve the signal - to - noise ratio of sensory responses and might be involved in the detection of specific stimulus features @xcite .",
    "due to both synaptic coupling and common inputs among neurons there are many types of synchronization , which can be generally regarded as the presence of a consistent temporal relationship between their activity patterns @xcite . a strong form of the latter relationship is complete synchronization , where neurons spikes at the same time , i.e. a precise temporal coincidence of events .",
    "a weaker relationship is bursting synchronization , in which only the beginning of bursting is required to occur at the same time , even though the repeated spiking may not occur synchronously .",
    "there has been observed bursting synchronization in cell cultures of cortical neurons , where uncorrelated firing appeared withing the first three days and transformed progressively into synchronized bursting within a week @xcite .",
    "large - scale bursting synchonization in the @xmath9 range has been found in the thalamus during slow - wave sleep , partially originated in the thalamus and gated by modulatory input from the brainstem @xcite .",
    "various areas of the basal ganglia have been found to exhibit bursting synchronization related to parkinson s disease and resting tremor @xcite .",
    "there exists sound neurophysiological evidence that hypokinetic motor symptoms of parkinson s disease such as slowness and rigidity of voluntary movements are closely related to synchronized bursting in the @xmath10 range @xcite .",
    "the connection between bursting synchronization and pathological conditions like parkinson s disease , essential tremor and epilepsy has led to the proposal of many control strategies aiming to suppress or mitigate bursting synchronization @xcite .",
    "one of such strategies is deep - brain stimulation ( dbs ) , which consists of the application of an external high - frequency ( @xmath11 ) electrical signal by depth electrodes implanted in target areas of the brain like the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus or the subthalamic nucleus @xcite .",
    "the effect of dbs would be similar to that produced by tissue lesioning and has proved to be effective in suppression of the activity of the pacemaker - like cluster of synchronously firing neurons , and achieving a suppression of the peripheral tremor @xcite .",
    "there is strong clinical evidence that dbs is a highly effective technique for treatment of patients with parkinson s disease @xcite .    in spite of these results ,",
    "dbs is yet far from being completely understood .",
    "many results in this field have been obtained from empirical observations made during stereotaxic neurosurgery , but further progress can be obtained with proper mathematical modelling of dbs @xcite .",
    "the effects of dbs in networks of bursting neurons have been investigated when dbs is implemented through an harmonic external current @xcite and a delayed feedback signal @xcite .    on modelling the response of a neuronal network to an external perturbation like dbs it is of paramount importance to keep the model simple enough such that large - scale simulations ( using a large number of neurons ) can be performed in a reasonable computer time .",
    "in such reductionist point of view a minimal model could be one in which we can assign a geometrical phase to the bursting activity .",
    "the bursting neuron is thus regarded as a phase oscillator undergoing spontaneous oscillations with a given frequency .",
    "thus bursting synchronization becomes a special case of phase synchronization , a phenomenon well understood for coupled oscillators with and without external excitation @xcite .",
    "a simple model for the dynamics of nonlinearly coupled phase oscillators is the kuramoto model , which in its original version considers a global ( all - to - all ) coupling @xcite .",
    "it can be generalized by considering an arbitrary coupling architecture ( generalized kuramoto model ) @xcite .",
    "the particular interest in such models is that many analytical and numerical results are known for them , specially the global case for which a mean - field theory exists for the transition between a non - synchronized to a ( phase-)synchronized behavior @xcite . for generalized kuramoto models it is possible to derive analytical expressions for the critical value of the coupling strength for which the abovementioned transition occurs @xcite .",
    "hence such a body of knowledge can be applied to networks of bursting neurons , helping to design strategies of synchronization control and/or suppression like dbs .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show , using analytical and numerical arguments , that a system of coupled bursting neurons described by rulkov s model can be reduced to a generalized kuramoto model .",
    "this reduction is valid as long as phase synchronization is concerned , since for frequency synchronization the behaviors can be quite different , though .",
    "we consider , in particular , some widely used connection topologies , like random ( erds - renyi ) , small - world , and scale - free networks .",
    "we show that the analytical results for the critical coupling strength to synchronized behavior , originally derived for the generalized kuramoto model , can be used to describe the synchronization transition also for networks of bursting neurons .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "since bursting activity presents two timescales it can be also approached from the point of view of a relaxation oscillator @xcite . in our work , however , we describe bursting using a single phase . this simplification is justified since phase synchronization of bursting is chiefly related to the slow timescale . in other words , the fast spikes can be nonsynchronized even though the slow dynamics is synchronized .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the model we used to describe bursting neurons .",
    "section iii considers networks of coupled bursting neurons using different connection topologies .",
    "section iv reviews some results on the generalized kuramoto model , and section v includes the comparisons we made between kuramoto model and the network of bursting neurons .",
    "our conclusions are left to the final section .",
    "the choose of a suitable model describing the dynamics of biological neurons is dictated by some requirements .",
    "first the model must take into account the kind of dynamics one wishes to describe @xcite .",
    "for example , if all one needs is to describe a spiking neuron , for the sake of neural coding simulations for example , a simple leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) model would be enough @xcite .",
    "however if one needs to describe the interplay between different ionic currents flowing through the neuron membrane , the hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model would be a natural choice @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the hh model would require far more computational power than the lif since the former involves four complicated first - order differential equations whereas the latter just one simple equation .    with bursting neurons this criterion also holds .",
    "given that bursting results from the interplay between fast and slow ionic currents , hodking - huxley - type models would need at least one more equation to describe slow @xmath12 modulation @xcite .",
    "a model of thermally sensitive neurons exhibiting bursting has been proposed by huber and braun @xcite , which describes spike train patterns experimentally observed in facial cold receptors and hypothalamic neurons of the rat @xcite , electro - receptors organs of freshwater catfish @xcite , and caudal photo - receptor of the crayfish @xcite .",
    "however , the huber - braun model has @xmath3 differential equations for each neuron , and computational limitations impose restrictions to its use for large networks @xcite .    if numerical simulations do not need to take into account the effect of system parameters and only the phenomenological aspects of bursting are relevant , then a good choice is the two - dimensional mapping equations proposed by rulkov @xcite @xmath13}^2 } + y(n ) , \\\\",

    "[ rulkovfig](b ) ] . on comparing the dynamics of the rulkov map with similar results of the huber - braun model one is led to an approximate correspondence between variables of the rulkov map and variables with biophysical significance : the discrete time @xmath29 in the map corresponds to @xmath30 of the continuous time ; and @xmath14 stands for the membrane potential , in such a way that each unit of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ rulkovfig](a ) corresponds to _ circa _ @xmath31 .",
    "the rulkov model has been used in several numerical investigation of coupled neuron models @xcite    due to the chaoticity of the @xmath14-dynamics of the rulkov map , the duration of each burst suffers a slight variability .",
    "the beginning of each burst can be chosen rather arbitrarily , but it turns out that a useful choice is to consider the local maxima of the variable @xmath15 : let @xmath32 be the time at which the @xmath33th burst begins [ see fig .",

    "chemical synapses are thus represented here by off - band - diagonal elements , since they include the effect of distant neurons .",
    "this is a simplified model , though , since it does not take into account the number of open channels in the post - synaptic neuron . for studies of synaptic - dependent phenomena , like plasticity , memory storage , learning , pattern recognition , etc .",
    "this simplified form of the coupling term may not be sufficient for numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , we consider all interactions as bidirectional , in such a way that the adjacency matrix is symmetric ( @xmath45 ) , what is more likely to be the case in electrical than chemical synapses .",
    "however these simplifications are acceptable in a model as long as we are interested only in the effect of the network topology on the neuron dynamics .",
    "an example is the investigation of the dbs effects related to tremor associated with bursting synchronization in the thalamus @xcite .",
    "the only parameter in our model that is to characterize the intensity of the synaptic connections is the coupling strength @xmath46 .",
    "it takes on positive values for excitatory synapses and negative values for inhibitory ones . since @xmath46 is the same for all neurons in our model we can not consider here the case in which part of the synapses are excitatory ( @xmath47 ) and part inhibitory . a modification such as this ,",
    "although simple to implement in principle , would make the model more difficult to compare with minimal models of phase dynamics .",
    "the only restriction on the values of @xmath46 is that the coupling term itself can not be too large so as to drive the neuron dynamics off a bursting state .",
    "this parameter must be adjusted by trial - and - error .    since in neuronal assemblies",
    "the neurons are likely to exhibit some diversity , we choose randomly the values of @xmath21 within the interval @xmath22 $ ] according to a specified probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath48 @xcite . in spite of this we keep the other parameters with the same values ( namely @xmath49 ) since this do not change our results in an appreciable way .",

    "let us assume that a convenient form of @xmath43 has been given to the system of coupled rulkov neurons ( [ x])-([y ] ) .",
    "one distinctive effect of synaptic coupling is bursting synchronization : two or more neurons begin their bursting activity at the same times ( up to a given tolerance ) , regardless of whether or not the ensuing sequence of spikes coincides .",

    "if the neuron bursting is so uncorrelated that the times at which they burst are practically random the summation gives nearly zero and @xmath62 for such an extreme case .",

    "neurons are connected by axons and dendrites , so that we can regard those neurons as embedded in a three - dimensional lattice . however , due to the high connectivity of the neurons it is necessary to use complex networks to describe the properties of neuronal assemblies .",
    "these complex networks can be viewed in two basic levels : a microscopic , neuroanatomic level , and a macroscopic , functional level .",
    "studies in the former level are limited to those few examples in which there is available data on the neuronal connectivity , as the worm _ c. elegans",

    "scannell and coworkers have investigated the anatomical connectivity matrix of the visual cortex for the macaque monkey and the cat @xcite .",
    "the basic elements of a complex network are nodes and links .",
    "a link connects two or more nodes , and these connections can be unidirectional or bidirectional . in the language of neuronal networks a node can be either a single neuron or a cortical area , depending on the level of characterization .",
    "if we consider a microscopic description the links are synapses ( electrical or chemical ) , whereas they are axonal fibers in networks of cortical areas or simply they stand for the functional relationship between the corresponding regions in the cortex .",
    "a complex network can be characterized by various topological and metrical properties @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we will need only two of them : the average path length @xmath65 and the average clustering coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "the path length between two nodes @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the minimum number of links that must be traversed through the network to travel from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "the average path length @xmath65 is the path length averaged over all pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "the average clustering coefficient @xmath66 of a network is defined as the average fractions of pairs of neighbors of a given node which happen also to be neighbors of each other @xcite .",
    "for example , if a node @xmath67 is connected to nodes @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and if @xmath68 and @xmath69 are themselves connected , then @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 form a triangular cluster .",
    "the value of @xmath66 turns to be the fraction of triangular clusters that exist in the network with respect to the total possible number of such clusters .    from the graph - theoretical perspective",
    "a complex network can be described by an adjacency matrix @xmath43 , whose elements are equal to the unity if the nodes are connected and zero otherwise . in studies of cortical area networks , both in the anatomic and functional levels , each link is sometimes given a specific weight , which can be even time - varying in investigations of plasticity .",
    "since we discard self - interactions , the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix are zero .      in a globally coupled network",
    "all nodes are connected with all other nodes . since in this case",

    "@xmath78 we considered averages over @xmath79 different realizations of the initial pattern .    in both cases the behavior is qualitatively similar : for small coupling values there is no bursting synchronization and , after a critical coupling value @xmath80 we begin to observe partial synchronization and , further on , complete phase synchronization .",

    "we can define a geometrical phase for coupled rulkov neurons , such that bursting synchronization is equivalent to some form of phase synchronization . using the time rate of the bursting phase we can define a bursting frequency and thus investigate frequency synchronization in such networks .    using a complex order parameter",

    "the existence of a phase reduction for the coupled rulkov neuron system suggests the usefulness of a generalized kuramoto model which , in the present context , can be considered a minimal model for bursting neurons .",
    "we presented in this paper some quantitative results that justify this claim . in order to compare both models , however , it is necessary to adjust the corresponding probability distribution functions for the natural frequencies .",
