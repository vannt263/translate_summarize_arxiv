    "the measurement of forward jets provides an important testing ground for qcd predictions of the standard model in the low - x region .",
    "the lhc ( large hadron collider ) can reach @xmath1 and @xmath2 values previously inaccessible to hera as displayed in figure [ fig : intro ] . to access the low - x region one must look at high rapidity .",
    "for such task the rapidity coverage of up to @xmath3 = 5.2 in cms @xcite has been used .        the jet  rapidity and transverse ",
    "momenta is well described by the calculations at next - to- leading - order ( nlo ) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) using the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite approach and collinear factorization .",
    "the dijet cross - section is also well described @xcite . when the collision energy @xmath0 is considerably larger than the hard scattering scale given by the jet transverse momentum , @xmath4 , calculations in perturbative qcd require a resummation of large @xmath5 terms .",
    "this leads to the prediction of new dynamic effects , expected to be described by balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution @xcite and @xmath6 factorization @xcite .",
    "an effective theory has been developed which describes strong interactions in this kinematic domain @xcite .",
    "this description is particularly useful in events with several jets with large rapidity separation , which are not well described by dglap predictions .    to extend the study of the parton evolution equations ,",
    "the azimuthal angle differences were also measured .",
    "this observable has a sensitivity to bfkl effects when both jets are widely separated in rapidity ( eg : mueller - navelet jets ) .",
    "the inclusive forward jet cross - section was measured from an integrated luminosity of 3.14 @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "jets were reconstructed with the anti-@xmath6 clustering algorithm @xcite with a distance parameter r = @xmath8 = 0.5 .",
    "the energy depositions in the calorimeter cells were used as input for the clustering .",
    "assuming massless jets , a four  momentum is associated with them by summing the energy of the cells above a given threshold .",
    "the forward region is defined as 3.2 @xmath9 4.7 .",
    "the jets are required to have a transverse momentum above @xmath4 = 35 gev .",
    "if more than one jet is present , the one with with highest @xmath4 is considered , as is illustrated in figure [ fig : feynman_inclusive_forward ] .",
    "the jets are corrected for the following systematic effects : @xmath10 and @xmath11dependent response of the calorimeters , overlap with other proton  proton interactions and the migration of events across the @xmath4 bins due to jet energy resolution .        in figure",
    "[ fig : inclusive_forward_unc ] the experimental systematic uncertainties are shown for the leading forward jet as function of @xmath10 . the jet energy scale is the dominant systematic uncertainty and the total uncertainty is around -25 + 30% .        the inclusive forward jet production cross ",
    "section corrected to hadron level is presented in figure [ fig : inclusive_forward ] .",
    "although all predictions describe the data within the uncertainty band , some of them do better .",
    "powheg  @xcite  + pythia  6  @xcite gives the best description .",
    "pythia 6 and pythia 8  @xcite describe the data reasonably well .",
    "cascade  @xcite underestimates the cross - section while herwig 6  @xcite + jimmy  @xcite tends to overestimate .",
    "nlojet++ overestimates the data but is still within the large theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "the selection procedure for the simultaneous forward  central dijet production is similar to the one for for the inclusive forward jet production . in addition , a central jet within @xmath12 2.8 with a transverse momentum above @xmath10 = 35 gev is required .",
    "a feynman diagram of the process is shown in figure [ fig : feymamn_forwardcentral ] .",
    "several mc predictions compared to the data cross - section is presented in figures [ fig : forwardcentral1 ] and [ fig : forwardcentral2 ]  @xcite . forward",
    "jet cross - section is steeper than the central jet .",
    "the shape of the forward jet is poorly described when compared with the central jet .",
    "hej  @xcite provides the best description being followed closely by herwig 6 and herwig + +  @xcite .",
    "both pythia 6 , pythia 8 and the ccfm cascade have troubles describing the data for the central jets and for low @xmath10 forward jets .",
    "powheg + pythia 6 , which was the best prediction for inclusive forward jet production , yelds similar result as pythia 6 alone .",
    "the reconstruction and correction procedure is similar as for the inclusive forward jet production  @xcite .",
    "mueller - navelet jets are the dijet pair with the highest rapidity separation . in this analysis only jets with @xmath10 above 35 gev and @xmath13 4.7 were considered .",
    "the azimuthal angle decorrelations of jets widely separated in rapidity is presented in figures [ fig : azimuthal_decorrelations1 ] and [ fig : azimuthal_decorrelations2 ] as function of rapidity separation .",
    "the first row of figure [ fig : azimuthal_decorrelations1 ] displays the azimuthal angle difference @xmath14 for jets with a rapidity separation @xmath15 less than 3 .",
    "pythia 6 and herwig + + describe the data within uncertainties , while pythia 8 and sherpa 1.4  @xcite with parton matrix elements matched show deviations at small and intermediate @xmath14 .",
    "the second row shows @xmath14 for a rapidity separation between 3 and 6 .",
    "herwig + + provides the best description , but all predictions show deviation beyond the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the last row shows the azimuthal  angle difference for @xmath15 between 6 and 9 .",
    "the dijets are strongly decorrelated .",
    "herwig + + provides the best description while pythia 6 and pythia 8 fail for the lower @xmath14 region .    the figure [ fig : azimuthal_decorrelations2 ] shows @xmath14 for mueller - navelet jets with different rapidity separations compared with with different pythia 6 predictions .",
    "the contributions of the angular ordering ( ao ) and multi  parton interactions ( mpi ) are very similar .",
    "the intermediate @xmath15 region is better described without mpi .",
    "overall the data is better described with ao and mpi .",
