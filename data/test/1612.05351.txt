    "astrophysical studies since the 1960s have provided a solid foundation for the physics of disk evolution and planetesimal formation .",
    "the core accretion model proposed by @xcite and @xcite , for example , has become part of the standard theory for planetary formation ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , the problem of meter - size barrier , i.e. , infall of dust caused by headwind @xcite , still forms a considerable impediment to planetary formation .",
    "it is crucial to understand how to create planetesimals out of newly condensed dust particles , because the failure to form planetesimals would leave little chance for subsequent planetary formation .",
    "a number of models have been proposed to overcome this difficulty , including efficient sticking @xcite , mid - plane gravitational instability @xcite , and streaming instability @xcite , but no consensus has been reached yet .",
    "different mechanisms could result in disparate chemical structures and thus different implications for cosmochemistry @xcite .",
    "the very first prerequisite for planetesimal formation is the settling of particles towards the disk mid - plane .",
    "most of the models proposed to overcome the meter - size barrier require a higher dust - to - gas ratio than expected from the solar abundance , and dust concentration through vertical settling is one of the source mechanisms @xcite .",
    "evaluating the timescale for settling is thus essential when considering the subsequent evolution .",
    "calculations assuming a laminar disk suggest the time scale of @xmath210@xmath1  years , which is shorter than that of radial disk evolution @xcite .",
    "disk turbulence could potentially inhibit the dust growth , resulting in slow settling @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation of aggregates would also contribute to maintain small dust size and slow settling @xcite .",
    "the effect of chemistry on settling , however , has not been considered in previous studies , although it could play an important role in an early evolutionary stage .",
    "when dust grains settle through a vertical temperature gradient , the stable phases of dust - composing elements are likely to change , and even the existence of dust itself is not always guaranteed . using thermodynamic database , condensing species can be calculated at a given pressure and temperature @xcite .",
    "this allows us to predict the evolution of dust - composing species as the grains settle , but previous studies on disk evolution have rarely incorporated this thermodynamic constraint on dust settling .    by building a simple thermodynamically - consistent model , we will quantify the effects of chemistry on vertical dust settling in protoplanetary disks , which is one of the most fundamental processes in planetary formation .",
    "our approach is notable at least for the following two points .",
    "first , dust properties are calculated through gibbs free energy minimization rather than using condensation temperature .",
    "second , the disk thermal structure is calculated using the opacity information consistent with results from gibbs free energy minimization .",
    "the existence of dust will affect the opacity by orders of magnitude , thus affecting the overall temperature structure .",
    "such temperature change will feed directly back to the chemistry , possibly altering the stable phases , and further modifying the opacity .",
    "thus , opacity is a key parameter connecting physics and chemistry , being crucial to make our calculations fully self - consistent .",
    "the purpose of this study is to demonstrate quantitatively this feedback between physics and chemistry during the dust settling process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , a theoretical formulation for the interaction between mechanics and condensation is described in detail .",
    "modeling results then follow , exhibiting profound differences from classical calculations .",
    "implications for astronomical and cosmochemical studies are discussed , including the time scale for dust settling and the trends of element abundance recorded in various meteorites .",
    "previous radial evolution models involving both astrophysics and cosmochemistry are discussed as well .",
    "our model calculates one - dimensional ( 1-d ) dust settling , tracking the temporal and spatial evolution of dust amount and composition at an early stage of a protoplanetary disk in the terrestrial region .",
    "viscous dissipation is likely to cause an increase in temperature towards the mid - plane in the vertical direction .",
    "the chemical compositions of dust and coexisting gas at different heights will reflect such a temperature variation , and the amount of dust and its composition will also evolve as the grains settle .",
    "our calculations are centered on the following radiative heat transfer equation @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 is the height from the mid - plane , @xmath6 is the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath7 is the background gas density , @xmath8 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath9 is the vertical radiation flux .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity is sensitive to dust amount , and the physics and chemistry of dust settling are connected through this opacity term .",
    "our model considers a system spanning from the mid - plane to five times the initial pressure scale height . at the outer edge of our model , therefore , the gas density is only 10@xmath10 of that at the mid - plane , and the temperature is expected to become roughly constant above the outer edge .",
    "the evolution of gas density is solved using a radial evolution model , independently from dust settling .",
    "the model is spatially discretized uniformly ; density , temperature , and gas composition are calculated for each grid cell , whereas a tracer - based method is used to solve the settling of dust grains and their composition .",
    "tracer particles , representing the dust size and the composition of a nearby region , are allocated in each grid cell . the evolution of dust density distribution",
    "is tracked by tracer particles , whose evolution is solved through the combination of classical physics and condensation theory . in our model ,",
    "the equation of motion , the radiative heat transfer equation , dust opacity , and gibbs free energy minimization are solved sequentially . at each time step , we ( 1 ) populate tracer particles carrying the composition of nearby grains , ( 2 ) settle dust grains according to the equation of motion , ( 3 ) solve radiative heat transfer and gibbs free energy minimization simultaneously to obtain a new temperature profile and chemical composition . the detailed description of each step is given below .",
    "dust motion is assumed to be controlled by the solar gravity and the epstein drag @xcite .",
    "all the dust grains are assumed to be spherical and have no porous space inside , to focus on the effect of condensation .",
    "for an early - stage , high - temperature regime under consideration , this assumption is likely to be valid .",
    "the settling speed of dust particles reaches a terminal velocity in a time scale of a few seconds for grain size of @xmath21  @xmath11 m .",
    "therefore , all the grains are assumed to settle in the terminal velocity proportional to grain size given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the material dust density , @xmath14 is the grain size , and @xmath15 is the local keplerian angular velocity @xcite .",
    "the mean thermal speed of molecules is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean gas molecular mass and @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the temperature distribution is solved using the radiative transfer equation : equation  ( [ dt / dz ] ) supplemented with @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the disk .",
    "the viscosity is scaled using the @xmath21-prescription of @xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath24 is the pressure scale height , and @xmath21 is the constant to account for the undetermined mechanism for viscosity .",
    "observations of t - tauri stars suggest @xmath25 @xcite , whereas the recent studies of purely hydrodynamic turbulence imply @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we employ the values between @xmath27 and @xmath28 to account for this uncertainty . whereas the value of @xmath21 may vary vertically depending on the source mechanism of viscosity , including the existence of dead zone @xcite , a constant value of @xmath21 along all height is adopter here . during the early stage of disk evolution ,",
    "the terrestrial region is hot enough so that the gas is partially ionized , and a vertically uniform turbulence is likely to be generated .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity of dust particles is calculated through the mie - scattering code of @xcite using the refractive index data of silicates @xcite .",
    "the opacity varies with the amount of dust and its grain size @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of opacity is ignored here , because it is weak compared to the effect of dust size and amount .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity is plotted as a function of grain size in figure  [ fig_op ] .",
    "dust particles of 1  @xmath11 m size have the largest opacity for near - infrared radiation .",
    "the grain size affects both opacity and settling speed , playing a crucial role in our model .",
    "when the dust first condenses , dust grains are assumed to nucleate homogeneously .",
    "for the initial grain size , we test a range of values spanning from 0.1  @xmath11 m to 10  @xmath11 m .",
    "the lower bound is taken from a typical interstellar grain size , and the upper bound is estimated from the mean free path , @xmath29 , and the thermal velocity of molecules , @xmath30 , assuming perfect aggregation at each collision .",
    "here we considered that two molecules or particles collide at an every interval of @xmath31 , and they always form an aggregate without bouncing . as molecules collide and stick , the number density becomes smaller and the interval of collision takes longer .",
    "one - hundredth of the time step ( see section  [ imple ] ) is considered as the nucleation time scale , which is @xmath25 to 100 years in our calculations , and this gives the upper bound of 10  @xmath11 m as an initial nucleation size .",
    "given the assumption of perfect aggregation , it should be considered as an unlikely end - member case .",
    "this range covers the typical grain size of matrix materials ( 50  nm - 5  @xmath11 m ) in chondrites @xcite , which could be considered as the typical size of unmelted grains .",
    "grain growth occurs through additional condensation on existing grains ; i.e. , the number of dust particle is conserved by assuming heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "grain fragmentation , sticking , and dust size distribution are not considered in our model , and this simplification turns out to be justified a posteriori for most cases , as discussed in section  4 .",
    "equations ( [ dt / dz ] ) and ( [ dfz / dz ] ) are integrated from the disk surface towards the mid - plane .",
    "the surface temperature , @xmath32 , is used as a boundary condition and is converted from the effective temperature of the disk , @xmath33 , assuming that the disk is opaque to blackbody radiation due to the existence of @xmath11m - size grains .",
    "these temperatures are given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the disk surface density @xcite . here the effective temperature is calculated by balancing viscous dissipation and blackbody radiation .",
    "the amounts of dust and its average chemical compositions at different heights in the system are calculated through gibbs free energy minimization .",
    "the disk temperature and pressure are necessary to determine stable phases , and the pressure is calculated assuming the ideal gas law ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "previous settling models have fixed the total dust amount in the system ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but our model determines the amount based on condensation calculation , making the model consistent with evolving chemistry .",
    "we have developed an original optimization method to minimize the free energy using a non - linear conjugate gradient method ( see appendix a for detail ) .",
    "only major elements ( h , o , na , mg , al , si , ca , and fe ) are considered in equilibrium calculations in this study .",
    "mineral species considered include corundum , melilite , spinel , olivine , and pyroxene .",
    "the complete list of species considered is given in table  [ spec ] .",
    "thermodynamical data for silicates phases are taken from @xcite , and those for the rest of phases are from the janaf thermochemical tables .",
    "tracers are distributed uniformly in each grid cell at each time step , and they carry the information of dust amount and component in the nearby region . unlike conventional tracer methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the number density of tracers in our model does not correspond to the concentration of any kind .",
    "suppose that we populate @xmath38  tracers uniformly in one grid cell at @xmath5 and denote each tracer as @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "the tracer  @xmath39 contains the total mass , average size , and average composition of all dust grains existing between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the grid size .",
    "the tracers advect according to the settling velocity at each height . unlike grid - based methods",
    ", tracer method would not cause any numerical diffusion , thereby being able to calculate the settling accurately .",
    "although heterogeneous nucleation could cause the grain size to increase , a change in size is relatively small in our calculations , and no grains would overrun preceding grains .",
    "the distributions of temperature and dust composition are calculated based on this advected composition profile , using radiative heat transfer and gibbs free energy minimization simultaneously .",
    "after the settling is completed , we compute the average dust composition of each grid cell , by taking into account all of tracer particles in each cell . at this point , tracers still carry the dust composition calculated from the temperature profile at the previous time step .",
    "gibbs free energy minimization is then performed using the temperature and pressure at the upper node of the cell in order to obtain the new dust composition consistent with the new temperature profile . as we integrate the heat transfer equation from the disk surface to the mid - plane",
    ", the upper node is always updated first , and the upper node temperature corresponds to the new temperature for the cell .",
    "the temperature of the lower node of that cell is acquired by integrating equations  ( [ dt / dz ] ) and ( [ dfz / dz ] ) , using the opacity based on the dust amount obtained from free energy minimization .",
    "when a grid cell has high dust density , however , a large opacity value of the cell could result in a substantial temperature difference between the upper and lower nodes of the grid .",
    "dust grains might not be able to remain in a solid phase anymore and evaporate at the lower end of the cell .",
    "however , using a single large opacity value will not account for this compositional variation and will result in an unrealistically high temperature at the lower node . in this case , we subdivide the grid cell and recalculate temperature and composition with higher resolution .",
    "we continue this grid refinement until additional subdivision changes the temperature of the lower node by less than 1  k. in this manner , the dust profile will be consistent with both radiative heat transfer and chemical thermodynamics .",
    "we used 100  grid cells ( size of 0.05  scale height ) and 20  tracer particles per grid cell .",
    "this particular choice of discretization is sufficient for our purpose , as shown later .",
    "the time step , @xmath44 , is chosen so that @xmath45 for the bottom 95% of dust grains by mass .",
    "the surface density @xmath36 is solved using a 1-d radial disk evolution model , derived from mass and angular momentum conservation laws , @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is time , and @xmath48 is the radial distance from the sun @xcite .",
    "the viscosity  @xmath20 is again described by the @xmath21-prescription .",
    "the disk temperature , necessary to compute the sound speed and thus the viscosity , is calculated using equation  ( [ teff ] ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "equation  ( [ sigma ] ) is solved independently from the settling calculation , because dust settling in our model only causes a small difference on the mid - disk temperature and thus the viscosity .",
    "the vertical gas density profile is assumed to satisfy a hydrostatic equilibrium , and the surface density is converted to the vertical profile through @xmath49 the background gas density is assumed to vary temporally in proportion to the change of the surface density . in our model calculations ,",
    "the gas composition is modified only through in situ and vertical processes such as condensation and dust settling , and we do not explicitly model the effect of radial transport on the gas composition .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming a similar chemical composition in the nearby region , and thus the radial mass flux into the system would not modify the gas composition .",
    "the evolution of gas surface density is calculated first using the radial disk evolution model of equation  ( [ sigma ] ) , before solving the settling .",
    "the surface temperature is converted from the surface density using equation  ( [ teff ] ) , and its evolution at 1  au and 4  au is plotted in figure  [ fig_te1 ] .",
    "the timescale for disk evolution decreases inversely with the value of @xmath21 , which is proportional to viscosity .",
    "the evolution depends strongly also on an initial density profile , which is poorly constrained as well . in this study , we test two two initial disk masses , 0.35 and 0.5 solar mass , with a surface density profile inversely proportional to the distance from the sun @xcite , spanning up to 25  au ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the surface density at 1  au ) .",
    "we used three values of @xmath21 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath28 ) combined with two values of surface density @xmath51 ( 2.0 @xmath54 10@xmath0 and 3.0 @xmath54 10@xmath0 kg m@xmath55 , corresponding to 0.35@xmath56 and 0.5@xmath56 , respectively ) .",
    "we calculated the behavior of dust settlings at 1  au to 5  au with various parameter combinations .",
    "initially , our model has the solar composition of @xcite at all heights .",
    "when the disk interior is hot enough , si , mg , and fe evaporate , and when it is even hotter , al and ca also start to exist as gas phases . as we are considering an early stage of disk evolution ,",
    "viscous heating is a major heat source of the disk , and the radiation from the sun has a negligible effect .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath21 , viscous heating is one to three orders of magnitude larger than the heat flux from the solar radiation , which is 3  w  m@xmath55 at 1  au assuming a flat disk @xcite .",
    "this leads to an increase in temperature towards the mid - plane .",
    "dust first precipitates in the cooler upper region of the disk , and it sinks toward the mid - plane due to the gravity from the sun .",
    "the settling of micron - size particles is slow , but it gradually increases the dust - to - gas ratio in the lower region . in the inner region of the disk , if the value of @xmath21 is high enough , dust particles re - evaporate as they sink into the hotter interior and are prevented from further settling .",
    "figure  [ fig_set1 ] shows some snapshots for the profiles of temperature and dust composition .",
    "the evaporation of dust particles creates a concentration of dust - composing elements .",
    "this leads to the formation of a dust - rich layer with high opacity , creating a large temperature gradient .",
    "any dust grain trying to cross this temperature jump will be subjected to evaporation , which prevents the grain from settling further ( figure  [ fig_set1](a ) ) .",
    "this forms a `` condensation front '' , where dust particles concentrate due to a temperature jump created by themselves .",
    "figure  [ fig_set1](c ) shows that mg , si , and fe are concentrated above the condensation front at @xmath22.5  times the scale height at @xmath57 year , because these elements all condense in a short range of temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig_set1](b ) shows a pair of condensation and evaporation occurring above and below the front . when the total evaporated amount is larger than 10% of the total condensed amount , a condensation front is defined to have formed . the tracer method allows us to resolve condensation and evaporation within a single grid cell .",
    "all of our calculations were made with 100  grid cells and 20  tracer particles per grid , but a finer grid resolution or a denser tracer population does not change our results significantly . table  [ conv ]",
    "lists the values of the mid - disk temperature at @xmath58 years obtained by varying the grid size and the number of tracers per cell .",
    "the front descends slowly with the same settling speeds as dust particles .",
    "repeating evaporation and condensation will keep the grain size in its initial nucleation size .",
    "some grains might go through collisional sticking and grow in size , but such larger grains would settle faster into a hotter region , ending up with evaporation .",
    "the condensation front and the associated temperature jump will be sustained by the remaining smaller particles .",
    "this justifies our strategy of neglecting grain growth in our calculations .",
    "some representative temporal model evolutions at 1  au are shown in figure  [ fig_tev ] . as time proceeds , the average temperature decreases , and dust mass increases . by comparing the cases with @xmath59 and @xmath60  kg  m@xmath55",
    ", it can be seen that a higher surface density results in a hotter interior , keeping more dust - composing elements in the gas phase . for both cases",
    ", however , the ratio of evaporated and condensed amounts converges to almost unity , indicating that the amounts evaporating below and condensing above the front are nearly equal .",
    "the amount of dust is self - regulated below a certain value so that it would not create too large a temperature increase to prohibit the existence of the dust altogether , resulting in the ratio of evaporated and condensed close to unity .",
    "therefore , the settling of the condensation front could be even slower than the settling of individual dust particles . a larger initial nucleation size of 10  @xmath11 m or a smaller viscosity of @xmath27 would result in a lower mid - disk temperature , and thus it would take longer to form a condensation front with the ratio close to unity , but the front still forms after a certain period of time .    in the outer terrestrial region , a different kind of model evolution is observed ( figure  [ fig_tev3 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of evaporated and condensed would never be larger than unity , but some fraction of dust is still evaporating due to the formation of the front . even for the case of @xmath61 and @xmath62  kg  m@xmath55 , the ratio rapidly decreases , due to its short radial evolution timescale .",
    "this is the case with the highest viscosity and the highest initial disk density among the parameter combinations considered in this study , so it has the highest potential to sustain a condensation front .",
    "the model with @xmath63 has a lower mid - disk temperature from the beginning , so the ratio also quickly decreases close to zero .",
    "another rise in the ratio can be seen after 5 @xmath54 10@xmath0 years , and this is caused by the condensation front formed by na and si , which condense at lower temperatures ( figure  [ fig_setn ] ) .",
    "the temperature decreases slowly compared to the case with @xmath61 , and this leaves a room for a lower - temperature condensation front . because na has a small mass fraction compared to other major elements , it only has a minor effect on the evolution of the mid - disk temperature .",
    "the settling slows down as it approaches the mid - plane , because the settling speed is inversely proportional to the background gas density ( equation  ( [ vset ] ) ) .",
    "both the surface and mid - disk temperatures gradually cool down as viscous heating decreases along with the dissipation of the nebular gas .",
    "the disk interior , where most of the mass exists , remains hotter than the condensation temperatures of mg , si , and fe due to the condensation front , whereas the region closer to the surface cools down within a few thousands of years . in all the cases , highly refractory species ( corundum and melilite )",
    "do not form a condensation front .",
    "this is because ca- and al - bearing grains do not have a sufficient amount to form a front , and also because they only condense in the hot inner region , where it has too little radiation flux to form a temperature jump . the temperature gradient is proportional to the radiation flux , which is smaller in the interior .",
    "the absence of a ca or al condensation front suggests that highly refractory species settle without being affected by evolving chemistry .",
    "it is likely that ca and al dust settle simply following classical mechanics , and it is necessary to consider the grain - size evolution in a more careful manner .",
    "the formation of the condensation front inhibits dust settling , resulting in an extended settling timescale , which is comparable to that of radial evolution . at 1  au",
    ", the condensation front would last as long as @xmath64  years for @xmath65 , and @xmath66  years for @xmath61 with the initial nucleation size of 1  @xmath11 m , whereas the radial evolution occur in @xmath67  years .",
    "whether dust accumulates near the mid - plane or not has a large impact on subsequent evolution processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the effect of the condensation front could be potentially crucial .",
    "figure  [ fig_sum ] summarizes the condition for the formation of a condensation front as a function of the value of @xmath21 and the distance from the sun . when the value of @xmath21 is larger than 10@xmath68 , it is highly likely that a condensation front forms in the terrestrial region .",
    "if the initial nucleation size is limited to around 1  @xmath11 m , the condensation front could form as far as in the asteroid belt region ( figure  [ fig_sum](b ) ) . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the region spans even further close to the jovian orbit . even if the initial nucleation size is as small as interstellar grains or as large as 10  @xmath11 m , the existence of front is likely at @xmath69 . the front forms with a higher possibility when grains with 1  @xmath11 m exist , because the opacity and thus the mid - disk temperature are the highest at 1  @xmath11 m ( figure  [ fig_op ] ) . given that the initial nucleation size would exhibit some finite distribution in reality , a small amount of dust with 1  @xmath11 m",
    "is expected to always exist , which would contribute to the formation of the front .",
    "the formation of condensation front could well be ubiquitous in the inner terrestrial region , causing the slow settling of dust grains .",
    "the existence of dust grains , which is necessary for the subsequent evolution to take place , is controlled by thermodynamics . in early protoplanetary disks ,",
    "it is likely that silicates evaporated in the terrestrial planet region @xcite , and it would be essential to consider the complex evolution caused by condensation .",
    "our results indicate a substantially longer timescale for dust settling compared with the standard theory of planetary formation @xcite .",
    "the standard theory suggests that dust grains settle in the order of a few thousand years and grow into mm - size by the time they reach the mid - plane .",
    "when condensation is considered , however , our study shows that the fate of dust settling can be more complex , affected by the formation of a condensation front and its slow descent .",
    "dust concentrates above the front forming a temperature jump , and dust would not be able to penetrate this temperature jump created by itself . evaporation and condensation would repeat at the front , keeping the dust size in its initial nucleation size .",
    "a condensation front survives until viscous dissipation becomes weak .",
    "eventually , metallic iron , forsterite , and enstatite become stable near the cold mid - plane , and no evaporation will happen after that .",
    "even with a large initial grain size of 10  @xmath11 m , the settling takes @xmath210@xmath0  years at 1  au , which is two orders of magnitude longer than classical estimates , and with an initial size of 1  @xmath11 m , it takes longer than half a million years . in the meantime",
    ", some fraction of dust composing elements would dissipate as gas , without becoming planetesimals .",
    "this could potentially change the estimate of the minimum solar nebular mass .",
    "the prolonged time scale for dust settling will also change the interval between the formation times of cai and planets , because planet formation is not likely to start until dust settles to the mid - plane .",
    "this may affect our understanding of the solar system chronology .    repeating evaporation and condensation limit the dust size to around the initial nucleation size , which again differs from the grain size predicted from pure mechanics .",
    "this could possibly explain the dominance of @xmath11m - size particles in the disks inferred from some astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "the observation of a region where a condensation front forms should show the dominance of @xmath11m - dust .",
    "what we would observe from the earth should correspond to the surface of micron - size dust - rich layer since dust is depleted in the overlying region of the front .",
    "condensation front will last for an order of radial evolution time scale , which makes @xmath11m - size dust observable for a prolonged time .",
    "this explanation , however , holds only for disks with a hot interior , while many observations of @xmath11m - size particles in cold disks also exist .",
    "the fragmentation of large - size dust aggregates could also replenish small grains , resulting in the existence of @xmath11m - size dust and slow settling @xcite .",
    "although it is neglected in our calculation , turbulent mixing could relax the concentration of dust , along with the steep temperature jump , at the condensation front .",
    "a gradual increase of temperature will still cause dust grains to evaporate at the end of the temperature jump , and repeating condensation and evaporation are likely to happen , meaning that the suppression of grain size will still occur .",
    "if turbulence is weak enough in such a upper layer , the concentration of dust above the front may even cause the layer to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "the degree of viscous turbulence could be complex depending on the source mechanism , although it is simply characterized by a constant parameter @xmath21 in this study .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for most of our cases , since the regions considered here are the hot inner part of the disks , which remain hotter than 1000  k , leading the gas to be ionized through collision .",
    "this assumption , however , could be invalid in the outer cold region .",
    "future studies are warranted to address these important complications .",
    "various element abundances recorded in chondrites have shown a depletion trend correlating with their volatility , and its origin has been debated for the past several decades @xcite .",
    "the elements with condensation temperatures between that of silicon and sulfur in particular have shown a clear trend @xcite , and this trend has been called the depletion of moderately volatile elements ( move ) .",
    "quite a few cosmochemical models have tried to explain the move depletion based on the idea of incomplete condensation , i.e. , fractional condensation in a gradually cooling and dissipating protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , for example , used an analytical disk model to calculate the move depletion trend , and his model has succeeded in reproducing the observed trend .",
    "however , the result changes substantially just by incorporating the infall of dust caused by headwind @xcite , and other mechanisms suggested by astrophysical theory , such as turbulence and grain size evolution , have also been neglected in these analytical disk models .",
    "the abundance of refractory elements , such as the al / si and mg / si ratios , have not been fully explained as well .",
    "most of chondrites show similar values of al / si and mg / si to those of the solar photosphere @xcite . however , if , for some period of time , the nebula has been hotter than the si condensation temperature , gas containing si would have dissipated , while al would have remained in the nebula as solid . under the framework of incomplete condensation ,",
    "therefore , it should leave a depletion trend not only in volatile elements , but also in refractory elements . when the al / si ratio is calculated using the approach of @xcite ,",
    "al / si is predicted to be at least factor of  2  higher than that of ci chondrites .",
    "furthermore , ordinary and enstatite chondrites show depletion in al , which is one of the most refractory elements .",
    "this could not be explained by incomplete condensation .",
    "figure  [ fig_me ] plots the molar ratios of al / si and mg / si for various types of chondrites .",
    "the lack of a depletion trend between al and si indicates either that the highest temperature achieved in the disk must have been below the condensation temperature of si ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or that the incomplete condensation hypothesis is neglecting some important mechanisms .",
    "astrophysical models , however , show that all the elements including refractory elements might have evaporated around 1  au when the mass accretion rate is larger than @xmath70 yr@xmath71 @xcite , which is a typical accretion rate for the disk at an early phase .",
    "our dust settling model may bring a new insight into the depletion trend observed in chondrites . in the framework of incomplete condensation",
    ", it seems inevitable to produce a depletion of si , if the terrestrial region exceeds the condensation temperature of si .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , corundum and gehlenite do not form a condensation front , which indicates that al and ca bearing refractory grains would not evaporate even if they settle below the condensation front . because their grain growth is not likely to be limited by the front",
    ", it will stick to each other and grow in size .",
    "particles larger than cm - size tend to decouple from the gas and drift inward in a short time scale @xcite .",
    "whereas dust bearing mg , si , and fe is suppressed to @xmath11m - size above the condensation front , refractory grains are likely to drift inward , and they would either concentrate in the inner region or fall into the sun . therefore ,",
    "as long as the infall of materials does not end up in the region under consideration , dust grains remaining above the condensation front are likely to be the planet - forming materials in the region . for the sake of discussion",
    ", we assume that planets would have the same composition with what is left above the front and compare it with the al / si and mg / si ratios of chondrites . as seen in figure  [ fig_me ] , the composition above the condensation front can exhibit a significant depletion in both al and mg , and its compositional variation can cover from ordinary to enstatite chondrites .",
    "most of al - rich dust particles would penetrate through the front and settle towards the mid - plane , though those associated with albite ( naalsi@xmath72o@xmath73 ) could remain above the front .",
    "the amount of al is thus determined by albite , but when condensation front forms further up from the mid - plane in the hot inner disk , and the formation and settling of corundum ( al@xmath74o@xmath72 ) would only leave a small fraction of al left for albite to form .",
    "therefore , al above the front will be smaller in those cases , resulting in a stronger depletion .",
    "the composition of earth has long been considered to be chondritic except for volatile elements @xcite , but quite a few geochemical data are showing the possibility of a non - chondritic origin @xcite .",
    "these studies suggested the necessity of a non - chondritic reservoir to explain the bulk silicate earth ( bse ) , but how to create such a reservoir has been controversial .",
    "however , our idea of condensation front might naturally explain a possible difference between chondrites and the earth .",
    "when refractory elements are transported inward , the enrichment of refractory elements in the inner region will occur together with the depletion in the outer region , the result of which might lead to the enrichment observed in bse @xcite and the depletion in ordinary chondrites .",
    "chondrites that formed further out where the condensation front did not form would not go through such enrichment nor depletion , and therefore , abundances close to ci chondrites are likely to be recorded .",
    "how far the condensation front formed can not sharply be constrained because of the uncertainty of disk parameters , but the boundary likely exists between 2  and  5  au , which corresponds to the source region of chondrites . in some cases ,",
    "na and si also formed a condensation front ( figure  [ fig_setn ] ) , potentially providing another mechanism to modify the abundance of move .      with our 1-d dust settling model , the al / si and mg / si ratios can not be discussed in a quantitative manner , because the effect of radial drift has yet to be considered .",
    "our model , however , has shown the importance of the physical effect of condensation in the theory of planet formation , and we plan to consider the effects of grain growth and turbulence and to expand the model to 2-d in the future .",
    "although both turbulence and grain growth have small effects on vertical dust settling , they are likely to be important in radial models .",
    "turbulence would only smear out the temperature and dust peaks at the condensation front in our current vertical model , but it could cause a substantial transport of mass in the radial model .",
    "grain growth during vertical dust settling was suppressed by a condensation front , but it would not be the case in a 2-d model .",
    "grain growth could cause the variations of grain structure and surface composition , both of which could affect the opacity to some extent @xcite .",
    "some of the previous astrophysical models have already studied the effect of condensation on radial evolution .",
    "they showed that the effects of evaporation as dust grains drift inward could lead to an order - magnitude enhancement of evaporated element concentration in the vicinity of condensation temperature @xcite .",
    "however , most of the existing astrophysical models still treat condensation temperatures as if they were constant , although they may change by 100 - 200  k as pressure changes spatially and temporarily throughout the disk .",
    "the enhancement of dust / gas ratio or the concentration of certain elements could also affect condensation temperatures significantly ( @xcite ; see also appendix  a ) .",
    "moreover , most of the astrophysical models classify dust into only two classes , i.e. , ice and silicate , although this treatment will lose the important information of condensing minerals , hindering the quantitative comparison with meteoritic data .",
    "some other radial models that tried to relate to cosmochemistry ( e.g. , @xcite ) have used an analytical disk model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this ignores the effect of evolving dust composition on opacity .",
    "opacity is sensitive to grain size , shape , and its composition , and it should be calculated by honoring the disk environment @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "the effect of chemistry on dust migration is taken into account accurately by thermodynamic calculations , and the evolution of compositional variation within the disk is fed back to the dynamics of disk evolution through opacity calculation , making the calculation fully self - consistent . by comparing results from our future 2-d models with the meteoritic data , we may be able to estimate some disk parameters such as initial density profile , viscosity , and grain size evolution , all of which are still highly unknown . to extract such astrophysical constraints from cosmochemical data ,",
    "it is of utmost importance to develop a new theory of protoplanetary disks , which is consistent with both physics and chemistry .",
    "we constructed a vertical dust settling model by incorporating the effects of chemistry to the classical physical model of dust settling in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we showed that dust grains evaporate as they settle towards the hotter interior and cause the concentration of dust - composing elements .",
    "this leads to the formation of a condensation front .",
    "concentrated dust grains act as a high opacity layer , generating a large temperature increase , which hampers further dust settling by evaporation .",
    "the formation of a condensation front is ubiquitous at around 1  au and could exist even at as far as 4  au depending on the choice of disk parameters .",
    "the existence of the front would significantly change the timescale of dust settling and also cause highly refractory grains ( with al or ca ) and moderately refractory grains ( with mg , si , or fe ) to settle in different modes . moderately refractory grains with mg ,",
    "si , and fe would form a condensation front and settle in a long timescale , but grains with al and ca would not form the front and are likely to settle quickly towards the mid - plane .",
    "al and ca could end up in a large grain size and experience radial drifting .",
    "this could potentially explain the chemical diversity observed among the bulk silicate earth , ordinary chondrites , and carbonatious chondrites .",

    "the chemical potential of gas is given by @xmath80 for gas , where @xmath81 is the chemical potential at a pressure of 1  atm and temperature @xmath4 , and @xmath38 is the total number of moles of gaseous species .",
    "equilibrium state is acquired by minimizing the gibbs free energy under the constraint of mass balance equation : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of elements in the system , @xmath84 is the number of atoms of element @xmath85 in @xmath79-th species , and @xmath86 is the number of moles of element @xmath85 in the system .",
    "equation  ( [ mass_b1 ] ) could be written in a matrix form : @xmath87 . in the system consisted of h ,",
    "o , mg , and al , for example , the corresponding row of al@xmath74o@xmath72 in @xmath88 will be @xmath89 .",
    "we use a non - linear conjugate gradient method to minimize equation  ( [ n - gibbs ] ) .",
    "we start with an initial composition of  @xmath90 and incrementally update the composition along the direction calculated from the gradient at each iteration .",
    "the gradient of the free energy function , @xmath91 , is given by @xmath81 for a solid species , and by @xmath92 for a gas species .",
    "this gradient , however , does not satisfy the mass balance relationship , so we project the gradient to the null - space of @xmath93 using the projection matrix , @xmath94 , so that numbers of moles of the elements are conserved . by applying @xmath93 ,",
    "mass conservation can be shown to hold : @xmath95 .",
    "the updated composition @xmath96 is searched as a minimum along the direction of @xmath97 : @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes an adjustable step length .",
    "the line search direction @xmath97 is calculated using the polak - ribire method",
    "@xcite : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the projected gradient , @xmath102 . for the initial search , @xmath103 is set to @xmath104 . in order to calculate the step length  @xmath99 that minimizes the free energy along the search direction  @xmath97 ,",
    "the bisection method is adopted , by using the fact that the dot product of @xmath97 and @xmath105 is zero at the minimum .",
    "other search methods that directly compare the free energy are less reliable , because subtle changes in free energy caused by metal elements can be so small compared with the free energy of hydrogen that their effect can not be represented by limited numerical precision .",
    "another constraint on minimizing the free energy is that the number of moles of every species should be non - negative .",
    "if the result of the line search returns a negative amount for a certain species , the step length  @xmath99 is adjusted to satisfy the non - negative condition for all species . at a certain iteration ,",
    "a number of moles @xmath77 could be zero for some @xmath79 , but the @xmath79-th component of the search direction @xmath97 could be negative , prohibiting further optimization . in this case",
    ", we remove the @xmath79-th species from our calculation for this step and re - optimize the number of moles .",
    "we shall , however , return @xmath79-th species into our calculation in the next iteration , because there is no guarantee that @xmath77 is zero at the global minimum .",
    "similarly , when the amounts of several species are zero and their search directions are pointing towards negative , we should not remove all the species from the calculation at once .",
    "even if the @xmath79-th component of the original projected gradient is positive , the sign of the component may change by excluding some species .",
    "we should thus check whether each component of the projected gradient is positive or not every time we remove any of the species from our calculations .",
    "it is important to randomize the order of removing the species from the system , because whether the projected gradient is positive or negative depends on the set of species we choose to compose @xmath93 .",
    "it is possible that when we remove the species from our calculations in a certain order , the projected gradient could end up with a zero vector , but if we change the order of removing the species , we may obtain a non - zero gradient that points to a lower energy state , satisfying the non - negative molar amount constraint .",
    "gas species may show a extremely small amount at global minimum , but its derivative might show a large value due to the steep nature of the derivative of log function even close to the minmum . when the gradient is large despite of the composition being close to the global minimum",
    ", it causes extra iterations to converge , so removing gas species with infinitesimal amount from the calculation at certain iterations is a way to make the calculation converge faster .",
    "this serious of procedures is continued until the norm of the projected gradient becomes sufficiently small .",
    "a flowchart for this procedure is shown in figure  [ fig_flow ] .",
    "the validity of our code is checked against hsc chemistry ( version 8.1 ) using the solar abundance data from @xcite .",
    "for all of the temperature range considered , our code matches the result from hsc chemistry within the order of numerical error ( figure  [ fig_seq](c ) ) .",
    "the condensation sequences starting with solar abundance gas and dust - enriched gas are calculated using our method , and they are plotted in figure  [ fig_seq ] .",
    "the dust - enriched gas contains 20  times more na , mg , al , si , ca and fe relative to solar composition gas . it can be seen that the condensation temperatures of these elements are up to 100 - 200  k higher in the dust - enriched system .",
