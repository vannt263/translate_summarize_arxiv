    "tin dioxide ( sno@xmath2 ) is one of the most used and interesting materials for the development of solid state gas sensors , transparent conductors , and catalysts.@xcite many physical properties of this and other oxides are driven by defects which are mostly due to the ease with which the oxygen content can be varied . in this respect ,",
    "sno@xmath2 surfaces are even more interesting because the presence of two possible oxidation states of tin ( + 2 and + 4 ) , which are combined with the reduced atomic coordination , favors compositional changes and reconstructions .",
    "although the sno@xmath3 surface is one of the most studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally,@xcite its actual structure is still a matter of debate@xcite because of the controversial aspects concerning defects and oxygen adsorption.@xcite several reconstructions are possible depending on both the preparation conditions and the sample history .",
    "nevertheless , in a faceted sample , the lowest indices @xmath4 and @xmath1 stoichiometric surfaces seem to be the most likely , to be favored from the thermodynamic point of view.@xcite    bulk and surface oxygen vacancies are extremely important for determining the electrical conductivity of tin dioxide.@xcite moreover , they are also responsible for a very efficient luminescence activity of sno@xmath2 nanobelts .",
    "first - principles calculations have revealed that bulk oxygen vacancies and tin interstitials have a low formation energy.@xcite however , few theoretical calculations of the energy levels associated to these types of defects have been published,@xcite probably because standard functionals used in density functional theory ( dft ) fail in giving the correct energy gaps.@xcite in this paper , we report on a first - principles study of the electronic and structural properties of sno@xmath2 in the presence of oxygen vacancies both in the bulk crystal and at surface and subsurface sites , focusing on the effects on the energy levels close to the fermi energy .",

    "we have verified that this approach works well for cassiterite ( bulk rutile sno@xmath5 ) , as it will be shown below .",

    "we used an energy cutoff of 30 ry for the wave functions and 180 ry for the charge density .",
    "the need of using a higher value of the charge density cutoff is due to the fact that we need an accurate estimation of the electrostatic potentials for the calculation of the electron affinities ( see below ) .    on the basis of our experience,@xcite different computational schemes",
    "converge to comparable results when all the main parameters are carefully set . in the present case ,",
    "we checked the charge density cutoff energy and the vacuum width parameters , for the plane - wave calculations , while we carefully set the gaussian basis set by adding ghost orbitals ( see below ) for the all - electron approach . once verified that both methods give reliable results , we used them for different types of calculations .",
    "the crystal package was used to perform calculations of band structures and density of states , thus taking advantage of the accuracy of b3lyp exchange - correlation functional in the single particle energy calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum - espresso package was used to perform spatial averages [ of potential energy and charge density ( see below ) ] over surface planes , align the surface electrostatic potential with the bulk one , and , therefore , perform calculations of electron affinity variations induced by defects .",

    "instead , we used a 6x6 monkhorst mesh ( 12x12 secondary mesh ) for the band structure and density of states calculations .",

    "bridging , in - plane , and sub - bridging o atoms form a primitive structural unit along the direction perpendicular to the surface , which will be referred to in the following as a surface layer.@xcite to label these atoms , we use a number for the layer depth ( 1 is the outermost layer ) and a symbol for the position within the layer : bridging ( b ) , in - plane ( ip ) , and sub - bridging ( sb ) . in the same way , the stoichiometric sno@xmath11 surface shown in panel ( b ) of fig .

    "the stoichiometric surfaces are always favored over other kinds of reconstructions when samples are treated in oxygen - rich atmosphere.@xcite in the present paper , we are interested in analyzing how oxygen vacancies modify the properties of a stoichiometric surface . we calculate the vacancy formation energy as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are , respectively , the total energy of the slab containing the vacancy , that of an isolated spin polarized o@xmath2 molecule , and that of the stoichiometric slab .",

    "former tight binding calculations@xcite fairly reproduced the lowest bands ( located at 15 - 20 ev under the top valence band ) and the overall shape of the conduction band .",
    "yet , they fail in the calculation of the top valence band , due to a wrong estimation of the charge transfer toward the oxygen atoms .",
