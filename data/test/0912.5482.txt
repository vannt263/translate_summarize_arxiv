    "in the long theoretical preparation for the lhc , a wide spectrum of options for the new physics at the tev scale has been considered .",
    "a major role has been played by supersymmetric models .",
    "several schemes have been investigated in which supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector with no renormalizable interactions with the observable sector and is communicated to the latter by a variety of mechanisms  @xcite . below the scale @xmath4 at which supersymmetry breaking is communicated ,",
    "sfermion masses are typically described by the model - independent effective lagrangian operator @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a standard model ( sm ) singlet hidden chiral superfield whose @xmath7-term vev breaks supersymmetry , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a generic light , observable chiral superfield , for example an mssm one .",
    "such an effective , supersymmetric description holds if @xmath10 .",
    "different models are characterized by different origins for the above operator .",
    "surprisingly enough , a simple and attractive possibility has been neglected in the almost three decades of phenomenological studies of supersymmetry : the possibility that the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfermioneffective ] ) arises from the renormalizable , tree level exchange of heavy vector superfields , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "this is the communication mechanism that we call tree level gauge mediation ( tgm )  @xcite . besides its simplicity",
    "( compare for example with the cumbersome set of two loop diagrams generating the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfermioneffective ] ) in ordinary , loop gauge mediation ) , this framework is also motivated by the necessary presence of superheavy vector fields in grand unified theories ( guts ) . on the verge of the lhc era , we believe it is worth filling this lacuna and spell out the consequences of tgm , also in the light of its peculiar predictions .",
    "one may wonder how such a simple possibility could have been missed",
    ". the reason might be that well known arguments seem to prevent it .",
    "the main obstacle is represented by the supertrace formula  @xcite and its consequences . in the context of the tree level ,",
    "renormalizable spontaneously broken supersymmetric theory underlying fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , we must have @xmath11 for the supertrace of the squared masses of the fields in the model . eq .",
    "( [ eq : str ] ) holds separately for each set of conserved quantum numbers  @xcite . if the action of the gauge generators on the full set of chiral superfields , @xmath12 , is traceless , as in the case we are going to consider , the supertrace vanishes .",
    "this represents a potential phenomenological problem .",
    "still , tgm leads to a viable spectrum , as we will see . while the explicit construction in the next sections is all we need to get to our results , we find useful , in this introduction , to review what the potential problem is and illustrate how tree level gauge mediation solves it .",
    "we can see the potential problem at two different levels .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eq : str ] ) holds in particular when applied to all fields with the quantum numbers of the sm fermions .",
    "let us consider then the case of the mssm .",
    "in this case the fields with the quantum numbers of the sm fermions are the sm fermions themselves , @xmath13 , and their supersymmetric partners , the sfermions @xmath14 . from @xmath15 we then conclude that the sum of the squared masses of fermions and sfermions should coincide .",
    "this is in clear contradiction with the experimental bounds on the sfermion masses , giving @xmath16 .",
    "this is however far from being the end of the story , as any realistic complete theory of supersymmetry breaking is likely to involve additional fields on top of the mssm ones .",
    "this is the case of our tgm framework , where the positive contribution to the supertrace from the mssm fermions and sfermions is compensated by an opposite contribution from extra fields with quantum numbers within the ones of the sm fermions , @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 , in agreement with the supertrace formula .",
    "the extra chiral superfields will get heavy supersymmetric mass terms .",
    "their negative contribution to the supertrace is due to the fact that their scalar components get negative @xmath19 soft masses , which however represent only negligible corrections to their much larger , positive supersymmetric mass term .",
    "as we will see , this can be obtained without ad hoc model building efforts .",
    "the supertrace formula has stronger implications than the ones outlined above , which should also be addressed .",
    "let us consider the fields with the @xmath20 quantum numbers of the @xmath21 quarks only .",
    "the latter set will contain at least the three down - type sm quarks and their scalar partners and possibly the extra fields we need to compensate the supertrace formula .",
    "let us project the supertrace formula in the flavor space of down - type fields along the direction corresponding to the lightest @xmath21-quark mass eigenstate , the down quark . note that when restricted to a given set of quantum numbers , the trace on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : str ] ) can be non - vanishing .",
    "assume now that the only u(1 ) factor in the gauge group is the sm hypercharge , @xmath22 .",
    "we then obtain  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lightest @xmath21-sfermion mass eigenstate , @xmath25 is the down quark mass , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the hypercharge gauge coupling and @xmath28 the hypercharge @xmath29-term .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) represents a serious phenomenological problem , even in the presence of the extra fields invoked above .",
    "if @xmath30 , in fact , eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) would force a down sfermion mass to be smaller than about @xmath31 , in contrast with the lowest experimental limits of a few hundreds gev .",
    "if @xmath32 , the constraint would be even stronger . if @xmath33 , the constraint would be loosened , but one could repeat the argument for the up quarks and squarks . for which the @xmath28 contribution to the relation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) would have opposite sign , leading to an even stronger bound for the lightest up squark . in order to bypass this problem , an extra u(1 ) factor , giving the same sign on both down and up fields ,",
    "is needed .",
    "such an extra u(1 ) factor is present `` by definition '' in the tgm scheme . it is the u(1 ) factor associated to the heavy vector exchange in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ( as @xmath6 is a sm singlet , the heavy vector must also be a sm singlet ) .",
    "we therefore have all the ingredients needed to overcome the potential problem set by the supertrace formula .",
    "as we will see , those ingredients naturally combine in phenomenologically viable schemes .",
    "another potential problem is represented by the fact that gaugino masses arise at the loop level and are therefore potentially suppressed with respect to the sfermion masses by a large loop factor , thus pushing the sfermions out of the reach of the lhc and introducing a significant fine - tuning in the determination of the higgs mass .",
    "we will list in section  [ sec : gauchi ] a number of gaugino mass enhancement factors that can compensate fully or partially that loop factor .",
    "a minimal model of tree - level gauge mediation has been presented in  @xcite , solving the supersymmetric flavor problem and predicting the ratio of different sfermion masses to be different from msugra and other schemes . in this paper",
    "we would like to take a broader point of view and study the general implementation of tgm .",
    "this will allow to establish the general properties of tgm , to set up the guidelines for model building and to identify what are the hypotheses under which the peculiar predictions on soft masses of the minimal model hold .",
    "moreover , we would like to present a few new approaches to the @xmath3-problem , both in the context of well known ( giudice - masiero , nmssm ) and new solutions .",
    "in particular , in section  [ sec : tree ] we will discuss what are the conditions under which heavy vector superfields can act as tree - level messengers of supersymmetry breaking and obtain a general expression for the tree level contribution to the supersymmetry breaking lagrangian , in particular to the sfermion soft masses . in section  [ sec : oneloop ]",
    ", we will consider the one - loop contributions to soft masses , concentrating mostly on gaugino masses and the enhancement factors compensating their loop suppression . in section  [ sec : guidelines ]",
    "we consider the possibility to obtain a phenomenologically viable model from the general formalism previously introduced .",
    "we will see that clear model building guidelines emerge , leading to peculiar predictions for the pattern of mssm sfermion masses and we will identify the assumptions underlying such predictions . in section  [ sec : mu ] , we will discuss a few new approaches to the @xmath3-problem , before summarizing in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the paper also contains two appendixes . in appendix a , we outline the procedure to integrate out vector superfields and address a few minor issues , such as the generalization to the non - abelian case and the role of gauge invariance in a consistent supersymmetric generalization of the expansion in the number of derivatives . in appendix b ,",
    "we provide an example of a superpotential achieving supersymmetry breaking , so(10 ) breaking to the sm , ensuring that only the mssm fields survive at lower energy ( in particular providing doublet - triplet splitting ) and solving the @xmath3-problem .",
    "such a superpotential is not aimed at being simple or realistic , but it represents a useful existence proof .",
    "in this section we discuss the conditions under which heavy vector superfields can act as tree - level messengers of supersymmetry breaking in the context of a generic , renormalizable , @xmath34 globally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions . then we recover the general expression for the tree level contribution to the sfermion soft masses .",
    "we discuss their origin both in the context of the full , renormalizable theory , and in an effective theory approach .",
    "we start from a lagrangian described by a canonical khler @xmath35 and gauge kinetic function and by a generic superpotential @xmath36 function of the chiral superfields @xmath37 , with no fayet - iliopoulos term .",
    "we follow the conventions in  @xcite .",

    "the gauge group @xmath46 ( assumed for simplicity to be simple with a single gauge coupling @xmath47 ) is broken by the scalar component vev @xmath48 to the subgroup @xmath49 at a scale @xmath50 , at which the theory is approximately supersymmetric . in the phenomenological applications we have in mind",

    "the heavy vector superfields acquire a squared mass matrix given by @xmath58 we choose the basis of heavy generators @xmath59 in such a way that the above mass matrix is diagonal , @xmath60 the heavy vector superfields become massive by eating up a corresponding number of goldstone chiral superfields .",

    "the gauge invariance condition then gives @xmath308 , i.e.  a vev for both the @xmath7-term and scalar components is not allowed .",
    "since the @xmath7-term and scalar components belong to different irreducible representations , no vector contribution to gaugino masses is generated by the 16 s .",
    "a vector contribution can still be generated by the @xmath7-term vev of a 45 , for example , for which the gauge invariance condition does now prevent a vev in both the scalar and @xmath7-term component . or , it can be generated by the @xmath7-terms of the 16 s if some of the @xmath254 also breaks supersymmetry and cancels the contribution of the 16 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaugeinv ] ) .",
    "let us next consider the chiral contribution to gaugino masses .",
    "the massive components @xmath243 and @xmath263 of the matter superfields will act as chiral messengers if they are coupled to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "let us then consider as before the case in which the @xmath254 s do not break supersymmetry , supersymmetry breaking is provided by the @xmath7-term vev @xmath7 of the singlet component of the @xmath309 and is felt by the chiral messengers through the @xmath310 interaction .",

    "their ratio is particularly interesting , as the gaugino mass @xmath175 is at present bounded to be heavier than about @xmath316 , while @xmath317 enters the radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath318 should not be too large in order not to increase the fine - tuning and not to push the stops and the other sfermions out of the lhc reach . from the previous equations we find @xmath319",

    "finally @xmath326 represents a combination of couplings that can further enhance ( or suppress , in this case ) gaugino masses .",
    "all in all , we see that the loop factor separating @xmath317 and @xmath175 is partially compensated by a combination of numerical factors : @xmath327 ( leading to @xmath328 for @xmath329 ) becomes at least @xmath330 ( leading to @xmath331 for @xmath329 ) . a largish value of the factors @xmath325 or @xmath326",

    ", we will neglect such a term .",
    "let us note , however , that such a term should arise at some level in order to make the @xmath339 s components heavy .",
    "note that the @xmath340 s do not affect gauge coupling unification at one loop and can therefore be considerably lighter than the gut scale , consistently with the required smallness of @xmath267 .",
    "the soft masses for the light sfermions are now @xmath341    unfortunately , the embedding we are discussing can not be implemented with renormalizable interactions and @xmath342 representations only .",

    "we expect at least the top yukawa coupling to arise at the renormalizable level . as in the present case @xmath343 , the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l1 ] ) can arise at the renormalizable level from a so(10 ) invariant operator only if @xmath281 has a component in a so(10 ) representation coupling to @xmath344 . and",
    "the lowest dimensional possibility containing the 5 of su(5 ) is the 210 .",
    "for this reason , we do not pursue this possibility further here , although models with large representations are not a priori excluded .",
    "we close this section with a few considerations about the possibility to identify the unified group with @xmath52 .",
    "such a possibility looks particularly appealing in the light of what above .",
    "we have seen in fact that the most straightforward possibility to realize tree level gauge mediation in so(10 ) requires the matter superfield content to include three @xmath345 , @xmath212 .",

    "all yukawas can then in principle follow from the single @xmath52 interaction @xmath349 we postpone the analysis of this promising possibility to further study .",
    "in this section , we discuss a few approaches to the @xmath3-problem in the context of tree level gauge mediation .",
    "let us remind what the @xmath3-problem is .",
    "any supersymmetric extension of the sm must contain two higgs doublet chiral superfields @xmath350 , @xmath351 , with hypercharges @xmath352 , within the light spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the lagrangian must contain a mass term for their higgsino ( fermion ) components , @xmath353 .",
    "it should also contain a corresponding term for the scalar components , @xmath354 , where @xmath207 is a dimension two parameter . the higgsino mass @xmath3 is constrained to be in the window @xmath355 by the present bounds on chargino masses and by naturalness considerations .",
    "this coincides with the window for the supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector , @xmath356 .",
    "it is then tempting try to establish a connection between these two a priori independent scales , in such a way that @xmath357 when @xmath358 , thus making the coincidence of the two scales not accidental .",
    "this is the @xmath3-problem . in the absence of such a connection",
    ", there would be no reason why @xmath3 should not be of the order of a much larger , supersymmetry conserving scale such as the gut or the planck scale . or , if a symmetry or some other independent principle suppressed @xmath3 , there would be no reason why @xmath3 should not be much smaller .",
    "fermion mass terms such as @xmath353 belong to the list of possible soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms  @xcite .",
    "the reason why they are usually omitted from the mssm effective soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian is that they can be always reabsorbed in the superpotential ( through appropriate additions to the scalar soft lagrangian ) .",
    "moreover , most models of supersymmetry breaking , including the ones we are considering , do not generate such supersymmetry breaking fermion mass terms .",
    "we can then assume that the higgsino mass term arises from a corresponding term in the superpotential .",
    "the problem is then to relate the coefficient of that ( supersymmetric ) superpotential term , @xmath359 , to the supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector , which in our case is given by @xmath360 .",
    "we discuss in the following three possible connections .",
    "one is peculiar of tree level gauge mediation , the other two have been considered in other contexts , but have specific implementations in tree level gauge mediation .",
    "we classify them according to the dimension @xmath29 of the so(10 ) operator from which the @xmath3 term arises .",
    "note that we are not addressing the origin of the smallness of @xmath182 and @xmath3 compared to the plank scale , just their connection .",
    "the three options we consider are :    @xmath361 : : :    @xmath3 comes from the operator    @xmath362 .",
    "it is the    supersymmetry breaking scale to be derived from @xmath3 , and    not viceversa : @xmath363 , where    @xmath364 , and    @xmath365 . @xmath366",
    ": : :    @xmath3 comes from the operator    @xmath367 . the light sm    singlet @xmath368 gets a vev from a potential whose only scale    is @xmath182 , so that    @xmath369 .",
    "@xmath370 : : :    @xmath3 comes from the operator    @xmath371 , so that    @xmath372 .",
    "let us discuss each of those possibilities in turn .",
    "such a possibility was anticipated in  @xcite , where however no concrete implementation was given .",
    "let us consider the @xmath257 embedding . as discussed in section  [ sec:1610 ]",
    ", @xmath350 is a superposition of the `` up higgs - type '' components in the @xmath254 s and @xmath236 s ( with @xmath374 ) in the model .",
    "analogously , @xmath351 will be a superposition of the `` down higgs - type '' components in the ( @xmath375 ) @xmath376 s and @xmath236 s .",
    "the only possible @xmath373 origin of the @xmath3-term in the context of the full so(10 ) theory are then @xmath19 mass terms for the above @xmath254 s , @xmath377 s , and @xmath236 s .",
    "as said , we do not address the origin of such a small parameter in the superpotential , as we do not address here the smallness of the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the latter can for example be explained by a dynamical mechanism .",
    "we want however to relate such mass parameters , in particular the coefficient of a @xmath378 mass term , to the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "this is actually pretty easy , as the tree level gauge mediation embedding we are considering provides all the necessary ingredients and the result arises from their simple combination .",
    "we have seen in fact that the model needs a @xmath377 , @xmath254 pair to get a vev in the sm singlet direction of the scalar component , in order to break so(10 ) to the sm .",
    "moreover , we have seen that an independent @xmath309 , @xmath379 pair is required to break supersymmetry trough the @xmath7-term vev of the sm singlet component in the @xmath309 . the simplest way to achieve such a pattern is through a superpotential like @xmath380 where @xmath222 , @xmath6 are so(10 ) singlets and @xmath381 .",
    "this is a generalization of an example in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have just reminded that the light higgses may have a component in @xmath377 , @xmath309 , @xmath254 , @xmath379 .",
    "let @xmath382 be the coefficient of the @xmath296 component in the @xmath309 and @xmath383 the coefficient of the @xmath295 component in the @xmath254 .",

    ", supersymmetry is unbroken and @xmath377 , @xmath254 acquire a vev that can be rotated in the sm singlet component @xmath389 . a non - vanishing @xmath3 , on the other hand , triggers supersymmetry breaking and induces an @xmath7-term vev for the singlet component of the @xmath309 , @xmath390 , with @xmath391 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath392 providing the desired connection between @xmath3 and the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "tree level gauge mediation plays a crucial role not only in providing the ingredients ( and no need to stir ) but also because it is the very so(10 ) structure providing the heavy vector messengers to relate in a single irreducible representation ( the 16 ) supersymmetry breaking ( the @xmath7-term vev of its sm singlet component ) and the down higgs entering the @xmath3-term ( the lepton doublet - type component of the 16 ) .",
    "in the appendix  [ sec : w ] we provide an existence proof of a ( perturbative ) superpotential that i ) implements the mechanism above , thus breaking supersymmetry and so(10 ) to su(5 ) , ii ) further breaks su(5 ) to the sm , iii ) makes all the fields that are not part of the mssm spectrum heavy , in particular achieves doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "this is an implementation of the nmssm solution of the @xmath3-problem  ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",

    ", the scale of a vev for @xmath368 can only be provided by the supersymmetry breaking terms in the soft lagrangian , @xmath396 , in which case @xmath397 , as desired .    in order to generate a non - zero vev for @xmath368 , one would like to have a negative soft mass for @xmath368 at the weak scale , along with a stabilization mechanism for large values of the fields . in ordinary gauge mediation",
    "this is not easy to achieve . while the stabilization can be simply provided by a @xmath398 term in @xmath150 , as in the nmssm ( or by a quartic term in @xmath399 extensions of the mssm  @xcite ) , the soft mass term of @xmath368 vanishes at the messenger scale because @xmath368 is typically a complete gauge singlet .",
    "a non - vanishing negative mass term is generated by the rge running but it is typically too small .",
    "another problem is that the higgs spectrum can turn out to be non - viable  @xcite .",
    "a sizable soft mass can still be generated by coupling @xmath368 to additional heavy fields .",
    "such possibilities can be implemented in our setup by promoting @xmath368 to an so(10 ) singlet and coupling it to the higgses through a @xmath400 or a @xmath401 coupling to the so(10 ) representations containing ( a component of ) the higgs fields .",
    "tree level gauge mediation offers a different avenue .",
    "a sizable , negative soft mass term for @xmath368 can in fact be generated by embedding @xmath368 in a @xmath254 of so(10 ) ( this is the only choice within the fields in table  [ tab : x ] ) .",

    "a sizable @xmath398 term is not expected to arise , as it should involve a so(10 ) operator with three @xmath254 .",
    "however , the @xmath398 term can be replaced by a term involving a second light singlet @xmath213 , @xmath402 the latter can come from a @xmath403 coupling , if @xmath213 is in the 126 singlet , or from a @xmath404 coupling , where @xmath213 is the @xmath405 singlet and @xmath406 gets a vev .",

    "we have neglected the @xmath124-terms , which play a role in explicitly breaking @xmath413-symmetries that could lead to massless states .",
    "the potential above has a minimum with a sizable @xmath414 , and a @xmath3 parameter whose size is controlled by @xmath326 .",
    "finally , let us consider the possibility to generate the @xmath3 parameter through a @xmath370 correction to the khler in the form @xmath415 , as in the giudice masiero mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-term vev @xmath416 of @xmath6 would give in this case @xmath417 .",
    "we show first that the operator above can not arise at the tree level from integrating out heavy vector or chiral superfields .",
    "the corrections to the khler obtained by integrating out heavy vector superfields are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : keff2 ] ) .",
    "all terms are at least of second order in @xmath418 and no trilinear term is present .",
    "moreover , no sizable trilinear term can be obtained through the vev of @xmath66 , as by definition the scalar components of @xmath66 do not get a vev ( and an @xmath7-term vev would give an additional @xmath419 suppression ) . a similar conclusion can be obtained for the corrections one obtains by integrating out chiral superfields @xmath119 with mass @xmath420 .",
    "we have seen in section  [ sec : tree ] that the equations of motion allow to express @xmath119 in terms of the light fields as in eq .",

    "( [ eq : phih ] ) in the canonical khler for @xmath119 one gets again terms that contain at least four light fields , with none of them getting a vev in the scalar component .",
    "therefore , no operator @xmath421 can be generated at the tree level by integrating out heavy fields .",
    "let us now consider the possibility that the @xmath370 operator above is obtained at the one loop level .",
    "this possibility raises two issues .",
    "first , @xmath3 would be suppressed compared to , say , the stop mass @xmath317 by a loop factor @xmath422 . as for the case of gaugino masses vs sfermion masses , such a large hierarchy would lead to sfermions beyond the reach of the lhc and a significant fine - tuning .",
    "however , as we will see , this problem can be overcome in the same way as for the gaugino masses .",
    "we will see in fact in an explicit model that @xmath3 and @xmath423 get a similar enhancement factor .",
    "the second issue is the well known @xmath3-@xmath207 problem .",
    "@xmath207 is a dimension two parameter generated , as @xmath3 , at the one loop level .",
    "therefore , we expect an order of magnitude separation between @xmath424 and @xmath3 : @xmath425 .",

    "we therefore need to cancel the contribution to @xmath207 we get at one loop with an additional contribution , at least in the specific example we consider .",
    "such a cancellation may not be required in different implementations of the one - loop @xmath370 origin of the @xmath3 parameter .",

    "such a pq symmetry can however be broken by adding a term @xmath449 to the above superpotential , coming for example from the non - renormalizable so(10 ) operator @xmath450 after @xmath254 gets its vev ( note that @xmath451 would give @xmath452 ) .",

    "the rge evolution of @xmath207 from the scale at which it is generated ( @xmath469 ) down to the electroweak scale can reduce the value of @xmath207 but not enough to make it as small as we need . a significant rge contribution",
    "would in fact require @xmath470 , in contrast with the @xmath471 we are trying to reproduce .",
    "we are then forced to invoke a cancellation between the one - loop contribution to @xmath207 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muchi]b ) and an additional contribution . for example , a tree level contribution to @xmath207 can be obtained as in appendix b or in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered what may be regarded as one of the simplest ways to communicate supersymmetry breaking from a hidden to the observable sector , through the tree level , renormalizable exchange of superheavy gauge ( gut ) messengers , and we have studied the general properties of such a tree level gauge mediation ( tgm ) scheme .",
    "we have first of all obtained the general structure of the tree - level soft terms arising from a supersymmetry breaking source that is part of a non - trivial gauge ( gut ) multiplet .",
    "this is most conveniently done in the effective theory in which the heavy vector superfields associated to the broken generators are integrated out at the tree level ( en passant , in appendix a , we summarized the procedure to integrate out vector superfields and addressed a few minor issues , such as the generalization to the non - abelian case and the role of gauge invariance in a consistent supersymmetric generalization of the expansion in the number of derivatives ) .",

    "this potential phenomenological problem , which has long been considered as an obstacle to tree level supersymmetry breaking , is automatically solved in the models we consider because the fields getting a @xmath19 negative soft mass also get an @xmath472 positive , supersymmetric mass .",
    "gaugino masses do not arise at the tree level , but can be generated at the one - loop level , as in ordinary gauge mediation .",

    "we listed four potential enhancement factors that can ( do ) compensate , at least partially , the loop suppression : a larger number of ( chiral ) messengers contributing to gaugino masses than ( vector ) messengers contributing to sfermion masses ; group theoretical factors that in practice turn out to enhance gaugino masses ; the fact that sfermion masses are suppressed by all the vevs with non - vanishing gauge coupling to the vector messengers , while gaugino masses are suppressed only by the vevs that are related to supersymmetry breaking through superpotential interactions ; ratios of yukawa couplings appearing in the expression for the gaugino masses . in minimal models",
    "the first two factors partially compensate the @xmath422 loop factor , reducing it to the level of a tolerable ( and possibly necessary ) one order of magnitude hierarchy between gauginos and sfermions .",
    "the last two factors are more model - dependent but can give rise to larger enhancements .",
    "the general analysis of the tgm scheme allowed us to define the guidelines to obtain phenomenologically viable models from the general formalism and to identify the assumptions underlying the peculiar predictions one obtains .",
    "clear model building guidelines emerge , identifying so(10 ) and @xmath52 as the `` minimal '' grand - unified groups , while su(5 ) is found not to have the necessary structure ( rank @xmath473 ) to realize the tgm scheme .",

    "it turns out in fact that the so(10 ) breaking vevs of a @xmath255 , important to break so(10 ) to the sm , typically make heavy precisely the components of the so(10 ) representations that need to be made heavy because of their negative soft supersymmetry breaking masses .",
    "this reinforces the logical consistency of the tgm framework .    in so(10 ) , the tree level sfermion soft masses turn out to be proportional to their charges under the su(5)-invariant so(10 ) generator @xmath222 .",

    "the mssm fields in 10 s of su(5 ) are embedded in the @xmath334 s , while the ones unified in @xmath235 s of su(5 ) , are embedded in the @xmath239 s . as before , they all get positive soft masses . in both cases the chiral content of the theory is still given by three 16 of so(10 ) .",
    "an important property of the tgm soft terms is that they turn out to be family universal , thus solving the supersymmetric flavor problem .",
    "this property only depends on the hypothesis that the three mssm families are embedded in the same so(10 ) representations .",
    "mixed embeddings , in which the mssm fields are superpositions of fields in inequivalent so(10 ) representations , are also possible , but can spoil the flavor universality property .",
    "each of the two possible flavor - universal embeddings leads to specific and peculiar predictions for the soft masses at the gut scale : @xmath1 in the @xmath234 case and @xmath2 in the @xmath245 case , where @xmath477 and @xmath478 are common and family - independent soft masses for the fields in the @xmath235 and @xmath236 of su(5 ) respectively .",
    "the latter predictions are only based on i ) the use of the `` minimal '' unified gauge group so(10 ) , ii ) the embedding of the mssm families in the so(10 ) representations with dimension @xmath221 not containing the goldstino , and iii ) the absence of mixed embeddings to automatically preserve flavor - universality .",
    "the predictions on the ratios @xmath253 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prediction ] ) are determined by group theory factors and are peculiar enough to make a possible experimental test at the lhc a strong hint for tree level gauge mediation .",
    "the embedding into three @xmath257 s has the advantage that the large top yukawa coupling can be accounted for by a renormalizable superpotential interaction involving only low - dimensional ( @xmath479 ) representations for the chiral superfields . in the @xmath258 case , a @xmath480 representation of so(10 )",
    "must be used to reproduce the top yukawa coupling at the renormalizable level .",
    "the @xmath52 option is also quite appealing , as the matter superfield content of the @xmath257 embedding is precisely the one obtained from three fundamentals @xmath347 of @xmath52 .",

    "the @xmath373 option provides a new approach to the @xmath3-problem , peculiar of tgm .",
    "the idea is that the supersymmetry breaking scale turns out to coincide with the @xmath3 scale because supersymmetry is triggered by the same @xmath373 so(10 ) operator from which the @xmath3-term arises .",
    "we have provided an explicit realization of such a possibility in appendix b. the superpotential shown there also achieves supersymmetry breaking , so(10 ) breaking to the sm , and ensures that only the mssm fields survive below the breaking scale ( in particular it provides doublet - triplet splitting ) .",

    "the @xmath370 option is nothing but the giudice - masiero mechanism realized at the loop level , as in gauge mediation .",
    "the consequent loop hierarchy between the @xmath3-term and the sfermion masses can be reduced exactly as for the gaugino masses .",

    "<S> tree level gauge mediation ( tgm ) may be considered as the simplest way to communicate supersymmetry breaking : through the tree level renormalizable exchange of heavy gauge messengers . </S>",
    "<S> we study its general structure , in particular the general form of tree level sfermion masses and of one loop , but enhanced , gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to set up general guidelines for model building and to identify the hypotheses underlying the phenomenological predictions . in the context of models based on the `` minimal '' gauge group so(10 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we show that only two `` pure '' embeddings of the mssm fields are possible using @xmath0 representations , each of them leading to specific predictions for the ratios of family universal sfermion masses at the gut scale , @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( in su(5 ) notation ) . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are determined by group factors and are peculiar enough to make this scheme testable at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss three possible approaches to the @xmath3-problem , one of them distinctive of tgm . </S>"
