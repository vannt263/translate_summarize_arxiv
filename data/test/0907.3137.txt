    "the analysis of neural signals seeks to `` translate '' any set of neural impulses into a language we understand @xcite .",
    "but as the neural signals elicited by the same stimulus are never exactly alike , we need a quantitative means of determining when two neural signals serve the same purpose . in",
    "what follows , we shall restrict our attention to signals from isolated cell electrophysiology , and represent a `` spike train '' neural signal as a marked point process , an ordered list of spike times labeled by their respective neurons of origin @xcite . to compare spike trains , victor and purpura introduced the notion of a _ spike metric _ , a distance function on the set of spike trains endowing it with the topological properties of a metric space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "spike metrics have been successfully used to quantify variability in data and characterize neural coding in the visual , auditory , olfactory , taste , and electric sensory systems @xcite .",
    "numerous spike metrics have been proposed with the goals of clustering neural signals by stimulus @xcite , @xcite and embedding them in euclidean space @xcite via multidimensional scaling ( mds ) @xcite .",
    "mds allows one to visualize the geometry of spike data , especially after the use of sophisticated dimensionality - reduction procedures such as local linear embedding @xcite .",
    "it also permits us to use more sophisticated clustering techniques designed to work only in vector spaces , such as pca - guided k - means @xcite and soft - margin support vector machines , as done ( without embedding ) in @xcite .",
    "one approach to spike metric design for spike trains generated by single neurons uses the rate - coding hypothesis of spike generation , the idea that spike trains induced by the same stimulus are instances of the same variable - rate poisson process @xcite .",
    "the implication is that to compare two spike trains , one must compare their estimated underlying rate functions . to estimate the rate function of a spike train ,",
    "represent it as a sum of kronecker delta functions at the spike times and stream it through a low - pass filter , or , equivalently , convolve it with a nonnegative function , or _ kernel _ , that integrates to @xmath4 .",
    "common choices of kernels include the one - sided exponential tail @xcite , the two sided exponential tail , the ` tent ' function ( @xmath5 above and below a certain range , and linearly increasing and then decreasing at the same rate within that range ) , and the normal distribution function @xcite . the value of the metric between two spike trains is the @xmath0 norm of the difference between their estimated rate functions ( @xmath6 ) . for @xmath7 ,",
    "such metrics resemble euclidean distances , and mds can embed them in ( mostly ) euclidean finite dimensional vector spaces",
    ".    however , their is substantial evidence that the time - coding of neural signals contains meaning beyond that conveyed by the firing rate @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "based on this fact , victor and purpura introduced a spike metric equal to the minimum ` cost ' of aligning the spikes in two spike trains , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their approach was to generalize methods used for comparing strands of dna .",
    "in particular , they reengineered sellers dynamic programming algorithm for aligning and calculating the evolutionary distance between pairs of dna sequences @xcite to compute a distance between pairs of spike trains @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this metric preserves the integrity of individual spikes instead of viewing them as contributions to a rate function .",
    "it has the added advantage of being able to compute distances between spike trains that may have contributions from multiple neurons , and in the future , it may be generalized to align spikes from multiple spike trains at once , as has been done with dna @xcite .",
    "the problem with it is that it resembles an @xmath8 norm on a vector space .",
    "if one uses it to compute all the distances among a group of spike trains elicited from a common stimulus , and then embeds those spike trains using those distances by mds , the resulting picture is very complicated .",
    "the embedded set of spike trains may have hyperbolic structure that is not present in the stimulus space .",
    "we propose a spike metric consistent with the time - coding hypothesis of spike generation that has all of the desirable properties of an @xmath0 norm .",
    "when @xmath9 , this metric is equal to the victor - purpura metric @xcite , @xcite . when @xmath7 , embeddings of spike trains using this metric ` fit ' in euclidean space with substantially less difficulty than they do for any other value of @xmath6 , so advanced dimensionality - reduction and clustering techniques may be used .",
    "the dynamic programming algorithm described by victor and purpura does not work when @xmath10 , so we propose a faster quadratic - time algorithm that works for all @xmath6 .",
    "this procedure we use to calculate our metric is the hungarian algorithm @xcite , which can be made substantially faster for the specific task of comparing spike trains .",
    "the crucial insight behind the hungarian algorithm was independently discovered by kuhn and munkres @xcite , @xcite .",
    "its function is to solve the minimum - weight matching problem on weighted bipartite graphs .",
    "the hungarian algorithm is a special case of algorithms to solve general matching problems @xcite and assignment problems @xcite .",
    "our version of the algorithm it is a special case of algorithms to solve transportation problems on monge arrays , described in @xcite .",
    "the original transportation problem was solved by hoffman @xcite and formulated by monge @xcite .",
    "we desire to match spikes in one spike train to corresponding spikes in another spike train to compare the two signals .",
    "two trains fired in response to the same stimulus may have different numbers of spikes .",
    "so , an alignment of the spikes in the two trains will be inherently imperfect , some spikes may have to be deleted from the trains to make the alignment exact .",
    "victor and purpura s idea was to break the process of aligning two spike trains into steps , each with their own cost .",
    "the metric is equal to the sum of the costs incurred by the most efficient alignment @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 .",
    "the cost of aligning two spikes on different trains is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the distance between them .",
    "the cost of deleting a spike on either train is @xmath4 .",

    "our generalization is as follows : let @xmath6 , the metric is @xmath19^{1/p}.\\ ] ] when @xmath9 this is the standard victor - purpura metric .",
    "+ we can formulate the metric in a way that is more mathematically specific as follows : let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be spike trains , or strictly increasing finite sequences of real numbers .",

    "our metric is a minimization over all possible matchings .",
    "we can map this minimization to a classical problem , _ weighted bipartite matching _ . in this problem",
    "we have a graph whose nodes belong to two different classes with no edge connecting members of the same class ( bipartite ) and each edge of the graph has a `` weight '' or cost . a matching or pairing",
    "is a subgraph in which each node has at most one connection , and the matching with the smallest total cost is sought .    a priori , the number of distinct matchings is enormous .",
    "there is a profound result , called the hungarian algorithm @xcite , that shows that only a small subset of these matchings needs to be examined .",
    "this result works by showing that the optimal match with precisely @xmath32 pairings ( cardinality @xmath32 ) is related in a rather specific way to the optimal match of cardinality @xmath33 : the optimal @xmath32 match differs from the optimal @xmath33 match by an `` @xmath22-augmenting path '' .",
    "since there are many fewer such paths than matchings of cardinality @xmath32 the search is considerably faster .",
    "we shall show that the convexity of our metric translates into a specific property of the graph weights called the monge property @xcite . using the monge property we can discard large fractions of the @xmath22-augmenting paths as candidates : the paths have to be `` monotonic '' and can not `` jump '' .",
    "we call the resulting , much smaller set of `` @xmath22-augmenting incompressible monotonic paths '' the _ shifts_. there are far fewer shifts to explore in connecting level @xmath33 with level @xmath32 , at most @xmath34 .",
    "for certain matchings @xmath22 we can construct a unique two - row matrix representation , or ` matching matrix ' as follows : the first row contains the elements of @xmath24 in increasing order ( from left to right ) , and the second row contains the elements of @xmath25 in increasing order . if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 and @xmath37 are in the same column of the matrix . if @xmath36 is not matched in @xmath22 , then it is in the same column as a ` @xmath38 ' symbol .",

    "so let @xmath173 and assume that there exists and integer @xmath174 such that @xmath175 ( we can likewise assume that there exists an integer between @xmath176 and @xmath177 , this case is similar ) .",
    "now there are two cases : either @xmath178 is connected to an edge in @xmath22 or it is not .",
    "if it is connected to an edge , call that edge @xmath179 .",
    "@xmath180 , otherwise the fact that @xmath179 and @xmath166 are both in @xmath22 contradicts lemma 3 .",
    "but in that case , since @xmath181 , @xmath179 and @xmath168 are both in @xmath92 , which by theorem 1 is a minimum weight matching of cardinality @xmath32 , contradicting lemma 3 .",
    "+ now consider the case when @xmath178 is not connected to an edge .",
    "replace the edge @xmath168 with @xmath182 in @xmath73 to form @xmath183 .",
    "@xmath183 may not be an @xmath22-augmenting path , but @xmath184 is still a matching of cardinality @xmath32 .",
    "we know that @xmath185 since otherwise the edge @xmath182 would be in @xmath22 instead of @xmath186",
    ". therefore , @xmath187 .",
    "if @xmath188 , this implies @xmath189 making @xmath190 , a contradiction .",
    "so @xmath191 .",
    "since @xmath192 , @xmath193 , making @xmath194 @xmath184 is a matching of cardinality @xmath32 of lower weight than that of @xmath92 , but since @xmath73 is of maximum length , theorem 1 implies that @xmath92 has minimum weight .",
    "this is a contradiction and the theorem follows for @xmath10 .",
    "+ finally , assume that there is an unmatched element of @xmath24 between @xmath195 and @xmath196 , call it @xmath197 , with corresponding vertex @xmath198 ( the case when there is an unmatched element of @xmath25 between @xmath199 and @xmath200 is analogous ) .",
    "since @xmath201 by the previous paragraph , @xmath202 .",
    "replace the edge @xmath110 with @xmath203 in @xmath73 to form @xmath183 .",
    "@xmath183 may be be an @xmath22-augmenting path , but as before @xmath184 is still a matching of cardinality @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath201 implies @xmath204 , and since these quantities are nonnegative , @xmath205 using theorem 1 , @xmath73 could not have been an @xmath22-augmenting path of maximum length , a contradiction .",
    "the theorem follows for @xmath206 .",
    "+ now we address the @xmath9 case . for some constants @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , the difference in length between two @xmath22-augmenting paths @xmath73 and @xmath183 is @xmath210 @xmath211 is real analytic and its taylor series @xmath212 converges everywhere .",
    "either @xmath211 is identically @xmath5 or there exist some least integral exponent @xmath63 such that the coefficient of @xmath213 in @xmath212 is nonzero .",
    "if it is positive then there exists some @xmath214 such that @xmath215 is strictly positive on @xmath216 , likewise if it is negative we can pick @xmath217 such that @xmath211 is strictly negative on @xmath216 by @xcite , theorem 1 .",
    "we can determine such an @xmath217 for every pair of @xmath22-augmenting paths @xmath73 and @xmath183 that do not have the same length for all @xmath218 .",
    "let @xmath219 be the minimum of all of these @xmath217 s . there exists a set of @xmath22-augmenting paths @xmath220 such that for @xmath221 they all have equal length and they are all longer than all other @xmath22-augmenting paths .",
    "they all must be shifts . by continuity , when @xmath9 they still have equal length and are at least as long as all other @xmath22-augmenting paths .",
    "therefore , @xmath222 is a matching of minimum weight of cardinality @xmath32 when @xmath223 .. 06 in    * definition . *",
    "let @xmath22 be a matching of minimum weight of cardinality @xmath33 and @xmath73 be an @xmath22-augmenting path .",
    "we call @xmath73 an @xmath22-shift it it corresponds to a shift in the matching matrix of @xmath22 .. 06 in    _ proof of theorem 3 . _",
    "let @xmath128 be the minimum weight matching of cardinality @xmath33 .",
    "it suffices to show that if @xmath224 , then if @xmath225 exists , @xmath226 .",
    "it follows by induction that @xmath227 has lower weight than all minimum weight matchings of cardinality greater than @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the sequence @xmath228 is decreasing then increasing , and the point at which the switch occurs is its minimum .",
    "+ all @xmath128-shifts have negative length , since the one with the greatest length , @xmath73 , has negative length , as @xmath224 ( using theorem 1 ) .",
    "therefore all @xmath133-shifts have negative length since they are also @xmath128 shifts , except for possibly one , @xmath142 , that is not .",
    "if @xmath142 does not exist or is not the @xmath133-shift of greatest length , then the shift of greatest length has negative length , and @xmath226 , so we are done .",

    "we shall prove that @xmath229 .",
    "sending @xmath128 to @xmath230 and then sending @xmath133 to @xmath231 corresponds to deleting two pairs of stars in one of four classes of matching matrices .",
    "we consider only two of them , since the others are analogous : + @xmath232\\ ] ] + @xmath233\\ ] ] + to get the other two cases , switch the top stars to the bottom and the bottom stars to the top in each of the above examples , and reindex accordingly . in both matrices",
    ", deleting the inner pair of stars corresponds to transforming @xmath128 into @xmath133 and deleting the outer pair of stars corresponds to transforming @xmath133 into @xmath225 . in the first matching matrix there are three possible @xmath128-shifts .",
    "the middle one is @xmath73 .",
    "call the rightmost one @xmath234 and the rightmost one @xmath235 .",
    "@xmath236 , and @xmath237 .",
    "@xmath238 , since performing the shift @xmath73 followed by @xmath142 is the same operation as performing the shift @xmath234 followed by @xmath235 on the matrix .",

    "now consider the second matching matrix .",
    "there are @xmath128-augmenting paths @xmath234 and @xmath235 such that changing @xmath128 to @xmath240 or @xmath241 is equivalent to deleting both the first and third stars in the matrix ( from the left ) or both the second and fourth stars from the matrix .",
