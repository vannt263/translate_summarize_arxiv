    "linear positive systems @xcite have been recently the subject of an increasing attention because of their natural ability to represent many real - world processes such as , among others , communication networks @xcite , biological networks @xcite , epidemiological networks @xcite , disease dynamics @xcite , etc . besides their applicative potential",
    ", linear positive systems have been shown to exhibit a number of interesting theoretical properties of independent interest .",
    "for instance , it is now well - known that linear copositive lyapunov functions can be used in order to formulate exact stability conditions taking the form of linear programs @xcite .",
    "the design of structured and bounded state - feedback controllers @xcite and certain classes of static output feedback controllers @xcite are known to be convex and hence easily tractable .",
    "the @xmath0-gains for @xmath1 can be exactly computed using convex programming and these gains are identical to the @xmath2-norm of the static matrix - gain of the system @xcite .",
    "the famous kalman - yakubovich - popov lemma has been shown to admit a linear formulation in this setting @xcite .",
    "robust analysis results also nicely extends and simplifies in this context , and often becomes necessary and sufficient criteria for stability @xcite .",
    "their generalization to delay - systems with discrete - delays also led to the surprise that the system is stable if and only if the system with zero delay is stable @xcite .",
    "design - wise , it has been shown in @xcite that the state - feedback controller that minimizes the @xmath3-gain of the closed - loop system is independent of the matrices driving the disturbance input to the state and the output of the system .",
    "symmetrically , it is shown in @xcite that the observer - gain that minimizes the @xmath4-gain of map between the disturbance input and the observation error is independent of the output matrices of the error system .",
    "extensions to deterministically @xcite or stochastically @xcite switched systems have also been considered .",
    "we consider here the case of linear positive impulsive systems , a class of systems that seems to have been quite overlooked until now as only very few results can be found ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such systems can be used to represent certain classes biochemical , population or epidemiological models having deterministic jumps in their dynamics .",
    "they can also be used to represent processes that can be represented as linear positive switched systems ; see e.g. @xcite for some examples including epidemiology @xcite , traffic congestion models @xcite , etc .",
    "impulsive systems are also well known to be able to exactly represent sampled - data systems as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is hence the derivation of novel stability and stabilization conditions for linear positive impulsive systems using the concepts of arbitrary , constant , minimum , maximum and range dwell - times .",
    "the concept of _ minimum dwell - time _ has been introduced by morse in @xcite in order to formulate stability conditions for general ( i.e. not necessarily positive ) switched systems .",
    "the concept of _ average dwell - time _ has been proposed in @xcite in order to obtained less conservative conditions that by using minimum dwell - time conditions . since then , a large body of the literature has been focusing on these concepts as a way to efficiently characterize the stability of switched systems or , more generally , the stability of hybrid systems ; see e.g. @xcite . the notion of minimum dwell - time has been revisited in @xcite where novel sufficient lmi conditions derived from mode - dependent quadratic lyapunov functions were proposed .",
    "based on a theoretical result proved in @xcite , these conditions were later extended and made necessary and sufficient in @xcite through the consideration of mode - dependent homogeneous lyapunov functions . unfortunately , these conditions were inapplicable to uncertain systems and to control design because of their complex nonlinear dependency in the matrices of the system .",
    "this problem motivated the introduction of the so - called _ looped - functionals _",
    ", a particular class of indefinite ( i.e. not necessarily positive definite ) functionals having the advantage of reformulating the complex conditions of @xcite into conditions being linear in the matrices of the system ; see e.g. @xcite , thereby extending the scope of the conditions to uncertain and nonlinear systems . yet",
    ", these conditions were difficult to apply in the context of control design because of the presence of multiple products between decision matrices and the matrices of the system ; see e.g. @xcite . _",
    "clock - dependent conditions _ have been shown to provide an essential framework for solving this latter problem as they produce stability conditions that are linear / convex in the matrices of the system and can be used for design purposes .",
    "their computational complexity has also been shown to be much lower than that of looped - functionals @xcite . since then",
    ", clock - dependent conditions have been used for the analysis and control of switched , impulsive , sampled - data and lpv systems ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the first part of the paper is similar to the ones in @xcite where stability conditions are formulated in terms of the decrease of a lyapunov function of a given type . unlike in the previous references where quadratic lyapunov functions are involved ,",
    "we exploit here the positivity of the system and consider a linear copositive lyapunov function @xcite .",
    "the resulting conditions are stated in terms of finite - dimensional linear programs or semi - infinite dimensional linear programs , which are then relaxed into clock - dependent conditions using a lifting approach similar to that of @xcite .",
    "since linear copositive lyapunov functions are used here , the clock - dependent conditions consist of infinite - dimensional linear programs .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the fact that when quadratic lyapunov functions are used , clock - dependent conditions take the form of infinite - dimensional semidefinite programs , which may be harder to solve that their linear counterpart .",
    "three possible ways for efficiently checking these conditions are then proposed .",
    "the first one relies on a discretization approach which is largely inspired from @xcite and where the infinite - dimensional decision variable is assumed to be continuous and piecewise linear .",
    "this method has also been considered , in turn , in @xcite . by doing so",
    ", the infinite - dimensional program becomes finite - dimensional and can be solved using conventional algorithms such as interior point methods ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the second method is based on handelman s theorem @xcite which characterizes the positivity of a given polynomial on a compact polytope by formulating it as a nonnegative linear combination of products of the ( affine ) basis functions that describe the polytope .",
    "this result has been applied in various contexts @xcite and , notably , for characterizing the robust stability of uncertain linear positive systems in @xcite .",
    "an important property of this approach is that the obtained characterization for the positivity of the polynomial can be exactly formulated as a finite - dimensional linear program , which can again be solved using well - known approaches .",
    "finally , the last one is based on putinar s positivstellensatz @xcite which characterizes the positivity of a given polynomial on a compact semialgebraic set by formulating it as a weighted linear combination of the basis functions that describe the set and where the weights are sum of squares polynomials .",
    "the resulting problem takes , in this case , the form of a finite - dimensional semidefinite program @xcite that can be solved using standard semidefinite programming solvers such as sedumi @xcite or sdpt3 @xcite used in conjunction with the package sostools @xcite .",
    "it is notably emphasized that these relaxations are asymptotically exact meaning that when the discretization order , the number of products of basis functions or the degree of the sum of squares weights are sufficiently large , then the relaxed problem is feasible if the original one is .",
    "several examples are considered in order to demonstrate the practicality of the relaxed conditions and to compare them in terms of number of variables and solving time .",
    "the results are then extended to control design by considering the clock - dependent conditions and the dual impulsive system @xcite . by finally exploiting the possibility of formulating a switched system as an impulsive system",
    ", we derive a number of stability conditions for linear positive switched systems .",
    "notably , we recover stability conditions similar to those in @xcite which are the positive counterpart of those obtained in @xcite in the context of general linear switched systems while some other ones seem to be new .",
    "novel stabilization conditions under arbitrary , minimum and mode - dependent range dwell - time conditions are then obtained and illustrated through few examples",
    ". + * outline .",
    "* the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : preliminary ] preliminary definitions and results are given .",
    "section [ sec : stab ] is devoted to the dwell - time stability analysis of linear positive impulsive systems while section [ sec : stabz ] addresses their stabilization .",
    "these results are then applied to switched systems in section [ sec : switched ] .",

    "first of all , the conditions are affine in the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the system , allowing then for an immediate extension to uncertain matrices and to control design ( the latter requiring some additional steps that will be detailed in section [ sec : stabz ] ) .",
    "a particularity of the approach is that we only need the vectors @xmath130 and @xmath131 to be positive while most of the lyapunov approaches would require the whole vector - valued functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 to be positive on their domain ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a constraint that is computationally way more complex .",
    "the explanation for that in spite of the fact that the conditions in statements and statement look like continuous - time stability conditions , they are in fact lifted discrete - time stability condition for which only the behavior of the inequalities at the extremal points of the domain of the lifting variable ( i.e. the points @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) are actually meaningful .",
    "the same discussion is made in @xcite in the context of looped - functionals and in @xcite in the context of clock - dependent conditions .",

    "this proves that the proposed method is way less conservative than the one proposed in @xcite where the value 1.0986 is found for the minimum dwell - time .",

    "this value was also found in @xcite using conditions based on quadratic lyapunov functions .",
    "this value also coincides with the minimal value obtained in the constant dwell - time case , emphasizing then the exactness of the computed minimum dwell - time .    on the other hand , when @xmath232 , the conditions of remark [ rem : swapped_minimum ] yield the value 0.4290 while the value 0.3615 is obtained using the conditions of theorem [ th : mindt2 ] , ( a ) .",

    "moreover , the discrepancy between the results obtained with the conditions in theorem [ th : mindt2 ] and in remark [ rem : swapped_minimum ] demonstrate the non - equivalence of the conditions and in the necessity of considering both in order to obtain less conservative result .",
