    "images @xcite are strikingly similar to simulations of forming brightest cluster galaxies , based on hierarchical models ( e.g. , aragn - salamanca , baugh , & kauffmann 1998 ) .",
    "a pilot project on the very large telescope ( vlt ) to search for ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies around the clumpy radio galaxy pks 1138262 , resulted in the discovery of 14 galaxies and a qso at approximately the same redshift as the radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "if the structure found is virialized , the total mass of the protocluster would be @xmath9 @xmath6 .",
    "motivated by this result , we started a large program at the vlt to search for forming clusters ( protoclusters ) around hzrgs at redshifts 2 and higher .",
    "the first radio galaxy field we observed was tn j13381942 at a redshift of 4.1 @xcite .",
    "this hzrg is one of the brightest and most luminous in ly@xmath0  known .",
    "both its ly@xmath0  profile and radio structure are very asymmetric @xcite , which indicates strong interaction with dense gas , and the rest - frame radio luminosity is comparable to that of the most luminous 3cr sources ( p@xmath10 erg s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 ) . here",
    "we report on the discovery of a substantial overdensity of ly@xmath0  emitters around this radio galaxy at @xmath11.-dominated cosmology with h@xmath12 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is assumed . ]",
    "we carried out narrow- and broadband imaging on 2001 march 25 and 26 with the 8.2 m vlt kueyen ( ut2 ) , using the imaging mode of the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) . at @xmath15 the ly@xmath0  emission line",
    "is redshifted to 6202  , which falls in our custom narrowband filter with a central wavelength of 6195   and fwhm of 60  .",

    "we took 18 separate 1800 s exposures and one 900 s exposure in the narrow band and 21 exposures of 300 s in @xmath16 , shifted by @xmath17  with respect to each other to minimize flat - fielding problems and to handle cosmic rays .",
    "the nights were photometric and the average seeing in both narrowband and broadband images was 065 . the 1 @xmath18 limiting magnitude per square arcsecond was 28.6 for the narrowband and 29.2 for the broadband image . for the flux calibration the spectrophotometric standard",

    "the 1 @xmath18 limiting magnitude per square arcsecond was about 27.8 in both bands .    for the detection and photometry of objects in the images",
    ", we used the object detection and classification program sextractor @xcite .",
    "detected objects had at least 9 connected pixels with values larger than the rms sky noise on the narrowband image . a photometric analysis",
    "was then carried out on both the narrowband and the broadband image . in total 2407 objects",
    "were extracted .",
    "based on the statistics of our detection of ly@xmath0  emitters around pks 1138262 , we selected objects with a rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath24 greater than 15   ( or @xmath25 @xmath26 ) and significance @xmath27 as candidate ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies , with @xmath28 the ratio of continuum - subtracted counts in the narrowband to the combined noise in the broadband and narrowband @xcite .",
    "of the 2407 objects , 34 objects satisfied these criteria , including the radio galaxy .",

    "three of these objects are located in the halo of the radio galaxy , which affects the narrowband photometry .",
    "the other two are likely to be foreground objects with another line falling in the narrowband filter , e.g.  [ ] @xmath32 or [ ] @xmath33 . excluding the radio galaxy ,",
    "the resulting 28 objects were our ly@xmath0-emitting candidates for follow - up spectroscopy .      on 2001",
    "may 20 , 21 , and 22 we carried out spectroscopy using fors2 in the mask multiobject spectroscopy mode with standard resolution .",
    "the nights were photometric with an average seeing of 1 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the 600ri grism with a dispersion of 1.32   pixel@xmath1 and a wavelength range from 5300   to 8000  .",
    "this grism was preferred because of its high throughput ( peak efficiency is 87% ) .",
    "two different masks were used to observe 23 of the candidate ly@xmath0  emitters and the radio galaxy , with slit sizes of 1 , resulting in a resolution of 6  , which corresponds to 290 km s@xmath1 at @xmath20 .",
    "the total exposure time was 31,500 s for the first mask and 35,100 s for the second mask .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from exposures of he , ar , ne , and hgcd arc - lamps .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength calibration was better than 0.05  .",
    "for the flux calibration , long slit exposures with a 5  slit were used of the spectrophotometric standard stars eg 274 and ltt 7987 @xcite .",
    "of the 23 candidates observed , 20 show an emission line with a peak between @xmath34   and @xmath35  .",
    "the signal - to - noise of these lines is at least 10 .",
    "ten randomly selected spectra from our sample are shown in figure [ 10specs ] .",
    "two nondetections were very faint ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively ) .",
    "the third nondetection had a very low surface brightness .",
    "the success rate of our selection criteria was therefore 87% .",
    "the first question is whether the detected lines are indeed due to ly@xmath0  at the redshift of the radio galaxy .",
    "intervening neutral hydrogen will absorb emission blueward of the lya line @xcite .",
    "this discontinuity of the continuum over the lya emission line is observed in one of the spectra , but the continuum emission of the other emitters was too faint to be detected ( r @xmath38 ) .",
    "identification of the lines with [ ] @xmath32 at @xmath39 can be excluded , because of the lack of confirming lines [ ] @xmath40 and h@xmath41 in the spectra .",
    "the position of the emitter within the slit mask determines the wavelength coverage of the resulting spectrum . in 9 cases this coverage was suitable to exclude the identification with [ ] @xmath42 at @xmath43 on similar grounds .",
    "the detected emitters are anyway unlikely to be foreground [ ] galaxies .",
    "first of all , if one of the lines would be [ ] , then the rest - frame equivalent width would be at least 70  .",
    "a survey of nearby field galaxies , conducted by @xcite , gives a mean ew@xmath44 of the [ ] line of @xmath45   for galaxies with @xmath46 , which roughly compares to r @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "only 2 galaxies out of 159 galaxies with [ ] in emission have ew@xmath44 ( [ ] ) @xmath49  .",
    "the number of [ ] emitters expected in our field , using another study @xcite , is @xmath50 .",
    "again , only a few percent of the [ ] emitters observed by hogg et al .",
    "have an ew@xmath51  .",
    "therefore , from our sample of 20 emitters , @xmath52 is expected to be an [ ] emitter .",
    "additional evidence that the observed lines are predominantly ly@xmath0lines at @xmath11 associated with the radio galaxy is provided by their velocity distribution , which has a dispersion of @xmath53 km s@xmath1 and a fwhm of @xmath54 km s@xmath1 ( fig .  [ vdist ] ) , which is 4 times smaller than the fwhm of the narrowband filter . further , the velocity distribution peaks within 200 km s@xmath1 of the radio galaxy ly@xmath0  peak , corrected for absorption @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons we interpret the observed emission lines as ly@xmath0 . to estimate the redshifts , flux densities , and widths ( fwhm ) of the lines , a gaussian function was fitted to each of the one - dimensional spectra .",
    "details will be provided in a future paper ( b.p .",
    "venemans et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the next question to be addressed is to what extent the statistics of our detections represent a significant overdensity of galaxies in the field .",
    "a `` blank - field '' study of ly@xmath0  emitters at approximately the same redshift is the large - area lyman alpha survey ( lala survey , * ? ? ?",
    "preliminary results of this survey indicate a number density of @xmath55 deg@xmath56 @xmath57 for objects with ew@xmath58  and line + continuum @xmath59 erg s@xmath1 cm@xmath56 . for our field",
    "the second criterion corresponds to @xmath61 and we expect @xmath62 such ly@xmath0  emitters within our probed volume .",
    "however , 9 of the confirmed emitters satisfy the above criteria ( including the radio galaxy ) . in our cosmology the comoving volume density of the lala survey is @xmath63 mpc@xmath64 .",
    "the volume density in our field is @xmath65 mpc@xmath66 mpc@xmath64 .",
    "the difference in number density is @xmath67/@xmath68 .",
    "however , the fwhm of the velocity distribution is approximately 4 times smaller than the fwhm of the filter ( see fig .  [ vdist ] ) .",
    "this implies that our radio galaxy field is overdense in ly@xmath0  emitters by a factor of 15 compared with a blank field .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emitters is not homogeneous ( fig.[sdist ] ) .",
    "the structure appears to be bound in the northwest but our fov is not large enough to show a boundary in the south .",
    "the size of the structure is therefore at least 6@xmath3 4 , which corresponds to greater than 2.7 mpc @xmath3 1.8 mpc .",
    "remarkably , the radio galaxy , probably the most massive system in the structure , does not appear to be at the center of the protocluster , in disagreement with models for the formation of dominant cluster galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radio galaxy is located close to the apparent north - west boundary of the galaxy overdensity structure .",
    "the radio emission is dominated by two components , separated by 55 @xcite .",
    "the brightest component coincides with the optical emission , while the other is in the south - east , towards the center of the galaxy overdensity .",
    "a spectacular feature of the radio galaxy , visible in the narrowband image , is the large ly@xmath0  halo ( fig .",
    "[ halo ] ) .",
    "although giant ly@xmath0  halos are a common feature of hzrgs , they are usually fairly symmetrically extended around the radio galaxy . in the case of tn",
    "j13381942 , the halo is highly asymmetric and extends for @xmath17  ( 110 kpc ) to the north - west , i.e. , away from the center of the overdensity structure . in its narrowness and asymmetry",
    "the tn j13381942 halo is unique among known distant radio galaxies .",
    "possible mechanisms to produce this structure include cooling flows in colliding sub - structures and buoyancy effects @xcite and will be considered in a subsequent paper .",
    "could the structure that we have detected be a protocluster at @xmath69 that will evolve into a rich cluster of galaxies in the local universe ? at @xmath2 the universe is @xmath70 gyr old , too short for the structure to have virialized since the mean crossing time for galaxies at the observed velocity dispersion is at least 4 gyr .",
    "thus the observed velocities are probably infall velocities of the galaxies accreting onto a large overdensity .",
    "the total mass of this structure can be estimated by using @xmath71 with @xmath72 the mean density of the universe and @xmath73 the mass overdensity within our volume @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the mass overdensity is related to the galaxy overdensity @xmath75 through @xmath76 , where @xmath77 takes into account the redshift space distortions caused by peculiar velocities and @xmath4 is the bias parameter . from the statistics of redshift `` spikes '' ,",
    "@xcite argue that @xmath78 .",
    "taking @xmath4 in the range 35 and assuming that the structure is just breaking away from the hubble expansion , @xmath73 is estimated to be 0.52.3 , giving a mass of our structure of ( 12 ) @xmath79 @xmath6 .",
    "this is comparable to the mass of the lyman break galaxy overdensity ( spike ) found by steidel et al .  and",
    "to that of the coma cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is instructive to compare the number of luminous radio sources at @xmath80 to the number of redshift spikes .",
    "@xcite estimate that about one velocity spike is detected in each 9@xmath3 18  field in their spectroscopic survey , corresponding to @xmath81 redshift spikes in the whole sky .",
    "their survey is sensitive to redshifts between 2.7 and 3.4 , corresponding to a cosmic evolution time of 0.6 gyr .",
    "how many luminous radio sources are there at @xmath80 ? using the pure luminosity evolution model of @xcite to describe the steep spectrum radio luminosity function , we estimate that in the redshift range @xmath82 there should be @xmath83 radio sources with luminosities exceeding @xmath84 erg s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 at 2.7 ghz ( `` cygnus a type '' radio sources : p@xmath85(cygnus a ) @xmath86 erg s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 , becker , white , & edwards 1991 ) . assuming that hzrgs are only once active for @xmath87 yr @xcite",
    ", we expect the number of ( previously ) active radio sources in this redshift range to be @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the luminosity functions and lifetimes of luminous radio sources are consistent with every velocity `` spike '' in the space densities of lyman break galaxies being associated with a massive galaxy that has been or will become a luminous radio source once .",
    "note that @xcite presented similar statistical evidence to argue that distant powerful radio galaxies are the precursors of cd galaxies at the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "we have found a structure of 20 ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies around the high redshift radio galaxy tn j13381942 .",
    "the overdensity of this protocluster is on the order of 15 compared to field samples .",
    "our results demonstrate that by @xmath20 , megaparsec - scale structure had already formed .    together with our previous data",
    ", this implies that the most luminous radio sources are tracers of regions of galaxy overdensity in the early universe .",
    "the estimated masses of @xmath9  @xmath89 @xmath6 are consistent with the overdensities being ancestors of rich clusters of galaxies in the local universe .",
