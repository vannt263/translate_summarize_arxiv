    "the development of micro - pattern - gas - detectors ( mpgds ) expands the field of application for detectors based on gas multiplication .",
    "in particular , a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) wit mpgd readout is foreseen in the ild detector concept for the ilc @xcite .",
    "r&d towards such a tpc is carried out within the lctpc collaboration @xcite for the prototypes presented here the conventional pad readout of gems , with a typical pad size in the order of a few @xmath2 , is replaced by a highly integrated device , the timepix cmos pixel asic @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this concept is the small pixel size of the timepix , with @xmath3 matching the typical granularity of the gems .",
    "tests with the triple gem / timepix setup developed at the university of freiburg have been performed in a 5gev electron beam at desy .",
    "the bonn setup consists of a tpc fieldcage with 26 cm drift length .",
    "this allows to study cluster and track properties for longer drift distances .",
    "a gem @xcite is a thin metal - coated polymer foil with a high density of chemically etched holes arranged in a regular pattern .",
    "two different pitch - geometries are investigated .",
    "first standard gems , with 70@xmath4  hole diameter and 140@xmath4  hole pitch had been investigated .",
    "then tests with a smaller pitched gem @xcite were performed .",
    "these gems , like standard gems , have the same thicknesses for the kapton@xmath5 and copper layers .",
    "however the holes have an outer diameter of 30@xmath4  and a pitch of 50@xmath4  and the active surface is @xmath6 .",
    "[ gem_garf ] shows the electrostatic potential ( green ) and field ( red ) for two gem holes .",

    "65536 pixels are arranged in a square matrix of @xmath7 lines and columns . as the size of each pixel cell",
    "is @xmath8 the total active surface is @xmath9 .",
    "a reference frequency is distributed throughout the entire chip . for each pixel one of the following four modes can be set individually :    tot : : :    in the `` time - over - threshold '' mode measures time a signal is above an    adjustable threshold .",
    "time : : :    in the time - mode measures time from the point the signal crosses the    adjusted threshold until a common stop by a gate signal called    `` shutter '' .",
    "medipix : : :    in the medipix - mode the number of hits crossing an adjustable    threshold are recorded .",
    "onehit : : :    the first signal crossing the adjusted threshold sets the counter to    one .",
    "any further hits will be ignored .",
    "to record simultaneously time and tot information the timepix is operated in a special mode : in a checkerboard - like fashion consecutive pixels are set to tot and time mode .",
    "consequently half of the pixels record time , while the other half records tot .",
    "the timepix is positioned at the underneath a triple gem stack as shown in fig .",

    "the gem stack is operated at a nominal gain of @xmath10 with an @xmath11 70/30 gas mixture .",

    "[ stack_tel_fig ] the setup is positioned in between the two sensor layers of a si - strip - telescope @xcite .",
    "the telescope has a 50@xmath4  readout pitch and is used for external track determination .",

    "[ eventdispay ]",
    "in fig . [ eventdispay ] a typical event is shown . using an adapted zeus cluster splitting algorithm @xcite typically @xmath14 clusters are reconstructed in an event , while from simulations @xcite about 40 clusters are expected for ar / co@xmath15 70/30 .",
    "the evaluation followed the methods presented in @xcite : first a straight line was fitted to all @xmath16 cluster centroids and the respective n residuals were calculated .",
    "after this one cluster had been exempted and a fit to the remaining @xmath17 clusters was performed .",
    "the deviation was calculated for the excluded cluster and then the method was repeated for all remaining permutations of clusters . from the width of both residual - distribution , denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the geometric mean @xmath20 was calculated .",
    "this yields an unbiased estimator for the resolution .",
    "the spatial resolution @xmath21 depends on the transverse diffusion along the drift path : @xmath22[old_formula ] , with @xmath23 denotes the best achievable resolution for zero drift distance , @xmath24 the constant of transverse diffusion and @xmath25 the number of primary electrons contributing to a cluster . + using the information from the si - strip telescope the events were sorted into bins of @xmath26 along the drift distance @xmath27 .",
    "the resolution at zero drift was extrapolated from a fit of @xmath21 to the measured values @xmath28 in fig.[sigmay ] . including the systematic uncertainty for @xmath23 of about @xmath29 due to the position of the si - telescope relative to the gem / timepix detector , the result for the standard gems was @xmath30 and for the smaller pitched gems @xmath31 .",
    "the time - measurements showed a dependency on the pulse height ( time walk ) as displayed in fig .",

    "time - values measured next to pixels with small tot seemed to arrive systematically later compared to time - values which lay close to pixels with a large tot - value . from the tot - time - correlation",
    "a correction function had been derived and was applied to the mixed mode data .",
    "[ timeres ] shows the deviations of ( corrected ) time - values at the center of a cluster relative to the mean time of the corresponding event .",
    "the achieved time resolution is @xmath32 , which is smaller than the used clock period of 10ns .        with the bonn setup , cluster and track properties",
    "could be studied over a much longer drift path .",
    "analysis of this data @xcite revealed that the parametrization of @xmath33 used for the test beam data does not describe the data for drift distances - axis . ] above several centimeters .",

    "the average resolution between @xmath39 of @xmath40 is in agreement with the results from the freiburg setup with very short drift volume . +",
    "but with such a good resolution the discrete nature of the gem holes and the readout starts to matter .",
    "this can be seen nicely from figure [ hole_pattern ] , where a two dimensional histogram of the reconstructed cluster centroids from a sr@xmath1 is shown .",

    "the charge per cluster in fig .",
    "[ charge_per_cluster ] decreases for larger @xmath34 . as indicated before ,",
    "this observation can be explained with two arguments : first , for short drift distances , several primary electrons contribute to a reconstructed cluster .",
    "hence the number of distinct clusters is small , but the charge per cluster is large .",
    "second , for drift distances above several centimeters , the transverse diffusion is large enough to separate primary electrons far enough , so that they are reconstructed as individual clusters .",
    "consequently the charge per cluster takes its minimum , while the number of clusters is maximal ( `` declustering '' ) .",
