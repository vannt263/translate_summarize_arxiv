    "the location of the hotspot is coincident with the downstream region of the jet termination shock , where particles accelerated by the shock emit synchrotron radiation .",

    "the turnover in the synchrotron spectrum between infrared ( ir ) and optical wavelengths implies that the cr electron scattering length is much longer than the larmor radius and consistent with the amplified magnetic field being structured on very small scales and comparable with the ion skin - depth @xmath7 .",

    "such a large ratio between emitting volumes is not implausible provided the magnetic field is inhomogeneous in the shock downstream region and the synchrotron emitter consists of features smaller than the merlin point spread function ( fwhm @xmath72 ) as seen in parts of the merlin data .",

    "this very hard spectrum is unlikely since it diverges toward high energy and would be remarkable in hotspots , supporting the conclusion that the downstream radio extent @xmath78 must be determined by factors other than synchrotron cooling . as we discuss in sect .",

    ".      optical emission produced by synchrotron radiation of electrons with @xmath84 is almost co - spatial with the ir emission , and this explains the linear structure cupped within @xmath78 . ] .",

    "the amplification of the magnetic field at strong shocks in supernova remnants was demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , deriving the magnetic field from @xmath64 downstream of the shock .",
    "a theoretical explanation was provided by @xcite showing that non - resonant hybrid instabilities are capable of enhancing the magnetic field by orders of magnitude .",
    "magnetic field amplification is also responsible for @xmath68  @xmath6 g in the southern arc in 4c74.26 since it is much larger than the expected value in the jet upstream of the termination shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bohm diffusion ( electron mean free path @xmath89 ) in a @xmath2100  @xmath6 g magnetic field would be expected to accelerate electrons with synchrotron x - ray emitting energies as seen in supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath90 determined by a competition between shock acceleration and synchrotron cooling indicates that acceleration is slow and therefore that the electron diffusion coefficient @xmath91 is much larger than the bohm value @xmath92 : @xmath93 independent of @xmath5 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a large diffusion coefficient in an amplified magnetic field is expected if it is structured on a scale @xmath94 much smaller than the larmor radius of the electrons being accelerated .",
    "small angle scattering by magnetic field randomly orientated in cells of size @xmath94 produces @xmath95 and then @xmath96 in comparison the ion skin - depth is @xmath97  cm , where @xmath98 is the particle density downstream of the shock ( assumed to be @xmath99 times the jet density ) , and @xmath100    given the uncertainties in the parameter values , the approximate nature of the theoretical models , and the wide range of the spatial scales ( @xmath94 , @xmath4 , @xmath78 ) , it is not significant or surprising that our estimate of @xmath101 differs from unity by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "the order of magnitude similarity of @xmath94 and @xmath7 supports the contention that shock - generated small - scale turbulence scatters non - thermal electrons during diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who discuss the various processes related to the weibel instability that excite turbulence on the characteristic scale of @xmath7 .",
    "simulations show that magnetic field generated by the weibel instability decays downstream of the shock because of its relatively small scalelength @xcite .",
    "this would account for the cut - off of synchrotron emission in 4c74.26 far short of the synchrotron cooling distance of radio - emitting electrons ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "these electrons continue up - scattering cmb photons , thus producing ic x - ray emission downstream of the shock after the merlin radio emission has ceased .",
    "since the response of highly relativistic ions is similar to that of electrons with the same energy in a tangled amplified magnetic field , we can expect protons to have a similar ratio of @xmath104 .",
    "protons can be accelerated to higher energies than electrons because their radiative losses are minimal , but the maximum energy to which they are accelerated is limited because their acceleration time is increased by the ratio @xmath104 .",
    "the hillas parameter @xmath105 @xcite , where @xmath106 ( @xmath107  kpc ) is the characteristic length of the source , would suggest proton acceleration to @xmath2100  eev in the termination shock of 4c74.26 , but the maximum energy is reduced to only @xmath2100  tev if @xmath108 since the hillas parameter assumes @xmath109 and is otherwise reduced by the factor @xmath110 .",
    "another perspective on the same effect is that the mean free path for scattering by small - scale turbulence @xmath111 is larger than the size of the system if @xmath112 and @xmath4 is the larmor radius of an eev proton .",
    "this result suggests that the mildly relativistic termination shock in 4c74.26 is a poor accelerator of uhecr .",
    "we model the radio to x - ray emission in the southern hotspot of the fr  ii galaxy 4c74.26 .",
    "our study is based on three key observational features : 1 ) compact merlin emission region : it is too thin to be the result of fast synchrotron cooling ( sect .  [ radio ] ) .",
    "2 ) the radio to ir spectrum ( @xmath36 ) is too flat for the emitting volume to be determined by synchrotron cooling through this wavelength range ( sect .",
    "3 ) the turnover of the synchrotron spectrum at ir / optical frequencies requires @xmath113 for any reasonable shock velocity ( sect .",
    "[ mfa ] ) .",
    "these three features fit well in a scenario in which the merlin radio emission traces out the region where the magnetic field is amplified by plasma instabilities with small length scale ( e.g. weibel ) .",
    "the magnetic field in equipartition with non - thermal electrons in the merlin emission region is @xmath2100  @xmath6 g and similar to the values obtained by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an unrealistically large magnetic field @xmath114  mg would be needed to explain the compact radio emission in terms of synchrotron cooling . if @xmath68  @xmath6 g in the synchrotron emission region , the maximum energy of non - thermal electrons is @xmath20.3  tev .    if ions are accelerated as well , protons with energy @xmath20.3  tev diffuse also with mean free path @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath115 is similarly larger than the larmor radius at higher proton energies , then the maximum proton energy at the termination shock of 4c74.26 is only @xmath62  tev instead of the @xmath62  eev indicated by the hillas parameter .",
