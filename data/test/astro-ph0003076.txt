    "as part of our investigation of steep - spectrum ( @xmath5 , s@xmath6 ) , low - frequency - variable ( lfv ; @xmath7 1 ghz ) sources , we have made a series of images with sub - arcsecond resolutions ( mantovani et al .",
    "1992 ) of a sample of sources .",
    "these sources were selected from the papers of cotton ( 1976 ) , mcadam ( 1980 ) , spangler & cotton ( 1981 ) , fanti et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and altschuler et al .",
    "the aim was to detect the high - brightness components required by the refractive scintillation model for low - frequency variability ( rickett 1986 ) .",
    "most of the sources in the sample showed compact features ( deconvolved sizes @xmath8 0.15  0.3 arcsec ) both in merlin , 408 mhz and vla , a - array , 5 ghz images ( mantovani et al .",
    "further observations with vlbi show these features to contain components which are bright and compact enough to explain the variability at low frequency by propagation effects in the interstellar medium ; see , for example , 3c99 , mantovani et al .",
    "( 1990a ) .",
    "sources such as these do not generally show any variability at high frequency ( padrielli et al .",
    "1987 ) .    however , there are sources like 0621 + 400 ( 3c159 ) , which are variable at low frequencies and not at frequencies @xmath9ghz , where the compact components are too weak to account for the observed variability . in these cases , it is possible that the variability is caused by instrumental effects . the source 3c159 has been monitored for about 10 years at 408 mhz .",
    "this source has a steep radio spectrum and an extended double radio structure  a combination which is very unusual for a variable radio source .",
    "browne et al.(1985 ) have suggested that the variations , which seem to show an annual cycle , may not be intrinsic but could arise from the combined effects of strong source linear polarization and ionospheric faraday rotation .",
    "ionospheric faraday rotation can easily reach 78 rad m@xmath10 ( sakurai & spangler 1994 ) . with the plausible estimate of 5 rad m@xmath10 as an expectable difference in the ionospheric rm",
    ", one finds that the position angle difference at 408 mhz is 2.7 radians ; enough to produce the effect being discussed .",
    "merlin observations at 408 mhz ( cerchiara et al .",
    "1994 ) show that 3c159 is highly polarized ( @xmath1110@xmath12 ) .",
    "the plane of polarization of the source emission could be rotated by changes in ionospheric faraday rotation relative to the linearly polarized e - w arm of the northern cross bologna telescope used for the monitoring program . a source with a linear polarization",
    "@xmath136@xmath12 could exhibit apparent variations of roughly the observed size if the ionospheric faraday rotation changed by @xmath1190@xmath14 between observations .",
    "the 3c159 observations were made at transit during the day in summer and the night in winter and so they were accompanied by annual changes in the ionospheric electron content .    the purported variability measured in the two extended radio sources 0235@xmath3197 and 1203@xmath4043 may have originated in a similar manner to that in 3c159 .",
    "they were monitored at 408 mhz with a similar instrument , the molonglo cross . with a peak - to - peak fractional variability of @xmath1110%",
    ", they were classified as ` probably variable ' by mcadam ( 1980 ) .",
    "consequently , although it was expected that most of the sources belonging to our sample of steep - spectrum , low - frequency - variable sources would be core - dominated sources , it is likely that the sample has been contaminated by lobe - dominated , strongly - linearly - polarized , extended sources .    in order to test",
    "if ionospheric faraday rotation is the cause of the apparent variability of 0235@xmath3197 and 1203@xmath4043 we have investigated the linear polarizations of these sources at 320mhz with the vla in the ` a ' configuration and with the already available 5ghz vla c - array data .",
    "both sources were also observed in the x ( 8.4  ghz ) and u ( 15  ghz ) bands .",
    "these observations allowed high resolution images of the hot spot regions to be made . the images were combined with available , high - resolution , c band observations to produce rotation measures ( rms ) for the outer parts of the sources .",
    "vla ( thompson et al .  1980 ) observing dates and observational parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the high resolution ( a - array ) total intensity images at 5 ghz for 0235@xmath3197 and 1203@xmath4043 were presented in mantovani et al .",
    "( 1992 ) while the lower resolution c - array , total intensity map for 0235@xmath3197 has been published in morganti , killeen & tadhunter ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , because the polarization information was never presented in the earlier papers , we have summarized in the tables all the observational details and the derived parameters from those observations .    [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "due to the non - detection of polarized emission at 320mhz in both 0235@xmath3197 and 1203@xmath4043 , we can not explain the low frequency variability observed with the molonglo cross ( mcadam 1980 ) in terms of ionospheric faraday rotation as in the case of 3c159",
    ".    can refractive scintillation ( rickett , 1986 ) explain the variability of 0235@xmath3197 ?",
    "the refractive scintillation models assume a supposedly - variable radio source to have most of its flux density in a single compact component .",
    "the degree of variability is a function of the characterization of the interstellar medium ( itself a function of galactic coordinates ) and source size . 0235@xmath3197",
    "is at galactic latitude @xmath15 and was reported to vary ( rms variability @xmath16 jy ) on a time scale of the order of 1 year ( mcadam , 1980 ) .    in the usual refractive model of interstellar turbulence ( mantovani et al .",
    "1990b , spangler et al .",
    "1993 , spangler et al .",
    "1994 , bondi et al .",
    "1994 ) , the relevant parameter for the observed scintillation index is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the parameter indicator of the source structure ( @xmath20 for a gaussian structure ) . in such a model",
    "a source of ( @xmath21jy ) with a rms variability of 0.2jy and corresponding scintillation index of @xmath22 should have an angular diameter in the range 1020 mas ( see spangler et al .",
    "1993 for details ) .",
    "the @xmath23 hot spot has a spectrum which , extrapolated towards lower frequencies , gives a mean flux density of @xmath113 jy at 408 mhz .",
    "this is comparable to the peak flux density found at 320 mhz .",
    "the crucial parameter is , however , the angular size of the hot spot . the deconvolved size found for the @xmath23 hot spot at 15 ghz is @xmath80.2 arcsec .",
    "even if in principle there is not contradiction , the scintillation theory requires an angular size for the hot spot in 0235@xmath3197 that is a factor 710 smaller than the size measured at 15ghz , which is close to the sizes usually measured for the hot spots .",
    "low frequency vlbi observations are needed to confirm the existence of such a compact component in the hot spot .",
    "the lack of polarized emission at 320mhz for 1203@xmath4043 and a radio structure which lacks a bright compact component rules out both of the mechanisms for low frequency variability in this source .",
    "consequently , we conclude that this source might be a spurious case of variability",
    ". however , 1203@xmath4043 has an interesting structure at 320mhz .",
    "it shows a pair of secondary lobes in a direction perpendicular to the main source axis , making the object one of a few known ` x'-shaped sources . at present , only about ten sources are known to show such morphology .",
    "they are believed to have both young and old lobes .",
    "these lobes may be supplied by jets whose direction has changed with time . a change in the orientation of the central engine due to precession has been suggested by ekers et al .",
    "( 1978 ) for ngc326 to account for its ` x ' shaped morphology .",
    "such a model has been applied successfully to 0828@xmath432 by klein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) but with the extra assumption that the length of the precessing beam changes with time . a merger between galaxies is thought to be the cause of the precession .",
    "however , ulrich - demoulin & rnnback ( 1996 ) have reported that optical images of 0828@xmath432 do not show the signature of a recent major merger event .",
    "however , the structure of 1203@xmath4043 looks peculiar when compared with other x shaped sources .",
    "for example , it has an asymmetric structure with respect to the component c which is believed to be the core ( fig .  7 and fig .",
    "6 in mantovani et al .",
    "the long , bent jet is clearly one - sided while , generally speaking , the members of the class show two - sided jets ( at the available resolution ) .",
    "moreover , the young lobes of the x shaped sources are dominated by hot spots while here the jet emission fades away from the core and the northern lobe contains only diffuse emission without any bright component .",
    "this asymmetry is reflected in the 320 mhz map where the region to the north - west is more extended and brighter than the opposite side .",
    "we have conducted a program of multi - wavelength vla observations of the suspected low frequency variable sources 0235@xmath3197 and 1203 + 043 .",
    "since 0235@xmath3197 is not polarized at 320mhz , its variability can not be accounted for by instrumental polarization effects as in the case of 3c159 .",
    "0235@xmath3197 may contain a low frequency component sufficiently compact and bright as required by the refractive scintillation model for low frequency variability .",
    "our observations have insufficient resolution to test this suggestion ; low frequency vlbi observations are required for this purpose . however , this component would have to have extremely unusual properties among hot spots in radio sources .",
    "in our high frequency images of 1203 + 043 we have identified the core of the radio source ; its location indicates that the source has a large apparent asymmetry . at 320mhz",
    ", this source shows no polarization .",
    "however , it does have an additional , steep - spectrum component at this frequency ; this previously - undetected component lies perpendicular to the main axis and predominantly to one side .",
    "however , the overall morphology of 1203 + 043 at low frequencies seems similar to that of the ` x'-shaped sources like ngc326 . from its morphology and component sizes ,",
    "we conclude that 1203 + 043 is likely not variable at low frequencies and that its inclusion in such catalogs is spurious .",
