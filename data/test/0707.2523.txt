    "in next future the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start its experimental physics program .",
    "currently , there is a great expectation that lhc shall discover the higgs boson and whatever new physics beyond the standard model that may accompany it , such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , several questions remain open in the standard model , which will be probed in a new kinematical regime at the lhc and determine the background for new physics . in particular",
    ", the description of the high energy regime of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) still is a subject of intense debate ( for recent reviews see e.g. ref .",
    "theoretically , at high energies ( small bjorken-@xmath3 ) one expects the transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics , where only the parton emissions are considered , to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important in the parton cascade and the evolution is given by a nonlinear evolution equation .",
    "this regime is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction ( parton saturation ) , with the transition being specified by a typical scale , which is energy dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , possible signals of parton saturation have already been observed both in @xmath5 deep inelastic scattering at hera and in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "although the geometrical scaling and the diffractive events observed at hera , as well as the high-@xmath6 suppression observed at rhic , have a natural interpretation in terms of the saturation physics , none of these phenomena can be taken as a conclusive evidence for a new regime of the qcd dynamics .",
    "this is due to the kinematical limitations of the experiments .",
    "consequently , the observation of this new regime still needs confirmation and so there has bee an active search for new experimental signatures .    in the last years we have proposed the analysis of coherent hadron - hadron collisions as an alternative way to study the qcd dynamics at high energies @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in coherent hadron collisions is that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadrons and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators ( for a review see ref .",
    "consequently , studies of @xmath7 interactions at lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the photon - hadron interactions can be divided into exclusive and inclusive reactions . in the first case ,",
    "a certain particle is produced while the target remains in the ground state ( or is only internally excited ) .",
    "on the other hand , in inclusive interactions the particle produced is accompanied by one or more particles from the breakup of the target .",
    "the typical examples of these processes are the exclusive vector meson production , described by the process @xmath8",
    "( @xmath9 ) , and the inclusive heavy quark production [ @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ] , respectively .",
    "recently , we have discussed both processes considering @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite collisions as an alternative to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "our results demonstrate that their detection is feasible at the lhc .",
    "however , some of these results were obtained considering the saturation model proposed by golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) several years ago @xcite .",
    "that model has been improved recently considering the current state - of - the - art of saturation physics : the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates a revision of some our previous estimates . in particular , in this paper",
    "we revise our predictions for @xmath1 production in coherent @xmath0 collisions .",
    "another goal is to present , for the first time , predictions for the @xmath2 production in coherent collisions considering the cgc formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section ( section [ coerente ] ) we present a brief review of coherent hadron - hadron interactions , introducing the main formulae . in section [ dinamica ]",
    "we discuss the qcd dynamics and the saturation model used in the calculations . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we compare our predictions for the @xmath7 cross section with the hera data and present the predictions for quarkonium production in hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "moreover , we compare the current results to related approaches available in the literature . finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "lets consider the hadron - hadron interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath15 ) and at ultra relativistic energies . in this regime",
    "we expect the electromagnetic interaction to be dominant . in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , which can interact with each other . in a similar way",
    ", it also occurs when considering ultra relativistic protons in @xmath16 colliders .",
    "the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( two - photon process ) or can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) .",
    "one has that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section @xcite . in general , the cross sections for @xmath17 interactions are two ( or three ! ) order of magnitude larger than for @xmath18 interactions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in what follows",
    "our main focus shall be in photon - hadron processes .",

    "some comments are in order here .",
    "firstly , the coherence condition limits the photon virtuality to very low values , which implies that for most purposes , they can be considered as real .",

    "@xmath39 energy @xmath40 gev .",
    "therefore , while studies of photoproduction at hera are limited to photon - proton center of mass energies of about 200 gev , photon - hadron interactions at lhc can reach one order of magnitude higher on energy .",
    "consequently , studies of coherent interactions at the lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "secondly , in @xmath13 interactions one have that due to the asymmetry in the collision , with the ion being likely the photon emitter , the photon direction is known , which will implicate an asymmetry in the rapidity distribution ( see below ) .",
    "finally , in this work we consider that the produced state @xmath30 represents a quarkonium ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "since photon emission is coherent over the entire nucleus and the photon is colorless we expect that the events to be characterized by @xmath41 and two rapidity gaps .",
    "let us consider photon - hadron scattering in the dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath42 long after the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron @xcite . in the dipole picture",
    "the amplitude for vector meson production reads as ( see e.g. refs .",

    "@xmath102 ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) , one have that the photoproduction cross section is smaller by approximately three order of magnitudes for proton - proton collisions . for nuclear collisions ,",
    "this factor is smaller due to presence of shadowing corrections .",
    "although the photoproduction cross section would be a small factor of the hadronic cross section , the separation of this channel is feasible if we impose the presence of two rapidity gaps in the final state .",
    "this should eliminate almost all of the hadroproduction events while retaining most of the photoproduction interactions .",
    "however , two rapidity gaps in the final state can also be generated in exclusive hadron - hadron interactions , characterized by the process @xmath103 .",

    "@xcite considering the pomeron - odderon fusion ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite the separation of odderon and photon contributions ahould be feasible by the analysis of the outgoing momenta distribution",
    ". however , this subject deserves more detailed studies , which we postpone for a future publication .",
    "the qcd dynamics at high energies is of utmost importance for building a realistic description of @xmath0 collisions at lhc . in this limit qcd evolution leads to a system with high gluon density .",
