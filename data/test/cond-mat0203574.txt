    "a general method for calculating electronic transport properties is provided by the use of non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf).@xcite because it has a fully quantum mechanical and non - equilibrium formulation , and because its foundational assumptions are transparent , this technique has been used to study a very wide range of transport problems .    in this paper",
    "we will examine the way in which the leads permitting transport through an open quantum system ( a `` device '' ) can be replaced by self - energy terms in a dyson s equation .",
    "the analysis is limited to the case where the leads can be well - approximated as systems of non - interacting electrons in local thermodynamic equilibrium . in principle",
    "this approximation is not very restrictive , since sufficiently far even from a mesoscopic device the wires carrying current become macroscopic .",
    "notice that the device whose transport properties are being calculated is left completely unspecified  it can contain interactions , disorder , _",
    "etc_.    a similar treatment of the leads has been used by datta , in an approximation in which the spatial continuum is replaced by a lattice of discrete points.@xcite an apparently very different approach for continuum systems was developed in a series of papers by caroli and co - workers@xcite and by feuchtwang.@xcite the feuchtwang approach has been the basis of negf calculations by , for example , ref .  .",
    "other workers have also cast the continuum problem into a self - energy form.@xcite    our point here is to show that the feuchtwang approach for the continuum also can be repackaged so that leads are replaced exactly by simple self - energies , and to explore this possibility in some detail .",
    "we make two simple changes to feuchtwang s calculation : regrouping the dyson s equations to eliminate differential operators , and then using analytic continuation as provided by langreth s theorem@xcite ( and learned by us from haug and jaugho@xcite ; we will refer to this admirable textbook for all standard information about negf ) .",
    "the result is in our opinion pleasingly clear , and simplifies transport calculations of electronic devices .",
    "there is some freedom in how the self - energy is identified .",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath2 can in principle be arbitrarily separated into an unperturbed @xmath3 and a perturbation @xmath4 . if calculations can then be carried out exactly , the results will be independent of the initial separation .",
    "there is a similar arbitrariness in the definition of the unperturbed retarded @xmath5 and its corresponding retarded self - energy @xmath0 .",
    "( in the feuchtwang approach this comes from an arbitrary choice of internal boundary conditions ) .",
    "the exact green s functions are of course independent of this choice .",
    "it turns out , moreover , that the `` less - than '' self - energy @xmath6 is independent of this choice , for a broad class of internal boundary conditions .    for clarity we will focus on the simplest case : a one - dimensional system of non - interacting , spinless electrons in steady - state .",
    "but the results are rather general . for example , electron - electron and other interactions can be included by adding their appropriate self - energies to the coupling self - energy described here .",
    "extension to two and three dimensions is also straightforward .",
    "one motivation for this paper is that the approach we describe turns out to work well even for systems with irregular shapes.@xcite because the final results are independent of the choice of internal boundary conditions , in practice one should make whatever choice is simplest . in one dimension any choice is equally easy , but in higher dimensions with irregular shapes , the right choice can simplify the calculation considerably.@xcite    the model we will consider is an open one - dimensional system consisting of two leads l and r ( at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively ) , connected to a device d ( within @xmath9 ) .",

    "we will usually assume that @xmath14 ( but not @xmath15 ) are constants .",
    "the leads are treated as reservoirs of non - interacting electrons in local thermodynamic equilibrium described by local chemical potentials @xmath16 .",
    "an applied bias @xmath17 would be included by setting @xmath18 and perhaps @xmath19 .",
