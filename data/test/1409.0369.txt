    "the expression for @xmath12 in will also be adopted in the rest of the paper , for it is amenable to a physical interpretation based on the classical laws of impact dynamics ( see section  4[sec : dissipation_chains ] below ) .",

    "likewise , it reduces to the analogous equation ( 2.7)@xmath92 of @xcite , provided that there @xmath93 incorporates both the energy dissipated at the singular point and the power expended by the external force .",

    "this also shows that and together imply .",
    "thus , our interpretation of the evolution equations and as balance laws is completely justified . often in the following",
    "we shall turn to as an equivalent formulation for in the presence of a propagating shock , and so our theory will be based on , , and .",
    "the shocks considered in the preceding section , which manifest themselves at singular points in the middle of a moving string , will be called _ internal _ to distinguish them from the _ external _ shocks considered here .",
    "an external shock manifests itself whenever a moving string gets in contact with a still , shapeless reservoir from where it is ejected and set in motion or where it comes to an abrupt halt",
    ". this will be our way of treating continuous systems with a variable mass .",
    "essentially , this idea goes back to cayley  @xcite , who introduced the notion of _ continuously _ imparted impacts , equally able of setting resting matter in motion and of putting moving matter at rest . though our derivation of the balance equations governing an external shock will be similar to the one presented in section  2[sec : classical ] for internal shocks , the reader should not be deceived into thinking that an external shock is nothing but an internal shock with zero velocity on one side . in an external shock",
    "the string is supposed to be quiescent on one side of the shock , but its shape is completely undetermined and it only plays the role of providing sources for both linear momentum and energy .",
    "we distinguish two types of external shocks , as to whether the quiescent string follows or precedes the moving string .",
    "both situations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : external_shocks ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath96 and @xmath97 the sources of linear momentum and energy , respectively , for the former case , and by @xmath98 and @xmath99 the corresponding sources for the latter case .",
    "we note in passing that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the forces transferred to the quiescent string in the two case , while @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the corresponding energy sources for the quiescent string in the two cases . , these may equally well represent energy gains or energy losses . ]",
    "the external shock represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : external_shocks](a ) is characterized by a front @xmath104 evolving in time in both the reference and present configurations , so that the string s velocity @xmath4 jumps from @xmath105 to nought at the singular point @xmath106 . by requiring the velocity @xmath107 of the geometric point that instantaneously coincides with @xmath108 to vanish identically in time , as commanded by the kinematic compatibility with the quiescent string , we readily obtain that @xmath109 which here replaces",
    ". must be tangent to the moving string , and so this must move along its length at least just before coming to an abrupt stop . ]",
    "the balance of linear momentum for the arc of string in fig .",
    "[ fig : external_shocks](a ) , comprised between @xmath110 and @xmath111 , can be written in the form @xmath112 where as in section  [ sec : dissipation ] @xmath51 denotes the force acting per unit length of the string .",
    "accounting in for the dependence of @xmath113 on time and taking the limit as @xmath44 tends to @xmath113 , we arrive at @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the tension in the moving string at the singular point @xmath108 . by we",
    "give the following form @xmath116{\\bm{t}^\\ast_+}.\\ ] ] if the balance of linear momentum in echoes , the balance of energy in here becomes @xmath117 where account has also be taken of the fact that the force @xmath96 expends no power since @xmath118 . by performing the time differentiation in and then taking the limit as @xmath119 ,",
    "also with the aid of , we obtain the following balance law for the energy at the singular point @xmath108 , @xmath120{\\dot{s}^\\ast_+}.\\ ] ]    reasoning in exactly the same way , we derive the analogs of the kinematic condition and balance equations and at the singular point @xmath121 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : external_shocks](b ) where a quiescent string is abruptly set in motion .",
    "letting @xmath122 denote the velocity of the moving sting at @xmath121 and @xmath123 the inward unit tangent , we arrive at the following equations    @xmath124    @xmath125{\\bm{t}^\\ast_-},\\ ] ]    @xmath126{\\dot{s}^\\ast_-},\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 is the tension in the moving string at @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , kinematic compatibility requires the string to be injected at @xmath121 along its tangent and the balance of linear momentum requires the force @xmath98 to be directed along the string s tangent as well .    although equations and are valid in general , precisely as are and , they all are compatible with a special class of motions for a string which will be our object in the following sections , the one in which a string slides everywhere along its length .",
    "such motions are characterized by the kinematic requirement @xmath128 enforced along the entire moving string .",
    "it is compatible with the inextensibility constraint only is @xmath129 is assumed to be a function of time only , @xmath130 . under this assumption , both and reduce to    [ eq : external_shock_plus_minus ] @xmath131 and , , , and collectively simplify into @xmath132 @xmath133    these equations will often be called upon in the following .",
    "in the following sections we shall apply the general theory presented so far to three specific problems in the dynamics of chains . below in this section the reader will be introduced to these problems collectively , also indulging in some historical notes on the supposedly paradoxical aspects that they have shown since the work of buquoy nearly two centuries ago .. if attention is restricted to an appropriate subsystem , all the problems treated here could also be seen as problems for systems with a variable mass . ] before doing so , however , we need supplement the theory by showing that the choice for the shock dissipation @xmath12 in is the most appropriate for chains .      resuming the notation introduced in @xcite , for a shock in a chain",
    "we shall denote by @xmath90 the energy supply at a singular point , and so hereafter we shall set @xmath134    the kink formed in a chain where a shock is propagating through it is likely to involve an impact between the chain s links that come there in contact .",
    "when two smooth rigid bodies collide in a single point of their boundaries , the variation @xmath135 in the total kinetic energy during the impact can be expressed as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is newton s restitution coefficient and @xmath138 is the kinetic energy of the velocity differences , that is , the kinetic of the imaginary motion that would result from attributing to all the particles in the colliding bodies the velocities @xmath139 they lose in the impact . in other words , letting @xmath140 be the velocity of the @xmath141th particle before impact and @xmath142 that after impact , @xmath143 and @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the mass of the @xmath141th particle and the sum is extended to any discretization of of both colliding bodies .",
    "when a chain is described as a one - dimensional , inextensible string , as we did above , and a shock propagating though it is envisaged as a localized mass transfer with rate @xmath146 associated with the energy supply @xmath90 , directly suggests taking the rate of change of @xmath138 as @xmath147 so that the justifies , after setting @xmath148 in the following we shall not insist in representing the coefficient @xmath149 through in terms of the restitution coefficient for the impact of two chain s links . rather , we shall consider @xmath149 as a phenomenological coefficient pertaining only to the shape of the links in a chain and the material that constitutes them .",
    "of we shall only retain the bounds it imposes on @xmath149 , @xmath81 , . ] and we shall say that @xmath150 is the completely elastic limit , as there would be no dissipation at the shock , while @xmath151 is the completely inelastic limit , for which the dissipation at the shock would be maximum , for a given velocity jump @xmath79 .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath149 is a measurable parameter , and indeed it has been measured already , though perhaps inadvertently .      how chains have come to be associated with paradoxes is quite an interesting story , which here i only recount briefly .",
    "these _ paradoxes _ are indeed counter - intuitive predictions which some theories made and others did not support , which were sometimes sustained by experimental observations and sometimes were not .",
    "often it was considered paradoxical in this context relaxing an assumption mostly taken for granted and regarded as natural , but indeed unnecessary .",
    "the examples treated in the following are concerned with chains falling in one fashion or another in the terrestrial gravitational field . for them , for example",
    ", it might have been regarded as paradoxical a theory that predicted falling with an acceleration greater than the gravitational acceleration @xmath152 , not to mention the possibility that in the continuum limit either the velocity or the acceleration became unbounded during the motion .",
    "specifically , these are the problems we shall treat here ( and certainly , not for the first time ) . problem ( a ) , or the problem of a _ falling chain _ : a chain initially kept at equilibrium over a smooth , rigid plane , is let go under the action of its own weight ; describe the motion of the chain while the links coming in contact with the supporting plane accumulate over it , and compute the total force impressed on it , that is , the _ dynamical weight _ of the chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chain_sketches](a ) .    problem ( b ) , or the problem of a _ folded chain _ : a chain is initially held in a u - shaped configuration , with one arm ending in a fixed point and the other free to fall under its own weight ; describe the motion until when the chain is fully stretched vertically and compute the dynamical weight of the chain , see fig .  [",
    "fig : chain_sketches](b ) .",
    "problem ( c ) , or the problem of a _ sliding chain _ : a chain is supported by a smooth , rigid plane and leaves it though a hole under the action of gravity ; describe the motion of the chain hanging vertically below the plane and compute the dynamical weight of the chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chain_sketches](c ) .",
    "it is hard to say which of these problems is the oldest .",
    "for example , a variant of problem ( a ) is treated in tait and steele s treatise  @xcite .",
    "here one end of a uniformly heavy chain hangs over a small , smooth pulley and the other end is coiled up on a table ; if the free arm of the chain preponderates the antagonistic arm is pulled upward and keeps removing links from the table ; if , on the contrary , the free arm is outweighed by the other arm , this problem becomes very similar to problem ( a ) .",
    "problem ( b ) is treated in love s book  @xcite ; here the free chain s arm is supposed to fall with acceleration @xmath152 and the jump in tension at the tight chain s bight is derived from the localized balance of linear momentum .",
    "problem ( c ) featured in both jean s @xcite and love s @xcite treatises , which arrive at the same equation of motion obtained by cayley  @xcite from his general variational principle for the motion of systems whose mass grows by continuously taking into `` connextion '' ( in cayley s own language ) the contents of a quiescent reservoir .",
    "the solution method suggested by those textbooks was based on the balance of linear momentum , and no mention was made there of cayley s principle , though both methods produced one and the same equation of motion when applied to problem ( c ) .    in solving both problems ( b ) and ( c ) , love s approach , unlike others ,",
    "requires computing the tension within the chain .",
    "moreover , also in view of our further development , i found very illuminating the following sentence from love s book @xcite : `` it is important to observe that discontinuous motions such as are considered here in general involve dissipation of energy . ''      before discussing the details of the solutions to problems ( a)-(c ) afforded by the theory proposed in this paper , also to place them in a clearer perspective , i summarize below some other , newer approaches to these problems , some perhaps more convincing than others .",
    "one popular solution to problem ( a ) assumes that the chain s links fall with acceleration @xmath152 and computes the force that they exert on the supporting plane by balancing the linear momentum when they come abruptly at rest @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that at each instant in time the dynamical weight of the chain is three times the static weight of the chain collected on the plane up to then .",
    "this solution was already common knowledge by the early 1950s @xcite and also received some experimental confirmation , mixed with the voicing of some concerns as to the validity of the assumption that the chain falls with acceleration @xmath152 , or _",
    "freely _ , as one might also say @xcite .",
    "it was indeed shown experimentally by hamm and gminard  @xcite that a chain does _ not _ fall freely on a supporting plane , but with an acceleration _ greater _ than @xmath152 .",
    "this naturally led then to envision the existence of a dynamical force pulling the chain down , which can only be exerted by the solid surface on which the chain is accumulating , and for which an explicit representation was also proposed , based on a model for the growth of the accumulating coil @xcite . as remarked in @xcite ,",
    "this force is for all intents and purposes a _ tension _ exerted by the supporting surface , pulling downward the falling chain . as a result ,",
    "the dynamical weight of the chain now exceeds three times the static weight of the accumulated chain ( even dramatically so , as the experimental figures on @xcite suggest that it is nearly 6 times the total static weight of the chain at the time immediately preceding its complete deposition ) . in section  [ sec : falling ] below , we shall make a more definite contact with both this study and that of grewal , johnson and ruina  @xcite , which are equally central to our development .    problem ( b ) is perhaps the most controversial of the three considered here .",
    "if , as we learned above , love  @xcite assumed that the chain s arm with a free end falls freely , hamel  @xcite , as before him had done kucharski  @xcite , rejected this assumption and based instead the solution of the problem of the folded chain on the conservation of the total mechanical energy .",
    "this latter implies that the velocity of the falling arm increases indefinitely as the chain approaches the fully stretched configuration . this can be easily understood by realizing that conservation of energy requires a finite amount of potential energy to be transferred to a moving chain fragment whose mass decreases to nought as the chain straightens to its full length .",
    "direct inspection of the equation of motion derived from the energy conservation shows that also the acceleration diverges in the same limit , and so the chain is bound to fall faster than in a free fall .",
    "again a positive tension , @xmath153 , applied to the falling arm at the chain s bight must be responsible for such a faster fall .",
    "it was realized in @xcite that conservation of energy actually requires that @xmath153 equals the tension , @xmath154 , acting at the bight on the resting arm .",
    "as also pointed out in @xcite , different _ constitutive _ choices for these tensions would grant a full host of evolutions for the folded chain , including the one where the free arm falls freely @xcite . the problem , however , is that we are not at liberty of choosing constitutive laws for @xmath153 and @xmath154 , at least as long as we model chains as _ inextensible _ strings , for which the tension in an internal _ reactive _ force to be determined .",
    "we shall show in section  [ sec : folded ] how this task can be accomplished within our theory .",
    "the chain problems treated here have been selected with the purpose of proving that , treated in the appropriate continuum theory , they are free from any paradox .",
    "studies that treat the problem of a folded chain with the methods and language appropriate to a discrete systems have also been pursued ; among these , two in particular deserve notice @xcite .    in the classical solution of problem ( c ) ,",
    "when the chain starts sliding downward from rest and zero dangling length , the motion is predicted to take place with uniform acceleration @xmath155 . although nothing would of course be paradoxical with such a prediction , echoing love  @xcite , sommerfeld  @xcite remarked that in the corresponding motion the total mechanical energy is not conserved and made carnot s energy loss mechanism responsible for this @xcite .",
    "such a conclusion was rejected in @xcite and @xcite in favour of a lagrangean theory that enforces energy conservation .",
    "thus , if not paradoxical , problem ( c ) has become at least controversial , even more so on account of the fact that a convincing explanation for the energy loss can be given in terms of the ( inelastic ) impacts suffered by the links continuously set in motion by the sliding chain .    in the following three sections we shall study the chain problems described in this section within the general theory proposed here",
    ". the only constitutive parameter will be @xmath149 in . whenever @xmath156 , the singular point which will be appropriately identified for the three problems , is the site of a dissipative internal shock .",
    "further sources of dissipation may arise from external shocks , if present ; for them expresses in this theory the analogue of what in sommerfeld s language @xcite is carnot s energy loss .",
