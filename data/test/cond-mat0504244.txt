    "bilayer manganites such as , the @xmath1 member of the ruddelsden - popper series @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are rare - earth and alkaline - earth ions respectively ) , show @xcite a distinct lack of symmetry in the nature of their ground states across @xmath0 just as their 3d counterparts .",
    "these systems have started drawing attention after colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) has been reported in them @xcite .",
    "these layered systems not only show large magnetoresistance and a sequence of magnetic phases @xcite , they are very rich in their charge , magnetic and orbital structures .",
    "most of the studies in the bilayer system so far focussed on the mn@xmath5 richer region of @xmath6 .",
    "the mn@xmath7rich region ( @xmath8 ) is now explored carefully both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite and a succession of magnetic phases a@xmath9 c@xmath9 g has been confirmed .",
    "the situation very close to and around @xmath0 is somewhat poorly understood yet .",
    "it emerged recently that there is a coexistence between charge ordered and layered a - type spin ordered state @xcite there , giving way to the c - type ( or its polytype @xcite ) magnetic order at larger mn@xmath10 concentration .",
    "both a - type ( ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically ) and c - type ( ferromagnetic chains coupled antiferromagnetically ) phases have been found to be orbitally ordered .",
    "there are strong indications from several experimental groups that at and around @xmath0 , a charge ordered state coexists with an a - type antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "both neutron scattering @xcite and muon spin rotation corroborate this view .",
    "a discontinuity in the muon precession frequency at @xmath11 has been observed by coldea et al.@xcite .",
    "recently wilkins et al.,@xcite have reported that although there is clear evidence of both charge and orbital order in at @xmath0 , there is no detectable signature for any jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion in their resonant x - ray diffraction study .",
    "jt distortion of the mno@xmath12 octahedra begin to appear beyond @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there is , though , a reasonably large ( tetragonal ) static distortion - the crystallographic @xmath14 ratio reaches a minimum @xcite around the same composition , enhancing the af super - exchange along @xmath15 direction .",
    "this is expected to favour the a - type spin order in that region .",
    "unlike in the 3d manganites , there is no significant buckling of the bonds during distortion .",
    "it is now generally believed that the various magnetic structures owe their origin to a large degree to the underlying orbital order @xcite .",
    "models have been proposed @xcite for the manganites that incorporate the @xmath16 orbitals and the anisotropic hopping between them .",
    "the use of such models to the bilayer manganites ( like ) has only had limited success @xcite though , the a - phase is overestimated owing to the low dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "a much improved magnetic and orbital phase diagram was later obtained @xcite from a model that included the jt distortion as well as the proper choice of orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the a - type afm instability is indeed quite strong in the layered system @xcite , extending from @xmath17 to 0.66 and at low temperatures .",
    "the fm region of the phase diagram of some of the 3d manganites around @xmath0 is absent here , taken over by the a - type afm phase .",
    "having only two layers separated by large distance from the adjoining bilayer in the c - direction impedes a long range charge transport in that direction leading to stronger af correlations along c - direction thereby contributing to an enhanced a - type instability . beyond @xmath18 ,",
    "it is replaced by the c - type ( and its polytype ) order .",
    "the a- and c - phases are orbitally ordered and there is a connection between the preferred orbital order and the observed magnetic order .",
    "however , the presence of charge order and its relation to the underlying magnetic phases have not been investigated in any of the previous theoretical studies @xcite in bilayer systems .",
    "the question of charge order and possible phase separation in the overdoped bilayer systems , therefore , still remains an open issue with increasing evidence in favour of such coexistence coming from the experiments .",
    "we attempt to address it in the following , starting from a model that incorporates the essential physical attributes of this region .",
    "a quite general model for the bilayer manganites has been used @xcite to delineate the different orbital and magnetic structures for @xmath8 .",
    "it incorporates the degenerate manifold and the physics of double exchange ( de ) along with electron - electron interactions .",
    "this model can be adapted to investigate the charge order by including a longer range coulomb term in the interaction part .",
    "such a term has been known @xcite to give rise to coexisting charge ordered state in the 3d manganites at @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath19    as usual the charge and spin dynamics of the conventional de model@xcite operate here too , with additional degrees of freedom coming from the degenerate orbitals ( @xmath20 stand for the orbitals ) and hopping across them , which is determined by their symmetry . in the reasonably large hund",
    "s coupling limit , which is relevant for the studies on manganites , the de mechanism implies that an electron can hop onto a site if core spins at that site ( as well as the spin of any electron there ) are parallel to its spin .",
    "mobility reduces drastically with increasing j@xmath21 if they are antiparallel . in eqn.(1 ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the and spins at site @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the hund and super - exchange ( se ) coupling respectively .",
    "@xmath27 contains the on - site inter - orbital and the near - neighbour coulomb repulsion term .",
    "the intra - orbital term can be ignored as @xmath25 in manganites is fairly large , preventing double occupancy in any given mn 3d orbital@xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction between two bilayers is known to be at least a 100 times weaker @xcite than the intra - bilayer exchange .",
    "two bilayers are also well - separated in an unit cell and intervened by the rare - earth ions .",
    "one can , therefore , use only one bilayer for a reasonable description of the system@xcite . in general , in manganites , there is a strong jt coupling and that is included in the hamiltonian . as we mentioned above , in the bilayer systems ( e.g. in ) ,",
    "the jt coupling is weak and does not play a major role @xcite in the region @xmath28 . in the absence of electron - lattice coupling ,",
    "the kinetic energy ( ke ) of electrons in the @xmath16 band and the hund s coupling between @xmath29 and @xmath16 spins compete with the antiferromagnetic se interaction leading to a variety of magnetic and orbital structures .",
    "considering that there are two @xmath16 orbitals , the nominal band filling is @xmath30 .",
    "typical values of the interaction and band parameters for the bilayer systems are in the same range as in the 3d manganites . as in their 3d counterparts ,",
    "the hund coupling and coulomb correlations are the largest scale of energy @xcite in the problem .",
    "we neglect the inter - orbital coulomb term in the following discussion of charge order .",
    "the inter - orbital coulomb term does not have strong effect in the doping range @xmath31 less than or around 0.5 primarily because of the low filling ( @xmath32 ) making two orbitals at the same site less likely to be occupied simultaneously . as we see below",
    ", the magnetic order also prefers preferential occupancies in one of the two orbitals in both a- and c - phases and the @xmath33 term only enhances that ( discussed later ) .",
    "treating the t@xmath34 spins semiclassically @xcite , the se contribution to the ground state energy becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the angle between the near - neighbour spins in the @xmath38 plane and @xmath39 direction respectively . in the ferromagnetic state ,",
    "@xmath40 while in the a - phase @xmath41 and @xmath42    in the limit of infinite j@xmath21 , the electron quantization axes at each site @xmath24 is rotated in the local coordinate frame to make it parallel to @xmath43 .",
    "this is accomplished quite easily by the spin-1/2 rotation matrix @xmath44 operating on a two component spinor .",
    "allowing the core spins at each site to ca nt in the @xmath45plane and neglecting the phase term ( the berry phase ) appearing from the transformation , it is straightfoward to show @xcite that the effective hopping matrix elements are @xmath46 and @xmath47 in this level of approximation , the diagonalisation of the ke part of @xmath48 reduces to solving the @xmath49 matrix equation @xmath50 for a system of spinless fermions .",
    "the matrix elements are obtained from the standard table of the overlap integrals @xcite involving @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals on neighbouring sites of a square lattice and the dispersions are    @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    using the form of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath58 in the j@xmath59 approximation , the two energy bands are obtained by the diagonalization of the above matrix . in the uncanted a- and c - phases , the dispersions for a- and c - phases become two- and one - dimensional respectively . in the pure fm phase ,",
    "the dos is three dimensional .",
    "however , in the bilayer system , owing to the absence of dispersion in the @xmath39 direction , the dos in both fm and a phases show two dimensional character as shown in fig .",
    "there being only two @xmath60points in the @xmath61direction , the dos for the c - phase has two delta functions centred at @xmath62 .",
    "in all the calculations that follow , all energies are measured in terms of the overlap between the @xmath63 orbitals along @xmath61direction @xmath64 , which has a typical value about 0.25ev in manganites .",
    "in order to look for charge ordering in the bilayer manganites , we treat the nearest neighbour coulomb interaction @xmath65 in the mean field approximation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the charge order parameter and @xmath68 is the average number of electrons per site . we take the usual staggered ordering @xmath69 .",
    "the charge order parameter @xmath67 is then calculated self - consistently .",
    "the mean - field approximation is known to work quite well @xcite for the ground state properties in the manganites . in the infinite @xmath25 limit ,",
    "the electronic part of the hamiltonian is a @xmath70 matrix @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 represents the locally rotated electron operators described earlier ) and this is diagonalized at each of the @xmath73 points on a momentum grid .",
    "the bands obtained thereof are filled upto a chemical potential and the order parameter @xmath74 ( @xmath39 is the number of nearest neighbour ) calculated along with the filling .",
    "the process is repeated until self - consistency is achieved as is customary in the mean - field theory .",
    "charge order is indeed observed in a region @xmath75 when @xmath76 reaches a critical value , similar to the 3d manganites@xcite .",
    "but unlike in the 3d case , we do not observe any f - phase coexisting with the co in this region .",
    "as reported in previous work @xcite a - phase instability is quite strong in the layered manganites owing to the 2d structure of its dos and even for @xmath77 , there is no f - phase for @xmath78@xcite .",
    "the a - co coexistence region extends in a region above @xmath0 ( discussed later ) . in this limit of infinite @xmath25 ,",
    "the value of @xmath76 for which the co phase appears depends strongly on the canting angle @xmath58 away from the a - phase ( towards an f - phase ) . in fig . 2",
    "is shown the the dependence of the co order parameter on @xmath76 at three different angles ( @xmath79 being the pure a - phase ) .",
    "the inset shows how @xmath67 varies with canting at a typical @xmath80 in the infinite hund s coupling limit , the only way an electron gains ke in and af configuration of background spins is via the canting of them@xcite , thereby generating an effective non - zero hopping across .",
    "this has been observed@xcite in the 3d manganites as well close to its g - c phase boundary ( for @xmath81 ) . as we observe here",
    ", a co phase does not coexist with an f phase ( which is energetically unfavourable to an a - phase in this region ) and therefore the increased canting requires larger @xmath76 to bring about the charge ordering . at a fixed @xmath76 , therefore ,",
    "the co order parameter reduces with increased canting away from a - phase .",
    "the appropriate limit for any of the manganites is , of course , a large but finite value of the hund s coupling as is generally believed . in this limit",
    ", we can treat the core spins semi - classically again and the spin degrees of freedom for the @xmath16 electrons are reintroduced . in order to take care of this , the second term in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) would have to be treated now in various possible ground states .",
    "we choose @xmath82 to represent a homogeneous spin configuration , where @xmath83 determines different spin arrangements for the @xmath29 spins @xcite .",
    "the second term in eqn.(1 ) becomes @xmath84 the near - neighbour coulomb term is treated in the mean - field as above . in this semi - classical approximation for",
    "the @xmath29 spins the hamiltonian ( 1 ) reduces , then , to a @xmath85 matrix@xcite at each @xmath73 point .",
    "this mean - field hamiltonian is again diagonalised at each * k*-point on the momentum grid .",
    "the ground state energy is calculated for different magnetic structures .",
    "the co order parameter is also determined self - consistently .",
    "four different magnetic structures are relevant for the experimental phase diagram ( with q values in the parentheses ) , a - type ( @xmath86 ) , c - type ( @xmath87 ) - the usual c - phase with fm chains along c - direction , and the 3d afm g - type ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "there is also the c@xmath89-type polytype structure @xcite , with @xmath90 this is same as a c - type , only that its fm ordering is along y - direction as reported by ling et al .",
    "the magnetic structure with minimum ground state energy and the co order parameter are determined for each set of parameters ( @xmath31 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) for the range of doping ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "charge order is observed in the region @xmath92 .",
    "3 shows the co order parameter as a function of @xmath76 for @xmath0 . the underlying spin order in this region",
    "is found to be a - type and there is a a - co to a transition at around @xmath93 for @xmath80 there is a jump in the co order parameter as a function of @xmath31 , shown in fig .",
    "4 , indicating a first order transition .",
    "the coexistence region of co and a is a manifestation of this first order transition .",
    "based on the observed variation of these different charge and spin ordered states , we obtained a phase diagram in the @xmath94 plane for @xmath95 .    the observed phase diagram , shown in fig .",
    "5 , is markedly similar to the one obtained by ling and coworkers .",
    "in addition it also has the charge ordered phase coexisting with the a - phase in the region close to @xmath0 .",
    "as reported by coldea et al.,@xcite , there is indeed a region of a - co coexistence between @xmath0 and @xmath96 .",
    "we note that we have also tried a charge order with wave vector @xmath97 instead of the fully staggered one and observed that energetically it is very close to the staggered one .",
    "this is primarily due to the absence of coherent charge transport in the c - direction making a charge uniform state in that direction nearly degenerate with a charge ordered one .",
    "we note in passing that we did not observe the well known ce phase@xcite in our calculation even at @xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the findings in the @xmath77 case studied earlier@xcite .",
    "the region of no long range order just above the a - co coexistence reported by both ling et al . and coldea et al .",
    "is beyond the scope of the treatments here .",
    "it is at this point useful to note that a region of two phase coexistence is not very stable against long range coulomb interactions and in real systems one would probably observe a microscopically phase separated mixture of one phase in another .",
    "the region of no lro could well be such a region , around the a - co to a transition and with the competing c@xmath89 phase energetically very close by .    in the absence of co the phases",
    "a and c@xmath89 are both orbitally ordered @xcite and we look for this in the presence of the near - neighbour coulomb term also .",
    "we do indeed find very similar orbital occupancies here too .",
    "there is a predominant occupancy in the @xmath63 orbital over the @xmath98 orbital indicating orbital ordering .",
    "the occupancies in the two orbitals must add up to the total electron density ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the effect of charge ordering is seen to be small , shown in fig .",
    "6 , reducing the orbital order ( measured by the imbalance in the orbital occupancies ) in the a - co phase from its value in the absence of co. there is no effect in orbital occupancies at the a - co to a boundary , they smoothly continue into the pure a - phase .",
    "the presence of orbital order here is not contingent upon the underlying lattice distortion or jt effects .",
    "this conforms to the recent observation of wilkins et al.@xcite that even without any jt distortion , there is a pronounced orbital order . in the region of c@xmath89-phase ,",
    "the orbital order is identical ( predominantly @xmath99 over @xmath100 ) to the one reported earlier@xcite for the undistorted bilayer system and are not shown here .",
    "we have looked into the effect of an inter - orbital repulsion term on the phase diagram and charge ordering and except for a slight enhancement of the orbital order , found it to have little effect on the phase diagram .",
    "the intra - orbital coulomb term is known to have very little effect@xcite in the mean - field theory in the region of large j@xmath21 and we havent considered it in the above .",
    "motivated by the observation of charge ordering in the region @xmath101 in the bilayer systems , we have investigated it from a model that has been quite useful in understanding the overdoped manganites .",
    "the charge order has been found in our calculation in the same region where it has been seen experimentally .",
    "there is also a region of phase separation abutting the experimentally observed no lro region .",
    "we observe orbital order even in the absence of jt distortion as reported recently in the same region of doping",
    ". it would be interesting to see more experiments on the region of no lro in the phase diagram .",
    "the possibility of canting of spins is yet not ruled out and we have seen trends for it for very large hund s coupling in our calculations .      999 c. d. ling et al .",
