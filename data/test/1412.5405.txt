    "after several decades during which the study of systems of many interacting particles has focused on matter fluids such as liquid helium , electron gases in solid - state materials , ultracold atom vapors , nuclear - matter fluids , or quark - gluon plasmas in colliders , photon propagation in suitably designed nonlinear optical systems is presently attracting a growing interest as a novel platform to investigate the physics of interacting bose gases , the so - called _ quantum fluids of light _ ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the interactions between the photons constituting the fluid of light are mediated by the kerr ( @xmath0 ) optical nonlinearity of the underlying medium .",
    "so far , numerous experimental observations have been performed for semiconductor - planar - microcavity geometries , including the demonstration of a bose - einstein - like condensation @xcite , of a superfluid flow @xcite , and of the hydrodynamic nucleation of nonlinear excitations such as solitons @xcite and quantized vortices @xcite in dilute photon gases . in the meanwhile",
    ", active investigations have addressed the possibility of realizing systems characterized by very large optical nonlinearities .",
    "correspondingly , the induced photon - photon interactions are expected to introduce strong quantum correlations within the fluid of light , generating in turn new quantum phases .    in this quest @xcite , researchers have been faced to ( at least ) two main difficulties . on the one hand , obtaining strong enough nonlinearities in scalable systems to study the dynamics of a strongly interacting photon gas in a spatially extended system turns out to be a major experimental challenge . on the other hand , the dynamics of a light field in devices based on cavities",
    "is intrinsically a driven - dissipative one , which introduces severe complications in the theoretical description of such systems and which is typically very detrimental for the study of purely quantum features .",
    "an alternative platform for studying many - body physics in photon fluids is based on light propagating in a bulk nonlinear ( of kerr type ) optical medium . from elementary classical optics",
    ", it is well known that the paraxial propagation of a spectrally narrow beam of light can be described within the so - called paraxial and slowly - varying - envelope approximations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) by a nonlinear wave equation formally analogous to the gross - pitaevskii equation for the order parameter of a dilute bose - einstein condensate @xcite . as originally pioneered in refs .",
    "@xcite , this framework naturally translates upon quantization to a many - body quantum nonlinear schrdinger formalism with the roles of the propagation coordinate and time exchanged .",
    "this framework has been used in a number of theoretical works where laser - physics problems have been reformulated in the hydrodynamics language @xcite , including , e.g. , the investigation of superfluid - like behaviors in the flow of a photon fluid @xcite , of nonlinear phenomena with light waves @xcite , and of the so - called acoustic hawking radiation @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", numerous works have been devoted to the study of nonlinear features that may appear in these systems , with a special attention dedicated to their relation to hydrodynamics and superfluidity aspects @xcite .",
    "a major first step in the very quantum direction of realizing a gas of strongly interacting photons in a propagating geometry has been recently reported using an optically dressed atom gas in the rydberg - eit regime as a bulk nonlinear medium : this has allowed for the experimental observation of strongly repulsing photons @xcite and , soon after , of two - photon molecular bound states @xcite .",
    "these remarkable experimental advances call for a theoretical approach that is able to describe in its full generality the many - body dynamics of strongly interacting photons propagating in a cavityless configuration .    building atop the pioneering theoretical works @xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , we report here a fully general quantum field theory of the propagating photon fluid . in this approach , the roles played by the optical - axis coordinate @xmath1 and the time parameter @xmath2 are exchanged : light propagation in the @xmath1 direction is naturally described in terms of evolution equations while the @xmath2 direction corresponds to a third spatial dimension in addition to the transverse @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions . in a paraxial - propagation configuration , light diffraction provides an effective mass to the photons in the @xmath5 plane and chromatic dispersion leads to a  typically different  effective mass in the @xmath2 direction . as usual",
    ", the kerr nonlinearity of the medium gives rise to photon - photon interactions .",
    "in contrast to microcavity configurations where driving and dissipation play a major role in the photon - fluid dynamics @xcite , in paraxial - propagation geometries , the quantum fluid of light follows a fully conservative hamilton dynamics starting from an initial condition determined by the incident light field and its coherence properties .",
    "the quantum state of the optical field at the end of the evolution is experimentally accessible _ via _ a measurement of the statistical properties of the transmitted light emerging from the nonlinear optical medium .    as a most remarkable example of application of this formalism",
    ", we then study the transmission of a coherent light across a finite slab of weakly nonlinear medium .",
    "in this very simple configuration , the photons experience a pair of sudden jumps of the interaction parameter upon crossing the front and the back faces of the nonlinear medium . as a result of these two _ quantum quenches _ , the fluid of light gets excited and its quantum state after the conservative evolution across the nonlinear material can be reconstructed from the statistical properties of the transmitted light . in the weak - nonlinearity regime , the main excitation process consists in the emission of pairs of correlated counterpropagating bogoliubov phonons , which reflects in peculiar features in the intensity distribution and in the near- and the far - field two - body correlation functions . in its simplicity , this example illustrates the power of the conservative propagation dynamics in view of generating , detecting , and manipulating strongly correlated quantum phases of matter in photon gases , as well as of studying quantum dynamical features of many - body systems @xcite .",

    "we finally suppose that the optical field maintains its polarization in the course of its propagation in the medium so that a scalar approach is valid . as explained , e.g. , in ref .",

    "the first and second derivatives of the envelope @xmath33 with respect to @xmath2 vanish , in such a way that the propagation of the optical field decribed by eq .",
    "recovers the mean - field dynamics of the order parameter of a dilute two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate , @xmath34 playing the role of some external potential and @xmath35 corresponding to the effective two - dimensional boson - boson interaction constant .",
    "on the other hand , only a very few studies so far @xcite have investigated the consequences of this analogy in time - dependent regimes , where , by extension , the propagation of the photon fluid in the positive-@xmath1 direction can be written in terms of a time evolution in a three - dimensional @xmath36 space where the physical time parameter @xmath2 plays the role of a third spatial coordinate in addition to the transverse variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the following , a special attention will be paid to the new hydrodynamic features that originate from this @xmath2 dependence .    in order to facilitate @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) to be viewed as a true time ( space ) parameter",
    ", we introduce the following coordinates : @xmath37 respectively homogeneous to a time and a length . in these new variables ,",

    "this @xmath43 dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath41 corresponds in our language to a temporal dependence , which , as we shall see in the following , opens the way to the study of quantum - quench physics in the framework of paraxial optics . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the medium properties do not depend on the physical time @xmath2 implies that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are independent on the spatial @xmath44 coordinate .    in the gross - pitaevskii - like equation , the rigid - drift ( in the @xmath45 direction )",
    "term @xmath46 originates from the group velocity of the photons in the medium and the kinetic operator @xmath47 involves a contribution in the ( actual - time ) @xmath45 direction in addition to the usual one in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "the anisotropy of the `` mass '' tensor @xmath48 in eq .   is a natural consequence of the different origins of the effective masses @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the ( spatial ) @xmath3 , @xmath4 directions and @xmath51 in the ( temporal ) @xmath44 one : the former are due to diffraction while the latter originates from dispersion ; note that in vacuum , @xmath52 and so @xmath51 is infinite , by definition .    when the medium is characterized by an anomalous group - velocity dispersion , that is , when @xmath53 , one has @xmath54 and so the mass matrix @xmath55 is positive in all the directions . in the following ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bogoliubovtheoryofquantumfluctuations ] for a detailed discussion ) , we shall see that the dynamical stability of the fluid of light requires such a negative @xmath56 , but also repulsive photon - photon interactions , which sets @xmath57 and therefore @xmath58 , that is , that the kerr nonlinearity is self - defocusing .",
    "in order to describe the quantum features of a light beam propagating in the nonlinear medium considered in sec .  [ sec : classicalwaveequation ] , the classical photon field @xmath59 verifying the paraxial wave equation must be replaced with a quantum field operator satisfying suitable boson commutation relations . to this purpose , in the present work",

    "@xcite ) and applied to concrete problems related to quantum soliton propagation @xcite : as a crucial addition to these works , we do not restrict our attention to one - dimensional fiber geometries for which only the @xmath45 coordinate matters @xcite , but fully take into account the dynamics of the optical field in the transverse @xmath5 plane .",
    "furthermore , an explicit expression for the normalization constant appearing in the boson commutators is provided .",
    "in contrast to works on the quantization of paraxial electromagnetic fields @xcite , our approach is able to naturally describe spatiotemporal light propagation and to include the possible existence of spatial inhomogeneities and/or of an optical confinement as well as of an optical nonlinearity . as we shall see later",
