    "by its name , a waveguide serves for propagating waves which may be of different physical origins : fluctuations of pressure in acoustics , electromagnetic waves in optics , particle waves in quantum mechanics , surface water waves in hydrodynamics , etc .",
    "the transmission properties of a waveguide can be characterized by its resonance frequencies or , equivalently , by the spectrum of an operator which describes the waves motion ( e.g. , the laplace operator in the most usual case ) . for infinite waveguides ,",
    "the spectrum consists of two parts : ( i ) the essential ( or continuous ) spectrum for which the related resonances are extended over the whole domain and thus have infinite @xmath0 norms , and ( ii ) the discrete ( or point - like ) spectrum for which the related eigenfunctions have finite @xmath0 norms and thus necessarily `` trapped '' or `` localized '' in a region of the waveguide . a wave excited at the frequency of the trapped eigenmode remains in the localization region and does not propagate .    the existence of trapped , bound or localized eigenmodes in classical and quantum waveguides has been thoroughly investigated ( see reviews @xcite and also references in @xcite ) . in the seminal paper ,",
    "rellich proved the existence of a localized eigenfunction in a deformed infinite cylinder @xcite .",
    "his results were significantly extended by jones @xcite .",
    "ursell reported on the existence of trapped modes in surface water waves in channels @xcite , while parker observed experimentally the trapped modes in locally perturbed acoustic waveguides @xcite .",
    "exner and seba considered an infinite bent strip of smooth curvature and showed the existence of trapped modes by reducing the problem to schrdinger operator in the straight strip , with the potential depending on the curvature @xcite .",
    "goldstone and jaffe gave the variational proof that the wave equation subject to dirichlet boundary condition always has a localized eigenmode in an infinite tube of constant cross - section in any dimension , provided that the tube is not exactly straight @xcite .",
    "the problem of localization in acoustic waveguides with neumann boundary condition has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "for instance , evans _",
    "considered a straight strip with an inclusion of arbitrary ( but symmetric ) shape @xcite ( see @xcite for further extension ) .",
    "such an inclusion obstructed the propagation of waves and was shown to result in trapped modes .",
    "the effect of mixed dirichlet , neumann and robin boundary conditions on the localization was also investigated ( see @xcite and references therein ) . a mathematical analysis of guided water waves was developed in @xcite .",
    "all the aforementioned works dealt with infinite waveguides for which the laplace operator spectrum is essential , with possible inclusion of discrete points . since these discrete points were responsible for trapped modes , the major question was whether or not such discrete points exist below the essential spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting that the localized modes have to decay relatively fast at infinity in order to guarantee the finite @xmath0 norm .",
    "but the same question about the existence of rapidly decaying eigenfunctions may be formulated for bounded domains ( resonators ) with long branches that we call `` finite waveguides '' ( fig . [ fig : domain ] ) .",
    "this problem is different in many aspects . since all eigenfunctions have now finite @xmath0 norms , the definition of trapped or localized modes has to be revised .",
    "quite surprisingly , a rigorous definition of localization in bounded domains turns out to be a challenging problem @xcite . in the context of the present paper concerning finite waveguides ,",
    "an eigenmode is called trapped or localized if it decays exponentially fast in prominent subregions ( branches ) of the bounded domain .",
    "the exponential decay of an eigenfunction in the branch can be related to the smallness of the associated eigenvalue in comparison to the cut - off frequency , i.e. the first eigenvalue of the laplace operator in the cross - section of that branch @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the existence of a trapped mode is related to `` smallness '' of the eigenvalue , in full analogy to infinite waveguides . using the standard mathematical tools such as domain decomposition , explicit representation of solutions of the helmholtz equation and variational principle",
    ", we aim at formalizing these ideas and providing a sufficient condition on the branch lengths for getting a trapped mode .",
    "the dependence of the localization character on the length of branches is the main result of the paper and a new feature of finite waveguides which was overseen in the well - established theory of infinite waveguides . as in practice",
    "all quantum waveguides are finite , this dependence may be important for microelectronic devices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : main ] , we adapt the method by bonnet - ben dhia and joly @xcite in order to reduce the original eigenvalue problem in the whole domain to the nonlinear eigenvalue problem in the domain without branches .",
    "although the new problem is more sophisticated , its variational reformulation provides a general framework for proving the trapping ( or localization ) of eigenfunctions .",
    "we use it to derive the main result of the paper : a sufficient condition ( [ eq : cond_general ] ) on the branch lengths for getting a trapped mode .",
    "in sharp contrast to an infinite ( non - straight ) waveguide of a constant cross - section , for which the first eigenfunction is always trapped and exponentially decaying @xcite , finite waveguides may _ or may not _ have such an eigenfunction , depending on the length of branches .",
    "this method is then illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] for several finite waveguides ( e.g. , a bent strip and a cross of two stripes ) . for these examples",
    ", we estimate the minimal branch length which is sufficient for getting at least one localized mode . at the same time , we provide an example of a waveguide , for which there is no localization for any branch length .",
    "we also construct a family of finite waveguides for which the minimal branch length varies continuously . as a consequence , for",
    "a given ( large enough ) branch length , one can construct two almost identical resonators , one with and the other without localized mode .",
    "this observation may be used for developing quantum switching devices .",
