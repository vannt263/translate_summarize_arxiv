    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have attracted considerable interest worldwide ever since their discovery in 1991  @xcite , mainly because of their unusual properties and great potentials for technological applications .",
    "cnts can be regarded as a layer of graphene sheet rolled up in a tubular form  @xcite , and the structure of a cnt is specified by a chiral vector defined by a pair of integers ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "cnts can be chiral or nonchiral depending on the way they are rolled up .",
    "their physical properties , in particular , optical dielectric functions , depend sensitively on their chirality , i.e. , the ( @xmath5 ) indices ( see , e.g. , refs . and and references therein ) .",
    "apart from cnts , inorganic tubular materials , such as bn  @xcite , aln  @xcite , gan  @xcite , have also been predicted and synthesized .",
    "these tubular materials also display some very interesting properties distinctly different from their bulks .",
    "bulk silicon carbide ( sic ) crystallizes in either a cubic or a hexagonal form , and exbihits polytypism  @xcite .",
    "the polytypes are made of identical hexagonal layers with different stacking sequences .",
    "these polytypes are semiconductors with a range of band gaps , from 2.39 ev in the zincblende ( 3c ) to 3.33 ev in the wurtzite polytype ( 2h )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 3c- and 6h - sic are used for high temperature , high - power and high - frequency devices  @xcite due to their unique properties  @xcite , while 6h - sic with a band gap of 2.86 ev is a useful material for blue light - emitting diode applications  @xcite . recently",
    ", sic - nts were also synthesized by the reaction of cnts and sio at different temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated a number of theoretical and experimental investigations on the tubular form of the sic  @xcite .",
    "based on density - functional calculations , miyamoto and yu  @xcite predicted the existence of graphitic and tubular forms of sic and also proposed their synthesis using an extreme hole injection technique .",
    "they also reported that the strain energies of sic - nts are lower than that of cnts , and that the band gaps of sic - nts can be direct or indirect , depending on the chirality . using both tight - binding molecular dynamics and @xmath6 methods , menon and coworkers",
    "@xcite showed that single - walled sic - nts are highly stable with a large band gap .",
    "zhao @xmath7",
    "@xcite also investigated theoretically the strain energy , atomic and electronic structure of sic - nts with or without hydrogenation .",
    "gali performed an _ ab initio _ study of the effect of nitrogen and boron impurities on the band structure of the sic - nts  @xcite .    unlike cnts ,",
    "sic - nts are polar materials and therefore , may exhibit some unusual physical properties that cnts may not have .",
    "for example , like bn - nts,@xcite zigzag sic - nts may become piezoelectric , and also show second - order non - linear optical response . despite the intensive theoretical studies mentioned above , no @xmath6 calculation of the dielectric response and optical properties of sic - nts has been reported , perhaps because of the heavy demand on computer resources .",
    "a knowledge of the optical properties of sic - nts is important for their optical and electrooptical applications .",
    "therefore , we have recently carried out a series of _ ab initio _ calculations in order to analyze the linear optical features and underlying band structure of all three types of the sic - nts as well as their possible dependence on diameter and chirality.@xcite in this work , we investigate the second - order optical susceptibility and also linear electro - optical coefficient of the sic - nts as well as bulk sic polytypes . the primary objective of this work is to find out the features and magnitude of the second - harmonic generation and linear electro - optical coefficients of the sic - nts in order to see whether they have any potential applications in nonlinear optical and electro - optical devices such as second - harmonic generation , sum - frequency generation , and electrical optical switch .",
    "the second objective is to identify distinguished differences in nonlinear optical properties between sic - nts and cnts  @xcite , and also between sic - nts and bn - nts  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the theoretical approach and computational method are described . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility and linear electro - optical coefficients of sic nanotubes are presented . for comparison ,",
    "the second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility and linear electro - optical coefficients of bulk sic polytypes and single graphitic sic sheet are also calculated and presented . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , a summary is given .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations for the sic - nts were performed using highly accurate full - potential projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method  @xcite , as implemented in the vasp package  @xcite .",
    "they are based on density functional theory ( dft ) with the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "a supercell geometry was adopted so that the nanotubes are aligned in a square array with the closest distance between adjacent nanotubes being at least 10  .",
    "a large plane - wave energy cutoff of 450 ev was used throughout .",
    "we consider a large number of representative sic - nts with a range of diameters from all three types , as listed in ref . .",
    "first , the ideal nanotubes were constructed by rolling - up a hexagonal sic sheet . the atomic positions and lattice constants",
    "were then fully relaxed by the conjugate gradient technique .",
    "the theoretical equilibrium atomic positions and lattice constant were obtained when the forces acting on all the atoms and the uniaxial stress were less than 0.04 ev / @xmath8 and 1.0 kbar , respectively .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constants @xmath9 and curvature energies @xmath10 ( total energy relative to that of single sic sheet ) as well as the other computational details have been reported before  @xcite .",
    "the final self - consistent electronic band structure calculations were then carried out for the theoretically determined sic - nt structures . in this work ,",
    "the non - linear optical properties were calculated based on the independent - particle approximation , i.e. , the excitonic effects and the local - field corrections were neglected .",
    "note that the band gap of sic in the wurtzite ( 2h ) structure from our lda calculations is 2.12 ev ( see sec .",
    "iiia below ) , being 1.18 ev smaller than the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the quasi - particle self - energy corrections to the optical peak positions may amount to @xmath111 ev in the sic systems .",
    "furthermore , because the lda underestimates the energy gaps , the calculated dielectric function and second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility in the static limit might be slightly too large in general . for example , our calculated dielectric function at 0 ev for the electric field parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath12-axis of 2h - sic is 8.33 and 7.90 , respectively , being slightly larger than the corresponding measured @xmath13 , 6.84 and 6.51 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the results from the present lda - independent - particle calculations might not be able to be compared quantitatively with experiments , though they would certainly be useful to study the trends and characteristics of the optical properties of the sic - nts .",
    "nonetheless , our previous calculations show that the dielectric functions of graphite  @xcite and also of h - bn  @xcite calculated within the independent - particle picture are in reasonable agreement with experiments , perhaps because of the accidental cancellation of the self - energy corrections by the excitonic effects .    following previous nonlinear optical calculations  @xcite ,",
    "the imaginary part of the second - order optical susceptibility due to direction interband transitons is given by  @xcite @xmath14 where the contribution due to the so - called virtual - electron ( ve ) process is @xmath15}{\\epsilon^3_{li}(\\epsilon_{li}+   \\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{li}-\\omega ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\frac{im[p_{ij}^a\\langle p_{jl}^bp_{li}^c\\rangle]}{\\epsilon^3_{li}(2\\epsilon_{li}-",
    "\\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{li}-\\omega )     + \\frac{16im[p_{ij}^a\\langle p_{jl}^bp_{li}^c\\rangle]}{\\epsilon^3_{ji}(2\\epsilon_{li}-    \\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{ji}-2\\omega ) \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that due to the virtual - hole ( vh ) process @xmath16}{\\epsilon^3_{jl}(\\epsilon_{jl}+   \\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{jl}-\\omega ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\frac{im[p_{ij}^a\\langle p_{jl}^bp_{li}^c\\rangle]}{\\epsilon^3_{jl}(2\\epsilon_{jl}-",
    "\\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{jl}-\\omega )     + \\frac{16im[p_{ij}^a \\langle p_{jl}^bp_{li}^c\\rangle]}{\\epsilon^3_{ji}(2\\epsilon_{jl}-   \\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{ji}-2\\omega ) \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the dipole transition matrix elements @xmath19 were obtained from the self - consistent band structures within the paw formalism  @xcite .",
    "the real part of the second - order optical susceptibility is then obtained from @xmath20 by a kramer - kronig transformation @xmath21    the linear electro - optic coefficient @xmath22 is connected to the second - order optical susceptibility @xmath23 through the relation  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the refraction index in the @xmath26-direction . in the zero frequency limit , @xmath27 therefore , @xmath28 furthermore , for the photon energy @xmath29 well below the band gap , the linear electro - optic coefficient @xmath30 because @xmath31 and @xmath32 are nearly constant in this low frequency region , as shown in the next section and in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present calculations , the @xmath33-function in eqs .",
    "( 2)-(3 ) is approximated by a gaussian function with @xmath34 ev . a uniform @xmath35-point grid ( 1@xmath361@xmath36n ) along the nanotube axis ( @xmath37-axis ) with the number @xmath38 being from 40 to 100 ,",
    "furthermore , to ensure that @xmath39 calculated via kramer - kronig transformation ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) is reliable , at least ten energy bands per atom are included in the present optical calculations . the unit cell volume @xmath40 in eqs .",
    "( 2)-(3 ) is not well defined for nanotubes .",
    "therefore , like the previous calculations  @xcite , we used the effective unit cell volume of the nanotubes rather than the volume of the supercells which is arbitrary .",
    "the effective unit cell of a nanotube is given by @xmath41 t = \\pi ddt$ ] where @xmath42 is the thickness of the nanotube cylinder which is set to the interlayer distance of @xmath43-sic ( 3.51   @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath9 are the diameter and length of translational vector of the nanotube  @xcite , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we list in table iv the calculated zero frequency linear electro - optic coefficient @xmath45 as well as the corresponding second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility @xmath46 of the sic - nts .",
    "the @xmath45 is calculated from the corresponding @xmath46 by using eq .",
    "the refraction index @xmath47 is derived from the calculated static dielectric constant @xmath48 which has been reported in our recent publication  @xcite .",
    "table iv shows that apart from the ( 5,0 ) and ( 9,0 ) sic - nts which have no nonvanishing @xmath49 , and also the small diameter ( 6,0 ) and ( 8,0 ) sic - nts , all the other zigzag sic - nts have very similar linear electro - optical coefficients , as for the static dielectric constant and polarizability  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath50 decreases slightly as the diameter increases , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 increase slightly as the diameter goes up .",
    "remarkably , the static @xmath53 for the ultra - small diameter ( 6,0 ) is very large ( table iv ) , being nearly thirteen times larger than the largest component of @xmath54 of all the four bulk sic polytypes ( table ii ) .",
    "this suggests that the sic - nts would be useful for applications in the non - linear optical devices .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath53 decreases rapidly as the diamter of the zigzag sic - nts increases , and , for the large diamter ( 24,0 ) sic - nt , approaches the value of @xmath55 of the single sic sheet ( table ii ) .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath55 is about half of the magnitude of the @xmath53 for the ( 6,0 ) sic - nt .",
    "we note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are rather similar , and their magnitudes increase as their tube diameters increases .",
    "finally , for the larger diameter zigzag sic - nts , the @xmath53 is about two times larger than @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( table iv ) .",
    "the chiral sic - nts have two additional nonvanishing components @xmath58 and @xmath59 . nevertheless , the calculated static values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are negligibly small ( i.e. , within the numerical uncertainty ) , thereby satisfying the requirement by the so - called kleinman symmetry  @xcite which demands that @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding static linear electro - optical coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 are zero too .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the chiral sic - nts are not listed in table iv . as for the nonvanishing static components , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the ( 6,2 ) , ( 8,4 ) and ( 10,4 )",
    "sic - nts are quite close .",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath50 decrease as the tube diameter increases , while , in contrast , @xmath66 and @xmath52 increase with the tube diameter .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 for the ( 4,2 ) is somewhat smaller than that of the other chiral sic - nts .",
    "the zero frequency second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility @xmath46 of the sic - nts ( table iv ) are generally a few times larger than the counterparts of the corresponding bn - nts  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath67 of the ( 6,0 ) sic - nt is about thirteen times larger than that of the ( 6,0 ) bn - nt  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath67 of the ( 24,0 ) sic - nt is only about six times larger than that of the ( 24,0 ) bn - nt  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that compared with bn - nts , sic - nts would be a better nonlinear optical material .",
    "however , the low frequency linear electro - optic coefficient @xmath45 of the sic - nts ( table iv ) are only slightly larger than the counterparts of the corresponding bn - nts  @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath50 of the ( 6,0 ) and ( 24,0 ) sic - nts is , respectively , 1.7 and 1.3 times larger than that of the ( 6,0 ) and ( 24,0 ) bn - nts .",
    "this is because the refraction index @xmath38 of the sic - nts ( table iv ) are also larger than that of the bn - nts  @xcite [ see eq .",
    "we have carried out a systematic _ ab initio _ study of the second - order nonlinear optical properties of sic - nts within density functional theory in the local density approximation .",
    "we used the highly accurate full - potential paw method .",
    "the underlying atomic structure of the sic nanotubes was determined theoretically .",
    "specifically , the properties of the single - walled zigzag [ ( 5,0 ) , ( 6,0 ) , ( 8,0 ) , ( 9,0 ) , ( 12,0 ) , ( 16,0 ) , ( 20,0 ) , ( 24,0 ) ] , armchair [ ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) , ( 8,8 ) , ( 12,12 ) , ( 15,15 ) ] , and chiral [ ( 4,2 ) , ( 6,2 ) , ( 8,4 ) , ( 10,4 ) ] nanotubes have been calculated . for comparison ,",
    "the second - order nonlinear optical properties of bulk sic polytypes ( 2h- , 4h- , 6h- and 3c - sic ) and the single graphitic sic sheet have also been calculated .",
    "interestingly , we find that the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the isolated sic sheet are large and generally several times larger than that of the sic polytypes . unlike carbon nanotubes ,",
    "both the chiral and zigzag sic - nts have pronounced second - harmonic generation and linear electro - optical coefficients which are comparable to or even larger than that of the single sic sheet .",
    "the prominant structures in the spectra of @xmath71 of the sic - nts have been related to the features in the corresponding linear optical dielectric function @xmath3 in terms of single - photon and double - photon resonances .",
    "we also find that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 coefficients of the sic - nts are up to thirteen - times larger than the counterparts of the corresponding bn - nts .",
    "therefore , the sic - nts would be promising nonlinear optical materials for applications in , e.g. , second - harmonic generation , sum frequency generation and electro - optical switches .",
