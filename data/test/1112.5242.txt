    "the standard model ( sm ) has been the pillar of particle physics for many years . however ,",
    "there are some unsolved problems such as the origin of mass , the strong cp problem , neutrino oscillations , origins of dark matter and dark energy , number of generations , matter - antimatter asymmetry , quantum gravity , unification and so on which can not be explained by the sm . to cure such deficiencies , there exist various extensions of the standard model through supersymmetry , sm with fourth generation , etc . or entirely novel explanations , such as string theory , m - theory and extra dimensions .",
    "the new theories beyond the sm need to be confirmed in the experiments .",
    "hence , calculation of many parameters related to the decays of hadrons via new theories such as sm4 are important as they could be studied at particle colliders .",
    "it is expected that the lhc will provide possibility to study properties of hadrons as well as their electromagnetic , weak and strong decays . among these decays ,",
    "the weak decays of hadrons can play a crucial role in searching for physics beyond the sm . the loop level semileptonic weak transitions of the heavy baryons containing single heavy quark to light baryons induced by the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are useful tools in this respect . in this connection",
    ", we analyze the @xmath3 transition in sm4 by calculating various related parameters like branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry , baryon polarization as well as double lepton polarization asymmetries . here , we use all involved twelve form factors recently calculated in full qcd @xcite .",

    "the latter is described via a low energy effective hamiltonian containing wilson coefficients . in sm4 ,",

    "* when we consider only the central values of the form factors , except than the @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the remaining double lepton polarization asymmetries grow increasing the @xmath101 and value of the @xmath95 . for @xmath99 ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the maximum deviation belongs to the @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 and upper bound of the @xmath101 ) .",
    "we have performed a comprehensive analysis on the @xmath0 transition both in the sm4 and sm models . in particular , using the form factors entering the low energy matrix elements both from full qcd as well as hqet , we have investigated the branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry , double lepton polarization asymmetries and polarization of the @xmath107 baryon .",
    "we have observed that there are overall sizable differences between the predictions of the sm and sm4 on the considered physical quantities when @xmath108 .",
    "this can be considered as an indication of the existence of the fourth family quarks should we search for in the future experiments .",
    "the results also depicted overall considerable differences between the predictions of the full qcd and those of the hqet .",
    "the orders of the branching ratios in both lepton channels show that these decay channels can be detected at lhcb .",
    "any measurement on the considered physical quantities and their comparison with the theoretical predictions can give valuable information about both nature of the participating baryons and existence of the fourth family quarks .",
