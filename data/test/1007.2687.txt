    "the problem of full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite is often considered in a setup periodic in time.@xcite in such a formulation , the system depends on external parameters varying periodically in time , and one is interested in counting certain quantized events ( typically , the transfer of particles between the leads of a contact ) .",
    "generally , the probabilities of different outcomes @xmath0 are labeled by integer indices @xmath1 and can be combined into the probability generating function @xcite @xmath2 for a superposition of statistically independent processes , the generating function is given by the product of those for each process . therefore , for a periodic process extended in time , this generating function is exponentially extensive in time , provided the correlations in time decay sufficiently rapidly .",
    "one therefore usually defines the generating function `` per period '' @xcite ( or `` extensive '' fcs ) @xmath3\\ , ,   \\label{chi - extensive}\\ ] ] where the fcs @xmath4 is collected over @xmath5 periods .",
    "a vast literature is devoted to fcs both in the general setup and for periodic processes.@xcite probably , the most interesting class of fcs problems are those of quantum charge transfer,@xcite but there are also discussions of fcs in classical stochastic processes ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and of the relation between classical and quantum effects in fcs ( see , e.g. , sec .  5 of ref .   and ref .  ) .    from this immense body of results ,",
    "one notices that fcs in time - extensive problems can be conveniently classified by the analytic properties of the fcs generating function per period ( [ chi - extensive ] ) .",
    "namely , two main phases can be identified : @xmath6 may either be analytic on the unit circle of real @xmath7 or have a singularity at certain values of @xmath7 .",
    "correspondingly we distinguish two phases of fcs : _ analytic _ and _ nonanalytic_.    in the present paper",
    "we show that the existence of these two phases is a very general feature of fcs : phase transitions between them occur both in classical stochastic models and in quantum systems .",
    "we illustrate our discussion with several examples : the classical weather model and quantum systems of noninteracting fermions . for quantum examples , we use the results of our recent work@xcite to show the stability of the analytic phase for a wide class of non - interacting fermionic systems , even at finite temperature .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible identification of the two phases in terms of cumulants and conjecture the general form of the asymptotic long - time behavior of the fcs in the nonanalytic phase .",
    "the generating function ( [ gen - function - def ] ) is periodic , @xmath8 , and its fourier components @xmath0 are non - negative .",
    "furthermore , the probabilities @xmath0 always obey the normalization condition @xmath9 , and therefore for non - negative @xmath0 the series ( [ gen - function - def ] ) converges uniformly on the unit circle @xmath10 . typically , @xmath0 decay sufficiently rapidly as functions of @xmath1 , and then @xmath4 is analytic for real values of @xmath7",
    ".    out of the above three properties ( periodicity , non - negativity of probabilities and analyticity ) only the first one ( periodicity ) necessarily holds for the generating function per period ( [ chi - extensive ] ) from its definition .",
    "as we shall see below , both the non - negativity of the fourier components ( `` quasiprobabilities '' ) and the analyticity may be broken for @xmath11 .",
    "note that non - negativity of the quasiprobabilities is not always related to analyticity ( e.g. , @xmath11 may be analytic and still have some negative quasiprobabilities ) .    as we shall see below ,",
    "most common nonanalityc features of @xmath11 are discontinuities and kink points . in those cases ,",
    "the quasiprobabilities decay algebraically in @xmath1 and oscillate in sign ( if the singularity is located at @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , an analytic @xmath13 corresponds to an exponential decay of the quasiprobabilities ( not necessarily non - negative ) .",
    "thus we may view the difference between the analytic and nonanalytic behaviors of @xmath13 as a distinction between two quantum phases .",
    "as usual for phase transitions , the transition to the nonanalytic phase appears only in the thermodynamic limit ( when one considers the extensive part of the generating function ) .",
    "we may also remark in passing that there is nothing surprising in negative quasiprobabilities in the extensive generating function @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , this generating function appears in our attempt to factorize the full fcs into @xmath5 independent processes ( [ chi - extensive ] ) .",
    "generally , there is no reason to expect that such decomposition is possible with physical non - negative probabilities , since the system has certain correlations between different periods .",
    "the simplest stochastic process that illustrates the analytic - nonanalytic phase transition is the so called `` weather model''.@xcite suppose that the weather on each day can be of two types : rainy or sunny , and that the weather on a given day is chosen randomly with the probabilities depending on the weather on the previous day .",
    "let the probability of a sunny day after a sunny day be @xmath14 and the probability of a rainy day followed by a rainy day be @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "parameter space .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the nonanalytic phase ( na).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]   parameter space .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the nonanalytic phase ( na).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=12.0% ]    this defines a stochastic process , in which the fcs for the number of sunny days can be easily calculated.@xcite the calculation involves two generating functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which correspond to the conditions that the last day is sunny or rainy , respectively .",
    "the evolution of these generating functions is described by a linear operator acting in the two - dimensional space . the full generating function",
    "is then given by @xmath18^n + c_2 [ \\omega_2(\\lambda)]^n\\ , ,   \\label{chiweather}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the number of observation days , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the two eigenvalues of the evolution operator , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are some coefficients .",
    "therefore @xmath23 where the eigenvalue with the maximal absolute value is chosen .",
    "then two phases are possible : either one eigenvalue remains leading for all values of @xmath7 ( analytic phase ) or the leading eigenvalue switches at some value of @xmath7 ( nonanalytic phase ) . from the explicit formula for the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath24 one can deduce the phase diagram in the @xmath25 coordinates , ( fig .",
    "1b ) and find that the nonanalyticity occurs at @xmath26 .",
    "as quantum examples illustrating the analytic - nonanalytic transition in time - periodic fcs , we consider systems of non - interacting fermions . this class of systems has been studied extensively,@xcite with the main result given by the so - called levitov ",
    "lesovik determinant formula for the characteristic function ( [ gen - function - def ] ) .",
    "@xcite in the periodic case , the same determinant formula can be used to find the extensive part of the fcs ( [ chi - extensive ] ) by simply imposing periodic boundary conditions in time.@xcite    for simplicity , we consider here a one - channel quantum contact of non - interacting spinless fermions .",
    "the transparency of the contact @xmath27 is taken to be time - independent , but we assume a time - dependent voltage @xmath28 applied to the contact and an arbitrary temperature @xmath29 .",
    "this system was considered in previous works , @xcite and we can use their results to study the analytic - nonanalytic transition in a periodic setup . the case of a more general time - dependent scattering matrix @xcite will be treated in the next section .",
    "the fcs for non - interacting fermions can be expressed in terms of the distribution function of effective transparencies @xmath30 for single - particle processes.@xcite this function determines the jump of the derivative of @xmath31 on the negative real axis of the variable @xmath32 [ so that @xmath33 : @xmath34    since , in the non - interacting case , singularities of @xmath11 are allowed only on the negative real axis of @xmath32 ( i.e. , if we take @xmath7 to be real , at @xmath35),@xcite the analytic and nonanalytic phases correspond to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .     for different examples of fcs in a quantum contact .",

    "the proof of the analytic phase thus amounts to demonstrating a gapped region around @xmath47 for a certain class of time - dependencies @xmath60 .",
    "namely , we prove below that if the trajectory of @xmath60 is confined within a certain region ( spherical cap ) , then there is a gap in the spectrum @xmath30 around @xmath47 .",

    "fig : scap ] ) .",

    "analytic _ phase .",
    "the class of trajectories for which our theorem applies is quite wide .",
    "one particular case are those trajectories , for which the _ instantaneous _ transparencies @xmath90 are bounded from above by a certain maximal transparency @xmath91 . in this case",
    ", one may safely choose @xmath92 and prove the analytic phase .",
    "interestingly , in the example ( c ) of the previous section ( @xmath48 and time - independent @xmath93 ) , it is more advantageous to tilt the vector @xmath78 so that it bisects the angle between @xmath77 and @xmath94 : this explains the gap @xmath95 in the spectrum @xmath30 in this example.@xcite    another interesting particular case is @xmath38 . in this case , @xmath30 is invariant with respect to global rotations of the trajectory @xmath76 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "this implies that the condition @xmath96 does not need to be taken into account : it suffices to cover only the trajectory @xmath76 ( and not the north pole ) by any spherical cap smaller than hemisphere , in order to prove the analytic phase . in particular",
    ", the transparencies @xmath27 and @xmath97 produce the same gaps in examples 1 and 2 of the previous section .",
    "note that the above theorem may also be extended to the case of different temperatures of both leads . in this case",
    ", we are restricted to @xmath92 ( the condition @xmath98=0 $ ] is still assumed as the absence of initial entanglement of the leads@xcite ) .",

    "we suggest that the appearance of those singularities may be the most common scenario of the analytic ",

    "these coefficients are known to have an algebraic time dependence , @xmath110 , and thus contribute logarithmically to cumulants .",
    "@xcite in fact , in these simple examples , the expression ( [ fisher - hartwig ] ) can be rigorously proven using the extended fisher - hartwig conjecture ( theorem),@xcite as the fcs in those cases is given exactly by a toeplitz determinant .",
    "we may further conjecture that the expression ( [ fisher - hartwig ] ) , with @xmath109 algebraically depending on @xmath5 , should remain valid for a larger class of models : for example , for all noninteracting fermionic systems,@xcite where the fcs problem can be reduced to the determinant of a block - toeplitz matrix .",
