    "recent advances in atom de broglie waveguide technology @xcite and its potential applicability to atom interferometry @xcite and integrated atom optics @xcite create a need for accurate theoretical modelling of such systems in the low temperature , tight waveguide regime where transverse excitations are frozen out and the quantum dynamics becomes essentially one - dimensional ( 1d ) ( tonks - gas limit ) .",
    "it has been shown by olshanii @xcite , and also recently by petrov et al .",
    "@xcite , that at sufficiently low temperatures and densities , high transverse frequencies @xmath0 , and large positive scattering length , where thermal and longitudinal zero - point energies are small compared with @xmath1 , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a thin cigar - shaped trap has dynamics which reduce to those of a 1d gas of hard core , or impenetrable , point bosons .",
    "this is a model for which the exact many - body energy eigensolutions were found in 1960 using an exact mapping from the hilbert space of energy eigenstates of an _ ideal _ gas of spinless fermions to that of many - body eigenstates of hard core , and therefore _ strongly interacting _ , bosons @xcite .",
    "in this limit there are strong short - range pair correlations which are omitted in the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) approximation , which assumes that all @xmath2 bosons occupy the same orbital ( complete bec , condensed fraction unity ) . in the absence of a trap potential",
    "it is known @xcite that the occupation of the lowest orbital is of order @xmath3 where @xmath2 is the total number of atoms , in contrast to @xmath2 for the ideal bose gas as well as the gp approximation .",
    "nevertheless , this system exhibits some bec - like behavior such as talbot recurrences following an optical lattice pulse @xcite and dark soliton - like behavior in response to a phase - imprinting pulse @xcite .",
    "the case of harmonically trapped , hard core bosons in 1d is more relevant to recent atom waveguide experiments @xcite .",
    "the spatial profile of the single - particle density is expressible in closed form , and has recently been shown @xcite to be well approximated by a modified 1d effective field theory , although we have recently shown in a numerically accurate time - dependent calculation @xcite that spatial interference fringes of separated and recombined condensates in the exact many - body solution are much weaker than those predicted by the corresponding time - dependent mean field theory @xcite .",
    "although the fermi - bose mapping theorem @xcite implies that all physical properties expressible in terms of spatial configurational probabilities are the same for the actual bosonic system and the fictitious ",
    "spinless fermion \" system used for the mapping , the momentum distribution of the bosonic system , or more generally its occupation distribution over the relevant orbitals for a given geometry , is very different in the bosonic system .",
    "it is known @xcite that for a spatially uniform system of hard core bosons in 1d , the momentum distribution is strongly peaked in the neighborhood of zero momentum , whereas that of the corresponding fermi system is merely a filled fermi sea . in the case of hard core bosons in a 1d harmonic trap , it has been an interesting question whether the system undergoes true bec or merely an attenuated one such as that in the uniform system .",
    "ketterle and van druten @xcite have shown that true bec occurs for a finite number of atoms in a 1d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) in the case of an _ ideal _ gas , but the behavior turns out to be different for the exact many - body solutions in the tonks ( 1d ) limit . the most fundamental definition of bec and the condensate orbital is based on the large distance behavior of the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath4 . if off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) is present and hence the largest eigenvalue of @xmath5 is macroscopic ( proportional to @xmath2 ) then the system is said to exhibit true bec and the corresponding eigenfunction , the condensate orbital , plays the role of an order parameter @xcite .",
    "although the precise definition of odlro requires a thermodynamic limit not strictly applicable to mesoscopic traps , the gp approximation assumes from the start that odlro and macroscopic occupation of a single orbital are good approximations in a trap , so examination of this assumption is important .",
    "we have recently @xcite used the fermi - bose mapping theorem to determine , for this case of 1d impenetrable bosons in a harmonic trap , the exact many - body ground state and its salient features , including the one - particle reduced density matrix and its eigenvalues ( occupation number distribution function ) and eigenfunctions ( natural orbitals ) , as well as the momentum distribution function .",
    "we find that the largest eigenvalue of the one - particle density matrix is proportional to lower than the first power of @xmath2 , as is the momentum distribution function at @xmath6 , so that the tonks gas does not show true bec .",
    "in this paper we give an overview of our recent work on exact many - body quantum solutions for 1d tonks gases .",

    "ii and iii describe the ground state and dynamic properties of tonks gases , respectively . for the most part we investigate 1d tonks gases assuming the conditions are satisfied for realizing them . in sec .",
    "iv we examine the use of bessel optical dipole traps for experimental realization of 1d tonks gases .",
    "we first describe the fermi - bose mapping method for obtaining exact solutions of the time - independent many - body schrdinger equation in the tonks limit ( impenetrable point bosons ) and its application to the spatially uniform case ( no trap potential ) .",
    "this description is very brief and the original literature @xcite should be consulted for details .",
    "some salient features of the recent generalization to the harmonically trapped tonks gas @xcite are then described .",
    "our basic model consists of @xmath2 bosonic atoms at zero temperature moving in 1d ( @xmath7 ) , the quantum motion in the other two spatial dimensions having been frozen out by tight transverse confinement via an atomic waveguide .",
    "the schrdinger hamiltonian is then assumed to have the structure : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the one - dimensional position of the @xmath10 particle ( atom ) and @xmath11 is symmetric ( invariant ) under permutations of the particles .",
    "the two - particle interaction potential is assumed to contain a hard core of 1d diameter @xmath12 .",
    "this is conveniently treated as a constraint on allowed wave functions @xmath13 : @xmath14 rather than as an infinite contribution to @xmath11 , which then consists of all other ( finite ) interactions and external potentials .",
    "let @xmath15 be a fermionic solution of @xmath16 which is antisymmetric under all particle pair exchanges @xmath17 , hence all permutations .",
    "one can consider @xmath18 to be either the wave function of a fictitious system of `` spinless fermions '' , or else that of a system of real fermions whose spins are all aligned , as in magnetically trapped atomic vapor becs .",
    "define a  unit antisymmetric function \" @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the algebraic sign of the coordinate difference @xmath21 , i.e. , it is + 1(-1 ) if @xmath22(@xmath23 ) . for given antisymmetric @xmath18 ,",
    "define a bosonic wave function @xmath24 by @xmath25 which defines the fermi - bose mapping .",
    "@xmath24 satisfies the hard core constraint ( 2 ) if @xmath18 does , is totally symmetric ( bosonic ) under permutations , obeys the same boundary conditions as @xmath18 , and @xmath26 follows from @xmath27 @xcite . in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( no trap potential , spatially uniform system )",
    "one must add the proviso that the boundary conditions are only preserved under the mapping if @xmath2 is odd , but the case of even @xmath2 is easily accomodated by imposing periodic boundary conditions on @xmath18 but _ anti_periodic boundary conditions on @xmath24 . for a trapped system the boundary condition that wave functions vanish at infinity",
    "is preserved for all @xmath2 .",
    "the mapping theorem leads to explicit expressions for all many - body energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of a 1d scalar condensate ( bosons all of the same spin ) under the assumption that the only two - particle interaction is a zero - range hard core repulsion , represented by the @xmath28 limit of the hard - core constraint .",
    "such solutions were obtained in sec .",
    "3 of the original work @xcite for periodic boundary conditions and no external potential .",
    "such a situation could be realized experimentally , for example , by trapping the tonks gas around the peak of an tight toroidal optical dipole trap formed using a red - detuned laguerre - gaussian laser beam @xcite . in a system of 1d bosons with a hard - sphere interaction of diameter @xmath12 ,",
    "it is sufficient at low densities @xcite to consider the case of impenetrable point particles , the zero - range limit @xmath28 .",

    "since the hard - core interaction has no effect in the zero - range limit for fermions , whose wave functions already vanish at contact due to antisymmetry , it follows that the fermionic ground state is a slater determinant of the lowest @xmath2 single - particle eigenfunctions @xmath44 of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) : @xmath45 the ho orbitals are @xmath46 with @xmath47 the hermite polynomials and @xmath48 being the ground state width of the harmonic trap for a single atom . by factoring the gaussians out of the determinant and carrying out elementary row and column operations",

    "we remark that for the corresponding problem of @xmath2 free fermions in a 1d ho , in which case @xmath96 is evaluated using the fermion wave function @xmath97 , the natural orbitals are simply the ho orbitals , and @xmath98 , all higher eigenvalues being zero ( filled fermi sea )",
    ". however , the n - boson wave function is the modulus of the fermion wave function , and this leads to significant differences in the spectrum of natural orbitals and eigenvalues for the hard core bose gas . in fig .",

    "this is to be contrasted with the case of a spatially uniform system of hard core bosons for which @xmath101 @xcite . in both cases",
    "the fractional occupation decreases with increasing @xmath2 , and thus does not correspond to a true condensate for which @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , the occupation of the lowest orbital may still be large , @xmath103 , and is larger than the spatially uniform case @xmath104 , so macroscopic quantum coherence effects reminiscent of bec can still result @xcite .",

    "this figure shows that as the lowest orbital occupation @xmath107 increases with increasing @xmath2 so does the range of significantly occupied higher - order orbitals with @xmath108 .",
    "this means that the dominance of the lowest orbital decreases with increasing @xmath2 , so singling out @xmath109 as a macroscopic wave function for the whole system becomes more problematic with increasing @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "the natural orbitals are plane waves , so the occupation distribution of the natural orbitals is the same as the momentum distribution .",

    "the key features are that the momentum spectrum maintains the sharp peaked structure reminiscent of the spatially uniform case @xcite for the 1d ho , and that the peak becomes sharper with increasing atom number @xmath2 .",
    "this is to be expected since as the number of atoms increase the many - body repulsion causes the system to become more spatially uniform within the trap interior .",
    "by way of contrast , for a 1d fermi gas the corresponding momentum spectrum is a filled fermi - sea , here rounded out by the trapping potential .",
    "in particular , the momentum distribution for the 1d trapped fermi gas can be expressed as @xmath123 thus , the momentum spectrum provides a means of distinguishing between the 1d fermi and tonks gases .",
    "figure [ fig : five ] shows an example of the tonks ( dashed line ) and fermi gas ( solid line ) momentum spectra for @xmath70 atoms in a harmonic trap , and the difference is clearly seen .",
    "furthermore , the distinction only grows larger with increasing number of atoms , as the filled fermi - sea broadens whereas the tonks spectrum becomes narrower . in a recent paper",
    "we have devised a scheme to measure the momentum spectrum of trapped gases based on raman outcoupling , and we refer the reader to our paper for details @xcite .",
    "the fermi - bose mapping theorem is very easily generalized so as to yield exact solutions of the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation ( tdmbse ) by noting that since the mapping function @xmath124 of eq .",

    "tdse in the given external potential , and each many - boson solution is obtained by multiplying the corresponding determinant by the mapping function @xmath124 .",
    "some salient features of our recently - obtained dynamical solutions for solitons in a ring geometry and for interference effects in a dynamically split , harmonically trapped tonks gas will be described .",
    "the description will again be brief since details are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "dark and gray solitons are a generic feature of the nonlinear schrdinger equation with repulsive interactions , and several calculations of their dynamics based on the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation have appeared @xcite , as well as experiments demonstrating their existence in atomic becs @xcite . since the underlying _",
    "many - body _ schrdinger equation is linear , this raises the question of how observed solitonic behavior arises . here",
    "this issue will be examined with the aid of exact many - body solutions for the tonks gas .",
    "the model consists of a 1d hard - core bose gas in a toroidal trap , or ring , with cross section so small that motion is essentially circumferencial .",
    "the fermi - bose mapping is employed to generate exact solutions for this problem .",
    "we identify stationary solutions which reflect some properties of dark solitons from the gp theory when the ring is pierced at a point by an intense blue - detuned laser .",
    "we also present dynamical solutions when half of an initially homogeneous ring bec is phase - imprinted via the light - shift potential of an applied laser , leading to gray soliton - like structures whose velocity depends on the imposed phase - shift @xcite .",
    "such structures are apparent for times less than the echo time @xmath127 , with @xmath31 the ring circumference and @xmath128 the speed of sound in the bec . on",
    "longer time scales the dynamics becomes very complex showing talbot recurrences which are beyond the gp theory .",
    "consider @xmath2 bosons in a tight toroidal trap , for example a toroidal optical dipole potential @xcite , and denote their 1d positions measured around the circumference by @xmath9 .",
    "this is equivalent to the exactly - solved model @xcite of @xmath2 impenetrable point bosons in 1d with wave functions satisfying periodic boundary conditions with period @xmath31 equal to the torus circumference , and the fundamental periodicity cell may be chosen as @xmath129 .",
    "however , the rotationally invariant quantum states of this problem do not reveal any dark soliton - like structures .",
    "to proceed we therefore consider the case that a blue - detuned laser field pierces the ring at @xmath130 by virtue of the associated repulsive dipole force : the light sheet then provides a reference position for the null of the dark soliton .",

    "however , some estimates are in order to set the appropriate time scales : if we consider @xmath187rb with a ring of circumference @xmath188 @xmath189 m , and a high transverse trapping frequency @xmath190 hz , then we are limited to atom numbers @xmath191 @xcite , so these are small condensates .",
    "we then obtain @xmath192 s , and @xmath193 ms for @xmath176 .",
    "finally , we remark that since our approach relied on the mapping between the strongly - interacting bose system and a non - interacting  spinless fermi gas \" model , this suggests that dark and gray solitons should also manifest themselves in the density for the 1d fermi system .",
    "although real fermions have spin , the interactions used here to generate solitons were spin - independent .      mean - field theory ( mft ) has proven remarkably successful at predicting both the static and dynamic behavior of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in weakly - interacting atomic vapors @xcite , including the ground state properties @xcite , the spectrum of collective excitations @xcite , four - wave mixing @xcite , matter - wave solitons @xcite , and interference between becs @xcite .",
    "the basic notion underlying mft is of a macroscopic wave function @xcite , or order parameter , which defines the spatial mode into which a significant fraction of the atoms condense below the critical temperature .",
    "the macroscopic wave function typically obeys a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , the gross - pitaevskii equation , and is most suitable for dilute bose gases .",
    "however , the success of mft is not assured in all cases .",
    "for example , in one - dimension ( 1d ) a spatially homogeneous ideal gas in its many - body ground state exhibits complete bec into the lowest single - particle state , but no bec at any nonzero temperature .",
    "furthermore , previous exact analysis @xcite of a spatially uniform tonks gas by one of us ( mg ) and its extension by lenard @xcite and vaidya and tracey @xcite have shown that in the many - body ground state the occupation of the lowest single - particle state is of order @xmath3 where @xmath2 is the total number of atoms , in contrast to @xmath2 for usual bec , and similar behavior , but with a slightly larger exponent , occurs in the harmonically trapped tonks gas @xcite . we have recently shown that mean - field theory breaks down in the analysis of the dynamics of 1d atom clouds , in that it predicts interference effects that are absent in the exact theory @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with a quartic nonlinearity to extend the usual mean - field theory for 1d atom clouds . for a harmonic trap the ground - state density profiles from their theory show excellent agreement with the exact many - body results ( see fig . 1 of their paper ) .",
    "the key question , then , is whether this extended nlse can be used in all circumstances . to address this issue we examine the problem of a 1d atomic cloud in the ground state of a harmonic trap that is split by a blue - detuned laser and recombined , both using an exact many - body treatment based on the fermi - bose mapping and the approximate nlse :",
    "the nlse predicts interference whereas the exact analysis does not .",
    "consider a tonks gas which is initially in its @xmath2-body ground state in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "a central gaussian repulsive potential simulating a blue - detuned laser field is turned on quasi - adiabatically at time @xmath149 to split the initial state . after some time @xmath194 both the harmonic trap and repulsive potential are turned off and the two split components allowed to recombine : this is an interference experiment of the cool , cut , interfere variety previously discussed @xcite .",
    "the external potential is taken of the specific form @xmath195 and @xmath196 for @xmath197 .",
    "figure [ fig : eight ] shows an illustrative example for @xmath70 with a repulsive potential of height @xmath198 , and width @xmath199 , with @xmath200 the ground state harmonic oscillator width , and @xmath201 .",
    "this figure shows a gray scale plot of the single - particle density @xmath202 of the @xmath2-boson system as functions of @xmath203 ( horizonatal axis ) and position @xmath204 ( vertical axis ) , with white being the highest density .",
    "the potential height was chosen such that @xmath205 , where @xmath189 is the chemical potential of the @xmath2-particle oscillator ground state @xcite , noting that the top of the @xmath2-particle fermi sea is at @xmath206 .",
    "as expected , as the repulsive potential turns on it splits the initial ground state into two separated components . upon release at @xmath207 the two components",
    "expand and subsequently recombine .",
    "what is noteworthy is that although there is some modulation upon recombination there are no strong interference fringes indicative of the interference provisionally expected for bosons : this was a generic finding from our simulations irrespective of the time scale on which the repulsive potential was turned on @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the density @xmath208 for each individual orbital @xmath209 can show strong fringes , but with a different period in each case .",
    "thus , the minimal inteference is a result of washing out of the individual interferences by summing over n orbitals .",
    "thus , the remnant of any interference fringes decreases with increasing @xmath2 and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "physically , it makes sense that the interference fringes are all but absent since the fermi - bose mapping shows that in this 1d limit the system of bosons acts effectively like a system of free fermions insofar as effects expressible only in terms of @xmath210 are concerned , so interference is not expected @xcite .",
    "the lack of interference is therefore a signature of the fermi - bose duality that occurs in 1d systems of impenetrable particles @xcite .",
    "we next turn to the mean - field description proposed by kolomeisky _",
    "@xcite for low - dimensional systems . in particular",
    ", they introduce an order parameter @xmath211 , normalized to the number of particles @xmath2 , for such systems . using energy functional arguments",
    "they deduce the following nlse with quartic nonlinearity for a 1d system of impenetrable bosons : @xmath212\\phi   .\\ ] ] our goal is to compare the predictions of this nlse for the same cool , cut , interfere simulation in figure [ fig : eight ] , with the initial condition @xmath213 corresponding to the exact many - body solution , all other parameters being equal .",
    "figure [ fig : nine ] shows the corresponding gray - scale plot of the density @xmath214 , and two features are apparent : first , during the splitting phase when the repulsive potential is on there is very good overall agreement between the exact many - body theory and the nlse prediction .",
    "second , when the split components are released and recombine they produce pronounced interference fringes , in contrast to the exact theory .",
    "indeed , this interference in the mft is to be expected on the basis of previous theoretical work @xcite , even though a quartic ( rather than quadratic ) nonlinearity is employed here .",
    "thus the mft can not accurately capture the time - dependent dynamics in all situations .",
    "so far we have assumed that conditions are satisfied for the tonks limit . however , previous analysis by olshanii @xcite and petrov et al .",
    "@xcite show that there are stringent requirements on the temperature , transverse confinement , and linear atom number density to approach the tonks limit .",
    "clearly , what is needed first of all it to create a thin cigar shaped atomic trap so that the transverse mode becomes frozen and the atomic motion becomes essentially 1d .",
    "recent experimental developments suggest that tonks gases may be realizable in magnetic atom waveguides @xcite , and bongs et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a hybrid trap composed of optical dipole trap formed with a first - order lg beam combined with magnetic longitudinal trapping .",
    "here we examine the use of bessel optical dipole traps as an all - optical means to realize 1d tonks gases .",
    "ideal bessel beams are solutions of the free - space wave equation which propagate with unchanging beam profile along the propagation axis which we take as @xmath7 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath215 . the electric field of a monochromatic , linearly polarized ideal bessel beam of order @xmath216 and frequency @xmath217 is @xcite @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a scale electric field value , @xmath220 is the @xmath216th order bessel function",
    ", @xmath221 is the azimuthal mode number which we take as positive for simplicity in notation , and @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the radial and longitudinal wavevectors such that @xmath224 with @xmath225 .",
    "the zeroth - order solution @xmath226 has a central maximum surrounded by concentric rings of roughly equal power while the higher - order solutions @xmath220 have zero on - axis intensity also with concentric rings .",
    "the ultility of bessel beams for optical dipole traps lies in the fact that they can produce very elongated , and hence low aspect ratio quasi-1d traps . in practice",
    ", of course , one can not produce an ideal bessel optical beams as it carries infinite power .",
    "however , using axiconal optics finite power approximations to bessel beams can be produced which can propagate over significant distances .",
    "the basic scheme is illustrated in figure [ fig : ten ] where an incident laguerre - gaussian beam of azimuthal mode index @xmath216 is transformed into a bessel beam of the same order .",
    "the interested reader is referred to our recent paper @xcite for details , but for an incident gaussian beam on the axiconal optics the resulting zero - order bessel beam intensity profile past the axicon is @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the input spot size , @xmath229 the input power , @xmath230 , @xmath137 and @xmath231 are the index and opening angle of the axicon , and @xmath232 which gives the longitudinal extent of the bessel beam .",
    "this intensity profile of the bessel optical beam is readily converted to an effective dipole potential @xmath233 with @xmath234 the laser detuning from the optical transition frequency @xmath235 , @xmath236 the natural linewidth of the optical transition , @xmath237 is the resonant saturation intensity , and @xmath238 . for a red - detuned laser",
    "the potential is negative and the atoms are attracted to the regions of high intensity , whereas for a blue - detuned laser the atoms are repelled into the low field regions . here for a red - detuned laser we have approximated the bessel optical dipole potential by a parabolic potential near the axis under conditions of tight confinement , where @xmath239 is the longitudinal position of the peak of the bessel beam , and @xmath240 a red - detuned ( @xmath241 ) @xmath226 optical dipole potential therefore provides confinement in both the radial and longitudinal directions . here @xmath242 is the radial oscillation frequency with corresponding ground state oscillator width @xmath243 , and @xmath244 is the ratio between the longitudinal and radial trap frequencies @xmath245 @xcite , which also determines the aspect ratio between the radial and longitudinal ground state widths @xmath246 ( in the absence of many - body repulsion ) .",
    "petrov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have theoretically studied the diagram of state for a one - dimensional gas of trapped bosons , assuming @xmath247 , and found that a true bec , or at least a quasi - condensate , with concomitant macroscopic occupation of a single state , is only attained for high enough particle numbers @xmath248 with @xmath249 for @xmath250 and temperatures @xmath251 , one obtains a tonks gas of impenetrable bosons for which hard core repulsion between the bosonic atoms prevents them from penetrating through each other in the one - dimensional system , and the system acquires properties reminiscent of a one - dimensional system of fermionic atoms .",
    "a highly elongated bessel beam discussed , say with parameters @xmath252 nm , @xmath253 w , @xmath254 cm , @xmath255 @xmath189 m , would be an ideal candidate for the experimental realization of a tonks gas . the low aspect ratio @xmath256 and tight radial confinement @xmath257 nm result in a high upper boundary @xmath258 for the particle number of the tonks gas .",
    "for the commonly used @xmath187rb isotope with a scattering length @xmath259 nm one finds @xmath260 . although this is still a fairly low value it should be possible to experimentally realize a small @xmath187rb tonks gas .",
    "however , more promising would be the use of the @xmath261rb isotope , where a feshbach resonance can be used to tune the normally negative scattering length to positive values of several hundred nanometers magnitude @xcite . as @xmath258 is proportional to the square of the scattering length even a moderate increase to @xmath262 nm",
    "would make it possible to create a larger tonks gas , with say @xmath263 atoms , which should be easily detectable .",
    "the bessel beam trap offers some advantages compared to alternative suggested approaches using magnetic waveguides @xcite and a hybrid magnetic - optical trap @xcite .",
    "firstly , it involves only a very simple _ all - optical _ system for which the aspect ratio of the trap may be controlled simply by varying the gaussian spot size incident on the axicon .",
    "more specifically , being all - optical , it does not involve material surfaces as in magnetic waveguides , which can cause matter - wave decoherence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it allows for the possibility of trapping multiple magnetic sublevels and the investigation of multi - component tonks gases , which would not be possible in the hybrid magnetic - optical trap of bongs _ et al .",
    "in this paper we have given an overview of our work on the quantum dynamics of 1d trapped tonks gases . in particular",
    ", we hope to have shown that tonks gases display a rich variety of behaviors that are worthy of experimental investigation .",
    "the fermi - bose mapping approach to solving for the 1d tonks shows that many features are shared between the tonks gas of impenetrable bosons and a 1d gas of non - interacting fermions : they have the same ground state energies and density profiles , and neither shows true bec . however , the tonks and fermi gases differ markedly in their momentum spectra , and we have devised a scheme to measure this difference @xcite . furthermore , we have shown that the 1d tonks gas can show dark soliton - like solutions which are typically associated with solutions of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this is so in spite of the fact that mean - field theory greatly overestimates the coherence properties of the tonks gas , as we demonstrated in our simulations of split and recombined tonks gases .",
    "our work presented here shows that tonks gases have some degree of coherence but much less than a true bec , and this may have implications for proposed atomic interferometers employing high density , eg .",
    "atom laser , sources .",
    "in particular , strong transverse confinement is desirable in atomic interferometers to avoid multi - transverse mode effects , and at the same time one would like to keep the atomic density down to avoid many - body shifts , but these are exactly the requirements for the tonks limit !",
    "therefore it is very important to study the bec - tonks transition @xcite and its effect on the performance of atom interferometers .",
    "we hope that our work is a first step in this direction .",
