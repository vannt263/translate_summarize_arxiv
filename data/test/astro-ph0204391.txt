    "deep x - ray imaging of crowded fields , even with increasing angular resolution and sensitivity ( with _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ , and now _ chandra _ ) , is invariably limited by the small number of source counts and by the relative size of the point - spread function ( psf ) compared to the angular separation between the objects . determining the underlying source configuration in such a regime is often beyond the capabilities of conventional source - finding algorithms .",
    "classical x - ray source detection methods are based on a sliding detection cell of a fixed size across the image , and calculating the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) at each step . to find @xmath0 , common detection algorithms for processing data from _",
    "einstein _ and _ rosat _ ( implemented in iraf / pros )",
    "use either an average background ( as determined from a source - free section of the image ) or a local background ( from a region around the detection cell ) .",
    "however , both methods fail to discern blended faint sources in crowded fields where the background is affected by overlapping psfs .",
    "source detection is somewhat improved by image deconvolution , e.g.  with the lucy ",
    "richardson ( l - r ) algorithm or with the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , or by wavelet smoothing .",
    "deconvolution algorithms provide higher positional sensitivity in moderately crowded fields , but suffer from such undesirable effects as noise - amplification and `` leakage '' ( associating counts from fainter sources to brighter nearby ones ) .",
    "wavelet detection implemented as task wavdetect in the _ chandra _ processing package ( available at http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao ) does well in crowded fields , provided the sources are either sufficiently separated ( @xmath135  fwhm , or @xmath135  arcsec ) or within @xmath223  fwhm _ and _ are similar in flux @xcite .",
    "when the psfs are heavily blended ( separation between the source centroids @xmath3  fwhm ) , individual sources can not be distinguished and their relative fluxes can not be measured .",
    "a superior source - detection method is needed for severely crowded fields containing multiple faint sources , e.g.  globular cluster cores @xcite , or nuclear bulges in external galaxies .",
    "a powerful technique to compare statistics - limited samples is the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( k - s ) test which , unlike its alternative  the pearson @xmath4 test  does not require binning of the data . unfortunately , the classical k - s test is applicable only to one - dimensional distributions , and any attempts to convert a two - dimensional image to one dimension ( e.g.  by collapsing it onto a vector , or by azimuthal binning around a point ) lead to unwanted loss of information and power . for some time now , a multi - dimensional version of the k - s test has been known @xcite , which performs better than the @xmath4 test in the small - number statistics case ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , ff ) , and can be successfully applied in parameter point estimation in a manner similar to the widely used maximum - likelihood ( ml ) method . these properties of the multi - dimensional k - s test",
    "make it viable for incorporation in source - detection methods .    in this paper , we re - visit the characteristics of the k - s test in two ( and three ) dimensions and examine its power in comparing different realisations of crowded low @xmath0 fields . as an application of the test",
    ", we devise an iterative source - modelling scheme that aims to minimise the k - s statistic in search of the optimum underlying source distribution in an image . based on our monte carlo simulations",
    ", we find that our iterative algorithm is a powerful tool for faint object searches in crowded fields .",
    "we apply the algorithm to determine the faint x - ray source distribution in a deep _ rosat _ exposure of the post core - collapse globular cluster ngc  6397 , which has also been analysed with ml techniques by @xcite .",
    "we compare the derived x - ray positions with those of @xcite and with our subsequent optical ( _ hst _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray ( _ chandra _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) identifications .",
    "the classical one - dimensional ( 1d ) k - s test makes use of the probability distribution of the quantity @xmath5 , defined as the largest absolute difference between the cumulative frequency distributions of the parent population and that of an @xmath6-point sample extracted from it . since @xmath5 is approximately proportional to @xmath7 , one usually refers to the probability distribution of the quantity @xmath8 . for a given @xmath6 ,",
    "the values of @xmath9 corresponding to a given significance level @xmath10 ( denoted as @xmath11 ) increase slightly with @xmath6 . for large @xmath6 , the integral probability distribution @xmath12 approaches the asymptotic expression @xcite : @xmath13 which is satisfactory for @xmath14 .",
    "for the two - sample k - s test , which compares distributions of different sizes ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , the probability distribution @xmath17 remains unchanged provided that @xmath6 is set to @xmath18 .",
    "the 1d nature of the test implies that it does not depend in any way on the shape of the parent distribution .    in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) distribution ,",
    "each data point is characterised by a pair of values , @xmath19 . as with the 1d k - s test",
    ", the maximum cumulative difference between two 2d distributions is found over the @xmath19-plane . in the case of distributions in more than one dimension however , the procedure to cumulate the information onto the plane is not unique .",
    "ff made use of the total number of points in each of the four quadrants around a given point @xmath20 , namely , the fraction of data points in the regions @xmath21 .",
    "the 2d statistic @xmath5 is defined as the maximum difference between data fractions in any two matching quadrants of the sample and of the parent population , ranging over all data points .",
    "the @xmath9 statistic is defined similarly as in the 1d case , @xmath22 , where for a two - sample 2d k - s test @xmath23 .    based on their monte carlo simulations ,",
    "ff deduce that the 2d integral probability distribution @xmath17 depends solely on the correlation coefficient ( @xmath24 ) of the model distribution , i.e.  that for a given @xmath24 the distribution of @xmath9 in the 2d k - s test is ( nearly ) independent of the shape of the model , as in the classical 1d k - s test .",
    "ff also observe that in the two - sample case , it is sufficient to take the average of the correlation coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the samples as an estimate of @xmath24 .    an important distinction between @xcite s and",
    "ff s version of the 2d k - s test was pointed out to us by the referee , which makes the latter generally less stringent .",
    "ff restrict the search for the maximum cumulative difference @xmath5 to loci harbouring a data point , thereby often missing the location of the true maximum difference , which is almost always found for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two different data points .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum cumulative difference computed in such a way will have a tendency to vary in the same manner as the true maximum difference .",
    "thus the ff statistic is probably well - behaved , at least as long as the genuine parent population distribution and the assumed one are not too different @xcite .",
    "the latter situation is indeed expected when comparing distributions of point - spread functions in two images .",
    "the advantage of ff s approach is speed : order @xmath6 , instead of @xmath30 .",
    "the disadvantage is its approximate nature and that the @xmath5 statistic is sensitive to the correlation coefficient @xmath24 of the distributions , requiring its inclusion as a free parameter in the reference tables .",
    "our monte carlo experiments below take into account both factors .      following the procedure in ff",
    ", we used the 2d k - s test computer code provided in _ numerical recipes _",
    "@xcite to run our own monte carlo experiments .",
    "we studied the @xmath9 statistic by means of a monte carlo procedure using a uniform distribution ( @xmath31 ) within the unit square as a parent population .",
    "the analysis comprised of cases with number of points @xmath6 per sample ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 . for any given @xmath6 we produced a large number of simulations ( from 100000 for @xmath32 to 1000 for @xmath33 ) , enabling us to construct the integral probability distribution @xmath17 with sufficient accuracy .",

    "@xmath37 the @xmath38 confidence radius of the position of x6 is infinite , because the k - s probability that the model and the image represent the same parent distribution is always above 5 per cent , regardless of the source location .",
    "@xmath39 u18 , u24 and u43 are @xcite _ chandra _ ids .",

    "a boresight offset ( @xmath44  pix and @xmath45  pix ) has been applied to match the positions of our best - constrained source ( x5 ) and its _ chandra _ counterpart ( u24 ) .",
    "when the emission from two _ chandra / hst _ sources corresponds to a single _ rosat _ source , the latter has been associated with the mean position of the _ chandra / hst _ sources .",
    "to get an idea of the superior performance of our source - modelling scheme we compared it to established source - detection algorithms , such as the classical `` sliding - cell '' detect , the wavelet detect , the iraf / daophot psf - fitting task allstar , and ml analysis .",
    "we also used deconvolution routines on the image to determine possible source locations .",
    "below we discuss briefly each of these alternatives .",
    "_ sliding - cell detect : _ the sliding - cell detect algorithm is based on @xmath0 calculation and was not expected to perform well in a crowded low-@xmath0 field . indeed , the two versions of this algorithm in the iraf / pros package ( tasks imdetect and ldetect in the xspatial package ) fail to produce the expected number of x - ray sources in the cluster .",
    "imdetect uses a constant average background for the entire image , and a variable detect cell size ( squares with sides from 4  arcsec to 24  arcsec ) to search for sources .",
    "the larger detect cells fail to find more than three sources in the central region of ngc  6397 , whereas the 4-arcsec detect cell size is too small for use with our psf ( fwhm @xmath46  arcsec ) , and produces an unjustified high number of individual sources .",
    "the local detect algorithm ( task ldetect ) calculates @xmath0 around each pixel , using the local background ( in a region between 1.5  arcsec and 2.5  arcsec from the source ) as an estimate of the noise . as a result it does not handle crowded fields adequately , and can not distinguish blended sources .",
    "even the two smallest detection cells ( 6  arcsec @xmath47 6  arcsec and 9  arcsec @xmath47 9  arcsec ) do not find more than 3 sources in the image in figure  [ fig_ngc ] .",
    "_ wavelet detect : _ this algorithm based on the wavelet transform has only recently been applied to imaging astronomy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and has been demonstrated to outperform other source detection algorithms in low-@xmath0 fields .",
    "we used an implementation of the wavelet detect based on the marr wavelet , or the `` mexican hat '' function , coded in the wavdetect task in the _ chandra _ detect 1.0 package .",
    "the algorithm is most sensitive to structures of size approximately equal to the width of the mexican hat function .",
    "running wavdetect on our ngc  6397 image ( figure  [ fig_ngc ] ) with transforms of width @xmath48  arcsec produced only the same three sources already found by the sliding - cell algorithms .",
    "this was not unexpected , since in simulated images for the _ chandra _ high resolution camera ( fwhm = 0.5  arcsec ) , wavdetect is unable to discern point sources less than 2 fwhm apart .",
    "_ image deconvolution : _ there exist a number of widely used image deconvolution algorithms that are applicable to moderately crowded fields . after comparing results from the iraf implementations of the maximum entropy method , the l - r algorithm ( both applicable primarily to optical images ) , and from clean ( used mostly in radio imaging )",
    ", we found that l - r deconvolution @xcite most reliably discerns the five - source distribution found by our iterative source - modelling scheme ( section  [ sec_ngc ] ) .",
    "the positions of the peaks in the deconvolved image are in excellent agreement ( to within @xmath49  pix = @xmath50  arcsec ) with the k - s best - fit source positions , which exemplifies the usefulness of l - r deconvolution in analysing crowded fields .",
    "unfortunately , the l - r method does not provide a measure of the goodness of fit of these positions and of the significance of the peaks in the reconstructed image . these need to be determined separately with a multi - source fitting routine ( since the field is crowded ) , such as daophot / allstar , or the current ( 2d k - s ) iterative method .",
    "furthermore , the obtained intensities of the deconvolved sources are in much poorer agreement with the ones from the 2d k - s best - fit model .",
    "nevertheless , l - r deconvolution does give an indication for the existence of more than 3 sources ( which could not be determined with the source - searching methods ) .",
    "the l - r method thus provides a very good initial guess for the source configuration , which can be input to iterative source - modelling algorithms .",
    "_ daophot / allstar : _ the daophot package is designed for the analysis of crowded optical images , and as such it assumes that the images are in the gaussian statistics ( high number of counts per pixel ) regime .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the package is inapplicable to data governed by poisson statistics , such as most x - ray images ( including our ngc  6397 image , containing @xmath51 counts per pixel ) , because it severely underestimates random errors .",
    "however , until recently daophot was the only widely available software for reduction of crowded fields , and it has been suggested @xcite that it can be useful for analysing crowded x - ray fields .",
    "our experience with allstar is that it is heavily dependent on several loosely defined parameters which , in regimes of severe source confusion and low signal - to - noise as in our ngc  6397 image ( figure  [ fig_ngc ] ) , critically determine the performance of the task .",
    "we found that different combinations of the values of the parameters and of the initial guess for the source distribution produced different final results , in which the number of detected sources in the ngc  6397 image varied from 2 to 5 .",
    "by judiciously adjusting its parameters , allstar can be made to detect 5 sources , however that combination is not favoured statistically over other combinations with fewer sources . in the case when allstar detects 5 sources , the obtained positions and intensities are such that the k - s probability of similarity with the _ rosat _ image is @xmath52 per cent ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "_ maximum likelihood : _ given our method of optimisation  minimising the maximum residual @xmath54 ( albeit we then further minimise the k - s statistic @xmath9 )  ml analysis would be expected to produce a similar fit .",
    "this is indeed the approach of @xcite in analysing the same _ rosat _ field .",
    "the results for the 5 detected sources ( model  i in @xcite ; x1x5 in this paper ) agree well ; in addition , our analysis suggests the possible presence of the faint source x6 .",
    "we choose to employ a 2d k - s test to assess the goodness of fit instead , banking on its sensitivity to diffuse distributions .",
    "as pointed out by the referee , it is a good test for the location of smeared objects , but it is rather insensitive to their width . via k - s , a source may be deduced to be unresolved , despite having broader profile , which can frequently be the case in poisson noise limited images .    we have thus demonstrated that under conditions of severe source confusion and low @xmath0 , our source - detection method based on a 2d k - s test works better than other available techniques .",
    "we attribute its performance to the fact that our approach uses the actual psf in searching for sources ( sliding - cell and wavelet detect algorithms do not ) , that no information is lost to binning ( as in the pearson @xmath4 test , used in allstar ) , and that it is more sensitive to broad emission than other tests ( e.g. , ml ) .    we have not made a comparison of our method against the pixon deconvolution method @xcite .",
    "our method was originally intended to enhance sensitivity for crowded point source detection ; the pixon method also shows good results for the detection of low surface brightness features .",
    "rigorously , the presented look - up table  [ tbl_pseudo ] ( generated by comparing simulations of models with _ a priori _ known parameters ) is not applicable when comparing an image of an unknown source distribution to a simulation with known parameters .",
    "@xcite investigates this situation for the case of the 1d k - s test and sampling from a distribution with unknown mean and variance ( `` the lilliefors test for normality '' ) .",
    "he finds that the standard 1d k - s test table is _ too conservative _ , i.e.  with an appropriately generated look - up table ( via monte carlo simulations ) , one can reject the null hypothesis that a sampled distribution is normal at a higher significance level than with the standard table .",
    "the implications of this to our case are not known , and have not been investigated . speculatively extrapolating lilliefors s conclusion ,",
    "the 2d k - s test for comparing an unknown to a known distribution should be , if anything , more powerful than presented .",
    "this would increase the significance of source x6 , making its association with the suggested by  dra variable more likely .",
    "the advantage of an ml approach here would be that likelihood ratios between different models do not suffer from such problems .      the developed detection significance test for additional sources in section  [ sec_performance ] may seem subjective , since prior knowledge is needed about the @xmath55 curve ( where @xmath56 is the number of sources in the image ) .",
    "naturally , this information is not available when working with an astronomical image representing an unknown source distribution , where @xmath56 is a sought parameter .",
    "however , due the ( nearly ) distribution - free character of the pseudo one - sample 2d k - s test ( section  [ sec_1s2s ] ) , all that is needed is the correlation coefficient @xmath24 of the counts in the image , which is readily available ( @xmath57 for the _ rosat _ image in figure  [ fig_ngc ] ) .",
    "provided that the best - fit model with @xmath58 sources represents the image reasonably well ( k - s probability @xmath59  per cent ) , the @xmath60 curve will be indistinguishable from the @xmath55 curve of the image , since the correlation coefficients of the @xmath58-source model and of the ( @xmath56-source ) image will be very similar . indeed , in our case the best - fit five - source model has @xmath61 , which given the slow dependence of the @xmath9 distribution on @xmath24 , well approximates the @xmath9 distribution for @xmath57 ( the correlation coefficient of the counts in the _ rosat _ image ) .",
    "more general than the false - detection probability is the fraction @xmath62 of cases , in which the observed image can be represented by a best - fitting model containing @xmath63 sources , where @xmath64 does not necessarily equal @xmath65 . here",
    "@xmath58 is our best guess for the number of sources in the image , and @xmath56 is the actual ( unknown ) number of sources .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 is the significance level at which we can reject the hypothesis that the image contains only @xmath64 sources . to determine @xmath62 using the 2d k - s test , we need to compare multiple images of the same field to a single model simulation with @xmath64 sources ( section  [ sec_1s2s ] ) .",
    "naturally , this can not be done , since there rarely exist multiple available images of the same field .",
    "however , @xmath62 is well approximated by the quantity @xmath67 , given that , as discussed above , @xmath60 describes well the @xmath55 distribution of the image .",
    "this is the value listed in table  [ tbl_ngc_sources ] ( using @xmath68 ) for the probability that the _ rosat _ image can be fitted with fewer than 5 sources . for @xmath69 , in @xmath67",
    "we recover the false - detection probability for the @xmath58th source , as already discussed in section  [ sec_performance ] .      the positions and the count rates of the detected sources are in excellent agreement with model  i ( based on 1995 _ rosat _ data ) of @xcite in their maximum - likelihood analysis of the same hri field .",
    "image of the core region of ngc  6793 @xcite reveals a greater complexity of sources ( figure  [ fig_ngc_sources ] ) .",
    "the source `` doubles '' cv1 and cv4 , as well as cv2 and u18 are too close ( @xmath70  arcsec @xmath71  fwhm ) to be distinguished as separate sources in the _ rosat_/hri image , and are represented as blended sources x1 and x4 , respectively .",
    "the remainder of the sources marked with open squares are too faint ( @xmath72  erg  s@xmath73 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be detected given the crowdedness of the field .",
    "none the less , there is a clear one - to - one correspondence between the brightest ( @xmath74  erg  s@xmath73 ) _ chandra _ sources , and the ones detected in the _",
    "rosat_/hri image using the 2d k - s technique .",
    "although in their model  iv @xcite predict the existence of separate x - ray counterparts to sources cv2 and u18 , that model is fit to 1991 _ rosat_/hri data when cv2 was more prominent in x - rays relative to u18 ( hence could be more accurately centroided ; cf .",
    "fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and three of the sources in the model have fixed positions . on the other hand ,",
    "in our 2d k - s test iterative analysis we have not used any fixed parameters . moreover",
    ", the k - s test suggests the existence of source u43 , detected ( albeit inconclusively , and offset by @xmath75  arcsec from its _ chandra _ position ) as source x6 , for which there exists no x - ray identification prior to the _ chandra _ results of @xcite . although the source is fainter ( log@xmath76 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than other undetected sources in the complex x1x4 , the source must have been @xmath77 brighter to have been detectable with _ rosat _ ( indeed , by  dra binaries were discovered in globular clusters as faint and flaring x - ray sources , * ? ? ?",
    "we have developed an application of the 2d k - s test @xcite in a source - detection algorithm for astronomical images . by employing the `` subpixelization '' technique on 3d astronomical images ,",
    "we show that the 2d k - s test has greater power than the 3d k - s test  the intuitive choice for such images .",
    "we use monte carlo integration to determine the cumulative values of the proposed model distribution in all four quadrants around each count and , recognising the deviations that this incurs from the derived @xmath9 distributions , we provide our own reference tables for estimating the k - s probability .",
    "we devise an iterative source - modelling routine that employs the k - s probability as a goodness of fit estimator , and can be used to find the optimum number , positions , and intensities of blended sources .",
    "we then apply the iteration scheme to a deep ( 75  ksec ) _",
    "rosat_/hri exposure of the core region of ngc  6397 and find five blended sources , as well as a possible sixth one .",
