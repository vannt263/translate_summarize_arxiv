    "all these ideas have been worked out to elaborate physical models with strong experimental support and all of them break time symmetry ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "a group of scientists around _ ilja prigogine _ ( nobel prize in chemistry 1977 ) , referred to as the `` brussels school '' , is not satisfied with the situation and has worked out a quantum mechanical formalism especially applying to unstable systems ( i.e. systems involving decay ) , where time symmetry is claimed to be broken at the microscopic level ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "if an initial hilbert state @xmath31 has gamov components , they will disappear for @xmath110 .",
    "so if the state has no rotating components , i.e. @xmath111 , the whole state will disappear in the future with the decay rates of the gamov contributions given by the imaginary part of the contributing @xmath68 : @xmath112 with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "each contribution from a gamov state also induces a certain energy shift , given by the real part of the @xmath68 .",

    "apart from the contribution of the gamov vectors one has to consider the contribution from the generalized continuous eigenvectors .",

    "the time evolution of the initial state may be approximated by an exponential decay and its energy spectrum by a breit - wigner distribution .",
    "this approximation is very popular , e.g. in quantum optics , and indeed in most cases it is a very good one .",
    "obviously the above argument does not hold for negative times . here",
    ", the contributions from the gamov vectors diverge . in several publications of the brussels school ( see e.g.  @xcite or _",
    "a. bohm _ in  @xcite ) this is an argument in favour of a broken time symmetry , since for negative times the _ advanced _",
    "decomposition  ( [ unity_ad ] ) is the better choice .",
    "however , as will be shown below , this is a rather intuitive reasoning and does not enforce a break of time symmetry .",
    "let us see what happens with the retarded decomposition of a hilbert state for negative times .",
    "of course the gamov contributions now diverge , but they are compensated by the background contribution . for @xmath132 the background integral  ( [ bg2 ] ) gains influence , since the integration path @xmath75 is placed _ below _ the complex eigenvalues @xmath68 . the same argument , that for increasing @xmath130 the background contribution can be neglected in comparison with the pole contributions , is turned upside down for @xmath133 .",
    "the smaller imaginary part of @xmath75 induces a higher divergence than the contribution of the poles . by construction",
    "their divergences cancel each other , since the sum of both yields the contribution of the standard continuous eigenvectors ( see eq .",
    "( [ unity_2rep ] ) ) , so a divergence of an initial hilbert state backwards in time is prevented .",
    "the divergence of the gamov contributions is even more than compensated : if a hilbert state decays in the future , it will also decay in the past . to see this",
    "one can use the advanced decomposition  ( [ unity_ad ] ) to investigate the system s evolution to the past and one would find a completely symmetric situation with majorizing pole contributions decaying backwards in time .",
    "the situation is different if a gamov vector @xmath134 is taken as the initial state .",
    "now there is only one pole contribution @xmath68 decaying in the future and diverging in the past .",
    "but gamov vectors are only `` existing '' in the spectral representation of hilbert states and they themselves do not refer to elements of physical reality , similiar to all other `` generalized eigenstates '' appearing in spectral decompositions . as constituted by the axiomatic foundations of quantum mechanics a physically realizable state is represented by a hilbert vector ( actually a family of hilbert vectors normalized to unity and differing only in phase ) .",
    "gamov states are no hilbert vectors , so their properties are not expected to be physically meaningful .    concluding , both decompositions are equivalent , but the use of the retarded decomposition is more _ intuitive _ for @xmath130 .",
    "however , this should not be taken as the reason for a broken time symmetry . a more convincing argument in favour of a broken time symmetry is the splitting of _",
    "test spaces_. as we have seen in  ( [ bg2 ] ) , analytic continuations of the test functions are needed to have the decompositions well - defined . in section  [ rhs ]",
    "we will get back to this point .      besides the advantages pointed out in section  [ advantages ]",
    "we now face another important advantage of the brussels school s formalism .",
    "perturbation theory can be applied even in cases where standard quantum mechanics fails .",
    "those cases are featured by the phenomenon of instability , which is strongly connected to the sensitivity of a system towards small perturbations .",
