    "in quantum optics and quantum statistical mechanics , people often come across such problems : ( 1 ) when a system is immersed in a realistic environment ; or ( 2 ) a signal ( a quantum state ) passes through a quantum channel . among them ,",
    "the decay of the radiation field inside a cavity plays an important role in many realistic problems . in general , damping of the radiation field is described by its interaction with a reservoir with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we are interested in the evolution of the variables associated with the optical field only .",
    "this requires us to obtain all relevant properties for the optical field of interest only after tracing over the reservoir variables @xcite .",
    "actually , the decay of the radiation field inside a cavity is an problem on the dynamics of a open quantum system @xcite .",
    "one can use the liouville equation ( a master equation ) to describe the dynamical evolution of the density matrix of the optical field .",
    "that is , the decay ( or decoherence ) due to the interaction between a system and its environment can be described by a liouville ( super ) operator .",
    "however , the liouville ( super ) operator describes a nonunitary time evolution , which can not trivially be integrated through standard lie - algebra techniques .",
    "analytical solutions of the liouville equation can be obtain upon resorting to quasiprobability representations of the density matrix @xcite , or upon evaluating eigenvalues and eigenvectors ( i.e. eigen density matrices ) of the liouville ( super ) operator @xcite , or even upon using  group - theoretical approach @xcite , or by virtue of the thermo - entangled state representation @xcite .    followed by above works",
    ", we also pay our attention to study the optical fields propagation in realistic environment in this paper .",
    "the physical problem is abstracted into a mathematical model . then using our technique on the quantum operators and the quantum states , we cleverly deduce some formulas for the propagated optical fields .",
    "these formulas are very useful to quantum optics and quantum statistics .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "ii by introducing the theoretical model and abstracting two formalism .",
    "that is , we imagine the fact of the optical fields propagation in realistic environment as a fictitious beam splitter ( bs ) model and construct the correspondences between the optical channel formalism and the bs formalism . in sec .",
    "iii , as the section of the bs formalism , we derive the density operator of the output optical fields by using the weyl expansion of the density operator in the characteristic function ( cf ) formalism .",
    "moreover , the formula of the photon number distribution ( pnd ) and the wigner function ( wf ) for the output state are derived in detail . in sec .",
    "iv , as the section of the optical - channel formalism , we obtian the time evolution formula of the density operator , the pnd and the wf . as the application of these formulas",
    ", we use a single - photon - addition coherent state as the initial state and discuss its evolution in thermal channel in sec.v .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "the fact that a optical field propagation in the realistic environment ( in optical - channel formalism ) can be simulated as the interaction of a fictitious bs ( in the bs formalism ) .",
    "the initial optical field @xmath0 ( denoted by the input quantum state @xmath1 ) in the main mode @xmath2 and the environment ( also reservoir or channel , denoted by a general environment state @xmath3 ) in the auxiliary mode @xmath4 are interacted by a bs ( described by the operator @xmath5 ) .",

    "it should be emphased that @xmath24 is the transmission coefficient of the bs and @xmath25 is the time of the optical field propagation in the channel .    as pointed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the simple intuitive model is exact for dissipation in gaussian reservoirs .",
    "hence , we take a squeezed thermal state ( a general gaussian quantum state ) , i.e.@xmath26as the environment .",
