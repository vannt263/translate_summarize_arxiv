    "the phase structure of qcd is relevant in the description of various phenomena : from subtle modifications of the cross - sections in high energy collisions of nuclei to exotic states of nuclear matter in neutron stars .",
    "even though we have a good understanding of how to perform simulations at zero baryon density and finite temperature , the simulation with non - zero chemical potential has been problematic .    to deal with the complex phase that the chemical potential introduces to the fermion determinant ,",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed : various reweighting methods , imaginary chemical potential , etc .",
    "they allow us to explore the phase structure at small values of the chemical potential and temperatures close to the critical temperature .",
    "all these methods have as a starting point the grand canonical partition function .",
    "we will present here an approach based on the canonical partition function which alleviates the sign problem , the overlap problem and the determinant fluctuation problems  @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results will also be reported .",
    "the qcd canonical partition function with a fixed quark number can be constructed from the projection of the quark number from the determinant  @xcite .",
    "the probability of having @xmath1 quark loops more than antiquark loops wrapping around the time direction in the loop expansion of a determinant is represented by the fourier transform @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermion determinant of the quark matrix with an additional u(1 ) phase @xmath4 in the time forward / backward links on one time slice .",
    "therefore , the canonical partition function can be written as @xmath5    one can also derive this from the fourier transform of the grand canonical partition function  @xcite @xmath6 to see this we can use the fugacity expansion of the grand canonical partition function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quark number and @xmath9 is the quark chemical potential . using the usual expression for lattice qcd grand canonical partition function ,",
    "one obtains the same expression as in eq .",
    "( [ zc ] ) .    for wilson fermions we can write @xmath10 in terms of the standard fermion matrix @xmath11_{m , n } & = & \\delta_{m , n}-\\kappa ( 1-\\gamma_\\mu)u_\\mu(m)\\delta_{m+\\mu , n } \\\\ & -&\\kappa ( 1+\\gamma_\\mu)u^\\dagger_\\mu(n)\\delta_{m , n+\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and some modified gauge fields @xmath12 this",
    "should not be viewed as a change of the field variables but rather as a convenient way of writing the partition function .",
    "we should also note that although originally the phase @xmath13 appears on all timelike links , we can accumulate it on the last time slice through a change of variables .    in order to evaluate the canonical partition function in eq .",
    "( [ zc ] ) we need to replace the continuous fourier transform with a discrete one . using the discrete fourier transform of the determinant @xmath14 with @xmath15",
    ", we write the partition function as @xmath16 this is the partition function that we will try to evaluate .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 defines the fourier transform . in the limit @xmath18",
    "we recover the original partition function . for finite @xmath17",
    "the partition function will only be an approximation of the canonical partition function . using the fugacity expansion",
    "we can show that @xmath19 if @xmath20 denotes the baryon free energy we expect that @xmath21 in the confined phase . if this holds true then @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "however , this is an expectation that needs to be checked in our simulations .",
    "to evaluate @xmath24 by monte - carlo techniques we need the integrand in ( [ zcd ] ) to be real and positive . using the @xmath25 hermiticity of the wilson matrix",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath26 is real .",
    "however , the integrand in ( [ zcd ] ) is the fourier transform of the wilson determinant . for @xmath27 to be real we need that @xmath28 . from charge conjugation symmetry we know that @xmath29",
    ". unfortunately this relation does nt hold configuration by configuration .",
    "we are thus forced to remove the complex phase from @xmath27 .    to avoid dealing with the complex phase we will generate an ensemble using @xmath30 as our probability function and we will then reintroduce the complex phase in observables .",
    "this is the standard way to deal with a complex phase in the weight function .",
    "it is also the source of the infamous sign problem .",
    "this might limit us in fully exploring the parameter space .",
    "the focus of the algorithm will then be to generate an ensemble with the weight @xmath31    it was pointed out in  @xcite that taking the fourier transform after the monte carlo simulations with different @xmath32 leads to an overlap problem . to avoid this problem ,",
    "it was stressed  @xcite that it is essential to perform the fourier transform first to lock into one particular quark ( or baryon ) sector before the accept / reject step . the general approach is to break the updating process into two steps . in this case ,",
    "one first uses an update for an approximate weight @xmath33 , and then use an accept / reject step to correct for the approximation .",
    "the efficiency of this strategy depends on how good the approximation is . for a poor approximation",
    "the acceptance rate in the second step will be very small .",
    "one possible solution would be to update the gauge links using a heatbath for pure gauge action . in that case @xmath34 .",
    "however , it is known that such an updating strategy is very inefficient since the fermionic part is completely disregarded in the proposal step and the determinant , being an extensive quantity , can fluctuate wildly from one configuration to the next in the pure gauge updating process @xcite . to avoid the overlap problem and the leading fluctuation in the determinant , it is proposed  @xcite to update using the hmc algorithm in the first step . for simplicity we will be simulating two degenerate flavors of quarks .",
    "this allows us to use the standard hmc update .",
    "in this case we have @xmath35    in the second step we have to accept / reject with the probability @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ratio of the weights @xmath38|}{\\det m[u]}.\\ ] ] since @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] are calculated on the same gauge configuration , we can write the determinant ratio as @xmath41)|}{\\det m[u ] } \\omega(u ) = \\frac{1}{n } \\left| \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1 } \\cos(\\phi_n k )   e^{tr(\\log m_{\\phi_n } - \\log m)}\\right|.\\ ] ] the leading fluctuation in the determinant from one gauge configuration to the next is removed by the @xmath42 difference of the quark matrices of @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". this should greatly improve the acceptance rate compared to the case with direct accept / reject based on the @xmath45 itself .",
    "the canonical partition function ( [ zc ] ) has a @xmath46 symmetry that is not present in the grand canonical partition function  @xcite . under a transformation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is defined as in ( [ uf ] ) and @xmath49",
    "we have @xmath50\\rightarrow \\mbox{det}_k m[u_{\\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}]= e^{\\pm i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}k}\\mbox{det}_k m[u].\\ ] ] we see that when @xmath1 is a multiple of @xmath51 this transformation is a symmetry of the action .",
    "incidentally , if this symmetry is not spontaneously broken the relation above guarantees that the canonical partition function will vanish for any @xmath1 that is not a multiple of @xmath51 .    for @xmath52 ,",
    "our approximation of the canonical partition function , to exhibit this symmetry we need to choose the parameter @xmath17 that defines the discrete fourier transform to be a multiple of @xmath51 .",
    ", height=172 ]    if n is a multiple of @xmath51 we have @xmath53 however , the hmc weight @xmath54 does not respect this symmetry since @xmath55 is not symmetric under this transformation .",
    "in this case , our algorithm can become frozen for long periods of time . in fig .",
    "[ freeze ] we show the argument of the polyakov loop as a function of the simulation time . under a @xmath46 transformation @xmath56 the argument of the polyakov loop",
    "gets shifted by @xmath57 .",
    "the hmc update strongly prefers the @xmath58 sector and when a tunneling occurs to one of the other sectors the accept / reject step will reject any change for a long period of time .",
    "consequently the algorithm will be very poor in sampling the other sectors .    to alleviate this problem",
    "we will introduce a @xmath46 hopping  @xcite .",
    "since the weight @xmath59 is symmetric under this change we can intermix the regular updates with a change in the field variables @xmath56 , where we will choose the sign randomly ( equal probability for each sign ) to satisfy the detailed balance .",
    "this will decrease our acceptance by a factor of roughly @xmath51 but will sample all the @xmath46 sectors in the same manner .",
    "in order to simulate the ensemble given by the weight @xmath60 we need to evaluate the fourier transform of the determinant . since the calculation of the determinant is quite time consuming we will need to use @xmath17 as small as possible .",
    "there is a proposal that employs an estimator for the determinant  @xcite but in this preliminary study we choose to calculate the determinant exactly using lu decomposition .",
    "we were thus limited to running on very small lattices , i.e. @xmath61 , and with @xmath62 .",
    "for each @xmath63 we run three simulations : one for @xmath64 , one for @xmath65 and one for @xmath66 .",
    "they correspond to @xmath58 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 baryons in the box .",
    ".the simulation parameters for our runs.[t1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an interesting observable to measure is the polyakov loop .",
    "although the average value is expected to be zero due to the @xmath46 symmetry , the distribution in the complex plane can tell us whether or not the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "usually the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath46 symmetry is associated with deconfinement . in fig .",
    "[ poly ] we show the histograms of the polyakov loop for our runs .",
    "we see that as we go from @xmath69 to @xmath70 the symmetry is broken even in the @xmath64 sector .",
    "this is the usual finite temperature phase transition at zero baryon density . according to table  [ t1 ] this happens somewhere between @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "this is somewhat higher than expected for dynamical simulations but can be explained in terms of our large quark masses .",
    "more interestingly , we see that under the critical temperature the transition still occurs as we increase the number of baryons .",
    "it is also apparent that as we lower @xmath63 ( @xmath73 ) , we are approaching a region where even the @xmath74 sector is confined . assuming that the result of @xmath75 at @xmath73 is close to the phase transition line",
    ", the phase transition for @xmath76 occurs at the baryon density of @xmath77 which is about @xmath78 times the nuclear matter density .",
    "we see from table 1 that there does not seem to be a problem of reaching a density an order of magnitude higher than that of the nuclear matter around @xmath0 . for example , for @xmath79 at @xmath80 , the baryon density is @xmath81 which is @xmath82 times the nuclear matter density . however , we should not take these numbers seriously in view of the small volume and large quark mass in the present calculation ( since the pion mass is @xmath83 our quark mass is close to the strange quark one ) .",
    ", height=172 ]    while it is nice to see that our expectation for the phase transition are confirmed in the gluonic sector , one would like to explore this transition in the fermionic sector too .",
    "it is important to note that the fermionic observables have to be evaluated in a non - standard manner .",
    "for example , if we are to study the fermionic bilinears we get @xmath84 where @xmath85 we see that for fermionic variables , we need to do a fourier transform on the observable too .",
    "we have measured the chiral condensate in our runs in the hope that it will signal chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that the quarks are too heavy for us to get any signal .",
    "for example at @xmath86 and @xmath87 we got @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "we suspect that we need to lower the quark mass to be able to see any signal in the chiral condensate .",
    "also , since we are working with wilson fermions , the signal might be obscured by the mixing between @xmath92 and unity and other lattice artifacts especially at these large lattice spacings .",
    "it is important to note that all the calculations carried out above are using an approximation of the canonical partition function . as noted before it is an assumption on our part that @xmath93 . to check this we measured the conserved charge for wilson fermions @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the idea is that if we were to compute the conserved charge using the exact canonical ensemble @xmath95 we would measure exactly the number of quarks we put it @xmath96 .",
    "however , in the discrete case we have @xmath97 this is a weighted average over the various sectors allowed by our discretized delta function .",
    "if the approximation holds then the average of the conserved current should be closed to its exact value .    for @xmath86 ,",
    "we get the conserved charge to be @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath58 for @xmath64 and @xmath100 .",
    "we will first note that for @xmath65 we get the conserved charge to be very close to the exact value , indicating that there is very little mixing with the other allowed sectors @xmath101 .",
    "the other two values are @xmath58 due to symmetry . for @xmath64 sector , it is easy to understand . for the @xmath66 sector ,",
    "the explanation lies in the fact that @xmath62 .",
    "thus for every allowed sector @xmath102 there is an @xmath103 such that @xmath104 . in that case",
    "the sum in the numerator vanishes and the conserved charge ends up being zero .    we conclude that there is very little mixing with the other allowed sectors in our runs .",
    "we attribute the smallness of the deviation in the case @xmath65 to the fact that the free energy for our baryons is very large .",
    "however , we expect that as we lower the quark mass the deviation will become more significant .",
    "if the deviation is too large then we might have to increase the parameter @xmath17 for the discrete fourier transform .",
    "summing up , we showed that the canonical partition function approach can be used to investigate the phase structure of qcd .",
    "we are able to explore temperatures around the critical temperature and much higher densities than those available by other methods .",
    "we also find evidence that sign fluctuations might limit us in reaching much lower temperature and large fermion number .",
    "we checked that the discrete fourier approximation to the canonical partition function introduces only minimal deviations .    in our runs , we find that even for a small lattice , the picture that emerges for the phase structure is consistent with expectations .",
    "the polyakov loop shows signals of deconfining phase transition both in temperature and density directions . to complement this picture",
    "we would like to see a signal in the fermionic sector .",
    "for this we need to go to smaller masses and , maybe , to finer lattices .    another goal would be to locate certain points on the phase transition line .",
    "for this we need to get to even lower temperatures and/or densities .",
    "while , we might be limited in going to much lower temperatures , we should be able to reach lower densities . to reach a lower density with larger volume",
    ", we need to introduce an esitmator for the determinant .",
    "we should stress that the method used to generate the modified ensemble has no bearing on whether we have a sign problem or not .",
    "it is an intrinsic property of the modified ensemble .",
    "consequently , we do not expect any difference in the sign behavior as we introduce the estimator .",
