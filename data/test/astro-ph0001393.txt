    "microwave background observations and measurements of large scale structure are complementary .",
    "while the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) measures the distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe , nasa s microwave anisotropy probe ( map ; @xcite ) primarily probes the distribution of matter and radiation at z=1300 . since the nearby universe",
    "is thought to have the same statistical properties as the distant universe , we can gain insights into low - redshift physics as well as constrain cosmological parameters by cross - correlating the final conditions measured by sdss with the initial conditions probed by map ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to maximize the signal - to - noise from the cross - correlation within the limitations on the cmb data set by the specifications of the map project ,",
    "a good tracer of the low - redshift density distribution must fulfill two criteria :    1 .",
    "the tracer objects must be numerous enough that the poisson error term in the cross - correlation is small .",
    "2 .   the tracer must probe as large a volume of redshift - space as possible so that the cross - correlation signal is maximized .    in practice",
    ", one finds that object types with high number densities ( e.g. galaxies ) tend to have redshift distributions that only probe a small part of the volume and object types that probe a larger fraction of the volume ( e.g. quasars ) are less numerous .",
    "therefore it is necessary to strike a balance between these two criteria in order to optimize the signal - to - noise .    in this paper , we investigate several classes of objects that will be available in the sdss survey in order to find tracers that optimize the cross - correlation with the cmb .",
    "we find that sdss quasars with magnitude @xmath3 and galaxies with magnitude @xmath4 , which will have photometrically - determined redshifts , are good tracers .",
    "we then use the cross - correlation formalism to show that ,    1 .",
    "cross - correlating the sdss galaxy sample with @xmath4 in various redshift `` slices '' with maps of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect from map gives good constraints on the pressure fluctuations in supercluster - scale gas , and 2 .",
    "cross correlating the sdss quasar sample with @xmath3 with convergence maps from map gives strong constraints on the density parameter and the equation of state .",
    "the second - order effects that alter the microwave background and the low - redshift tracers used in the cross - correlation are introduced in   [ zcmb ] . in",
    "  [ cc - form ] we outline the cross - correlation formalism , derive an optimal filter for maximizing the signal - to - noise from it and discuss briefly the computational issues involved in the cross - correlation .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in   [ cc - res ] .",
    "we explore the possibility of constraining the equation of state with these methods in   [ quin ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in   [ finish ] .",
    "there are three primary low redshift effects that alter the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "hot gas in clusters and filaments produce new distortions in the microwave background .",
    "the sz effect ( @xcite ) is the change in energy experienced by cmb photons when they scatter from the hot gas .",
    "it takes two forms .",
    "the dominant contribution is the thermal sz effect , the gain in energy acquired from the thermal motion of the gas .",
    "the kinetic sz effect arises from the doppler shift due to the bulk motion of the gas .      in low-@xmath1 universes ,",
    "the fact that potentials decay ( in other words , matter fluctuations stop growing ) at some epoch makes another contribution to the large - scale cmb anisotropy .",
    "in addition to the redshift experienced while climbing out of potential wells on the last scattering surface , photons experience a cumulative change in energy due to the decaying potentials as they travel to the observer .",
    "the blueshift of a photon falling into a decaying potential well is not entirely cancelled by the redshift as it climbs out .",
    "this leads to a net energy change , which accumulates along the photon path .",
    "this integrated sachs - wolfe effect is distinct from the more commonly considered redshifting at the last scattering surface which has become known as the sachs - wolfe effect . both effects are considered in the original paper by @xcite .",
    "the isw effect operates most strongly on scales where the change of potential is large over a wavelength . for @xmath5cdm models ,",
    "the effect is confined to the largest angular scales ( @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath6 s .",
    "light propagating through an inhomogeneous universe is distorted through lensing by foreground matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "dark matter distributed along the line of sight between the surface of last scattering and the present epoch deflects cmb photons and imprints a characteristic pattern onto the cmb anisotropies created by acoustic oscillations . on large and intermediate scales",
    "lensing smoothes the acoustic oscillations while on very small scales it creates additional power ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have developed a useful formalism for computing the convergence of the microwave sky .",
    "the convergence is a quantity which induces random deflections in the direction of the cmb photons .",
    "it is the integrated mass density along the line of sight divided by the critical density .",
    "the sdss , which will cover about a quarter of the sky , will contain many classes of objects which trace large scale structure .",
    "these can be cross - correlated with microwave background maps produced by map .",
    "some of these are :    1 .",
    "photometric - z galaxies ( @xmath7 ) 2 .",
    "all galaxies ( @xmath8 ) 3 .",
    "spectrometric - z quasars ( @xmath9 ) 4 .   photometric - z quasars ( @xmath10 ) 5 .",
    "first objects    here , the magnitude cuts are made in the sdss @xmath11 and @xmath12 photometric bands .",
    "the first and fourth categories will have photometrically determined redshifts . the magnitude cuts for these categories reflect conservative estimates of the limiting magnitudes to which photo - z techniques can be applied ( d. eisenstein 2000 , private communication , g. richards 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "upper estimates for the expected errors in photometrically - determined redshifts for @xmath4 galaxies are about 0.04 - 0.08 . typically , at present",
    ", photometric methods for quasars give 50% of redshifts correct to within @xmath13 and 70 - 75% correct to within @xmath14 .",
    "this is fairly independent of magnitude down to @xmath15 .",
    "after that , photo - z can not be done reliably on @xmath16 qsos . however , for @xmath17 qsos , the redshift errors should be comparable .",
    "these errors should improve in the near future as details of the photo - z techniques are refined .",
    "the second category contains galaxies brighter than the @xmath18 detection limit of the sdss r filter .",
    "since we will not have redshifts for all of these galaxies , the results of cross - correlating this sample with low redshift effects are of academic interest only .",
    "the third category contains quasars for which redshifts would be obtained by the sdss spectroscopic survey . for the sdss",
    "spectroscopic quasar sample , the redshift errors are negligible ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the last category contains objects from the first survey ( @xcite ) which would be optically matched by the sdss .    approximating the radial distribution function of the tracer sample by a @xmath20-function at the mean redshift of the sample changes cross - correlation results by 5 - 10% .",
    "we estimate the signal - to - noise to change by roughly the same factor due to photometric redshift errors .",
    "in this section we introduce the notation and develop the formalism for cross - correlating each of the tracer object types with the secondary cmb anisotropies described above .",
    "we begin with the comoving friedman equation for a spatially flat universe with a cosmological constant @xmath5 : @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{a^2 h_0 ^ 2}{c^2 } \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{a^3 } + \\left(1- \\omega_0 \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the dimensionless scale factor , prime denotes derivatives with respect to conformal time @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the hubble constant and @xmath25 is the gravitational constant .",

    "these two different effects ( bias and steep number - count slope ) are important on different angular scales .",
    "quasars can also probe the density field out to high redshifts ( @xmath199 ) , thus sampling a significant fraction of the volume of redshift space .",
    "however , their surface number density is low , so depending on the cut used to select the quasars , the poisson error can be large .",
    "the surface number density of galaxies is very high , so the poisson noise of the sample is small .",
    "however , the slope of the galaxy number counts is shallow ( @xmath200 in @xmath11 band ) so the intrinsic fluctuation term of eq .",
    "[ counts - x ] dominates over the lensing term and the cross - correlation with weak lensing does not trace the foreground matter fluctuations very well .",
    "the galaxy sample only extends out to @xmath189 , and thus probes only a small fraction of the volume probed by quasars .",
    "we find that cross - correlation of weak lensing with @xmath184 quasars in the sdss survey is poisson - noise - limited and does not provide very good signal - to - noise .",
    "the @xmath4 galaxy sample performs better , but is hampered by the fact that it does not extend out to large redshifts .",
    "filtering @xmath3 photometric quasars , which have surface number density more than six times that of @xmath184 quasars ( fan 1999 ) , with the optimal filter developed in   [ max ] gives reasonably high snr .",
    "we will discuss how to use this cross - correlation to constrain @xmath1 and the equation of state in ",
    "[ quin ] .",
    "the isw effect does not produce a good snr , because it dominates at low @xmath95 where the matter power spectrum is falling and also because the sdss redshift survey does not probe to sufficient depth .",
    "optically matched first objects in the sdss survey are poisson - noise limited and are found to be useless for the purpose of cross - correlating with the cmb .",
    "the general equation of state of a density field @xmath201 is @xmath202 where @xmath2 is the ratio of pressure to density .",
    "for example , @xmath203 for dark matter , @xmath204 for radiation , and @xmath205 for @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative to the cosmological constant @xmath5 as the missing energy in a flat universe with @xmath206 is given by quintessence @xmath207 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is a time - evolving , spatially inhomogeneous energy component with negative pressure and an equation of state @xmath208 .",
    "it drives cosmological expansion at late times , influencing the growth of structure . on very large scales , the quintessence clusters",
    "gravitationally , thereby modifying the level of cmb temperature anisotropy relative to the matter power spectrum amplitude and also inducing a late - time isw effect . on small length scales , fluctuations in @xmath207 disperse relativistically and the @xmath207-field behaves as a smooth component .",
    "quintessence modifies the matter power spectrum , the time evolution of the scale factor @xmath22 and the linear growth factor @xmath123 . in this section",
    "we investigate the possibility of detecting observational imprints of @xmath207 by cross - correlating map and sdss .    following the notation of   [ lensing - cc ] , the @xmath209 for cross - correlating weakly - lensed @xmath3 quasars with the cmb convergence",

    "we apply a formalism for computing the cross - correlation between data - sets at high- and low - redshift to map data and various classes of tracer objects from the sdss , for a range of spatially - flat low-@xmath1 models with a general equation of state .",
    "three low - z effects that imprint secondary anisotropies on the cmb are considered : the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect , the integrated sachs - wolfe effect and weak lensing .",
    "using photometric redshifts , one can select a tracer sample to match the redshift windows where a particular second - order cmb anisotropy is dominantly formed , using the optimal filtering technique detailed here . as a practical algorithm",
    ", one would derive the luminosity function of the tracer sample , and hence the comoving number density of that sample for a particular cosmology .",
    "then one would guess a power spectrum and tracer bias , making use of the cmb and tracer power spectra ; construct the optimal weighting for each 3-d legendre mode as a function of redshift and multipole ; and finally project to form a two - dimensional map which is then cross - correlated with the cmb .",
    "one then estimates the power spectrum and bias from this map , and repeats the procedure until the process converges to the real optimal filter .",
    "we find that these techniques would give good constraints on pressure fluctuations of supercluster - scale gas and provide constraints on @xmath1 and the equation of state @xmath2 in quintessence models .",
    "it is found that the photometric - z quasar and galaxy samples expected from the sdss would perform well as low - z tracers .",
    "however , the complete sdss survey would be required to generate sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "we also find that the isw effect does not provide enough signal - to - noise to make use of these methods .",
