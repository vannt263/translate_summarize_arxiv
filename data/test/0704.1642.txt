    "a microscopic theory for rotons in the excitation spectra of superfluids was first developed by feynman , where he showed that the roton minima was related to a peak in the static structure factor.@xcite this study has had broad impact in condensed matter physics ranging from quantum hall effect@xcite to frustrated antiferromagnets.@xcite in recent years considerable interest has also centered on supersolid phases of matter.@xcite while the existence of such homogeneous bulk phases in helium remains controversial,@xcite in case of lattice models such phases have been clearly established .",
    "one such example is that of hard - core bosons hopping on a triangular - lattice , where a large enough nearest - neighbor repulsion leads to supersolid order.@xcite the nature of the excitation spectra in the superfluid phase and on approach to the supersolid transition has not been addressed for the spin - half model .",
    "here we use series expansion methods to study the ground state properties and excitation spectra of hard - core bosons , at half filling , on square and triangular lattices , with nearest neighbor repulsion . on the square - lattice , the model is equivalent to the antiferromagnetic xxz model , and we present the elementary excitation spectra for the xxz model with xy type anisotropy . to our knowledge",
    "this calculation has not been done before .",
    "it should be useful for experimental studies of antiferromagnetic materials with xy anisotropy .",
    "we set the xy coupling to unity and study the spectra as a function of the ising coupling @xmath0 . for the xy model ,",
    "the spectra is gapless at @xmath1 ( the goldstone mode of the superfluid ) and has a maximum at the antiferromagnetic wavevector ( @xmath2 ) . as the ising coupling",
    "is increased a roton minima develops at the antiferromagnetic wavevector , which goes to zero at the point of heisenberg symmetry ( @xmath3 ) , as expected for the system with doubled unit cell .    for the triangular - lattice , the hard - core boson model maps onto a ferromagnetic xy model , which is unfrustrated .",
    "the nearest - neighbor repulsion , on the other hand corresponds to an antiferromagnetic ising coupling , which is frustrated .",
    "this model can not be mapped onto an _ antiferromagnetic",
    "_ xxz model on the triangular lattice . for this model , we calculate the equal - time structure factor @xmath4 as well as the excitation spectra , @xmath5 . once again , we find that in the absence of nearest - neighbor repulsion , the excitation spectra is gapless at @xmath1 and has a maximum at the antiferromagnetic wavevector ( ( @xmath6 ) and equivalent points ) .",
    "as the repulsion is increased , a pronounced peak develops in @xmath4 at these wavevectors and simultaneously a sharp roton minima develops in the spectra .",
    "series extrapolations suggest that the roton gap vanishes when the repulsion term ( @xmath0 ) reaches a value of @xmath7 . however , we are unable to estimate any critical exponents for the vanishing of the gap or for the divergence of the structure factor .",
    "a comparison of our structure factor data with the quantum monte carlo data of wessel and troyer , leads us to suggest that the transition to the supersolid phase maybe weakly first order and occurs for a value of @xmath0 slightly less than @xmath8 .",
    "our calculations also show a near minimum and flat regions in the spectra at the wavevectors ( @xmath9 ) , which correspond to the midpoint of the faces of the brillouin zone . these are points where the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model has a well defined minima.@xcite in our case the dispersion is very flat along some directions and a minimum along others .",
    "there are several distinguishing features in the density of states ( dos ) of the excitation spectra .",
    "the largest maximum in the dos is close to the maximum excitation energy and is not unlike many other antiferromagnets .",
    "but , here , in addition , we get a second maximum in the dos from the flat regions in the spectra at the midpoint of the faces of the brillouin zone and a sharp drop in the dos at the roton energy .",
    "it maybe possible to engineer such hard - core boson systems on a triangular - lattice in cold atomic gases .",
    "it should , then , be possible to excite these collective exciations either optically or by driving the system out of equilibrium .",
    "a measurement of the energies associated with the characteristic features in the density of states can be used to accurately determine the microscopic parameters of the system .",
    "the linked - cluster series expansions performed here involve writing the hamiltonian of interest as @xmath10 where the eigenstates of @xmath11 define the basis to be used and @xmath12 is the perturbation to be applied in a linked cluster expansion .",
    "ground state properties are then obtained as a power series in @xmath13 using raleigh - schrodinger perturbation theory .",
    "excited state properties are obtained following the procedure outlined in @xcite , in which a similarity transformation is obtained in order to block diagonalize the hamiltonian where the ground state sits in a block by itself and the one - particle states form another block . @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an effective hamiltonian for the states which are the perturbatively constructed extensions of the single spin - flip states .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then used to obtain a set of transition amplitudes @xmath16 that describe propagation of the excitation through a distance @xmath17 for the square lattice and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 both even or both odd for the triangular lattice .",
    "these transition amplitudes are used to obtain the transition amplitudes for the bulk lattice by summing over clusters .",
    "fourier transformation of the bulk transition amplitudes then gives the excitation energy in momentum space .",

    "in order to access values of the expansion parameter @xmath13 up to and including @xmath25 , we use standard first order integrated differential approximants @xcite ( idas ) of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27,@xmath28,@xmath29 are polynomials of degree l , m , and t determined uniquely from the expansion coefficients .",
    "when gapless modes are present , estimates of the spin - wave velocity are made using the technique of singh and gelfand@xcite . for small @xmath30",

    "thus the series @xmath37 provides an estimate for @xmath38 , which is the square of the spin - wave velocity .",
    "on the square lattice we perform two distinct types of expansions . for @xmath39",
    ", one can expand directly in @xmath40 by choosing @xmath41    in this case @xmath13 in ( [ perturb ] ) is @xmath42 ( setting @xmath3 ) . since @xmath12 conserves the total @xmath43",
    ", one can perform the computation to high order by restricting the full hilbert space to the total @xmath43 sector of interest , which in this paper will be restricted to total @xmath44 ( half filling ) .",

    "in contrast to the first type of expansion , @xmath12 does not conserve total @xmath43 , and so the entire hilbert space must be used , limiting the order of computation of the series to @xmath45 ( 11 sites ) .",
