    "in many respects , degenerate affine hecke algebras seem to be the key behind the fascinating structure of instanton partition functions of 4d @xmath0 gauge theories .",
    "the spherical hecke central ( shc ) algebra constructed in @xcite is a limit of a symmetrized double degenerate hecke algebra ( ddaha ) .",
    "it acts on instanton partition functions as the kanno - matsuo - zhang ( kmz ) transformation of the young diagrams summand , also called _ bifundamental contribution _ @xcite .",
    "shc representations contain @xmath2 subalgebras which is the main reason behind the agt correspondence @xcite . and",
    "indeed , the various proofs of agt correspondence exploit this underlying algebraic structure .",
    "for instance , a set of ( generalized ) jack polynomials have been used in the proofs @xcite based on the free field representation of cft conformal blocks @xcite .",
    "jack polynomials are known to be the eigenstates of the calogero - moser hamiltonian which is one of the shc generators in the polynomial representation relevant to the formal case of gauge groups @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the shc algebra has a hopf algebra structure , and it is possible to employ the comultiplication to define a representation of the generators relevant to the case of a higher number of colors ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this leads to define generalized jack polynomials which diagonalize the calogero - moser hamiltonian acting in a tensor space @xcite .",
    "the first proof of agt correspondence is also based indirectly on shc .",
    "it uses a specific basis of the cft fock space formed by the aflt states .",
    "these states were defined such that the decomposition of conformal blocks coincides with the expression of nekrasov partition functions @xcite .",
    "they were later identified with the generalized jack polynomials @xcite using the free field construction presented in @xcite .",
    "ddaha , from which shc is constructed , is formed by dunkl operators , and contains an infinite number of commuting integrals of motion .",
    "it has a deep connection with the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite , which may lead to a better understanding of the instanton r - matrix proposed by smirnov @xcite and built upon the stable map introduced in @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in yet another aspect of shc . in @xcite , nekrasov and shatashvili ( ns ) have investigated a limit of the @xmath6-background in which one of the equivariant parameters tends to zero .",
    "they have proposed to express the gauge theory free energy in this limit using the solution of a non - linear integral equation ( nlie ) reminiscent of those derived from the thermodynamical bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "this proposal was confirmed in @xcite , exploiting the mayer cluster expansion technique to perform the subtle limit . in a different study of the ns limit , bethe - like equations and tq - relations",
    "were also obtained @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the associated integrable model bare some similarities with the @xmath7 xxx spin chain , and the system of bosons with delta interaction studied by c. n. yang @xcite .",
    "the latter also describes the solution of the quantum non - linear schrdinger equation in a sector of fixed number of particles , and will be referred shortly as _ qnls_. both integrable models are related to hecke algebras , although in a different way .",
    "xxx spin chains ( with open boundaries ) are known to possess a yangian symmetry , which is a representation of the degenerate affine hecke algebra @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the qnls hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a technique involving dunkl operators . in the case of periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "these operators form with the affine weyl group a ddaha @xcite . in view of these results",
    ", it seems necessary to understand the fate of the shc algebra in the ns limit , and possibly relate it to the algebraic structure of xxx and qnls integrable models .",
    "this paper reports on the first step in this direction .",
    "we focus on a @xmath8 quiver gauge theory with @xmath9 gauge group , @xmath10 fundamental flavors at each node , and a bifundamental matter field .",
    "this theory is asymptotically conformal .",
    "we regard more precisely the bifundamental contribution to the nekrasov instanton partition function .",
    "this quantity depends on two sets of @xmath10 young tableaux , and is a building block for the instanton partition function of more general quivers .",
    "the kmz transformation represents the action of shc generators as a variation of the number of boxes in the young diagrams . in order to proceed to the ns limit",
    ", the action of these generators must be re - written in a suitable manner .",
    "this is done in the second section . in the third section",
    ", we recall the derivation of the bethe - like equations from the invariance of the young diagrams summands under a variation of boxes .",
    "it leads to identify the bethe roots with the instanton positions of the boxes on top of each column .",
    "this identification further provides an expression of the bifundamental contribution .",
    "we then construct a set of operators upon infinitesimal variations of the bethe roots , and show that they obey the shc commutation relations at first order in @xmath1 .",
    "we also recover the kmz transformation in this limit .",
    "finally , in a fourth section , we explain the connection with the outcome of the mayer cluster expansion , and tba - like nlie .",
    "technical details are gathered in the appendices .",
    "the main properties of the shc algebra can be found in @xcite which is the starting point for our rewriting process . in order to render the @xmath1 factors explicit",

    "in particular , the infinitesimal shifts of the bethe roots @xmath350 correspond to a variation of the density @xmath416 which is rendered by a shift of @xmath417 for the hadron of coordinate @xmath418 .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the decomposition of the function @xmath263 over poles , since in the representation @xmath368 this function is a product of essential singularities .",
    "it is still possible to use the cauchy identity to write it as a sum over contributions at the location of the singularities , but the evaluation of the integrals is problematic .",
    "on the other hand , the definition of @xmath238 , diagonal on the states @xmath419 easily follows from the definition [ def_d ] of @xmath121 , and the limit [ dico_kx ] , which gives , taking into account the @xmath1 factor discrepancy in [ d0_series ] between @xmath420 and @xmath421 : @xmath422 this expression can be integrated and expressed in terms of bethe roots using [ id_densities_ii ] .",
    "it leads to the formula [ d0_ur ] used in the previous section .",
    "in this paper , we considered the ns limit of the kmz transformation that represents the action of the shc generators on the bifundamental contribution to the @xmath8 quiver instanton partition function . in this limit",
    ", the bifundamental contribution can be written in terms of two sets of bethe roots .",
    "we have defined a set of generators of degree @xmath423 that exploits an infinitesimal variation of the bethe roots .",
    "these generators reproduce the proper commutation relations , and generates an equivalent of the kmz transformation .",
    "we then turned to an alternative approach that uses the mayer cluster expansion to perform the ns limit .",
    "the coordinates and charges of the hadronic variables that appear in this formalism were formally related to the bethe roots .",
    "this provides a hint on the possibility to realize the kmz transformation directly on integral expressions .",
    "finally , we studied a third expression of the partition function that takes the form of a yang - yang functional .",
    "although obtained via mayer expansion , this expression coincides with the limit of the young tableaux summations under a proper identification of the bethe roots .",
    "we deduced an action of the shc generators on the functional ( at first order in @xmath1 ) .",
    "now that the limit of the algebra has been identified , it remains to relate it to the algebraic structures of the underlying integrable systems , either the yangian of xxx spin chains or the ddaha of qnls .",
    "the connection between shc and the calogero - moser hamiltonian for @xmath4 allows to identify the states @xmath50 with jack polynomials .",
    "it is thus natural to expect a connection between the states @xmath268 and the eigenfunctions of the integrable systems .",
    "such a connection could be obtained using the fact that the calogero - moser cherednik operators reduce to the dunkl operators of qnls in a specific limit @xcite .",
    "this limiting process may be the equivalent of the ns limit from the integrable point of view .",
