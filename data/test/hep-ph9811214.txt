    "the correlation of mean multiplicity with some trigger is the important problem of high energy heavy ion physics .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 suppression can be explained at least partially @xcite by their interactions with co - moving hadrons , and for the numerical calculations we should know the multiplicity of comovers namely in events with @xmath0 production .    in the present paper",
    "we give some results for the dependences of the number of interacting nucleons and the multiplicity of produced secondaries on the impact parameter .",
    "these results are based practically only on geometry , and do not depend on the model of interaction . in the case of minimum bias interactions",
    "the dispersion of the distribution on the number of interacting nucleons ( which is similar to the distributions on the transverse energy , multiplicity of secondaries , etc . ) is very large .",
    "this allows in principle to have a significant dependence of some characteristic of the interaction , say , mean multiplicity of the secondaries , on the used trigger . on the other hand , in the case of central collisions",
    "the discussed dispersion is small that should result in weak dependence on any trigger .",
    "we consider the high energy nucleus - nucleus collision as a superposition of the independent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "so our results can be considered also as a test for search the quark - gluon plasma formation . in the case of any collective interactions ,",
    "including the case of quark - gluon plasma formation we can not see any reason for existance the discussed ratios .",
    "we present an estimation of possible violation which is based on the quark - gluon string fusion calculations .",
    "let us consider the events with secondary hadron production in nuclei a and b minimum bias collisions . in this case the average number of inelastically interacting nucleons of a nucleus a is equal @xcite to    @xmath2    if both nuclei , a and b are heavy enough , the production cross sections of nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions can be written as    @xmath3    and @xmath4 it is evident that in the case of equal nuclei , a = b , @xmath5 so in the case of minimum bias events the average number of interacting nucleons should be four times smaller than in the case of central collisions , where @xmath6 .",
    "for the calculation of the distribution over the number of inelastically ineracting nucleons of a nucleus we will use the rigid target approximation @xcite , which gives the probability of @xmath7 nucleons interaction as @xcite    @xmath8^{a - n_a } [ 1-i(b)]^{n_a } \\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 } \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath10    eq .",
    "( 5 ) is written for minimum bias events . in the case of events for some interval of impact parameter @xmath11 values , the integration in eq .",
    "( 5 ) should be fulfilled by this interval , @xmath12 . in particular , in the case of central collisions the integration should be performed with the condition @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .    the calculated results for averaged values of the number of inelastic interacting nucleons of the projectile nucleus , @xmath15 are presented in fig .",
    "1 , as the functions of impact parameter @xmath11 for the cases of @xmath16 collisions at three different energies ( we define @xmath17 = @xmath18 as the c.m.energy for one nucleon - nucleon pair ) , and for @xmath19 collisions at @xmath18 = 20 gev .",
    "one can see very weak energy dependence of these distributions on the initial energy , which appears in our approach only due to the energy dependence of @xmath20 .    in the case of the collisions of equal heavy ions ( @xmath16 in our case ) at zero impact parameter ,",
    "about 6% of nucleons from every nucleus do not interact inelastically at energy @xmath18 = 18 gev .",
    "more accurate , we obtain on the average 11.8 non - interacting nucleons at this energy , that is in agreement with the value @xmath21 nucleons @xcite , based on the venus 4.12 @xcite model prediction .",
    "the number of non - interacting nucleons decreases to the value about 3% at @xmath18 = 5.5 tev .",
    "this is connected with the fact that the nucleons at the periphery of one nucleus , which are overlapped with the region of small density of nuclear matter at the periphery of another nucleus , have large probability to penetrate without inelastic interaction .",
    "it is clear that this probability decrease with increase of @xmath20 , that results in the presented energy dependence .",
    "the value of @xmath22 decreases with increase of the impact parameter because even at small @xmath23 some regions of colliding ions are not overlapping .    in the case of different ion collisions ,",
    "say @xmath19 , at small impact parameters all nucleons of light nucleus go throw the regions of relatively high nuclear matter density of heavy nucleus , so practically all these nucleons interact inelastically .",
    "for the case of @xmath19 interactions at @xmath18 = 20 gev it is valid for @xmath24 fm .",
    "it is interesting to consider the distributions on the number of inelastically interacting nucleons at different impact parameters .",
    "the calculated probabilities to find the given numbers of inelastically interacting nucleons for the case of minimum bias @xmath16 events are presented in fig .",
    "the average value , @xmath15 = 50.4 is in reasonable agreement with eq .",
    "the disagreement of the order of 3% can be connected with different values of effective nuclear radii in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the dispersion of the distribution on @xmath25 is very large .",
    "the results of the same calculations for different regions of impact parameters are presented in fig .",
    "2b , where we compare the cases of the central ( @xmath26 fm ) , peripheral ( 12 fm @xmath27 13 fm ) and intermediate ( 6 fm @xmath27 7 fm ) collisions .",
    "one can see that the dispersions of all these distributions are many times smaller in comparison with the minimum bias case , fig .",
    "2a .    in the cases of the central and peripheral interactions ,",
    "the distributions over @xmath25 are significantly more narrow than in the intermediate case .",
    "the reason is that in the case of central collision the number of nucleons at the periphery on one nucleus , which have the probabilities to interact or not of the same order , is small enough . in the case of very peripheral collision",
    "the total number of nucleons which can interact is small .",
    "however , in the intermediate case the comparatively large number of nucleons of one nucleus go via peripheral region of another nucleus with small nuclear matter density , and every of these nucleons can interacts or not .",
    "let us consider now the multiplicity of the produced secondaries in the central region .",
    "first of all , it should be proportional to the number of interacting nucleons of projectile nucleus .",
    "it should depends also on the average number , @xmath28 , of inelastic interactions of every projectile nucleon with the target nucleus . at asymptotically",
    "high energies the mean multiplicity of secondaries produced in nucleon - nucleus collision should be proportional to @xmath29 @xcite . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the average number of interactions in the case of central nucleon - nucleus collisions , @xmath30 , is approximately 1.5 times larger than in the case of minimum bias nucleon - nucleus collisions , @xmath31 .",
    "it means that the mean multiplicity of any secondaries in the central heavy ion collisions ( with a = b ) , @xmath32 should be approximately 6 times larger than in the case of minimum bias collisions of the same nuclei , @xmath33 , @xmath34 . of course ,",
    "this estimations is valid only for secondaries in the central region of inclusive spectra .",
    "there exist several corrections to the obtained result . at existing fixed target energies the multiplicity of secondaries is proportional not to @xmath35 , but to @xmath36 @xcite . for heavy nuclei",
    "the values of @xmath31 are about @xmath37 .",
    "it means , that the @xmath38 to @xmath39 ratio equal to 1.5 will results in enhancement factor about 1.4 for the multiplicity of secondaries .",
    "more important correction comes from the fact that in the case of central collision of two nuclei with the same atomic weights , only a part of projectile nucleons can interact with the central region of the target nucleus .",
    "it decrease the discussed enhancement factor to , say , 1.2 . as it was presented in the previous sect .",
    ", even in central collisions ( with zero impact parameter ) of equal heavy nuclei , several percents of projectile nucleons do not interact with the target because they are moving through the diffusive region of the target nucleus with very small density of nuclear matter .    as a result",
    "we can estimate our prediction @xmath40    in the case of quark - gluon plasma formation or some another collective effects we can not see the reason for such predictions . for example , the calculation of @xmath41 and @xmath42 with account the string fusion effect @xcite violate eq .",
    "( 8) on the level of 40% for the case of @xmath43 collisions at rhic energies .",
    "moreover , in the conventional approach considered here , we obtain the prediction of eq .",
    "( 8) for any sort of secondaries including pions , kaons , @xmath0 , drell - yan pairs , direct photons , etc .",
    "let us imagine that the quark - gluon plasma formation is possible only at comparatively small impact parameters ( i.e. in the central interactions ) . in this case eq .",
    "( 8) can be strongly violated , say , for direct photons and , possibly , for light mass drell - yan pairs , due to the additional contribution to their multiplicity in the central events via thermal mechanism . at the same time , eq .",
    "( 8) can be valid , say , for pions , if the most part of them is produced at the late stage of the process , after decay of the plasma state .",
    "so the violation of eq .",
    "( 8) for the particles which can be emitted from the plasma state should be considered as a signal for quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "of course , the effects of final state interactions , etc . should be accounted for in such test .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the main contribution to the dispersion of multiplicity distribution in the case of heavy ion collisions comes from the dispersion in the number of nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the last number is in strong correlation with the value of impact parameter .    for the normalized dispersion @xmath44 , where @xmath45 we have @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon interactions in nucleus - nucleus collision , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the average multiplicity and the dispersion in one nucleon - nucleon collision .    in the case of heavy ion collisions @xmath50 , so the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 9 ) becomes negligible @xcite , and the first term , which is the relative dispersion in the number of nucleon - nucleon interactions , dominates . in the case of minimum bias a - b",
    "interaction the last dispersion is comparatively large due to large dispersion in the distribution on @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "so in the case of some trigger ( say , @xmath0 production ) without fixing of the impact parameter , the multiplicity of secondaries can change significantly in comparison with its average value . in the case of some narrow region of impact parameters the dispersion in the distribution on @xmath7",
    "is many times smaller , as one can see in fig . 2b , especially in the case of central collisions .",
    "the dispersion in the number of inelastic interactions of one projectile nucleon with the target nucleus , @xmath51 , should be the same or slightly smaller in comparison with the minimum bias case .",
    "so the dispersion in the multiplicity of secondaries can not be large .",
    "it means that any trigger can not change significantly the average multiplicity of secondaries in the central heavy ion collisions , even if this trigger strongly influents on the multiplicity in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we calculated the distributions on the number of interacting nucleons in heavy ion collisions as the functions of impact parameters .",
    "the dispersions of these distributions are very small for the central and very peripheral interactions and significantly larger for intermediate values of impact parameters .",
    "we estimated also the ratio of mean multiplicities of secondaries in minimum bias and central collisions , which can be used for search of quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "we presented that in the case of central collisions any trigger can not change significantly ( say , more than 10 - 15% ) the average multiplicity .",
    "this fact can be used experimentally to distinguish collective effects on @xmath0 production like quark - gluon plasma from more conventional machanisms .    in conclusion",
