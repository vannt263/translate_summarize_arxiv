    "topological insulators ( tis ) are bulk insulating materials which exhibit perfect metallic conductivity on their boundary via electronic edge ( in 2d tis ) or surface states ( in 3d tis ) that are guaranteed by the topological character of the bulk band structure @xcite .",
    "electrons in these boundary states are highly spin - polarized and their spin and momentum is locked to each other by spin - orbit coupling , creating helical spin textures and making tis highly attractive for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects of 3d tis is the fact that their surface inevitably hosts these metallic surface states as long as the symmetry defining the topological character is not destroyed @xcite . in a strong topological insulator ( sti ) , for instance , time - reversal symmetry protects these states on all surfaces .",
    "weak topological insulators ( wtis ) , on the other hand , display protected metallicity only at surfaces with a certain orientation , while other surfaces remain insulating . the latter can be understood in a simple picture , where a stack of two - dimensional tis forms a wti with metallic edge states inherited from the 2d ti but with an insulating surface plane ( the dark side  ) normal to the stacking direction . finally , in topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) , where the symmetry with respect to a mirror plane defines the topology , the metallic surface states can be found on surfaces perpendicular to these mirror planes @xcite .",
    "+ for the case of @xmath1 it was already shown that a single compound can belong both to the class of strong tis and tcis @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to think of the possibilities opened by symmetry breaking that can destroy certain surface states while keeping others intact .",
    "for example one could imagine a material that is both a wti and a tci and has all surfaces covered with metallic edge states , where the mirror plane of the tci is normal to the dark side of the wti .",
    "then , a magnetic field would destroy the topological protection of the states originating from the topological properties that define the wti , while the mirror - symmetry protected states remain intact ; likewise , small structural distortions can destroy the mirror plane without affecting the edge states arising from time - reversal symmetry .",
    "+ in the search for such a material , we start from @xmath1 with the above mentioned properties and from the bi bilayer that is known to be a 2d ti @xcite .",
    "it is possible to produce natural superlattices @xmath6_{x}[\\mathrm{bi}_{2}\\mathrm{te}_{3}]_{y}$ ] from hexagonal , metallic bi bilayer ( bls ) and semiconducting @xmath1 quintuple layer ( qls ) building blocks in a wide range of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . while @xmath1 consists of only ql building blocks , the unit cell of @xmath2 phase",
    "is made out of a stacking sequence of a single bl interleaved with two subsequent qls .",
    "the size of the unit cell along the stacking direction , i.e. the @xmath9 lattice constant , varies quite severely among the different stable compounds , which makes them easily distinguishable in a diffraction experiment .",
    "recently , @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) was investigated in some detail and characterized as topological semimetal @xcite . for practical applications , however , an insulating bulk material is preferable .",
    "+   + in this article , we identify the stoichiometric natural superlattice @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) as a semiconductor with a small bandgap of about @xmath13{ev}$ ] with the desired properties : @xmath2 is both a wti and a tci where the combination of both properties leads to topologically protected surface states ( tss ) on all sides of the crystal . our density functional theory ( dft )",
    "calculations predict a @xmath14 class of @xmath15 and a mirror chern number @xmath4 .",
    "we find two characteristic surface states of the tci on the ( 0001 ) surface , regardless of the surface termination .",
    "a very similar situation has been reported recently for @xmath16 , theoretically @xcite .",
    "+ we demonstrate that @xmath2 can be grown in form of high quality thin films on si(111 ) by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "its layered structure is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) and x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , confirming a repeated stacking sequence of 2ql of @xmath1 and a single bi bl .",
    "we investigate the electronic structure of @xmath2 by means of spin- and angle - resolved photoemission ( spin - arpes ) .",
    "the experimental results are compared to the well known prototypical 3d sti @xmath1 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "spin - arpes reveals that in @xmath2 the surface states close to @xmath19 exhibit a nearly vanishing spin polarization in contrast to the time - reversal symmetry driven tss in @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , our spectra taken along non - high - symmetry lines reveal band crossings at non - time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) points that can be associated with surface states protected by mirror symmetry and the tci character of @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig : bulk](a ) depicts a schematic model of the crystal structure of @xmath2 , indicating te ( green ) and bi ( orange ) atoms as well as one unit cell defined by the lattice constant @xmath9 along the stacking direction .",
    "the separation of the layered structure into qls and bi bls is marked .",
    "the bulk band structure of @xmath2 in the relaxed structural geometry is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](b ) .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is included in this calculation and the color represents the localization of the electronic states at the bl ( green ) or at the ql ( red ) . as one can see , there are no states at the fermi level @xmath20 , reflecting the insulating character with an energy gap of @xmath21{mev}$ ] .",
    "the states around the fermi level alternate between bl- and ql - related , where the highest occupied levels at the time - reversal invariant momenta @xmath22 and a stem from qls ( red ) , while the lowest unoccupied states originate from the bl ( green ) , and vice versa for the m and l points .",
    "since the crystal possesses spatial inversion symmetry , the parity of the states can be calculated and the topological index @xmath14 can be deduced according to ref .",
    "@xcite based on the product of the parities of all occupied bands at the eight trims , i.e. , one at @xmath22 , one at a , three at m , and three at l. the result is shown in fig .",

    "+   + it is tempting to relate the wti property to the fact that both , the bi bilayer and the 2qls @xmath1 are 2d tis such that the wti results from a simple stacking of 2d tis in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "however , our band structure calculations in fig . [ fig : bulk](d ) , introducing artificially expanded distances between the bl and the qls , show a more complex scenario : if the bl is sufficiently separated from the 2qls , the states can be decomposed in contributions from the two components ( green = bi bl and red = 2qls , respectively ) .",
    "but , due to charge transfer , the inverted gap of the bl is shifted above the fermi level and , accordingly , some of the 2ql @xmath1 conduction band states are below @xmath25 .",
    "only the hybridization of the bl states with the ql states opens up the gap that leads to the insulating bulk structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](b ) , as can be nicely deduced from the changing color of the bands along the @xmath26-directions .",

    "the size of the symbols corresponds to the spin - polarization in the first four layers of a slab , the color ( red / blue ) indicates the orientation of the spins with respect to a direction perpendicular to the momentum and surface normal . ]",
    "next , we want to examine the surface bandstructure on the @xmath29 surface , which heavily depends on the precise surface termination . due to the layered crystal structure and",

    "figure [ fig : surface dft ] depicts the spin - resolved surface bandstructure for the respective terminations . in all cases",
    "an even number of fermi level crossings is found in @xmath5 direction , while along @xmath30 a bandgap between valence- and conduction band is formed ( although it can be very small ) .",
    "we see that , although there are surface states , the bandstructure is compatible with a wti phase .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the bands along @xmath5 show a band crossing for all possible terminations , reminiscent of dirac - like cones observed in topological crystalline insulators .",
    "additional evidence that this crossing is protected by a mirror symmetry in the crystal comes from the observation that the crossing is lifted when the surface atoms are displaced in @xmath31 $ ] direction , breaking this symmetry ( not shown here ) .",
    "+ to check for the possibility that @xmath2 is a tci , we determined the mirror chern number of the bulk phase . in the @xmath32 plane in reciprocal space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](c ) ) all bloch states can be distinguished by their eigenvalues with respect to a mirror operation in the @xmath33 plane . to calculate their corresponding berry phases as well as the chern numbers , we construct a tight - binding hamiltonian based on the maximally localized wannier functions .",

    "[ fig : surface dft ] in more detail .",

    "the steeply dispersing bands near @xmath41 , crossing at @xmath43{ev}$ ] , are a characteristic feature that is also observed for a bi - rich termination of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ql - terminated surface ( center panel of fig . [",
