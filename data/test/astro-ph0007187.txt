    "in this review i will concentrate on the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the other key questions in cosmology today concern the nature of the dark matter and dark energy , the origin and nature of the primordial inhomogeneities , and the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "i have been telling my theoretical cosmology students for several years that these latter topics are their main subjects for research , since determining the values of the cosmological parameters is now mainly in the hands of the observers .    in discussing cosmological parameters",
    ", it will be useful to distinguish between two sets of assumptions : ( a ) general relativity plus the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales ( friedmann - robertson - walker framework ) , or ( b ) the frw framework plus the  family of models . in addition to the frw framework , the  models assume that the present matter density @xmath3 plus the cosmological constant ( or its equivalent in `` dark energy '' ) in units of critical density @xmath13 sum to unity ( @xmath14 ) to produce the flat universe predicted by simple cosmic inflation models .",
    "these  models assume that the primordial fluctuations were adiabatic ( all components fluctuate together ) and gaussian , and had a zeldovich spectrum ( @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ) , and that the dark matter is mostly of the cold variety .",
    "although the results from the long - duration boomerang @xcite and the maxima-1 @xcite cmb observations and analyses @xcite were were not yet available at the dark matter 2000 conference , i have made use of them in preparing this review .",
    "the table below summarizes the current observational information about the cosmological parameters , with estimated @xmath17 errors .",
    "the quantities in brackets have been deduced using at least some of the  assumptions .",
    "the rest of this paper discusses these issues in more detail .",
    "but it should already be apparent that there is impressive agreement between the values of the parameters determined by various methods .",
    "the strongest lower limits for @xmath2 come from studies of the stellar populations of globular clusters ( gcs ) . in the mid-1990s",
    "the best estimates of the ages of the oldest gcs from main sequence turnoff magnitudes were @xmath18 gyr @xcite .",
    "a frequently quoted lower limit on the age of gcs was @xmath19 gyr @xcite , which was then an even more conservative lower limit on @xmath20 , where @xmath21 gyr is the time from the big bang until gc formation .",
    "the main uncertainty in the gc age estimates came from the uncertain distance to the gcs : a 0.25 magnitude error in the distance modulus translates to a 22% error in the derived cluster age @xcite .    in spring of 1997",
    ", analyses of data from the hipparcos astrometric satellite indicated that the distances to gcs assumed in obtaining the ages just discussed were systematically underestimated @xcite .",
    "it follows that their stars at the main sequence turnoff are brighter and therefore younger .",
    "stellar evolution calculation improvements also lowered the gc age estimates . in light of the new hipparcos data , chaboyer et al .",
    "@xcite have done a revised monte carlo analysis of the effects of varying various uncertain parameters , and obtained @xmath22 gyr ( @xmath17 ) , with a 95% c.l .",
    "lower limit of 9.5 gyr .",
    "the latest detailed analysis @xcite gives @xmath23 gyr from main sequence fitting using parallaxes of local subdwarfs , the method used in @xcite .",
    "these authors get somewhat smaller gc distances when all the available data is used , with a resulting @xmath24 gyr ( 95% c.l . )",
    ". however , if main sequence fitting is the more reliable method , the younger age may be more appropriate .",
    "stellar age estimates are of course based on stellar evolution calculations , which have also improved significantly .",
    "but the solar neutrino problem reminds us that we are not really sure that we understand how even our nearest star operates ; and the sun plays an important role in calibrating stellar evolution , since it is the only star whose age we know independently ( from radioactive dating of early solar system material ) .",
    "an important check on stellar ages can come from observations of white dwarfs in globular and open clusters @xcite .",
    "what if the gc age estimates are wrong for some unknown reason ?",
    "the only other non - cosmological estimates of the age of the universe come from nuclear cosmochronometry  radioactive decay and chemical evolution of the galaxy  and white dwarf cooling .",
    "cosmochronometry age estimates are sensitive to a number of uncertain issues such as the formation history of the disk and its stars , and possible actinide destruction in stars @xcite .",
    "however , an independent cosmochronometry age estimate of @xmath25 gyr has been obtained based on data from two low - metallicity stars , using the measured radioactive depletion of thorium ( whose half - life is 14.2 gyr ) compared to stable heavy r - process elements @xcite .",
    "this method could become very important if it were possible to obtain accurate measurements of r - process element abundances for a number of very low metallicity stars giving consistent age estimates , and especially if the large errors could be reduced .",
    "independent age estimates come from the cooling of white dwarfs in the neighborhood of the sun .",
    "the key observation is that there is a lower limit to the luminosity , and therefore also the temperature , of nearby white dwarfs ; although dimmer ones could have been seen , none have been found ( cf",
    ". however @xcite ) .",
    "the only plausible explanation is that the white dwarfs have not had sufficient time to cool to lower temperatures , which initially led to an estimate of @xmath26 gyr for the age of the galactic disk @xcite . since there was evidence , based on the pre - hipparcos gc distances , that the stellar disk of our galaxy is about 2 gyr younger than the oldest gcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this in turn gave an estimate of the age of the universe of @xmath27 gyr .",
    "other analyses @xcite conclude that sensitivity to disk star formation history , and to effects on the white dwarf cooling rates due to c / o separation at crystallization and possible presence of trace elements such as @xmath28ne , allow a rather wide range of ages for the disk of about @xmath29 gyr .",
    "one determination of the white dwarf luminosity function , using white dwarfs in proper motion binaries , leads to a somewhat lower minimum luminosity and therefore a somewhat higher estimate of the age of the disk of @xmath30 gyr @xcite .",
    "more recent observations @xcite and analyses @xcite lead to an estimated age of the galactic disk of @xmath31 gyr .",
    "we conclude that @xmath7 gyr , with @xmath32 gyr a likely lower limit .",
    "note that @xmath33 gyr implies that @xmath34 for matter density @xmath35 , and that @xmath36 even for @xmath37 as small as 0.3 in flat cosmologies ( i.e. , with @xmath38 ) .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath40 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 remains uncertain , although no longer by the traditional factor of two .",
    "the range of @xmath41 determinations has been shrinking with time @xcite .",
    "de  vaucouleurs long contended that @xmath42 .",
    "sandage has long contended that @xmath43 , although a recent reanalysis of the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data coauthored by sandage and tammann @xcite concludes that the latest data are consistent with @xmath44 .",
    "the hubble parameter has been measured in two basic ways : ( 1 ) measuring the distance to some nearby galaxies , typically by measuring the periods and luminosities of cepheid variables in them ; and then using these `` calibrator galaxies '' to set the zero point in any of the several methods of measuring the relative distances to galaxies .",
    "( 2 ) using fundamental physics to measure the distance to some distant object(s ) directly , thereby avoiding at least some of the uncertainties of the cosmic distance ladder @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with method ( 1 ) was that there was only a handful of calibrator galaxies close enough for cepheids to be resolved in them .",
    "however , the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale has significantly increased the set of calibrator galaxies .",
    "the difficulty with method ( 2 ) is that in every case studied so far , some aspect of the observed system or the underlying physics remains somewhat uncertain .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that the results of several different methods of type ( 2 ) are rather similar , and indeed not very far from those of method ( 1 ) .",
    "this gives reason to hope for convergence .",
    "one piece of good news is that the several methods of measuring the relative distances to galaxies now mostly seem to be consistent with each other .",
    "these methods use either `` standard candles '' or empirical relations between two measurable properties of a galaxy , one distance - independent and the other distance - dependent .",
    "the favorite standard candle is sne ia , and observers are now in good agreement . taking account of an empirical relationship between the sne ia light curve shape and maximum luminosity leads to @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 @xcite , or @xmath47 @xcite , and the slightly lower value mentioned above from the latest analysis coauthored by sandage and tammann agrees within the errors .",
    "the hst key project result using sne ia is @xmath48 , where the first error quoted is statistical and the second is systematic @xcite , and their cepheid metallicity - dependent luminosity - period relationship @xcite has been used ( this lowers @xmath41 by 4% ) . some of the other relative distance methods are based on old stellar populations : the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) , the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) , and the surface brightness fluctuation method ( sbf ) .",
    "the hst key project result using these old star standard candles is @xcite @xmath49 , including the cepheid metallicity correction .",
    "the old favorite empirical relation used as a relative distance indicator is the tully - fisher relation between the rotation velocity and luminosity of spiral galaxies .",
    "the `` final '' value of the hubble constant from the hst key project taking all of these into account , including the metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity relation , is @xcite @xmath50 , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic . the largest source of systematic uncertainty is the distance to the lmc , which is here assumed to have a distance modulus of 18.45 .",
    "this is a significantly higher @xmath41 than their previous @xcite @xmath51 , or @xmath52 including the cepheid metallicity dependence , using a lmc distance modulus of 18.5 .",
    "the fundamental physics approaches involve either type ia or type ii supernovae , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect , or gravitational lensing of quasars .",
    "all are promising , but in each case the relevant physics remains somewhat uncertain .    the @xmath53ni radioactivity method for determining @xmath39 using type ia sne avoids the uncertainties of the distance ladder by calculating the absolute luminosity of type ia supernovae from first principles using plausible but as yet unproved physical models for @xmath53ni production .",
    "the first result obtained was that @xmath54 @xcite ; however , another study @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) found that uncertainties in extinction ( i.e. , light absorption ) toward each supernova increases the range of allowed @xmath41 .",
    "demanding that the @xmath53ni radioactivity method agree with an expanding photosphere approach leads to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the expanding photosphere method compares the expansion rate of the sn envelope measured by redshift with its size increase inferred from its temperature and magnitude .",
    "this approach was first applied to type ii sne ; the 1992 result @xmath56 @xcite was subsequently revised upward by the same authors to @xmath57 @xcite . however , there are various complications with the physics of the expanding envelope @xcite .",
    "the s - z effect is the compton scattering of microwave background photons from the hot electrons in a foreground galaxy cluster .",
    "this can be used to measure @xmath39 since properties of the cluster gas measured via the s - z effect and from x - ray observations have different dependences on @xmath39 .",
    "the result from the first cluster for which sufficiently detailed data was available , a665 ( at @xmath58 ) , was @xmath59 @xcite ; combining this with data on a2218 ( @xmath60 ) raised this somewhat to @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the history and more recent data have been reviewed by birkinshaw @xcite , who concludes that the available data give a hubble parameter @xmath62 with a scatter of about 0.2 .",
    "but since the available measurements are not independent , it does not follow that @xmath56 ; for example , there is a selection effect that biases low the @xmath41 determined this way .",
    "several quasars have been observed to have multiple images separated by @xmath63 a few arc seconds ; this phenomenon is interpreted as arising from gravitational lensing of the source quasar by a galaxy along the line of sight ( first suggested by @xcite ; reviewed in @xcite ) . in the first such system",
    "discovered , qso 0957 + 561 ( @xmath64 ) , the time delay @xmath65 between arrival at the earth of variations in the quasar s luminosity in the two images has been measured to be , e.g. , @xmath66 days @xcite , although other authors found a value of @xmath67 days @xcite .",
    "the shorter @xmath65 has now been confirmed @xcite .",
    "since @xmath68 , this observation allows an estimate of the hubble parameter .",
    "the latest results for @xmath41 from 0957 + 561 , using all available data , are @xmath69 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "@xcite , and @xmath70 @xcite , where the error does not include systematic errors in the assumed form of the lensing mass distribution .",
    "the first quadruple - image quasar system discovered was pg1115 + 080 . using a recent series of observations ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 ) , the time delay between images b and c has been determined to be about @xmath71 days .",
    "a simple model for the lensing galaxy and the nearby galaxies then leads to @xmath72 ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 ) , although higher values for @xmath41 are obtained by more sophisticated analyses : @xmath73 @xcite , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the results depend on how the lensing galaxy and those in the compact group of which it is a part are modelled .",
    "another quadruple - lens system , b1606 + 656 , leads to @xmath75 , where the first error is the 95% c.l . statistical error , and the second is the estimated systematic uncertainty @xcite .",
    "time delays have also recently been determined for the einstein ring system b0218 + 357 , giving @xmath76 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "mainly because of the systematic uncertainties in modelling the mass distribution in the lensing systems , the uncertainty in the @xmath41 determination by gravitational lens time delays remains rather large .",
    "but it is reassuring that this completely independent method gives results consistent with the other determinations .      to summarize , relative distance methods favor a value @xmath77 .",
    "meanwhile the fundamental physics methods typically lead to @xmath78 . among fundamental physics approaches ,",
    "there has been important recent progress in measuring @xmath41 via the sunyev - zeldovich effect and time delays between different images of gravitationally lensed quasars , although the uncertainties remain larger than via relative distance methods . for the rest of this review",
    ", we will adopt a value of @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath80 gyr for @xmath35  probably too low compared to the ages of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "but for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , or alternatively for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 gyr , in agreement with the globular cluster estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "this is one of the weakest of the several arguments for low @xmath3 , a non - zero cosmological constant , or both .",
    "the recent atmospheric neutrino data from super - kamiokande @xcite provide strong evidence of neutrino oscillations and therefore of non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "these data imply a lower limit on the hot dark matter ( i.e. , light neutrino ) contribution to the cosmological density @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath5 is actually that low , and therefore cosmologically uninteresting , if @xmath87 , as is suggested by the hierarchical pattern of the quark and charged lepton masses .",
    "but if the @xmath88 and @xmath89 are nearly degenerate in mass , as suggested by their strong mixing , then @xmath5 could be substantially larger .",
    "although the cold + hot dark matter ( chdm ) cosmological model with @xmath90 , @xmath35 , and @xmath91 predicts power spectra of cosmic density and cmb anisotropies that are in excellent agreement with the data @xcite , as we have just seen the large value measured for the hubble parameter makes such @xmath35 models dubious .",
    "it remains to be seen whether including a significant amount of hot dark matter in low-@xmath3 models improves their agreement with data .",
    "primack & gross @xcite found that the possible improvement of the low-@xmath3 flat ( ) cosmological models with the addition of light neutrinos appears to be rather limited , and the maximum amount of hot dark matter decreases with decreasing @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath92 , @xcite find that @xmath93 ; @xcite finds more restrictive upper limits with the constraint that the primordial power spectrum index @xmath94 , but this may not be well motivated .",
    "the strongest evidence for a positive @xmath95 comes from high - redshift sne ia , and independently from a combination of observations indicating that @xmath96 together with cmb data indicating that the universe is nearly flat .",
    "we will discuss these observations in the next section . here",
    "we will start by looking at other constraints on @xmath95 .",
    "the cosmological effects of a cosmological constant are not difficult to understand @xcite . in the early universe , the density of energy and matter is far more important than the @xmath95 term on the r.h.s . of the friedmann equation .",
    "but the average matter density decreases as the universe expands , and at a rather low redshift ( @xmath97 for @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) the @xmath95 term finally becomes dominant . around this redshift",
    ", the @xmath95 term almost balances the attraction of the matter , and the scale factor @xmath100 increases very slowly , although it ultimately starts increasing exponentially as the universe starts inflating under the influence of the increasingly dominant @xmath95 term .",
    "the existence of a period during which expansion slows while the clock runs explains why @xmath2 can be greater than for @xmath101 , but this also shows that there is an increased likelihood of finding galaxies in the redshift interval when the expansion slowed , and a correspondingly increased opportunity for lensing by these galaxies of quasars ( which mostly lie at higher redshift @xmath102 ) .",
    "the observed frequency of such optical lensed quasars is about what would be expected in a standard @xmath103 , @xmath101 cosmology , so this data sets fairly stringent upper limits : @xmath104 at 90% c.l .",
    "@xcite , with more recent data giving even tighter constraints : @xmath105 at 95% confidence if @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "this limit could perhaps be weakened if there were ( a ) significant extinction by dust in the e / s0 galaxies responsible for the lensing or ( b ) rapid evolution of these galaxies , but there is much evidence that these galaxies have little dust and have evolved only passively for @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "an alternative analysis @xcite of some of the same optical lensing data gives a value @xmath108 .",
    "my group @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) showed that edge - on disk galaxies can lens quasars very effectively , and discussed a case in which optical extinction is significant . but the radio observations discussed by @xcite , which give a @xmath109 limit @xmath110 , are not affected by extinction , so those are the ones quoted in the table above . recently a reanalysis @xcite of lensing using new models of the evolution of elliptical galaxies gave @xmath111 , but kochanek et al .",
    "@xcite ( see especially fig .",
    "4 ) show that the available evidence disfavors such models .",
    "a model - dependent constraint appeared to come from simulations of @xmath95cdm @xcite and opencdm @xcite cobe - normalized models with @xmath112 , @xmath98 , and either @xmath99 or , for the open case , @xmath82 .",
    "these models have too much power on small scales to be consistent with observations , unless there is strong scale - dependent antibiasing of galaxies with respect to dark matter . however , recent high - resolution simulations @xcite find that merging and destruction of galaxies in dense environments lead to exactly the sort of scale - dependent antibiasing needed for agreement with observations for the  model .",
    "similar results have been found using simulations plus semi - analytic methods @xcite ( but cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another constraint on @xmath95 from simulations is a claim @xcite that the number of long arcs in clusters is in accord with observations for an open cdm model with @xmath98 but an order of magnitude too low in a  model with the same @xmath3 .",
    "this apparently occurs because clusters with dense cores form too late in such models .",
    "this is potentially a powerful constraint , and needs to be checked and understood .",
    "it is now known that including cluster galaxies does not alter these results @xcite .",
    "the present author , like many theorists , has long regarded the einstein - de sitter ( @xmath35 , @xmath101 ) cosmology as the most attractive one . for one thing , of the three possible constant values for @xmath113",

    "also , cosmic inflation is the only known solution for several otherwise intractable problems , and all simple inflationary models predict that the universe is flat , i.e. that @xmath115 . since there is no known physical reason for a non - zero cosmological constant , it was often said that inflation favors @xmath103 .",
    "of course , theoretical prejudice is not a reliable guide . in recent years",

    "a new measurement @xmath160 comes from the amplitude of the power spectrum of fluctuations at redshift @xmath161 , measured from the lyman @xmath162 forest @xcite .",
    "this result is strongly inconsistent with high-@xmath3 models because they would predict that the fluctuations grow much more to @xmath163 , and thus would be lower at @xmath164 than they are observed to be .",
    "we thus end up with a picture of the distribution of the density of energy density in a flat universe represented by figure 1 @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking things about the present era in cosmology is the remarkable agreement between the values of the cosmological densities and the other cosmological parameters obtained by different methods  except possibly for the quasar lensing data which favors a higher @xmath3 and lower @xmath6 , and the arc lensing data which favors lower values of both parameters .",
    "if the results from the new cmb measurements end up agreeing with those from the other methods discussed above , the cosmological parameters will have been determined to perhaps 10% , and cosmologists can focus their attention on the other subjects that i mentioned at the beginning : origin of the initial fluctuations , the nature of the dark matter and dark energy , and the formation of galaxies and large - scale structure .",
    "cosmologists can also speculate on the reasons why the cosmological parameters have the values that they do , but this appears to be the sort of question whose answer may require a deeper understanding of fundamental physics  perhaps from a superstring theory of everything .",
