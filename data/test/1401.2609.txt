    "in recent years , scaling limits of nonlinear and/or singular functionals of stochastic lattice models have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "just to give a couple of examples , we mention the extensive studies of the kpz universality class ( see @xcite for a review ) and gaussian multiplicative chaos associated to liouiville quantum gravity ( see @xcite for a review ) . in @xcite",
    "the author has proposed a general framework ( the so - called theory of _ regularity structures _ ) in order to deal with ill - posed stochastic pde s on which the trouble comes from a nonlinear term ( like in the kpz or stochastic allen - cahn equations ) or from a singular linear term ( like in the parabolic anderson model ) .",
    "the theory of regularity structures allows to make sense of troublesome equations in a meaningful way .",
    "moreover , various scaling limits of stochastic lattice models on which these singular and/or nonlinear observables play an important role should be given in terms of solutions to these equations .",
    "however , aside from models on which a great deal of integrability is present ( the term _ stochastic integrability _ was coined in @xcite ) , the question of convergence of nonlinear fluctuations of stochastic lattice models is basically open ; see however @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients of the theory of regularity structures consists in making sense _ a priori _ of enough nonlinear and/or singular observables of solutions of _ linear _ stochastic pde s . in the case of the kpz equation @xcite ,",
    "one starts with the solution of the ornstein - uhlenbeck equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a space - time white noise and tries to make sense of various nonlinear functionals of it ( the twelve tree - labeled processes in @xcite ) . to avoid uncomfortable issues arising from the lack of compactness",
    ", @xcite restricts himself to the circle @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest of these processes corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath4 turns out to be a distribution , it is far from clear how to define @xmath3 .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the stationary situation , on which for any fixed time @xmath5 , @xmath4 is a spatial white noise of variance @xmath6 .",
    "the simplest choice should be to take an approximation of the identity @xmath7 centered at @xmath8 , and to consider @xmath3 as the limit of @xmath9 as @xmath10 in some sense .",
    "it turns out that this plan can be formalized after a wick renormalization : when integrated in time and space against a smooth test function , @xmath11 has a meaningful limit as @xmath12 . of course ,",
    "if one wants to use @xcite in order to obtain a unique solution of the kpz equation , there are still 11 processes to go , but on this paper we just focus on this one process ( we don _ not _ claim we can treat the other 11 processes ! ) . up to our knowledge , this _ squared field _ was first considered in @xcite , where the convergence of space - time fluctuations of two - point functions to the squared field of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process was obtained .",
    "a more general , different proof was implicitly obtained in @xcite and explicitly stated in @xcite , as a part of a program towards the derivation of the kpz equation from general stochastic lattice models .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new , different approach in order to define the field @xmath3 .",
    "the _ quadratic field _ associated to @xmath4 is the two - dimensional process formally defined as @xmath13 . in order to define this object in a weak sense ,",
    "some care needs to be taken at the diagonal ; the simplest choice is to take @xmath14 ( anyway @xmath15 is just a formal object ) . blindly applying it s formula",
    "we see that @xmath15 satisfies an equation of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a distribution - valued martingale that can be computed in terms of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath4 and the noise @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that this equation is well - posed and solutions of it can be constructed straightforwardly .",
    "let @xmath19 be a two - dimensional approximation of the identity .",
    "let @xmath20 be a mean - zero , regular function and consider the process @xmath21 it turns out that the process @xmath22 has a non - trivial limit as @xmath12 and this limit coincides with the squared process @xmath3 constructed in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that now we obtain the squared process as a singular _ linear _ observable of the solution of a reasonably well - behaved stochastic pde .",
    "the main advantage of this representation is that solving a simple laplace problem , we can obtain various properties of the squared process in a more or less straightforward way .    in",
    "order keep the paper at a reasonable length , we focus on two issues about the quadratic field @xmath15 and we keep the model as simple as possible . first we show that the quadratic fluctuations of the simple exclusion process converge to the quadratic field @xmath15 . it is well known that the simple exclusion process is integrable in the sense that various quantities of interest , among them @xmath23-point correlation functions , can be computed almost explicitly .",
    "we do _ not _ take full advantage of this feature .",
    "given the technical boltzmann - gibbs principle for granted , a careful reading of our proof shows that this convergence result can be extended for the speed - change exclusion processes considered in @xcite .",
    "this technical principle has been proved in @xcite .",
    "and then we obtain short - time and long - time properties of the process @xmath24 , using the construction outlined above .",
    "these properties have not been obtained before , and they are good examples of the advantages of our construction with respect to previous ones .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ]",
    "we define the exclusion process and we define the various fluctuation fields we want to study on this article . on the way , we provide various topological definitions which are needed to handle distribution - valued processes .",
    "we also state the main results of the article . in section [ s2 ] we show that the discrete quadratic fields form a relatively compact sequence of distributions with respect to the @xmath25-skorohod topology on the space of distribution - valued , _ cdlg _ paths . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we show that the discrete quadratic fields converge to the unique stationary solution of equation .",
    "the proof is divided in three parts .",
    "recall that limit points exists due to tightness . in section [ s3.1 ]",
    "we show that any limit point is continuous ; this will be important later when characterizing some martingales in terms of quadratic variations . in section [ s3.2 ]",
