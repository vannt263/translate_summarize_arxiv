    "alice entangles her particle with a third one , namely the one whose state is to be teleported .",
    "then she performs a destructive joint - measurement on the two - particle system on her side .",
    "next , she communicates through a classic channel the outcome of the measure to bob . through this information",
    "he can reconstruct the original quantum state by simply applying local operations on his particle .",
    "clearly the scheme of teleportation relies on the prior establishment of quantum entanglement between the two parties .",
    "however , only classical communication is used after the particle to be teleported comes into play at alice side .",
    "while experimental realization of quantum teleportation protocols has been performed in nmr  @xcite , optical  @xcite , and atomic systems  @xcite , no evidence of teleportation in semiconductor systems has been achieved so far .",
    "indeed , semiconductor technology represents a viable approach for the realization of quantum computing devices , and quantum teleportation would be a crucial validation of its potentiality .",
    "theoretical proposals for electron teleportation in solid - state systems are based on single  @xcite and double  @xcite quantum dots .",
    "teleportation protocols using edge channels in the quantum hall effect have also been advanced  @xcite . however , quantum - wire systems have the advantage of intrinsically providing the qubit transmission between specified locations , as required by the divincenzo criteria  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they could be directly integrated in traditional electronic circuitry and allow in principle the implementation of a large number of quantum hardware units thus overcoming the scalability problem . in this frame ,",
    "coherent electron transport in systems of couples of semiconductor quantum wires has been used to design qubits and to propose fundamental one- and two - qubit quantum gates  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of surface acoustic waves ( saws ) as a mean to inject and drive carriers along the wires presents some advantages with respect to the free propagation along quasi-1d channels since it prevents the spreading of the electron wavefunction , it reduces undesired reflection effects , and it makes the electron more immune to the decohering effects of the phonons  @xcite .    in this work we propose and simulate numerically a scheme to perform quantum deterministic teleportation of electrons in a device consisting of three couples of semiconductor quantum wires .",
    "the carriers are embedded in the minima of saws , propagating in the wires direction .",
    "the qubit - state is encoded through the localization of a single electron in one of two parallel quantum wires . in our scheme , the coulomb interaction between carriers is used first for the production of an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair of electrons , and then for the rotation of the bell states needed to perform a bell measurement@xcite .",
    "we note that the teleportation model described in the following could also be applied , without qualitative modifications , to edge channels in the quantum hall regime .",
    "in fact , the latter system has already successfully exposed the two - particle quantum interference via an electronic version of the hanbury brown twiss setup  @xcite .",
    "the physical system used to implement our quantum teleportation scheme consists of three electrons injected by saw along three couples of gaas quantum wires .",
    "we assume that the device operates at low temperatures ( simulations are performed at zero temperature ) in order to have a negligible number of electrons in the conduction band and to minimize decoherence effects due to the interactions of electron with lattice vibrations .",
    "the use of saw for the injection and transport of electrons in the quantum wires  @xcite allows a single carrier to be captured into a minimum of the sinusoidal piezoelectric wave propagating along the device and inhibits the natural spatial spreading of the wavepacket . in this way",
    "the particle is confined in a moving quantum dot  @xcite and a so - called flying qubit is realized  @xcite .    in order to implement the quantum operations for the teleportation scheme we employ three elements : an electronic beam splitter @xmath0 , a phase shifter @xmath1 and a coulomb coupler @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the former is realized through a coupling window between the two wires of a qubit , able to split an incoming wavefunction into two parts  @xcite . in terms of qubit transformations",
    "it corresponds to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the electronic phase shifter @xmath1 is realized by introducing a suitable potential barrier in the wire @xmath5(@xmath6 ) .",
    "it acts only on a single qubit state by adding a phase factor , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the @xmath2 coulomb coupler is the only two - qubit gate .",
    "it consists of a region in which two electrons propagating along two different wires get close enough to each other to give rise to an effective interaction .",
    "a phase @xmath11 is added if and only if the two - qubit systems is in @xmath12 and the @xmath2 gate acts as follows : @xmath13 , leaving the other three two - qubit states unchanged .",
    "the above quantum gates have been numerically validated elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the phases @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 depend upon the physical and geometrical parameters of the system , e.g. the window length , the barrier height / length , the electron - electron coupling strength , the saw velocity . the proposed teleportation scheme ( with the exception of qubit 3 preparation )",
    "employs only quantum gates with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and we tuned the device parameters accordingly . for brevity ,",

    "the first two couples of quantum wires from the top represent the alice s system , while the bottom couple is bob s system .",
    "the bell - state preparation of qubits 1 and 2 consists of two beam splitters @xmath19 and @xmath20 followed by a coulomb coupler @xmath21 and a further splitting @xmath19 of qubit 1 .",
    "the gates in the dotted box labelled sp is needed to prepare the input state @xmath22 .",
    "this block applied to @xmath23 produces the general one qubit - state @xmath24 .",
    "the bell - measurement process in alice s system is realized in two sequential steps .",
    "first a complete rotation from bell states to separable states is performed by means of the beam splitter @xmath20 followed by a coulomb coupler @xmath25 and further inverse rotations of @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ". then the single - qubit states are measured by means of charge detectors ( green boxes ) .",
    "the outcome is communicated through a classical channel ( dashed lines ) to bob , which reconstructs in @xmath29 the original quantum state of qubit 3 by means of a network of one - qubit gates ( two beam splitters @xmath19 and two potential barriers ) .",
    "specifically , the potential barrier @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is switched on if and only if the outcome of qubit 2(3 ) measurement is 0 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . ]    the quantum - wire network for our teleportation protocol is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . as a first step alice and bob must entangle qubits 2 and 1 .",
    "in particular , they start with an initial state @xmath32  @xcite , corresponding to one electron entering the upper wire of bob qubit 1 and another electron entering the upper wire of alice qubit 2 . the first block of quantum gates , namely two coupling windows @xmath33 ( acting on qubits 1 and 2 , respectively ) and a coulomb coupler @xmath34 ( acting on qubits 1 and 2 , together ) produces a maximally entangled state @xmath35 .",
    "now alice , wants to teleport , the quantum state of electron 3 @xmath36 , obtained from @xmath23 by means of the network of one - qubit gates reported in the state preparation ( sp ) box , into electron 1 at bob side .",
    "she performs a so - called bell measurement on qubits 3 and 2 .",
    "in fact , as suggested by brassard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , such a measurement can be realized in two steps : first the bell states of qubits 2 and 3 are rotated in the basis @xmath37 , then a projective measurement is performed in this latter basis .",
    "this approach permits to achieve deterministic quantum teleportation , since it makes possible a full bell measurement on alice s particles . in our scheme ,",
    "the first step of the brassard approach is performed by means of the second block of quantum gates involving a coulomb coupler @xmath34 now acting on the qubits 2 and 3 and three @xmath33 gates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the three - qubit state obtained after this block takes the form :    @xmath38    after this rotation alice can perform two single - particle measurements on qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "specifically , such measurements can be realized by means of single - electron transistors , acting as sensitive charge detectors .",
    "once the result is known , it can be transmitted as two classical bits of information to bob , that can choose the setup of proper unitary operations on his qubit 1 in order to completely recover the initial state @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , depending upon the outcome of the measurement on qubits 2 and 3 , suitable potential barriers acting as phase shifters @xmath40 are eventually introduced between the two coupling windows , according table  [ tab1 ] .    .",
    "the phase shifters ( potential barriers ) in the final stage of the bob qubit are applied according to the outcome of alice measurements in order to reconstruct the original state @xmath39 .",
    "note that the phase shifter @xmath41 is controlled only by the qubit 3 ( 2 ) , i.e. the potential barrier is introduced only when the electron is found in the lower wire of the corresponding qubit at alice side .",

    "a semi-1d model has been adopted , as described in the following by referring to fig .",
    "the network is defined in the @xmath42-plane . in the @xmath43 direction",

    ", the @xmath48 variables can assume only the values 0 or 1 , identifying one of the two possible wires of a qubit , that is the qubit state .",
    "this allows us to move from a time dependent schrdinger equation for a seven - variable wavefunction @xmath49 to eight coupled schrdinger equations of the form @xmath50 the potential term appearing in the above equation is given by the sum of two contributions .",

    "specifically , in the numerical investigations performed , @xmath52= 20 mev , @xmath53= 200 nm , and @xmath55 cm s@xmath56 the second term represents the screened coulomb interaction between carriers , computed from the geometry of the system and can be written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58=@xmath59 with @xmath60 indicating the distance between the wires @xmath61 and @xmath62 at the positions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "this is a coulomb potential multiplied by an exponential damping term , corresponding to debye wave vector @xmath65 . in particular , in our calculations the latter has been taken equal to 0.2 nm@xmath66 : a value of the same of order of the ones given in the literature  @xcite . due to the geometry of the system and",
    "to screening effects , the coulomb interaction can be considered negligible everywhere for not adjacent qubits , that is qubit 1 and 3 , and in the regions not involving the coulomb coupler for nearby qubits .",

    "( [ sch ] ) has been solved by means of simple - finite - difference relaxation method applied at each time step of the time evolution performed in a crank - nicholson scheme with @xmath67=0.01 fs  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in the simulation of the three - particle wave function dynamics , the only gate that presents a computational challenge due to its spatial extension and the two - particle potential involved , is the coulomb coupler @xmath34 .",
    "however , it is not always necessary to compute its effect on the whole wave function .",
    "in fact , when the first @xmath34 gate comes into action by entangling electrons 1 and 2 , electron 3 wave function remains factorizable . as a consequence , before the second @xmath34 gate , a two - particle simulation is sufficient .",
    "the numerical estimation of the second @xmath34 gate , between qubit 2 and 3 , requires more care since at this stage qubit 1 is already entangled with qubit 2 .",
    "this entanglement is not only related to the localization of electrons in one of their wires , but also to their positions @xmath68 and @xmath69 . as a consequence",
    ", the effect of the second coulomb coupler must be computed on the whole three - particle wave function .",
    "thanks to the superposition principle and to the fact that the interaction is just among electrons 2 and 3 , we performed different two - particle simulations for different values of @xmath68 and then computed the final state as the combination of the different evolutions .",
    "we found that , due to the sharp localization of the spatial wavepackets and to the small @xmath44-direction entanglement , the solution turns out to be practically independent from the choice of @xmath68 , as it will be shown by the numerical results reported in the next section .",
    "a number of numerical simulations have been performed in order to obtain the optimal geometry for the coulomb coupler @xmath34 .",
    "this is reached when the delay phase @xmath11 attains @xmath70 . as shown in other works  @xcite , the latter mainly depends upon two geometrical parameters : the length of the coupling region and the distance between the coupled wires . from the optimization procedure , we find that the coulomb coupler is 150 nm long while the coupled wires are 5 nm distant from each other .",
    "this geometry allows a value of 0.88@xmath70 for the delay - phase @xmath11 , which is good enough for realizing both the initial maximally entangled state and the final rotation of the bell states at alice side .",
    "the experimental realization of the coulomb coupler @xmath34 is the most challenging part .",
    "specifically , the angle formed by a wire where it bends towards the other qubit must be small enough in order to make reflection phenomena negligible .",
    "in addition , no tunnelling between the two wires must be present to let the two wavefunctions only interact through coulomb coupling .    obviously , within our semi 1d - model it is not possible to simulate directly the dynamics of the wave function splitting by a coupling window leading to the one - qubit transformation @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , we exploited the results of 2d simulations to validate the qubit transformations  @xcite and include the beam splitters through their corresponding transformation matrix .",

    "thus it seems reasonable to take into account only spontaneous emission processes .",
    "these obviously affect the ideal fidelity of the gates implemented in the teleportation scheme .",
    "however such unavoidable effects can be minimized by inserting suitable quantum error correction codes in our scheme  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to use more two - qubit gates for the same computation .",

    "numerical simulations show that , with a suitable design of the nanostructure , the fidelity of the teleportation can reach values close to 1 , indicating a high - realibility of the process .",
    "furthermore , we also mention the possibility of using carrier transport in edge states for quantum hall effect regime , instead of saw - assisted electron transport in quantum wires .",
    "the experimental realization of the device proposed is challenging since it requires the use of frontier mesoscopic semiconductor technology .",
    "however , both the new developments in nanostructures fabrication permitting the control of the coupling between two modes of two 1d - channels  @xcite , and the recent observation of single electron dynamics in experiments of saw assisted charge transport  @xcite , seem to indicate the feasibility of an experimental setup of our device .",
