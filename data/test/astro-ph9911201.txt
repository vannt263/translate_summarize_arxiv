    "the ultimate fate of the gas which cools in cooling flows is still unknown .",
    "a possibility is that a fraction of the gas forms cold molecular clouds @xcite . as a result of fragmentation",
    "we expect the formation of small clouds with higher density and possible production of molecules in particular @xmath0 and traces of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "+ taking into account radiative transfer effects we computed analytically in @xcite the cooling function @xmath3 for the transition between the ground state and the first rotational level . this way we determined a lower limit of @xmath4 .",
    "+ meanwhile we improved this calculation by including numerically all rotational transitions which are relevant at low temperatures ( i.e. up to @xmath5 ) .",
    "+ the following column densities are adopted for a typical small cloud ( with @xmath6@xmath7 ) : @xmath8 , which corresponds to a @xmath2 abundance : @xmath9 . for @xmath1",
    "instead we assume the primordial ratio @xmath10 .",
    "+ in figure 1 we plotted the molecular cooling function @xmath3 taking into account @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the range 3 - 300 k. @xmath2 is the main coolant in the range of temperatures 3 - 80 k , @xmath1 in the range 80 - 150 k and @xmath0 dominates above 150 k.",
    "the heating is given by the external x - ray flux as produced from the hot intracluster gas .",
    "the thermal balance between heating and cooling leads to an equilibrium temperature for the clouds .",
    "we have calculated the minimum equilibrium temperature @xmath11 of the clumps inside the cooling flow region .",
    "table 1 shows the equilibrium temperature for different clusters . for comparison",
    "we give the values we find using our analytical approximation ( @xmath12=1 ) and the ones by taking into account higher excited rotational levels ( @xmath12=5 ) .",
    "one clearly sees that the inclusion of the higher excited levels into the calculations lowers the equilibrium temperature , particularly for hot clusters such as for instance abell 478 .",
    "+ we conclude that thermal equilibrium can be achieved at very low temperatures inside the cooling flow region mainly due to @xmath2-cooling . other molecules than @xmath2 , for example @xmath13 or @xmath14 , could also be important .",
    "thus the study of the chemistry in cooling flows might lead to important insight ."
