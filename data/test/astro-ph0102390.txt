    "it is well known that primordial black holes ( pbhs ) could have formed in the early universe @xcite . a comparison of the cosmological density at any time after the big bang with the density associated with a black hole shows that pbhs would have of order the particle horizon mass at their formation epoch : m(t ) 10 ^ 15(t10 ^ - 23  s ) g. pbhs could thus span an enormous mass range : those formed at the planck time ( @xmath1s ) would have the planck mass ( @xmath2 g ) , whereas those formed at 1  s would be as large as @xmath3 , comparable to the mass of the holes thought to reside in galactic nuclei .",
    "pbhs would could arise in various ways @xcite .",
    "since the early universe is unlikely to have been exactly friedmann , they would form most naturally from initial inhomogeneities but they might also form through other mechanisms at a cosmological phase transition .    the realization that small pbhs might exist prompted hawking to study their quantum properties .",
    "this led to his famous discovery @xcite that black holes radiate thermally with a temperature t = c^38gmk 10 ^ 26 ( mg)^-1  k 10 ^ -7 ( m)^-1  k. this means that they evaporate on a timescale ( m ) 10 ^ 64 ( m)^3  . only black holes smaller than @xmath4",
    "g would have evaporated by the present epoch , so eqn ( 1 ) implies that this effect could be important only for black holes which formed before @xmath5s . despite the conceptual importance of this result ,",
    "it is bad news for pbh enthusiasts .",
    "for since pbhs with a mass of @xmath4 g , which evaporate at the present epoch , would have a temperature of order 100  mev , the observational limit on the @xmath6-ray background intensity at 100  mev immediately implies that their density could not exceed @xmath7 times the critical density @xcite .",
    "not only does this render pbhs unlikely dark matter candidates , it also implies that there is little chance of detecting black hole explosions at the present epoch @xcite .    despite this conclusion",
    ", pbh evaporations could still have interesting cosmological consequences .",
    "in particular , they might generate the microwave background @xcite or modify the standard cosmological nucleosynthesis scenario @xcite or contribute to the cosmic baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "pbh evaporations might also account for the annihilation - line radiation coming from the galactic centre @xcite or the unexpectedly high fraction of antiprotons in cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "pbh explosions occurring in an interstellar magnetic field might also lead to radio bursts @xcite .",
    "even if pbhs had none of these consequences , studying such effects leads to strong upper limits on how many of them could ever have formed and thereby constrains models of the early universe .",
    "indeed pbhs serve as a probe of times much earlier than that associated with most other",
    " relicts \" of the big bang .",
    "while photons decoupled at @xmath8y , neutrinos at @xmath9  s and wimps at @xmath10s , pbhs go all the way back to the planck time .",
    "therefore even if pbhs never formed , their non - existence gives interesting information .",
    "we review the formation mechanisms and evaporation constraints on pbhs in section 2 .",
    "much of this material is also contained in my contribution to the 1996 chalonge school @xcite .",
    "however , there have been several interesting developments since then and these are covered in section 3 .",
    "the remaining sections will examine how the pbh constraints are modified if the value of the gravitational  constant \" @xmath0 was different at early times .",
    "as reviewed in section 4 , this idea has a long history and should no longer be regarded as exotic .",
    "it arises in various scalar - tensor theories of gravity and these are a natural setting for many currently popular models of the early universe .",
    "black hole formation and evaporation could be greatly modified in variable-@xmath0 cosmologies , since many of their properties ( eg . their hawking temperature ) depend explicitly on @xmath0 . however , as emphasized by barrow @xcite and discussed in section 5 , the nature of the modification depends upon whether the pbh preserves the value of @xmath0 at its formation epoch ( corresponding to what is termed `` gravitational memory '' ) or always maintains the changing background value .",
    "there would be interesting modifications to the cosmological consequences of pbh evaporations in both cases but they would be more dramatic in the first .",
    "barrow & carr @xcite considered the implications of these two scenarios in detail and this work has been taken further with goymer @xcite .",
    "we will review the conclusions of these papers in section 6 and highlight a particularly interesting development in section 7 .",
    "one of the most important reasons for studying pbhs is that it enables one to place limits on the spectrum of density fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "this is because , if the pbhs form directly from density perturbations , the fraction of regions undergoing collapse at any epoch is determined by the root - mean - square amplitude @xmath11 of the fluctuations entering the horizon at that epoch and the equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "one usually expects a radiation equation of state ( @xmath13 ) in the early universe . in order to collapse against the pressure",
    ", an overdense region must be larger than the jeans length at maximum expansion and this is just @xmath14 times the horizon size .",
    "on the other hand , it can not be larger than the horizon size , else it would form a separate closed universe and not be part of our universe @xcite .",
    "this has two important implications .",
    "firstly , pbhs forming at time @xmath15 should have of order the horizon mass given by eqn ( 1 ) .",
    "secondly , for a region destined to collapse to a pbh , one requires the fractional overdensity at the horizon epoch , @xmath16 , to exceed @xmath6 . providing the density fluctuations have a gaussian distribution and",
    "are spherically symmetric , one can infer that the fraction of regions of mass @xmath17 which collapse is @xcite ( m ) ~(m ) where @xmath18 is the value of @xmath11 when the horizon mass is @xmath17 .",
    "the pbhs can have an extended mass spectrum only if the fluctuations are scale - invariant ( i.e. with @xmath11 independent of @xmath17 ) but this is expected in many scenarios .    the fluctuations required to make the pbhs may either be primordial or they may arise spontaneously at some epoch .",
    "one natural source of fluctuations would be inflation @xcite and , in this context , @xmath19 depends implicitly on the inflationary potential .",
    "pbhs formed before inflation would be drastically diluted but new ones could form from the fluctuations generated after inflation .",
    "many people have studied pbh formation in this context @xcite as an important way of constraining the inflationary potential .",
    "this was the focus of my 1996 erice lecture , so it will not be covered again here .",
    "note that the gaussian assumption has been questioned in the inflationary context @xcite , so eqn ( 4 ) may not apply , but one still finds that @xmath20 depends very sensitively on @xmath11 .",
    "in some situations eqn ( 4 ) would fail qualitatively .",
    "for example , pbhs would form more easily if the equation of state of the universe were ever soft ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "this might apply if there was a phase transition which channelled the mass of the universe into non - relativistic particles or which temporally reduced the pressure . in this case , only those regions which are sufficiently spherically symmetric at maximum expansion can undergo collapse ; the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath11 would then have the form @xcite = 0.02 ^ 13/2 , which is much weaker than indicated by eqn ( 4 ) , but there would still be a unique relationship between the two parameters . some formation mechanisms for pbhs do not depend on having primordial fluctuations at all .",
    "for example , at any spontaneously broken symmetry epoch , pbhs might form through the collisions of bubbles of broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "pbhs might also form spontaneously through the collapse of cosmic strings @xcite or domain walls @xcite . in these cases",
    "@xmath22 depends , not on @xmath19 , but on other cosmological parameters , such the bubble formation rate or the string mass - per - length .",
    "these mechanisms were discussed in more detail in my 1996 erice contribution @xcite .",
    "in all these scenarios , the current density parameter @xmath23 associated with pbhs which form at a redshift @xmath24 or time @xmath15 is related to @xmath20 by @xcite _",
    "r(1+z ) 10 ^ 6 ( ts)^-1/2 10 ^ 18(m10 ^ 15g)^-1/2 where @xmath25 is the density parameter of the microwave background and we have used eqn ( 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 factor arises because the radiation density scales as @xmath27 , whereas the pbh density scales as @xmath28 .",
    "any limit on @xmath23 therefore places a constraint on @xmath22 and the constraints are summarized in fig .",
    "1 . the constraint for non - evaporating mass ranges above @xmath4 g comes from requiring @xmath29 .",
    "stronger constraints are associated with pbhs smaller than this since they would have evaporated by now @xcite .",
    "the strongest one is the @xmath6-ray limit associated with the @xmath4 g pbhs evaporating at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "other ones are associated with the generation of entropy and modifications to the cosmological production of light elements .",
    "the constraints below @xmath30 g are based on the ( not necessarily secure ) assumption that evaporating pbhs leave stable planck mass relics , in which case these relics are required to have less than the critical density @xcite .",
    "the constraints on @xmath22 can be converted into constraints on @xmath19 using eqn ( 4 ) and these are shown in fig .",
    "2 . also shown here",
    "are the ( non - pbh ) constraints associated with the spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background induced by the dissipation of intermediate scale density perturbations and the cobe quadrupole measurement , as well as lines corresponding to various slopes in the @xmath18 relationship .",
    "this shows that one needs the fluctuation amplitude to decrease with increasing scale in order to produce pbhs .",
    "[ f1 ]    [ f2 ]",
    "recent hydrodynamical calculations for the @xmath31 case have refined the criterion @xmath32 for pbh formation and this modifies the estimate for @xmath22 given by eqn ( 4 ) .",
    "niemeyer & jedamzik @xcite find that one needs @xmath33 rather than @xmath34 to ensure pbh formation , and shibata & sasaki @xcite reach similar conclusions .",
    "they also find that there is little accretion after pbh formation , as expected theoretically @xcite .",
    "another interesting development has been the application of  critical phenomena \" to pbh formation .",
    "studies of the collapse of various types of spherically symmetric matter fields have shown that there is always a critical solution which separates those configurations which form a black hole from those which disperse to an asymptotically flat state .",
    "the configurations are described by some index @xmath35 and , as the critical index @xmath36 is approached , the black hole mass is found to scale as @xmath37 for some exponent @xmath38 .",
    "this effect was first discovered for scalar fields @xcite but subsequently demonstrated for radiation @xcite and then more general fluids with equation of state @xmath39 @xcite .    in all these studies",
    "the spacetime was assumed to be asymptotically flat .",
    "however , niemeyer & jedamzik @xcite have recently applied the same idea to study black hole formation in asymptotically friedmann models and have found similar results . for a variety of initial density perturbation profiles , they find that the relationship between the pbh mass and the the horizon - scale density perturbation has the form m = k m_h(- _ c)^ where @xmath40 is the horizon mass and the constants are in the range @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the various configurations . since @xmath44 as @xmath45",
    ", this suggests that pbhs may be much smaller than the particle horizon at formation ( although it is clear that a fluid description must break down if they are too small ) and it also modifies the mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "there has been particular interest recently in whether pbhs could have formed at the quark - hadron phase transition at @xmath2s .",
    "this is because the horizon mass is of order @xmath46 then , so such pbhs would naturally have the sort of mass required to explain the macho microlensing results @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in my other lecture at this meeting .",
    "one might expect pbhs to form more easily at that epoch because of a temporary softening of the equation of state .",
    "if the qcd phase transition is assumed to be of 1st order , then hydrodynamical calculations show that the value of @xmath16 required for pbh formation is indeed reduced below the value which pertains in the radiation case @xcite .",
    "this means that pbh formation will be strongly enhanced at the qcd epoch , with the mass distribution being peaked around the horizon mass .",
    "one of the interesting implications of the pbh macho scenario is the possible existence of a halo population of _ binary _ black holes @xcite . with a full halo of such objects , there could then be @xmath47 binaries inside 50 kpc and some of these could be coalescing due to gravitational radiation losses at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "current interferometers ( such as ligo ) could detect such coalescences within 50 mpc , corresponding to a few events per year .",
    "future space - borne interferometers ( such as lisa ) might detect 100 coalescences per year .",
    "if the associated gravitational waves were detected , it would provide a unique probe of the halo distribution ( eg . its density profile and core radius @xcite .",
    "kohri & yokoyama @xcite have recently improved the constraints on @xmath48 which come from cosmological nucleosynthesis considerations .",
    "constraints from neutrino background have also been presented by bugaev & konischev @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of a galactic @xmath6-ray background @xcite , measurements of the antiproton flux @xcite , and the discovery of very short period @xmath6-ray burts @xcite may even provide positive evidence for such pbhs .",
    "this is discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "some people have emphasized the possibility of detecting very high energy cosmic rays from pbhs using air shower techniques @xcite .",
    "however , recently these efforts have been set back by the claim of heckler @xcite that qed interactions could produce an optically thick photosphere once the black hole temperature exceeds @xmath49 gev . in this case , the mean photon energy is reduced to @xmath50 , which is well below @xmath51 , so the number of high energy photons is much reduced .",
    "he has proposed that a similar effect may operate at even lower temperatures due to qcd effects @xcite .",
    "this is discussed further in the contribution of kapusta at this meeting @xcite .",
    "however , these arguments should not be regarded as definitive : macgibbon @xcite claim that heckler has not included lorentz factors correctly in going from the black hole frame to the centre - of - mass frame of the interacting particles ; in their calculation qed interactions are never important .",
    "most variable - g scenarios associate the gravitational `` constant '' with some form of scalar field @xmath52 .",
    "this notion has its roots in kaluza - klein theory , in which a scalar field appears in the metric component @xmath53 associated with the 5th dimension .",
    "einstein - maxwell theory then requires that this field be related to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although this was assumed constant in the original kaluza - klein theory , dirac @xcite noted the the ratio of the electric to gravitational force between to protons ( @xmath54 ) and the ratio of the age of the universe to the atomic timescale ( @xmath55 ) and the square - root of the number of particles in the universe ( @xmath56 ) are all comparable and of order @xmath57 . this unlikely coincidence led him to propose that these relationships must _ always _ apply , which requires g t^-1 , gm / r ~1 , where @xmath58 is the horizon scale .",
    "the first condition led jordan @xcite to propose a theory in which the scalar field in kaluza - klein theory is a function of _ both _ space and time , and this then implies that @xmath59 has the same property .",
    "the second condition implies the mach - type relationship @xmath60 , which suggests @xcite that @xmath52 is a solution of the wave equation @xmath61 .",
    "this motivated brans - dicke ( bd ) theory @xcite , in which the einstein - hilbert lagrangian is replaced by l = r - _ , _ , g^ + l_m , where @xmath62 is the matter langrangian and the constant @xmath63 is the bd parameter .",
    "the potential @xmath52 then satisfies = ( ) t , where @xmath64 is the trace of the matter stress - energy tensor , and this has the required machian form .",
    "since @xmath52 must have a contribution from _ local _ sources of the form @xmath65 , this entails a violation of the strong equivalence principle . in order to test this ,",
    "the ppn formalism was introduced .",
    "applications of this test in a variety of astrophysical situations ( involving the solar system , the binary pulsar and white dwarf cooling ) currently require @xmath66 , which implies that the deviations from general relativity can only ever be small in bd theory @xcite .",
    "the introduction of generalized scalar - tensor theories @xcite , in which @xmath63 is itself a function of @xmath52 , led to a considerably broader range of variable-@xmath0 theories .",
    "in particular , it permitted the possibility that @xmath63 may have been small at early times ( allowing noticeable variations of @xmath0 then ) even if it is large today . in the last decade interest in such theories",
    "has been revitalized as a result of early universe studies .",
    "inflation theory @xcite has made the introduction of scalar fields almost mandatory and extended inflation specifically requires a model in which @xmath0 varies @xcite . in higher dimensional kaluza - klein - type cosmologies ,",
    "the variation in the sizes of the extra dimensions also naturally leads to a variation in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the currently popular low energy string cosmologies necessarily involve a scalar ( dilaton ) field @xcite and bosonic superstring theory , in particular , leads @xcite to a lagrangian of the form ( 9 ) with @xmath67 .    the intimate connection between dilatons , inflatons and scalar - tensor theory arises because one can always transform from the ( physical ) jordan frame to the einstein frame , in which the lagrangian has the standard einstein - hilbert form @xcite l = |r - 2_,_,|g^ + l_m . here",
    "the new scalar field @xmath68 is defined by d= ( ) ^1/2 and the barred ( einstein ) metric and gravitational constant are related to the original ( jordan ) ones by g _ = a()^2 |g_,g = [ 1+^2 ( ) ] a()^2 |g , a/a , where the function @xmath69 specifies a conformal transformation and a prime denotes @xmath70 . thus scalar - tensor theory can be related to general relativity plus a scalar field , although the theories are not identical because particles do not follow geodesics in the einstein frame .",
    "the behaviour of homogeneous cosmological models in bd theory is well understood @xcite .",
    "their crucial feature is that they are vacuum - dominated at early times but always tend towards the general relativistic solution during the radiation - dominated era .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the radiation energy - momentum tensor is trace - free [ i.e. @xmath71 in eqn ( 10 ) ] .",
    "this means that the full radiation solution can be approximated by joining a bd vacuum solution to a general relativistic radiation solution at some time @xmath72 , which may be regarded as a free parameter of the theory .",

    "the behaviour of cosmological models in more general scalar - tensor theories depends on the form of @xmath82 but they still retain the feature that the general relativistic solution is a late - time attractor during the radiation era . since one requires @xmath83 to @xmath84 at the epoch of primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite , one needs the vacuum - dominated phase to end at some time @xmath85 1 s. the theory approaches general relativity in the weak field limit only if @xmath86 and @xmath87 but @xmath82 is otherwise unconstrained .",

    "however , it must be emphasized that this conclusion need not follow if the black hole has a size _ comparable _ to the particle horizon at formation and , as indicated in section 2 , this is expected for a pbh .    another way to investigate",

    "although this suggests that there is no gravitational memory , it should be stressed that this conclusion only applies for dust and if one neglects the back reaction .",
    "since we lack definite knowledge about the evolution of the scalar field when a black hole forms in a cosmological background , it is useful to consider a range of scenarios which go beyond the two possibilities envisaged by barrow . in general , the background scalar field will have a present value @xmath109 and a value @xmath110 when the black hole first formed .",

    "however , even if @xmath52 were homogeneous initially , one would expect it to become inhomogeneous as collapse proceeds .",
    "indeed , in the dust case , this is confirmed by the numerical calculations described above @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the background value is increasing ( as usually applies ) , one would expect @xmath52 in the collapsing region to become first _ larger _ than the background value on a local dynamical timescale and then _ smaller _ than it on a cosmological timescale .",
    "such behaviour would necessarily entail a variation of @xmath52 in space as well as time .",
    "we must also allow for the possibility that @xmath52 may vary interior to @xmath119 but on a slower or faster timescale than the background .",
    "we therefore propose two further scenarios : .2 in    scenarioc : |_eh(t)| |_ph(t)| for  all  t where the dot represents a time derivative .",
    "this implies that the scalar field evolves faster at the event horizon than at the particle horizon until it eventually becomes homogeneous , see fig .",
    "we describe this as _ short - term _ gravitational memory and it reduces to scenario a as the timescale to become homogeneous tends to zero .",
    "this would apply , for example , if @xmath52 were to change on the dynamical timescales of the black hole since this is usually less than the cosmological timescale .",
    "scenario d : [ beta ] |_eh(t)|",
    "< |_ph(t)| for  all  t this implies that @xmath52 evolves faster at the particle horizon than the event horizon , see fig .",
    "we describe this is as _ weak _ gravitational memory and it reduces to scenario b when the left - hand - side of eqn ( [ beta ] ) is zero . in this case , the evolution of @xmath52 is again dominated by the black hole inside some length - scale @xmath119 . note that , in either this scenario or the last one , the length - scale @xmath119 need not be fixed , since it could either grow or shrink as scalar gravitational radiation propagates .",
    "a particular example of this , to which we return shortly , would be _ self - similar _ gravitational memory , in which the ratio of @xmath111 to @xmath112 always remains the same .",
    ".2 in    [ f4 ]",
    "in general relativity there is an equivalence between a scalar field and a stiff fluid and this can be exploited in studying gravitational memory . in the einstein frame ,",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is |t _ = ( + p)u _ u _ + |g _ p where @xmath122 is the velocity of the fluid .",
    "if we define a velocity field by [ fvel ] u _ = , this gives |t _ = - + p |g_. by comparing this to the energy - momentum tensor for a scalar field , we find that p = = - |g^ | _ | _ , so we have a stiff fluid .",
    "this equivalence applies provided that the derivative of the scalar field is timelike .",
    "otherwise the velocity field defined in ( [ fvel ] ) would be imaginary .",
    "this is relevant to the gravitational memory problem because we can now interpret the various scenarios discussed in section 6 in terms of the _ accretion _ of a stiff fluid .",
    "if the black hole does not accrete at all or accretes very little , this will correspond to strong or weak gravitational memory ( scenarios b and d , respectively ) .",
    "however , if enough accretion occurs to homogenize @xmath52 , this will correspond to short - term gravitational memory ( scenario c ) .",
    "the faster the accretion , the shorter the memory , so scenario a corresponds to the idealization in which homogenization is instantaneous .",
    "a simple newtonian treatment @xcite for a general fluid suggests that the accretion rate in the einstein frame should be = 4r^2_a v_s , where @xmath123 is the accretion radius and @xmath124 is the sound - speed in the accreted fluid . for a stiff fluid , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , while @xmath127 in a friedmann universe at early times , so we have .",
    "this can be integrated to give [ mass ] m where @xmath128 is the black hole mass at the time @xmath113 when it formed .",
    "if we define a parameter @xmath129 , then eqn ( [ mass ] ) implies mm_f(1 - ) ^-1 as t. if @xmath130 , the black hole could not grow very much .",
    "however , if @xmath38 is close to 1 , which must be the case if @xmath131 , then the black hole could grow significantly .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath132 , eqn ( [ mass ] ) implies @xmath133 , so the black hole grows at the same rate as the universe .",
    "this simple calculation suggests that a black hole surrounded by a stiff fluid can accrete enough to grow at the same rate as the universe .    since the above calculation neglects the effects of the cosmological expansion , one needs a relativistic calculation to check this .",
    "the newtonian result suggests that one should look for a spherically symmetric _ self - similar _ solution , in which every dimensionless variable is a function of @xmath134 , so that it is unchanged by the transformation @xmath135 for any constant @xmath136 .",
    "this problem has an interesting but rather convolved history . by looking for a black hole solution attached to an exact friedmann solution via a sonic point , carr & hawking",
    "first showed that there is no such solution for a radiation fluid @xcite and the argument can be extended to a general @xmath39 fluid with @xmath137 .",
    "lin et al .",
    "@xcite subsequently claimed that there is such a solution in the special case @xmath138 .",
    "however , bicknell & henriksen @xcite then showed that this solution is unphysical , in that the density gradient diverges at the event horizon .",
    "this suggests that the black hole must soon become much smaller than the particle horizon , after which eqn ( 32 ) implies there will be very little further accretion .",
    "therefore the stiff fluid analysis suggests that there should be at least _ weak _ gravitational memory .",
    "we have seen that studying the formation and evaporation of pbhs can place interesting constraints on models of the early universe even if they never existed . on the other hand ,",
    "if they did exist , pbhs can provide unique information about times much earlier than those probed by any other relics of the big bang .",
    "in particular , they may provide information about the variation of @xmath0 at early times .",
    "the precise signature of such a variation depends upon the degree to which a black hole can  remember \" the value of @xmath0 at its formation epoch .",
    "this is still unclear but various methods are being pursued to resolve this issue .",
