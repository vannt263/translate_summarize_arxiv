    "the origin of the energy required to power the solar wind , and heat the sun s corona to its multi - million degree temperatures , remains an elusive mystery in physics .",
    "one promising mechanism involves the creation of alfvnic waves near the solar surface , which can penetrate upwards through the sun s atmosphere with minimal reflection or energy loss @xcite . to date",
    ", there has been great controversy surrounding the interpretation of periodic transverse motions as alfvn waves .",
    "magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves with a wave number , @xmath3 , can be considered `` kink '' oscillations when structured by a cylindrical waveguide .",
    "the associated periodic transverse motions imply a degree of plasma non - uniformity , resulting in intrinsic mhd waves exhibiting mixed ( i.e. slow , fast , alfvn ) properties depending on the local plasma parameters . as a result",
    ", the term `` alfvnic '' was introduced to describe waves which are predominantly characterised by the signatures displayed by pure alfvn waves .",
    "accordingly , transverse kink oscillations may often be considered alfvnic in nature providing they are incompressible , exhibit no intensity fluctuations along the structure , and display periodic displacements with the magnetic tension as the restoring force @xcite .",
    "thus , by definition , alfvnic waves require strong magnetic field concentrations , and/or a steep density gradient with the external plasma , to act as waveguides @xcite , allowing energy to be directly channelled through the solar atmosphere . in the sun s atmosphere , magnetic field lines clump together into tight bundles , forming flux tubes . the ubiquitous nature of alfvnic waves in magnetic flux tubes has been demonstrated in a range of chromospheric and coronal plasmas @xcite .",
    "spicules are dynamic , straw - like magnetic structures found in the solar chromosphere , and can be divided into two distinct classes @xcite .",
    "we will focus on type   spicules , which are ubiquitous throughout the solar atmosphere , and longer lived ( @xmath010  min ) than their jet - like type   counterparts @xcite .",
    "the narrow shape of all spicule structures ( @xmath4600  km ) , coupled with their rapidly evolving characteristics , places an utmost requirement for both high - spatial and -temporal resolution instrumentation .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite observed type  i spicules , which displayed periodic transverse motions with periods ranging from 50  500  s , coupled with velocity amplitudes exceeding 25  kms@xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , such image sequences of spicules have been tied to limb observations .",
    "while observations at the solar limb allow spicule height information to be easily retrieved , they do not allow simultaneous measurements of the sun s photosphere to be studied due to inherent line - of - sight effects .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have recently shown how spicule dynamics make them ideal candidates in the quest for discovering efficient energy propagation into higher layers of the sun s atmosphere .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath6 : spicule used for display purposes in figures  [ fig1][fig3 ] .",
    "+ @xmath7 : spicule used for display purposes in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "+    while transverse kink motion has been shown to be abundant in spicule observations , the underlying cause of the periodic motions has remained speculative .",
    "overshooting of convective motions in the photosphere , granular buffeting , rebound shocks , and global p - mode oscillations have all been suggested as candidates for the creation of spicule oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is known that oscillations in the lower solar atmosphere are prone to aspects of mode coupling , whereby one particular magneto - acoustic wave mode ( normally classified as  fast  or ",
    "slow  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may couple , and hence transfer wave energy , into another mode when atmospheric conditions are suitable @xcite .",
    "the rapid drop in density above the solar surface , coupled with the close proximity to oscillatory drivers , makes the photosphere and chromosphere an ideal location for the occurrence of efficient mode coupling .",
    "indeed , @xcite uncovered upward - propagating transverse oscillations , generated in large ( @xmath82000  km diameter ) photospheric bright points , which coupled into longitudinal waves at chromospheric heights .",
    "often , the coupled oscillations demonstrate power at frequencies equal to twice the original , as a result of non - linear interactions @xcite .",
    "contrarily , it has been demonstrated , both analytically and theoretically , that when the magnetic pressure is approximately equal to the gas pressure ( plasma @xmath9 ) in a solar flux tube , longitudinal to transverse mode coupling may also occur @xcite . to date , however , this form of `` reversed mode coupling '' has not been verified observationally . in this letter",
    ", we undertake a multi - wavelength approach , allowing type   spicules to be traced back to their anchor points on the solar surface .",
    "we provide conclusive evidence on how these ubiquitous oscillations manifest , and suggest what role they may take in the localized heating of the solar corona .",
    "the data presented here",
    "are part of an observing sequence obtained during 13:46  14:47  ut on 2009 may 28 , with the richard b. dunn solar telescope ( dst ) at sacramento peak , new mexico . the newly - commissioned rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere ( rosa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) six - camera system was employed to image a @xmath10 region positioned at solar disk center .",
    "a spatial sampling of @xmath11 per pixel was used for the rosa cameras , to match the telescope s diffraction - limited resolution in the blue continuum to that of the ccd .",
    "this results in images obtained at longer wavelengths being slightly oversampled .",
    "however , this was deemed desirable to keep the dimensions of the field - of - view the same for all rosa cameras .    during the observations presented here ,",
    "high - order adaptive optics @xcite were used to correct wavefront deformations in real - time .",
    "the acquired images were further improved through speckle reconstruction algorithms @xcite , utilizing @xmath12 restorations , providing reconstructed cadences of 0.528  s ( g - band ) and 4.224  s ( ca  k and h@xmath13 ) .",
    "more details of our instrumentation setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "atmospheric seeing conditions remained excellent throughout the time series .",
    "however , to insure accurate coalignment in all bandpasses , broadband time series were fourier co - registered and de - stretched using a @xmath14 grid , equating to a @xmath01.7@xmath15 separation between spatial samples @xcite .",
    "narrowband images were corrected by applying destretching vectors established from simultaneous broadband reference images @xcite .",
    "the rosa field - of - view shows a range of features , including exploding granules and a multitude of magnetic bright points ( mbps ; fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a large conglomeration of mbps were located at heliocentric coordinates ( 4 arcsec , @xmath16 arcsec ) , or s01w00 in the solar north - south - east - west coordinate system , providing an opportunity to examine these kilogauss structures without the line - of - sight spatial offsets normally associated with near - limb observations .",
    "examination of h@xmath13 images reveals a wealth of chromospheric jets and spicules , anchored into the solar surface at the locations of mbps .",
    "these data reveal how un - anchored ends of magnetic flux tubes are observed to sway periodically over many complete cycles ( supplementary movies 1 & 2 ) . to quantify the oscillatory parameters , a series of one - dimensional slits , each separated by 1 arcsec ( 725 km ) ,",
    "were placed perpendicular to the type   spicules along their entire length ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting time - distance cuts reveal numerous periodic transversal displacements of these chromospheric structures as a function of time .",
    "the sinusoid fitting algorithms of @xcite were used to extract periodic signatures from the transversal displacements present in the time - distance plots .",
    "we concentrate on the seven most prominent type   spicules , observed in both ca  k and h@xmath13 time - series , which can be accurately traced back to their photospheric counterparts .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ] displays a sample time - distance cut , revealing how these spicules demonstrate transverse kink oscillations above their corresponding mbp in the period range 65  220  s , with displacement amplitudes reaching as high as 670  km .",
    "velocity amplitudes often exceed 15  kms@xmath5 , indicating these dynamic motions are close to the chromospheric sound speed @xcite .",
    "table  [ table1 ] displays key characteristics of the spicules under investigation .",
    "no periodic transverse motions in either the mbp edge , or bright central peak , were detected in simultaneous photospheric g - band images , implying that either spicule motion is generated independent of processes manifesting on the solar surface , or that a form of efficient mode conversion between the two layers ( photosphere and chromosphere ) is occurring . to investigate the latter ,",
    "g - band intensities were averaged over the entire mbp structure under investigation , with fast fourier transforms and wavelet analysis routines subsequently applied on the resulting intensity fluctuations .",
    "we find significant oscillatory power ( exceeding 500 times the quiescent background ) in the averaged intensity of these g - band features , which typically occupy @xmath1750  pixels , or 130000  km@xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the most powerful intensity oscillations found in each photospheric mbp are at twice the period ( 130  440  s ) of the corresponding chromospheric transverse oscillation , indicating the presence of frequency doubling .",
    "the dominant period remains constant over each mbp surface , indicating the presence of powerful , yet coherent drivers .",
    "we further utilize our high - resolution observations to deduce additional parameters related to the longitudinal photospheric drivers , and find that the peak longitudinal oscillatory power is located at the center of each photospheric mbp , with a magnitude exceeding @xmath19 times the background average ( right panel of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "power decreases radially away from the center of the photospheric mbp , eventually dropping to zero at the edge of the structure .",
    "we compute the spatial distributions of oscillatory phase for the photospheric mbps relative to this position of peak power .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] reveals how deviations in phase angle , from the positions of peak - power , are within the range of @xmath20 to @xmath21  degrees , providing absolute phase shifts of @xmath090  degrees across each entire mbp structure .",
    "these phase shifts remain constant throughout the duration of periodic behaviour , with oscillatory power eventually ceasing as the mbp fragments .",
    "in addition , the detected photospheric mbp periodicities ( 130  440  s ) overlap with the solar p - mode spectrum @xcite , suggesting these global modes provide the underlying driving force required to generate spicule oscillations .    to investigate the temporal variations in wave behaviour",
    ", we calculate the oscillatory power at each time step , and compare with simultaneous measurements of the same spicule observed in different wavelengths .",
    "our analysis shows that the power of lower chromospheric ( ca  k ) transverse oscillations peaks after the photospheric ( g - band ) longitudinal periodicities , yet before the upper chromospheric ( h@xmath13 ) oscillations . figure  [ fig3 ] reveals how a discernible time lag exists between three distinct layers of the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "this implies that the observed chromospheric spicule oscillations are a result of upwardly propagating magneto - acoustic wave modes , generated at the solar surface , which couple into transverse kink waves in a region encompassing the photospheric / chromospheric boundary .",
    "an important trend to consider is how the power of detected oscillatory behaviour varies as a function of atmospheric height .",
    "power spectra for the g - band intensity , and ca  k and h@xmath13 transverse oscillations , were normalised to their respective quiescent backgrounds before comparison .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows an appreciable decrease in oscillatory power as a function of atmospheric height .",
    "this has important consequences , as it suggests the presence of physical damping , and therefore conversion into heat , of the observed wave modes .",
    "further examination of each mbp reveals multiple power peaks ( also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , suggesting the creation , and subsequent transverse behaviour of solar spicules , is quasi - periodic in nature .",
    "this is the first observational evidence of longitudinal - to - transverse mode coupling occurring in the sun s atmosphere .",
    "( red ) spicule time series .",
    "the x - axis is time from the start of the observing sequence , while the y - axis is power averaged over the entire mbp / spicule structure , and normalized to the background quiescent sun .",
    "g - band power is for oscillations in intensity at a period of 258  s , while the ca  k and h@xmath13 power is derived from the periodic transverse displacements of the spicule with a periodicity of 129  s. it is clear the g - band power leads the ca  k and h@xmath13 time - series , indicating the presence of an upward propagating magneto - acoustic wave , which couples into an transverse kink mode near the chromospheric boundary . ]    to further investigate the propagation and coupling of these wave phenomena , we utilized advanced two - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "these simulations were performed using the lare2d code @xcite , where a spicule was modelled as a density enhancement , embedded in a straight , uniform magnetic field .",
    "the spicule density has a symmetric epstein profile @xcite in the transverse direction , with a peak density 100 times the background value , and a diameter of approximately 600  km ( upper - left panel of fig  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength is chosen to give an external alfvn speed of 362  kms@xmath5 , and an alfvn speed of 36.2  kms@xmath5 at the centre of the spicule .",
    "a temperature profile is chosen to give a plasma @xmath9 , where efficient mode coupling is expected to occur @xcite .",
    "the simulation has a resolution of @xmath22 grid points , providing a numerical domain size of @xmath23  km@xmath18 . for the purposes of this investigation ,",
    "only effects up to a few thousand  km ( i.e. a region incorporating the photosphere and chromosphere ) will be considered .",
    "an artificial driver is applied at the lower boundary in the form of a longitudinal velocity component .",
    "this is consistent with the observational interpretation that the driver arises from a global p - mode oscillation .",
    "the coherent driver is applied across the diameter of the spicule , with a periodicity of 215  s , and a maximum amplitude of 12.5  kms@xmath5 . however , to remain consistent with parameters derived from the observational time series , one side of the simulated mbp has a phase difference of 90  degrees with respect to the other ( upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "as the driver is longitudinal and compressive , a 90  degree phase shift creates transverse ( i.e. across the spicule ) gradients in pressure which displace the spicule axis , generating the kink mode , in addition to producing periodic compressions and rarefactions ( sausage mode ) .",
    "these periodic pressure differences , across the body of the spicule , also induce a frequency doubling of the coupled transverse wave , visible in the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig4 ] by a change from a purely sinusoidal waveform . both transverse kink and sausage modes",
    "are readily apparent in the lower panels of figure  [ fig4 ] , where time - distance cuts of observational , and simulated data , are displayed ( see also supplementary movies 3 & 4 ) . in our simulations , the magnitude of the excited kink mode is smaller than the amplitude of the input longitudinal driver .",
    "this is a consequence of the uniform magnetic field strength used .",
    "in the real solar atmosphere , the magnetic field strength decreases rapidly with height , which is a likely contributor to the more prominent increase in kink amplitude seen in current ground- and space - based observations of chromospheric spicules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig4 ] indicates that the longitudinal - to - transverse mode - coupling mechanism present in our mhd simulations does promote a progressive increases in kink amplitude as a function of atmospheric height .    .",
    "_ bottom _ : a time - distance cut of the simulated spicule density , at a height of 2000  km above the photospheric boundary .",
    "there is a remarkable degree of similarity between the two lower panels , with both kink ( transverse displacement of spicule axis ) and sausage ( periodic compression and rarefaction ) modes visible .",
    "supplementary movies 3 & 4 display time - lapse image sequences of the simulations presented here . ]    by combining observed photospheric periodicities and phase distributions , in conjunction with realistic mbp structuring , our simulations reveal efficient , and ubiquitous , mode conversion of longitudinal oscillations into their transverse kink counterparts , at twice the driven frequency .",
    "the simulations display wave properties consistent with our observations , and demonstrate how transverse spicule oscillations , with significant amplitudes , readily exist in the solar atmosphere , and therefore have important consequences for energy transportation into the solar corona .",
    "we estimate the energy flux , e , of the observed chromospheric waves using @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass density of the flux tube , @xmath26 is the observed velocity amplitude and @xmath27 is the corresponding alfvn speed , defined as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the magnetic permeability . for a mass density of @xmath30  kgm@xmath31 , and a magnetic field strength @xmath32  g , derived from a bright network chromospheric model @xcite , coupled with an observed velocity amplitude of @xmath33  kms@xmath5 ,",
    "the energy flux in the chromosphere is @xmath34  wm@xmath2 .",
    "it is estimated that approximately 2.2% of the solar surface is covered by mbps @xcite , and if each mbp is linked to a single corresponding chromospheric type   spicule , it equates to an average global energy of 660  wm@xmath2 .",
    "current work suggests waves with an energy flux @xmath0100  wm@xmath2 are sufficiently vigorous to heat the localized corona and launch the solar wind when their energy is thermalized @xcite .",
    "therefore , a transmission coefficient of @xmath015% through the thin transition region would provide sufficient energy to heat the entire corona .",
    "regions on the solar surface containing highly magnetic structures , such as sunspots , pores and large mbp groups , should possess even higher mass densities and magnetic field strengths , in addition to a greater numbers of spicules . in this regime ,",
    "the energy flux available to heat the corona will be significantly higher than the minimum value required to sustain localized heating .",
    "we have utilized images of high spatial and temporal resolution , obtained with the rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere ( rosa ) instrument at the dunn solar telescope , to reveal how the generation of transverse kink oscillations in type   spicules is a direct result of mode conversion in the lower solar atmosphere . through comparison of our observations with advanced two - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ,",
    "we show how longitudinal pressure modes in photospheric magnetic bright points ( mbps ) , with periodicities in the range 130  440  s , funnel upwards through the sun s atmosphere , before converting into kink modes at twice the initial frequency , often with amplitudes exceeding 400  km .",
    "we conclude that the mode conversion and period modification is a direct consequence of the 90 degree phase shift encompassing opposite sides of the photospheric driver .",
    "this is the first observational evidence of this mechanism occurring in the solar atmosphere .",
    "energy flux estimates for these oscillations indicate that the waves are sufficiently energetic to accelerate the solar wind and heat the quiet corona to its multi - million degree temperatures .",
    "the naming of transverse oscillations observed in solar structures remains highly controversial , with definitions revolving around `` alfvn '' , `` alfvnic '' , and `` magneto - sonic kink '' terminology . while our observations demonstrate signatures consistent with previous studies on alfvnic waves ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have deliberately chosen to describe the observed periodic motions simply as transverse kink waves .",
    "this is currently the most unopposed description of such wave phenomena , and avoids the potential pitfalls of what is a rapidly developing area within solar physics .",
