    "the lab for adaptive optics ( lao ) currently has a testbed dedicated to the development of two key ao technologies for large telescopes ( called multi - conjugate ao ( mcao)@xcite and multi - object ao ( moao ) ) . both of these technologies take advantage of tomographic reconstructions using multiple guidestars ( a.k.a .",
    "reference sources)@xcite .",
    "in particular , mcao attempts to achieve a high strehl over a large field of view ( fov ) by accounting for anisoplanatism , using multiple deformable mirrors at optical conjugates .",
    "moao attempts to achieve very high strehls over small fovs embedded in larger uncorrected fields .",
    "first results from the testbed were shown in ammons 2006@xcite .",
    "recent results have demonstrated the effectiveness of tomography at finding the layers ofturbulence , and high strehls have been achieved with both mcao and moao .",
    "the testbed uses three optically addressed spatial light modulators ( slms ) from hamamatsu photonics .",
    "the slms allow us to have nearly 600,000 control elements , far more than any current mems .",
    "slms have been used with some success in the biological sciences ( for example , a demonstration is described in awwal 2003)@xcite .",
    "because their stroke is limited to approximately 1 wavelength deviation ( about 650 @xmath0 on the testbed ) and we would like to avoid phase - wrapping , we are incorporating a high stroke mirror into the testbed both to eliminate the need for the slms to phase wrap , and to test possible ao configurations for future systems called `` woofer - tweeter '' setups .",
    "taking an analogy from audio technology , the woofer - tweeter configuration in ao refers to the pairing of a higher resolution dm that has small stroke together with a high stroke ( and consequently low resolution ) dm called a woofer .",
    "though our testbed currently uses slms , woofer - tweeter combinations will also be useful for mems dms .",
    "in addition to our lab , similar architectures are being studied at u. victoria @xcite and at nui galway .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     the particular alpao dm52 mirror we have in the lab has about a 133 @xmath0 @xmath1 focus shape when initially powered on but with no commands sent . in order to generate a flat shape we measured and inverted this wavefront and ran it through wooferfit to generate flattening commands .",
    "our first attempt at flattening the dm52 in open - loop resulted in a residual of approximately 11 @xmath0 @xmath1 of surface flatness deviation over the full clear aperture of the mirror .",
    "we then tried to fit a typical kolmogorov wavefront .",
    "the testbed uses etched glass kolmogorov phase plates as turbulence generators .",
    "the phase plates are meant to simulate a normal atmosphere s worth of wavefront aberration .",
    "we measured the wavefront using a set of shack - hartmann wavefront sensors . after doing a tomographic reconstruction of the estimated volume",
    ", there is a residual on the ground layer with approximately 250 @xmath0 @xmath1 tip / tilt removed wavefront error .",
    "we then fit this kolmogorov wavefront with the alpao dm52 using wooferfit .",
    "we compared the surface of the mirror as measured by a zygo interferometer to the wavefront generated by the tomography software .",
    "our comparison shows a 25 @xmath0 @xmath1 disagreement between the alpao dm52 and the wooferfit predicted shape over the clear aperture ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] above ) .",
    "the fit was noticeably better within the central portion of the mirror and when apertured down to 90% of the clear aperture the agreement was roughly 20 @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that these results are significant because they represent open - loop `` go - to '' control of the surface without the benefit of feedback from residual wavefront measurements .",
    "hence these results are applicable to systems which need to run open - loop like moao configurations mentioned earlier .",
    "we have tested the suitability of the alpao dm52 as a woofer dm and have shown it has promising open - loop characteristics .",
    "initial results look good for woofer - tweeter implementation in our mcao testbed .",
