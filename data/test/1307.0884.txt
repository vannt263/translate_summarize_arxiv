    "a certain type of neutrino beam is generated by a muon source of very high intensity .",
    "these muons could be stored and allowed to decay in a ring containing a long straight section that points in a desired direction .",
    "this kind of system was historically called a _",
    "neutrino factory _ and its main foundations were first developed by s. geer  @xcite .",
    "the possible development of neutrino factories promises to increase the precision of neutrino oscillation parameters , assist in the determination of cp violation , and also determine the hierarchy of neutrinos .    in geer s",
    "seminal article it was pointed out that there are several improvements to neutrino beam experiments that could be achieved using neutrino factories .",
    "one improvement could be in the determination of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 fluxes since these are important sources of systematic errors .",
    "also a more `` pure '' beam could be obtained , since the @xmath6 is contaminated by @xmath5 from @xmath7 three body decay for neutrino beam experiments .",
    "all of this `` contamination '' makes it very difficult for the precision experimentation in neutrino oscillation physics .",
    "several proposals of neutrino factories have been made  @xcite , but its realization is still far from happening despite great effort and advances in research and development .",
    "recent reviews on neutrino factories and their possible capabilities and physical potentials can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the principle of lorentz invariance tells us that equations that describe some natural physical phenomena have the same structure in all reference frames .",
    "so , if we find some system with a violation of this principle , it would be evidence of new physics and the possibility for theoretical development in the understanding of the most basic physical laws .",
    "there are several proposals and tests involving lorentz invariance violation ( liv )  @xcite . for a very recent review on tests of liv in",
    "effective quantum field theories and the gravity sector , see  @xcite . despite this fact , we do not have compelling evidence of liv and its effects",
    "are supposed to be very small and suppressed by the planck scale ( @xmath8  gev ) .",
    "currently , we have limits on liv based on experiments with electrons , photons and neutrons , for example .",
    "existing limits can be found in  @xcite .",
    "generally , these limits are put in a framework called the standard - model extension ( sme )  @xcite which is an extension of the standard model with lorentz violating terms in the lagrangian . the recent global model for neutrino oscillations based on the sme",
    "has shown consistency with all compelling data from accelerator , atmospheric , reactor , and solar neutrino experiments and it even reproduces the anomalous low - energy excess observed in miniboone @xcite .",
    "neutrinos can play an important role in this liv picture  @xcite .",
    "one of the ways of determining the liv is by measuring the neutrino ( @xmath9 ) time of flight  @xcite .",
    "for example , this measurement was done by the minos experiment  @xcite , where they compared the detection times in the near and far detectors of 3  gev neutrino beams .",
    "the result was @xmath10 at 68% c.l .",
    "also , in a recent analysis , the opera experiment determined @xmath11 at 90% c.l  @xcite .",
    "two other experiments recently determined the neutrino velocity : icarus with @xmath12  ns @xcite and lvd with @xmath13 at 99% c.l  @xcite .",
    "another way to investigate liv is by making use of neutrino oscillations since there will be modifications in the energy - momentum relation of the particle and therefore its hamiltonian will be modified  @xcite .",
    "models of string theory and extra dimensions have also explored the liv possibility by the breaking of cpt symmetry .",
    "if cpt is violated , then there will be differences in the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos compared with the ones of antineutrinos .",
    "this possibility was investigated in the context of neutrino factories in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the modification in the total detected number of events ( @xmath0 ) by the introduction of the liv parameter in neutrino oscillations for a neutrino factory with @xmath3 muon decays per year localized at a distance of 7500  km from the detector .",
    "the muons are accelerated until they reach a momentum which varies from 10  gev / c to 50  gev / c . according to our calculations , modifications in the number of events",
    "can , in principle , happen when we consider the liv parameter not equal zero since there is a modification in the oscillation pattern .",
    "for the oscillation to be modified by the lorentz violating parameter , which we call @xmath14 , we must have @xmath15 .",
    "so taking a distance , @xmath16 , of 7500  km , for example , and an energy , @xmath17 , of about 10  gev , @xmath18 must be about @xmath2 . in this article",
    "we will choose @xmath19 and @xmath20 to compare with the standard situation : @xmath21 .",
    "the reason we do that choice is that they maximize the liv effect for the baseline chosen and the neutrino factory energy range .    this article is organized as follows . in sec",
    ".  [ production ] we present the main principles of the production of neutrinos in a neutrino factory . in sec .",
    "[ propagation ] and sec .",
    "[ detection ] , we describe the neutrino propagation and its interaction with matter on the earth including the liv parameter , culminating with its detection . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present our results by showing the number of events for scenarios including the liv parameter , @xmath4 , and also the standard situation with no lorenz violation ( @xmath22 ) . finally , we conclude our work in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , neutrino factories have basic concepts enumerated as followed : ( i ) a pion source which is produced by a multi - gev proton beam ( produced by a multi - mw proton source ) focused at a particular target ; ( ii ) secondary charged pions radially confined by a high - field target solenoid ; ( iii ) the production of positive and negative muons by the decay of pions in a long solenoidal channel ; ( iv ) the capture of muons by rf cavities and reductions in the spreading of energy ; and ( v ) a reduction of the transverse momentum of the muons in an ionization cooling channel .",
    "we are not going to discuss in detail the neutrino factory r&d . for more information about this ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in a general neutrino factory ,",
    "neutrinos are produced by @xmath23 decay .",
    "all flavors are produced in a neutrino factory , except @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we have the following decays : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the muon rest frame ,",
    "we can write the distribution of @xmath28 ( @xmath6 ) in the following expression  @xcite : @xmath29 , \\label{dist_nu_muon}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath17 represents the neutrino energy , @xmath31 is the muon rest mass , and @xmath32 is the angle between the neutrino momentum vector and the muon spin direction . in eq .",

    "( [ dist_nu_muon ] ) and ( [ dist_nu_e ] ) become @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will consider @xmath3 @xmath37 decays per year .",
    "the @xmath37 momentum in our neutrino factory will vary from 10  gev / c to 50  gev / c . in ref .",
    "@xcite there was a proposition of a very low energy neutrino factory , where the muon energy is about 2 - 4  gev and in  @xcite , sec .",
    "iii - iv , there is a discussion about the setup / optimization and the systematics of this low energy neutrino factory . a recent proposition of very low energy neutrino factory , with a initial beam energy of about 300  mev , called moment , was made in  @xcite .",
    "after the production , neutrinos will propagate through the earth and will travel a distance ( @xmath16 ) of about 7500  km , approximately the distance from fermilab to gran sasso . we know that those neutrinos will oscillate during their propagation and will suffer msw effects  @xcite .",
    "this baseline @xmath16 is usually known as the `` magic '' baseline  @xcite because it is the distance that , in principle , can help to solve the unknown neutrino mass ordering and improve , for example , the determination of @xmath38 . for previous research on the interactions with the matter from earth and its effects in very long baselines neutrino oscillations , such as neutrino factories ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the equation of evolution , in flavor basis and using natural units ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , is described by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the neutrino position .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath45 ) in this case includes the effects of matter from earth , represented by the function @xmath46 , which contains the charged current interactions of neutrinos with the electrons in earth : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fermi coupling constant ( @xmath49  gev@xmath50 ) and @xmath51 represents the electronic density , which depends on the neutrino position along its path . considering @xmath51 a spherically symmetric distribution ,",
    "the core and the mantle are the two main parts , as opposed to the other parts such as the shells and other layers .",
    "the earth s radius is about 6371  km and the core has a radius of 3486  km .",
    "the mantle has 2885  km of depth .",
    "the neutrino path through earth is determined by the nadir angle ( @xmath52 ) . for @xmath53 , or @xmath54  km",
    ", neutrinos will cross the core . since we are considering distances less than this particular value , our neutrino path crosses only the mantle region , which has an average density of @xmath55  @xmath56  @xcite , where @xmath57 is avogadro s number . as it was developed in  @xcite , because there is no significant change in the electronic density , we consider @xmath51 constant along the neutrino path and equal to the average : @xmath58 . from now on we are going to represent @xmath59 . for modifications in the oscillations using a non - constant profile",
    "see @xcite , where there are some changes in the oscillation probabilities , however they are only a few percent .",
    "we can write @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the pmns mixing matrix , characterized by four parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath38,and @xmath64 , the phase related to possible cp - violation .",
    "@xmath65 is the hamiltonian in the mass eigenstates basis , @xmath66 , and it is related to the liv modification , because for a general mass eigenstate , @xmath67 , we can write : @xmath68 where we considered @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the mass of each mass eigenstate , @xmath71 is their respective momentum , for @xmath72 , and @xmath17 represents the neutrino energy",
    ". the liv parameter is represented by @xmath14 in the first order approximation . for @xmath73",
    ", we recover the usual and standard dispersion relation for a neutrino in the ultra - relativistic approximation .",
    "this @xmath4 will represent a small perturbation in the dispersion relation when we break the lorentz invariance of some lagrangian .",
    "in other words , liv is produced during the propagation of the mass eigenstates , so each mass eigenstate will propagate with a different group velocity .",
    "mixing angles remain equal to the standard neutrino oscillation scenario ( @xmath22 ) and no drastic deviation happens from the current status of neutrino oscillation , since current data does not point to any clear evidence of liv .",
    "we also consider that , for simplicity , the liv parameter acts in the same way for neutrinos and antineutrinos . for a different theoretical scenario and a more advanced discussion ,",
    "see  @xcite . in this article",
    "we do not show any lagrangian with a lorentz breaking term , but we invite the reader to look for a more theoretical motivation of this kind of phenomena in  @xcite , for example .    in order to give more meaning to our liv parameter @xmath4",
    ", we will compare it with a particular case of the sme discussed in section 4.2.1 of  @xcite and detailed in  @xcite . in the isotropic approximation ( no lorentz violation from rotations ) and neglecting flavor information of the sme , the neutrino group velocity ( @xmath74 ) can be written as : @xmath75 for a generic mass @xmath76 and energy @xmath17 .",
    "the quantities @xmath77 are proportional to the isotropic liv coefficients of the sme and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the coefficient for lorentz violation related to the sme lagrangian . for simplicity",
    ", the following comparison will be done with @xmath80 .",
    "if we consider our dispertion relation in eq .",
    "( [ livdisp ] ) , the group velocity ( @xmath81 ) , for each mass eigenstate , can be written for our liv case as : @xmath82 so , if we compare eq .",
    "( [ mygroup ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ jsdiaz ] ) , @xmath83 .",
    "note that , by construction and assumptions , our @xmath4 is not explicitly dependent on energy and , for this reason , we neglected the terms @xmath77 in @xmath74 to do a fair comparison .",
    "the hamiltonian in the mass basis can be explicitly written as : @xmath84 for the distance considered and the energy range of the order of tens of gev , we can ignore the cp violation effects  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ liv_matrix ] ) , we consider , for simplicity , that the liv modifications are @xmath85 . also , @xmath86 , for @xmath87 .",
    "we can then consider the best - fit parameters of the oscillation parameters determined by  @xcite .",
    "based on the solar experiments and the kamland reactor @xmath33 , @xmath88  ev@xmath89 and @xmath90 are the best - fit values . for normal hierarchy ( nh ) , @xmath91  ev@xmath89 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . for inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , we use the following oscillation parameters : @xmath94  ev@xmath89 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "these parameters are fully summarized in table  [ tab_osc_par ] .",
    ".values of the best - fit oscillation parameters extracted from the bari group  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we analyzed the possible modifications in the number of events ( @xmath0 ) per year in a neutrino factory located 7500  km from a 10  kton detector .",
    "we introduced a parameter , @xmath4 , that breaks the lorentz invariant assumption .",
    "this can have consequences in the neutrino oscillation mechanisms and modify the number of events . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have shown that the modification in the number of events happens when one compares the standard case ( @xmath22 ) to the liv cases ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) for several muon momenta , both muon polarizations , and nh / ih .",
    "these parameter values were chosen considering the baseline and typical neutrino energies of a neutrino factory , since they generate clear modifications in the survival probabilities ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) and in the conversion probabilities ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) .",
    "if we consider a simplified version of the sme , considering an isotropical approximation ( no liv from rotations ) , the parameter @xmath4 of this work is comparable with the parameter @xmath103 , a dimension 4 operator , that controls neutrino oscillation in the channel of @xmath104 and does not promote cpt violation effect . considering data information from lsnd and miniboone , a maximum sensitivity of 10@xmath105 ( table s4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be found . for more details of the model and the evaluation of this liv parameter ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in the case of non - terrestrial experiments ,",
    "in  @xcite , for example , considering the @xmath106 oscillation channel and the super - kamiokande data of atmospheric neutrinos with a range of energy of about four decades , the standard scenario was confirmed as the dominant effect in neutrino oscillation and other terms that induce violations in relativity as subleading effects . with the inclusion of k2k data ,",
    "@xcite obtained the same conclusion . using the macro data of upward - moving muons of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ",  @xcite also found that liv is not favored by the atmospheric data , even as a subleading term in the oscillation mechanism . at 90% c.l .",
    "these works found , roughly speaking , that @xmath107 . despite the fact that atmospheric neutrinos disfavor liv in the neutrino oscillation context , the results in neutrino factories show that if we have a possible violation in the principle of lorentz invariance , this can be detected in a future neutrino factory , considering values of @xmath4  @xmath108 and @xmath2 in this present work  near of some of the upper limits experimentally determined by the results of atmospheric neutrinos ,",
    "whose flux is reasonably well understood : normalizations are known to 20% approximately ( 10% approximately for neutrino energies below 10  gev ) ; the ratio of fluxes are known to @xmath109 ; fluxes decay rapidly with neutrino energies of @xmath110  gev .",
    "so , considering that the known flux properties of atmospheric neutrinos have several uncertainties and the perspective of very clean signals in neutrino factories , neutrino factories in the future can achieve lower uncertainties and reveal the liv phenomenon or even put more stringent bounds on it considering the neutrino oscillation perspective .",
