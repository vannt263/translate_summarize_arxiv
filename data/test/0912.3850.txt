    "the search for @xmath0-rays from radio galaxies is important for the understanding of the dynamics and structure of jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "even though radio galaxies are agn with jets , their jet is not oriented toward the observer and therefore the radiation produced by the jet is not doppler - boosted towards higher energies and luminosities , making them more challenging to detect in the very high energy ( vhe : @xmath1  gev ) regime . the discovery of vhe @xmath0-rays from the radio galaxy m  87 by the hegra collaboration  @xcite , detected later by veritas  @xcite , and from ngc  5128 ( centaurus  a ) by the hess collaboration  @xcite has shown that non - blazar agn can produce very energetic photons from non - thermal processes .",
    "radio galaxies are classified into two main families based on the morphology of their radio emission  @xcite , whether it is core dominated ( fr  i ) or lobe dominated ( fr  ii ) , with differences in the radio energetics and in the discrete spectral properties  @xcite . the large number of features that fr  i radio galaxies share with bl lac type blazars suggests a possible unification between the two sub - classes of agn , in which fr i radio galaxies are bl lac objects observed at larger jet viewing angles  @xcite .",
    "evidence for synchrotron emission in radio to x - ray energies from both the extended structures and the core is well explained by relativistic particles moving in a beamed relativistic jet  @xcite . a commonly considered mechanism for he - vhe ( he : high energy , 100  mev@xmath2100  gev ) radiation is the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) process  @xcite , where the optical and uv synchrotron photons are up - scattered by the same relativistic electrons in the jet",
    ". predictions concerning the inverse compton ( ic ) component have long been established for the @xmath0-ray emission  @xcite and frequency - dependent variability  @xcite . besides leptonic scenarios ,",
    "several models also consider a hadronic origin for non - thermal emission in jets . accelerated protons",
    "can initiate electromagnetic cascades or photomeson processes  @xcite , or directly emit synchrotron radiation @xcite and produce @xmath0-rays through collisions with ambient gas @xcite .    modelling",
    "the blazar jet emission with a homogeneous ssc mechanism may imply particularly high lorentz factors , @xmath3 , with consequent high doppler factors and small beaming angles @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such a small beaming angle is in conflict with the unification scheme according to which fr  i radio galaxies and bl  lac objects are the same kind of object observed at different viewing angles .",
    "moreover , these high values for the doppler factor are in disagreement with the small apparent velocities observed in the sub - parsec region of the tev bl lac objects mrk  421 and mrk  501 @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest a more complicated geometry , for example a decelerating flow in the jet with a consequent gradient in the lorentz factor of the accelerated particles and a smaller average @xmath5 @xcite . as a result of this gradient ,",
    "the fast upstream particles interact with the downstream seed photons with an amplified energy density , because of the doppler boost due to the relative lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "the ic process then requires less extreme values for the lorentz factor and allows larger values for the beaming angle . in a similar way , a jet spine - sheath structure consisting of a faster internal spine surrounded by a slower layer has been also suggested for the broadband non - thermal emission of vhe bl lac objects  @xcite .",
    "an inhomogeneous jet with a slow component may explain the he - vhe emission observed in radio galaxies at larger angles ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "observation of the vhe component from radio galaxies is therefore significant for the agn jet modeling . in this work an overview of the observations of radio galaxies by veritas",
    "is presented .",
    "ngc  1275 ( perseus  a , 3c  84 ) is a nearby radio galaxy located in the center of the perseus cluster .",
    "it is one of the most unusual early - type galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "its radio emission is core dominated , but it also has strong emission lines . in addition , the emission line system shows a double structure , corresponding to both a high - velocity and a low - velocity system .",
    "the puzzling nature of ngc  1275 makes it difficult to definitively classify it in a standard agn sub - class .",
    "it has been recently detected in high energy @xmath0-rays by _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , with a flux between 100  mev and 25  gev described by a power law with photon index @xmath8 .",
    "veritas observed the source between january and february 2009 for a total amount of good - quality data of 7.8  hours .",
    "fermi_-lat data simultaneous to the veritas observational campaign have been analyzed , reporting a lower flux by a factor of 1.37 and a similar photon index @xmath9 compared to the 2008 published _",
    "fermi_-lat spectrum .",
    "a differential upper limit at the decorrelation energy of  340  gev is calculated and is incompatible with an extrapolation of the _ fermi _ measured spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1275 ] ) .",
    "a deviation from the power - law regime is therefore a likely explanation .",
    "three possible models have been considered : a power law with an exponential cutoff , with a sub - exponential cutoff and a broken power law , all rising from different electron energy distributions in the jet as the absorption by the extra - galactic background light ( ebl ) is excluded due to the proximity of the galaxy .",
    "the three possibilities are equally compatible with the veritas upper limit .",
    "the estimated cutoff energies are @xmath10  gev and @xmath11  gev in the case of an exponential and sub - exponential cutoff respectively , and @xmath12  gev in the case of a broken power law .",
    "for details of the analysis see  @xcite .",
    "the result of the observation is rather interesting .",
    "it shows , for the first time , that there can be a deviation from the power - law regime in a radio - galaxy spectrum at an energy of the order of @xmath13  gev or lower .",
    "this is the first example of a scientific result obtained by veritas in conjunction with _",
    "fermi_.          3c",
    "111 is a near ( @xmath14 ) fr - ii radio source whose central component is coincident with a broad - line seyfert  1 galaxy .",
    "the radio morphology shows a double - lobe / single - jet structure with the jet emerging at an angle of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the central component is variable on time scales of a few months .",
    "hints of superluminal behaviour are observed  @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum is flat with an index of @xmath16 between 6  cm and 80  cm  @xcite .",
    "strong emission is detected in the mm and infra - red bands too  @xcite . in the x - ray band , 3c",
    "111 has been detected by many instruments with a long - term variability within a factor of 5  @xcite .",
    "the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shows a double - peaked structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c111 ] right ) with typical blazar - like features and the source has been suggested to be a misaligned blazar  @xcite .    the radio galaxy 3c  111 has been suggested as a counterpart for the unidentified egret @xmath0-ray source 3eg  j0416 + 3650  @xcite .",
    "this is a @xmath0-ray source located at @xmath17 , i.e. close to the galactic plane , with a 95% confidence error radius of 38.2 .",
    "however , since the optical position of the radio galaxy is outside the 99% confidence level contour of the egret @xmath0-ray source ( @xmath18  arcmin separation ) , the probability of the association between the two sources is rather low ( @xmath19 )  @xcite",
    ".    however , additional hint supporting the association between 3c  111 and 3eg  j0416 + 3650 can be found in  @xcite . due to the large uncertainty on the egret @xmath0-ray source position , 12  x - ray and radio sources can be found inside the @xmath20 confinement error box  ( see fig .  [ fig:3c111 ] left ) . nevertheless , the radio galaxy 3c  111 is among the 12 sources the only object that is known to emit both in radio and x - rays , with the hardest and strongest x - ray flux .    the @xmath21 detection reported by egret with an average flux above 100  mev of with a simple power - law photon index @xmath22 makes this @xmath0-ray source interesting for an instrument like veritas .",
    "if detected , given its higher angular resolution , veritas would be able to definitely identify the @xmath0-ray emitter with the underlying object .",
    "veritas observed the radio galaxy 3c  111 during fall 2008 at a zenith angle range between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "all data taken under bad weather conditions or with technical problems have been discharged .",
    "finally , a total amount of about 11  hours has remained for analysis purposes .",
    "no vhe signal has been detected , a 99% confidence level upper limit above the analysis threshold of 300  gev has been derived .",
    "the result is reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "m  87 is a radio galaxy located in the virgo cluster at a distance of 16  mpc  @xcite .",
    "originally detected at tev energies at 4 sigma significance by hegra  @xcite and finally detected over 5 sigma by hess  @xcite , it has been later detected also by veritas  @xcite .",
    "the substructures of the jet are well studied in the x - ray , optical and radio wavelengths  @xcite , with an estimated angle of @xmath25 toward the line of sight .",
    "its proximity and spatially - resolved structures at all wavelengths make m  87 a unique laboratory to study the jet physics , especially for the related mechanisms to the vhe @xmath0-rays production .",
    "given its peculiarity , an extensive veritas - led coordinated multi - wavelength observational campaign , involving all major imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) currently operating , veritas , magic and hess , and othe x - ray and radio instruments , namely chandra and vlba , has been performed in 2008 .",
    "correlation studies of this broad - band observational campaign resulted in the identification of the region responsible for the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated contribution has been therefore presented at this symposium  @xcite .",
    "veritas observed three radio galaxies during the last two years . only in one case , the already - known @xmath0-ray emitter m  87 , the observation resulted in a vhe @xmath0-ray emission detection .",
    "given the peculiarity of the radio galaxy m  87 , that makes it a unique laboratory for the study of the blazar astrophysics , in particular for the jet - related processes , veritas coordinated an observational campaign together with the major iact partners and other x - ray and radio partners .",
    "the broad - band observational campaign resulted in the discovery of the region responsible of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the observation of other two radio galaxies , 3c  111 and ngc  1275 , did not result in a vhe detection .",
    "however , a joint work together with _ fermi_-lat on ngc  1275 resulted in the identification of a variation from the power - law regime at an energy of the order of @xmath26  gev or lower , a previously unknown feature of radio - galaxies @xmath0-ray component .",
    ".veritas upper limits on the observed radio galaxies vhe flux .",
