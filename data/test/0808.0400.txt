    "finally a few words about the differences between our calculation and that of ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite identify the coefficient of @xmath39 with the yukawa coupling ( which they denote as @xmath63 ) , since that is the result of casting the deformed classical superspace action into its component form .",
    "they also introduce @xmath64 and @xmath65 terms ( we have added the prime to distinguish from our own @xmath66 , @xmath67 which have a different meaning ) .",
    "therefore , we should be able to read off their results for individual diagrams from tables [ taba]-[tabd ] by writing k_12g(c ) , & & k_58 ^ 2k_2(c ) , k_88 ^ 3k_1(c ) , 2 , & & y2g,2[subst ] ( including appropriate adjustments for our differing conventions ) , setting the remaining @xmath68 to zero , and remembering the factors of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ divdef ] ) .",
    "indeed , our results then agree precisely with those from their eq .",
    "however , the difference between our results and theirs appears in the two - loop @xmath57-functions .",
    "both we and they eventually derive results in which @xmath42 and @xmath46 are effectively identified . taking account of the differences in our definitions , we might expect that our eliminated results would be equivalent to theirs under _ 1 g , [ comp ] where their @xmath69 is a dimensionless coupling associated with @xmath70 . however , it is clear that the @xmath57-functions for our @xmath71 and their @xmath69 are in agreement at one loop but not at two loops .",
    "of course it is well - known that @xmath57-functions are scheme - dependent ( i.e. dependent on the renormalisation used ) beyond one loop in general .",
    "the change from one scheme to another may be effected by a redefinition of the couplings of the theory .",
    "nevertheless , we do not believe that the difference betwen our two - loop @xmath57-function and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is a consequence of using different renormalisation schemes ; both we and they are using dimensional regularisation and indeed as we mentioned , our results for individual diagrams agree precisely with theirs , confirming that they correspond to the same renormalisation scheme .",
    "in fact , the difference resides in the precise way of identifying @xmath42 and @xmath46 . in our case",
    "this is through eliminating @xmath42 and @xmath40 via their equations of motion eq .",
    "( [ felim ] ) .",
    "one might worry that this equation is only valid at the classical level ; but we have shown in detail that we get the same results by eliminating @xmath42 and @xmath40 at the classical level ( hence using the classical version of eq .  ( [ felim ] ) ) and then renormalising the eliminated theory ; or renormalising the uneliminated theory and then eliminating @xmath42 and @xmath40 in the renormalised theory ( hence using the bare version of eq .",
    "( [ felim ] ) ) .",
    "this equivalence is expressed by eq .",
    "( [ consistb ] ) .",
    "there seems little doubt therefore that our procedure is consistent .",
    "moreover there is ample evidence in the literature ( at least in the undeformed case ) that the same results ( for renormalisation constants , @xmath57-functions etc ) hold in the eliminated theory obtained by applying the classical equations of motion , as for the uneliminated theory ( where calculations are usually performed in superfields of course ) . the renormalisation eq .",
    "( [ fren ] ) could be regarded as leading to a quantum modification of the equations of motion for @xmath42 , but we have seen that it has no effect upon the eliminated theory .    on the other hand , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite identify @xmath46 and @xmath42 through a different , and inequivalent , process , which involves reassessing the identification diagrammatically at each loop level .",
    "it seems possible that both approaches are internally consistent , but that the eliminated theories thereby obtained are simply different at the quantum level .",
    "both approaches lead to consistent two - loop double poles , at least as far as has been computed ; it is only the simple poles ( and hence the @xmath57-functions ) which differ .",
    "let us explain in detail how this happens ( and from now on for ease of comparison we shall describe the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite using our own notation ) .",
    "since these authors identify @xmath42 and @xmath46 immediately , they do not introduce separate couplings for ( for instance ) @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 in order to cancel all the different divergent terms ; instead they identify all these terms with @xmath75 ( up to factors ) and omit @xmath76 .",
    "the subtlety is that they identify @xmath77 with @xmath78 ( and presumably @xmath74 with @xmath79 ) .",
    "this means that they effectively make the replacement _ 1 & & _",
    "1+_2 + 12_3 + 16_4,_i&&0 , i=2,3,4,k_i&&0 , i=2,3,4 .",
    "[ substa ] now in the `` eliminated '' case , both we and they agree that the double poles in @xmath80 are as given by eq .",
    "( [ consista ] ) ( equivalent to their eq .",
    "( 6.5 ) ) . on the other hand , since they are starting from the uneliminated calculation , they are deriving @xmath80 by assuming eq .",
    "( [ consistb ] ) , and therefore their double poles in @xmath80 are given ( as are ours ) according to eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) ( but in their case , after applying eq .",
    "( [ substa ] ) ) . how can we and they obtain the same double poles despite using different @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) ?",
    "it happens as follows : effectively , through eq .",
    "( [ substa ] ) they have reduced @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) by @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is zero in this comparison since we are setting @xmath85 ) ; and meanwhile the @xmath86 from @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ zonea ] ) ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 being zero for @xmath85 ) is effectively transferred to @xmath90 which , crucially , has a different factor in eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) from @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out that these two alterations have no effect on the double pole in @xmath80 , but change the simple pole and hence the two - loop @xmath57-function for @xmath71 ( or equivalently @xmath69 ) .",
    "however it should be said that their different means of identifying @xmath42 and @xmath46 at higher loops means that the identification of @xmath71 and @xmath69 is perhaps problematic at higher loops ; and there is therefore no clear translation between our results and theirs beyond one loop .",
    "we have performed a complete analysis up to two loops of the renormalisation of the non - anticommutative wess - zumino model .",
    "we have shown that in the uneliminated case it is necessary to include all the possible terms which can be generated by renormalisation with their own couplings , and that this leads to results equivalent to those obtained in the eliminated theory .",
    "in particular , if one seeks renormalisation - group invariant trajectories for the couplings in the uneliminated theory , one obtains essentially the same solutions as in the eliminated theory ; although there are two interesting special solutions for which the uneliminated action adopts a simple form and which require no non - linear renormalisation of the auxiliary fields , at least up to two loops . it would be interesting to see if this behaviour persists to all orders ; and also to perform a similar analysis for a gauged model .    in the wider context ,",
    "some of the earliest investigations of supersymmetry were motivated by the hope that theories might be found which were non - renormalisable by naive power counting and yet nevertheless renormalisable in requiring only a finite number of local counter - terms to create a uv - finite effective action .",
    "thanks to the pseudo - symmetries eqs .",
    "( [ psea ] ) , ( [ pseb ] ) the theory studied here ( and indeed its generalisation to a gauge theory ) provides an explicit realisation of this phenomenon .",
    "it is tempting ( but presumably fanciful ) to speculate on a connection with the recent suggestions@xcite that @xmath91 supergravity ( similarly naively non - renormalisable ) might in fact be finite . in any event",
    "we believe these theories deserve further investigation .",
