    "at x - ray energies , the extra - solar sky is dominated by the emission from accreting binary systems . however , at higher energies ( gev to tev ) very few binary systems are known to be sources ( e.g. holder 2009 ) .",
    "the emission mechanisms of gamma - ray binaries are still unclear .",
    "the principal models proposed are that either the gamma - ray emission could originate from relativistic jets generated by accretion onto a neutron star or black hole ( `` microquasars '' ) or be due to the interaction between the relativistic wind coming from a pulsar and the stellar wind of its companion .",
    "we are investigating techniques to obtain lat light curves with increased signal - to - noise levels and search for periodic modulation of the gamma - ray flux which would be a strong indicator that the source is a binary system .",
    "the usual way to search for periodic variability is to use a periodogram ( e.g. scargle 1982 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the periodogram for the detection of a periodic signal strongly depends on the signal strength compared to the noise level : the probability of a peak in the periodogram reaching or exceeding a value `` z '' scales as exp(-z ) when the periodogram is normalized by the variance of the data set .",
    "small changes in signal - to - noise can thus result in large significance changes in a power spectrum .",
    "in the optical and x - ray wavebands aperture photometry is relatively straightforward .",
    "although the ideal aperture to use may depend on source brightness , the point spread function ( psf ) typically has little energy dependence and minor dependence on the source location in the field of view .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a single observation will be given by : snr = s/(s + b)@xmath0 , where s is the number of source photons and b is the number of background photons .",
    "in the optical it is generally relatively easy to determine the aperture at which the snr is greatest ( e.g. howell 1989 ) . for the fermi",
    "lat the situation is more difficult since the psf depends strongly on energy . in addition , the background , both from other sources and the galactic plane , is complex .",
    "the usual alternative to aperture photometry for lat data is to use maximum likelihood fitting ( the equivalent of profile fitting in the optical ) .",
    "however , this procedure is both very compute intensive and can also be problematic when few or zero photons are detected in a time bin .",
    "we are developing tools to determine the ideal aperture size and energy range to use for any source .",
    "these tools take into account the cataloged spectrum of the source of interest , potentially contaminating nearby sources , and emission from the galactic plane .",
    "once apertures and energy ranges have been determined , aperture photometry will then be generated for all cataloged lat sources .",
    "we choose to analyze all sources , not just those thought most likely to be gamma - ray binaries .",
    "this ensures that a misclassified gamma - ray binary will not be missed .",
    "a large fraction of the light curves will be of agns and we will provide our light curves to the community as a general service .",
    "we use discrete fourier transforms and lomb - scargle analyses to search for the periodic modulation that is expected to be a signature of a gamma - ray binary .",
    "evaluating the probability that each individual photon came from a specific source should give the maximum possible snr .",
    "this is being investigated for pulsars by kerr ( 2009 ) and will later be expanded to other types of sources .      as an intermediate step between optimal apertures and photon weighting we are also investigating the snr gain provided by obtaining light curves in several energy bands with different aperture sizes at each energy band .",
    "i.e. smaller apertures at higher energies where the psf is smaller .",
    "these light curves can then be combined together with appropriate weighting into an overall light curve .",
    "this technique has some similarities to naylor s ( 1989 ) `` optimal photometry '' method .",
    "figures [ lsi61-app ] to [ sim4-app ] show the dependence of a peak in the power spectrum at the orbital period for both observations of modulation in actual sources ( 61 and ls 5039 ; figures [ lsi61-app ] and [ ls5039-app ] ) and for simulations using ` gtobssim ` ( figures [ sim1-app ] to [ sim4-app ] ) .",
    "these illustrate some of the dependencies of optimal aperture size on source spectrum and the level of background .",
    "for fermi light curves the exposure of time bins is not necessarily uniform .",
    "for example , if the time bin size is a lot shorter than the survey repeat time , then there can be extreme differences in the exposure of the time bins .",
    "scargle ( 1989 ) noted that the effect of unequally weighted data points in the calculation of a periodogram could be understood by considering the combination of points that coincide in time .",
    "this leads to an analogy between a weighted power spectrum and the weighted mean .",
    "however , although the procedure to calculate a weighted periodogram is straightforward , it is important that the correct weights are chosen .",
    "for example , if source variability is significant compared to the typical errors on data points then a procedure based on the semi - weighted mean of cochran ( 1937 , 1954 ) is more generally applicable ( corbet et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .    for lat light curves",
    "the number of photons in a time bin is typically extremely small .",
    "if a weight is chosen based on the number of counts in a bin , then bins with the same exposure could receive different weighting .",
    "the number of photons for the same underlying count rate will exhibit variations due to poisson fluctuations and a weighting based on this would also have noise due to this shot noise .",
    "for lat light curves we therefore use weighting factors based on the relative exposure of the time bins .",
    "we calculate the mean count rate of all bins and then calculate the number of counts expected in each bin based on its exposure .",
    "we adopt an effective error for each bin which is the square root of the number of predicted photons divided by the exposure .",
    "the gain in sensitivity using weighting is illustrated in figure [ power - plot ] where we show the power spectrum of the light curve of 61(abdo et al .",
    "2009a ) calculated in several different ways .",
    "the bottom panel shows the power spectrum of a one day time resolution light curve without using weighting . in this case",
    "the exposure of the time bins is fairly uniform and the orbital period of the system is readily detected . in the other panels are shown power spectra of 61using 1,000 s time bins .",
    "it can be seen that without weighting the periodicity is not detectable . even if weighting based on the number of photons in a time bin ( `` error weighting '' )",
    "is used negligible gain in signal at the orbital period is obtained . * for weighting based on the exposure ( `` exposure weighting '' )",
    "the signal strength is comparable to that obtained with one day binning , but provides higher time resolution .",
    "* we note that although the exposure weighted power spectrum of the count rate has some mathematical similarity with just taking the power spectrum of the number of counts in a time bin , that procedure produces large artifacts at fermi s rocking period and its harmonics . the use of exposure weighting has been employed to enable the detection of the 4.8 hour orbital period of cygnus x-3 ( abdo et al . 2009b , corbel 2009 ) .",
