    "the partially conserved axial vector current ( pcac ) relationship and corresponding current algebra results are in conformity with experimental data within a few percent .",
    "this good agreement between theory and experiments is interpreted as due to an underlying approximate chiral @xmath2 symmetry , which is explicitly broken down by up and down current quark masses of a few mev much smaller than the hadronic mass scale of 1 gev .",
    "the lightest hadronic particle pions are considered as , in the limit that the current masses of the up and down quarks vanish , the goldstone bosons of a spontaneous breaking down of the above mentioned symmetry induced by a non  vanishing vacuum expectation value of the quark field bilinear operator @xmath3 , namely @xmath4 .",
    "equipped with new information on the momentum transfer dependence of one of the axial vector form factors @xmath5 @xcite , we provide a refined analysis of the old results , which are based on an extrapolation of the physical quantities to @xmath6 @xcite , to include a wider range of momentum transfer , and , may be more interestingly , to explore possible extensions that are observable and are nevertheless consistent with our present knowledge .",
    "the possibility of the formation of a superconducting phase in a massless fermionic system , which is a realization of one of the possible phases in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down to an isospin symmetry , is investigated in ref .",

    "it is argued that the relativistic superconducting phase might be relevant to the creation of baryons in the early universe due to its quantum mechanical nature .",
    "if this scenario reflects the nature at least at a qualitative level , it would be of interest to study the possible existence of such a phase in the hadronic system at the present day condition . since it is unlikely that the present day strong interaction vacuum at large scale is in the superconducting phase for reasons given in the following , the only regions where the superconducting phase can be found are inside a nucleon , a nucleus , the center region of a heavy ion collision , and an astronomical object like a neutron star , a quasar , etc .",
    "albeit the possible superconducting phase in the baryon creation era of the early universe may have had disappeared entirely at certain previous time during the evolution of the universe , it is still a worthwhile effort to search for such a phase at the present time .",
    "one of the reasons is that if such a phase can be found , its properties can be studied in domestic laboratories .",
    "its existence is a reasonable possibility since it is shown @xcite that given suitable coupling constants , the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) phase in which @xmath4 changes into a superconducting phase as the baryon ( or quark ) density is raised .",
    "the empirical need for such an assumption will be discussed in the conclusion parts of the paper rather than in this section since most of the individual phenomenon considered has its own explanation in terms of conventional picture with various degrees of success .",
    "we are interested in a search for a consistent explanation of the observatoins .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we explore some of the phenomenological consequences of a possibility in which the interior of a nucleon contains diquark condensation @xcite , which is enhanced in a nucleus , that spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry .",

    "in which the nucleons are close together , the effects of the diquark condensation and goldstone diquarks are expected to be enhanced .",
    "the enhancement of the diquark condensation can be attributed to the increase of the volume and baryon density of the system ; the enhancement of the effects of the goldstone diquarks is due to their coupling to the pions outside the nucleons .",
    "these effects could shed some light on the question @xcite of missing pions , quark number depletion in a nucleus and violation of gottfried sum rule @xcite in a nucleon . due to the novel nature of the superconducting phenomena in a relativistic massless fermion system ,",

    "it is the question of overall consistency rather than fitting of a single experimental observation that prevent us from doing so here .",

    ", the effects of diquark condensation are expected to be enhanced ; this in general produces the depletion of quark number observed in the emc effects in a nucleus , which is related to a ( enhanced ) violation of gottfried sum rule in the picture given here , since the antiquark components in a nucleus is known to be small in experimental observations @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the emc effects are still not well understood @xcite .    a detailed study of the effects of these soft longitudinal modes and that of spreading of the isoscalar part of the charge of constituent quarks is beyond the scope of this paper .",
