    "magnetic fields are unexpected in hot , massive stars due to the lack of convection in their outer envelopes . however , a small number of massive b stars host strong , organized magnetic fields , such as the chemically peculiar he strong stars like the archetypical star @xmath0  ori  e and the recently discovered b2v star hr  7355 ( oksala et al . 2010 ; rivinius et al .",
    "these stars are rapidly rotating and host strong magnetic fields that are coupled to a co - rotating magnetosphere ( townsend , owocki , groote 2005 ) .",
    "twenty - one high - resolution ( @xmath1 ) observations of the variable b2v star hr5907 were obtained with the espadons spectropolarimeter at the canada - france - hawaii telescope between february and august 2010 .",
    "these initial observations clearly show the presence of zeeman signatures in the circular polarization , stokes @xmath2 least - squares deconvolved ( lsd ) , mean line profiles , indicative of a magnetic field .",
    "we have also obtained six low - resolution eso - vlt fors polarimetric observations in addition to 27 uves observations in april 2010 to follow up the espadons observations and to further study the line - profile variability .",
    "equivalent width measurements ( right ) for hr5907 .",
    "different colours correspond to the different instruments ( red = espadons , blue = fors , green = uves).,width=600 ]    using hipparcos photometry , we find a single - wave period of @xmath3d ( see fig .",
    "[ sidebyside ] ) , which differs from the double - wave photometric light curve of hr7355 or @xmath0  ori e , likely indicating a different geometry of the magnetic field . from our longitudinal magnetic field measurements ,",
    "we confirm this period , which we take to be the rotational period of this star ( see fig .",
    "[ sidebyside ] ) , making it the fastest rotating , non - degenerate , magnetic massive star ! however , the period is sufficiently imprecise that the relative phasing between our current data and the hipparcos data can be offset by so much as 0.5 cycles .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a period of 0.50833d so that the relative phasing between the photometric minimum and the peak of the longitudinal field curve differs by 0.5 cycles - consistent with the predictions of semi - analytical models for a rotationally supported magnetosphere ( townsend 2008 ; townsend & owocki 2005 ) .    from nlte model fits to the espadons spectra ( shown in fig .",
    "[ nlte_fit ] ) , we find that @xmath4kk , @xmath5 , and @xmath6kms@xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the photometric and magnetic periodicity , we also find that h@xmath8 varies with the same period , as illustrated by the equivalent width variations shown in fig .",
    "[ sidebyside ] .",
    "h@xmath8 shows line profile variations of emission extending to high velocities , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ha_dyn ] .",
    "the double - lobed pattern and equivalent width variations strongly suggests that hr5907 hosts a structured magnetosphere similar to @xmath0  ori  e and hr7355 consisting of co - rotating , magnetically confined clouds of stellar wind plasma .",

    "assuming rigid rotation , we infer that the inclination @xmath9 . from fits to the longitudinal field curve shown in fig .  [ sidebyside ] we estimate that hr5907 hosts a mainly dipole magnetic field , with a strength at its pole of @xmath10 kg , and a magnetic axis nearly aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "preliminary fits of a dipole model to the lsd profiles at each individual phase seems to confirm this estimate , as shown in fig .",

    "[ lsd_fits ] is an illustration of how the magnetic field and circumstellar environment of a star with a similar rotation rate and similar magnetic field configuration would appear edge - on .",
    "currently , the inclination is poorly constrained , which results in a large possible range for the dipole field strength . however , using the predictions of the rigidly rotating magnetosphere model ( townsend & owocki 2005 ) , we expect to better constrain the geometry of hr5907 based on the variations shown in fig .",
