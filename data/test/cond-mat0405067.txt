    "walter harrison developed an elegant analytic theory of the electronic structure of solids @xcite .",
    "this theory has been very sucessful in providing a physical understanding of the electronic structure and the characteristics of bonding .",
    "however , harrison s theory of solid state has limited ability to produce accurate numerical results for the band structure , density of states and the relative stability of different crystal structures .    in this work , we have set out to put harrison s approach on a quantitative foundation .",
    "we have now realized that it is possible to put the slater - koster parameters in the form given by harrison but with new prefactors and determine new onsite parameters .",
    "the result is that we retain the universality of harrison s parameters , which means the same prefactors for all transition , alkaline earth and noble metals , but with different onsite terms for each element .",
    "it is clear to us that this approach , perhaps slightly modified , may be extended to cover the rest of the periodic table .",
    "we have also succeeded with a small number of additional parameters to describe the volume and structure dependence of the energy bands and , therefore , obtain total energies and predictions of relative stability .",
    "harrison has opted for simplicity in the lcao approach and has created a set of universal hopping parameters that can easily be used to perform calculations . in the tables of his books ,",
    "harrison uses atomic energies as onsite parameters in his hamiltonians , which is the main shortcoming of directly using these tables , to perform sufficiently accurate band structure calculations . however , harrison pointed out(@xcite , p561 ) that atomic values for the d - state energies need to be corrected for differences in d - state occupancy , and gave a way for doing that in the case of cr .",
    "we illustrate the importance of correcting the values of the onsite parameters for the transition metals nb and pd by using harrison s hopping parameters and uncorrected atomic term values .",
    "we compared the results of a @xmath0 harrison hamiltonian(without @xmath1 orbitals ) as given in harrison s book and we found that the energy bands created this way are in serious disagreement with augmented plane wave(apw ) results ( see left fig .  [ har_band_fit ] ) .",
    "we also tested a @xmath2(with @xmath1 orbitals ) harrison hamiltonian with all hopping prefactors kept at harrison s values , but the onsite parameters modified by fitting the energy bands to apw calculations .",
    "@xcite this modification gave us better results in the @xmath3bands , but there was still a large error for the s - like first band(see right fig .",
    "[ har_band_fit ] ) .",
    "our conclusion is that harrison s theory can only give a qualitative description of the band structure of the transition metals even if we fit the onsite terms to first - principles results .",

    ", width=144,height=172 ]",
    "we have developed a procedure that while maintaining the simplicity of harrison s approach gives an impressive improvement that puts the theory on a quantitative basis . to accomplish this",
    "we have made the following modifications to harrison s theory : ( 1 ) we introduced a @xmath1 onsite energy as an additional parameter to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 onsite energies used by harrison , and fit them all to apw results .",
    "( 2 ) we modified the @xmath6 hopping integrals of harrison , by introducing a dimensionless parameter @xmath7 as follows : @xmath8 the parameter @xmath7 provides more flexibility to fit the first and sixth bands .",
    "( 3 ) we obtained new hopping prefactors by simultaneously fitting the apw energy bands of the following 12 transition metals : v , cr , ni , cu , nb , mo , pd , ag , ta , w , pt and au . in this fit ,",
    "all 12 elements have the same common prefactors @xmath9 but different(for each element ) onsite energies s , p and d , and also different values for the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath10 that appear in the hopping parameters .",
    "our hamiltonian corresponds to an orthognal basis set as in harrison .",
    "we did the above fitting at the equilibrium lattice constants of the structure , which is the ground state of each element , and included interactions of nearest , second - nearest , and third - nearest neighbors for the @xmath11 structure and nearest and second - nearest for the @xmath12 structure . of course , using more neighbors than harrison did in the fit would automatically make changes in the parameters , even if one were fitting the same bands . using the parameters determined with the above procedure , we reproduced apw energy bands and density of states(dos ) remarkably well , not only for the 12 elements originally fitted , but also for the rest of the transition metals , the alkaline earth and the noble metals , as seen in fig .",
    "[ bands_we ] and fig .",
    "[ dos_we ] for four of the elements .",
    "our new hamiltonian prefactors , common for all metals , together with harrison s original prefactors are shown in table  [ we_sst ] .",
    "the onsite terms and the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath10 for each element are shown in table  [ onsite ] .    .",
    "harrison s hopping prefactors and our modified values .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to recapitulate , we have accomplished two goals . in the first we have reevaluated the ten universal prefactors in harrison s hopping parameters and redetermined the @xmath13 onsite energies together with the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "this enables us to calculate very accurately the band structure of all the transition , alkaline earth and noble metals . for the second goal we have used a polynomial form for the onsite energies which , with the addition of 15 new parameters , provides a total energy capability for our modified harrison theory"
