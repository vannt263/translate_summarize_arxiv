    "the study of collective flow in nuclear collisions at high energies has been attracting increasing attention from experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "this is partly because recent progress has been made in the development of new techniques suitable for flow studies at high energies  @xcite . instead of studying @xmath0 , in these new methods",
    "a fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of particles is used in which the first harmonic coefficient , @xmath1 , quantifies the directed flow and the second harmonic coefficient , @xmath2 , quantifies the elliptic flow . in some cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 were reported , which in modern terminology , are twice the square of the sub - event resolution . using",
    "these new techniques anisotropic flow has now been observed for heavy symmetric systems at both the ags and sps .    at the ags",
    "the e877 collaboration pioneered the use of the fourier expansion method to measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they studied these quantities ( as well as @xmath5 ) from a calorimeter as a function of centrality in different pseudorapidity windows  @xcite .",
    "then they studied nucleons as well as pions as a function of pseudorapidity for different centralities  @xcite . using their spectrometer to identify particles",
    "while still obtaining the event plane from the calorimeter , they measured @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of @xmath6 for different rapidities and centralities  @xcite .",
    "they also reported @xmath0 as a function of rapidity  @xcite . in their latest papers they extended this study to light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the e802 collaboration studied @xmath0 for light nuclei in the target rapidity region using a forward hodoscope to determine the event plane  @xcite .    at the sps na49 first observed elliptic flow in a calorimeter study which reported @xmath4 as a function of centrality  @xcite .",
    "wa98 reported @xmath3 as a function of centrality for protons and @xmath7 in the target rapidity region  @xcite .",
    "they also studied @xmath0 in the target rapidity region  @xcite . na45 used silicon drift detectors to study @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of pseudorapidity  @xcite .",
    "na49 has presented a differential study of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath8  @xcite and has also started to study the centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "also , the importance of flow for other measurements has just begun to be studied . for two particle correlations relative to the event plane",
    "the mathematical scheme has been worked out  @xcite .",
    "some first results have been given by wa98  @xcite .",
    "also , for non - identical particles the correlation relative to the event plane has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic flow , in particular elliptic flow , in spite of the relatively small absolute value of the effect , contains very rich physics . in general words",
    ", it is very sensitive to the equation of state which governs the evolution of the system created in the nuclear collision .",
    "being such , anisotropic flow provides important information on the state of matter under the extreme conditions of the nuclear collision .",
    "the anticipated phase transition to qgp should have a dramatic effect on elliptic flow due to the softening of the equation of state .",
    "first it was pointed out in the pioneering work of ollitrault@xcite , who suggested elliptic anisotropy as a possible signature of transverse collective flow . within the hydro - dynamical model ollitrault analyzed the role of different equations of state and phase transitions on the final anisotropy",
    ". hung and shuryak  @xcite suggested scanning with beam energy in order to look for the qcd phase transition .",
    "using their idea of the softest point in the equation of state combined with hydro - dynamical calculations , rischke  @xcite predicted a dramatic drop in the elliptic flow signal at the corresponding beam energies ( in the original calculations this was at ags energies ) .",
    "sorge has shown@xcite that the elliptic flow is very sensitive to the pressure at maximum compression , which is the most interesting time in the system evolution .",
    "recent studies  @xcite within the parton cascade model yield similar conclusions providing also the relation between the strength of the elliptic flow and parton - parton cross sections .",
    "recently , sorge also tried  @xcite to combine the early system evolution in accordance to a qgp equation of state with a later hadron cascade .",
    "he looked at the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow in order to detect qgp production . summarizing this part",
    ", we would conclude that the effect of qgp should be seen in the anisotropic flow dependence on the energy of the colliding nuclei , or in the dependence on the centrality of the collision .",
    "if the situation would be such that a qgp is produced only in a small fraction of the collisions than fluctuations in flow would be one of the best observables for this effect .",
    "the formation of dcc in nuclear collisions could also result in an event anisotropy .",
    "it could be due to the anisotropic shape of the dcc domains  @xcite or just to local fluctuations in the charged multiplicity , which should result in `` orthogonal '' flow in charged and neutral sectors  @xcite .",
    "the very magnitude of anisotropic flow is sensitive to the degree of equilibration in the system .",
    "note that at present there is no calculation based on the hydro - dynamical picture which accounts for the experimentally observed values of the effect .",
    "this could have its origin in the obvious difficulties of hydrodynamic model calculations , but it could also indicate a non - applicability of the picture to nuclear collisions .",
    "the cascade models such as rqmd describe the data much better . from this point of view",
    "the analysis of elliptic flow in the collision - less and hydrodynamic limits performed in  @xcite is very interesting .",
    "the hbt interferometry performed relative to the event plane  @xcite becomes also extremely important at this point .",
    "does the system really expand in the reaction plane as prescribed by hydrodynamics ?",
    "simultaneous measurements of the anisotropic flow and the two - particle , identical as well as non identical  @xcite , correlations in principle should answer this question .",
    "we must also mention the importance of anisotropic flow measurements to the vast variety of other measurements , which from first look have nothing to do with anisotropic flow .",
    "let us consider high @xmath6 particle production .",
    "it could be that the production mechanism ( hard parton scattering ) is very insensitive to the in - plane expansion , but that the rescattering of high @xmath6 partons is different in the different directions of particle emission due to the anisotropic geometry of the collision zone .",
    "this would lead to anisotropy in high @xmath6 particle production and gives another opportunity to study how it develops  @xcite .",
    "another example is hbt measurements averaged over all orientations of particle emission .",
    "one would think that this does not require reaction plane measurements , but this is not really true .",
    "the mixed pair distribution usually used in the correlation function calculation can strongly depend on the relative orientation of the reaction plane of the events used to create the mixed pair .",
    "therefore one should have this information even in the case where the dependence of the hbt parameters on the reaction plane is not studied .",
    "the study of azimuthal anisotropy of unidentified charged hadrons needs the momenta of the particles but does not have any unusual requirements for calibrations , momentum resolution , acceptance , efficiency , two - track resolution , or two - track efficiency .",
    "however , for future analyses it would be good to have particle identification .",
    "the anisotropy in the azimuthal distribution of particles is often characterized by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and called directed and elliptic flow respectively .",
    "this anisotropy , especially @xmath2 , plays an important role in high energy nuclear collisions and is expected to be even more important at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of particles is described by a fourier expansion  @xcite @xmath9\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the true reaction plane angle .",
    "the reaction plane is defined by the beam direction and the impact parameter vector @xmath11 . in a given rapidity ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath6 interval",

    "of course , these equations only apply to simulations where one knows @xmath10 .    comparing the anisotropy coefficients in momentum space ( @xmath15 ) with the anisotropy coefficients in coordinate space ( @xmath16 ) as a function of @xmath6 helps us to understand the space - time evolution of nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite . to study this space - time evolution at rhic , @xmath17 au+au collisions at @xmath18  =  200",

    "this finds an explanation in a picture with strong ( positive ) space - momentum correlations , taking into account the correlation between nucleon stopping and the original position of the nucleons in the transverse plane  @xcite . for pions , the rapidity dependence of @xmath1",

    "particles acquire a large @xmath6 when they are produced by a hard collision ( which should not produce an event anisotropy ) or when they have a large number of soft collisions ( rescattering ) .",
    "the latter would explain the increase in @xmath2 and it explains why r@xmath22 goes from negative for nucleons integrated over all @xmath6 to positive for nucleons with large @xmath6 .",
    "collective flow and the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are usually associated with soft processes .",
    "however , the coefficients describe the event anisotropy and are not limited to only soft physics . at rhic energies",
    "hard processes become important .",
    "they happen early in the reaction and thus can be used to probe the early stage of the evolution of a dense system . during this time a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )",
    "could exist .",
    "associated with hard processes are jets . however",
    ", when the transverse energy of the jets becomes smaller it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve them from the `` soft '' particles .",
    "these jets with @xmath23 5 gev are usually refered to as mini - jets . at rhic energies",
    "it has been estimated that 50% of the transverse energy is produced by mini - jets  @xcite .",
    "medium induced radiative energy loss of high @xmath6 partons ( jet quenching ) could be very different in a hadronic medium and a partonic medium .",
    "recently it was shown that this energy loss per unit distance , @xmath24 , grows linearly with the total length of the medium  @xcite . for non central collisions the hot and dense overlap region has an almond shape .",
    "this implies different path lengths and therefore different energy loss for particles moving in the in - plane versus the out - plane direction . to study this anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite , @xmath25 au+au collisions at @xmath26  =  200",
