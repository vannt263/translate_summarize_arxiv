    "the casimir effect involves the difference between the energy of a field subject to some constraining boundaries and the energy of the field with such constraints removed .",
    "although casimir @xcite introduced this consideration long ago , in 1948 , the study of this effect enjoys currently considerable popularity @xcite .",
    "indeed this journal included very recenty an exposition on the effect @xcite .",
    "the experimental status of the effect was tenuous until 1997 with the report of vindication of the theoretical prediction to an accuracy of a few percent @xcite .",
    "the reason for this continuous interest is not hard to find : in this effect we have a direct demonstration of the existence of the so called `` vacuum fluctuations '' or `` zero point energy '' .",
    "thus the original effect was a prediction that two parallel conducting plates will experience mutual attraction in vacuum ( at zero temperature , @xmath0 ) , caused by modification of the allowed modes due to the presence of the plates .",
    "remarkably the attractive force is independent of the coupling of the electromagnetic ( em ) field to matter ( viz .",
    ", the electronic charge , e ) and is proportional to the velocity of light , c and planck s constant , h. today , of course , we understand that every quantized field exhibits fluctuations even at its lowest ( vacuum ) state and these fluctuations sample the allowed modes . furthermore , whereas the original effect related to modified boundary conditions , more recent works ( e.g. , schwinger as cited in @xcite ) led to studies of bulk ( volume ) casimir effect ( where we consider the forces on a sample because it is different from its environment , e.g. , through having a different dielectric constant ) and to the dynamical casimir effect where time is involved . + another direction for casimir effect studies is its extensions to finite temperatures . again the simplest case deals with modified modes of the em field due to the presence of conductors as boundaries but now each mode is thermally occupied in addition to it being sampled through vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this also leads to an effective force between the plates .",
    "finite temperature studies were carried out by several authors @xcite . yet , to our knowledge , the classical limit of the effect , even for the em field , has not been clarified todate .",
    "this paper addresses this problem .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section , section 2 , contains a review - hopefully self contained - of the casimir effect problem in its simplest form , viz . , radiation field confined between two conducting plates .",
    "this section includes the exact solution for the casimir energy , free energy and entropy @xcite .",
    "these are displayed in a figure which gives the behavior of these quantities for all temperatures .",
    "the succeeding section , section 3 , includes the central point of the paper , viz .",
    ", an exposition of the classical limit and a study of its implications .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the demonstration that the classical solution is `` robust '' - by this we mean that a naive high temperature expansion for the casimir energy does nt have any nonvanishing corrections to the classical value . in the conclusions which are given in section 5 we review the old ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) argument for the existence of zero point fluctuations as viewed from our vantage point .",
    "evaluation and definition of the casimir energy at zero temperature due to vacuum fluctuations for the case under study here is given in several texts and reviews ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our presentation therefore , although aspiring for self containment , is somewhat sketchy .",
    "we consider the radiation field confined between two conducting plates .",
    "the size of the plates edge is l. the first plate is placed at @xmath1 in the @xmath2 plane , and the second at @xmath3 parallel to the @xmath2 plane .",
    "( in fact we are interested in @xmath5 while @xmath6 remains finite . ) the energy , i.e. the expectation value of the hamiltonian , tied down in zero point fluctuations in the mode @xmath7 is , in obvious notation ( @xmath7 includes the polarization and the zero in the argument relates to @xmath0 ) , @xmath8    the total energy density of the em field with the conducting plates as boundaries is ( @xmath9 is the magnitude of the wave vector parallel to the plates @xcite ) @xmath10\\ ] ] @xmath11    the energy density , in dimensionless units , @xmath12 , is given by @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14.\\ ] ] the equation above defines d whose dimension is energy density . the energy density due to vacuum fluctuations of the radiation field in an arbitrarily large volume , @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) - which serves as the reference , unconstrained ,",

    "@xmath22 is commonly @xcite evaluated by a physically justifiable regularization technique .",
    "thus a wave vector dependent function , @xmath23 , is introduced into the above integrals such that for @xmath24 @xmath25 while @xmath26 for @xmath27 thereby rendering the integrals convergent .",
    "a simple choice is ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29.\\ ] ] @xmath30 is allowed to go to zero at the end of the calculations - for all the terms together - thus the sum is `` regularized '' .",
    "the details of the calculations will not be given here ( cf .",

    "is displayed in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , as it should .    at this juncture",
    "it is natural to consider casimir s entropy @xcite .",
    "this entropy , @xmath56 , in our dimensionless units is defined by @xmath57 @xmath58 is displayed in fig . 1 ( note the negative sign ) . at high temperatures , @xmath59",
    ", @xmath46 falls off exponentially with @xmath60 , @xmath56 approaches a constant value ( independent of t and , of course , of @xmath61 ) while @xmath53 becomes proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "reexpressing these results in standard physical dimensions we get , at this limit , @xmath59 , @xmath62 note that the entropy is proportional to the area of the plates scaled by @xmath63 ( d is the plates separation ) .",
    "we thus conclude that in the classical limit ( high temperatures ) the casimir force is purely entropic .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the vanishing of the casimir energy for @xmath64 ( cf . fig .",
    "1 ) may be gained via the following reasoning .",
    "loosely speaking @xcite the number of normal modes ( per unit volume ) in our confined system is unchanged upon changing @xmath6 ( in the case under study ) .",
    "( a proof of this , based on regularization , is given in the next section . ) thus moving the walls adiabatically leads to shifts in the levels - not to appearance ( or disappearance ) of levels ( modes ) .",
    "this ( coupled with the classically valid equipartitioning of energy , which means that each harmonic oscillator- like mode holds @xmath65 amount of energy ) implies that the energy density , in this classical limit , is unchanged upon changing @xmath6 .",
    "i.e. , in the classical limit , @xmath66 by the validity of the rayleigh jeans ( rj ) law or the equipartioning of the energy @xcite , the casimir energy is nil .",
    "this , since it is defined as the difference in the energy ( density ) between the constrained ( @xmath67 ) and the unconstrained ( @xmath68 ) cases and we have just argued that there exists ( intuitive ) one to one correspondence between the levels regardless of the size of @xmath6 .",
    "thus we have , in conformity with the result of the exact calculations as exhibited in fig .",
    "1 , that , @xmath69 in discussions of black body radiation , kirchhoff s law ( that the ratio of emissivity to absorptivity of all bodies is a universal function of the wavelengh , @xmath70 and the temperature , @xmath71 ) is used @xcite to infer that @xmath72 , the total electromagnetic ( @xmath73 ) energy in a cavity at thermal equilibrium is a function of @xmath71 only , @xmath74 with @xmath72 the thermodynamic internal energy . we see from our discussion above that this is true only for @xmath64 where @xmath75 is a characteristic temperature of the cavity ( cf . eq .",
    "( e.g. , at @xmath0 it is , strictly speaking , never true . ) for this reason we refer to eq .",
    "23 as `` kirchhoff s theorem '' .",
    "we remark that the rj result can be readily obtained within classical physics @xcite and hence our definition of classical limit as the one where the equipartition theorem holds is a reasonable one .",
    "+ the entropy , @xmath76 , as a function of the energy , @xmath77 , of a cavity ( i.e. , a constrained system ) , is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the number of states with energies less than or equal to e. in evaluating the casimir entropy in the classical limit ( which is the difference in the entropies , at high energies , of the entropies of the constrained and the `` free '' systems ) we expect the dominant contribution , the `` volume term '' @xcite , to cancel .",
    "this is because at these energies the dominant contribution is from the short wavelength modes ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "these are insensitive to the boundaries when the dimension of the cavity much exceeds these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the casimir entropy , then , is essentially determined by the long wavelengths which are geometry dependent , i.e. , which relate to the `` shape '' of the cavity and is independent of temperature .",
    "it follows then that the casimir _ free _ energy is proportional to the temperature .",
    "this reasoning is born out by the explicit calculational results .",
    "hence we see that this , viz .",
    ", the _ free _ energy being proportional to t , is not at all related to the rj law - the latter relates to the energy .",
    "+ we are now in a position to interpret the zero point energy ( zpe ) as a contribution necessary to assure that at high temperatures , the energy , @xmath72 , is a function of @xmath71 only as , indeed , was noted long ago ( 1913 ) by einstein and stern ( @xcite , p.2 ) : without it the energy will depend on the boundaries . alternatively ,",
    "if we assume the validity of `` kirchhoff s theorem '' at high temperatures , we may deduce the zero temperature casimir energy as follows .",
    "+ let the energy per mode , @xmath7 , of the radiation field be written as ( @xmath75 refers to the constraints , if present ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy held in the mode without the zpe . for an allowed mode , @xmath7 : @xmath83 the casimir energy is then , @xmath84 use of eq .",
    "25 ( i.e. , separating the thermal energy from the vacuum s ) and kirchhoff s theorem ( eq . 23 ) implies , @xmath85 } = 0.\\ ] ] with @xmath86 being the casimir energy at zero temperature .",
    "hence @xmath87 = -   \\varepsilon_c(0).\\ ] ] now both terms in the square bracket are readily calculable - their temperature dependence assures convergence - and thus yield the casimir energy at @xmath19 ( @xmath86 ) without recourse to a ( perhaps ) objectionable regularization scheme .",
    "in this section we evaluate the casimir energy through a power series expansion in @xmath60 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "this scheme requires regularization for each term in the expansion .",
    "the result is that , within such an expansion , kirchhoff s theorem is exact .",
    "i.e. the casimir energy vanishes to all orders in this high temperature expansion .",
    "this is interpreted as implying that the classical equipartition theorem is robust - the classical approximation , once taken , is exact to within power series corrections .",
    "we hasten to add that this is yet another example of incorrect handling of infinities which are further discussed at the end of this section .",
    "+ let us return to the expression for the casimir energy density at finite temperature , eqs .",
    "10 and 15 , which , in our dimensionless units are summarized by @xmath89 , @xmath90.\\ ] ] we now adjunct to each of the above integrals the `` standard '' @xcite cutoff function , @xmath91,\\ ] ] assuring thereby the convergence of the integrals .",
    "( we are interested in the @xmath92 limit . )",
    "we note that such regularization scheme is justifiable on physical grounds as follows @xcite .",
    "the conductivity is , in general , a function of frequency .",
    "indeed , all metallic conductors are effectively transparent to radiation with wave lengths comparable to the interatomic spacing , @xmath93 .",
    "hence the integrals ( and summations ) over wavenumbers , @xmath7 , are limited to @xmath94 , i.e. , for wavenumbers @xmath95 the plates do not provide a boundary and hence the casimir energy for @xmath96 evidently vanishes .",
    "+ assuming the validity of the `` standard '' regularization scheme ( each integrand is multiplied by a cutoff function assuring the convergence of the integrals ) we may expand @xcite , p.35 , @xmath97 the evaluation of @xmath46 reduces to the evaluation of terms like @xcite @xmath98 the cutoff parameter , @xmath30 , is set equal to zero at the end of the calculations ; the result is @xmath99 .\\ ] ] noting that @xcite , p.1076 , @xmath100 we get @xmath101 for @xmath102 even , and for p odd , @xmath103 returning to our expression , eq .",

    "31 only terms with @xmath102 even occur , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "this confirms the exponential decay of the casimir energy with temperature that is implied by eq .",
    "15 , and depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "( the case of @xmath105 will be recognized as the sum over the constrained number of modes , per unit volume , with the unconstrained number deducted therefrom . that the result is nil constitues a proof , based on a particular regularization scheme , of our assersion ( section 3 ) that the number of modes , per unit volume , is unchanged upon varying the plates separation , d. ) + this `` robustness '' of the classical ( erroneous ) solution is worthy of note and it implies that the correct expression ca nt be obtained from the wrong one by analytic ( power series ) means .",
    "this paper gives the classical - here the high temperature - limit of the casimir effect .",
    "the case studied was the simplest and historically the first considered - viz . the radiation field confined between two large ( in the limit - infinite ) parallel conducting plates separated by a relatively short distance , d. we argued that in the classical limit ( defined to be temperatures such that the rayleigh jeans , i.e. energy equipartition , theorem holds ) `` kirchhoff s theorem '' is valid - i.e. the energy density of the radiation field is a function of the temperature only and this implies that , in this limit , the casimir energy vanishes .",
    "we showed that the zero point energy is required to assure the validity of `` kirchhoff s theorem '' in the classical limit . alternatively , assuming the validity of the theorem allows the evaluation of the casimir energy at @xmath0 without recourse to any regularization scheme .",
    "we noted , following reference @xcite , that these results were anticipated by einstein and stern in 1913 , prior to the formulation of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",
    "thus these authors noted that the high temperature expansion of what we now term bose distribution function is ( @xmath106 ) @xmath107 thus we have here a temperature independent term which contributes to the total energy .",
    "its cancellation , i.e. , the validity of `` kirchhoff s theorem '' in our presentation , requires a positive zero point energy , @xmath108 . thus the removal of the zero point energy by considering a `` normally '' ordered hamiltonian does not eliminate the need for zero point energy .",
    "it ( the zero point energy ) is seen , ala the einstein and stern result as discussed above , to be required for the correct classical limit or , in our terminology , for the validity of `` kirchhoff s theorem '' .",
    "this stems here from the form of the bose distribution rather than the hamiltonian .",
    "+ the evaluation of the ( casimir ) free energy in the classical limit led to showing that the casimir entropy , which is defined in a natural way in the text , is ( in this limit ) temperature independent constant and reflects finite volume corrections in statistical physics . thereby the proportionality of the free energy to the temperature , @xmath71 that is well known @xcite is seen not to be related to the rayleigh jeans limit @xcite but rather is a consequence of the perhaps interesting result that the casimir force in the classical limit is purely entropic - in fact geometric .",
    "we have demonstrated that the classical limit results , i.e. , at temperatures high enough to warrant the applicability of the rayleigh jean s law are `` robust '' in the sense that ( naively ) it leads to vanishing corrections .",
