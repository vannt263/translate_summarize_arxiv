    ". then near - infrared surveys , such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) began uncovering massive open clusters deep in the galaxy .",
    "numerous new clusters have been found starting with several 2mass - based targeted near - infrared surveys ( dutra & bica 2000 , 2001 , froebrich et al  2007 ) , glimpse ( mercer et al .",

    "the reasons to study large populations of young clusters are numerous .",
    "first , such clusters help us to better reveal galactic structure ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "they constrain the history of the chemical evolution throughout the milky way .",
    "they also provide critical benchmarks to test stellar evolution .",
    "for example , having many clusters imply sampling different environments , an essential tool for testing theoretical models .",
    "massive clusters are especially important in this context , as they allow us to beat the small - number statistics that plague typical intermediate - mass cluster studies . with a massive stellar cluster they may display several red supergiants , or several very massive core h - burning stars simultaneously . finally , the most massive clusters in our galaxy , and where there is access to study the individual stars , are close analogs to distant starbursts for which only integrated properties are known .",
    "a more in depth knowledge of nearby massive stellar clusters will enhance our understanding of extragalactic stellar clusters .    to improve further our knowledge of distant and obscured clusters ,",
    "this field will benefit from the forthcoming advent of several new facilities : gaia , jwst , alma , ska . besides the detection of new objects",
    ", they will provide a better characterization of the identified cases .",
    "notably , an improvement of the distance determinations is awaited , not only for calibration purposes , but also to understand the galactic structure .",
    "discrepancies have been noted between trigonometric , kinematic and spectrophotometric estimates ( moiss et al .",
    "kinematic values may be wrong if the cluster s velocity is not only fixed by the global kinematic field of the milky way ( _ e.g. _ if the cluster formation results from the collision of two moving clouds ) .",
    "young and massive clusters of stars are rare , distant and often obscured by surrounding gas and dust .",
    "however , their energy and momentum input into the ism via e.g. stellar winds , ionizing radiation or sn explosions is extensive .",
    "a first step to understand the details of the evolution and feedback from massive stars is to find and characterize their birth clusters .    .",
    "small open red circles mark hii tracers , small green small filled circles mark cepheid distances .",

    ", width=384 ]    infrared - based searches for obscured and distant massive clusters in the milky way has progressed greatly since the first 2mass cluster searches .",
    "higher spatial resolution , deeper photometry , and numerous new algorithms have been obtained and applied to discover ever more candidate stellar clusters . with so many searches underway ,",
    "will the numbers ever reach the 30,000 stellar clusters in the milky way as predicted by portegies zwart et al .",
    "currently , the cluster mass function in the milky way is underrepresented in young massive clusters older than a few tens of millions of years and less than 100 million years .",
    "this has driven a boom of stellar cluster searches in the milky way using recent , current and future surveys such as 2mass , spitzer , wise , vista .",
    "they provide outstanding , homogenous large - scale data sets and are ideally suited for such searches .",

    "2003 ) . locating any kind of stellar remnant or",
    "highly massive star provides a high likelihood of locating a massive young cluster nearby .    despite the abundance search methods , targeted , simple visual ( by eye ) searches , sophisticated algorithms searching for increased stellar densities or photometric color ranges",
    ", no method can be sure to catch all clusters of a certain distance or luminosity ( or mass ) limit and each has its own biases .",
    "variations , predominantly in extinction , but also the complexity of the background star field , the concentration level of the stellar cluster , and the age and mass of the cluster will strongly influence the detectability of real clusters ( hanson et al .",
    "this makes the derivation of such values as the cluster luminosity function and the cluster destruction timescales nearly impossible to obtain confidently for the milky way .",
    "a number of cluster databases now exist on the web ( webda , dias , kharchenko , sai catalog , fsr listing , etc . ) , yet they represent just 10% of what is expected to exist in the milky way .",
    "moreover , false positives are expected to be rather high with the deepest searches .",
    "many of the same methods used for obtaining age , distance and extinction of optical clusters are applied in the infrared for these clusters with some success : color - magnitude diagrams , spectral classification , etc ( _ e.g. _ borissova et al .",
    "2011 , chen et al .",
    "however , characterization of infrared clusters is more challenging than in the optical due to the weaker dependence of infrared colors with temperature variation and the strong contamination by red - giant field stars . for clusters in the age range of a few to tens of millions of years",
    ", their most massive stars may exist as exceedingly bright , red supergiants .",
    "their blaring luminosity impedes study of the rest of the cluster ( including identification of the cluster in the first place ) .",
    "radial velocities combined with galactic rotation curves can provide some independent values for distance ( though see moiss et al .",
    "maser parallaxes are most promising . in massive young clusters , there are sure to be red supergiants and these can provide strong radio masers , useful for parallax and proper motion studies to derive distance and cluster membership ( zhang et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "cluster mass is always a difficult characteristic to determine as it is strongly dependent on assumptions of the initial mass function , lower mass cutoff and binary fraction .",
    "virial masses can sometimes provide better insight , but not many infrared clusters have been studied in this way , due to the lack of high resolution spectra of constituent stars .",
    "virial mass has been used as a mass measure with integrated spectra of extragalactic clusters ( mengel et al .",
    "promising future surveys include exploring the time domain ( _ e.g. _ vvv and lsst ) for variability and proper motions , as well as narrow band surveys to locate variable ( lbvs ) or emission - line stars ( wrs ) expected to be associated with massive stellar clusters .",
    "the center of the galaxy is a unique environment to study massive stars . on a scale of about 100 parsecs ,",
    "three young massive clusters are encountered : the arches , the quintuplet and the central cluster .",
    "in addition to the massive clusters , a number of `` isolated '' massive stars are also found . in total ,",
    "about 90 wolf ",
    "rayet stars and more than 250 ob stars have been identified in the last 20 years .",
    "the galactic center is hidden behind 25 to 30 magnitudes of visual extinction , rendering optical observations unfeasible .",
    "hence , it is perfectly suited for infrared studies .",
    "in addition , its distance is well constrained : 8@xmath20.5 kpc ( gillessen et al .",

    "( 2009 ) points to a value almost consistent with the salpeter slope ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "what is clear from all studies is that the cluster is mass segregated : the most massive stars are located in the central region .",
    "this segregation could be due to dynamical interactions ( kim et al .",

    "the cluster evolution during this phase is governed by a complex mixture of gas dynamics , stellar dynamics , stellar evolution , and radiative transfer , and is not completely understood ( elmegreen 2007 , price & bate 2009 ) .",
    "thus many basic ( and critical ) cluster properties , such as the duration and efficiency of the star - formation process , the cluster survival probability and the stellar mass function at the beginning of the next phase are uncertain .",

    ", two new clusters have been found in the milky way .",
    "the first , masgomas-1 ( ramrez - alegra et al .",
    "2012 ) , was identified as candidate by the presence of a concentration of candidate ob - stars in the photometric diagrams and was confirmed by the presence of 17 stars classified as o9-b1v , 3 m supergiants and one a supergiant among the 28 stars observed spectroscopically in the follow - up programme ( of course , this is a minimum for the cluster population ) .",
    "based on this spectroscopically confirmed population , a distance to masgomas-1 was found of 3.53+/-1.48 kpc , with a mass of @xmath33m@xmath0 ( using the imf from kroupa 2001 ) and an age between 6.5 and 10 myr , based on the simultaneous presence of red supergiants and o9v stars .",
    "the second cluster , masgomas-4 , has two cores surrounded by strong nebulosity at 5.8  @xmath34 m .",
    "one of the cores is the hii region sh2 - 76 e , known as an active massive star forming region ( wu et al .",
    "it is unclear whether the two cores are physically related .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the stellar population of both cores has found that they are at the same distance from the sun and have the same average extinction .",
    "this indicates that both cores are physically related , and that the whole cluster , at a distance of 1.9 kpc , has a mass of @xmath35m@xmath0 , and an age @xmath32 3 myr , based on the presence of the hii region .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between both cores : core b displays in its color - color diagram a population of young , possible pre - main sequence objects , while this population is absent in core a. the reason for this difference is not yet known .",
