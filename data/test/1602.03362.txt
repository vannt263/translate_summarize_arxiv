    "majorana neutrino masses , lepton number violation and neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) are intimately related .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that many models contributing to @xmath1 have been discussed in the literature , see for example the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "however , the famous black - box theorem @xcite guarantees only that - if @xmath1 decay is observed - majorana neutrino masses must appear at the 4-loop level , which is much too small @xcite to explain current oscillation data @xcite .",
    "thus , a priori one does not know whether some `` exotic '' contribution or the mass mechanism dominates the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "distinguishing the different contributions would not only be an important step towards determining the origin of neutrino masses , but would also have profound implications for leptogenesis @xcite .    in terms of only standard model ( sm ) fields ,",
    "@xmath2 terms can be written as non - renormalizable operators ( nros ) of odd mass dimensions . at mass dimension",
    "@xmath3 , there is only one such operator , the famous weinberg operator @xcite , @xmath4 . at tree - level",
    "the weinberg operator can be understood as the low - energy limit of one of the three possible seesaw realizations @xcite .",
    "all other @xmath2 operators up to @xmath5  excluding , however , possible operators containing derivatives  have been listed in @xcite . when complemented with sm yukawa interactions ( and in some cases",
    "sm charged current interactions ) , these higher dimensional operators always also generate majorana neutrino masses ( at different loop - levels ) , leading again to the weinberg operator , @xmath6 . for neutrino mass models based on this type of effective operators ,",
    "see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "] at low energies .",
    "all @xmath2 operators also contribute to @xmath1 decay . from the nuclear point of view , the amplitude for @xmath1 decay contains two parts : the long - range part and the short - range part .",
    "the so - called long - range part @xcite describes all contributions involving the exchange of a light , virtual neutrino between two nucleons .",
    "this category contains the mass mechanism , i.e. the weinberg operator sandwiched between two sm charged current interactions , and also contributions due to @xmath0 lepton number violating operators .",
    "operators and call the standard contribution from majorana neutrino mass separately the `` mass mechanism '' . ] the short - range part of the @xmath1 decay amplitude @xcite , on the other hand , contains all contributions from the exchange of heavy particles and can be described by a certain subset of the @xmath7 @xmath2 operators in the list of @xcite . in total",
    "there are six @xmath7 operators contributing to the short - range part of the amplitude at tree - level and the complete decomposition for the ( scalar induced ) operators has been given in @xcite .",
    "the relation of all these decompositions with neutrino mass models has been studied recently in @xcite .",
    "effective operators were discussed in @xcite the decomposition of the @xmath2 operators was also discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "the general conclusion of @xcite is that for 2-loop and 3-loop neutrino mass models , the short - range part of the amplitude could be as important as the mass mechanism , while for tree - level and 1-loop models one expects that the mass mechanism gives the dominant contribution to @xmath1 decay .",
    "decay have been discussed in @xcite . ]    in this paper we study @xmath0 @xmath2 operators , their relation to neutrino masses and the long - range part of the @xmath1 decay amplitude .",
    "we decompose all @xmath0 @xmath2 operators and determine the level of perturbation theory , at which the different decompositions ( or `` proto - models '' ) will generate neutrino masses .",
    "tree - level , 1-loop and 2-loop neutrino mass models are found in the list of the decompositions .",
    "we then compare the contribution from the mass mechanism to the @xmath1 decay amplitude with the long - range @xmath0 contribution . depending on which particular _ nuclear _",
    "operator is generated , limits on the new physics scale @xmath8 tev can be derived from the @xmath0 contribution . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the mean of the couplings entering the ( decomposed ) @xmath0 operator .",
    "this should be compared to limits of the order of roughly @xmath10 @xmath11 tev and @xmath12 @xmath13 tev , derived from the upper limit on @xmath14 for tree - level and 2-loop ( @xmath0 ) neutrino masses .",
    "( here , @xmath15 is again some mean of couplings entering the neutrino mass diagram .",
    "we use a different symbol , to remind that @xmath16 is not necessarily the same combination of couplings as @xmath9 . )",
    "thus , only for a certain , well - defined subset of models can the contribution from the long - range amplitude be expected to be similar to or dominate over the mass mechanism .",
    "note that , conversely a sub - dominant contribution to the long - range amplitude always exists also in all models with mass mechanism dominance .",
    "we then give the complete classification of all models contributing to the @xmath0 operators in tabular form in the appendix of this paper .",
    "in this list all models giving long - range contributions to @xmath1 decay can be found , such as , for example , supersymmetric models with r - parity violation @xcite or scalar leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "there are also models with non - sm vectors , which could fit into models with extended gauge sectors , such as the left - right symmetric model @xcite . and , finally , there are new models in this list , not considered in the literature previously .",
    "we mention that our paper has some overlap with the recent work  @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper also studied @xmath0 @xmath2 operators .",
    "operators were also discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "they discuss 1-loop neutrino masses induced by these operators , lepton flavour violating decays and , in particular , lhc phenomenology for one example operator in detail .",
    "the main differences between our work and theirs is that we ( a ) focus here on the relation of these operators with the long - range amplitude of @xmath1 decay , which was not studied in @xcite and ( b ) also discuss tree - level and 2-loop neutrino mass models .",
    "in particular , we find that 2-loop neutrino mass models are particularly interesting , because the @xmath0 long - range contribution dominates @xmath1 only in the class of models .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we lay the basis for the discussion , establishing the notation and recalling the main definitions for @xmath2 operators and @xmath1 decay amplitude . in the following section",
    "we then discuss an example of each : tree - level , 1-loop and 2-loop neutrino mass models . in each case",
    "we estimate the contribution to the mass mechanism and the constraints from the long - range amplitude .",
    "we study a 2-loop @xmath0 model in some more detail , comparing also to oscillation data and discuss the constraint from lepton flavour violating processes . in section [",
    "sect : lim ] we then discuss a special case , where a @xmath7 operator can give an equally important contribution to the @xmath1 decay amplitude as a @xmath0 operator .",
    "the example we discuss is related to the left - right symmetric extension of the standard model and , thus , of particular interest .",
    "we then close the paper with a short summary .",
    "the complete list of decompositions for @xmath0 operators is given as an appendix .",
    "the @xmath1 decay amplitude can be separated into two pieces : ( a ) the long - range part @xcite , including the well - known mass mechanism , and ( b ) the short - range part @xcite of the decay rate describing heavy particle exchange . here",
    ", we will concentrate exclusively on the long - range part of the amplitude .",
    "the long - range part of the amplitude exchanges a light , virtual neutrino between two point - like vertices .",
    "the numerator of the neutrino propagator involves two pieces , @xmath17 .",
    "if the interaction vertices contain standard model charged current interactions , the @xmath18-term is projected out .",
    "this yields the `` mass mechanism '' of @xmath1 decay .",
    "if one of the two vertices involved in the diagram produces a neutrino in the wrong helicity state , i.e. @xmath19 , the @xmath20-term is picked from the propagator .",
    "since the momentum of the virtual neutrino is typically of the order of the fermi momentum of the nucleons , @xmath21 mev , the @xmath1 amplitude from the operators proportional to @xmath20 is enhanced by @xmath22 with respect to the amplitude of the standard mass mechanism .",
    "consequently , any operator proportional to @xmath20 will be tightly constrained from non - observation of double beta decay .",
    "following @xcite we write the effective lagrangian for 4-fermion interactions as @xmath23\\,.\\label{eq : deflr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the leptonic ( hadronic ) currents @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the first term of eq .   is the sm charged current interaction , the other terms contain all new physics contributions .",
    "we normalize the coefficients @xmath29 relative to the sm charged current strength @xmath30 .",
    "recall , @xmath31 and we will use the subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 for left - handed and right - handed fermions , respectively . note also that all leptonic currents with @xmath34 will pick @xmath18 from the propagator , leading to an amplitude proportional to @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , which is always smaller than the standard mass mechanism contribution and thus is not very interesting .",
    "thus , only six particular @xmath37 can be constrained from @xmath1 decay . for convenience , we repeat the currently best limits , all derived in @xcite , in table [ tab : limitslong ]",
    ".    .limits on @xmath38 from non - observation of @xmath39xe @xmath1 decay , where @xmath40 .",
    "these limits were derived in @xcite and have been updated with the combined limit from kamland - zen and exo-200 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is another category of lepton - number - violating effective operators , not contained in the catalogue by babu and leung : operators with covariant derivatives @xmath41 .",
    "these have been intensively studied in refs .",
    "the derivative operators with mass dimension seven are classified into two types by their ingredient fields ; one is @xmath42 and the other is @xmath43 . with the full decomposition ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the tree - level decompositions of the first type must contain one of the seesaw mediators . therefore , the neutrino masses are generated at the tree level and the mass mechanism always dominate the contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "the decompositions of the second type also require the scalar triplet of the type ii seesaw mechanism when we do not employ vector fields as mediators , and the new physics contributions to @xmath1 become insignificant again compared to the mass mechanism . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors successfully obtained the derivative operator @xmath44 at the tree level and simultaneously avoided the tree - level neutrino mass with the help of a second higgs doublet @xmath45 and a @xmath46 parity which is broken spontaneously .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to use the ingredients obtained from decompositions and do not discuss such extensions . within our framework ,",
    "the derivative operators are always associated with tree - level neutrino masses . in this study , we have mainly focused on the cases where the new physics contributions give a considerable impact on the @xmath1 processes .",
    "therefore , we do not go into the details of the decompositions of the derivative operators .",
