    "if true , the conjecture would imply the finitness of the maximal number @xmath7 of the limit cycles , which a plane polynomial vector field of degree @xmath8 can have .",
    "therefore it plays a fundamental role in all questions related to the second part of the 16th hilbert problem and its ramifications .",

    "several special cases of this result were earlier proved , under different genericity assumptionss either on @xmath0 or on the family @xmath1 , by cherkas , mourtada , el morsalani , dumortier , roussarie , rousseau , jebrane , oadek , li , caubergh , luca and others @xcite , see also @xcite for survey of the results and references up to 1996 .",
    "the finite cyclicity of a k - saddle cycle ( any k ) , under finite - parameter analytic deformation was recently announced by mourtada @xcite .    for _ generic families _ of vector fields",

    "this approach was initiated by the author in @xcite , where we studied cyclicity of hamiltonian two - loops .",
    "as it is well known , the limit cycles of planar systems close to hamiltonian are closely related to the zeros of associated abelian integrals depending on a parameter ( the so called weakened 16th hilbert problem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* arnold , p.313 ) ) .",
    "zeros of complete elliptic integrals were successfully studied by topological arguments in a complex domain ( the argument principle ) after the pioneering work by g. s. petrov @xcite , see also oadek @xcite for a description of the method .",
    "it has been used in a more general context in several papers , e.g. @xcite , and in @xcite the idea has been used to replace abelian integrals by the true poincar return map .    in the present paper",

    "the main technical tool is lemma [ mainlemma ] in which we show that the connected components of the zero locus of the imaginary part of a dulac map are smooth semianalytic curves .",
    "this allows to estimate the variation of the argument of the displacement map along the border of an appropriate complex domain , and finally to apply the argument principle in order to evaluate its zeros in the domain .",
    "note that previously the relation between the monodromy and the dulac map was used by roussarie to compute the bautin ideal associated to the dulac map @xcite .",
    "this combined with @xcite also implies the finite cyclicity of one - saddle cycles .",

    "we give a new self - contained proof of roussarie s theorem about the finite cyclicity of one - saddle cycles .",
    "the origin of our method is then explained in section [ petrovtrick ] where we give a brief account of a local version of the so called `` petrov trick '' .",
