    "the existence of massive neutrinos , the unknown origin of parity violation in the standard model ( sm ) and the hierarchy problem are some of the important motivations for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the most natural extension of the standard model that addresses these issues is the supersymmetric version of the left - right symmetric extension of the standard model , which will treat the left - handed and right - handed particles on equal footing , and the parity violation we observe at low energies would be due to the spontaneous breaking of the left - right symmetry at some high scale @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of the left - right symmetric model is that the difference between the baryon number ( b ) and the lepton number ( l ) becomes a gauge symmetry , which leads to several interesting consequences .    in spite of the several virtues of the minimal supersymmetric left - right symmetric models ( mslrm ) ,",
    "we are yet to arrive at a fully consistent model , from which we can descend down to the mssm . one of the most important problems is the spontaneous breaking of left - right symmetry @xcite . there has been suggestions to solve this problem by introducing additional fields or higher dimensional operators or by going through a different symmetry breaking chain or breaking the left - right symmetry around the supersymmetry breaking scale @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "this problem is cured through the introduction of a parity - odd singlet , but the soft susy breaking terms then lead to breaking of electromagnetic charge invariance .",
    "one interesting susylr model is the minimal susylr model , which has been studied extensively @xcite , and it has been found that global minimum of the higgs potential is either charge violating or @xmath2-parity violating .",
    "recently we proposed yet another solution to the problem , which resembles the non - supersymmetric solution , relating the vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the left - handed and right - handed triplet higgs scalars to the higgs bi - doublet vev through a seesaw relation .",
    "we achieved this by introducing a bi - triplet and singlet higgs scalars , and the vacuum that preserves both electric charge and r - parity can naturally be the global minimum of the full potential . in this article we are applying this idea of spontaneous left - right symmetry breaking at high scale in supersymmetric models with only doublet higgs scalars .",
    "we extend the model with one singlet higgs scalar , which breaks the left - right parity of the gauge groups at a high scale .",
    "the most attractive feature of the present model is that it does not allow any left - right symmetric solution to be a minimum of the potential .",
    "we also discuss the question of neutrino masses via type iii see - saw mechanism and leptogenesis in details .",
    "we then embed the model in a grand unified theory and study the gauge coupling unification to check the consistency of the mass scales required in this model .",
    "in this section , we shall review the left - right extension of the standard model , where the gauge group at higher energies is the left - right symmetric group @xmath3 and we assume that at energies above the tev scale , the theory is supersymmetric . in these supersymmetric left - right symmetric models , it is assumed that the mssm gauge group @xmath4 is enhanced at some higher energy , above which the left - handed and right - handed fermions are treated on equal footing .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric left - right ( susylr ) model starts with the left - right symmetric gauge group @xmath5 , which could emerge from a supersymmetric @xmath6 grand unified theory .",
    "the field content of this model is given by , @xmath7 where the numbers in the brackets denote the quantum numbers under @xmath5 .",
    "the higgs sector of this model consists of the bidoublet and triplet superfields , given by , @xmath8 under the left - right parity corresponding to the interchange of the gauge groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or the d - parity , the fields transform as @xmath11 the superpotential for this theory is given by @xmath12 one of the important problems with the supersymmetric left - right extension of the standard model is that the minimization of the potential does not allow spontaneous parity breaking , which was considered to be one of the major triumph of the non - supersymmetric lr models .",
    "several attempts were made to solve this problem in some variants of the model .",
    "some of these solutions involve modifying the higgs sector , adding higher dimensional operators or involving a different breaking scheme of the group theory @xcite .",
    "the simplest solution is to include a bi - triplet field @xcite and allow d - parity breaking at some high scale , which may then allow parity violation spontaneously , allowing the scale of @xmath10 breaking to be different from the @xmath9 breaking scale .",
    "we extend that argument to the models involving only doublets .    in models with only doublet scalars ,",
    "we require three singlet fermions to give masses to the neutrinos .",
    "the charged fermion masses originate from the vev of the bi - doublet scalar field .",
    "since there are no triplet scalar field that breaks the symmetry @xmath10 , and all the triplet scalars are replaced by the doublet scalars , the bi - doublet field required to give masses to the charged fermions can give rise to the coupling required to break the parity , when d - parity is broken .",
    "thus left - right symmetry breaking becomes more natural in these models with only doublet scalar fields .",
    "this model is also able to generate baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis and provide neutrino masses through both inverse see - saw mechanism and also using type - iii see - saw mechanism .",
    "we consider here a susylr model with only doublet higgs scalars , which is the simplest extension of the non - supersymmetric lr model .",
    "this includes the bi - doublet scalar field that is required to give masses to the charged fermions and also to break the @xmath9 symmetry after the left - right symmetry is broken .",
    "the doubling of the bidoublet higgs in previous models was to ensure a non - vanishing ckm matrix .",
    "for the sake of simplicity of our model we forgo this condition since it does nt have any bearing on parity breaking .",
    "however , extension of the present model via doubling of the bidoublet is fairly trivial .",
    "thus , the higgs sector of our model is given by , @xmath13 where , with usual custom the subscript @xmath14 and @xmath2 denotes the left and right handedness of the higgs particle .",
    "the higgs particles with  bar \" in the notation , helps in anomaly cancellation of the model .    we have also included a singlet scalar field @xmath15 , which has the special property that it is even under the usual parity of the lorentz group , but it is odd under the parity that relates the gauge groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this field @xmath15 is thus a scalar and not a pseudo - scalar field , but under the d - parity transformation that interchanges @xmath9 with @xmath10 , it is odd .",
    "this kind of work is proposed in @xcite .",
    "although all the scalar fields are even under the parity of the lorentz group , under the d - parity the higgs sector transforms as , @xmath16 the superpotential of the model relevant in the context of parity breaking is given by , @xmath17 supersymmetry being unbroken , implies the @xmath18 and @xmath19 conditions are equal to zero .",
    "the @xmath18 flatness conditions for the various higgs fields are given by , @xmath20 similarly , the @xmath19 flatness conditions , are given by , @xmath21 in both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 flat conditions we have neglected the lepton fields , since they would have a zero vev .",
    "the vev s for the scalar fields are given by , @xmath22 here , for simplicity of the model , we have assumed @xmath23 and @xmath24 to have the same vev @xmath25 . similarly , for the right - handed fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "minimization of @xmath19 flat conditions , leads to a number of holomorphic gauge invariants which corresponds to flat directions @xcite . here , however , in order to determine the vacuum structure of our model , we minimize the @xmath18 flat conditions and discuss about the relations that emerge from them .",
    "after the scalar fields have acquired their respective vevs , the @xmath18 flatness conditions are given by , @xmath28 solving the equations we get four relations among the vevs .",
    "the role of d - parity odd singlets @xmath15 is uni - important in left - right breaking .",
    "this can be understood from eqns .",
    "( [ eq : chil_vev ] ) and ( [ eq : chir_vev ] ) as follows : @xmath30 if there is no @xmath15 field , then @xmath31 .",
    "this implies @xmath32 which is a left - right symmetric solution .",
    "also the f - term conditions ( [ eq : fchilvev])-([eq : fchirbvev ] ) are not consistent without the inclusion of the parity odd singlet @xmath15 in the model .",
    "hence , the parity odd singlet @xmath15 is necessary to account for the spontaneous left - right breaking and for the consistency of the model .",
    "we now try to interpret these results to get a working phenomenology . considering the last of the relations eqn ( [ eq : sigma_vev ] ) we see that @xmath33 is a trivial solution , and will put @xmath25 and @xmath34 on equal footing thus leading to unbroken parity .",
    "however , @xmath33 is a special solution of eqn ( [ eq : sigma_vev ] ) . for @xmath35 ,",
    "we have @xmath36 and parity is violated spontaneously .",
    "we will choose @xmath37 , as it is usually assumed in model building for phenomenological reasons .",
    "choosing the mass ( @xmath38 ) and vev ( @xmath39 ) of @xmath40 to be of electroweak ( ew ) scale and considering the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath41 to be of order unity , we immediately come to the conclusion , from eqn ( [ eq : chir_vev ] ) , that @xmath42 .    in order to avoid generic susy problems like over abundance of gravitino , we assume the mass scale of @xmath34 to be @xmath43 gev .",
    "this together with eqn ( [ eq : phi_vev ] ) gives the value of @xmath44 gev , where @xmath45 , another dimensionless quantity , without any fine - tuning is considered to be of order unity .",
    "this is also consistent with the assumption that @xmath37 . now using eqn ( [ eq : chil_vev ] ) and the above derived relation that @xmath42 we get @xmath46 gev .",
    "finally , from eqn ( [ eq : sigma_vev ] ) one derives the mass of @xmath15 ( @xmath47 ) to be of ew scale .",
    ".mass scales of the model [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the couplings evolve according to their respective beta functions .",
    "the renormalization group equations(rges ) for this model cane be written as @xmath48\\ ] ] where , @xmath49 .",
    "the indices @xmath50 refer to the gauge group @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively . unlike the d - parity breaking case where the intermediate left - right gauge group has four different coupling constants as discussed in @xcite , in the present case @xmath54 has only three gauge couplings , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "we now write down the rg evolution equation of gauge couplings upto one loop order which are given below @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the gut fine - structure constant and the beta function coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 are determined by the particle spectrum in the ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , and from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , respectively .    here",
    "we are using pdg values , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "consider the case where @xmath68 breaks down to @xmath69 . in that case",
    "@xmath70 the normalized generators are @xmath71 and @xmath72 . using these , one can write @xmath73 which implies that the matching of the coupling constant at the scale where the left - right symmetry begins to manifest itself is given by @xmath74      1 .   at scale",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 2 .   at scale",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath78        this will change once we add contributions coming from extra particle added to the minimal supersymmetric model .",
    "once we fix the values of beta functions , we can achieve lower values of @xmath79 .",
    "there are discussion @xcite , where the unification is possible at the same energy scale around @xmath80 gev , but the scale of @xmath79 varies from @xmath81 - @xmath82 gev .",
    "let us summarize our results .",
    "we point out that the non - supersymmetric version of the standard model is ruled out by lep data .",
    "however , the supersymmetric extension of this scenario remains a viable alternative to conventional grand unified theories and is capable of predicting the precision values of couplings determined from lep and unification is possible within the error bar .",
    "there are model @xcite where one can achieve unification of all three fundamental interactions in which d - parity is broken at the gut level .",
    "we see from figure ( [ fig : susylr ] ) that the gauge couplings unify at a scale @xmath83 gev .",
    "also the right handed scale @xmath64 is found to be @xmath84 gev in our model .",
    "we studied the question of spontaneous parity breaking in the supersymmetric version of the left - right symmetric models , in which all symmetry breaking takes place with only doublet higgs scalars .",
    "we demonstrate that unlike the models with triplet higgs scalars , in these models the left - right symmetry could be broken at a different scale compared to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , if we introduce a singlet higgs scalar @xmath15 , which breaks d - parity , that is the parity relating the gauge groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 but not relating to the parity of the lorentz group .",
    "the vev of the field @xmath15 breaks the d - parity , but does not break the lorentz parity .",
    "but when combined with the vevs of the other doublet scalars , it allows to break the group @xmath10 at a different scale than the @xmath9 breaking scale , which is in the range of @xmath85 gev , ( though we can have low @xmath34 which is allowed from minimization of the potential ) .",
    "we then demonstrated the consistency of the model in terms of the neutrino mass and the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we then consider embedding of the model and check the consistency of the mass scales involved for the gauge coupling unification .",
    "sudhanwa patra would like to thank santosh kumar singh for useful discussion . as would like to thank the hospitality of prl where most of this work was developed ."
