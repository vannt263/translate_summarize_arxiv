    "an applied magnetic field can penetrate into a type - ii superconductor in the form of quantized vortices ( each carry a single flux quantum @xmath1 ) when the applied magnetic field increases to a value above the lower critical field of the superconductor.@xcite the vortices first penetrate into the superconductor from the surfaces which are parallel to the applied magnetic field , and then go to the center of the superconductor.@xcite vortex motion is usually retarded @xcite during the penetration process because the vortices are subjected to surface attractive force @xcite , pinning forces , internal field repulsive force and damping force @xcite . the internal magnetic field ( or penetrated magnetic field )",
    "increases gradually and finally reaches a saturated value .",
    "de gennes @xcite first studied the vortex penetration in terms of free energy .",
    "a number of works studied the vortex entry conditions @xcite , and other works investigated the vortex penetration into the bulk of superconductors over the bean - livingston surface barrier @xcite .",
    "the experimental studies of the vortex penetration were generally carried out with hall sensors @xcite and magneto - optical imaging technique @xcite which provides direct observations of vortex front .",
    "it is known that vortex entry conditions and vortex penetration over surface barrier were studied .",
    "however , the bean - livingston surface barrier reduces exponentially with respect to the distance to the surface of the superconductor.@xcite the vortex motion inside a macro size superconductor is then mainly determined by the bulk pinning and internal field repulsive force .",
    "the theoretical description to this phenomenon is currently unavailable . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent experimental observations @xcite have shown that the internal magnetic field of a high-@xmath2 superconductor is strongly time dependent after a magnetic field ( below irreversible field ) is applied to the superconductor .",
    "the time scale depends on the sample geometry , temperature and applied field magnitude .",
    "this time dependence implies that a vortex system is unstable during the vortex penetration process and a superconducting device may not work properly at this stage . for the purpose of application , therefore , it is important to construct a mathematical model which includes the effects of the bulk pinning and internal field repulsive force , and can predicts the time scale of the vortex penetration process .    in this article",
    "i theoretically show that the vortex penetration process is time dependent because of the surface attractive force , bulk pinning force and internal field repulsive force .",
    "first , i discussed the field dependence of activation energy of the vortex penetration process .",
    "next , i discussed the time dependence of activation energy based on the arrenhius relation .",
    "finally , i derived a time dependent equation for the internal field in a vortex penetration process .",
    "as mentioned before , the vortices inside a type - ii superconductor are subjected to various forces and vortex motion is generally retarded .",
    "the experimental observations @xcite have shown that , at lower temperatures and under small applied fields , the time scale of vortex penetration process in a superconducting crystal sample extends to infinity long .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the vortices are at some metastable states under an intermediate applied field @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is lower critical field and @xmath5 is irreversible field . in this sense , the vortex penetration process can be regarded as a vortices diffusion process , i.e. , a process of vortices hopping between adjacent pinning centers . in an analogy to that of flux relaxation @xcite , we can described the vortex penetration process with the arrhenius relation : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is attempting frequency , @xmath8 is the activation energy of the vortices , @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath10 is temperature.@xcite this relation implies that the activation energy @xmath8 plays an important role in the vortices hopping .    in this work",
    "i am going to use some similar concepts and mathematical tools used in the studies of flux relaxation .",
    "but it should be emphasized that the physical contents of these two processes are completely different . in vortex penetration process",
    "the vortices are pushed into the superconductor by external driving force ; however , in flux relaxation process the vortices jump out of the superconductor because of various reasons @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the possible expression of the field dependence of activation energy @xmath8 in the vortex penetration process .      according to bean and livingston @xcite , a vortex close to the surface of a superconductor",
    "is subjected to attractive imaging force and external field repulsive force .",
    "the addition of these two forces results in the surface barrier to the vortex penetration , @xmath11 , which is determined by the sample geometry and external field magnitude @xmath12 .",
    "early studies have shown that @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath1 is flux quantum , @xmath14 is penetration depth and @xmath15 is the distance between the vortex and sample surface . the first term on the right side of eq.([us ] )",
    "is caused by the attractive imaging force , and the second term on the right side is caused by the applied field driving force . eq.([us ] ) shows that @xmath16 reduces exponentially with respect to @xmath15 , that is , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the vortices away from the sample surface are almost uninfluenced by the surface barrier .",
    "on the other hand , a vortex inside a superconductor is subjected to bulk pinning force and internal field repulsive force , which prevents the vortices motion and reduces the vortices hopping rate . according to the arrhenius relation , this internal field repulsive force increases the activation energy .",
    "therefore , the activation energy is an increasing function of the internal field @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the activation energy related to the bulk pinning and internal field repulsive force , we have @xmath21 .",
    "the exact form of @xmath22 is usually unknown because of the complexity of the interaction between vortices and pinning centers , as well as the reaction of vortices to external field driving forces . but from a pure mathematical consideration , we can express @xmath22 as a taylor series of @xmath19 ( or magnetization @xmath23).@xcite let us now write out the series expression of @xmath22 explicitly , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is the pinning potential inside the bulk of the superconductor .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) represent the weight of the contribution from inelastic deformation and interaction between the vortices , @xmath33 represents the weight of the contribution from elastic deformation of the vortices and @xmath34 represents the weight of the contribution from lorentz force.@xcite these coefficients are functions of temperature @xmath10 and can be denoted as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the total activation energy of a vortex , @xmath37 , is the summation of @xmath11 and @xmath22 , that is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the activation energy at vanishing internal field , or the activation energy at time @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is determined by the sample geometry , external field and pinning ability .    from eq.([us ] ) we see that the activation energy @xmath37 is a local function , i.e. , a function of position @xmath15 .",
    "this is not explicitly shown in eq.([uafield ] ) because we are interested in the field dependence of @xmath8 in the current work .",
    "the above discussion has shown that in vortex penetration process the activation energy @xmath8 is an increasing function of the internal field @xmath19 .",
    "it is also known that @xmath19 increases gradually with time @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 is an increasing function of @xmath42 .",
    "the rate of change of the internal field , @xmath43 , is proportional to vortex hopping rate . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath19 is an increasing function of @xmath42 in the vortex penetration process , i.e. , @xmath44 ( in relaxation @xmath45 ) . according to the arrhenius relation",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a positive proportional constant .",
    "eq.([uadiff ] ) can also be derived from the diffusion equation of flux flow ( conservation of flux).@xcite comparing to that of flux relaxation @xcite , eq.([uadiff ] ) has differences in sign and initial conditions .",
    "these cause the differences between the mathematical models of vortex penetration and flux relaxation .",
    "the exact solution of eq.([uadiff ] ) is currently unavailable , but we can find an approximate solution to it . consider applying a magnetic field to a superconductor at time @xmath40 .",
    "the activation energy of a vortex at this moment is @xmath41 , which is also the activation energy at zero internal field ( see eq.([uafield ] ) ) . as time increases to @xmath42 , the activation energy increases to @xmath8 .",
    "rewrite eq.([uadiff ] ) and integrate it on both sides ,    @xmath48    with logarithmic accuracy @xcite , we obtain the following equation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 $ ] is a short time scale parameter @xcite .",
    "eq.([uatime ] ) shows that @xmath41 has a strong effect on the time dependence of the activation energy @xmath51 .",
    "our final purpose is to obtain the time dependence of internal field @xmath52 . since the vortex motion in a vortex penetration process is retarded by various forces , the internal field increases gradually with increasing time .",
    "this relation can be obtained by canceling out the activation energy @xmath8 from eq.([uafield ] ) ( field dependence of @xmath8 ) and eq.([uatime ] ) ( time dependence of @xmath8 ) , that is , @xmath53 where @xmath54    to find out the time dependence of internal field @xmath52 , let us now invert eq.([wvsj ] ) by expanding @xmath55 $ ] as a series of @xmath56 , @xmath57 = \\sum\\limits_{l=1}^n b_l w^l(t ) = \\sum\\limits_{l=1}^n b_l \\left[kt ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t}{\\tau e^{u_0/kt } } \\right ) \\right]^l \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similar to earlier studies @xcite , we have the coefficients @xmath58 s +    @xmath59 \\\\     & \\cdots \\\\ & b_l=\\frac{1}{a_1^l } \\frac{1}{l } \\sum\\limits_{s , t , u \\cdots } ( -1)^{s+t+u+\\cdots } \\cdot \\frac{l(l+1)\\cdots(l-1+s+t+u+\\cdots)}{s!t!u!\\cdots } \\cdot \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^s \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^t \\left(\\frac{a_4}{a_1}\\right)^u \\cdots \\\\   & \\cdots \\\\     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 . on considering the symmetry between eq.([wvsj ] ) and",
