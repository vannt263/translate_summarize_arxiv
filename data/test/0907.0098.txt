    "the absence of diffusion of waves in disordered media was predicted by anderson 50 years ago @xcite .",

    "recently , direct observations of the anderson localization by disorder @xcite and of a localization transition by quasiperiodic potentials @xcite of quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) matter waves of ultracold atoms were reported .",
    "these experiments pave the way to the observation of new phenomena and shed new light on long standing problems , amongst which the question of possible anderson localization in presence of interactions .",

    "@xcite that a small amount of disorder does not drastically alter the _ equilibrium _ properties of the system , but merely decreases the condensate and superfluid fractions .",
    "furthermore , even in the 1d limit considered in the present work , it has been experimentally demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite that one can observe global phase coherence in the presence of disorder and remain far from , say , the bose glass phase originally proposed by giamarchi and schulz and fisher _ et al .",

    "here we are interested in _ transport _ properties . specifically , we study a quasi 1d , weakly interacting bose einstein condensate ( bec ) , propagating through a disordered potential . in this context",

    "@xcite ) . in the absence of an external potential ,",
    "( repulsive ) interactions make the system superfluid and introduce a new characteristic speed in the system , the speed of sound @xmath2 . as mentioned above , when the speed @xmath3 of the bec relative to the external potential tends to zero , the addition of a weak random potential preserves superfluidity , although with a reduced superfluid fraction .",
    "what happens as @xmath3 increases ?",
    "this question was investigated in a previous publication @xcite , where the disordered potential , of length @xmath0 , was modeled by a series of randomly located delta peaks . for small velocities",
    "@xmath4 , perturbation theory shows that the superfluidity is preserved , e.g. , the flow is dissipationless and with a perfect transmission .",
    "in contrast , in the high speed limit @xmath5 , where the kinetic energy dominates over the interaction energy , the transport properties of the bec are deeply altered , and tend to those of the non - interacting gas , displaying an exponential damping of the transmission with length @xmath0 , a behavior characteristic of the strong anderson localization .",
    "thus , two limiting cases of stationary flow have been identified @xcite , with contrasting transport properties : superfluidity in the deep subsonic regime , and anderson localization in the deep supersonic one . in between , in the region @xmath6 where both interaction and kinetic energies are important",
