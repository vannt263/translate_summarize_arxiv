    "epidemic spreading  @xcite and traffic dynamics  @xcite on complex networks have attracted much attention in the past decade . for a long time , the two types of dynamical processes have been studied independently . however , in many cases , epidemic spreading is relied on the process of transportation . for example , a computer virus can spread over internet via data transmission  @xcite .",
    "another example is that air transport tremendously accelerates the propagation of infectious diseases among different countries .",
    "the first attempt to incorporate traffic into epidemic spreading is based on metapopulation model  @xcite .",
    "this framework describes a set of spatially structured interacting subpopulations as a network , whose links denote the traveling path of individuals across different subpopulations .",
    "each subpopulation consists of a large number of individuals .",
    "an infected individual can infect other individuals in the same subpopulation . in a recent work",
    ", meloni @xmath0 @xmath1 proposed another traffic - driven epidemic spreading model  @xcite , in which each node of a network represents a router in the internet and the epidemic can spread between nodes by the transmission of packets .",
    "a susceptible node will be infected with some probability every time it receives a packet from an infected neighboring node .    despite broad interests in traffic - driven epidemic spreading ,",
    "the control of epidemic spreading by routing strategies has received little attention . in another recent work , meloni @xmath0 @xmath2 . observed that when travelers decide to avoid locations with high levels of prevalence , this self - initiated behavioral change may enhance disease spreading  @xcite .",
    "later , yang @xmath0 @xmath2 . found that epidemic spreading",
    "can be effectively controlled by a local routing strategy  @xcite . in the local routing protocol ,",
    "each node does not know the whole network s topological information and the packet is forwarded to a neighboring node @xmath3 with a probability that is proportional to the power of @xmath3 s degree  @xcite .",
    "it is noted that in the local traffic routing , the average traveling time of a packet @xmath4 is proportional to the network size @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "however , in global routing protocols such as the shortest - path routing , @xmath4 usually increases approximately logarithmically with @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "thus , from the view of transmission time , global routing protocols may be superior to local routing protocols .",
    "so far , the control of traffic - driven epidemic spreading by a global routing protocol has not been studied . to address the above issue",
    ", we consider an efficient routing strategy proposed by yan @xmath0",
    "@xmath1  @xcite . in the efficient routing protocol ,",
    "each node in a network is assigned a weight that is proportional to the power of its degree , where the power exponent @xmath6 is a tunable parameter .",
    "the efficient path between any two nodes is corresponding to the route that makes the sum of the nodes weight ( along the path ) minimal .",
    "it has been proved that the traffic throughput of the network can be greatly improved by employing the efficient routing strategy as compared to the shortest - path strategy  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we intend to study how the the efficient routing protocol affects traffic - driven epidemic spreading .",
    "our preliminary results have shown that there exists an optimal value of @xmath6 , leading to the maximal epidemic threshold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we formalize the problem by introducing the efficient routing strategy into traffic - driven epidemic spreading . in sec .",
    "[ sec : main results ] , we investigate the epidemic spreading on scale - free networks by considering two cases of node - delivering capacity , i.e. , infinite capacity and finite capacity . finally , conclusions and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "following the work of meloni @xmath0 @xmath1  @xcite , we incorporate the traffic dynamics into the classical susceptible - infected - susceptible model  @xcite of epidemic spreading as follows .",
    "\\(i ) _ efficient routing protocol . _ in a network of size @xmath5 , at each time step , @xmath7 new packets are generated with randomly chosen sources and destinations ( we call @xmath8 as the packet - generation rate ) , and each node can deliver at most @xmath9 packets towards their destinations .",
    "for any path between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , we define    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the degree of node @xmath14 and @xmath6 is a tunable parameter . for",
    "any given @xmath6 , the efficient path between @xmath3 and @xmath10 is corresponding to the route that makes the sum @xmath15 minimum .",
    "packets are delivered following the efficient path .",
    "when @xmath16 , the efficient path recovers the traditional shortest path .",
    "once a packet reaches its destination , it is removed from the system .",
    "the queue length of each node is assumed to be unlimited and the first - in - first - out principle holds for the queue .",
    "\\(ii ) _ epidemic dynamics . _ after a transient time , the total number of delivered packets at each time will reach a steady value , then an initial fraction of nodes @xmath17 is set to be infected ( e.g. , we set @xmath18 in numerical experiments ) .",
    "the infection spreads in the network _ through packet exchanges_. each susceptible node has the probability @xmath19 of being infected every time it receives a packet from an infected neighbor .",
    "the infected nodes recover at rate @xmath20 ( we set @xmath21 in this paper ) .",
    "in the following , we carry out simulations systematically by employing traffic - driven epidemic spreading on the barabsi - albert ( ba ) scale - free networks  @xcite .",
    "the size of the ba network is set to be @xmath22 . in the case where the node - delivering capacity is infinite ( @xmath23 )",
    ", traffic congestion will not occur in the network .",
    "when the node - delivering capacity is finite , traffic congestion can occur if the packet - generating rate @xmath8 exceeds a critical value  @xcite .",
    "therefore infinite and finite node - delivering capacity are considered respectively in the following sections .",
    "previous studies have shown that there exists an epidemic threshold @xmath24 , below which the epidemic goes extinct  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath6 for different values of the average degree @xmath25 of the network .",

    "this phenomenon can be understood as follows .",
    "an increase in the average degree of the network shortens the average time steps that a packet spends traveling from its source to its destination and decreases the number of packages passing through each node , leading to a decrease in the infection probability of each node .     as a function of the packet - generation rate @xmath8 for different values of @xmath6 .",
