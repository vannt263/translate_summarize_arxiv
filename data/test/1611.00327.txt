    "understanding of fully developed turbulence is a complex , rich , and challenging problem . among the most important features of such behavior are cascades of energy and intermittency .",
    "the former one brings energy from large scales , responsible for a creation of turbulence , toward smaller scales , in which viscosity begins to play a major role and dissipation effects dominate , whereas the latter one , being itself an irregular alternation of phases of some dynamics , in fact means that very rare configurations of a system give the most significant contributions to statistical distributions . for turbulence",
    "this fact is revealed in anomalous scaling , which implies singular behavior of various statistical quantities as functions of the integral turbulence scales  @xcite .    another very interesting problem is a turbulent advection of an impurity field .",
    "both natural experiments and numerical simulations suggest that deviations from the classical kolmogorov theory are even more strongly pronounced for passively advected fields than for the velocity field itself  @xcite .",
    "a turbulent environment in such models may be introduced by some `` synthetic '' velocity field with prescribed statistics or by stochastic navier - stokes equation  @xcite .",
    "models of the former type are more tractable from a mathematical point of view , whereas the latter models bear a closer resemblance to the real world .",
    "a very powerful theoretical framework , which has worked very well in statistical physics in order to investigate different models of critical phenomena , characterized by scaling behavior , is the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) and the operator product expansion ( ope ) ; it has become an indispensable tool when dealing with systems where no clear separation of scales occurs , see the monographs  @xcite . in the rg+ope scenario ,",
    "an anomalous scaling emerges as a consequence of the existence of some composite fields ( `` composite operators '' in the quantum - field terminology ) in the model with negative scaling dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this approach with respect to the turbulence is that it is based on a microscopic model and allows one to construct a systematic perturbation expansion for the anomalous exponents , similar to the famous @xmath4-expansion in theory of critical phenomena .",
    "the procedure has been successful in verifying kolmogorov scaling and provides an efficient theoretical tool for calculation of universal quantities  @xcite . in a number of papers",
    "the rg+ope approach has been applied to the case of passive advection by kraichnan s ensemble ( velocity field is taken isotropic , gaussian , not correlated in time , having a power - like correlation function , and fluid assumed to be incompressible ) , see  @xcite , and by its numerous generalizations : large - scale anisotropy , helicity , compressibility , finite correlation time , non - gaussianity , and a more general form of the nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach can be generalized as well to the case of non - gaussian velocity field , governed by the stochastic navier - stokes equation   both for the scaling behavior of velocity field itself , and for an advection of passive fields by this ensemble  @xcite .    up to now a majority of works on fully developed turbulence",
    "have been concerned with an incompressible fluid .",
    "nevertheless , several results for compressible fluids have also been obtained  @xcite .",
    "all of them hints at large influence of compressibility both to velocity field itself and passively advected quantities .",
    "in particular , the transition from a turbulent to a certain purely chaotic state may occur at large degrees of compressibility  @xcite .",
    "in other papers corrections in the mach number to the incompressible scaling regime were studied  @xcite .",
    "thus , obtained corrections become arbitrarily large and destroy the incompressible scaling regime for fixed mach numbers and large distances , what can be explained by an existence of crossover to another , yet unknown regime .",
    "the works  @xcite were devoted to a compressible fluid itself .",
    "the results are rather controversial , particularly the model , considered in  @xcite , appears to be in fact unrenormalizable . from a general point of view further investigations of compressibility are therefore called for .    in this paper",
    "we present an application of the field theoretic renormalization group onto the scaling regimes of a compressible fluid , whose behavior is governed by a proper generalization of the stochastic navier stokes equation  @xcite .",
    "a resulting stationary scaling regime in this approach is associated with an infrared ( ir ) attractive fixed point of the corresponding multiplicatively renormalizable field theoretic model . in a similar fashion as has been done for an incompressible case  @xcite , the double expansion scheme is employed . here the formal expansion parameters are @xmath2 , which describes the scaling behavior of a random force , and @xmath5 , i.e. , a deviation from the space dimension @xmath0 .    following a procedure of previous works  @xcite , first the stochastic navier - stokes equation is discussed . after establishing an existence of necessary fixed points of navier - stokes equation ,",
    "the advection of scalar fields is explored . since rg functions of the parameters , entering into navier - stokes equation , do not depend on the parameters , connected with advection - diffusion equation ,",

    "the inertial - convective range @xmath219 corresponds to the additional condition @xmath220 .",
    "the behavior of the functions @xmath212 at @xmath221 can be studied by means of the operator product expansion ; see  @xcite . according to the ope",

    "the correlation function  ( [ parr ] ) is obtained by averaging  ( [ ope ] ) with the weight @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the renormalized action functional  ( [ fact ] ) .",
    "mean values @xmath229 appear on the right hand side .",
    "their asymptotic behavior at small @xmath230 is found from the corresponding rg equations and has the form    @xmath231 , \\label{mean}\\ ] ]    with another set of scaling functions @xmath232 .",
    "since the diagrams of the perturbation theory have finite limits both for @xmath233 and @xmath234 , we may assume that the functions @xmath235 are restricted for all values of @xmath236 and can be estimated by some constants .",
    "moreover , for invariant variable @xmath213 ir asymptotic behavior together with requirement of its dimensionless gives @xmath237 where @xmath236 is renormalized speed fo sound .",
    "this means that @xmath238 .",
    "taking into account  , for non - local scaling regime fp@xmath138 one obtains that for @xmath239 ( i.e. , including the most realistic case @xmath43 ) the argument @xmath240 becomes small for fixed @xmath236 and @xmath241 , and the function @xmath232 can be replaced by its finite limit value @xmath242 . for local scaling regime fp@xmath137 from   it follows that at @xmath243 function @xmath232 can be replaced by its finite limit value @xmath244 . from these two remarks",
    "we finally conclude that in the ir range for both local and non - local scaling regimes up to a different constants we can write @xmath245 combining rg representation  ( [ parr2 ] ) with information gained from ope  ( [ ope ] ) and expression  ( [ mean2 ] ) gives the desired asymptotic behavior of the scaling functions : @xmath246 \\simeq \\sum_{f } a_{f } [ mr , c(r)]\\times ( mr)^{\\delta_{f } } , \\label{fin}\\ ] ] where the summation runs over all galilean invariant scalar operators ( including operators with derivatives , etc . ) , with the coefficient functions @xmath247 analytical in their arguments .",
    "the leading contribution into the sum   is given by the operator with the lowest ( minimal ) critical dimension ; the others can be considered as corrections .",
    "the anomalous scaling ( i.e. , singular behavior as @xmath221 ) results from the contributions of the operators with negative critical dimensions . from   and",
    "it is easily seen that for both scaling regimes all the operators @xmath174 have negative dimensions , and the spectrum of their dimensions is not restricted from below .",
    "fortunately , due to the linearity of initial stochastic equation   in the field @xmath90 , the number of such fields on the right hand side of expression   can not exceed their number on the left hand side .",
    "this means that for a given correlation function only a finite number of those operators can contribute to the ope . for correlation functions  ( [ parr2 ] )",
    "these operators are those for which @xmath248 .",
    "the leading term of the behavior as @xmath221 is given by the operator with the maximum possible @xmath249 and without any derivatives , so the final expression has the form @xmath250    the fact that the leading term in the ope is given by the operator from the same family with the summed exponent together with inequality @xmath251 can be interpreted as the statement that the correlations of the scalar field in the model   show multifractal behavior ; see  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , which is a natural extension of  @xcite , the stochastic navier stokes equation for a _",
    "compressible _ fluid has been studied using the field theoretic approach .",
    "in contrast to previous work , the model is considered in special space dimension @xmath0 . in this case",
    "additional uv divergence is observed in 1-irreducible green function @xmath252 .",
    "this fact significantly affects rg analysis , regarding both technical aspects and results .",
    "in particular , renormalization group technique with double expansion scheme is needed . in the one loop approximation , depending on the exponent @xmath2 and deviation from the dimension of @xmath48 space @xmath5 , the model possesses two stable nontrivial fixed points in the ir region ( i.e. , two possible nontrivial scaling regimes )   local one , called in text fp@xmath137 , and nonlocal , called fp@xmath138 .",
    "this shows that the simple analysis around @xmath1 , which indicates existence of only one nontrivial fixed point , corresponding to non - local scaling regime , can be regard as incomplete in this case .",
    "the crossover between local and non - local regimes occurs along the line @xmath253 , which is in accordance with  @xcite .",
    "the new ( local ) regime , which takes place at @xmath0 , should by continuity move into @xmath1 at @xmath243 .",
    "nevertheless , at physical values @xmath254 and @xmath255 new local regime fp@xmath137 is unstable , and non - local regime fp@xmath138 is realized , therefore the main conclusions of the previous papers  @xcite about existence and ir attraction of this fixed point remain true",
    ".    the model of passive scalar advection of density field by this velocity ensemble has been also analyzed .",
    "the full stochastic problem can be formulated as field theoretic model , which appear multiplicatively renormalizable .",
    "the new parameter @xmath256 does not affect to rg functions of the navier - stokes equation itself , so the critical behavior of this model is also described by two fixed points , local one and non - local one .",
    "the inertial range ( @xmath219 ) behavior of correlation functions has been studied by means of the ope technique .",
    "existence of anomalous scaling , i.e. , singular power - like dependence on the integral scale @xmath32 , has been established .",
    "the corresponding anomalous exponents have been identified with critical dimensions of certain composite operators and calculated in the leading one - loop approximation .    as in the case @xmath1 ,",
    "results of the present model have some similarities and some differences with simplified models , which describe compressible turbulent velocity field as some gaussian statistical ensemble  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite ( gaussian ensemble with finite correlation time ) , the present model is manifestly galilean covariant , and this fact holds in all orders of the perturbation theory . as in the rapid - change ( zero correlation time ) models ,",
    "critical dimensions are insensitive to the specific choice of the random force .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that propagator @xmath257 does not enter into the relevant green functions .    in principle",
    ", the anomalous exponents could depend on some dimensionless parameters like @xmath258 , @xmath259 , or @xmath260 .",
    "after the rg procedure , these parameters are replaced with the corresponding invariant variables .",
    "existence of the unique ir attractive fixed point for each pair @xmath261 shows that in the ir range these invariant variables tend to their fixed - point values @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 irrespective of the initial values @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "this is a consequence of the one - loop approximation ; in higher - loop level overlaps may occur in the picture of domains of ir stability .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath1 , at @xmath0 anomalous dimensions of composite operators   and   do not grow with @xmath38 without bound .",
    "this is a consequence of eliminating of poles in @xmath4 near @xmath0 , which leads to a significant improvement of situation near @xmath1 .",
    "the situation is similar to consideration of navier - stokes equation for incompressible fluid near @xmath53 , where renormalization procedure at @xmath53 is a reason for for the kolmogorov constant s better agreement with experimental results  @xcite .    as in the case",
    "@xmath1 , at @xmath0 the coordinates of both nontrivial fixed points are valid for all @xmath265 , have finite limits at @xmath266 , but ceases to exist for purely potential forcing , i.e. , for @xmath267 . this fact means that under the one - loop approximation both fixed points fp@xmath137 and fp@xmath138 appears to disappear or lose its stability . corresponding scaling regimes consequently undergoes some qualitative changeover , which is possibly accompanied by phase transition to a purely chaotic state observed in  @xcite for a simplified model .    to clarify this problem",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the one - loop approximation and to discuss the existence , stability and the dependence on @xmath38 of fixed points at least at the two - loop level , which seems to be a difficult technical task .",
    "also it would be very interesting to investigate a scalar admixture in case of tracer field , or passively advected vector fields .",
    "another very important task is to develop compressible navier - stokes equation near @xmath53 .",
    "such analysis may show another types of ir behavior or another dependence of different parameters like @xmath38 , viscosity ratios , etc .",
