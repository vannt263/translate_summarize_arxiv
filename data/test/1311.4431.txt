    "communication is a recently developed communication paradigm whose communication process involves `` transmission and reception of information encoded in molecules '' @xcite .",
    "it is born in the study of nano - scale communication in nanonetworks @xcite where the applicability of classical electromagnetic communication is limited by several constraints and a novel solution is called for .",
    "inspired by the biological communication process such as the intra- and inter - cellular communication by cells @xcite and the pheromone diffusion by insects @xcite , the researchers have created various message - carrying molecules and their corresponding receptors . since the molecules are themselves at the nano - scale , the difficulty of nano - scale communication is solved by building up communication media between the transmitter and the receptor .",
    "moreover , since the major potential application of nanonetworks is implemented in the organisms body ( e.g. , organ monitoring in human body ) , the compatibility of the bioinspired communication process makes it a perfect choice to consider the encoding , transmission , and decoding of messages in molecules .",
    "excited by the reasons above ( and beyond ) , the researchers have treated the molecular communication as one of the mainstream subjects of nanotechnology nowadays",
    ".    among the various proposed system blue maps for molecular communication , a specific class of system called the `` diffusion - based molecular system '' draws lots of interest due to the universality of _ mass transport phenomena _ in molecular communication .",
    "the mass transport phenomena refer to the propagation of encoded molecules in the communication media . in most cases ,",
    "the communication media of molecular communication are modeled as fluid . as is well - known , the motion of molecules in fluid media is governed by the `` diffusion process '' .",
    "the universality of mass transport phenomena not only make the study of diffusion - based system natural , but at the same time guarantee the widest possible generality of research results . to this end ,",
    "most efforts in molecular communication are devoted to diffusion - based systems , both in practical system design and information - theoretic analysis point of view .",
    "for example , for the practical system design , the physical phenomena of bacteria chemotaxis , pheromone diffusion @xcite , or calcium diffusion @xcite are adopted , and there are many existing systems operating on these phenomena such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the information - theoretic analysis of diffusion - based molecular system are also conducted in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    despite of this much effort for diffusion - based molecular communication",
    ", two important things are still lacking . first , _ an unified channel model for diffusion - based molecular communication",
    "is missing . _",
    "the existing works on information - theoretic analysis tend to be system - dependent ; that is , they are treating different kinds of diffusion - based systems independently and giving their own capacity analysis .",
    "so far , the most general result concerning the information rate capacity of diffusion - based molecular communication is probably @xcite where the authors have cleverly utilized the thermodynamics to derive the information rate capacity in closed form , but the result is only valid for receiver with poisson noise .",
    "second , and the more important one , _ no mathematical foundations have been put down for information theory in diffusion - based molecular communication_. in particular , the channel coding theorem is not proven for diffusion - based systems . to state more directly",
    ", no one has ever shown that , for the diffusion - based molecular channel , the information rate capacity ( maximum mutual information ) is equal to the code rate capacity ( supremum achievable code rate ) , where the former is a system statistic of mathematical importance and the latter is the real practical concern .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion - based molecular channels exhibit non - classical randomness ( which is explained later in section iv.a ) and _ no existing channel model apply to diffusion - based molecular channel_. therefore , the lacking of proof for equivalence between the information rate capacity and code rate capacity renders the purpose of calculating information rate capacity ambiguous , or at least in a shaky situation .",
    "this paper aims at solving the above two problems once and for all .",
    "let us first put molecular communication aside for a moment and recall the history of information theory .",
    "ever since the advent of the paper @xcite by shannon in 1948 , the `` channel capacity '' has been the primary subject of every communication systems . in particular , the way that shannon intervenes the information - theoretic and coding - theoretic quantities for discrete memoryless channels is the one that communication engineers imitate when treating the communication system under consideration . despite its great novelty and ingenuity , a complete and rigorous mathematical setting for information theory",
    "is not laid down until a series of papers by mcmillan @xcite , feinstein @xcite , and finally khinchin @xcite , where the definition of `` finite memory channel without anticipation '' is made precise and for such channels the equivalence between the information rate capacity and code rate capacity is established .",
    "a key step of @xcite is the _ measure - theoretic formulation for sources and channels_. khinchin noticed that except for some simple classes of channel ( e.g. , i.i.d . , markov , ... ) , the mathematical formulations of sources and channels are most conveniently made in the measure - theoretic form to provide rigorousness and applicability .",
    "later , works in @xcite are generalized by many others ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ... ) to include classes of channels other than finite memory channel without anticipation , all under the same proof structure .",
    "it is now a communication engineers consensus that the measure - theoretic formulations of source and channel have struck a perfect balance between the mathematical rigorousness of information theory and the applicability thereof to practical communication systems .",
    "therefore , for any communication system , once its channel abstraction is made in the measure - theoretic form and the corresponding capacity theorems are derived , then a solid mathematical foundation is laid down and applicability of information theory to the system is guaranteed .    in this paper",
    ", we shall follow the path of khinchin @xcite to provide the mathematical foundations for information theory in diffusion - based molecular communication . fortunately , there are already many building blocks from the works of predecessors @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . from these works ,",
    "the two crucial concepts of `` channels with asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation '' and `` @xmath0-continuous channels '' will be used heavily in our paper .",
    "we will give a channel model for diffusion - based molecular communication in the most rigorous language , namely the measure - theoretic one . the channel model we create",
    "captures the essential features of all existing diffusion - based molecular systems and all diffusion - based molecular systems to come , thus allowing our results the maximum possible generality . for our channel",
    ", we first prove its @xmath0-continuity and then utilize the @xmath0-continuity to establish various equivalence relationships between the statistical and operational definitions of channel capacity , including the equivalence of information rate capacity and the code rate capacity . in particular , the channel coding theorems for diffusion - based molecular channel is given .",
    "a solid foundation is therefore laid down and we can use the usual sense of `` channel capacity '' without worry thereafter .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows .",
    "we state the essential terminologies and notations in section ii .",
    "section iii introduces `` channels with asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation '' and `` @xmath0-continuous channels '' as well as their properties for our use .",
    "section iv is the main section in which we give the definition of diffusion - based molecular channel and prove capacity theorems , along with some discussions .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper in section v.",
    "we begin by setting up terminology and notation for sources .",
    "if a set @xmath1 is finite , the symbol @xmath2 will denote the set of all doubly infinite sequences @xmath3 , @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",
    "the notation @xmath6 denotes the finite sequence @xmath7 and @xmath8 stands for the set of all such sequences .",
    "given a sequence @xmath9 , there corresponds a cylinder set ( or rectangle set ) : @xmath10 the borel field generated by all cylinder sets in @xmath2 will be denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "a source is a probability measure @xmath12 on the measurable space @xmath13 and @xmath1 is called the alphabet of the source .",
    "the probability measure @xmath12 induces a sequence of random variables @xmath14 on the probability space @xmath15 by the formula @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . for",
    "integers @xmath18 and @xmath19 define @xmath20 as the borel field generated by random variables @xmath21 and we allow @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the induced sequence @xmath24 is viewed as the transmitted signal for each time @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represents all possible events in time @xmath18 to @xmath25 .",
    "besides @xmath24 , @xmath12 also defines a probability measure @xmath26 on @xmath8 by the formula @xmath27 when @xmath28 , @xmath26 is abbreviated @xmath29 . whenever we need to emphasize the alphabet or the induced random variables , we will also use the notation @xmath30 $ ] or @xmath31 $ ] to denote a source .",
    "the ( left ) shift operator @xmath32 on @xmath2 is defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the element at the @xmath19th position .",
    "a source @xmath12 is said to be stationary if @xmath35 a source is @xmath19-stationary for some positive integer @xmath19 if @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , @xmath12 is stationary if it is shift - invariant with respect to all events , and it is @xmath19-stationary if it is @xmath19-times shift - invariant with respect to all events .",
    "obviously stationarity implies @xmath19-stationarity .",
    "if @xmath12 is @xmath19-stationary for some @xmath19 , we say that @xmath12 is block stationary .",
    "a source @xmath12 is ergodic if for every @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 is either @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "an important property of the ergodic sources is the following :    for a given source @xmath30 $ ] , denote the characteristic function of the set @xmath37 by @xmath42 .",
    "then , we have for all @xmath37 @xmath43 if and only if for every @xmath44 such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 is either @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the necessity is provided by the well - known `` ergodic theorem '' of birkhoff and the sufficiency is a direct verification of the definition . for complete proof ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the summation appeared in the theorem represents the `` ensemble mean '' .",
    "* theorem 1 * therefore states that the ergodic sources are those whose features can be approximated well by ensemble statistics on observable samples .",
    "a discrete channel is characterized by an input alphabet @xmath1 , an output alphabet @xmath45 , and a set of probability measures @xmath46 on @xmath47 .",
    "the probability measure @xmath48 is determined for each @xmath17 such that for each @xmath49 the mapping @xmath50 is @xmath11-measurable .",
    "each @xmath48 is recognized as the output distribution conditioning on the input @xmath51 .",
    "we shall refer @xmath52 $ ] to such structure and say that @xmath52 $ ] is a channel .",
    "the channel is stationary if for every @xmath53 and @xmath49 we have @xmath54    now , consider the case of connecting a source @xmath30 $ ] to a channel @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "we are naturally led to consider the probability measure @xmath55 on the product space @xmath56 characterized by @xmath57 the event @xmath58 is interpreted as `` source emits event @xmath44 and the channel output receives @xmath59 '' . if we are interested in the output process , we shall consider the probability measure @xmath60 on the output space @xmath61 ) : @xmath62 the sequence of random variables induced by @xmath60 on @xmath61 ) will be denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "elementary analysis shows that if @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] are both stationary , then so is @xmath55 and @xmath60 .    in this paper",
    "we will encounter the `` cascade '' of channels .",
    "suppose that we are given two channels @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "if we have these two channels in cascade , the overall channel @xmath52 $ ] is described by @xmath66    another important notion of channel is the ergodicity .",
    "the channel @xmath67 is ergodic if for any input sequence @xmath51 , @xmath48 is ergodic .",
    "the following is an useful criterion for examining the ergodicity of a channel :    a stationary channel @xmath52 $ ] is said to be strongly mixing if for any input sequence @xmath51 and any two cylinders @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 where @xmath32 is the time shift operator . if a channel is strongly mixing , then it is ergodic .",
    ".    intuitively speaking , a channel is strongly mixing if for any two events separated by a long time at the output , the two events are `` almost ''",
    "independent , regardless of the input .",
    "we have seen that the source @xmath12 can be viewed as a sequence of random variables @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , we can view @xmath60 as @xmath63 and @xmath55 as @xmath70 .",
    "it is well - known that if the processes represented by these sequences of random variables are stationary then their entropy rates exist .",
    "since we shall only consider stationary ergodic sources and stationary channels in this paper , we are free to write @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 the mutual information rate between the input and output is defined as @xmath74 or , equivalently , @xmath75 in the rest of this paper we shall refer to these quantities interchangably in their measure forms and random variable forms .",
    "+ there are many defintions of channel capacity . in the followings we state and",
    "itemize them for ease of reference .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for detail descriptions of these channel capacities .    given a channel @xmath52 $ ] , there are several choices of source which we can extremizing the mutual information over .",

    "the diffusion - based systems refer to those systems whose communication media are described by the `` diffusion processes '' . in the following",
    "we introduce the essential components of diffusion - based molecular communication systems :          in molecular communication , the transmitter has many choices of information carrier .",
    "for example , we can embed the information in the molecule concentration magnitudes @xcite , the inter - transmission times @xcite , the relative transmission times @xcite , the molecule types @xcite , or hybrids of each other @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after the messages are encoded , the transmitter conveys the messages by simply releasing the encoded molecules into the communication media .",
    "+      on contrast to the variety of information carrier , to the present days the communication media of molecular communication are concentrated on the fluid media almost exclusively .",
    "the fluid media represent the environment where the communication takes places .",
    "a typical environment is the blood , where the communication process occurs at human vessels .",
    "as is well - known , the motion of molecules in fluid media is described by the `` diffusion process '' .",
    "the molecular communication systems whose communication media are described by the diffusion process are collectively called the `` free diffusion - based molecular systems '' or simply `` diffusion - based molecular systems '' . for systems operating under the diffusion process , there is a special type of randomness which distinguishes those systems from the classical communication : the disorder of message arrivals . consider an one - dimensional molecular communication system with transmitter and receiver separated by some distance ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for each released molecule diffusing independently in the fluid medium , the time it takes to be detected by the receiver is a random variable . if we assume that the receiver perfectly detects every molecule at its first arrival at the location of the receiver , then the detection times of the transmitted messages are the _ first passage times _ of the corresponding molecules , which are random variables depending only on the fluid medium , the corresponding transmitted molecules , and the distance from transmitter to receiver .",
    "denote the first passage time of the @xmath5th message by @xmath197 .",
    "it is possible to see that @xmath198 with positive probability even if @xmath199 , i.e. , it can happen that _ the later transmitted message arrives earlier_. more generally , if we release a set of molecules in sequence , then it can happen that the receiver receives these molecules in _ any _ order .",
    "the disorder of message arrivals is inevitable in diffusion - based molecular communication .",
    "rather unfortunately , the classical tools dealing with disorders of message arrivals are targeting at the link - layer disorders ( e.g. @xcite ) and do not suit the case of diffusion - based disorder . specifically , there are no existing mathematical tools describing the behavior of random ordering of arbitrary set of infinite random variables . to cope with it , we must develop useful channel model that describes the phenomena of the random ordering of first passage times , and by useful we mean the capability of applying the existing communication theory to the channel .",
    "the following is the strategy we take : we first find out the essential features of first passges times occurring in diffusion - based systems and define the notion of _ permutation channel induced by the random ordering of first passage times_. afterwards , we prove that the permutation channel is with adima , and apply the channel coding theorems to such channel .    despite the randomness described above , the first passage times in diffusion - based molecular systems do contain some regularities .",
    "the followings are the essential properties of first passage times in diffusion - based systems :    * we require that the @xmath200 is a _ delayed version _ of @xmath197 ; that is , there are two independent random variables @xmath201 and @xmath202 having the same distribution , and a random variable @xmath203 independent of @xmath204 and @xmath205 , such that @xmath206 @xmath207 + the above condition actually says that we are releasing the encoded molecules _ in sequence _ ( see fig .",
    "the intuitive meaning is that @xmath208 is the _ inter - transmission _ time of the @xmath5th and @xmath209th messages , and @xmath204 ( or @xmath205 ) is the first passage distribution of the @xmath5th message .",
    "if we release the @xmath5th message , wait for a time @xmath208 , and release the @xmath209th message , then the time it takes for the @xmath5th and @xmath209th molecules to diffuse to the receiver is of the above form .",

    "+ in the proof of * theorem 6 * we have shown that the diffusion - based molecular channel is an adima channel .",
    "since adima channel has its own coding theorems , it seems better to directly view the diffusion - based molecular channel as adima channel and not bothering using the @xmath0-continuity .",
    "this is , however , not appropriate due to the fact that the adima channel is very `` vulnerable '' to modeling errors .",
    "this is best illustrated by the following example .",
    "consider two i.i.d .",
    "binary sources with parameter @xmath361 and @xmath331 . recall that an adima channel demands the variational distances between distributions under consideration to be close , which is _ not _ the case for these two i.i.d .",

    "sources tends to @xmath41 as @xmath94 , _ no matter how small the error @xmath364 is_. the example tells us that if our model differs slightly from the reality , then the theorem might not carry over .",
    "unfortunately , the diffusion process is itself a mathematical assumption and not the physical reality . in particular , for the most widely adopted diffusion model , the brownian motion , various peculiar physical behaviors have been reported ( e.g. , almost - surely nowhere - differentiable path ) and now it is commonly accepted that the brownian motion is a good approximation of diffusion process but not the exact solution .",
    "there do exist realistic models for diffusion processes ( e.g. , the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ) , but they usually involve the `` stochastic differential equations '' which render the derivation of analytical results hard , if not impossible . +",
    "on contrast to the adima channel , the @xmath0-continuity is very `` robust '' to the modeling errors @xcite . in particular , by * theorem 5 * the @xmath0-limit of a sequence of @xmath0-continuous channels is @xmath0-continuous , while the limit of a sequence of adima channels is not necessarily an adima channel .",
    "this tells us that suppose we can approximate the `` true '' channel by a sequence of @xmath0-continuous channels , then the results we derived are still valid for the `` true '' channel .",
    "this is the reason we adopt the @xmath0-continuity in this paper . + * continuous alphabets are possible .",

    "we point out that there do exist works on the @xmath0-continuous channel with continuous input and output alphabets @xcite .",
    "the extension of our results to continuous alphabets is therefore possible . + * why ergodic sources ? +",
    "the notion of ergodicity comes from the statistical physics , where the introduce of ergodic process is used to describe a closed physical system . since a large application area of molecular communication is to monitor the physical systems occurring in biological world , we are naturally lead to consider the ergodic sources .",
    "besides , in most cases of communication a transmitter is itself a closed physical system , thus justifying the use of ergodicity .",
    "last but not least , the ergodic sources have so many strong mathematical properties that we could barely derive anything without it .",
    "we just ca nt help but using it ( and so do many great predecessors in information theory ) . + * why @xmath95 , @xmath128 , and @xmath97 ?",
    "+ @xmath95 clearly has its importance in coding theory .",
    "the importance of @xmath97 and @xmath128 is not so obvious , as we illustrated below .",
