    "disks are expected to form during protostellar collapse , and low - mass stars seem to provide good observational evidence for the existence of disks  a large body of t tauri observations is successfully integrated in a model based on circumstellar disks ( bertout & basri 1991 ) . on the other hand , in high - mass stars ,",
    "which form under different conditions with a strong tendency to cluster , the observational evidence for disks is less compelling .",
    "based on the seds of a sample of 47 herbig ae / be stars , the high - mass ( @xmath1 1.5 ) counterparts of t tauri stars , hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1992 , hsvk hereafter ) proposed that most of these objects too are surrounded by massive accretion disks .",
    "the seds were classified into three groups and hsvk suggested that the ir emission from the 30 objects in group i is generated purely in optically thick accretion disks .",
    "however , this proposal encountered some serious difficulties , summarized by evans & di francesco ( 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , from far - ir imaging of group i sources di francesco et al .",
    "( 1994 ) conclude that optically thick disks can not account for the observed far - ir emission and that another component is required , most likely a circumstellar envelope .",
    "hillenbrand et al .",
    "invoked the ir spectral behavior @xmath2 as the primary signature of optically thick disks .",
    "however , the emission from a spherical envelope with the density law @xmath3 obeys @xmath4 if the envelope is optically thin in the wavelength regime where the opacity varies according to @xmath5 ( harvey et al .",
    "interstellar grains have @xmath6 = 12 at ir wavelengths , thus the @xmath7 behavior is reproduced with @xmath8  1.5 , the expected spectral index of the density profile during the spherical collapse phase ( e.g.  shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "indeed , hartmann , kenyon & calvet ( 1993 , hkc hereafter ) produced models for spherical envelopes with @xmath0 density profile that closely resemble the observed seds of ae / be stars longward of  3  .",
    "but the flux emerging in the visible region was too small in these models and hkc suggested that there is a clear line of sight to the star through the envelope , perhaps cleared by bipolar outflows .",
    "the large axial cavities required by this proposal somewhat blur the distinction between disk and spherical geometries .",
    "a prerequisite for settling this important controversy is a definitive answer to the question : are spherical distributions at all capable of producing the observed seds of herbig ae / be stars ? and if they are , what is the minimal set of independent parameters that would have to be adjusted in fitting each individual source ? in this _",
    "we attempt to answer these questions .",
    "ivezi & elitzur ( 1995 ) showed that ir emission from late - type stars possesses general scaling properties .",
    "this result was recently extended to arbitrary systems  for any type of geometry and density distribution , infrared emission from radiatively heated dust possesses general scaling properties when the region s inner boundary is controlled by dust sublimation ( ivezi & elitzur 1996 ; ie96 hereafter ) .",
    "thanks to scaling , the number of free parameters is greatly reduced , enabling a systematic study of the spectral properties that can and can not be produced by any family of models .",
    "here we utilize the scaling approach for detailed modeling of the seds observed in herbig ae / be stars .",
    "we have developed a numerical code , described in ie96 , that solves exactly the radiative transfer spherical problem taking full advantage of scaling .",
    "only two scales need be specified for a complete solution when the shell s inner radius is controlled by dust sublimation  the sublimation temperature  and the overall optical depth at some fiducial , arbitrary wavelength . for simplicity , we choose  = 1500 k in all sources for both graphite and silicate grains .",
    "the small differences that may exist between these species , as well as variations of  itself , have a negligible effect on the results .",
    "we choose 0.55  as the fiducial wavelength that sets the scale of optical depth , and the corresponding  is the only free parameter allowed to be adjusted in modeling of individual sources .",
    "all other input properties involve dimensionless , normalized profiles that fall into three categories :    [ [ the - external - radiation ] ] the external radiation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    luminosity is irrelevant . the normalized profile @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is bolometric flux , is the only input required for the external radiation .",
    "for each source we use the spectral shape of the kurucz ( 1979 ) model atmosphere corresponding to the spectral type of the central star .    [ [ dust - optical - properties ] ] dust optical properties : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the magnitude of absorption coefficient is irrelevant , only the extinction spectral shape @xmath11 and albedo  enter .",
    "these quantities are determined by the grain chemical composition and size distribution , and we assume that both properties are uniform throughout the envelope .",
    "following draine & lee ( 1984 ) , the chemical composition is a mixture of astronomical silicate and graphite grains at the ratio @xmath12 = 1.12 .",
    "we take the graphite dielectric coefficient from draine & lee , the silicate from the more recent study by ossenkopf , henning & mathis ( 1992 ) .",
    "the size distribution is the one proposed by mathis , rumpl & nordsieck ( 1977 , mrn hereafter ) in which grain radii obey @xmath13 = 0.005  and @xmath14 = 0.25 .",
    "[ [ dust - density - distribution ] ] dust density distribution : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the density scale is irrelevant , as is the size scale of all geometrical dimensions ; both enter as one independent parameter , the overall optical depth .",
    "only the spatial distribution of dust , described by a dimensionless , normalized distribution , is required .",
    "introduce the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dust sublimation radius .",
    "the shell inner boundary is always at @xmath17 and the actual value of @xmath16 never enters . if the dust density is denoted @xmath18 , only the dimensionless , normalized distribution @xmath19 is required .",
    "we choose @xmath20 , attempting to model all sources with a single density profile .",
    "in the recent catalog of th ' e et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we have identified all the herbig ae / be stars with good spectral coverage from 0.3  to far - ir wavelengths , including iras data of reliable quality ; in some cases we improved on the listing in the iras point source catalog using the addscan procedure ( weaver & jones 1992 ) . among these sources",
    "we looked for those that meet the hsvk disk criterion @xmath7 for the underlying continuum to the longest wavelength observed .",
    "we then selected for detailed modeling those stars which show evidence for the 10  silicate feature commensurate with the standard @xmath12 ratio used here .",
    "the eight sources listed in table 1 , with spectral types from th ' e et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , meet all of these selection criteria and were used in the modeling presented here .",
    "a future detailed paper will present models for additional objects , including carbon - rich shells .    herbig ae / be stars show considerable variability .",
    "we have carefully studied all available data pertaining to the light - curves of our sources , including data from the recent long - term optical monitoring programs of manfroid et al.(1991 ) and shevchenko et al .",
    "the reddening some ae / be stars exhibit at visual wavelengths during brightness decreases is attributed to occultation by optically thick dust clumps in their envelopes ( e.g.  grinin et al .",
    "two of the sources selected for fitting ( kk oph , ww vul ) display such variability , and in each case we choose the observations at maximum visual brightness .",
    "other sources are not known as highly variable stars , and we simply average their photometric data . in most cases optical and ir observations",
    "are non - simultaneous ; for each source we tried to choose data as contemporaneous as possible .",
    "extinction of the stellar radiation is caused both by foreground interstellar material and the circumstellar shell , and normally it is impossible to distinguish between the two ; correction for interstellar reddening can not be performed when the shell effect is not known , and a model can not be fitted without reddening - corrected data . indeed , the procedure used by hsvk to estimate the interstellar extinction @xmath21 simply ignored the effect of the circumstellar matter on @xmath22 .",
    "however , within the context of a model for the shell , the two components can be disentangled with the aid of an additional color excess that is affected also by dust emission .",
    "this emission comes only from the shell 60  in some sources . ] and is significant only for @xmath23 23 , since shorter wavelengths require dust hotter than the sublimation temperature . in figure 1",
    "we show the data points in a diagram of the color excesses over naked star spectrum for @xmath22 and @xmath24 $ ] , where [ 12 ] is the 12  magnitude .",
    "corrections for interstellar reddening would move data points to the left parallel to the dotted line by distances proportional to the corresponding @xmath21 .",
    "our models produce a track in this diagram , drawn with a solid line , originating from the naked star location ( 0,0 ) , with distance along the track increasing with . in the absence of interstellar extinction",
    ", data points would lie on this line and their positions would determine the optical depth of each shell . the fact that within errors all the data points do indeed lie on the displayed track supports our model and indicates that @xmath21 could be negligible for all members of this sample .",
    "furthermore , figure 2 shows the spectra calculated for the optical depths  determined for each source from its location , within the errors , on the track of figure 1 .",
    "these models produce satisfactory fits for the raw data without any correction for interstellar reddening over the entire spectral range , not just the three wavelengths used for the determination of .",
    "this detailed agreement provides further support for our model .",
    "the large observational error bars and the similar slopes of the reddening line and our model track for @xmath25 introduce ambiguities into the determination of  and @xmath21 . for three sources ,",
    "reddening corrections performed within the bounds of these ambiguities result in equal or better fits , also presented in figure 2 ; in the case of iras 16372 - 2347 , this model noticeably improves the fit around 25 . in each case , the spectral shapes of the two models are identical for @xmath23 5  because the shells are optically thin at these wavelengths .",
    "table 1 lists the optical depths  for all sources , and @xmath21 and  for the three sources whose shell properties remain slightly ambiguous .",
    "our models provide some constraints on the dust properties .",
    "the sublimation temperature can be varied by a few hundred degrees around 1500 k with little change in the models .",
    "the only minor effect is a slight shift in the wavelength of the emission peak discernible around 23 . in the case of kk oph",
    ", this shift improves the fit for @xmath26 1000 k. the dust chemistry is primarily constrained by the strength of the 10  feature . for all the sources displayed here , @xmath12 can vary from its standard value by no more then  20% in either direction .",
    "it should be noted , however , that other sources , which we will analyze in a future detailed paper , give clear evidence for carbon - rich dust .",
    "a primary example is hr 5999 , as noted already by th et al .",
    "grain sizes are primarily constrained by @xmath27 and @xmath28 $ ] colors .",
    "we find that the distribution upper limit  must fall in the range 0.21  for these sources , and present in figure 1 the model track when  is increased to its maximum allowed value of 1",
    ". the lower limit must obey @xmath29 .",
    "both limits are consistent with the mrn estimates for interstellar grains .",
    "the spectral index of the dust density profile used in all our models is @xmath8 = 1.5 , as expected in free - fall accretion .",
    "satisfactory fits are produced only in the rather narrow range @xmath30 1.41.6 . at lower values of @xmath8 the near - ir bump",
    "is overly suppressed , at larger @xmath8 the far - ir radiation . however , there are herbig ae / be stars that show strong evidence for other density profiles , which we will present separately , presumably reflecting different evolutionary stages .",
    "our model results , shown in figure 2 , answer the questions posed in the introduction : the seds of these sources , primary examples of accretion disks according to hsvk , are successfully modeled with spherical envelopes that differ from each other in only one property  the optical depth , listed in each panel and in table 1 .",
    "furthermore , since these seds display the 10  feature in emission they _ can not _ be produced by optically thick accretion disks .",
    "irrespective of geometry , an emission feature is never produced if the source is optically thick in the corresponding wavelength regime . by contrast",
    ", the 10  optical depths of our spherical models vary from 0.01 to 0.1 .    because of the inherent scaling properties of the radiative transfer problem",
    ", modeling can determine  but can never provide information on density scale or physical dimensions .",
    "these quantities can be estimated only if additional information is provided . for luminosity @xmath31 in solar units , @xmath32 cm ( ie96 ) .",
    "the 100  radiation originates from regions where the dust temperature is  40 k , corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , a stellar luminosity of order 100  will result in shell sizes of order @xmath34 au at 100 , as observed ( e.g.  di francesco et al . ) . with standard gas - to - dust mass ratio  = 200 ,",
    "the gas column density outside the sublimation radius @xmath16 is @xmath35 @xmath36 . for free - fall accretion",
    ", this column corresponds to @xmath37  yr@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the central mass in solar units .",
    "it should be noted that if grains are depleted in the envelope ,  increases and with it the estimate of .",
    "our model envelopes are purely spherical .",
    "by contrast , hkc invoke large axial cavities in their spherical configurations even though they too attribute the ir emission to @xmath40 density distribution .",
    "hkc present two detailed model calculations .",
    "the one relevant for the sources considered here , because it displays the 10  feature in emission , has  = @xmath41 yr@xmath38 , corresponding to  = 3040 ; our calculations with such reproduce the sed presented by hkc . because of the large extinction of this model , the stellar radiation is heavily extinguished by the envelope . to produce the observed visual fluxes , hkc proposed axial cavities as a means to obtain a clear line of sight to the star so that in this scheme , the observed @xmath42 is determined purely by interstellar extinction .",
    "the ellipse marked hkc in figure 1 shows their model predictions , and all data points should congregate on the reddening line originating from it .",
    "instead , all the sources in our sample fall below this line , more than two standard deviations away . if @xmath21 is determined from , the hkc model predictions exceed the observed 12  flux by more than 2 magnitudes .",
    "one could attempt to modify the hkc approach with grazing rays , producing a partially obscured star , but this only exacerbates the problem because then the hkc ellipse moves upward and to the right in the diagram , away from the data points .",
    "the hkc model is not adequate for the sources in this sample because its optical depth is so large .",
    "if there is no dust depletion in these shells , the smaller optical depths required by the data imply mass loss rates 10100 times smaller than employed by hkc .    in conclusion , our study amplifies the findings by di francesco et al .  that extended envelopes , optically thin at ir wavelengths , dominate the ir emission from group i herbig ae / be stars . if present",
    ", optically thick accretion disks can only make a negligible contribution to the observed radiation .",
    "large axial cavities are not present in the sources modeled here .",
    "similarly , free - free emission by circumstellar gas , advocated by berrilli et al . , seems to be superfluous .",
    "we are grateful for the permission to use unpublished photometric data by drs .",
    "shevchenko and w.  wenzel .",
