    "weak magnetism reduces this cross section and impacts the deduced neutron star binding energy and antineutrino temperature .",
    "weak magnetism also changes the rate of antineutrino capture in the neutrino driven wind above a protoneutron star .",
    "this may change the electron fraction @xmath12 ( ratio of electrons or protons to baryons ) and nucleosynthesis yields in the wind @xcite .    however , to confirm this change in @xmath12 , one should perform supernova simulations including weak magnetism because this may change the neutrino luminosities and emitted spectra which will also impact @xmath12 . in this paper , we present simple formulae so that these corrections can be incorporated in simulations .",
    "we also give estimates of the change in emitted electron antineutrino spectrum and the differences expected between the spectrum of mu or tau antineutrinos and neutrinos .",
    "the reduction in opacities from recoil and weak magnetism should increase luminosities of both neutrinos and antineutrinos as more energy is transported to the neutrino sphere .",
    "this could increase heating behind the shock and more then compensate for the smaller antineutrino absorption cross section .",
    "weak magnetism should also reduce the cooling from positron capture on neutrons further increasing the net heating behind the shock .",
    "these changes in heating could make a simulation more likely to explode .",
    "finally , weak magnetism allows mu and tau antineutrinos to escape the star faster than mu and tau neutrinos .",

    "finally , we conclude in section vi that these weak magnetism and recoil corrections should be incorporated in future supernova simulations .",
    "recently , accurate numerical algorithms have been developed to solve the boltzmann equation for neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "the high accuracy of these simulations now warrants systematic improvements in the neutrino opacities .",
    "therefore , we discuss a number of opacity corrections .",
    "the corrections listed in table ii can be divided into two main groups .",
    "numbers 1 through 5 are classified as model independent because they can be calculated exactly and are independent of the model used to describe dense matter .",
    "in contrast , corrections 6 through 13 are model dependent .",
    "not only do these corrections depend on the model , but it is important that these corrections be consistent with the equation of state .",
    "corrections 1 , phase space , and 2 , matrix element are perhaps the simplest .",
    "these are the only ones that are present in the limit of very low densities .",
    "they represent more accurate calculations of free space neutrino - nucleon scattering . by phase space we mean corrections from the @xmath16 value of the reaction such as the neutron - proton mass difference or because the outgoing neutrino momentum is slightly different from the incoming momentum .",
    "in this paper we focus on number 2 , corrections to the matrix element .",
    "recoil corrections , 2a , arise because the nucleon is not infinity heavy and recoils slightly from the neutrino .",
    "weak magnetism , 2b , arise from the parity violating interference between the weak magnetic moment of a nucleon and its axial current .",
    "weak magnetism is important because it has opposite sign for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "thus weak magnetism increases the opacity for neutrinos and decreases the opacity for antineutrinos .",
    "the first effects of the dense medium are 3 , pauli blocking of some outgoing nucleon or electron states , and 4 , the fermi or thermal motion of the initial nucleon or electron .",
    "these can be calculated exactly .",
    "the final model independent correction in table ii is 5 , coulomb corrections .",
    "if heavy nuclei are present , the opacity may be dominated by coherent elastic scattering from nuclei . however , these nuclei have strong coulomb interactions and form a strongly correlated classical liquid",
    ". the correlations between ions can greatly reduce the opacity for low energy neutrinos that have wavelengths comparable to the distance between ions .",
    "this correction is model independent because the coulomb interaction is known .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the exact static structure factor of the ions with a simple monte carlo simulation . in principle , coulomb correlations are also present for neutrino electron scattering @xcite .",
    "corrections 613 depend on the model used for the strong interactions between nucleons .",
    "the mean field approximation , 6 , is perhaps the simplest way to treat the interactions .",
    "nonrelativistic mean field models incorporate mean field effects in the density of states with an effective mass .",
    "relativistic mean field models have both lorentz scalar and vector mean fields and the scalar field changes the effective dirac mass .",
    "it is important that the opacities be consistent with the model used for the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "this can be achieved by using linear response theory @xcite to calculate the response of the medium to a neutrino probe .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or sum of ring diagrams provides the linear response of a mean field theory ground state .",
    "therefore , if one uses a mean field eos and calculates the opacities in rpa , where the rpa effective interaction is the same as that used for the eos , then the opacities and eos will be consistent .",
    "for example , the relativistic rpa opacities of ref .",
    "@xcite are consistent with their mean field eos .",
    "we note that the nonrelativistic calculations of burrows and sawyer @xcite include corrections 1 , 37 however they do not contain any matrix element correction , 2 .",
    "likewise the relativistic rpa calculations of @xcite contain corrections 1 , 37 and 2a recoil but do not contain most of 2b weak magnetism . in the present paper",
    "we discuss weak magnetism corrections .",
    "in later work we will incorporate these into full nonrelativistic and relativistic rpa calculations .",
    "there are many @xmath17 correlations beyond a simple rpa approximation , 8 , for example those responsible for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in addition there are meson exchange current corrections , 9 .",
    "the stony brook group has done some work calculating corrections from hyperons or other strange hadron components , 10 , @xcite .",
    "more work could be done calculating opacities for meson condensates or other exotic phases of dense matter , 11 .",
    "if superfluid or superconducting phases are present there will be pairing corrections to the opacity , 12 .",
    "these can be important for the late time cooling of a neutron star @xcite or perhaps if there is a color superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "finally there could be important corrections to opacities in nonuniform matter , 13 .",
    "for example , in the low density pasta phases present in a neutron star inner crust or for a nonuniform meson condensate@xcite .",
    "all of the above assumed magnetic fields do not play important roles .",
    "if magnetic fields are important , they could substantially complicate the opacity , 14 , see for example @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields might be important in jets or to break the spatial symmetry to explain neutron star kicks @xcite .    to conclude this section , now that accurate neutrino transport is possible",
    ", it is important to systematically improve the neutrino opacities .",

    "we now discuss some possible implications of weak magnetism on neutrino heating , electron fraction and neutrino cooling in the low density region outside the gain radius .",

    "therefore , the net rate of @xmath3 absorption might be little changed .",
    "thus the electron fraction , which depends on the absorption rate , should not change greatly .",
    "however , the @xmath3s absorbed have a higher energy so the net heating should increase by about 10% because of the higher average energy in eq .",
    "( [ 59 ] ) .",
    "this assumes the luminosity of the @xmath3 changed only because of the change in @xmath200 . if the luminosities of @xmath53 and @xmath3 increased further because of the increased energy fluxes in fig .",

    "( [ 61 ] ) will be reduced by weak magnetism , @xmath208 at @xmath125 = 2 mev the factor in parenthesis reduces the cooling rate by 9% .",
    "thus weak magnetism can change the @xmath3 luminosity to increase the heating while , at the same time , reducing the cross section to decrease the cooling .",
    "these results should be checked with full simulations .",
    "in this paper we examine recoil and weak magnetism corrections to @xmath39-nucleon interactions .",
    "these are important because they are present at all densities , even at the relatively low densities near the neutrino sphere .",
    "furthermore , the corrections are model independent .",
    "we calculate simple , exact correction factors eqs . ( [ 12],[22],[32 ] )",
    "to include recoil and weak magnetism in supernova simulations .",
    "perhaps the most important effect of weak magnetism and recoil is to increase energy fluxes of both @xmath4 and @xmath3 antineutrinos .",
    "we calculate , in a diffusion approximation , an increase of order 15% in the total energy flux for temperatures near 10 mev .",
    "this should raise the neutrino luminosity .",
    "weak magnetism and recoil will also change the emitted spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath4 will be emitted about 7% hotter than @xmath5 because @xmath4 have longer mean free paths .",
    "likewise weak magnetism may increase the @xmath3 temperature by of order 10% .",
    "this increase in temperature coupled with the increase in neutrino luminosity should overcome the reduced absorption cross section and increase the heating in the low density region outside of the neutrino sphere .",
    "this , in turn , could be important for the success of an explosion .",
    "we find large corrections .",
