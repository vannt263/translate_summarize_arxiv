    "quantum tunneling is one of the major aspects of quantum mechanics that sets it apart from classical mechanics .",
    "the ability of a quantum system to enter a classically disallowed region and , through it , reach an energetically favorable region has inspired many applications . in this article , we are concerned with tunneling as it pertains to quantum annealing , which is a quantum algorithm that uses quantum effects , such as tunneling , to relax a system into a desired ground state .",
    "quantum adiabatic optimization ( qao ) @xcite is a form of quantum annealing that solves optimization problems by adiabatically changing the hamiltonian for a system from one with a known ground state to one with the optimization solution encoded in its ground state .",
    "many studies @xcite have sought to characterize what , if any , speed - up this algorithm has over classical alternatives such as simulated annealing or simulated quantum annealing .",
    "a popular belief among the qaocommunity is that at least part of quantum annealing s power comes from its ability to tunnel through barriers more easily than classical algorithms can go over them , but several recent results @xcite have shown that tunneling alone is not enough to ensure a quantum speed - up .",
    "nevertheless , generalized qaois universal for quantum computation @xcite , and an understanding of tunneling in a quantum annealing setting can shed light on the power and limitations of qao , even if tunneling alone is not enough for a quantum speed - up . to that end , this article studies quantum tunneling as part of qaoin the simplest possible situation : tunneling in position - space through a one - dimensional barrier . in a previous article @xcite",
    ", we showed that this simple problem is equivalent to barrier tunneling of @xmath0 qubits in a bit symmetric setting in the large @xmath0 limit .    despite the simplicity of one - dimensional position - space tunneling , we find that an asymptotic analysis of qaospectral gaps for @xmath2 , which give bounds on the adiabatic run time , fail to accurately describe the behavior of the tunneling for moderately large @xmath0 .",
    "we find that @xmath4 is needed to ensure that asymptotic expressions accurately describe behavior , to the point where polynomial and exponential run time scaling can be confused for lower @xmath0 .",
    "given the current and near - term sizes of quantum computer implementations @xcite , this failure of asymptotics casts doubt on the efficacy of using asymptotics to analyze the output of these systems or to predict their capabilities .    in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we provide a brief review of qaoand introduce the details of the barrier tunneling problem to be studied .",
    "we mention both the original hypercube problem and the simpler continuous one - dimensional problem .",
    "section  [ sec : trough ] gives the first evidence that the asymptotic limit may not be accurate even for moderately large @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the failure of the asymptotics is the same in both the hypercube and one - dimensional cases , proving that the failure is in the tunneling problem itself and not in the approximation scheme from @xcite .",
    "we compare the exact spectral gap to its asymptotic approximation in section  [ sec : exact_scaling ] to see where the issues discussed in the previous section arise .",
    "this section also provides estimates for the @xmath0 necessary to see asymptotic behavior and explores what effect next - order corrections to the asymptotics have on the analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : scaling ] uses properties of the derivatives of log - log data to analyze how well a curve approximates a power law versus and exponential fit .",

    "quantum annealing derives its name by comparison with classical simulated annealing , which starts a system at a high temperature and then slowly lowers the temperature , trying to relax the system into its ground state .",
    "quantum annealing works on the same principle except it uses quantum effects instead of temperature .",
    "as it is usually formulated @xcite , the quantum annealing hamiltonian is a linear time interpolation between two static hamiltonians : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time parameter , @xmath7 , divided by the total predetermined runtime of the algorithm , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the initial hamiltonian and is usually chosen to have an easily prepared ground state .",
    "@xmath10 encodes the solution to an optimization problem in its ground state configuration .",

    "the universality proof @xcite for qaorequires non - stoquastic hamiltonians , so it is currently unclear how much power stoquastic hamiltonians have in qao .",
    "key to qaois that the algorithm must run adiabatically , where adiabatically means that the total time , @xmath8 , scales according to a combination of matrix norms of time derivatives of @xmath15 and the spectral gap , @xmath16 , between the ground state and first excited state .",
    "typically , the adiabatic condition is stated as adiabaticity is ensure if @xmath17}||{\\frac{d \\hat{h}(s)}{d s}}||/(g(s))^2 $ ] .",
    "the derivation of this version of the adiabatic theorem is subtly incorrect , which has led to more robust statements and derivations of an adiabatic condition @xcite , but all of these more accurate conditions claim that the worst - case bound on @xmath8 depends on matrix norms , which in our case are linear in @xmath0 , and the inverse of @xmath18 } g(s)$ ] .",

    "the problem of tunneling through a barrier in a quadratic well is a simple quantum mechanical system with elements that are not unfamiliar to an introductory quantum mechanics class , so it is surprising that asymptotics have difficulty describing such an elementary system at reasonable system sizes .",
    "asymptotic analysis is deemed useful because it is assumed that the run time of an algorithm is well approximated by its asymptotic behavior starting at relatively small system sizes , @xmath0 .",
    "our study shows that barrier tunneling is a case where asymptotic behavior is not a good descriptor of spectral gap and therefore run time scaling until extremely large @xmath0 .",
    "this failure of asymptotic analysis is worsened by the direction of the failure : asymptotically polynomial algorithms appear to locally scale in a super - polynomial manner as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : poly_ratio ] , making it more difficult to justify the use of asymptotic analysis for small system sizes .",
    "quantum tunneling is a key part of many near - term quantum algorithms , including quantum adiabatic optimization .",
    "these algorithms are gaining popularity because of their applicability on smaller , possibly non - error - corrected , quantum computers .",
    "our results on the difficulty of describing barrier tunneling in small systems with asymptotic analysis suggest that care should be taken when analyzing the potential power of these algorithms for near - term experiments and systems ."
