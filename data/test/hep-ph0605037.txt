    "being the lowest bound state of two heavy quarks(charm and bottom ) with open ( explicit ) flavors , the @xmath8 meson provides a unique window into the heavy quark physics , which has caused wide experimental and theoretical investigations . after the report of the cdf collaboration on the observation of the @xmath8 ground state at the fermilab tevatron @xcite",
    ", people believe that it is possible to accumulate more @xmath8 meson events in the experiments at the tevatron run ii@xcite@xcite and the future cern large hadron collider(lhc ) . at the cern lhc with the luminosity of",
    "about @xmath9 one can expect around @xmath10 events per year@xcite . unlike symmetric heavy quarkonium ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 bound states ) ,",
    "the @xmath8 meson is composed of heavy quarks with different flavors and it lies below the @xmath13-threshold , so its decays via strong and electromagnetic interactions are forbidden .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the @xmath8 meson decay can offer special information compared to symmetric heavy quarkonium . in the framework of the sm",
    "its decays can occur via three mechanisms : ( 1 ) the c - quark decay with the b - quark being a spectator , ( 2 ) the b - quark decay with the c - quark being a spectator , ( 3 ) b - quark and c - quark annihilation .",
    "the first two mechanisms are expected to contribute about @xmath14 of the total width , and the remaining @xmath15 is owed to the annihilation process .",
    "there is another decay mode which does not belong to the three aforementioned types , and it can only occur via the ozi processes . as we know that the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule@xcite plays an important role in the processes which occur via strong interaction and in general at the parton level the concerned calculations are carried out in the framework of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "thus careful studies on these ozi - forbidden processes can deepen our insight to the perturbative qcd .",
    "but these processes are very difficult to evaluate , because one not only needs to carry out complicated loop calculations at the parton level , but also has to deal with the non - perturbative effects of the qcd , which is involved in the hadronization of partons . because of lack of solid knowledge on the non - perturbative qcd , for the whole calculation one has to adopt concrete models which may contaminate the theoretical results .",
    "the factorization scheme is just to properly separate calculable perturbative part from the non - perturbative contributions which must be evaluated either in terms of experimental data or using concrete models@xcite . in estimating the b decays ,",
    "model - dependent wave - functions are adopted for the light mesons which are the final decay products . among most of the commonly used wave - functions ,",
    "the light - cone wave - function is more favorable , because the finally produced mesons are light and so that should be more relativistic",
    ". obviously the errors brought out by using such model - dependent wave - function are not accurately estimated , but in some sense they are controllable while one uses as much as possible information from available data . in order to reduce the theoretical uncertainties of the non - perturbative qcd",
    ", the meson wave functions should be well theoretically investigated and experimentally tested .",
    "to gain more knowledge about the whole picture , one hopes to make the part which can be calculated in the framework of the perturbative qcd , as accurate as possible and to employ more reasonable model - dependent wave - functions which have been tested by fitting data obtained from precise measurements to gain final results .",
    "comparing the results with experimental data , one may obtain information about both governing mechanisms which are calculated in perturbative framework and the wave - functions . in the case",
    ", we can also find a trace of new physics .",
    "the ozi - forbidden process @xmath2 was studied by sugamoto and yang years ago @xcite . in their work",
    ", an effective lagrangian was adopted to avoid introducing the @xmath16 meson wave function , meanwhile they dealt with the light meson by using an effective @xmath17 coupling @xcite@xcite , which was obtained in the nrqm(non - relativistic quark model ) approximation .",
    "the valence quark @xmath18 and anti - quark @xmath19 in the light meson were assumed to possess equal momenta and be on their mass shells , i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with such approximation and kinematic assumption",
    ", they tactfully reduced the complicated feynman four - point and five - point integral functions@xcite to be expressed in three - point functions .",
    "as for the heavy meson @xmath8 , the authors neglected the relative momentum and binding energy of heavy quark constituents .",
    "then they obtained a reasonable branching ratios of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore they estimated the branching ratio of @xmath23 based on @xmath24 decay .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the ozi forbidden@xcite @xmath25 rare decay of @xmath26 in the perturbative qcd without any effective coupling approximation and kinematic assumption in one - loop feynman diagram evaluation .",
    "while calculating the amplitudes of these decay processes , we have to properly deal with the dynamics of bound states . as for the @xmath8 meson",
    ", we adopt the way similar to that shown in ref.@xcite , namely , we ignore the relative momentum of the two heavy constituents and their binding energy in comparison with their masses .",
    "furthermore , it is commonly assumed that the constituents of @xmath8 are on mass shell and move together with the same velocity for simplicity . in dealing with the final light meson states , we keep an arbitrary relative momentum for the light quarks @xmath18 and @xmath19 and take the valence quarks ( anti - quarks ) of the light mesons to be on their mass shells . due to the mass difference between up , down and strange quarks , the decay widths of processes @xmath27 would receive non - zero contributions . by this method , obviously , the advantages of simplifying the loop integral calculations vanish .",
    "namely , one can not reduce the five - point and four - point loop integral functions into simple expressions involving three - point integral functions .",
    "however , with the progress in the technique of calculating loop diagrams , we can directly calculate the five - point and four - point one - loop integrals numerically in general case without any additional approximation and kinematic assumption@xcite .",
    "then we can obtain non - zero rates for the decay modes which obviously violate isospin .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we derive the amplitudes .",
    "the numerical results of the decay rates for the @xmath28 processes are presented in section 3 , along with all the necessary parameters being listed explicitly .",
    "finally , the conclusion is drawn in the last section .",
    "being ozi - forbidden processes , there is no contribution at the tree - level for the decay channel @xmath29 , and at one - loop level six diagrams which contribute to the decay width , are shown in fig.1 . here",
    "@xmath30 stands for a pseudoscalar meson @xmath31 , and @xmath32 or @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the six diagrams can be divided into three parts as fig.1 ( a , d),(b , e ) and ( c , f ) .",
    "it is clear that the figures in fig.1(d),(e ) and ( f ) can be obtained by exchanging two internal gluons of the corresponding diagrams in fig.1(a),(b ) and ( c ) , respectively .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we carry out the integration of the scalar and tensor four- and five - point integral functions precisely .",
    "we adopted the ff package@xcite in the calculation of two- , three- and four - point integral functions , while the implementations of the scalar and the tensor five - point integrals are done exactly by using the fortran programs as we used in our previous works on @xmath34 and @xmath35 processes@xcite by using the approach presented in ref.@xcite .    in order to model the light hadronic effects , we use three different types of wavefunctions for light mesons in our calculation .",
    "we present the theoretical predictions on the decay widths of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the rest frame of @xmath8 , corresponding to the three different leading twist light - cone wavefunctions of light mesons respectively in table 1 .",
    "in this work , we studied the ozi forbidden quark - level sub - processes of @xmath0 in the framework of the perturbative qcd . for @xmath39 process , within reasonable ranges of the masses of u and d quarks ,",
    "the branching ratio with the distribution amplitude @xmath40 can be about one order larger than other two distribution amplitudes ( @xmath41 ) and can reach the order of @xmath6 with specific light quark masses . for @xmath42 process , the branching ratios turn out to be of the order @xmath7 for distribution amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and about @xmath6 for distribution amplitude @xmath40 . for @xmath45 decay , the @xmath40 can give the branch ratio values of the order @xmath5 .",
    "these results seem to be at the reach of future experiments at the lhc where it is expected to produce @xmath46 @xmath8 meson events per year with @xmath47 and luminosity @xmath48@xcite .",
    "we conclude that the decays @xmath49 could be investigated experimentally at the lhc , and the study on these decays can deepen our understanding on both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd .",
