    "this is the first in a series of articles on a comprehensive , comparative , direct analysis of spectra of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "we are using the parameterized resonance  scattering synthetic  spectrum code  to fit all of the sn  ia spectra ( other than very late  time spectra ) that are available to us .",
    "our motivations include the following .",
    "first , the process of extracting information from supernova spectra begins with line identifications , but the identifications of some sn  ia spectral features remain uncertain , and conflicting identifications can be found in the literature .",
    "we hope to improve this situation .",
    "second , we will generate an ensemble of  fitting parameters that will provide an internally consistent quantification of the spectroscopic differences among sne  ia .",
    "this should lead to an improved understanding of how the various manifestations of sn  ia diversity are related to their physical causes .",
    "this article is concerned only with sn  1994d , a well observed , spectroscopically normal sn  ia that will serve as a standard of comparison for our analyses of other sn  ia spectra . in forthcoming articles we will present results for normal sne  ia , and then for peculiar sne  ia .    in this article",
    "we confine our attention to optical spectra , from the ca  ii h&k blend ( @xmath0weighted rest wavelength 3945 ) in the blue to the ca  ii infrared triplet ( ca  ii ir3 ; @xmath0weighted rest wavelength 8579 ) in the red .",
    "the 26 spectra selected for study ( table  1 ) include 15 from patat et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , 8 from filippenko ( 1997 ) , and 3 from meikle et  al .",
    "they range from 12 days before to 115 days after the date of maximum light in the @xmath1 band , 1994 march  21 .",
    "( we also will comment on a spectrum obtained 283 days after maximum light . )",
    "all spectra have been corrected for the 448  redshift of the parent  galaxy , ngc  4526 , but not for interstellar reddening , which is believed to be small .",
    "the elements of line formation in supernova spectra have been discussed and illustrated by jeffery & branch ( 1990 ) and branch , baron & jeffery ( 2003 ) , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the code is based on simple assumptions : spherical symmetry ; homologous expansion ( @xmath2 ) ; a sharp photosphere that emits a blackbody continuous spectrum ; and line formation by resonance scattering , treated in the sobolev approximation .",
    "a synthetic spectrum consists of blended p  cygni profiles ( unshifted emission component , blueshifted absorption component ) superimposed on a continuum .",
    "does not do continuum transport , it does not solve rate equations , and it does not calculate ionization ratios . its main function is to take line multiple scattering into account so that it can be used in an empirical spirit to make line identifications and estimate the velocity at the photosphere ( or pseudo  photosphere ) and the velocity interval within which each ion is detected .",
    "these quantities provide constraints on the composition structure of the ejected matter .    for each ion that is introduced , the optical depth of a reference line at one velocity ( ordinarily the velocity at the photosphere ) is a fitting parameter and the optical depths of the other lines of the ion at that velocity are calculated assuming boltzmann excitation at temperature @xmath3 . in this article , to keep the number of fitting parameters under control , @xmath3 is taken to have the same value for all ions at a given epoch : 10,000  k at premaximum and near  maximum epochs and 7000  k for postmaximum epochs .",
    "all line optical depths are taken to decrease exponentially with velocity , with e  folding velocity @xmath4 usually taken to be 1000 . at each epoch , the important fitting parameters are the velocity at the photosphere , @xmath5 , the optical depths of the ion reference lines , and whatever minimum and maximum velocities may be imposed on individual ions . when a minimum velocity is imposed that exceeds the velocity at the photosphere , the ion is said to be detached ( from the photosphere ) at that minimum velocity .",
    "the temperature of the blackbody continuum @xmath6 is chosen to fit the overall slope of the spectrum ; its value has limited physical significance because ( 1 ) the true continuum ( or quasi ",
    "continuum ) is not planckian and ( 2 ) interstellar extinction and wavelength  dependent errors in the observed spectrum can affect the best fitting value of @xmath6 .",
    "we begin with the spectrum that is nearest to maximum light , at day  @xmath7 . in figure  1",
    "it is compared with a synthetic spectrum that has @xmath8 , @xmath9  k , and includes lines of ten ions :",
    "o  i , na  i , mg  ii , si  ii , si  iii , s  ii , ca  ii , fe  iii , co  ii , and ni  ii .",
    "a value of @xmath10  is used for all ions .",
    "ions responsible for absorption features in the synthetic spectrum are labelled .",
    "optical depths of the reference lines are in table  1 .",

    "the presence in the observed spectrum of na  i , co  ii , and ni  ii is not definite , but we use their lines in the synthetic spectrum because the na  i d  lines improve the fit to the observed absorption near 5770 , co  ii lines improve the fit to the observed absorption near 4020 , and ni  ii lines lower what otherwise would be an excessively high ca  ii h&k emission peak .    on the whole",
    "the fit is good , by supernova standards , although there are discrepancies .",
    "the optical depths of the ca  ii photospheric and high  velocity components are chosen to fit the observed ca  ii ir3 features because , being weaker than ca  ii h&k , they are more sensitive to optical depth ; this results in the synthetic ca  ii h&k absorptions ( both photospheric and high  velocity ) being too deep .",

    "for some of the ions a value of @xmath4 other than 1000  is used to improve the fit , but the @xmath4 values are not well determined .",
    "the fit is good and all discrepancies are mild .",
    "we are confident of the presence in the observed spectrum of o  i ( photospheric ) , mg  ii , si  ii , si  iii , s  ii , ca  ii ( both photospheric and high  velocity ) , fe  iii , and high  velocity fe  ii . based on the spectra of sn  1994d alone , the case for the presence of c  ii lines might not be convincing , but since we are confident of their presence in early spectra of some other sne  ia , ( e.g. , sn  1998aq ; branch et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and they do improve the fits for sn  1994d , we believe that they are present in sn  1994d . the spectroscopic case for detached high  velocity o  i , based on one weak feature , is not compelling , but the possibility of detecting it has been discussed by gerardy et  al .",

    "we use @xmath17  for most ions .",
    "the fit is good although there are several discrepancies .",
    "we are confident of all identifications given in figure  4 , except for na  i. because the observed spectrum does not extend to ca  ii ir3 , and the ca  ii h&k feature is so broad and deep that the photospheric and detached components are badly blended , the fitting parameters for the photospheric and detached ca  ii components are very poorly constrained .",

    "note that in the full synthetic spectrum the s  ii absorptions appear to be weak , while in the synthetic spectrum without the high  velocity fe  ii lines they appear stronger , even though their optical depths have not changed .",
    "this means that their apparent weakness in the full synthetic spectrum , and in the observed spectrum , is not because of a lack of optical depth in the s  ii lines , but because they are partially filled in by the p ",

    "reference  line optical depths for all of our premaximum fits , including those that are not displayed in figures , are listed in table  1 .",

    "the large changes in the photospheric and detached ca  ii optical depths from day  @xmath19 to day  @xmath11 are a consequence of only the h&k feature being covered in the former spectrum and only the ir3 feature in the latter .    before leaving the premaximum phase we should mention that the day  @xmath19 and day  @xmath18 spectra contain a weak absorption feature near 6630  that has a full width of only 270 .",
    "the feature apparently is real ( f.  patat , personal communication ) .",
    "we are unable to suggest a plausible identification .",
    "it probably is not he  i 6678 because there is no corresponding feature that could be attributed to 5876 , which should be stronger .",
    "an absorption feature due to h@xmath20 , redshifted by 3000  and therefore implying infall , also seems unlikely .",
    "similar features should be sought in spectra of other sne  ia .",

    "we refer to the interval from day  @xmath22 to day  @xmath21 as the postmaximum si  ii phase because the 6130absorption is deep and apparently unblended , at least in its core .",
    "the wavelength of the absorption minimum hardly changes during this phase .",
    "the s  ii features gradually disappear ; they are still visible ( barely ) at day  @xmath23 , but not at day  @xmath21 .",
    "the absorption observed at 5770  on day  @xmath7 shifts blueward to 5690  by day  @xmath21 and develops an extended blue wing .",
    "we attribute this to strengthening of the na  i d  lines .",
    "the gradual changes at wavelengths shorter than 5200  are due to the fading of mg  ii , si  iii , and fe  iii and the development of co  ii and fe  ii ( see the reference  line optical depths in table  1 ) .",

    "the 6130  si  ii absorption is beginning to be flanked by weak fe  ii features ( see  3.4 ) that are too weak in the synthetic spectrum .      at this point",
    "we switch from plotting flux per unit frequency interval to flux per unit wavelength interval , because the spectra are becoming redder and flux per unit wavelength interval makes the spectra look flatter and easier to inspect .",

    "@xmath27 the core of the deep red si  ii absorption begins to appear blended on its red side . at day",
    "@xmath26 the very core of the si  ii absorption is still present , but strongly blended on both sides , due to the strengthening of fe  ii lines . during this phase",
    "a striking spectral evolution occurs in the 5200  to 5600  region . as a weak absorption at 5350strengthens",
    ", the ratio of the flanking emission peaks evolves very strongly , from slightly higher on the left side of the absorption at day  @xmath27 to much higher on the right side at day  @xmath26 .",
    "our fits nicely account for this evolution in terms of strengthening fe  ii and cr  ii lines .",

    "at this and other epochs from day  14 to day  115 , the imposition of a maximum velocity of 13,000  on cr  ii , fe  ii , and co  ii improves the fit .",
    "note that the two flux peaks that flank the 5350  absorption , mentioned in the previous paragraph , are well matched .",
    "the spectrum between the ca  ii h&k and na  i features remains a complex blend of many lines , but now mainly fe  ii , with some contributions from co  ii and cr  ii .",
    "we believe that the line identifications in figure  8 are correct as far as they go , but we have not found a plausible way to remove the discrepancy to the right of the 6500  flux peak .",
    "figure  9 shows five observed spectra , from day  @xmath26 ( repeated from figure  7 ) to day  @xmath30 .",
    "we refer to the interval from day  @xmath31 to day  @xmath32 as the fe  ii phase , because the si  ii line is all but gone ( in our synthetic spectrum for day  @xmath33 , si  ii detached at 9000  still has a small effect ) and apart from the persistent ca  ii and na  i features the spectrum is mainly shaped by fe  ii lines .",
    "most of the spectral features retain their identities and evolve slowly during this phase , although the na  i feature becomes much stronger , and an apparent emission peak develops at 7370 .",
    "the day  @xmath31 spectrum can be fit about as well as the day  @xmath26 spectrum ( figure  8) , in much the same way .    figure  10 compares the day  @xmath32 spectrum with a synthetic spectrum that has @xmath34 , @xmath35  k , and includes lines of only four ions : na  i , ca  ii , fe  ii , and co  ii .",
    "the high value of @xmath6 was chosen on the basis of wavelengths longer than 4500 ; this leaves the synthetic spectrum much too high at wavelengths shorter than 4400 .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to a strong departure from an underlying blackbody continuum , and to severe underblanketing in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "( lines of neutral iron ",
    "group elements may help to blanket the observed spectrum at this epoch ; see pastorello et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) on the spectrum of the type  ii sn  1998a . )",
    "the synthetic spectrum also fails completely from 6600  to 7600 .",
    "nevertheless , the fit from 4500  to 6500 , although not good , is sufficient to suggest that , contrary to what is usually assumed , the spectrum at 100  days postmaximum is not just a blend of forbidden emission lines  it is largely shaped by permitted fe  ii lines , especially in the blue .",
    "the overall shape of the day  @xmath30 spectrum ( figure  9 ) differs from that of the day  @xmath32 spectrum , and the assumption of an underlying blackbody continuum at day  @xmath30 would be completely untenable , yet most of the flux minima are at practically the same wavelengths in these two spectra . if the day  @xmath30 spectrum consisted just of forbidden emission lines , with no absorption features , these similarities would be strangely coincidental .",
    "however , ca  ii h&k absorption is apparent in the day  @xmath30 spectrum , and ca  ii ir3 and na  i absorptions appear to be present as well .",
    "in addition , the sharp absorption at 4100  may be produced by ca  i 4226 ( a resonance line ) , blueshifted by 8900 .",
    "the extent to which sn  ia spectra as late as day  @xmath30 are affected by fe  ii permitted lines , as well , will be addressed in a future article , when we have the opportunity to study spectra in the interval between day  @xmath32 and day  @xmath30 .",
    "we have been able to identify nearly all of the spectral features of sn  1994d with lines of plausible ions  mostly in the same way they have been identified in spectra of normal sne  ia before ( e.g. , branch et  al .",

    "our fits to all but the latest spectra are satisfactory , considering the approximations made , which include spherical symmetry .",
    "qualitatively , our results are consistent with the traditional view that the sn  ia composition structure is strongly radially stratified ( figure  11 ) , e.g. , c  ii only above 13,000  and o  i only above 12,000  .",

    "however , a few of the quantitative implications of our present results should be mentioned .",
    "since we have invoked the presence of permitted fe  ii , ca  ii , and na  i features at relatively late times , we make rough estimates of the amount of mass in these ionization states that would be needed to produce the optical depths . for a given ionization stage ,",

    "briefly , we find the following : ( 1 ) the iron responsible for the detached high  velocity features at early times was not formed from the decay of @xmath53ni through @xmath53co , otherwise ni  ii and co  ii lines would be too strong .",

( 4 ) if the ni  ii identifications from day  10 to day  17 are correct , then the nickel responsible for these features can not have been formed as @xmath53ni , but must have been synthesized directly , as stable @xmath55ni .",
