    "the rare decays @xmath1 are among the most important probes of flavour physics .",
    "they are potentially sensitive to dynamics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and have been intensely studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "measurements have been performed at the @xmath0-meson factories and at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "excellent future prospects for detailed measurements are provided by the lhc experiments atlas , cms , and lhcb at cern @xcite , and , in the longer run , by super flavour factories based on @xmath7 colliders .",
    "the calculability of @xmath1 decay rates and distributions benefits from the fact that these processes are , to first approximation , semileptonic modes .",
    "correspondingly , the hadronic physics is described by @xmath8 form factors , which multiply a perturbatively calculable amplitude .",
    "this simple picture is not exact because also the nonleptonic weak hamiltonian at scale @xmath9 has @xmath1 matrix elements .",
    "the prominent example is given by hadronic interactions of the form @xmath10 , where the charm quarks annihilate into @xmath11 through a virtual photon .",
    "such charm - loop contributions are more complicated theoretically than the form - factor terms .",
    "even though the charm loops are subdominant numerically in the kinematical regions of interest , they can not be completely neglected . in particular",
    ", the related uncertainty needs to be properly estimated in order to obtain accurate predictions .",
    "we need to distinguish three regions in the dilepton invariant mass @xmath2 , for which the properties of charm loops are markedly different . for @xmath12",
    "the presence of very narrow @xmath13 resonances leads to huge violations of quark hadron duality @xcite and the hadronic backgrounds from @xmath14 , followed by @xmath15 , dominate the short distance rate by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this region in @xmath2 can be removed by experimental cuts .",
    "for @xmath16 the kaon is very energetic and the charm loops can be computed systematically in the heavy - quark limit using qcd factorization for @xmath0 decays into light - like mesons @xcite .",
    "this approach was first employed for @xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "the results have many applications .",
    "a summary with detailed references can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent analysis ) .",
    "the high-@xmath2 region , @xmath17 has received comparatively little attention . in this case",
    "the kaon energy is around a @xmath18 or below , and ( soft - collinear ) qcd factorization is less justified , becoming invalid close to the endpoint of the spectrum at @xmath19 . on the other hand , the large value of @xmath2 defines a hard scale for the hadronic contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "consequently an operator product expansion ( ope ) can be constructed , which generates an expansion of the amplitude in powers of @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) .",
    "charm loops , and other hadronic contributions , are thus approximated as effective interactions that are local on the soft scales set by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this simplifies the computation substantially .",
    "in fact , to leading order in the ope the hadronic contribution reduces to a standard form - factor term .",
    "this picture has been first discussed at lowest order in the ope in @xcite , where it was applied to the endpoint region of @xmath1 and @xmath24 . in @xcite",
    "the ope was considered in some detail , including a discussion of power corrections .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate the ope for the high-@xmath2 region of @xmath1 from the outset .",
    "although our approach is similar in spirit to the analysis of @xcite , the concrete implementation is different .",
    "we will also go beyond the estimates presented in @xcite in several ways .",
    "an important difference is that @xcite combines the ope with heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , whereas we prefer to work with @xmath25-quark fields in full qcd .",
    "the latter formulation has the advantage of a simplified operator basis , which makes the structure of power corrections and their evaluation considerably more transparent .",
    "we also retain the kinematical dependence on @xmath2 in the coefficient functions , rather than expanding it around @xmath26 .",
    "we further discuss the issue of quark - hadron duality , which appears relevant because of the existence of @xmath13 resonance structure in the @xmath2 region of interest .",
    "violations of duality are effects beyond any finite order in the ope . using a resonance model based on a proposal by shifman",
    ", we quantify for the first time the size of duality violations in the high-@xmath2 region of @xmath1 .",
    "further aspects and new results of our analysis will be summarized in sections 8 and 9 .",
    "the main conclusion is that @xmath1 is under very good theoretical control also for @xmath17 .",
    "precise predictions can be obtained in terms of the standard form factors , with essentially negligible effects from the additional hadronic parameters related to power corrections and duality violation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 collects basic expressions for later reference . in section 3 our formulation of the ope for @xmath1 at high @xmath2",
    "is described and the power expansion is constructed explicitly , complete to second order in @xmath27 and with a discussion of weak annihilation as an example of a ( small ) third - order correction . in section 4 we present an estimate of the matrix elements of higher - dimensional operators and quantify their impact on the decay amplitudes for both @xmath28 and @xmath29 transitions .",
    "section 5 discusses the connection between the ope for large @xmath2 and qcd factorization for energetic kaons , which are shown to give consistent results at intermediate @xmath30 . in section 6",
    "we address the subject of duality violation in the context of a toy model analysis .",
    "the estimate is then adapted to the case of @xmath31 in section 7 . in this section",
    "we also address conceptual aspects relevant for the existence of the ope and the notion of quark - hadron duality .",
    "a comparison of our approach with the literature is given in section 8 before we conclude in section 9 .",
    "details on the basis of operators in the ope are described in appendix a and some numerical input is collected in appendix b.",

    "the sign conventions for the electromagnetic and strong couplings correspond to the covariant derivative @xmath41 . with these definitions",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 are negative in the standard model .",

    "the coefficient @xmath52 of the operator @xmath53 is determined by very short distances @xmath54 and is precisely known .",

    "the amplitudes for the exclusive decays @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , or a similar meson , are given by the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian in ( [ heff ] ) between the initial @xmath0 meson and the @xmath59 final state .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the semileptonic operators @xmath40 .",
    "their matrix elements are simple in the sense that all hadronic physics is described by a set of @xmath60 transition form factors .",
    "this is also true for the electromagnetic operator @xmath61 .",
    "the matrix elements of the hadronic operators @xmath62 are more complicated .",
    "they are induced by photon exchange and can be expressed through the matrix element of a correlator between the hadronic part of the effective hamiltonian @xmath63 and the electromagnetic current of the quarks @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the electric charge quantum number of quark flavour @xmath66 and a summation over @xmath66 is understood .",

    "can be performed for the non - local term @xmath75 which describes the contribution of 4-quark operators to the @xmath32 amplitude .",
    "such an ope corresponds to integrating out the hard quark loop , leading to a series of local effective interactions for the high-@xmath2 region . to leading order in the large-@xmath2 expansion",
    "this has been presented in @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the ope including higher - order contributions has been given in @xcite .    before going into more detail we discuss the basic structure of the ope for @xmath76 .",
    "the expansion may be written as @xmath77 the operators @xmath78 are composed of quark and gluon fields and have the flavour quantum numbers of @xmath79 .",
    "they are ordered according to their dimension @xmath80 and carry an index @xmath81 labeling different operators with the same dimension .",
    "the @xmath82 are the corresponding wilson coefficients , which can be computed in perturbation theory .",
    "the large scales justifying the expansion are @xmath83 and @xmath2 .",
    "they are counted as quantities of the same order .",
    "the coefficients then scale as @xmath84 in the heavy - quark limit . since the matrix elements @xmath85 scale as @xmath86 , the matrix element of each term in ( [ khco ] ) behaves as @xmath87 .",
    "current conservation implies that all operators are transverse in @xmath66 , @xmath88    it is convenient to work with the @xmath25-quark field in full qcd .",
    "this field could be further expanded within heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , in order to make the @xmath89-dependence fully explicit .",
    "in such an approach many additional operators would arise whose hadronic matrix elements are not readily known .",
    "in contrast , the advantage of using the @xmath25-field in full qcd is that fewer operators appear and that the matrix elements of the leading ones are given by common form factors . in this method",
    "the ope becomes particularly transparent and we will adopt it here .    at leading order in the ope ( @xmath90 ) , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kh3 ] ,    and in the chiral limit ( @xmath91 ) there are two operators @xmath92 using the equations of motion for the external quarks it can be shown that all possible bilinears @xmath93 and @xmath94 arising from the correlator @xmath76 can be expressed in terms of ( [ o31 ] ) and ( [ o32 ] ) .",
    "consequently , no independent dimension-4 operators of the form @xmath94 can appear in the ope .",
    "the complete proof is given in appendix a. as an example , the operator @xmath95 satisfies the equations - of - motion identity ( for @xmath91 ) @xmath96 for any @xmath97 matrix element with momentum transfer @xmath66 this is equivalent to @xmath98 because of current conservation only the transverse part @xmath99 of such an operator @xmath100 can appear in the ope . from ( [ sdbq ] ) we see that this part can be reduced to a linear combination of ( [ o31 ] ) and ( [ o32 ] ) .",
    "if we keep @xmath101 , two additional operators have to be considered @xmath102 since @xmath103 is small , and numerically similar to @xmath104 , we may formally count these as operators of dimension 4 . because they are absent at order @xmath105",
    ", their impact will be suppressed to the level of @xmath106 , which is negligible .",
    "note that these operators do in any case not introduce new hadronic form factors .    at @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kh5 ] )    we encounter operators with a factor of the gluon field strength @xmath108 , which have the form @xmath109 where the @xmath110 denote dirac and lorentz structures .",
    "we will treat the ope explicitly to the level of @xmath107 , that is including power corrections up to second order in @xmath104 .",
    "although we will not give a full treatment of dimension-6 corrections , we consider as an example the effect of weak annihilation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kh6 ] ) .",
    "this contribution is characterized by the annihilation of the two valence quarks in the @xmath111 meson in the @xmath112 transition through the weak hamiltonian .",
    "it is described by 4-quark operators , which read schematically @xmath113 with lorentz and dirac structures indicated by @xmath114 , and the light quark field @xmath115 , @xmath80 in the case of non - strange @xmath111 mesons .",
    "weak annihilation provides a mechanism to break isospin symmetry , directly at the level of the transition operator . in @xmath76 weak annihilation , in addition to being a third order power correction , comes only from qcd penguin operators , which have small coefficients . the contribution to isospin breaking from this source",
    "will therefore be strongly suppressed .      in this section",

    ", it has been shown that the convergence of the series is very good .",
    "we therefore use the mathematica input files provided by the authors of @xcite in the online preprint publication for a numerical estimate .",
    "we find that the non - factorizable @xmath117 corrections to the charm loop lead to a 10 - 15% reduction of the real part of @xmath139 and contribute a negative imaginary part of again 10 - 15% relative to the short - distance contribution from @xmath123 ( the precise value is scheme - dependent ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the effect found for the _ inclusive _ @xmath140 rate in the high-@xmath2 region , as discussed in @xcite , and is similar to the effect observed for the low-@xmath2 region in the exclusive decay modes , see table  5 in @xcite .",
    "it is to be stressed that these corrections almost compensate the factorizable charm - loop contribution ( diagram on the l.h.s . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kh3 ] ) .",
    "the reason why the @xmath117 corrections are not suppressed stems from the different colour structure of the diagrams .",
    "whereas the factorizable charm loop comes with a colour - suppressed combination of wilson coefficients , the additional gluon exchange allows the @xmath13-pair to be in a colour - octet state with no such suppression . at",
    "even higher orders in perturbation theory , @xmath141 with @xmath142 , on the other hand , the numerical effect on @xmath139 should really be small , as no new additionally enhanced colour structures will arise .",
    "the computation of the amplitude from the ope requires the evaluation of the matrix elements of the local operators .",

    "more relevant than the detailed shape of the spectrum is the rate integrated over the entire high-@xmath2 region , which is best described in a model - independent way by the ope , as mentioned above .",
    "we rather employ the model to get an indication of the duality violating effects , which are not captured in an ope calculation .",
    "for this purpose the shifman model for the current correlator is adapted to the charm - quark case @xmath392 , with a choice of parameters consistent with the basic features of the most recent experimental data from bes .",
    "note that the krger - sehgal ansatz for @xmath392 @xcite , consisting of a spectral function with a finite number of resonances and a flat continuum for large @xmath2 , contains no information on duality violation .",

    "in addition , we extend the ope to include second - order power corrections , which we estimate quantitatively . a list of new results is given in the conclusions .",
    "here we would like to comment further on two conceptual differences between @xcite and our formulation .",
    "this concerns , first , the construction of operators in the ope and , second , the treatment of charm quarks .",
    "the operators in our approach are built from @xmath25-quark fields in full qcd rather than using hqet .",
    "this is convenient because the operator basis is simpler and the ope becomes particularly transparent .",
    "another advantage is that the matrix elements of the leading operators are given by the usual form factors in full qcd . unlike in a hqet framework ,",
    "not all dependence on @xmath89 is made explicit , but this is not essential from a practical point of view and still allows the consistent inclusion of power corrections to a given order in the expansion .",
    "this approach has been used for instance in the ope for inclusive @xmath0 decays applied to the computation of the lifetime difference of @xmath422 mesons @xcite .",
    "these investigations included power corrections @xcite as well as corrections of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in @xcite a matching onto hqet operators is performed from the start .",
    "this leads to a proliferation of operators , whose matrix elements are not given by the usual form factors .",
    "in fact , to reach a simplification of the resulting hqet expressions , the authors of @xcite partly undo the matching , from hqet back to full qcd expressions .",
    "we prefer to employ the full - qcd formulation throughout , in view of the advantages mentioned above .",
    "we next turn to the second point , the treatment of charm .",
    "the authors of @xcite perform an explicit expansion in @xmath423 , which corresponds to assuming the hierarchy @xmath424 .",
    "this implies that the charm quark is not integrated out at the scale @xmath425 and continues to be an active field below this scale .",
    "operators with charm - quark fields are then present in the ope",
    ".    we will argue that it is conceptually simpler to integrate out charm immediately at the scale @xmath89 , assuming a hierarchy @xmath426 , and that this can be done without any loss in accuracy .",
    "charm - quark effects are then entirely contained in the coefficients of the operators , as is apparent from the formulation of the ope given in section 3 .    to illustrate the point we consider the following example .",
    "let us take the scenario where @xmath424 . in this case",
    "the operator coefficients should be evaluated with @xmath138 .",
    "on the other hand , additional operators involving charm would have to be included in the ope . with explicit @xmath13 fields ,",
    "such operators arise at dimension 6 or higher .",
    "for instance , radiating the virtual photon from the two charm lines in the effective hamiltonian ( [ hcnopeng ] ) and leaving all four quark lines open , gives the dimension-6 operator @xmath427     \\ , ( \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl } c_1 + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj } c_2)\\ ] ] in analogy to ( [ kh6 ] ) .",
    "this operator has @xmath428 matrix elements contributing to the decay amplitude . assuming next that @xmath429 , the contribution ( [ kh6c ] ) can be simplified by integrating out the charm fields in a further step .",
    "contracting the charm lines into a loop , to which a gluon field is attached , induces below @xmath351 the dimension-6 operator @xmath430 the coefficient of this operator reproduces the logarithmic @xmath351-dependence at this order in the ope .",
    "a similar discussion has been presented in @xcite , illustrating how the logarithmic term @xmath431 in the coefficient of the leading dimension-3 operator ( [ kh3 ] ) is recovered in an effective theory with four - quark operators of the type @xmath10 . whereas the latter effect vanishes for @xmath324",
    ", we note that the coefficient in ( [ kh6d ] ) has a logarithmic divergence in this limit .",
    "this is of no consequence if @xmath429 , where @xmath351 still represents a hard scale .",
    "in fact , for higher - dimensional operators generated by ( [ kh6c ] ) , that is operators with more factors of the gluon field and its derivatives , the coefficients will scale as inverse powers of @xmath351 .",
    "a similar situation exists for inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , where four - quark operators with charm , analogous to ( [ kh6c ] ) , also appear at third order in the ope for @xmath424 .",
    "the effect of the corresponding charm loops has been refered to as intrinsic charm in @xcite , where the issue was discussed in great detail .",
    "the above consideration indicates how the nonperturbative @xmath433 matrix element of operators such as ( [ kh6c ] ) can be treated in an expansion in @xmath434 .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite for semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , the same effects are also described in a framework where charm is integrated out at the @xmath89 scale .",
    "no active charm fields need to be considered in this case and ( [ kh6c ] ) is absent from the ope .",
    "a difference between the ope with or without active charm is that the framework with charm fields and with a strong hierachy @xmath424 assumed , would offer the possibility of efficiently resumming logarithmic terms @xmath435 . since such logarithms are",
    "not very large and in view of the additional power suppression of such terms , such resummations appear not to be necessary in practice .",
    "we also stress that effects such as ( [ kh6c ] ) , irrespective of their detailed treatment , are suppressed at least as @xmath436 .",
    "small differences in the method of their calculation are therefore hardly relevant . we thus conclude that integrating out charm at the scale @xmath89 is entirely justified .",
    "the ope is then constructed in a single step and with a simpler operator basis . for these reasons",
    "the approach appears preferable and we have adopted it here .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath437 , @xmath438 , has the general form given in ( [ abmll ] ) .",
    "it contains the component @xmath439 @xmath440 which receives a nonlocal , hadronic contribution @xmath441 from the matrix element of the nonleptonic weak hamiltonian @xmath366 in addition to the semileptonic form factor terms ( @xmath442 ) .",
    "although the hadronic part @xmath443 is relatively small numerically outside the narrow - resonance region ( @xmath444 of @xmath445 ) , it needs to be reliably computed in order to achieve very accurate predictions .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the hadronic contribution in the region of large dilepton invariant mass @xmath17 , based on an operator product expansion in inverse powers of the hard scale @xmath200 . working with @xmath25-quark fields in full qcd and factorizing the dependence on @xmath89 , @xmath200 and @xmath351 into the coefficient functions , we obtain the following results :    * to leading order in the ope and to all orders in @xmath116 , @xmath446 is expressed in terms of the standard form factors parametrizing the matrix elements @xmath447 and @xmath448 of dimension-3 operators , up to coefficients calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath116 only @xmath447 is present . * in the chiral limit ( @xmath91 ) , the first power corrections appear only at second order ( @xmath449 ) and are governed by dimension-5 operators with a gluon field of the form @xmath450 .",
    "the corrections are computed explicitly , using the limit @xmath175 for the hadronic matrix elements , and are shown to be smaller than @xmath173 for @xmath445 . * for @xmath101 the dimension-4 operators @xmath451 and @xmath452 , with right - handed strange quarks , can arise in the ope .",
    "because they are absent at order @xmath105 , their contribution will be suppressed to the negligible level of @xmath106 . besides , no new form factors will be introduced by these operators . * within the ope framework the effect of weak annihilation is a natural ingredient , which we have briefly discussed , mainly for illustration . since in addition to being a third - order power correction it comes with small wilson coefficients , its numerical impact of a few permille is entirely negligible .",
    "* we have clarified the relationship between the ope at high @xmath2 and qcd factorization at low @xmath2 by showing that both descriptions yield consistent results at intermediate values of @xmath30 . *",
    "a relevant topic at high @xmath2 is the issue of quark - hadron duality , which is closely related to the existence of an ope .",
    "we have defined the ope with the help of a spurion momentum that allows for an independent scaling of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath453 and kaon energy .",
    "this allows one to clarify the analytic structure of the matrix elements of the correlator ( [ khconcl ] ) .",
    "we then employed a model based on an infinite series of charm resonances to estimate quantitatively the amount of duality violation , resulting in about @xmath329 for the rate integrated over the high-@xmath2 region .",
    "an important aspect is the different sensitivity to duality violation of the contributions to the rate linear or quadratic in @xmath443 .",
    "the quadratic term is more vulnerable to duality violation , but numerically suppressed as a term of second order in the small charm - loop contribution .",
    "the systematics of duality have further been studied in a toy model for the rare decays , in which the factorization of the charm loop is exact .",
    "the main conclusion is that the high-@xmath2 region of @xmath1 is theoretically under excellent control .",
    "decay rates and distributions are perturbatively calculable up to the nonperturbative effects accounted for by the standard form factors in full qcd .",
    "further nonperturbative corrections are strongly suppressed and negligible within the accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the existence of the ope implies that at high @xmath2 the theory of @xmath1 has an even more solid basis than at low @xmath2 .",
    "an example for applications is the combined analysis of @xmath31 and @xmath454 @xcite . here",
    "the form factor dependence can be essentially eliminated , which leads to precision observables sensitive to new physics effects @xcite . beyond @xmath1 ,",
    "the results of our analysis apply to the high-@xmath2 region of exclusive rare decays with similar final states such as @xmath24 , @xmath455 and , with appropriate modifications , to @xmath456 or @xmath457 .",
    "we show that the ope of @xmath76 in ( [ khdef ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath458 at the level of dimension-3 and dimension-4 operators in full qcd , in the chiral limit @xmath91 . for @xmath101 , @xmath459",
    ", right - handed strange quarks can also appear , together with a suppression factor of @xmath103 .",
    "this leads to the two additional operators @xmath460 and @xmath461 in ( [ o41 ] ) and ( [ o42 ] ) , which can be counted as operators of dimension 4 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath460 and @xmath461 between @xmath111 and @xmath464 are all given by the standard @xmath428 form factors .",
    "together this implies that at leading ( dimension 3 ) and next - to - leading order ( dimension 4 ) in the ope , and to all orders in @xmath116 , standard form factors are the only hadronic matrix elements required .",
    "corrections to these terms arise only at second order ( @xmath465 ) in the ope through operators of dimension 5 . in other words",
    ", there are no first - order power corrections ( @xmath466 ) in the ope of @xmath76 , except for the purely kinematical dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath83 in the coefficient functions .",
    "these functions contain first - order terms such as @xmath467 , which however are calculable and do not introduce unknown hadronic matrix elements .",
    "we demonstrate the completeness of the basis @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath460 and @xmath461 for operators of dimension 3 and 4 by enumerating all possibilities consistent with the relevant symmetries , and using the equations of motion .",
    "we first assume @xmath91 .",
    "operators of dimension 3 built from @xmath468 and @xmath25 have the form @xmath469 where lorentz indices can be contracted with the metric @xmath470 , the @xmath471-tensor and factors of @xmath66 to yield a 4-vector with index @xmath472 .",
    "useful relations are @xmath473 which holds for @xmath474 matrix elements , and @xmath475 or similar identities .",
    "exactly three structures can be formed : @xmath476 this can be seen as follows . for @xmath477 in ( [ opdim3 ] )",
    "the only possibility is the third operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .",
    "for @xmath478 we obtain the first operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) and @xmath479 which is equivalent to the third term in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .",
    "for @xmath480 we can write the second operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .",
    "in addition , we could form @xmath481 which leads back to the same structure .",
    "this exhausts the possibilities and proves the completeness of the basis in ( [ opdim3b ] ) at the dimension-3 level .",
    "we next consider operators of dimension 4 .",
    "these have , in addition to the fields in ( [ opdim3 ] ) , one covariant derivative acting on the strange quark .",
    "their general form is @xmath482 because of @xmath483 terms with extra covariant derivatives acting on @xmath25 do not lead to independent dimension-4 operators and may be disregarded .    for @xmath477 in ( [ opdim4 ] ) we can write the operator @xmath484 . using the identity in ( [ sdbq ] )",
    "this operator can be expressed in terms of the basis in ( [ opdim3b ] ) : @xmath485 the other possible structure can be reduced as @xmath486    for @xmath478 the dimension-4 operator has the form @xmath487 we list the possible contractions of ( [ sdgamb ] ) into a 4-vector together with the reduction to the basis in ( [ opdim3b ] ) , neglecting operators of dimension 5 . @xmath488 the r.h.s . of ( [ gammac ] )",
    "is reduced to the basic operators via ( [ sdbop3 ] ) .",
    "the terms on the r.h.s . of ( [ gammad ] )",
    "lead back to the expressions ( [ gammac ] ) and ( [ gammab ] ) .",
    "for @xmath480 the dimension-4 operator becomes @xmath489 we list again the possible contractions and their reduction to the operators in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .",
    "@xmath490 the r.h.s . of ( [ sigmaa ] )",
    "is given by ( [ sdbop3 ] ) .",
    "the r.h.s . of ( [ sigmab ] ) is equivalent to ( [ gammab ] ) and ( [ oneqq ] ) , and ( [ sigmac ] ) reduces to ( [ sigmaa ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof that all operators of dimension 3 and 4 , ( [ opdim3 ] ) and ( [ opdim4 ] ) , can be expressed in terms of ( [ opdim3b ] ) for @xmath91 .",
    "taking current conservation into account leaves us with @xmath462 and @xmath463 in ( [ o31o32 ] ) .",
    "similar arguments hold if @xmath468 is replaced by @xmath491 . since right - handed strange quarks come with a factor @xmath492 , the two further operators @xmath460 and @xmath461 in ( [ o41 ] ) and ( [ o42 ] ) are obtained for @xmath101 .    similarly to the derivations above it",
    "can be shown that dimension-5 operators of the form @xmath493 , contracted to a lorentz vector with index @xmath472 , can always be reduced to linear combinations of ( [ opdim3b ] ) and operators containing a factor of the gluon field strength @xmath147 . the former terms correspond to dimension-3 operators with a purely kinematic power suppression .",
    "genuine operators of dimension 5 therefore have the form @xmath494 , as quoted in ( [ o5n ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we collect input we have used in numerical calculations .",
    "the numbers quoted are our central values .",
