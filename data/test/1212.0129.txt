    "dark energy ( de ) is one of the most attractive and active fields in modern cosmology due to the indications of accelerated expansion of the universe through type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "observational data like cmbr @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , gravitational lensing surveys @xcite and galaxy redshift surveys @xcite also favor this phenomenon .",
    "however , the identity of de is still ambiguous and various models have been suggested to know its nature .",
    "its simplest candidate is the cosmological constant but it suffers two well - known problems , i.e. , `` fine tuning problem '' and `` cosmic coincidence problem '' @xcite .    in order to understand the nature of de phenomenon , various dynamical de models have been proposed which can be characterized by the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the holographic dark energy ( hde ) is one of the emergent dynamical de model proposed in the context of fundamental principle of quantum gravity , so called holographic principle @xcite .",
    "it is derived with the help of entropy - area relation of thermodynamics of black hole horizons in general relativity which is also known as the bekenstein - hawking entropy bound , i.e. , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the maximum entropy of the system of length @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the reduced planck mass . using this relation , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite argued that the vacuum energy ( or the quantum zero - point energy ) of a system with size @xmath3 should always remain less than the mass of a black hole with the same size due to the formation of black hole in quantum field theory .",
    "hsu @xcite and li @xcite formulated this statement in mathematical form as @xmath5 which is known as hde density , @xmath6 is constant , @xmath3 is the infrared ( ir ) cutoff and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the density of hde describes the connectivity between ultraviolet ( uv ) and ir cutoffs which represent the bounds of energy density and size of the universe , respectively .",
    "the hde model suffers the choice of ir cutoff problem .",
    "li @xcite proved that hubble as well as particle horizons are not compatible with the present status of the universe while the future event horizon is the best candidate for non - interacting hde with suitable parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it is argued @xcite that hde with future event horizon plagued with causality problem ( why should we calculate the current value of de density with the help of future event horizon of the universe@xmath8 ) .",
    "this problem motivated people @xcite-@xcite to modify the ir cutoff as a function of the ricci scalar or generalized form of the ricci scalar .",
    "further , observational analysis has also been done for these types of hde models @xcite .",
    "the stability against small perturbations is a well - known procedure to check the viability of a de model . for this purpose",
    ", the sign of the square of the speed of sound , @xmath9 , plays a key role - its negativity represents instability and vice versa @xcite .",

    "the scalar - field dark energy model then can be considered as an effective description of this holographic theory .",
    "the reconstruction of hde in terms of scalar fields has been discussed widely .",
    "the scalar fields ( which naturally occur in particle physics such as string theory @xcite ) are used as a possible candidate of de . in this scenario ,",
    "a large number of models have been proposed including quintessence , phantom , k - essence , tachyon , ghost condensates and dilatonic de @xcite etc .",

    "recently , sheykhi @xcite has constructed the quintessence , tachyon , k - essence and dilatonic de scalar field models for interacting hde with hubble horizon as an ir cutoff in flat universe .",
    "the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) was also discussed for hde model with different ir cutoff for non - flat universe @xcite .",
    "it is believed that an early inflation era provides a flat universe , but this consequence is only true if the number of e - foldings is very large @xcite .",
    "the data of first year wmap analysis favors the non - flat scenario of the universe @xcite . also , different observational data provided the evidence about the contribution of spatial curvature to the total energy density of the universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the parameterizations of the dark energy models admit the non - flat universe by implying compatible observational data @xcite . recently ,",
    "@xcite have used type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , cmbr and observational hubble data and obtained the value @xmath12 for fractional energy density due to curvature .",
    "it would be interesting to study the universe with a spatial curvature .    in view of above discussion , we extend the work of sheykhi @xcite by taking the generalized form of ir cutoff of hde in non - flat universe .",
    "we also check the validity of the gslt in this scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section * 2 * contains the discussion of the evolution and instability of interacting nhde in non - flat universe .",
    "section * 3 * is devoted for the reconstruction of scalar field models of interacting nhde while section * 4 * investigates the validity of gslt .",
