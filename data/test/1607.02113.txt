    "the dynamics of nonlinear systems is largely nontrivial and numerical simulations , involving sophisticated mathematical techniques , usually need to be made to fully understand their temporal evolution .",
    "the situation is even more complicated in spatially extended systems , like in nonlinear optics , in which ( multi)dimensional variables are present in the dynamics . in these cases an analytical ( or semi - analytical ) approach that allows us to gain physical insight about",
    "the system is only possible if we consider universal models @xcite , which formally capture the dynamics of nonlinear systems close to critical points ( like the threshold of emission in a laser ) .",
    "these models , also known as order parameter equations ( ope ) provide a simplified yet powerful description of the system .",
    "their universal character is due to the fact that very different systems ( biological , chemical , physical , etc . )",
    "are described by the same ope , the only difference being in the meaning of variables and parameters under this approach .",
    "the symmetries of the system play a central role in the final form of the ope , those equations are able to capture qualitatively the essential elements of the dynamics .",
    "these ope can be real or complex depending on the fundamental variable ( electric field , temperature ) that is considered .",
    "in nonlinear optics , complex ope are commonly used since a complex ginzburg landau ( cgle ) for lasers for finite positive detuning was derived @xcite and have proven being very helpful for understanding a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "another equation , a complex swift - hohenberg ( cshe ) , which is valid for small detunings ( positive and negative ) was later obtained @xcite .",
    "one fundamental symmetry for complex ope describing spatially extended nonlinear systems is the phase symmetry , as it determines the nature of patterns which are possible in them . in systems with continuous phase symmetry , the dynamics is usually turbulent and the presence of vortices and spiral waves is common . when the systems only allows a finite number of phases ( by means a @xmath0 forcing @xcite for instance ) the dynamics become more ordered and controllable . furthermore , when a @xmath1 ( parametric ) forcing is applied to a systems with continuous phase symmetry , the dynamics of the system allows only two phases in it , which leads to the appearance of novel structures in the system like phase domains , domain walls and localized structures ( cavity solitons ) . the proper ope for the system must reflect this change and a generic equation can be derived for systems with @xmath0 forcing @xcite . for parametric forcing a family of ope , like the parametric complex ginzburg landau ( pcgle )",
    "@xcite are obtained .    optical systems ( like lasers )",
    "are usually insensitive to parametric forcing as the nonlinear response of these systems to high frequencies ( twice the natural frequency ) is negligible . in the last years a novel technique involving a new kind of forcing , known as `` rocking '' , was introduced @xcite .",
    "this is a @xmath2 forcing ( the frequency of the injection is close to the frequency of the system ) so it is appropriate for optical systems .",
    "the key factor is that the injection oscillates in time ( temporal rocking ) @xcite or space ( spatial rocking ) @xcite with a given frequency .",
    "this modulation modifies the dynamics of the system which becomes phase bistable .",
    "it can be shown that a pcgle describes the universal dynamics of a laser close to threshold under rocking when the undriven system exhibits an homogeneous hopf bifurcation .",
    "rocking has been successfully applied ( theoretically and experimentally ) to a wide range of systems @xcite .",
    "this has led to the derivation of opes describing those systems under certain limits and that provide relevant information of the dynamics .",
    "numerical simulations also prove that the behaviour predicted by these opes extends ( qualitatively ) far beyond the conditions imposed in their derivation , which increases the utility of this universal description .",
    "a complex swift - hohenberg equation with parametric gain , which describes a photorefractive oscillator ( pro ) under the injection of rocking was derived in @xcite .",
    "here we show that a very similar equation describes lasers with small detuning when rocking forcing is present , as well as we generalize the result of  @xcite to more general setups .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the equation which is object of our study and obtain their homogeneous solutions . in section iii a linear stability analysis is performed to both trivial and homogeneous solutions to study instabilities against perturbations of wavevector @xmath3 . in section",
    "iv we present some numerical simulations of our model for different values of parameters and show the patterns that can be found .",
    "we conclude in section v. in the appendices we present the derivation of the equation for lasers and pro and a comparison with the real swift - hohenberg equation .",
    "we consider the spatio - temporal dynamics of extended systems close to a bifurcation to traveling waves of long wavelength , when the system is forced in time close to its natural frequency ( 1:1 resonance ) and uniformly in space . however the type of forcing considered here is not the classic periodic one but has an amplitude which varies on time , specifically whose sign alternates periodically in time .",
    "the kind of forcing which we refer to can be thus expressed as:@xmath4 where @xmath5 is a @xmath6-periodic function of time of period @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a high frequency , almost resonant with the natural frequency of the undriven system .",
    "a simple realization of @xmath9 is the function:@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is an amplitude .  according to ( [ forcing ] ) and ( [ periodic ] ) the forcing phase ( sign ) alternates in time .",
    "as shown in the appendices , where two relevant optical systems are analyzed under the action of such forcing , the state of the system can be expressed as:@xmath13 where @xmath14 is a @xmath6-periodic , spatially uniform contribution merely following the forcing , plus a spatially 2-dimensional field @xmath15 whose dynamics is governed by the following parametrically driven swift - hohenberg equation ( written in dimensionless form):@xmath16 the first line of this equation contains the usual complex swift - hohenberg equation , which models pattern formation arising from a finite wave number instability to traveling waves close to threshold @xcite , whereas in the second line we find the additional terms which appear when rocking is considered @xcite .",
    "the first extra term , @xmath17 , merely moves the reference frame to the central frequency of the rocking @xmath8 ( see appendices ) .",
    "the last extra term , @xmath18 , is the actual novelty as it breaks the phase invariance of the system , which becomes phase bistable as the equation only has the discrete symmetry @xmath19 . as for the parameters ,",
    "@xmath20 measures the distance from threshold ( it can be removed from the equation by simple scaling but we keep it not to overwhelm the notation ) , @xmath21 controls the nonlinear frequency shift of the system , @xmath22 controls diffraction / dispersion .",
    "other parameters are @xmath23 , the detuning of the cavity from the natural frequency of the unforced system in the optical case , and @xmath24 , which is the detuning of the forcing from the natural frequency of the system .",
    "finally the `` rocking parameter '' @xmath25 is proportional to the squared amplitude of rocking @xmath26 and also depends on its frequency @xmath27 in a way whose exact form depends on the system considered ( see appendices ) ; note that when @xmath28 the effect of rocking is lost and ( [ swe1 ] ) becomes a usual complex swift - hohenberg equation .    in the following we",
    "will take @xmath29 as to not increase the degrees of freedom of the problem without need and also because in the analyzed cases that parameter happens to be zero . on the other hand @xmath30 in the pro case , while @xmath31 in the case of laser",
    "the spatially uniform nontrivial solutions of ( [ swe1 ] ) , or `` rocked states '' , can be expressed as @xmath32 where :    @xmath33       the state @xmath34 is always unstable as follows from a standard linear stability analysis , so we will not consider it in the following . on the other hand as @xmath35 can take two values ( differing by @xmath36 ) this produces two phase - locked states ( with same amplitude ) and phase differing by @xmath36 ( bistable phase locking ) . from now on",

    "[ ptb ]    fig3modi.jpg    [ ptb ]    fig4.jpg    the analysis for negative @xmath23 is richer , as expected , because in this regime the swift - hohenberg equation ( [ swe1 ] ) without rocking ( @xmath28 ) already displays traveling waves of wavenumber @xmath72 ) . for large positive @xmath24",
    "we still have a hopf bifurcation connecting trivial and traveling wave solutions ( for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) . for negative , and small positive @xmath24 ( @xmath76 ) the trivial solution destabilizes to a pattern with leading wavenumber @xmath71 at a certain @xmath77 .",
    "additionally , for small @xmath25 we have traveling waves as in the previous case . regarding the rocked states ,",
    "these are destabilized in two ways : ( i ) through a complex eigenvalue with most unstable wavevector @xmath75 , which happens symmetrically around @xmath24 ( see fig .",
