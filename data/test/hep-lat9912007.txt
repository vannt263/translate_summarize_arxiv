    "in recent large - scale simulations of lattice qcd , statistical errors of physical quantities have become quite small .",
    "indeed , for some hadronic matrix elements the precision has been so high that we can not ignore uncertainties coming from the renormalization factor of lattice operators .",
    "thus it has become increasingly important to reduce uncertainties from this source .",
    "renormalization factors can be evaluated in perturbation theory . pushing the calculation beyond the one - loop level",
    "is usually difficult , however , hence uncertainties arising from higher - order corrections remain .",
    "we expect this problem of higher - order uncertainties to profit fully from a non - perturbative treatment .",
    "a non - perturbative method for calculating renormalization factors was proposed@xcite , and has been applied to the quark mass@xcite , decay constants@xcite and four - fermion operators@xcite , with the wilson and the clover quark actions and to the quark mass with the kogut - susskind quark action@xcite .    an important point to check with",
    "non - perturbatively calculated renormalization factors is their reliability and the degree of improvement achieved in the final physical results . for this purpose",
    "the pion decay constant is perhaps the best choice because the reference experimental value is known to a high precision .",
    "a verification that non - perturbative determination works for simple quark bilinear operators is a first step to ensure validity of more general applications to four - quark or other operators .    in this work , the pion decay constant",
    "is examined with the kogut - susskind ( ks ) quark action via gauge invariant and non - invariant operators using all ks flavors .",
    "the ks action has the well - known feature that @xmath5 flavor symmetry is broken down to @xmath6 subgroup at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "we orient our study mainly toward the following two points provided by this feature .",
    "first , due to the remaining @xmath6 symmetry , the renormalization constant for the corresponding axial vector current equals exactly unity , and hence the pion decay constant calculated in this channel receives no renormalization .",
    "this makes it possible to attain a high - precision calculation of the pion decay constant without uncertainties from renormalization .",
    "second , we can calculate the pion decay constant using axial vector currents in the other ks flavor channels .",
    "symmetry is broken in the decay constants at a finite lattice spacing , but restoration is expected in the continuum limit . such restoration of full flavor symmetry has been previously examined for pion mass@xcite . here",
    "we extend the study to the pion decay constant , the new feature being the necessity of renormalization constants .",
    "this can be used to investigate the reliability of non - perturbative methods for the calculation of renormalization factors , compared to perturbative treatments .",

    "the pion decay constants obtained for eight irreducible representations again form a degeneracy pattern , which , however , is different from that for pion masses .",

    "<S> we present a study for the pion decay constant @xmath0 in the quenched approximation to lattice qcd with the kogut - susskind ( ks ) quark action , with the emphasis given to the renormalization problems . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations are carried out at the couplings @xmath1 and 6.2 on @xmath2 and @xmath3 lattices , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the pion decay constant is evaluated for all ks flavors via gauge invariant and non - invariant axial vector currents with the renormalization constants calculated by both non - perturbative method and perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath4 mev in the continuum limit as the best value using the partially conserved axial vector current , which requires no renormalization . from a study for the other ks flavors we find that the results obtained with the non - perturbative renormalization constants are well convergent among the ks flavors in the continuum limit , confirming restoration of @xmath5 flavor symmetry , while perturbative renormalization still leaves an apparent flavor breaking effect even in the continuum limit . </S>"
