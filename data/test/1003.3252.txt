    "observations have shown that massive spheroids at high redshift are remarkably smaller than their local counterparts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this population of galaxies must evolve into local massive ellipticals based on their stellar masses , however it is not yet clear what the primary mechanism is which increases their sizes by a factor of four to match the local galaxy population .",
    "although various effects ( i.e. dry major mergers , observational biases , selection effects , see for instance @xcite ) may explain the observed size evolution of these systems , a physically motivated favoured mechanism is the growth in size by later minor mergers with less dense galaxies @xcite .",
    "this scenario has the advantage in that it facilities the growth in galaxy sizes while permitting a mild evolution in velocity dispersion as observed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an additional problem is understanding how these objects first formed . an emerging picture ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the formation of these compact systems predicts that massive , gas - rich galaxies at very high redshift become unstable following a major merger event , triggering a short - lived starburst within @xmath4gyr .",
    "theoretical models @xcite have shown that the size of the remnant strongly depends upon the degree of dissipation involved , being very small in the case of strongly dissipative mergers . since at high redshift ( @xmath5 )",
    "galaxies are more gas - rich than they are today @xcite , the degree of dissipation is expected to be high , and the resulting remnant extremely compact , with sizes @xmath6 kpc .    given the great amount of gas involved in these star formation processes , we expect the progenitors of massive compact galaxies to be undergoing a high amount of star formation , and hence should be detectable in the subm - mm @xcite . to tests",
    "this hypothesis we examine in this paper a sample of smgs ( sub - mm galaxies ) , which have been imaged with hst in deep exposures , to probe their structural properties .",
    "smgs are among the most luminous ( @xmath7 ) , and rapidly star forming ( @xmath8 ) galaxies in the high - redshift universe @xcite and are believed to be the precursors of local early - type galaxies @xcite . as their local counterparts , the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , the origin for their high fluxes is thought to be a strong starburst and/or agn activity , likely triggered by a major merger @xcite .",
    "it is also plausible that many sub - mm galaxies are similar to the hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hlirgs , @xmath9 , @xcite ) , containing a similar amount of molecular gas , and an extreme star formation rate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the similarity between the stellar mass surface densities of smgs and the compact massive galaxies at lower redshifts @xcite makes sub - mm galaxies natural candidates for being the precursors of these compact galaxies . this paper tests this hypothesis and investigates whether the proposed theoretical scenario for the formation of massive compact galaxies is compatible with present deep imaging and star formation analysis of these sub - mm systems . to explore this",
    ", we probe the sizes of the smgs in various phases , which we construct based on morphology and structure , and test whether the star formation rates of these galaxies are in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "second , we probe whether the different observed morphologies of the smgs can be fitted into the evolutionary sequence proposed by current massive galaxies formation models",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    our target selection is based on the following criteria , needed to characterize the nature of our high redshift sub - mm galaxies : ( i ) very deep images ( particularly with acs on the hubble space telescope ) to detect signatures of interactions ; ( ii ) systems within and similar to the redshift range where the massive compact galaxies have been detected ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , ideally based on spectroscopic redshifts ; ( iii ) our smgs should be massive ( @xmath14 ) to ensure that these objects are indeed the progenitors of the lower redshift massive galaxy population .    for the above reasons",
    "the number of smgs that we can explore is limited .",
    "we adopt as our parent sample the smgs from @xcite .",
    "this paper contains spectroscopic redshifts ( from @xcite ) , multi - wavelength photometric data - points collected from the literature , including spitzer observations .",
    "this allows for the determination of accurate sfrs and stellar masses for 76 massive smgs ( see @xcite for these values and the details in how they were calculated ) .",
    "the resulting range of stellar mass is quite small : @xmath15 . for these reasons",
    "this sample of sub - mm galaxies are the progenitors of a fraction of local massive ellipticals , as well as the compact galaxies at high redshift .",

    "the original stellar masses from this catalogue are converted from a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) to a kroupa imf @xcite .",
    "our new analysis is based on deep archival hst acs and nicmos images of these sources , where we find images for 12 sources in the goods north field .",
    "we also investigated sources in other fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but these have too shallow observations to be useful for our purposes 7000s compared to the @xmath16 27000s for the goods - n imaging ] .",
    "our final collection of images is as follows : we have acs images in the f850lp filter ( z - band ) for all 12 objects , and nicmos nic-3 data from the goods nicmos survey ( gns ; @xcite ; conselice et al .",
    "2010 in preparation ) in the f160w filter ( h - band ) for 6 objects .",
    "the z - band data , at 5 orbits depth , reaching a magnitude limit of z=27 mag ( 15@xmath17 ) , have been drizzled to a scale of 0.03  with a point spread function ( psf ) full width at half - maximum of 0.1  .",
    "the nicmos images , at 3 orbits depth ( limiting magnitude of h=26.8 mag , 5@xmath17 ) , were combined to produce images with a pixel scale of 0.1  and psf size of 0.3  .",
    "note that at @xmath18 the acs data trace the near - uv rest - frame , whereas the nicmos imaging shows the b - band rest - frame .",
    "the nicmos and acs images of the final sample are shown in figure [ nic ] and [ acs ] , respectively .",
    "all the objects in our sample show hints of agn activity either from optical spectral features , or from x - ray and radio detections . however , it is unlikely that these agn dominate the bolometric emissivity in such objects .",
    "the reason for this is that all the seds are well - fit by pure star forming models , without the need of an agn contribution @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of these sub - mm galaxies further confirm that they are starburst dominated without a bolometrically significant agn @xcite .",
    "moreover , as shown by @xcite , the x - ray to far - ir luminosity ratio is much lower than that found in qsos , indicating that the contribution of the agn to the total luminosity can not be higher than 10% .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that the x - ray emission in smg is largely due to star formation activity and , even in the cases where the presence of agn is confirmed , it is not the dominant contributor to the bolometric luminosity , except in rare cases",
    ". therefore we expect that the properties of our sub - mm selected galaxies are not biased by agn activity .",
    "morphological parameters and sizes are measured on our sample through the two - dimensional fitting code galfit @xcite .",
    "we model the light distribution of the sources with a srsic profile , deriving the srsic index @xmath19 , the axis ratio @xmath20 and the semi - major effective radius @xmath21 in arcsecs .",
    "we scale the radius to the physical scale in kpc relative to the redshift of the source and we circularise it through @xmath22 . the robustness of galfit in recovering sizes and structural parameters using hst data was assessed in several previous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) , through the use of simulated galaxies , and is found to be robust at the resolution and depth of our hst imaging .    to check the reliability of our measurements against changes in the psf shape along the images we use up to five different natural stars , as found in our fields , as psfs .",
    "we measure the structural parameters for each objects five times , taking as our final measurement the biweight estimator , and its confidence interval as the uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "most of the sources have an uncertainty of @xmath23 in the measured size and @xmath24 in the srsic index . only two cases",
    "( smmj123606.72 + 621550.7 and smmj123632.61 + 620800.1 ) contain large errors based on the acs imaging analysis , as their effective radii are close to the size of the psf .    in the nicmos images ,",
    "the most uncertain measures are found for the compact source smmj123632.61 + 620800.1 , and for the merging system smmj123616.15 + 621513.7 , where the nicmos resolution does not resolve the three components seen in the acs observations . in most of the cases ,",
    "contaminating neighbours are present in the image , and we account for these by fitting the surface brightness profile of these neighbours together with the target object .",
    "as shown by @xcite the simultaneous fit allows one to recover structural parameters more reliably than deriving them using masks .",
    "likewise , in the case of mergers , the interacting systems are fit at the same time .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in table [ tab1 ] , where size , srsic index and axis ratio are shown for the acs and nicmos data .    by comparing sizes and srsic indices measured in different filters , we find that the two estimates for the isolated systems agree to within 3@xmath17 .",
    "the reason for the slight differences in these fits may be ascribed to the morphological k - correction , where different aspects of the stellar populations for these galaxies are observed at different wavelengths .",
    "this is particularly relevant within actively star forming galaxies or those with dust , such as the systems we examine in this paper .",
    "note that at the median redshift of our sample ( @xmath25 ) , the nicmos filter is probing the rest - frame optical , while the acs imaging matches the rest - frame nuv .",
    "hence the bluer acs band is more sensitive to the clumpy distribution of the star forming regions . particularly in the case of ` disc'-like galaxies , the srsic index measured in the nuv rest - frame is smaller compared to the rest - frame optical wavebands ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , in most of the cases the nuv and optical rest - frame morphologies agree in their ability to discriminate between disc - like ( @xmath26 ) and early - type ( @xmath27 ) galaxies .    on the other hand , for the merging systems the measurements in the nicmos and acs bands show significant differences .",
    "one reason for this is the lack of resolution in the nicmos band , which does not always allow us to resolve the merging systems , such as the case of smmj123616.15 + 621513.7 where three galaxies are seen in the z - band image , but only two in the h - band image .",
    "the system smmj123622.65 + 621629.7 is a rapidly ongoing merger which is seen in the rest - frame uv as a compact , elongated galaxy with prominent tidal features , while in the nicmos band the tides are not resolved , and the effective radius is much larger . in the case of system smmj123635.59 + 621424.1 the strong disagreement is due to the fact that in the z - band we observe a multicomponent system , made up of a compact bulge with a double nucleus , plus faint spiral arms on larger scales .",
    "since the spiral arms are too faint to be fit with a single srsic model we have measured the compactness of the bulge .",
    "rather , in the nicmos h - band the multicomponent structure is not resolved , and fits to the system reveal a much more extended profile .",
    "hence , merging systems can appear very different at different wavelengths when using images at different resolutions , and morphological k - corrections can strongly affect our measurements .",
    "in figure [ acs ] we show the acs images of the sample , classified according to their morphological properties .",
    "we find that smgs display a heterogeneous mix of morphologies .",
    "we divide the sample into three main categories : disc - like objects ( 5/12 ) , ongoing mergers ( 4/12 ) and compact galaxies ( 3/12 ) .",
    "the first class includes the majority of the sources ( 42%@xmath218% ) , which show quite regular and diffuse morphologies , light - profiles characteristic of late - type galaxies ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , and are very faint .",
    "although we can not rule out that some of them are interacting systems , where the companion is not detected due to its faintness at nuv wavelengths , our hypothesis is that these objects are disc - like galaxies with ongoing sfr .",
    "it is important to note that for galaxies in this category , where we have nicmos imaging , the disc - like nature is confirmed through the rest - frame optical images .    the second category , ongoing mergers ( 33%@xmath217% ) , are systems where two or more components are clearly visible in the acs band .",
    "we include in this class the source smmj123635.59 + 621424.1 , since a double nucleus is visible , and it is likely to be in the final stages of a merger .",
    "most of these interacting systems display disc - like structures with a large range in sizes .",
    "this is also confirmed in nicmos when data is available .",
    "the final class includes three ( 25%@xmath214% ) very compact , isolated sources .",
    "all of these objects show a concentrated light - profile , with srsic indices indicative of an early - type morphology ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 kpc .",
    "note that the extremely small sizes measured in the acs data ( tracing the nuv ) indicates that the star formation is extremely concentrated in the centre of these objects .",
    "although the agn contribution might play a role in shrinking the size measured in the rest - frame uv , we find that when nicmos data are available the near - ir sizes are slightly larger but still very small compared to galaxies with similar masses in the nearby universe .",
    "( red squares : disc - like galaxies , green circles : mergers , blue asterisks : compact galaxies ) .",
    "the open symbols with errorbars indicate the average ssfr for a given class .",
    "average and standard deviation have been computed with a bootstrap resampling .",
    "the x - axis refers to the position of the galaxy in the proposed evolutionary sequence shown in figure [ acs ] .",
    "the dashed line shows the predictions of @xcite from a merger model for smgs , with the time - scale shown in the upper axis in units of gyrs .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    in figure [ rm ] we plot the stellar mass - size relation for our sample galaxies , divided into the three morphological classes .",
    "overplotted is the mass - size relation for disc galaxies from @xcite at z=2.3 ( the median redshift of our sample ) :    @xmath29    with @xmath30 and @xmath31 for nicmos - derived sizes ( upper envelope of the shaded region ) and @xmath30 and @xmath32 for the acs - derived sizes ( lower envelope ) .",
    "the local relation , @xmath33 , is taken from @xcite based on sdss data .",
    "remarkably , the sizes of the disc - like galaxies in our sample match the sizes found for the general massive galaxy population at this redshift . as the relation of @xcite does not change significantly for acs and nicmos data , this reinforces the idea that the acs sizes of our disc - like objects ( around 2 - 3 kpc ) are representative of the rest - frame optical sizes of these galaxies .",
    "we note that some of the galaxies in our sample were already studied in previous works @xcite using both ground - based and hst data .",
    "they found a higher merger fraction ( @xmath34 ) with respect to ours ( @xmath35 ) , partly due to the method adopted for the classification of mergers . while the above authors use schemes based on the asymmetry parameter , in our analysis we only considered ongoing mergers those systems where two or more distinct components are resolved in the acs image . as mentioned above , it is also possible that dust is hiding the interacting structure , and we are missing a fraction of actual mergers , hence our measured merger fraction has to be considered a lower limit .",
    "motivated by high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , we argue that the three morphological classes outlined above could represent an evolutionary sequence , where the disc - like class represents a pre - merger phase followed by the major merger event , while the compact sources can be interpreted as the end - stages of the merger , caught during or just after the coalescence .",
    "numerical simulations naturally explain how the tidal forces involved in the interactions remove angular momentum from the systems , allowing the gas to fuel towards the centre . at this stage ,",
    "the gas is compressed into a very small volume , leading to surface densities of the order @xmath36 @xcite , close to that of molecular clouds . according to the kennicutt law ,",
    "the sfr in such conditions is extremely enhanced .",
    "since the dynamical time - scale that drives the collapse is similar to the star formation rate , the system rapidly exhausts its gas while it contracts @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that we observe such compact galaxies with high sfr .",
    "the models , indeed , predict a spheroidal - like morphology at the time of coalescence or just after , since the coalescence generally completes at about the same time as the gas first reaches the centre @xcite",
    ".    moreover , our findings that a fraction of the smgs have a compact morphology agrees with measurements of the gas distribution from co maps for many galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , these compact , highly star - forming systems are likely to be in the final phase of the merger , and are the transition link between starbursts and compact galaxies .    a peculiar case is represented by the system smmj123635.59 + 621424.1 .",
    "we classify it as a merger event , as it appears as a double - nucleus system .",
    "however , its effective radius and srsic index are characteristic of those for compact galaxies .",
    "it is likely that we are measuring the compactness of the bulge component , given the faintness of the outer light .",
    "this systems also shows faint signs of potential spiral structure over a scale of 5 kpc .",
    "the ssfr of this system is the highest in our sample , compatible with being near the peak in star formation during the coalescence phase .",
    "it is worth to note that this object has the highest infrared luminosity @xmath37 ( from @xcite ) of our sample , hence it can be considered a hlirg , supporting the picture where hlirgs are galaxies in their maximal star formation periods triggered by interactions .    in order to build an `` illustrative '' evolutionary sequence",
    ", we can order galaxies inside a given class according to the values of their ssfr . in figure [ ssfr ]",
    "we show as a dashed line , the evolution of the ssfr in a simulated galaxy merger , taken from @xcite .",
    "the simulation illustrates the evolution of the sfr in a major merger ( with mass ratio 1:1 ) for a @xmath38 dark matter halo .",
    "we have computed the ssfr taking the sfr of their figure 1 and dividing it by the final stellar mass ( @xmath39 , which is roughly the maximum stellar masses of our sample ) .",
    "the trend in ssfr shows a modest star formation rate in the pre - merger phase , in agreement with the value of our diffuse galaxies , followed by a steep rise during the starburst / merger , a peak in the coalescence phase , and then a rapid decline .",
    "the trend depicted by the simulations is matched by our data if we assume that the ssfr increases in the merging phase , and then declines for the compact galaxies .",
    "the peak is reached during the coalescence , as it is illustrated by the source smmj123635.59 + 621424.1 . in simulations",
    "the diffuse / isolated systems are not fuelled by a new gas reservoir , as in the case for merging systems , and they simply exhaust the cold gas available .",
    "hence their ssfr declines with time ( see @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "in the same plot , we have indicated by the coloured points the ssfr of our sample of smgs , with the number in the x - axis indicating the position in the evolutionary sequence ( in figure [ acs ] galaxies are ordered according to this sequence ) .",
    "note that we adopt the sfr derived from the ir luminosity from @xcite , using the @xcite relation to computed the star formation rate .",
    "the fact that we can put our galaxy sample in a ssfr - sequence that well matches that found in hydrodynamical simulations , strengthens the conclusion that the ( morphological ) evolutionary sequence described above , where large diffuse systems transform themselves in compact remnants passing through a major merger event , is likely the formation mechanism for these galaxies into compact systems seen at slightly lower redshifts .",
    "another piece of evidence supporting this theoretical merging scenario is the size of the progenitor discs we have found .",
    "theoretically these discs are expected to have effective radius of 2 - 3 kpc @xcite .",
    "this is in fact what our observations show .",
    "given the lack of nicmos imaging for most of the sources and the insufficient resolution in the near - ir , we were forced to use acs imaging to constrain our morphological sequence .",
    "to better test such picture high - sensitivity imaging in near - ir would be required , and this could be achieved only when wfc3 imaging will be available .",
    "summarising , our data can not reject the evolutionary picture depicted by theoretical models in which the precursors of the superdense galaxies are massive , gas - rich discs at @xmath40 , which evolve into compact remnants through dissipative major mergers .",
    "moreover , a cold gas accretion driven scenario for the formation of the compact massive galaxies , as the one proposed by @xcite perhaps can not be easily supported by our data , since in this case we would likely not observe such a large diversity of size and structure for these progenitors as we observe here .",
