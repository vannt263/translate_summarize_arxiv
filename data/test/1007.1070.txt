    "as one of the most promising candidates for qubits , spins in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted much attention in the last two decades .",
    "@xcite although much progress has been made in single - electron qds , an attractive alternative is to base the qubits on singlet - triplet ( st ) states in two - electron qds .",
    "@xcite this is mainly due to two important features of the st states .",
    "one is the zeeman - driven st transition with anti - crossing due to the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which enables coherent manipulation of spin states .",
    "@xcite the other one is the low st relaxation rate which makes the spin polarization remains for a sufficiently long time .  @xcite as the qds are either self - assembled ones sitting on the surface of the substrate or fabricated by confining electrons in quantum wells by electrodes , bulk phonons in the substrate play an important role . in low - temperature regime ,",
    "acoustic bulk phonons in conjunction with the soc serve as the main source of the st relaxation due to the suppression of the effect of the hyperfine interaction in the presence of large magnetic field .",
    "previous studies show that at the vicinity of the st anti - crossing , the relaxation rate is greatly suppressed due to the mismatch of the phonon emission wave length to the dot size .",
    "furthermore , the spin - up triplet states which couple to the singlet ground state through the soc has a much shorter lifetime compared to the other two triplet states due to the strong st mixing between them .",
    "@xcite    despite of these progress in two - electron qds , the complicated fabrication process makes them difficult to be scaled up , which limits their application from an industrial point of view .",
    "recently , self - assembled two - electron qds embedded in inas [ 111 ] nanowires were fabricated .",
    "@xcite the well - controlled growth process enables parallel production in massive number with similar properties , which makes these nanowire - based qds are more suitable for integration onto silicon and scaling up for large hierarchical systems .",
    "although similar zeeman - driven st transition has been obtained in nanowire - based two - electron inas qds ,  @xcite the st relaxation can be quite different due to the properties of the confined phonons in the nanowires .",
    "the nanowires are perpendicular to the substrate , making the bulk phonons in the substrate are less important than the confined phonons in nanowires .",
    "@xcite the regular structure of the nanowires results in the quasi - one - dimensional confined phonons , which lead to novel properties in optical absorption and transport for the nanowire - based qds .",
    "@xcite therefore , these confined phonons are expected to have a pronounced impact on the st relaxation , which has not been studied to the best of our knowledge . in this work",
    "we will investigate the st relaxation induced by the confined phonons .",
    "consider a two - electron elongate qd embedded in inas [ 111 ] cylindrical nanowire with radius @xmath0 in the presence of external magnetic field @xmath1 along the wire .",
    "we model the qd by an anisotropic harmonic potential @xmath2 ( corresponding to the effective dot length @xmath3 and dot diameter @xmath4 ) with @xmath5-axis along the wire .",
    "@xmath6 is the effective mass of the electron .",
    "the single - electron hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the zeeman splitting with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the @xmath9 factor of electron , bohr magneton and pauli matrix respectively .",
    "@xmath12 represents the soc term . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the rashba coupling which is dominant in inas nanowires which has the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the rashba coupling strength.@xcite we assume the dot diameter @xmath15 so that only the lowest electron subband in the radial direction is needed .",
    "we also assume the external magnetic field is weak enough so that its orbital effect can be neglected .",
    "the confined phonons are calculated with isotropic elastic continuum model which is widely used in the study of nanowires , carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite the nanowire is modeled as an infinite cylinder with the stress vanishing at the surface of the wire .",
    "the displacement field of the ions induced by the confined phonons can be expressed by the quantized form ( in cylindrical coordinate ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the volume of the nanowire and @xmath18 is the density . the eigenmodes @xmath19 and spectrum @xmath20 are calculated following refs .  .",
    "note the due to the boundary condition , generally speaking , the confined phonon modes have both longitude and transverse components .",
    "given the displacement field , both the deformation - potential coupling and the piezoelectric coupling can be calculated .",
    "the deformation - potential coupling is given by the divergence of the displacement field , which reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the deformation - potential coupling strength .",
    "note that only the longitude component of the confined phonon mode has contribution to the deformation - potential coupling .",
    "the piezoelectric coupling is given by  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the polarization induced by the displacement field and @xmath25 is the dielectric constant . for inas",
    "[ 111 ] nanowires with wurtzite structure , @xmath24 can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath26 \\bm{e}_z ,      \\label{eq : pz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the piezoelectric constants .",
    "note that due to the anisotropy of the polarization , the piezoelectric coupling can be more sensitive to the confined phonon mode than the deformation - potential coupling .    in the following discussion , we restrict to the dilatation modes [ which have angular momentum quantum number @xmath30 and angular component @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uph ] ) ] since only these modes can couple to the electrons in the qds in the lowest subband of radial direction .",
    "@xcite    for two - electron qds , the total hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the coulomb interaction between the two electrons .",
    "@xmath34 is the hamiltonian for the confined phonons and @xmath35 is the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the superscript `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' label the two electrons .    to construct the two - electron basis functions ,",
    "it is convenient to use the separation of variables in terms of the center of mass @xmath36 and the relative motion @xmath37 . as the coulomb interaction is too strong",
    ", we choose the basis function as the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath38 without soc and zeeman term , which can be solved numerically by finite difference method in real space .",
    "the basis functions have the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the spin states of the two electrons , which can be expressed as @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) , @xmath42/@xmath43 is the wave function for the lowest subband in radial direction and @xmath44/@xmath45 is the wave function in axial direction .",
    "the subscript `` @xmath0 '' and `` @xmath46 '' label the center of mass and relative motion respectively . to guarantee the anti - symmetric of the wave function ,",
    "the singlet state @xmath47 always corresponds to @xmath45 with even parity , while the triplet states @xmath48 correspond to @xmath45 with odd parity .",
    "the energy levels and eigenstates of the two electrons can be obtained by diagonalizing the full two - electron hamiltonian @xmath49 in these basis .",
    "we identify an eigenstate as singlet and/or triplet by its expectation value @xmath50 .    treating @xmath51 and @xmath52 as the initial and final states",
    ", we can calculate the phonon - induced relaxation rate using fermi s golden rule .",
    "at zero temperature , the relaxation rate induced by the confined phonons reads  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy splitting and @xmath55 is the step function .",
    "@xmath56 comes from the total electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian @xmath57 , with @xmath58 for the deformation - potential coupling and @xmath59 for the piezoelectric coupling .",
    "the corresponding coefficients are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 are given in detail in appendix .",
    "note that the relaxation rate induced by bulk phonons can be expressed with similar equation as eq .",
    "( [ eq : srt ] ) , the main difference is that since the constant - energy surface is continuous for bulk phonons , the discrete summation over @xmath63 should be replaced by the integration over wave vector @xmath64 .",
    "before we represent the results , we would like to briefly summarize the three mechanisms which is crucial for the st relaxation .",
    "the first one is the st mixing .",
    "the st relaxation favors strong st mixing where the soc couples the states more efficiently .",
    "the second one is the ratio between the phonon emission wave length and the qd size .",
    "the phonon emission efficiency is maximized as the two length is comparable to each other , leading to large relaxation rate .",
    "the third one is the phonon density of states ( dos ) at the phonon emission energy , which is equal to the st energy splitting .",
    "larger dos implies that more phonons can be emitted , which enhances the st relaxation .",
    "the first two mechanisms manifest themselves in @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : srt ] ) , which is known as the form factor . the third one , e.g. , the phonon dos , is closely related to the quantity @xmath66 , which is very sensitive to the phonon spectrum .",
    "thus this one is expected to lead to pronounced differences in the st relaxation induced by confined phonons and bulk phonons .",
    "in the numerical calculation , we use the parameters for the inas [ 111 ] wurtzite nanowires .  @xcite the deformation - potential strength @xmath22 is chosen to be @xmath67  ev , the density is @xmath68  kg / m@xmath69 , the static dielectric constant @xmath25 is @xmath70 , the longitude and transverse sound velocities are chosen to be @xmath71  m / s and @xmath72  m / s respectively .",
    "@xcite since the piezoelectric constant for wurtzite inas nanowire is largely missing , we use the constants calculated by transformation from zinc - blende value @xmath73 , which are @xmath74 , with @xmath75  v@xmath76 m .",
    "@xcite the @xmath9 factor is set to @xmath77 ,  @xcite and the rashba coupling constant @xmath14 is chosen to be @xmath78  ev@xmath79 m ( corresponding to the so length @xmath80 nm ) .",
    "@xcite we set the radius of the nanowire @xmath0 to @xmath81  nm .",
    "the effective qd diameter @xmath82 is set to @xmath83  nm . the dot length @xmath84 is set to @xmath85  nm .",
    "we employ the exact diagonalization method with the lowest 48 basis functions to converge the energy levels and st relaxation rates .",
    "@xcite the magnetic field dependence of the first four levels and the corresponding expectation value of @xmath86 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eb](a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "an anti - crossing at @xmath87  t can be identified in the energy levels .",
    "the expectation values @xmath88 show an crossing at the corresponding magnetic field , indicating a strong mixing between the singlet and spin up triplet state ( st mixing ) . as the orbital effect of the magnetic field",
    "is neglected , the levels show linear field dependence , which is different from the typical disk - shaped qds .",
    "@xcite we emphasis that the mixing between the singlet and triplet states in our elongate qds is more stronger than the qds studied before .",
    "@xcite this can be seen in the large level splitting , which is @xmath89  mev at the anti - crossing .",
    "this value is much larger than the typical value for disk - shaped gaas qds , which is usually a few @xmath90ev .",
    "the strong mixing is not only due to the strong soc in inas , but also due to the large coulomb interaction in the elongate qds , which can enhance the relative strength of soc .",
    "@xcite     @xmath91 external magnetic field @xmath1.,width=283 ]    we start our discussion with the st@xmath92 relaxation . the magnetic field dependence of the st@xmath92 relaxation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : srt_st+](a ) . it can be seen that the relaxation rates induced by bulk and confined phonons are very different from each other . for bulk phonons ,",
    "the relaxation rate varies smoothly as a function of magnetic field .",
    "a local minimum can be found at the anti - crossing .",
    "for the confined phonons , the relaxation rate exhibits multi - peaks as a function of magnetic field .",
    "the two `` sharp '' peaks located at @xmath93  t and @xmath94  t are actually two divergent peaks",
    ". moreover , the relaxation rate exhibits a local maximum at the anti - crossing in contrast to the local minimum for the bulk phonons .",
    "we attribute the multi - peak structure and the local maximum at the anti - crossing as the two main features of the st@xmath92 relaxation rate induced by confined phonons .",
    "the first feature , e.g. , the multi - peak structure of the relaxation rate , is a direct consequence of the large dos at the van hove singularities in the confined phonon dos . to see this",
    ", we plot the spectrum of the relevant confined phonon modes and the corresponding dos in fig .",
    "[ fig : srt_st+](b ) and ( c ) respectively . the st@xmath92 relaxation induced by the confined phonons via the deformation - potential coupling and the piezoelectric coupling",
    "are plotted as a function of energy splitting in fig .",
    "[ fig : srt_st+](d ) [ here we only plot the relaxation rate before the anti - crossing for clarification , the relaxation after the anti - crossing has similar behavior ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the peaks in the relaxation rate correspond to the van hove singularities in the dos , indicating the strong enhancement due to the large dos .",
    "the divergent peaks correspond to the van hove singularity with @xmath95 , while the non - divergent peaks are induced by the van hove singularity with @xmath96 .",
    "this is because as @xmath97 , the form factor tends to zero , which will suppress the relaxation rate .",
    "@xcite note that the form factor can also have zeros for @xmath95 , which results in the dips in the relaxation rate .",
    "there are two types of zeros .",
    "one is the zeros due to the axial component ( corresponding to common peaks for both the deformation - potential coupling and the piezoelectric coupling ) ,  @xcite the other one is the zeros due to the radial component , which induces different dips for different electron - phonon coupling mechanism .",
    "note that the deformation - potential coupling dominates the relaxation rate in most cases except in the energy region @xmath98 $ ]  mev .",
    "this is because in this region , the corresponding phonon mode tends to be transverse mode which decouples to the electrons via the deformation - potential coupling .",
    "@xcite    it can be seen for fig .",

    "the behavior of the relaxation rate is decided by the combined effect of the st mixing and the phonon emission efficiency .",
    "both mechanisms enhance the relaxation rate at the anti - crossing , resulting in the local maximum . for bulk phonons ,",
    "the dos is a quadratic function of the energy splitting , so the relaxation rate can be suppressed as energy splitting decreasing , resulting in the local minimum at the anti - crossing .",
    "note that the energy splitting @xmath99 here ( @xmath100  mev ) is much larger than the energy splitting in typical disk - shaped gaas qds , so the suppression of the relaxation rate due to the decreasing of the phonon emission efficiency is absent .",

    "note that the `` sharp '' peaks here ( the first , second and the fourth peaks ) are not divergent peaks since they correspond to the @xmath131 van hove singularities .",
    "they are `` sharp '' since the piezoelectric coupling has a large contribution at these peaks which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : srt_st-](d ) .",
    "this is because these peaks are axial mode as @xmath97 , which is favored by the piezoelectric coupling .",
    "@xcite also note that for bulk phonons , the decreasing of the phonon emission efficiency due to the small phonon wave length dominates in this region .",

    "in summary , we have investigate the st relaxation induced by the confined phonons in two - electron nanowire - based qds .",
    "we find that the behavior of the relaxation rate is dominated by the large dos at the vicinity of the van hove singularities , while in the region where the confined phonon dos is flat , the effect of the phonon emission efficiency and the st mixing are more pronounced .",
    "this results in the multi - peak structure of the st relaxation rate and the local maximum of st@xmath92 relaxation rate at the vicinity of the st@xmath92 anti - crossing .",
    "these features are very different from the previous results for disk - shaped qds , indicating the unique property of the confined phonons .",
    "the effect of the deformation - potential coupling and piezoelectric coupling are also discussed .",
    "we find that for inas [ 111 ] nanowire , the deformation - potential coupling dominates the relaxation in most cases except in the region where the longitude component of the confined phonons mode is suppressed .",
    "the piezoelectric coupling is also found to be important for axial confined phonon mode at @xmath97 .",

    "<S> the singlet - triplet relaxation in nanowire - based quantum dots induced by confined phonons is investigated theoretically . due to the quasi - one - dimensional nature of the confined phonons , the singlet - triplet relaxation rates exhibit multi - peaks as function of magnetic field and the relaxation rate between the singlet and the spin up triplet state </S>",
    "<S> is found to be enhanced at the vicinity of the singlet - triplet anti - crossing . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the effect of the deformation - potential coupling and the piezoelectric coupling and find that the deformation - potential coupling dominates the relaxation rates in most cases . </S>"
