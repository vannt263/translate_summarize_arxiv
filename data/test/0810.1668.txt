    "the vela - puppis region was first identified as a bright radio region by @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared , y and z ( the radio counterparts of the vela snr ) and remarked that is the most prominent radio feature , with the specific distinction of having an almost flat radio spectrum .",
    "a total radio energy spectrum of the form @xmath5 was measured by @xcite , which was based on flux measurements up to 8.4 ghz . however , between 8.4 and 30 ghz , @xcite resolved the filamentary and pwn structures and found that the spectra are overall harder : whereas the pwn spectrum is @xmath6 , the filamentary spectrum is of the form @xmath7 .",
    "following _ egret _ observations of the vela region , @xcite showed that the observation of inverse compton ( ic ) scattered he @xmath1-rays from the electron component producing this radio component , should allow us to constrain the maximum radio frequency and associated field strength .",
    "this electron component should ic scatter three target photon components : the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) field , the galactic far infrared radiation ( fir ) field as a result of reradiation of dust grains , and the local starlight field @xcite .",
    "further insight into the nature of was revealed by the detection of a cocoon of x - ray emission south of the vela pulsar by _ rosat _ @xcite . the x - ray data",
    "( with limited energy extent up to 2.4 kev ) was shown to be consistent with a thermal origin , but recently @xcite used _ xmm - newton _ observations of the southern head of this cocoon to show that the addition of a non - thermal synchrotron component with photon index as steep as @xmath8 is favoured by the data . by rescaling the _ h.e.s.s . _ flux relative to the _ xmm - newton _ fov , a field strength of @xmath4 g was found .",
    "@xcite also identified a bright radio filament running along this cocoon and models for such filaments require a strong thermal component , pulsar - generated magnetic flux and relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "conclusive proof for the existence of relativistic particles in the x - ray cocoon was revealed by _",
    "_ observations of the vela region @xcite .",
    "in fact , _ h.e.s.s . _ detected a spectral maximum from , which allows us to probe the low energy spectral component , as well as the energy at which the spectral turnover occurs .",
    "an overlay of the _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ image is shown in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite , showing the overlap of the vhe @xmath1-ray cocoon and the bright radio filament referred to by @xcite .",
    "whereas a hadronic interpretation was suggested by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite reviewed evidence in favour of a leptonic ic origin .",
    "recently @xcite also found that the thermal particle density at the head of the cocoon where bright vhe @xmath1-ray emission was found , is only 0.1 @xmath9 - a factor 6 lower than the lower limit employed by @xcite .",
    "this places more stringent constraints on the brightness of a hadronic signal from .",
    "@xcite derived an x - ray photon index of @xmath10 within a distance of 0.5 arcmin from the pulsar .",
    "this index represents the uncooled ( by synchrotron losses ) electron spectral index injected into the pwn , since a steepening is observed for distances greater than 0.5 arcmin .",
    "the corresponding uncooled post shocked electron spectral index of 2.0 is also consistent with the pre - break spectral index detected by _",
    "_ , if the signal from the latter has an inverse compton origin .",
    "@xcite has shown that most likely consists of a 2-component non - thermal spectrum : from fig .",
    "2 of @xcite the lepton spectrum corresponding to the vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum only connects to the radio lepton spectrum if the field strength of the radio structure is @xmath11 g , if we extrapolate the uncooled lepton index of 2.0 towards the radio domain .",
    "however , the field strength in the radio filaments is more likely to be in the range 10 to 50 @xmath12 g @xcite .",
    "the observation of an x - ray photon index @xmath13 in the cocoon by @xcite may be due to synchrotron cooling inside the x - ray band ( below 7 kev ) and to test this we need hard x - ray observations with a fov covering the full size of .",
    "only _ integral _ ( 20 - 300 kev ) has a large enough fov to cover the extended ( and by default cocoon ) region .",
    "however , only point - like unpulsed emission centered on the pulsar ( consistent with the 12 arcmin psf ) with a photon index of @xmath14 was detected by _ integral _ ( l. kuiper , personal communication , 2007 ) .",
    "thus , synchrotron burnoff must have terminated most emission above 20 kev at distances @xmath15 arcmin from the pulsar to levels consistent with the sensitivity of _ integral_.",
    "this spectrum is consistent with the _ osse _ spectrum reported by @xcite , covering at least the total cocoon region .",
    "beppo_sax pds , with a fov of @xmath16 ( fwhm ) , also observed the vela pulsar above 20 kev , covering most of the cocoon region @xcite .",
    "although the observed photon index of the nebula is slightly steeper ( @xmath17 ) , the energy flux is comparable to that of _",
    "integral_.    in this paper",
    "we construct a time dependent post shocked injection spectrum @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 the lepton energy ) .",
    "this spectrum consists of two components ( as motivated a above ) : @xmath20 as source for the extended radio emission and @xmath21 as source for the x - ray and vhe @xmath1-ray emission , confined mostly to the cocoon region . in this paper _ fermi lat _",
    "observations should be able to test the spectral connection between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these two distinct source spectra are normalised to the time averaged spindown power , giving conversion efficiencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 of spindown power to leptons .",
    "the time dependent transport equation with synchrotron losses is then solved to produce the present time electron spectra @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the field strength required for the synchrotron loss term is obtained from _",
    "_ observations , if we assume that the vhe @xmath1-ray signal is the result of ic scattering . since _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ measured the spectral energy maximum , we find the magnetic field strength which reproduces the observed multi - tev spectral break , so that @xmath27 is uniquely determined in the energy range 5 to 100 tev .",
    "we then show that this same @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 derived from the vhe spectral break ) also predicts the total hard x - ray flux from the pwn measured by _",
    "integral _ correctly within a factor two .",
    "for @xmath29 we also show that @xmath26 ( with the abovementioned @xmath28 ) reproduces the total integrated radio flux , which in turn predicts a high energy @xmath1-ray component , which can be tested with _ fermi lat_.",
    "in the discussion below we will neglect ( to a first order ) the effect of adiabatic cooling on the spectrum @xcite since the reverse shock ( applicable to ) is expected to have adiabatically heated the particles during the pwn crushing phase .",
    "energy losses due to adiabatic cooling during the pre - crushing phase is then partially cancelled during the crushing phase ( ferreira & de jager 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be the respective source spectra corresponding to the radio and x - ray synchrotron components , and @xmath30 be the time dependent spindown power , of which fractions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are converted to these two components .",
    "based on the discussion in section 1 , we model these source spectra as @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the two respective equations .",
    "these upper and lower limits are currently weakly constrained by observations .",
    "the radio spectral index of 0.39 requires a particle index of @xmath34 , whereas an x - ray ( vhe @xmath1-ray ) lepton spectral index of 2 would reproduce the uncooled photon spectral index of 1.5 . by requiring the total energy in each respective component to be a fraction @xmath29 and @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 ) of the spindown power , we can show that ( with the minimum electron energy for the radio component much smaller than the corresponding maximum ) @xmath37 neglecting adiabatic losses ( as discussed above ) , but including radiation losses with timescale @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the sum of the synchrotron and ic ( klein - nishina effects included ) energy loss rates , the transport equation can be solved to give the present day ( age @xmath40 ) total particle spectrum for each component @xmath41 as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath42 this expression effectively allows leptons to be accumulated over time @xmath40 in the nebula .",
    "the resulting spectrum @xmath43 is however modulated ( steepened ) at the high energy tail by radiation losses . since radiation losses are negligible for the radio component , the integral over the source term @xmath23 yields the change in rotational kinetic energy ( @xmath44 ) since birth , as shown by @xcite , so that ( for @xmath45 ) @xmath46 the term @xmath47 is the time averaged conversion efficiency .",
    "@xcite found that a pulsar birth period of @xmath48 to 50 ms is required to reproduce the observed ratio ( @xmath49 ) between the pwn and snr radius .",
    "the recently measured pulsar braking index @xmath50 @xcite implies an age between @xmath51 and 15 kyr given the abovementioned range for @xmath52 .",
    "this range of values ( or exact choice of braking index ) do not change our conclusions significantly .",
    "the lepton spectrum for the x - ray / vhe @xmath1-ray emission region ( mostly the cocoon region ) derived from eqn.([nx ] ) ( parameters in table 1 ) is constrained by the following information : an injection ( uncooled ) lepton spectral index of 2.0 as discussed in section  [ intro ] , the ic normalisation of the vhe cocoon spectrum as provided by _ h.e.s.s . _",
    "@xcite , the multi tev break energy observed by _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ , spindown from @xmath48 ms to the current period of 89 ms within time @xmath40 ( @xmath53 to 15 kyr ) , an implied time averaged conversion efficiency of @xmath54 , and a field strength of @xmath4 g to reproduce the observed vhe break energy .",
    "it is clear that this model ic spectrum agrees relatively well with _",
    "_ measurements ( fig",
    ". 1 - thick solid line at very high @xmath1-ray energies ) .",
    "the cmbr mostly contributes to this spectrum , whereas higher energy contributions from the galactic fir and starlight photon fields are suppressed due to klein nishina effects .",
    "however , in the next section we will see that the latter two radiation fields contribute significantly to the high energy ic @xmath1-ray counterpart of the radio spectrum , where the ic scattering is in the thomson limit .    the lepton spectrum of the cocoon , if self - consistent , should be able to predict the total x - ray spectrum from . from fig .",
    "1 it is clear that the model synchrotron spectrum shows a radiation break around 1 kev ( @xmath55 to @xmath56 hz ) and predicts the 20 - 300 kev _",
    "integral _ flux within a factor 2 , although with a steeper spectrum .",
    "the latter is expected to harden if we allow the field strength to increase towards the pulsar in a more sophisticated model incorporating a spatial dependence as well .",
    "to first order we assumed the same field strength ( @xmath57 g ) of the entire structure as found for the cocoon @xcite .",
    "this may not be the case , but by comparing _",
    "fermi lat _ with high frequency radio observations we should be able to measure the field strength in this extended structure if the high frequency ( radio ) cutoff or turnover can be independently determined . in this case",
    "synchrotron cooling is negligible and the steady state spectrum is given by eqn ( [ nr ] ) . to reproduce the absolute radio flux ( for a particle index of @xmath58 ) we had to assume efficiencies of @xmath59 and 0.45 corresponding to the assumed spectral cutoffs @xmath60 hz and @xmath61 hz respectively .",
    "the leptonic parameters corresponding to the latter cutoff is listed in table 1 under `` radio '' . from fig .",
    "1 it is clear that the maximum frequency should be @xmath62 hz .    while the lack of high - frequency radio measurements prohibits a clear constraint on the cutoff of this component , _ fermi lat _ observations can constrain the maximum of the spectral energy distribution of leptons in the radio nebula . as an example we employ cutoffs at the abovementioned two frequencies to calculate the corresponding expected high energy @xmath1-ray spectra .",
    "these predictions are shown as dashed lines in fig . 1 ( marked `` he @xmath1-ray ic '' ) .",
    "the hard lepton spectrum followed by an assumed cutoff at an electron energy @xmath63 should produce broad @xmath1-ray features at three energies : @xmath64 corresponding to the temperatures @xmath65k ( cmbr ) , 25k ( fir ) and @xmath66k to @xmath67k ( starlight ) .",
    "although these energy densities are comparable in the local neighbourhood @xcite , we investigate deviations at the location of vela x : the ( ivs ) of dark clouds and cometary globules centered on ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) with a radius of @xmath70 and annular rms width of @xmath71 is located at a distance @xmath72 pc @xcite . with a @xmath73 m",
    "iras ring flux of @xmath74mjy / sr we obtain a luminosity of @xmath75 erg / s , and assuming a distance of @xmath76 pc between the ivs center and vela x , we obtain an additional fir energy density of @xmath77 ev/@xmath78 at vela x , which is well below our assumed local averaged energy density .",
    "other potential target photon fields from the vela molecular ridge and gum nebula are located directly behind the vela pulsar @xcite so that the contribution from these local clouds would be severely suppressed by the head - on - tail effect of the ic process , since the @xmath79 term ( with @xmath80 small ) in the energy loss rate term is much less than unity .",
    "furthermore , fluctuations in the local distribution of stars can also produce deviations in the starlight energy density at vela x. to investigate this we extracted the _ hipparcos _ catalog of @xmath81 stars , of which @xmath82 have parallax measurements at the @xmath83 detection level .",
    "this subset was used to calculate the starlight energy density at any 3d field point within @xmath84 pc from earth . within @xmath85 pc from earth",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath86 ev/@xmath78 , consistent with @xcite , whereas a value of @xmath87 ev/@xmath78 is obtained for the vela pwn , with the error reflecting the uncertainty in the distance to the vela pulsar @xcite . this mean value ( 0.44 ev/@xmath78 )",
    "was used in fig . 1 , but assuming a mean temperature of 7500 k to account for the stellar types contributing to this excess .    whereas the _ fermi lat _ webpage ] only lists sensitivities for point sources , we scale the actual _ egret _ upper limits for the vela x extended source ( extracted from the unpulsed skymaps ) obtained by @xcite by a conservative factor of 30 downward to account for the improved _ fermi lat _ sensitivity in the same energy bands for an integration time of 1 year .",
    "the _ egret _",
    "integral flux upper limits and _ glast / fermi lat _ sensitivities are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that a pulsar birth period of @xmath88 ms ( to reproduce the observed ratio of pwn to snr radii ) , spinning down within 11 to 15 kyr to the present period of 89 ms while converting @xmath89 of its spindown power to leptons ( e@xmath90 ) in the pwn with a spectral index of 2 , would reproduce the observed _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ flux in the cocoon via the ic process . a nebular averaged field strength of @xmath4 g",
    "would also reproduce the observed tev spectral break , furthermore , this same spectrum predicts the _",
    "beppo_sax pds and _ integral _ total fluxes within a factor of two .",
    "assuming the same 5@xmath12 g field strength in the much larger @xmath2 radio nebula , we need to invoke a second e@xmath90 component with electron spectral index 1.78 and a much larger conversion efficiency @xmath91 to reproduce the observed total radio spectrum up to at least 8.9 mhz and possibly 30 mhz .",
    "this spectrum should cut off or steepen significantly to meet the less energetic cocoon spectrum .",
    "the implication of this second ( radio ) component is the prediction of an ic component at he @xmath1-rays covering the same @xmath2 area south of the pulsar .",
    "the visibility of this component in the he @xmath1-ray domain for _ fermi lat _ is further improved due to the existence of the local fir and starlight target photon fields , scattered by the highest energy leptons in this second component up to @xmath92 gev @xmath1-rays ( in the thomson limit ) where _ fermi lat _ has good sensitivity .",
    "if the electrons radiating the radio component are trapped in compressed regions ( e.g. filaments ) with field strength @xmath93 g , we would require fewer leptons and hence lower efficiency @xmath24 to reproduce the radio emission . a he @xmath1-ray flux measurement , or upper limit thereof ,",
    "will provide constraints on this field and hence @xmath24 .",
