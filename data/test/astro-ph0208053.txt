    "within a star cluster , massive objects segregate into the cluster core as they lose kinetic energies to the less massive objects during approach toward energy equipartition .",
    "the result is an increase of the number density of the massive objects in the core .",
    "this phenomenon of mass segregation has long been known ( spitzer 1969 ; binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 531 ) but has attracted new interests in recent years .",
    "the large number density induces successive mergers of those massive objects , which could lead to the formation of an exotic object such as a very massive black hole .",
    "the important parameter of mass segregation is its timescale . in order to explain an observation in terms of mass segregation",
    ", the timescale has to be less than the age of the star cluster .",
    "however , mass segregation has been studied only for specific cases using numerical methods , i.e. , fokker - planck , monte carlo , and @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "the exceptional analytical works that are available are those of spitzer ( 1969 ) and tremaine , ostriker , & spitzer ( 1975 ) .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) considered an isothermal cluster of uniform density and estimated the timescale of mass segregation as the timescale of energy equipartition between stars of different masses .",
    "this model is too idealized for a star cluster , which is not isothermal or of uniform density .",
    "tremaine et al .",
    "( 1975 ) studied a decaying circular motion of an object in the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "this is originally a model for a motion of a globular cluster around the center of a galaxy , and it is not a model for random motions of stars in a cluster .",
    "therefore , an analytical study of a more appropriate situation is desirable .",
    "we analytically study a two - component cluster , which consists of two masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . the major component is the less massive stars .",
    "their total mass @xmath5 dominates over the total mass @xmath6 of the more massive stars , @xmath7 . here",
    "the subscript 0 is used to indicate that the quantity is relevant to the major component .",
    "the cluster is spherically symmetric in all its properties and completely isotropic in the velocity space .",
    "since the timescale of mass segregation is expected to be less than the relaxation timescale ( spitzer 1969 ) , the star cluster is regarded as almost collisionless .",
    "the individual stars move almost freely in the mean potential .",
    "the gravitational encounters occur only in a stochastic manner .",
    "our study is accordingly based on the overall behaviors of the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the major and minor components .",
    "they are approximated by pdfs of completely collisionless systems .",
    "the minor - component pdf is from a parameterized family of steady - state pdfs for which the degree of mass segregation is allowed to change .",
    "the major - component pdf is kept the same (  2 ) .",
    "these pdfs are used to obtain the energy loss per unit time from the minor component due to encounters with the major component (  3 ) .",
    "the energy loss rate yields the rate of change of the minor - component pdf , which in turn yields the timescale of mass segregation (  4 , eq .",
    "[ [ eq26 ] ] ) .",
    "we compare our result with those for relevant timescales , including the pioneering work of spitzer ( 1969 ) .",
    "we also use our result to discuss the origin of a black hole with mass of @xmath0 found in a young star cluster of the starburst galaxy m82 (  5 ) .",
    "the major component , i.e. , the less massive stars , is assumed to follow plummer s model ( polytrope with @xmath8 ; binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 223 ) .",
    "this steady - state solution for a collisionless spherical system has a simple analytic form but well reproduces observations of some globular clusters .",
    "the pdf in the phase space is determined by two parameters , e.g. , the total mass @xmath5 and the core radius @xmath9 : @xmath10 with @xmath11 at @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the gravitational constant and @xmath14 is the velocity .",
    "the relative potential @xmath15 is a function of the radius @xmath16 and defined as the negative of the gravitational potential @xmath17 : @xmath18 the corresponding mass density @xmath19 is @xmath20 here the integral @xmath21 gives the total mass @xmath5 .",
    "the squared velocity dispersion @xmath22 is @xmath23    the minor component , i.e. , the more massive stars , is assumed to have no contribution to the gravitational field of the star cluster . then the gravitational field is determined solely by the relative potential @xmath15 of the major component .",
    "according to the jeans theorem for a steady - state collisionless spherical system ( binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 221 ) , any function of @xmath24 serves as the minor - component pdf .",
    "the pdf assumed in our study is from a function family that has a parameter @xmath25 : @xmath26 with @xmath27 at @xmath12 .",
    "the factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 are functions of @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "their numerical values are shown in table 1 and figure 1 . the corresponding mass density @xmath35 is @xmath36 with the total mass @xmath6 .",
    "the squared velocity dispersion @xmath37 is @xmath38 figure 2 shows the radial profiles of the mass density and squared velocity dispersion for @xmath34 , 10 , and 100 .",
    "the total energy @xmath39 is obtained by integrating @xmath40 over the entire volume : @xmath41 the factor @xmath42 is a function of @xmath30 defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 at @xmath34 .",
    "we define the initial state as @xmath45 so that the radial profile of mass density and the velocity dispersion are the same as those of the major component . with an increase of the @xmath30 value ,",
    "the mass density of the minor component becomes more centrally concentrated than that of the major component .",
    "simultaneously , the velocity dispersion of the minor component becomes smaller ( fig .",
    "these behaviors represent mass segregation .",
    "the radial profile of velocity dispersion of the minor component remains the same as that of the major component .",
    "this property is essential to establishing the final state of mass segregation where no net energy exchange exists between the two components (  3 ) .",
    "thus , with a single parameter @xmath25 , the function family @xmath46 provides the simplest model to trace the evolution of the minor component from the initial to final states of mass segregation . at an intermediate state , the minor - component pdf",
    "is set to be just one of the functions , @xmath47 , or a linear combination of them , @xmath48 with @xmath49 (  4 ) .",
    "consider a single object in the minor component , which loses kinetic energy due to gravitational encounters with objects in the major component .",
    "if the velocity of the single object is @xmath14 , the rate of change of kinetic energy per unit mass is obtained as @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( binney & tremaine 1987 , eq . [ 8 - 66 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath52 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "the cutoff factor @xmath53 is the ratio of the maximum and minimum impact parameters , @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is a typical relative velocity between objects in the cluster ( binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 511 ) , and @xmath58 is the total number of objects in the major component .",
    "we have assumed @xmath59 .    by multiplying equation ( [ eq12 ] ) by the minor - component pdf @xmath60 and integrating over the @xmath14 space",
    ", we obtain the rate of change of kinetic energy per unit volume of the minor component . for the pdf @xmath61 ,",
    "the result is @xmath62 the factor @xmath63 is a function of @xmath30 defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 at @xmath34 . by integrating equation ( [ eq14 ] ) over the entire volume",
    ", we obtain the rate of change of total energy @xmath66 of the minor component : @xmath67 the factor @xmath68 is a function of @xmath30 defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 at @xmath34 .",
    "recall that gravitational encounters in a star cluster are stochastic .",
    "the energy change rates ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) have been obtained as ensemble averages .",
    "they are not locally defined quantities .",
    "the energy change rate for the entire minor component ( [ eq16 ] ) has been obtained by assuming @xmath71 because the cluster contains many stars .",
    "the first and second integrals in equation ( [ eq12 ] ) represent heating and cooling by the major component , respectively .",
    "they yield the terms @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , in equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "when the two terms balance , the total energy of the minor component settles to an equilibrium , @xmath74 . hence the @xmath30 value corresponding to the final state of mass segregation is @xmath75 this relation does not imply equipartition of kinetic energies , @xmath76 ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq4 ] ] and [ [ eq9 ] ] ) , because the major component is kept to follow plummer s nonthermal model .",
    "the condition for energy equipartition in an equilibrium state is that each of the two components has a thermal velocity distribution ( chapman & cowling 1970 , p. 80 ) .",
    "a qualitatively consistent result for very large values of @xmath77 was obtained by chatterjee , hernquist , & loeb ( 2002 ) . at @xmath78 for a brownian motion of a single massive object that is in equilibrium with the background stars .",
    "their study is mathematically equivalent to ours because we have ignored encounters among objects in the minor component .",
    "the background stars were assumed to follow plummer s model as in our present study . ]",
    "by using the energy change rate @xmath79 in equation ( [ eq16 ] ) , we estimate the timescale of mass segregation @xmath80 .",
    "this timescale is defined in terms of the secular increase of the mass of the minor component , i.e. , the more massive stars , in the cluster core @xmath81 : @xmath82 with @xmath83 for @xmath47 .",
    "the factor @xmath84 is a function of @xmath30 defined as @xmath85 where @xmath86 at @xmath34 .    since it is not analytically determined how the minor - component pdf changes in the course of mass segregation , we study two extreme cases .",
    "the one is that the minor - component pdf is characterized by a single @xmath30 value , which increases from the initial value of 1 toward the final value @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath47 with @xmath34 at @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq20 ] ) , and ( [ eq21 ] ) yield @xmath90 , while equations ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) , and ( [ eq11 ] ) yield @xmath91 . then @xmath92 is obtained as @xmath93 . using their initial values , we obtain @xmath94 the numerical factor is about 0.3878 .",
    "the other extreme case is that the state @xmath34 evolves directly into the state @xmath95 .",
    "these two states serve as the bases for the minor - component pdf , i.e. , @xmath96 with @xmath97 at @xmath88 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the core mass @xmath81 and the total energy @xmath66 of the minor component are @xmath99 and @xmath100 here we have made approximations for the state @xmath95 taking account of the fact that the minor component is well concentrated in the core and has a negligible velocity dispersion . then @xmath92 is obtained as @xmath101 . using their initial values ,",
    "we obtain @xmath102 the numerical factor is about 0.6331 .",
    "the present case has a somewhat larger timescale than the previous case because the effective energy difference is somewhat larger , i.e. , @xmath103 while @xmath104 in the initial state",
    ".    mass segregation in a real star cluster is expected to be intermediate between the above two cases . according to fokker - planck and monte carlo simulations of early stages of mass segregation ( inagaki & wiyanto 1984 ; fregeau et al .",
    "2002 ) , the ratio of velocity dispersions @xmath105 averaged over the whole cluster does not change appreciably , while that averaged over the core alone approaches steadily to the final value .",
    "the reason is that gravitational encounters occur preferentially among stars on orbits that pass through the dense core .",
    "although this fact has been ignored in our present calculation , the behavior of @xmath105 would be reproduced if the minor - component pdf were a superposition of various states between those of @xmath34 and @xmath95 with the average @xmath30 value increasing with the time .",
    "equations ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) have the same dependence on physical quantities .",
    "the values of the numerical factors are also similar to each other and well approximated to be @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "thus the timescale of mass segregation is @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 correspond to the central mass density @xmath111 and central velocity dispersion @xmath112 of the major component , respectively ( eqs . [ [ eq3 ] ] and [ [ eq4 ] ] ) .",
    "the timescale of mass segregation is greater than the core crossing timescale .",
    "since the core radius is @xmath9 and the central velocity dispersion is @xmath113 , the core crossing timescale @xmath114 is @xmath115 then equation ( [ eq26 ] ) for the timescale of mass segregation @xmath80 is rewritten as @xmath116 }   \\tau _ { { \\rm cc } } \\gg \\tau _ { { \\rm cc}},\\ ] ] where we have assumed @xmath117@xmath118 and @xmath119@xmath120 as a practical situation . on the other hand , the timescale of mass segregation is less than the relaxation timescale @xmath121 of the major component , which is about @xmath122 times the crossing timescale @xmath123 ( binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 190 ) : @xmath124 these results justifies our assumption that the star cluster is almost collisionless and the major - component pdf remains the same during mass segregation .",
    "the timescale of mass segregation is close to the timescale of energy loss from the minor component , @xmath125 at @xmath126 . using equations ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath127 the dependence on physical quantities is the same as that of equation ( [ eq26 ] ) .",
    "this is because the energy loss from the minor component and the increase of its central concentration are of the same phenomenon .",
    "the numerical factor of equation ( [ eq30 ] ) is about 0.4832 , which happens to be in agreement with the numerical factor 2@xmath128 of equation ( [ eq26 ] ) . since this energy loss timescale is obtained without any assumption on the evolution of the minor - component pdf , it is a robust measure .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) considered an isothermal cluster of uniform density and estimated the timescale of mass segregation as the timescale of approach toward energy equipartition between the major and minor components , and @xmath129 to decrease by a factor of @xmath130 . ] which was about @xmath131 times the relaxation timescale @xmath121 of the major component . using equation ( [ eq29 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the corresponding timescale in our model cluster : @xmath132 if @xmath133 , this energy equipartition timescale is by definition equivalent to our energy loss timescale @xmath134 in equation ( [ eq30 ] ) .",
    "since the numerical factor is @xmath107 , the equation is rewritten as @xmath135 where we have replaced @xmath136 with @xmath3 . except for an unimportant difference in the argument of the logarithm , the timescales ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq32 ] ) have the same dependence on physical quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical factors are different .",
    "this difference is not serious because there is ambiguity in the definition of the relaxation timescale .",
    "our relaxation timescale ( [ eq29 ] ) is based on the core crossing timescale @xmath123 and might not be sufficiently large to yield the energy equipartition timescale for the whole cluster .",
    "overall , although spitzer ( 1969 ) considered a very idealized cluster , his timescale is expected to be valid for energy equipartition in a real star cluster at least as an order - of - magnitude estimation .",
    "this is also the case for mass segregation , which occurs during approach toward energy equipartition .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) also predicted that , if the total mass of the minor component is much less than that of the major component , @xmath137 , the two components eventually achieve energy equipartition , @xmath76 .",
    "his prediction has been confirmed at least for the cluster core by fokker - planck and monte carlo simulations ( inagaki & wiyanto 1984 ; watters , joshi , & rasio 2000 : fregeau et al .",
    "since it is required that both the major and minor components evolve to have thermal velocity distributions (  3 ) , the energy equipartition is achieved at @xmath138 .",
    "and @xmath129 is very small but still existent ( @xmath139% ; inagaki & wiyanto 1984 ; watters et al .",
    "the reason is that the velocity distributions do not become exactly thermal even in the cluster core . ]",
    "this is beyond the limit of our model ( @xmath140 , where the cluster is assumed to be almost collisionless .",
    "the major component is kept to follow plummer s nonthermal model and hence does not achieve energy equipartition with the minor component , regardless of the total mass ratio @xmath141 .",
    "this fact is not serious to our estimation of the timescale of mass segregation , which is less than the relaxation timescale @xmath121 and has been defined at the initial time of the evolution @xmath88 in equation ( [ eq19 ] ) .      if the central mass density @xmath111 and central velocity dispersion @xmath112 have values typical of globular clusters ( binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 26",
    ", see also p. 423",
    "for the cutoff factor @xmath53 ) , equation ( [ eq26 ] ) is written as @xmath142 here we have assumed @xmath133 and replaced @xmath143 with @xmath3 .",
    "if we instead use the typical values of the core radius @xmath9 and central velocity dispersion @xmath112 , both of which are observable quantities , equation ( [ eq26 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath144 thus mass segregation in a typical star cluster has the timescale @xmath145 of order @xmath146 yr .    the above timescale of mass segregation is used to discuss the origin of a very massive black hole found in the starburst galaxy m82 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; matsumoto et al . 2001",
    "; see also matsushita et al .",
    "2000 ) . at the 2  secondary peak ,",
    "i.e. , an active site of star formation , there is a source of compact x - ray emission .",
    "the observed strong variability implies that the source is an accreting black hole .",
    "the observed luminosity of @xmath147ergss@xmath128 implies that the mass is greater than @xmath148@xmath149 if the emission is isotropic and its luminosity is below the eddington limit .",
    "this black hole should have been formed via successive mergers of massive stars and black holes that had segregated into the core of a star cluster ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2000 ) . since the 2  secondary peak has a starburst age of about @xmath150yr ( satyapal et al .",
    "1997 ) , the mass segregation should have occurred well within this short duration .",
    "the timescales given in equations ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( [ eq34 ] ) are too long .",
    "we suspect that the star cluster is exceptionally dense and compact .",
    "for example , the young star cluster r136 in the large magellanic cloud has @xmath151pc@xmath152 , @xmath153kms@xmath128 , and @xmath154@xmath155pc ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ) , which yields @xmath156yr .",
    "in fact , only one black hole heavier than @xmath157 has been found among more than 100 young star clusters of m82 .",
    "the objects that had segregated into the cluster core should have merged in a runaway manner ( quinlan & shapiro 1989 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ; mouri & taniguchi 2002 ) because the merger probability is higher for more massive objects .",
