    "the well - known landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , which reduces the radiation emission from an ultrarelativistic electron in a medium due to multiple coulomb scattering , has been investigated extensively at both slac and cern .",
    "nevertheless , the question remains if the traditional approach of using migdal s theoretical formulation is adequate in the case of targets of low nuclear charge . since the lpm effect is routinely applied in codes used to interpret extended air showers which naturally occur in a low-@xmath0 medium , the answer to this question is important .",
    "there is reason to suspect a certain degree of inadequacy since migdal applied the thomas - fermi approach to determine the screening ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 22 ) ) , an approach that is inherently statistical and therefore inaccurate for atoms with few electrons , see e.g.  @xcite . as essentially all experiments are performed in the full - screening limit , the inaccuracy of the screening model might lead to imprecise answers .",
    "furthermore , the contribution from electrons may be influenced differently by the lpm effect than the nuclear contribution since a different range of momentum transfers are relevant and different screening parameters involved @xcite . and ,",
    "finally , seemingly unphysical kinks in the calculated spectra based on migdal s formulation appear when the migdal formula reaches the bethe - heitler ( bh ) level .",
    "numerous previous experiments have presented evidence for the lpm effect , see e.g.  @xcite , in particular the slac experiment performed with 8 and 25 gev electrons @xcite , and the experiments at energies up to 287 gev performed at cern @xcite .",
    "the present experiment was performed in the h4 beam line in the north experimental area of the super proton synchrotron with tertiary beams of electrons with energies of 20 and 178 gev .",
    "the 20 gev beam was chosen to investigate experimentally the kink in the radiation spectrum obtained from migdal s formula .",
    "the high energy was chosen to maximize the photon formation length , given by @xmath1 , associated to the emission of photons with energies in the sensitive range of the bismuth germanate ( bgo ) calorimeter used , while retaining an acceptable beam intensity .        a schematic drawing of the setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the electron beam was defined by the scintillator counters ` s1 ` , ` s2 ` , @xmath2 , where the latter is a 9 mm hole scintillator ( used as a veto ) .",
    "the beam chosen in this way is centered on the target , and , after having traversed this , the electrons are swept away by two dipole magnets , connected in series .",
    "this method of separation inevitably introduces synchrotron radiation ( sr ) , the implication of which will be discussed below . to be able to correct for the background ,",
    "an empty target run was performed .",
    "vacuum pipes were used when possible , to reduce background to a minimum in the 70 m long setup .",
    "the beam spot size at the calorimeter position was determined by scanning a wide scintillator counter in the vertical and horizontal direction in front of the bgo . from these measurements",
    "we find a gaussian beam with a standard deviation of @xmath3 .",
    "we can also use this to determine the beam divergence , since the size of the beam is limited by the hole scintillator .",
    "if it is assumed that the angle made by the direction of the particle and the beam axis is proportional to the distance of the particle from the axis , we calculate a beam divergence of around for particles just inside the hole scintillator .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous measurements with drift chambers @xcite .",
    "the emitted photons are detected by a bgo calorimeter which is described in section [ calorimeter ] .",
    "the electrons that only emit a low - energy photon will be detected by a lead glass ( lg ) calorimeter which is positioned next to and slightly downstream of the bgo detector .",
    "if the electrons have emitted a high - energy photon , the electrons are deflected into the vacuum pipe and not detected . to avoid events where electrons hit the bgo ,",
    "we have positioned a scintillator ( ` scv ` ) in front of the bgo .",
    "besides measuring the bgo signal we also measure the height of the signal just before an event .",
    "this is motivated in section [ calorimeter ] .",
    "the data was recorded using an event - based vme system making offline event - selection possible .",
    "the count rate was @xmath4 electron triggers @xmath5 per burst , with burst duration 9.7 s repeated every 44.4 s , for all targets .",
    "all targets consisted of layers of disc - shaped foils with a diameter of 25 mm ( except the carbon targets which had a square shape ) and different thickness @xmath6 .",
    "the number of layers @xmath7 in a target was selected such that the total target thickness @xmath8 would correspond as closely as possible to @xmath9 of tantalum which is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radiation length of the target .",
    "the choice of total thickness was a trade - off between obtaining an acceptable signal - to - background ratio and keeping multi - photon events at a minimum .",
    "the influence of the latter is already substantial at this thickness .",
    "e.g. for electrons , the bh yield is reduced by 15% for a total radiated energy of . keeping target thicknesses in units of @xmath11",
    "almost constant makes the contribution from multi - photon events similar in all spectra , as the correction  essentially a shape - function  should be a polynomial of the variable @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "all targets are listed in table .",
    "[ tab : targets ] .",
    "the reference target of aluminum was assembled from 80 discs , each of thickness and between the individual foils as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "since each individual al foil is significantly thinner than the multiple scattering length of the material , @xmath13 , this target performs essentially as single scatterers i.e.  in the bh regime and is a simple , good reference spectrum .",
    "the other reference target , tantalum , was chosen since several previous investigations of tantalum are in agreement with theory @xcite .",
    ".specifications of the targets used . from left",
    "to right the columns correspond to the material , the number of foils used , the atomic number of the material , the measured thickness of a single foil , the radiation length @xcite and the total target thickness in units of radiation length .",
    "notice that @xmath11 for carbon is scaled , since the measured density is significantly different from the tabulated density of pdg @xcite . [ cols=\">,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the main detector in the setup is the bgo calorimeter which is used to measure photons with energies from about to . in addition , a lead glass calorimeter was used to measure electrons with energies above 2 gev .",
    "the bgo detector has a cylindrical shape with and 200 mm length which corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "it is coupled to a photonics xp3330 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and preequipped with a scionix preamplifer .",
    "the detector has been calibrated with an extracted beam from the aarhus storage ring denmark ( astrid ) where electrons with energies from 100 mev to 580 mev are available .",
    "this has been done since it is not possible to get an electron beam with an energy below 10 gev in the north experimental area at cern .",
    "it was found that the energy deposit in the bgo was in good agreement with geant4 simulations in this energy regime ( see fig .  [ fig : bgo_cal_g4 ] ) and that the detector response was linear ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bgo_cal ] ) .",
    "the very high @xmath15 for the linear fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgo_cal ] is mainly caused by a slight non - linearity at energies below 200 mev and by not including the systematic errors which are difficult to quantify .",
    "a high - energy point at was measured earlier at cern with tagged electrons @xcite .",
    "this measurement showed that the calibration at low - energies could safely be extrapolated to multi - gev energies and combined with the astrid data , this shows that the detector response is linear in the energy regime from up to . at energies below 200 mev the mentioned slight non - linearity shifts the energies by up to 6 mev .",
    "this does affect the conclusions of this experiment which are not energy sensitive on such a small scale .",
    "the bgo spectrum for 580 mev electrons obtained from astrid compared to a geant4 simulation of the energy deposit in the bgo crystal . ]",
    "bgo calibration made at astrid with electrons from 100 mev to 580 mev and fitted with a linear function . ]",
    "despite the good linearity of the detector , there are several difficulties connected to the bgo detector . in the high - energy environment at cern",
    ", the detector will occasionally be hit by photons with more than 100 gev .",
    "these events are believed to saturate the pmt and affect the detector for a substantial amount of time after the event .",
    "we have therefore marked events occuring within @xmath16 and after a high - energy event .",
    "we have also measured the detector output just before the pulse .",
    "this can be used to ensure that the detector has reached its base level , before a new event occurs .",
    "early investigations of the detector led to the conclusion that the pmt should be run at a very low high voltage ( hv ) of 405 v to minimize saturation .",
    "this is significantly below the recommendations by the pmt supplier , 1140 v , based on calibrations with cs-137 giving 661 kev photons .",
    "nevertheless , our measurements show that this does not affect the linearity of the detector , which has been tested several times .",
    "we have tested the bgo detector in numerous ways , to find out if it is well - behaved with these non - standard settings .",
    "the goal is to investigate how a high - energy event affects the detector .",
    "we mimic this with a short light pulse from a diode , a laserdiode and an actual pulsed laser .",
    "since the pmt is glued onto the bgo crystal , it is not possible to disassemble the detector and shine light directly onto the photocathode of the pmt .",
    "however , it could be accessed from the back by removing an endcap ( photonics xp3330 are no longer available ) .",
    "we used a pulsed nanosecond laser to inject a light pulse into the detector .",
    "surprisingly , the response saturated at signal heights well below ones observed at cern .",
    "the cause of this is uncertain .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the laser only illuminates part of the photocathode , causing a smaller signal than if the full photocathode is illuminated .",
    "we have investigated how low - energy events occuring shortly after a saturation event are affected .",
    "this has been done with a second light pulse from a diode which is triggered by the laser .",
    "the delay between the laser pulse and the diode was varied from to and only a small effect was observed , with a reduction in the signal height of about @xmath17 when the delay was reduced from to .",
    "no effect was seen when the delay was reduced from to .",
    "since the affected data are flaged by the daq system , this effect can be removed from the data in the analysis .",
    "we have investigated the signal height as a function of the hv with a ambe source giving 4.439 mev photons .",
    "the spectrum measured at a hv of 480 v is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : ambe ] .",
    "one can see the pedestal at channel 85 , the 4.4 mev peak at channel 90 , and a broad muon peak around channel 163 .",
    "the muon peak is caused by cosmic muons that deposit up to 100 mev in the crystal .",
    "this peak is broad since the detector is cylindrical and the particles therefore traverse different thicknesses of material .",
    "the positions of the 4.4 mev peak , the muon peak , and the pedestal are shown as a function of the hv in fig .",

    "nevertheless , the observation of the ambe signal and the muon peak at low hv indicates that the detector is well - behaving , even when operating at a hv significantly below the recommended value .     the peak channel as a function of pmt hv for the 4.4 mev peak , the muon peak and the pedestal .",

    "to compare our measurements to theories we have to make monte carlo simulations , since our spectra are affected by multi - photon events , where more photons are emitted by the same electron and detected as one .",
    "such events are easily included in monte carlo simulations .",
    "full geant4 simulations of the background and of the background plus the reference target are shown with the corresponding data in fig .",
    "[ fig : g4sim ] . in this simulation",
    "we include the full geometry of the setup , use a gaussian beam divergence with @xmath23 , a gaussian beam distribution with @xmath24 and include a background according to our measurements . to find a good agreement between the simulations and the data",
    "we have added an extra background of @xmath25 which is probably caused by two beam control scintillators positioned @xmath26 upstream the targets ( not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) . in the simulation we store the energy deposit in the bgo , in the lead glass and in the veto scintillator placed in front of the bgo .",
    "we remove all events where more than is deposited in the veto scintillator and take into account that only 92% of the particle energy is deposited in the bgo .",
    "this fraction has been determined from simulations with mono - energetic beams .",
    "the simulation results for the background and the aluminium reference target are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g4sim ] . for the data we have applied a cut removing all events with a hit in the veto scintillator and all events within from a high - energy event .",
    "the simulations and the data agree very well above and for the low - energy rise below .",
    "the magnetic field of the two dipoles is which introduces sr with a critical energy of which is well below the low - energy rise . from simulations with and without the lg calorimeter",
    "it is clearly seen that the main cause of the low - energy rise is backsplash from the lg .",
    "this arises since events where only low - energy photons are emitted , are accompanied by a high - energy electron which is only deflected @xmath27 by the two dipoles at the position of the detectors .",
    "unfortunately , the amount of backsplash was not discovered during the experiment . in the intermediate energy region from to there is a dip in the radiation spectrum which is not well understood .",
    "several explanations for this dip have been tested , but all unsuccessful .",

    "see the text for more details . ]",
    "since it has not been possible to accurately reproduce the measured spectrum in the full energy range with the geant4 simulations ( although it is rather close ) , we have chosen another approach to simulate the radiation spectra , which is significantly simpler and more physical transparent .",
    "this method has been used in a previous experiment @xcite and only calculates the radiation emitted by the electron and does not track the particle through the setup .",
    "it includes a bh radiation background , sr from the magnets and radiation from the target .",
    "we ignore the energy loss of the electron , which can safely be done since we are only interested in events with a low energy loss .",
    "however , since we do not track the particle through the setup and therefore do not include the veto scintillator , we have to determine a detection efficiency .",
    "this was not neccessary for the geant4 simulations above .",
    "we assume that the efficiency can simply be modelled as a multiplicative factor which varies slightly with energy .",
    "we use the ratio of the radiation spectrum from the aluminium reference to the background to determine the amount of material in the background ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : backrefrat ] ) .",
    "we use these two , since both only include sr and bh radiation , which are well - known . by taking the ratio between the two measurements",
    ", we remove the detection efficiency , and we can directly compare our data to the simulations .",
    "we find that the amount of background material is @xmath28 , which corresponds to the @xmath29 mentioned earlier plus scintillators , mylar foil , air , etc . in the target area .",
    "with this background we find the efficiency by dividing the background measurements with the simulations .",

    ", we also calculate the radiation cross section according to the formalism of blankenbecler & drell ( bd ) @xcite .",
    "blankenbecler later refined their treatment of the problem and included an extra correlation term @xcite .",
