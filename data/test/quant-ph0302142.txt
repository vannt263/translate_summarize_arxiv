    "the principal limit in high precision measurements and optics communication is given by the quantum fluctuations of light . for several years , in order to beat the standard quantum limit , a number of methods consisting in generating squeezed states of light have been developed @xcite . in connection with quantum information technology the quantum features of the polarization of light",
    "has raised a lot of attention .",
    "the generation of polarization squeezing has been achieved experimentally by mixing an opo - produced squeezed vacuum with a coherent field @xcite , or more recently by mixing two independent opa - originated squeezed beams on a polarizing beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "several schemes using kerr - like media have also been proposed @xcite , and very recently , matsko et al .",
    "proposed to propagate a linearly polarized field through a self - rotative atomic medium to produce vacuum squeezing on the orthogonal polarization @xcite .",
    "the kerr - like interaction between cold cesium atoms placed in a high finesse optical cavity and a circularly polarized field has been studied in our group and a field noise reduction of 40% has been obtained @xcite .",
    "we recently observed experimental evidence of polarization squeezing when the incoming polarization is linear @xcite . in this paper , we present a theoretical investigation of polarization squeezing generated by an ensemble of x - like 4-level atoms illuminated by a linearly polarized field . to be as realistic as possible ,",
    "the experimental parameters values of ref @xcite are taken as references .",
    "in the first part of the paper , we give a detailed study of the steady state and show that self - rotation is responsible for polarization switching and saturation leads to tristability .",
    "we derive simple analytical criteria for the existence of elliptically polarized solutions and the stability of the linearly polarized solution .",
    "this steady state study is essential to figure out the interesting working points for squeezing . in the second part , we focus on the case",
    "in which the polarization remains linear ( below the ps threshold ) and show that both the linearly polarized field mode and the orthogonal vacuum mode are squeezed .",
    "analytical spectra are derived in the low saturation limit and enable a clear discussion of the physical effects responsible for polarization squeezing ; in particular , we demonstrate that self - rotation is associated to strong atomic noise terms preventing vacuum squeezing at low frequency . on the other hand , saturation accounts for the squeezing on the mean field and crossed - kerr effect",
    "enables to retrieve vacuum squeezing at high frequency .",
    "the analytical results are compared with a full quantum calculation .",
    "finally , we derive the stokes parameters @xcite and relate their fluctuations to those of the vacuum field .",
    "the vacuum squeezing obtained is then equivalent to the squeezing of one stokes parameter , the so - called _ polarization squeezing _ @xcite .",
    "the system considered in this paper is a set of n 4-level cold atoms interacting in an optical cavity driven by a linearly polarized field as represented in fig [ fig1 ] .",

    "the field frequency is @xmath4 and the detunings from atomic resonance are equal on both transitions to @xmath5 .",
    "the 4-level system is described using collective operators for the n atoms of the ensemble , the optical dipoles being defined in the rotating frame associated to the laser frequency ( e.g. @xmath6 ) .",
    "the coupling constant between the atoms and the field is defined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the atomic dipole and @xmath9 . with this definition ,",
    "the mean square value of the field is expressed in number of photons per second . as in fig",

    "the langevin operators @xmath15 are @xmath16-correlated and their correlation functions are calculated via the quantum regression theorem @xcite .",
    "we consider a ring cavity with @xmath17 the transmission of the cavity coupling mirror , @xmath18 the cavity resonance frequency closest to @xmath4 and @xmath19 the cavity round - trip time .",

    "the incoming quantum fields are @xmath21 and the field equations read    @xmath22",
    "the atomic steady state is readily obtained by setting the time derivatives to zero and using the fact that a langevin operator mean value is zero . defining saturation parameters @xmath23 for both polarizations ,    @xmath24    the atomic steady state is given by    @xmath25    @xmath26 are the rabi frequencies and @xmath27 is the coupling saturation parameter which plays a symmetrical role with respect to both polarization components . for an x - polarized field , @xmath28 is directly related to the intracavity field intensity .",
    "it is well known that such a coupled system may exhibit polarization switching when driven by a linearly polarized field @xcite .",
    "in fact , the intracavity field intensities depend on the atomic dephasings @xmath29 and absorptions @xmath30    @xmath31    with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the linear dephasing and absorption in the absence of saturation . these quantities depend in turn on the intensities to yield a complex coupled system . in order to derive analytical criteria for polarization switching ,",
    "we follow the method given in @xcite and decompose dephasings and losses into their linear and non - linear parts ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the non - linear circular birefringence and dichroism , related to the ellipticity @xmath37 @xcite    @xmath38    thus , as pointed out in the literature @xcite , the optical pumping induces non - linear self - rotation ( sr ) of elliptically polarized light .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that this effect is responsible for ps in a cavity configuration .",
    "let us first focus on the solution for the @xmath1 components .",
    "normalizing all the dephasings and absorptions by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , eqs ( [ aplus]),([amoins ] ) read in steady state    @xmath42    with @xmath43 the maximal intracavity intensity in the absence of absorption . replacing ( [ spm ] ) in ( [ epsilon ] ) , we derive the equation for @xmath44 : non zero solutions correspond to elliptically polarized states .",
    "after straightforward calculations , we obtain    @xmath45    the first trivial solution corresponds to the linearly polarized field .",
    "it follows from the second equation and ( [ phil]),([al ] ) that elliptically polarized states may exist as soon as the existence criterion @xmath46 is satisfied    @xmath47    note that the absorption brings a positive contribution to the existence of asymmetrical solutions : this is due to the fact that non - linear circular dichroism produces `` self - elliptization '' of the field",
    ". however , this criterion gives no information on the stability of the solutions . in order to get some physical insight into this complicated problem",
    "it is useful to look at the evolution of the linearly polarized solution .      in this section ,",
    "we give a simple interpretation of ps as the threshold for laser oscillations .",
    "let us consider the linearly polarized solution along the x axis .",
    "the adiabatic elimination of the atomic variables leads to    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the intracavity field decay rate . in ( [ equationay2 ] )",
    "all terms have zero mean value and are of order 1 in fluctuations ( @xmath50 ) . using @xmath51 ,",
    "one obtains    @xmath52    owing to sr the fluctuations of the orthogonal mode undergo a phase dependent gain .",
    "a similar equation has already been derived in previous theoretical works in a single pass scheme @xcite . in our configuration",
    "the presence of the cavity will lead to oscillations of this mode as soon as the phase sensitive gain is larger than the losses .",
    "this condition may be expressed as follows    @xmath53    obviously , the linearly polarized solution is not stable when @xmath54 .",
    "however , the adiabatical elimination of the atomic variables does not _ a priori _ take all causes for instability into account .",
    "yet , we checked that this threshold analysis was consistent with a numerical calculation of the atom - field stability matrix . in the following we use @xmath55 as a stability criterion for the linearly polarized solution",
    "nevertheless , it does not yield information on the stability of the elliptically polarized solutions , which has been evaluated numerically . + besides , the ability of a system to produce squeezing being closely related to its static properties , the fluctuations of the vacuum field are expected to be strongly modified in the vicinity of the ps threshold . since eq ( [ equationay3 ] )",
    "is similar to that of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) below the threshold @xcite , perfect squeezing could be obtained via sr .",
    "however , the atomic noise is not included in ( [ equationay3 ] ) and is to be carefully evaluated .      ,",
    "the cavity dephasing corresponding to ps is @xmath57 , close to @xmath58 as given by the ps criterion .",
    "when the cavity detuning is scanned from the right , the linear solution is stable until @xmath59 and unstable afterwards .",
    "then the elliptically polarized solutions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , become stable for @xmath62 .",
    "we plot also the resonance peaks ( dashed line ) for the cavity with @xmath63 or @xmath64 atoms , in the absence of sr phenomenon.,width=377 ]    ps is caused by a competition between the two @xmath1 optical pumping processes .",
    "we can understand the main features of this effect by restraining ourselves to the case where absorption and saturation are negligible : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . neglecting the excited state populations , the optical pumping equations for the ground state populations are    @xmath67    so that the @xmath68 component tends to pump the atoms into level 2 , the @xmath69 into 1 , and , in steady state , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the circular birefringence @xmath72 is proportional to the ground state population difference , and consequently , to the intensity difference @xmath73 [ see ( [ epsilon ] ) ] .",
    "this simple analysis allows for relating self - rotation to competitive optical pumping and will help us interpret the resonance curves .",
    "+ under the previous conditions both criteria ( [ critereexistence ] ) and ( [ criterestabilite ] ) are equivalent and it follows that the linearly polarized solution bifurcates into an elliptically polarized state for @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , ps is observed as soon as the linear dephasing is greater than half the cavity bandwidth ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this represents an easily accessible condition from an experimental point of view : in our cesium experiment using a magneto - optical trap @xcite , the number of atoms interacting with the light is @xmath76 . to find realistic experimental parameters , we assimilate each one of our x - model transitions to the transition @xmath77 of the @xmath78 line of @xmath79 , for which @xmath80 mhz .",
    "the square of the coupling constant @xmath81 is proportional to the ratio of the diffusion section at resonance to the transversal surface @xmath82 mm@xmath83 of the beam , @xmath84 hz .",
    "the cavity transmission is 10% . to obtain a sufficiently high non - linearity , keeping the absorption low , a good detuning is @xmath85 , so that an approximate value for the linear detuning is @xmath86 .",
    "note that the saturation parameters of ( [ s ] ) are simply    @xmath87    the saturation intensity being @xmath88 mw / cm@xmath83 @xcite , typical values for @xmath23 are 0.1 - 1 .",
    "+ in fig [ fig2 ] are represented the admissible intensities for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 components versus the cavity detuning for typical experimental values of the parameters .",
    "the peak centered on @xmath90 corresponds to the symmetrical solution . when the cavity is scanned from right to left",
    ", the linearly polarized field ( @xmath91 ) intensity increases until the ps threshold is reached ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "then one elliptically polarized state becomes stable .",
    "the predominant circular component , say @xmath68 , creates , via the optical pumping process ( [ op1]-[op2 ] ) , a positive orientation of the medium @xmath93 , @xmath94 . since the atomic dephasing decreases to zero for the @xmath68 component ( @xmath95 ) , as if it were propagating in an empty cavity .",
    "hence , the solution draws close to the zero - dephasing peak , that is , close to resonance in the range @xmath62 . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath69 component `` sees '' all the atoms ( @xmath96 ) and breaks down to fit the peak centered on @xmath97 , which is far from resonance . in order to illustrate this interpretation of the resonance curves ,",
    "the two airy peaks centered on @xmath98 and @xmath97 are represented in fig [ fig2 ] . as the cavity detuning",
    "is decreased both asymmetrical solutions reunite when the criterion ( [ criterestabilite ] ) is no longer satisfied and the linear solution becomes stable again .",
    "these simple interpretations will help us understand the much more complex general case , when absorption and saturation come into play .",
    "+ as discussed in ref @xcite , taking into account the ground state relaxation rate @xmath99 yields tristability in the unsaturated optical pumping regime ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we will now show that the optical saturation also leads to tristability .      ,",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the linear absorption is @xmath103 .",
    "dashed parts indicate unstable solutions .",

    "@xmath106 for @xmath107 , so that the tristability range is @xmath108 .",
    "the arrows on the hysteresis cycle correspond to increasing and decreasing cavity detuning scan .",
    "below are plotted the two criteria : @xmath55 giving the stability of the linear solution ( plain ) and @xmath46 giving the existence of asymmetrical solutions ( dashed).,width=491 ]    it is well - known that saturation may induce multistability for the linearly polarized field @xcite in our configuration and substantially modify the steady state .",
    "when the non - linearity is sufficient , there may be three possible values for the x - polarized field intensity .",
    "therefore , saturation is an additional cause of instability for the symmetrical solution . in fig [ fig3 ]",
    ", we plotted the same curves as in fig [ fig2 ] , but for higher values of @xmath109 and @xmath58 .",
    "as expected , the linearly polarized state solution is distorted as a consequence of the non - linear effect .",
    "the effect of absorption is also clear : whereas the symmetrical peak height is reduced , the @xmath68 dominant peak height is not .",
    "indeed , the @xmath68 component `` sees '' no atoms after the switching .",
    "+ besides , the system now exhibits tristability for a certain range of the cavity detuning . as mentioned previously the existence of asymmetrical solutions",
    "is related to the positivity of @xmath46 , whereas the stability of the symmetrical solution is given by @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , on fig [ fig3 ] , @xmath106 for @xmath110 and the threshold @xmath111 is reached for a dephasing @xmath112 .",
    "thus , in the range @xmath113 , two different sets of asymmetrical solutions exist , in addition to the linear polarization state .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the saturation experienced by the @xmath68 and @xmath69 components .",
    "as expected , we checked that only the lower branch of each asymmetrical curve is stable , leading to tristability for the polarization state : linear , @xmath68-dominant or @xmath69-dominant .",
    "the system switches for a different value of the cavity detuning if the cavity is scanned from left to right , or from right to left ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "hence , unlike the unsaturated case , saturation induces a multistable behavior and a hysteresis cycle now appears in the resonance curve . +",
    "this brief study of the resonance curve for typical parameters leads to an essential observation : the lower branch of the bistability curve for the linear polarized field is not stable .",
    "we may wonder if there is a domain of the parameter space for which it is not the case .",
    "since the quantum fluctuations are expected to be most reduced in the vicinity of the lower turning point @xcite , the answer is of crucial importance for squeezing and will be treated in the next section .       as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "ps is the switching threshold , @xmath114 and @xmath115 the higher and lower turning points . for certain incident intensities",
    "@xmath109 three solutions ( 1,2,3 ) exist for the intracavity intensity @xmath116 , of which only one ( 3 ) is stable , instead of the usual two ( 1,3 ) in the absence of ps phenomenon .",
    ", width=377 ]    to complete the analysis of the steady state , we would like to emphasize that , when the cavity is scanned , ps always happens before reaching the higher turning point of the bistability curve .",
    "in order to get some insight into this complicated problem , it is worth looking at fig [ fig4 ] .",
    "we plotted the typical s - shaped variation of the linearly polarized field intensity @xmath117 versus the incoming intensity @xmath109 , for a fixed value of the cavity detuning @xmath118 .",
    "we choose the parameters so that there is bistability for this state of polarization and report the position of the lower ( @xmath115 ) and the higher ( @xmath114 ) turning points . in the absence of the ps phenomenon ,",
    "the solutions between @xmath114 and @xmath115 are unstable ( like 2 on fig [ fig4 ] ) , whereas solutions on the lower ( 1 ) and higher ( 3 ) branches are stable",
    ". however the stability of the linear polarization is modified by the ps effects . to a fixed value of",
    "the dephasing corresponds the ps intensity @xmath119 cancelling @xmath55 in ( [ criterestabilite ] ) ; if @xmath120 , then the linear polarization is unstable .",
    "hence , if @xmath121 is satisfied in the whole parameter space , then ps occurs before reaching @xmath114 , and , consequently , the lower branch is never stable .",
    "+ this general feature is shown on fig [ fig5 ] , in which we represented different bistability curves as in fig [ fig4 ] .",
    "the upper branch of ab is the @xmath114 curve ( the ensemble of the higher turning points when @xmath118 is varied ) , the lower branch is the @xmath115 curve . the dashed curve shows the ensemble of the intensities @xmath119 for which the polarization switches .",
    "this curve is always above the @xmath114 curve , confirming that the linear polarization always becomes unstable on account of ps first .",
    "what is more , we see that ps is closer to @xmath114 for low values of @xmath117 .",
    "we thus expect this situation to be the most favorable to achieve squeezing via optical bistability .",
    "we checked that varying the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath122 does not change the conclusion .",
    "as a function of @xmath109 for field @xmath123 .",
    "the three s - shaped curves correspond to different values of the cavity dephasing ( @xmath124 from left to right ) , @xmath58 and @xmath122 having the same value as in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "the ab segments represent the @xmath114 ( higher ) and @xmath115 ( lower ) curves .",
    "the dashed curve is the ensemble of the intensities @xmath119 for which polarization switching occurs .",
    "the system exhibits bistability for @xmath125.,width=415 ]    to conclude this section , we would like to point out that bistability , as well as ps , may disappear when the saturation is too high , as can be seen from fig [ fig4 ] .",
    "however , we will focus on the low saturation case in the large detuning limit which is the most favorable case for squeezing , and provides analytical results , as well as a clear physical understanding .",
    "since we are interested in the quantum fluctuations , we linearize the quantum operators around their steady state values following the standard linear input - output method @xcite .",
    "the elliptically polarized solutions are not of great interest for squeezing since the predominant circular component sees no atom and the other has negligible intensity . therefore , in all the following , we focus on the linearly polarized state and study how both the mean field @xmath123 and the orthogonal vacuum field @xmath126 may be squeezed .",
    "we have calculated the outgoing fields noise spectra via a full quantum treatment ( see e.g. @xcite ) involving the four - level system .",
    "the outgoing fields are standardly defined from the input - output relation @xcite :    @xmath127    yet , to provide clear interpretations as well as analytical results , we derive simplified equations , first for the mean field mode @xmath123 , then for the vacuum mode @xmath126 . + a similar equation to ( [ equationay2 ] ) can be derived for the field @xmath123 with a term arising from sr in @xmath128 . in the linearization , this product of zero mean value operators vanishes , so that we only have to take saturation into account to derive the spectra of @xmath123 .",
    "field squeezing owing to optical bistability has been widely studied @xcite and is known to occur on a frequency range given by the cavity bandwidth @xmath129 .",
    "the most favorable configuration is the bad cavity limit : @xmath129 is greater than @xmath130 ( in our experiment , @xmath131 ) . in the large detuning limit , @xmath132 ,",

    "this simplified equation yields the classical kerr terms in @xmath136 producing squeezing .",
    "note that absorption , dispersion and the associated atomic noise are not included in ( [ ax1 ] ) .",
    "the spectra taking absorption and dispersion into account can be easily derived and are shown on fig [ fig7 ] . the associated susceptibility and correlation matrices , @xmath137_{kerr}$ ] and @xmath138_{kerr}$ ] , of the linear input - output theory",
    "are reproduced in appendix , and the comparison with a kerr medium is discussed in @xcite . the situation is more complex for the orthogonal mode on account of sr .",
    "as mentioned in sec [ opo ] , sr seems to be a very promising candidate for generating vacuum squeezing .",
    "however , a careful analysis of the atomic noise , which can not be neglected , is necessary in the squeezing calculations . in the optical pumping regime",
    "the circular birefringence , @xmath139 , is proportional to the ground state population difference @xmath140 ( see sec [ opticalpumping ] ) .",
    "the sr effect is thus closely related to the fluctuations of @xmath141 , and consequently to the fluctuations of @xmath126 via the coupling term in @xmath142 [ eq ( [ equationay2 ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , we derive general equations for @xmath143 and @xmath144 in the fourier domain , and examine their low and high frequency limits . for the sake of simplicity , absorption and linear dispersion , again , are not shown ; however , the additional terms are included in the appendix .",

    "we can then calculate the outgoing vacuum field spectrum for all the quadratures .",
    "minimal and maximal spectra are plotted on fig [ fig6 ] in the `` close - to - bad '' cavity limit ( @xmath154 ) corresponding to our experimental configuration . whereas the first is close to the shot - noise level , the second is extremely noisy . in the good cavity limit",
    ", the noise is even more important .",
    "the conclusion is that the optical pumping process adds too much noise at zero frequency for sr to generate vacuum squeezing .",
    "however , this low frequency noise does not prevent squeezing at higher frequencies .",
    "if one repeats the previous calculation keeping the first order saturation terms in @xmath117 and considers frequencies @xmath173 , one finds    @xmath174    this is not surprising , since the evolution times considered are small with respect to the atomic relaxation time .",

    "more precisely , the optimal squeezing spectra are the same for each mode , but involve orthogonal quadratures [ because of the sign difference in the kerr terms between ( [ ax1 ] ) and ( [ aykerr ] ) ] .",
    "we now plot the outgoing fields @xmath182 squeezing spectra and discuss the squeezing optimization .",
    "to derive spectra for the whole frequency range , we combine both effects by adding the matrices obtained in the two asymptotical regimes studied previously . we write the complete susceptibility and correlation matrix under the form @xmath183_y=[\\chi(\\omega)]_{kerr}+[\\chi(\\omega)]_{sr}$ ] and @xmath184_y=[\\sigma(\\omega)]_{kerr}+[\\sigma(\\omega)]_{sr}$ ] , where the kerr matrices are those obtained in the high frequency limit , and the sr matrices those obtained at low frequency ( see appendix for analytical expressions ) .",

    "the parameters are chosen to be as close to the experimental situation as possible @xcite .",
    "we compared these approximate spectra ( a ) with those obtained with a full 4-level calculations based on the linear input - output theory ( b ) .",
    "the analytical spectra combining kerr and sr effects show indeed an excellent agreement with the exact calculations , as long as the saturation is low .",
    "as shown previously , the sr spectrum is close to the shot - noise level .",
    "the kerr spectrum is accurate for @xmath126 only for @xmath173 and extends on a range of several @xmath129 as expected @xcite . the combined spectrum ( a ) confirms that sr destroys completely the squeezing at low frequency and reproduces well the exact behavior ( b ) .",
    "the best squeezing for @xmath126 , obtained at intermediate frequencies , is about 25% .",
    "+ note that the kerr spectrum in ( a ) is also valid for field @xmath123 for all frequencies and 45% of squeezing is obtained at zero frequency .",
    "the situation for the mean field @xmath123 is identical to that of a circularly polarized field with intensity @xmath116 interacting with @xmath175 two - level atoms as in @xcite , for which the kerr spectrum shows good agreement with the exact spectrum .     given by the sr effect ( dashed ) , by the kerr effect ( light ) and by both effects ( dark ) .",

    "we verified this behavior by plotting on fig [ fig8 ] the evolution of the spectra when the cavity is scanned while keeping the incident intensity ( @xmath190 ) constant .",
    "it appears clearly that the best squeezing is obtained at the peak of the resonance curve , right before the switching .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the low saturation regime , the ps threshold is close to the point where saturation process is the most efficient .    ,",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath191 , @xmath188 .",

    "the conclusion is that , for given values of the detuning @xmath122 and linear dephasing @xmath58 , there is an optimal value of @xmath117 for squeezing .",
    "this is due to the fact that the range for which sr adds noise increases with the saturation and eventually destroys kerr - induced squeezing .",
    "the optimal saturation value thus corresponds to a compromise between added noise and kerr squeezing in the intermediate frequency range .",
    "therefore , a bad cavity is preferable ( @xmath198 ) , since kerr - induced squeezing occurs on a frequency range given by @xmath129 and sr destroys squeezing for frequencies smaller than @xmath130 .",
    "spectra for different cavities are represented in fig [ fig10 ] .",
    "the case @xmath154 corresponds to the experimental situation , `` close - to - bad cavity '' , the other curves to increasingly bad cavities .",
    "since sr is effective on a range smaller and smaller compared to the cavity bandwidth , its effect becomes negligible , and 75% of squeezing can be obtained .",
    "+ the conclusion is that very interesting squeezing values can be reached in the bad cavity limit for both the mean field mode and the orthogonal field mode . in the next section ,",
    "we establish the link between polarization squeezing and the vacuum squeezing obtained in our system .    .",

    "the noise of the mode with orthogonal polarization with respect to the mean field is commonly referred to as polarization noise .",
    "however , the study of the polarization state fluctuations requires the introduction of the quantum stokes operators @xcite    @xmath204    to be consistent with the definition of our slowly - varying envelope operators @xmath123 , @xmath126 , these stokes operators are time - dependent and expressed in number of photons per second @xcite .",
    "they obey the following commutation relationships    @xmath205=0\\hspace{0.7cm}and\\hspace{0.7 cm } \\left[s_{i}(t),s_{j}(t')\\right]= 2i\\epsilon_{ijk}s_{k}\\delta(t - t')\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath206 and then the spectral noise densities of these operators , defined by @xmath207 , satisfy uncertainty relations    @xmath208    the coherent polarization state correspond to the case where both modes @xmath123 and @xmath126 are coherent states .",
    "then the noise densities of the stokes parameters are constant and all equal to @xmath209 for @xmath210 .",
    "the so called polarization squeezing is achieved if one or more of these quantities ( except @xmath211 ) is reduced below the coherent state value    @xmath212    if the mean field is x - polarized , then @xmath213 and @xmath214 . at first order in noise fluctuations , @xmath215 and @xmath216 read    @xmath217    where @xmath218 is the phase of the mean field and @xmath219 is the quadrature with angle @xmath220 of the orthogonal mode .",
    "therefore the fluctuations of these two stokes parameters are proportional to the quadrature noise of @xmath126 and the polarization squeezing of @xmath221 and @xmath222 is simply related to the vacuum squeezing that we have studied in the previous sections .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is clear : let us choose @xmath223 , then geometric jitter on the polarization is due to the intensity fluctuations of @xmath126 ( @xmath224 ) , whereas the fluctuations of the ellipticity are caused by the phase fluctuations ( @xmath225 ) . in the general case ,",
    "the squeezed and antisqueezed stokes parameters are found to be    @xmath226    note that , unlike @xcite , there is no need to lock the phase - shift difference @xmath227 , since it is automatically done in this system ; this property appears clearly in eq ( [ aykerr ] ) where @xmath228 .",
    "since the new set of the stokes parameters @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 still satisfy the relationships ( [ heisenberg ] ) , we obtain polarization squeezing in our system as soon as any quadrature of the vacuum field @xmath126 is squeezed , and the results of the previous sections can be applied to the squeezed stokes component .",
    "we have presented a study of polarization switching in an x - like 4-level atoms ensemble illuminated by a linearly polarized light in an optical cavity .",
    "ps has been traced to self - rotation and simple criteria allow for a clear understanding of the switching effects and the multistable behavior of the system .",
    "the steady state analysis enables one to figure out the interesting working points for squeezing .",
