    "current theoretical models of structure formation in the universe are based on the paradigm of gravitational instability .",
    "this process is believed to be responsible for driving the growth of small primordial density perturbations into the nonlinear collapsed structures such as galaxies and clusters that are evident in the universe today .",
    "the premise of gravitational instability has been tested indirectly by comparing the clustering predicted by numerical simulations of the formation of cosmic structures with the observed distribution of galaxies ( e.g. benson et al .",
    "a direct test of this fundamental ingredient of structure formation models was made using the 2dfgrs by peacock et al .",
    "the size of the 2dfgrs allowed the first accurate measurement of the two - point galaxy correlation function on large scales .",
    "peacock et al . demonstrated that the two - point correlation function at large pair separations displays a form that is characteristic of the bulk motions of galaxies expected in the gravitational instability scenario .",
    "we present an independent test of the gravitational instability paradigm . for a gaussian distribution of density fluctuations , the volume averaged correlation functions , @xmath7 , are identically zero for @xmath8 ; the density field is completely described by its variance , @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of an initially gaussian density field due to gravitational instability generates non - zero @xmath7 ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "a basic test of the gravitational origin of the higher order moments is to determine their relation to the variance of the distribution .",
    "this is traditionally encapsulated in the hierarchical model : @xmath10 this model applies to real space clustering ; however , in redshift space the scaling still tends to hold even on small scales where the `` fingers - of - god '' effect is prominent ( lahav et al . 1993 ; hoyle , szapudi & baugh 2000 ) .",
    "perturbation theory predicts that the hierarchical amplitudes for the mass distribution are independent of the cosmological density parameter , the cosmological constant and cosmic epoch ( bernardeau et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we use the 2dfgrs ( colless et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) to measure the higher order correlation functions of the galaxy distribution , focusing on the clustering of @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "the size of the 2dfgrs is exploited to extract a volume limited sample of @xmath1 galaxies , which greatly simplifies our analysis ( section 2 ) .",
    "the results for the volume averaged correlation functions , up to sixth order , are presented in section 3 , in which we also test how well the hierarchical scaling model works .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the density of galaxies is a strong function of radial distance in a magnitude limited survey .",
    "this needs to be compensated for in any clustering analysis by applying a suitable weighting scheme ( e.g. saunders et al .",
    "alternatively , one may construct a volume limited sample by selecting certain galaxies from the full redshift survey .",
    "these galaxies are chosen so that they would appear inside the apparent magnitude range of the survey if displaced to any redshift within the interval defining the sample .",
    "the only radial variation in galaxy number density in a volume limited sample is due to large scale structure in the galaxy distribution .",
    "this makes volume limited samples much more straightforward to analyse than flux limited samples .",
    "however , only a fraction of the galaxies from the full redshift survey satisfy the selection criteria in redshift and absolute magnitude .",
    "this reduction in the density of galaxies has curtailed the utility of volume limited subsamples constructed from earlier redshift surveys .",
    "we construct a volume limited sample of @xmath1 galaxies from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the motivation for the choice of a sample centred on @xmath1 is clear ; this results in a volume limited sample with the largest possible number of galaxies for magnitude bins of a given size .",
    "as the luminosity used to define a sample increases , the selected galaxies can be seen out to larger redshifts and thus sample larger volumes .",
    "however , brighter than @xmath1 , the space density of galaxies drops exponentially ( e.g. norberg et al . 2002 ) .",
    "hence , the optimum balance between volume surveyed and intrinsic galaxy space density is achieved for @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "in addition , the higher order clustering of @xmath1 galaxies provides a benchmark or reference against which to compare trends in clustering strength with galaxy luminosity ( see norberg et al 2001 ; croton et al .",
    "we consider the two contiguous areas of the 2dfgrs , referred to as the ngp and sgp regions , which contain around 190,000 galaxies with redshifts and cover an effective area of approximately 1200 square degrees in total . after selecting galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath11 ( corrected to @xmath12 using the global @xmath13 correction quoted by norberg et al .",
    "2002 ) , the volume limited sample contains 44,931 galaxies .",
    "the redshift interval of the sample is @xmath14 to @xmath15 , corresponding to a volume of @xmath16 for the combined ngp and sgp regions .",
    "the distribution of counts in cells is estimated by throwing down a large number of spherical cells , on the order of @xmath17 for each cell radius considered , within the @xmath1 volume limited 2dfgrs sample .",
    "full details of how we deal with the spectroscopic incompleteness and the angular mask are given in croton et al .",
    "( 2004a ) ; the corrections turn out to be small in any case ( see figure 1 of croton et al . ) .",
    "the higher order correlation functions , @xmath7 , are the reduced @xmath18 order moments of the distribution of galaxy counts in cells .",
    "the estimation of the higher order correlation functions from the cell count probability distribution is explained in a number of papers ( e.g. gaztaaga 1994 ; baugh , gaztaaga & efstathiou 1995 ; croton et al .",
    "the variance or width of the count distribution is given by the case @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath8 , the correlation functions probe further out into the tail of the count probability distribution .",
    "we use mock 2dfgrs catalogues to estimate the errors on the measured higher order correlation functions .",

    "two different smoothing radii have been used to produce these maps ; the left - hand panel shows the density after smoothing with a circular cell of radius @xmath20mpc and the right hand panel shows the distribution as sampled with a cell of radius @xmath21mpc .",

    "we also plot the higher order correlation functions for the dark matter distribution in the @xmath4cdm hubble volume simulation ( evrard et al .",
    "these theoretical predictions include the effects of peculiar motions in the distant observer approximation .",

    "this confirms the conclusions reached in independent analyses of the clustering of @xmath1 galaxies in the 2dfgrs ( lahav et al .",
    "2002 ; verde et al .",
    "however , for the case of the @xmath4cdm hubble volume simulation , the @xmath8 moments of the dark matter differ from the measurements for @xmath1 galaxies for @xmath6mpc .    the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath27 , obtained from the @xmath7 by applying eq .",

    "this behaviour is mirrored for @xmath33 , with the upturn in @xmath27 seen at progressively smaller radii as @xmath0 increases .",

    ", the hierarchical amplitudes are expected to be approximately independent of scale over an even wider range of scales than those on which perturbation theory is applicable ( hoyle et al . 2000 ; bernardeau et al .",

    "the dotted lines indicate the @xmath37 uncertainty on the fit .",
    "the errorbars plotted in fig .  3 show only the diagonal component of the full covariance matrix .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath27 are extremely correlated , with the principal component analysis showing that the first few eigenvectors contain the bulk of the variance , indicating that there are typically just 2 or 3 independent points .",
    "sample variance leads to measurements which could be coherently shifted either low or high with respect to a fixed value .",
    "this therefore drives the best fit value of @xmath27 to lie either below or above a sizeable fraction of the data points . for the @xmath1 sample ,",
    "we note that neither @xmath30 nor @xmath38 are particularly well described by a constant fit ( see the reduced @xmath39 values in table 1 ) .    for purely illustrative purposes ,",
