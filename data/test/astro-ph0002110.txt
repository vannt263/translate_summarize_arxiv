    "data and information published in simbad come from selected catalogues and tables and from the whole astronomical literature .",
    "the specificity of the simbad database is to organize the information per astronomical object , thus offering a unique perspective on astronomical data .",
    "this is done through a careful cross - identification of objects from catalogues , lists , and journal articles .",
    "the ability to gather together any sort of published observational data related to stars or galaxies has made simbad a key tool used worldwide for all kinds of astronomical studies .",
    "simbad is the acronym for _ s_et of _",
    "i_dentifications , _ m_easurements and _ b_ibliography for _ a_stronomical _ d_ata .",
    "the main access point to simbad is the www home page ; there is a mirror copy at sao , harvard .      building a reference database for stars  and , later , for extragalactic objects and all astronomical objects outside the solar system ",
    "has been the first goal of the cds : simbad is the result of an on - going effort which started soon after the creation of cds in 1972 .",
    "simbad was created by merging the catalog of stellar identifications ( csi , ochsenbein et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the bibliographic star index ( ochsenbein @xcite ) as they existed until 1979 .",
    "the resulting data base ( at that time , about 400,000 objects , mainly stars ) was then expanded by the addition of source data from the catalogs and tables , and by new literature references .",
    "the database was extended to galaxies and other non - stellar objects in 1983 ( dubois et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for details about the early developments of simbad see egret ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first on - line interactive version of simbad was released in 1981 , and operated at the strasbourg cronenbourg computer center until december 1984 , when it was moved to universit paris - sud at orsay , and operated there until june 30 , 1990 .",
    "the database is now hosted on a unix server , at the strasbourg observatory .",
    "the original command line interface has been complemented by an interactive x - window interface ( xsimbad ) in 1994 , and by a world - wide web interface in 1996 .",
    "there is also a client / server mode , providing quick responses to simple queries , essentially for the name resolution in archives and information systems ( see section  [ interface ] ) .    for descriptions of earlier stages of the database , see heck & egret ( @xcite ) , and egret et al.(@xcite )",
    "simbad is , in the first place , a database of identifications , aliases and names of astronomical objects : in principle any name found in the literature  provided it is given as a syntactically correct character string  can be submitted to simbad in order to retrieve basic information known for this object , as well as pointers to complementary data and bibliography .",
    "this implies a continuous careful cross - identification of objects from catalogues , lists , and journal articles .",
    "this ability to gather together any sort of published observational data related to stars or galaxies is the first key feature of simbad .",
    "another unique feature is the complete and up - to - date bibliographic survey of the astronomical literature : objects are associated with the references of all papers in which they are mentioned , independently of the aliases used to name the object .",
    "in addition , the dictionary of nomenclature ( section [ dic ] ) is an essential tool for managing the very complex nomenclature of objects found in the literature , and for matching naming variations with those adopted or simply accepted by simbad .",
    "it also includes hints for helping to solve ambiguities , according to the type of object , or to the format .",
    "this is complemented by the _ sesame _ module within simbad , for the management of possible variations in the naming of astronomical objects .",
    "the database management system of simbad ( section [ dbms ] ) has been developed in - house at cds , using the concepts of object - oriented programming .",
    "simbad is kept up - to - date ( section [ update ] ) on a daily basis , as the result of the collaboration of cds with bibliographers in institut dastrophysique de paris and the paris and bordeaux observatories .",
    "the statistical contents of the database ( section  [ stats ] ) can be summarized in a few figures as follows ( the figures quoted are statistics of november 1999 ) :    * entries for about 2.7 million astronomical objects ( stars , galaxies and all astronomical objects outside the solar system ) ; * a cross - index of 7.5 million identifiers related to 4500 astronomical catalogues and tables , lists , and observation logs of space missions ; * observational data from some 25 different types of data catalogues and compilations ; * a bibliographic survey covering the astronomical literature since 1950 for stars , and since 1983 for extragalactic objects : more than 3 million citations from 110,000 different papers .",
    "the simbad data base presently contains information for about :    * 1,500,000 stars ; * 450,000 galaxies ; * 100,000 other non - stellar objects ( planetary nebulae , clusters , regions , etc . ) ; * and some 650,000 additional objects observed at various wavelengths ( radio , ir , x ) , and for which classification is not yet assigned .",
    "the only astronomical objects specifically excluded from simbad are the sun and solar system bodies .",
    "the simbad database is primarily organized per astronomical object .",
    "the aim is to provide , as much as possible , the user with all published information ( identifications , observational data , bibliographical references , and pointers towards external archives ) concerning any given object , or list of objects .    the two main channels for feeding the database are the following :    * the daily scanning of papers published in the astronomical literature provides new references and new identifiers for existing objects , as well as opportunities to create new objects , using the basic data possibly given in the article ; * the complete ( or partial ) folding of selected catalogues into the database serves as a basis for improving the completeness and multi - wavelength coverage of the database .",
    "catalogues are selected for integration with priority given to those which can help provide an optimal support for the large projects conducted within the astronomical community .",
    "a large effort was , for instance , devoted in recent years to stellar catalogues ( ppm , hic , ccdm ) , in the context of the hipparcos project , and to multi - wavelength identifications ( iras psc , einstein 1e and 2e catalogues , older x  ray catalogues , the iue merged log , etc . ) .",
    "the hipparcos and tycho catalogues ( esa @xcite ) have been recently included , and inclusion of the rosat all sky survey is planned in the near future .    in parallel ,",
    "the systematic scanning of the bibliography reflects the diversity and general trends of research in astronomy , and takes into account shorter lists .",
    "the published lists from the microlensing surveys , or e.g. the euve catalogues , were folded into the database as a result of this scanning .    when an object is found in the literature or in a catalogue , its possible cross - identification with objects already in simbad",
    "is systematically studied , before entering the reference and the new object name in the database .",
    "about 4500 different names of catalogues or object lists from published papers can currently be found in simbad , covering all the wavelength domains from high energy astrophysics to radio .    when no proper name is suggested by the authors , or when the acronym generates an ambiguity with already existing ones , the current practice , shared with the ned database , is to create an acronym within brackets using the initials of the last names of the first three authors , and the year of publication . for example ,",
    "[ hfe83 ] 366 is the 366th entry in the main table of a paper by helmer , fabricius , einicke and colleagues published in 1983 . from the year 2000 on , the year will be noted with four digits ( e.g. , [ abc2000 ] ) .",
    "many objects have more than one name , since the database contains more than 7.5 million object names for 2.7 million objects . examples of objects with more than 50 identifiers , are the galaxy in virgo , the bright stars and , the quasar , the .    to help the users with the complex nomenclature of astronomical objects , the cds now maintains and distributes on  line the dictionary of nomenclature of celestial objects ( first developed by lortet et al .",

    "* observational data ( also called _ measurements _ ) , for some 25 data types .",
    "a list of these types is given in the table  [ measurements ] .",
    "* general bibliography , including references to all published papers since 1983 citing the object under any of its designations . for stars ,",
    "the bibliography starts as early as 1950 , but with a smaller coverage of the literature .",
    "simbad also includes a few hundred references before 1950 , but without any systematic trend .",
    "the bibliography gives access to abstracts and electronic articles when available ( either directly from publishers , or through ads ) .",
    "currently about 100 journals covering the complete astronomical literature are regularly scanned .",
    "a complete list is available on line .    in the following",
    ", a more detailed description of some of these elements is given .",
    "the object type refers to a hierarchical classification of the objects in simbad , derived by the cds team on the basis of the catalogue identifiers ( as proposed by ochsenbein and dubois @xcite ) . from _ star _ to _ maser source _ , or _",
    "cluster of galaxies _ , some 70 different categories , general , or very specific , are proposed ( see examples in table  [ object - type ] ) .",
    "a complete list is available on line .",
    "this classification is intended to help the user select objects out of the database ( e.g.  through the filter procedure , see section  [ filter ] ) .",
    "it is also a powerful tool for data cross  checking and quality control .",
    "it has been designed to be practical and useful , and complements other features also available in simbad ( morphological type or spectral type information , catalogues , and measurements ) .",
    "it can follow the evolution of astronomy , with the introduction of new categories recently appeared in the literature ( e.g. , in the last years , low - mass or high - mass x - ray binary , microlensing event , or void ) .",
    "each class has normally a standard designation , a condensed one ( used in tables ) and an extended explanation .",
    "the classification uses a hierarchy with four levels , reflecting our knowledge of the characteristics of the astronomical object .",
    "for instance , an object can be classified as a `` star '' ( this is level 1 ) .",
    "if photometric observations have shown variability of the object , it can be classified as a `` variable star '' ( this is level 2 ) .",
    "examples of level 3 and 4 are `` pulsating variable '' , and `` cepheid '' .",
    "this hierarchy of object types ( and their possible synonyms ) is managed in the database in such a way that selecting variable stars ( v * ) is understood as selecting objects classified as v * , and all subdivisions ( e.g. pulsv * , mira , cepheid , etc . ) .",
    "if the user is only interested in rr lyrae type stars , he / she will use the rrlyr type , leaving aside all other variable stars for which the variability mode is different , or not known .",
    "the classification emphasizes the physical nature of the object rather than a peculiar emission in some region of the electromagnetic spectrum or the location in peculiar clusters or external galaxies .",
    "therefore objects are classified as peculiar emitters in a given wavelength ( such as uv or ir source ) only if nothing more about the nature of the object is known , i.e. it can not be decided on the sole basis of the basic data whether the object is a star , a multiple system , a nebula , or a galaxy .",
    "for instance , if an object appears only in the iras catalogue , it is automatically classified as ir object : it is left to the user to decide to go further and to derive , e.g. on the basis of the iras colors , the probability for the source to be stellar or extragalactic .",

    "< , < \" , ]     [ collaboration ]      the data contained in simbad are also permanently updated , as a result of errata , remarks from the bibliographers ( during the scanning of the literature ) , integration of lists and catalogues , quality controls , or special efforts initiated by the cds team to better cover some specific domains ( e.g. , multi - wavelength emitters and complex objects ) .",
    "requests for corrections , errata , or suggestions are regularly received from simbad users through a dedicated _ hot line _ , at e - mail address question@simbad.u-strasbg.fr .",
    "a few dozens of messages are usually received every week , and processed on a daily basis by the member of the team who is on duty for that week , or transmitted to the key person in case of specialized questions .",
    "remarks received from the users by this way are especially welcome , as they help the cds team to improve the database contents through the scrutiny of specialists eyes .",
    "developing new tools for quality control of the database is a major challenge for the future , and cds is exploring possible solutions .",
    "multivariate analysis applied to bibliographic information retrieval has been proven a possible tool for developing quality control in a database such as simbad ( lesteven @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of electronic publishing brings new perspectives for improvement and automation of the updating procedures .    in a first place ,",
    "tables of contents of the major journals are now received electronically through the network , thanks to journal editors and publishers , thus reducing the risk of errors .",
    "regularly , a number of electronic lists of objects are also folded into simbad through semi - automatic procedures",
    ". the next step will be the automatic flagging of object names in the text of the articles : this has now become a very interesting medium - term goal .",
    "two ways of achieving this flagging are currently being considered :    * the first one is to ask the authors , with the help of the editors of electronic journals , to flag astronomical object names in their text ; this can be done , for instance , by the use of a ` \\object { } ` command within the tex or latex source , which will be eventually used to build an anchor pointing towards simbad , or another database , in the on - line version made available on the network .",
    "this approach has been adopted by the editors of _ astronomy & astrophysics_. * another approach is the use of intelligent search tools for identifying object names within the electronic version of the paper , using a set of syntactic and semantic rules , and the dictionary of nomenclature as a reference database for already known objects .",
    "the first approach seems safer , provided the authors understand what exactly they are being required , and accept this ( minor ) additional work load .",
    "the latter implies a lot of fine tuning from the system developers . the current experience with the handling of publications ( lesteven et al .",
    "@xcite ) suggests that both approaches may be needed , and that a careful quality control , including final check by an expert , will probably remain necessary to avoid errors or misinterpretations , and to ensure appropriate completeness .",
    "designations of astronomical objects are often confusing .",
    "a complete list of astronomical designations has been collected and published by lortet et al.(@xcite ) in the _ dictionary of nomenclature of celestial objects outside the solar system_.    this information is available on - line through the info command , or on the www .",
    "this service is the electronic look - up version of the _ dictionary _ which is now under the responsibility of cds .",
    "it is kept up - to - date on a weekly basis ; about 15 new acronyms are incorporated every week .",
    "the _ dictionary _ currently provides full references and usages about some 5000 different acronyms .",
    "it is used by the international astronomical union as a reference for its recommendations related to nomenclature .      the _ sesame _ module is used inside simbad for the management of possible variations in the naming of astronomical objects .",
    "it is based on a list of rules , written as regular expressions , allowing translation of the submitted name into its simbad canonical form ; it is only made visible to the user when a message mentions the submitted syntax and its translation .",
    "there are cases where ambiguities can not be solved .",
    "this is actually specific to the broad context of simbad .",
    "let us give an example : in the context of extragalactic objects `",
    "n ' is a possible abbreviation for ` ngc ' ( accepted by ned ) ; but people studying novae would frequently use ` n ' as an abbreviation for nova , people studying regions would use it for naming nebulae in the magellanic clouds ( lha 120-n or lha 115-n ) , and ` n ' has also been found in the literature for cluster stars studied by nordlund in ngc 2099 ( cl * ngc 2099 n ) , for stars studied by neckel ( [ n78 ] ) , or even for ` new ' parts of the galaxy ngc 1275 ( [ njs93 ] in simbad ) . when a name like ` n  1992 ' is submitted to simbad the ambiguity",
    "can not be solved without requesting additional information from the user .",
    "while the cds databases have followed different development paths , the need to build a transparent access to the whole set of cds services has become more and more obvious with the easy navigation permitted by hypertext tools ( genova et al .",
    "aladin has become the prototype of such a development , by giving comprehensive simultaneous access to simbad , the vizier catalogue service , and to external databases such as ned , using a client / server approach and , when possible , standardized query syntax and formats .    in order to be able to go further",
    ", the cds has built a general data exchange model , taking into account all types of information available at the data center , known under the acronym of glu for gnrateur de liens uniformes  uniform link generator ( fernique et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the current stage of development ,",
    "the www interface to simbad provides access to aladin previewer ( reference image around one object ) , and to the aladin interactive java program ( see bonnarel et al .",
    "there are also links between simbad and the bibliographic services developed or mirrored at cds , and more generally to the ads and the electronic journals .    while this article is written stronger links between simbad and vizier",
    "are just being created allowing even easier transfers of data and information between both services .",
    "this will also make easier to build new links pointing to distributed data archives , beyond those already existing ( currently : iue / ines and heasarc ) .",
    "in the near future , the cds team expects to go on enriching the database contents and system functionality .",
    "the users play an important role in that respect , by giving feedback on the desired features , on the user - friendliness of the interfaces , etc .    in the context of interoperability of distributed services ,",
    "as currently discussed within the isaia project ( interoperable systems for archival information access ; hanisch @xcite ) , simbad is prepared to deliver resource profiles and to format the query outputs in a standard way , for instance xml ( ochsenbein et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as larger and larger astronomical datasets are being produced , the cds is studying the concepts of a new generation database of several billion objects , instead of the current several million objects .",
    "we expect simbad to remain an essential tool for astronomical research in the years to come .",
    "cds acknowledges the support of insu - cnrs , the centre national detudes spatiales ( cnes ) , and universit louis pasteur ( ulp , strasbourg ) .",
