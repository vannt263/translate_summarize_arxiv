    "understanding macroscopic socio - economic phenomena of a large number of individuals has been extensively studied by means of social , physical , and computational sciences  @xcite .",
    "recent access to large - scale digital datasets on human dynamics and social interaction has enabled us to quantitatively investigate the structure and dynamics of human communication networks .",
    "indeed , researchers have studied various datasets , ranging from email and mobile phone communications to social network services , e.g. twitter and facebook  @xcite .",
    "mobile phones or handsets are now actively utilized to accurately measure or sense human behavior because the handsets equipped with a variety of sensors , including gps and wifi , are carried around by the users everyday and all day through .",
    "highly resolved location data collected from handsets have been recently used to uncover human mobility patterns  @xcite .",
    "the reliability of data collected from handsets , i.e. `` behavioral '' data , was tested in the serial studies conducted within the frame of mit s reality mining project  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the behavioral data are at least comparable to self - report survey data in terms of friendship network and even capturing information that self - reports are missing  @xcite .",
    "the handset usage patterns are known to be diverse among users when measured by the number or duration of the phone sessions and by the amount of data received , to name a few  @xcite . within the individual handset usage patterns , temporal inhomogeneities due to circadian and weekly cycles",
    "were also reported  @xcite , which are in close relation to the spatial inhomogeneities , such as nighttime at home and daytime in office .",
    "therefore , for conducting a comprehensive study , it is important to identify the context characterizing the situation of handset user , and then to understand how the context affects service usage patterns  @xcite .",
    "however , it is only very recently when the effect of context on the handset - based service usages was investigated .",
    "but so far the analysis has been conducted mostly at the aggregate level , while the temporal diversities of service usage among users have been ignored  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study spatiotemporal correlations of the service usage patterns of individual users by analyzing a handset - based dataset .",
    "this dataset was collected from 124 users handsets for over 16 months as a part of the otasizzle project at aalto university , finland  @xcite . a software installed on handsets collected information about the handset s locations and usages of various services , including web domain visits , applications , emails , voice calls , and short message services , with the resolution of seconds in time and mobile network base stations spatially .",
    "after constructing spatiotemporal trajectories of the users we identify several contexts that are meaningful to them by using the context detection method  @xcite .",
    "other methods include , for example , places of interest or meaningful locations  @xcite and eigenmode analysis  @xcite .",
    "then , we find correlations between the spatiotemporal trajectories and the service usage patterns .",
    "we observe the similarity and diversity in temporal patterns of the service usages and discuss their temporal correlations , time - ordering behavior between services , and behavioral overlap network based on the clustering results .",
    "our approach provides a useful framework for handset - based data analysis , and hence it would be important for better design of information and communications technology ( ict ) enabled social environments and services .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the data collection and preparation methods . in section  [ sec : detect ] several contexts for each user are identified by means of the context detection method applied to user s spatiotemporal trajectory . in section",
    "[ sec : correl ] we uncover the spatiotemporal correlations and the similarity and diversity in temporal patterns of the service usages .",
    "finally , we summarize the results with concluding remarks in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the handset - based dataset in this study was collected by the mobitrack software installed on nokia symbian smartphones of 183 participants or users from september 2009 to december 2010 , i.e. for a period spanning about 16 months .",
    "all users were students and staff members of aalto university , finland and identified as early adopters of mobile phones and services  @xcite .",
    "the dataset was anonymized so that no personal information of the users could be obtained .",
    "we consider only 124 users with the overall duration of handset usage longer than 30 days , see section  [ sec : detect ] for details .",
    "the dataset consists of two kinds of information : locations and service usages .",
    "the resolution of locations is limited to the physical area covered by each mobile network base station , i.e. cell , denoted by @xmath0 . whenever the handset is connected to a new cell or otherwise every half an hour ,",
    "the identifier of the cell connected by the handset was recorded with a timestamp @xmath1 with one second resolution .",
    "each cell can be located in the geographical space with a unique pair of latitude and longitude .",
    "the geographic information for cells and the maps used in figs .",
    "[ fig : maps ] and  [ fig : contexts ] were collected as a part of the opennetmap project and from open databases  @xcite . for all users we have 5596041 records at 99206 different cells .",
    "although only @xmath2 of cells could be located in the geographical space , they correspond to @xmath3 of records .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps ] shows all located cells over the world , in finland , and in the helsinki municipal area . in this way",
    ", the detailed spatiotemporal trajectory of each user could be constructed in terms of a sequence of cell records @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the ordered index of record .    for service usage data we consider five services : web domain visit ( web ) , application ( app ) , email , voice call ( call ) , and short message service ( sms ) . each service usage or event",
    "was recorded with a timestamp with one second resolution together with service - specific relevant information . in the case of web domain visits , a url ( uniform resource locator )",
    "was extracted and recorded whether it was visited via browser or widget . only the applications visible in the foreground of the handset",
    "were recorded so that no process or application running in the background was considered .",
    "the records of communication services , such as email , call , and sms , include the information on whether the user was an initiator or receiver of the communication event , and on the communication partner if available . for more information regarding the data collection method , see  @xcite .",
    "the service usage dataset contains events mostly generated by users but it also contains automatic events by the operating system of the handsets . in order to observe the pure human behavior , we systematically filtered out these automatic events .",
    "however , some spurious regularities still remain in the web dataset . in the cases of google.com , facebook.com and so on ,",
    "once a web is connected , the browser might visit the same web automatically for periodic updates and synchronization of accounts until the web is disconnected . to resolve this issue",
    ", we obtain the distribution of inter - event time @xmath6 , defined as the time interval between consecutive web domain visits by the same user .",
    "several sharp peaks at specific inter - event times are found , where each peak is mostly related to the single webpage .",
    "we remove all the events leading to those inter - event times , except for the event trains consisting of only two events with @xmath7 seconds .",
    "it is because some trains with only two events separated by @xmath8 seconds can also be generated by users . as new regularities",
    "become visible after filtering , we apply this method recursively until the peaks are suppressed considerably , leading to an approximately @xmath9 of entire events removed .",
    "figure  [ fig : distrinterweb ] shows that this filtering method for web dataset does not change the overall characteristics of the inter - event time distribution .",
    "we also ignore some user - generated application events associated with other service usages , corresponding to @xmath10 of entire events .",
    "for example , the user opens the messaging application when sending or receiving smss .",
    "these application events might lead to artificial correlations between different service usages .",
    "in addition , corrupted events , less than @xmath11 of the whole dataset , have been ignored or manually corrected . finally , we have 792971 web domain visits , 433726 application events , 17976 emails , 79779 calls , and 79283 smss in the service usage dataset .",
    "( colored boxes ) from a sequence of cell records @xmath4 ( vertical black lines ) .",
    "it is assumed that the user stays in the cell @xmath12 from the moment of @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "see the text for details . ]",
    "in order to detect the contexts for each user , we construct the user s spatiotemporal trajectory from a sequence of cell records @xmath4 .",
    "it is necessary to infer the user s location between consecutive timestamps of cell records . from a sequence of cell records ,",
    "we derive the temporal boundaries @xmath15 for the user s trajectory , implying that the user stays within the area covered by cell @xmath12 from the moment of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : timeboundary ] .",
    "it is assumed that the user stays in the cell @xmath12 till @xmath16 and then in the cell @xmath17 from @xmath18 when @xmath19 .",
    "here we set @xmath20 as half an hour , i.e. the time interval for regular cell recording .",
    "the time interval between consecutive timestamps longer than @xmath21 implies that the handset may be turned off , used in offline or airplane mode , or not able to detect any cell nearby . if @xmath22 , the user is considered to stay in the cell @xmath12 till @xmath23 and in the cell @xmath17 from @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the location is unknown between @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "then , the total time spent , i.e. duration , in each cell @xmath0 is obtained as follows : @xmath26 if the sum of durations in all the recorded cells , @xmath27 , is less than 30 days , that user is not considered for the further analysis , leading to 124 available users .",
    "the average and standard deviation of @xmath28 for available users are @xmath29 days .",
    "in addition , we observe back and forth changes in a short time span between two cells covering the neighboring areas . it can occur even without any real movement of the handset if the handset is located at the boundary of two neighboring cells . to filter out this noisy behavior ,",
    "the involved cells can be clustered by a sandwich clustering method  @xcite .",
    "here we consider only one type of sandwich with four records involving two cells , i.e. @xmath30 with @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "whenever this type of sandwich is detected , every @xmath12 in the temporal boundaries is replaced by or merged into @xmath17 if @xmath33 , and vice versa .",
    "consequently , some geographically neighboring cells can be clustered into one representative cell , which from now on will be considered equally with normal cells .",
    "for example , the first row in fig .",
    "[ fig : user81 ] shows the user 81 s temporal boundaries during typical friday and saturday .",
    "note that clustering cells for one user is independent of other users records .",
    "we find spatiotemporal inhomogeneities of the trajectories of handsets on the individual basis as well as at the aggregate level .",
    "as an illustrative example , we obtain the rank curve @xmath34 , defined as the duration in the @xmath35th cell @xmath0 in a descending order according to @xmath36 .",
    "the rank curve for all users is highly skewed , such that the first few cells , including one in otaniemi campus of aalto university , were visited for more than a few months while @xmath37 of cells were visited for less than one hour , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : durationrank ] .",
    "the same inhomogeneities are also observed for individual users .",
    "for example , the rank curves for users 5 and 81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : durationrank ] , who were selected to show the representative behavior .",
    "the heavily visited cells are supposed to cover meaningful places to the handset user , such as home and office . since the service usage patterns might be affected by the different characteristics of meaningful places , it is important to identify the context characterizing the situation of user . here",
    "the context is preferred to the meaningful place because the time and place of handset usage are not independent but correlated , e.g. nighttime at home and daytime in office  @xcite .",
    "each cell will be detected as one of five contexts , such as home , office , other meaningful place ( other ) , elsewhere ( else ) , and abroad .",
    "one context can be assigned to several cells .",
    "the identifier of a cell contains the mobile country code ( mcc ) , by which abroad context is assigned to the cells out of finland .",
    "for the cells within finland , we obtain more detailed durations for each cell @xmath0 :    1 .",
    "duration on weekdays ( @xmath38 ) , 2 .",
    "duration on weekdays between 0 am and 6 am ( @xmath39 ) , and 3 .",
    "duration on weekdays between 10 am and 4 pm ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "now we describe criteria for assigning contexts except for abroad .",
    "a cell is detected as elsewhere ( else ) if the duration in that cell is negligible to the total duration as @xmath41 for example , else is assigned to the cells along the highways .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath42 has been determined in order to leave only @xmath43 of cells , i.e. @xmath44 cells per user , for other contexts .",
    "a cell is detected as office if the user spends a considerable time in that cell during the working time on weekdays as @xmath45 and @xmath46 with above threshold values , at least one office has been detected for more than half of the users . note that most users were students so that they might not have any regular places to visit during the working time .",
    "next , home is assigned to a cell if the user spends a considerable time in that cell for nighttime and free time , i.e. the remaining time except for the working time , on weekdays as @xmath47 and @xmath48 with above threshold values , at least one home has been detected for all users except for two of them .",
    "many users turn out to have more than one home , such as user s own home and his / her parent s home .",
    "finally , the remaining cells are detected as other meaningful place ( other ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : contexts ] shows the locations of detected contexts for sample users in the helsinki municipal area .",
    "we put two sample users contexts together to avoid privacy issues .",
    "our context detection method is validated by weekly patterns of duration for different contexts obtained for sample users and at the aggregate level , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : contextdurationweek ] .",
    "for example , the user 5 without other detected shows a very regular pattern , especially on weekdays , i.e. at home in nighttime , in office during the working time , and at else when moving between home and office .",
    "weekly patterns of user 81 are comparable to the temporal boundaries in terms of detected contexts , as depicted in the second row in fig .",
    "[ fig : user81 ] . weekly patterns of duration aggregated over all users show the overall behavior .",
    "durations at home , office , other , and else account for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 of the total duration of all users , respectively .",
    "we investigate correlations between users spatiotemporal trajectories and their service usage patterns . here five services , such as web domain visit ( web ) , application ( app ) , email , voice call ( call ) , and short message service ( sms ) , are considered and each service is denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "the spatiotemporal correlation of service usages for user @xmath54 is fully characterized by the number of events corresponding to the service @xmath53 in the cell @xmath0 and at time @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath55 . for gaining contextual understanding of correlations",
    "we consider the contexts instead of cells , i.e. @xmath56 , where the summation is over @xmath0 detected as context @xmath57 .",
    "we first focus on the contextual correlations of service usages with @xmath58 .",
    "since services have qualitatively different characteristics , the numbers of events of different services can not be directly compared to each other but only in terms of fractions and intensities of usages .",
    "the fraction of service usage is defined as follows @xmath59 figure  [ fig : actcellcontext ]  ( left ) shows the fractions for sample users 5 and 81 as well as their means over all users with standard errors , measured by the bootstrap method .",
    "the handset of user 5 has never been abroad and no other context is detected . for this user",
    "all service usages are more active at home and office than at else , which is very different from the service usage patterns of user 81 . due to the diversity of the service usage patterns among users ,",
    "any general conclusion can not be made on the individual basis . however , by looking at the means with standard errors , it is found that all service usages are the most active at home , while they are relatively inactive for other contexts .",
    "given the aggregate durations for different contexts obtained in the section  [ sec : detect ] , this finding can be explained such that the longer duration for some context means the higher chance for service usage .",
    "accordingly , instead of the fractions of service usages we consider those divided by the corresponding durations as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the duration of user @xmath54 for context @xmath57 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : actcellcontext ]  ( right ) . despite of the diversity among users ,",
    "the means of intensities of different services for the same context have to some extent similar values .",
    "the large mean of intensity of email usage in office might be due to the fact that users prefer emails to calls or smss in classes or laboratories during the working time .",
    "the large mean of intensity of web usage at else could be the result of users killing time by surfing the webpages while on the move .",
    "one could also say that users while abroad tend to use smss more than other communication services . finally , for all services , only the means of intensity at home turn out to be less than 1 and most inactive , which could be partly because users have many other activities to do at home .",
    "we turn to analyze the temporal correlations of service usages in terms of @xmath62 , where the summation is over all contexts with one exception , abroad .",
    "it is because the service usage abroad can not be considered as normal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : actcellcontext ] .",
    "we first obtain weekday and weekend patterns of service usages as @xmath63 for @xmath64 with @xmath65 day . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath66 denote the indexes of weekdays and weekends , respectively .",
    "the weekday and weekend event rates of service @xmath53 for user @xmath54 are defined as @xmath67},\\\\ \\label{eq : shortpatternweekend } \\rho^{\\rm we}_{is}(t)&=&\\frac{a ' n^{\\rm we}_{is}(t)}{\\sum_t [ a n^{\\rm wd}_{is}(t)+a ' n^{\\rm we}_{is}(t)]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are weights for normalization .",
    "in addition we obtain the weekday and weekend event rates averaged over all users .             between consecutive events of different services @xmath53 and @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig : actshortpattern ] we show the individual event rates for sample users 5 and 81 as well as the event rates averaged over all users .",
    "the overall behavior of the individual and user - averaged event rates reflects typical weekly cycles of humans by being more active in the daytime and on weekdays and less active in the nighttime and on weekends . from the user - averaged event rates",
    ", we find that email ( call ) is more used around noon ( late afternoon ) on weekdays , while email ( call ) is less ( more ) used than other services in the weekend daytime . since most users in our dataset were students and staff members of the university , they might not be making or receiving calls in classes or laboratories in the weekday daytime .",
    "instead they might be using other communication services , such as email and sms . on the other hand",
    ", users might be using call more than email outside class or laboratory on weekends .    to investigate the temporal correlations between service usages for each user",
    ", we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient ( pcc ) by using the event rates of services @xmath53 and @xmath70 for user @xmath54 : @xmath71[\\rho_{is'}(t)-\\bar \\rho_{is ' } ] }      { \\sqrt{\\sum_t [ \\rho_{is}(t)-\\bar \\rho_{is}]^2}\\sqrt{\\sum_t [ \\rho_{is'}(t)-\\bar \\rho_{is'}]^2 } } ,      \\label{eq : pcc}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 . for the pcc on weekdays and on weekends , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are used , respectively .",
    "the values of pcc turn out in most cases to be positive ( not shown here ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the typical weekly cycles of humans as mentioned before . to correct such cycles , for each case of weekdays and weekends we consider de - seasoned event rates defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the number of services the user @xmath54 have used .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : actweekcorrel ] , the values of pcc obtained for the de - seasoned event rates show similar and distinct behavior among users as well as between weekdays and weekends .",
    "for example , in the case of user 5 , the strongly positive correlation between call and sms usages on weekdays turns to be slightly negative on weekends .",
    "this result is consistent with the temporal patterns depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : actshortpattern ] . the positive ( negative ) correlation between services by being used at the same time ( at different times ) of the week",
    "can be interpreted such that those services are complementary ( substitutive ) with each other  @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain and compare distributions of pcc over all users for each pair of services .",
    "the mean values for web - app and call - sms pairs ( app - email pair ) are slightly positive ( negative ) on weekdays and become slightly negative ( positive ) on weekends .",
    "all other pairs have the negative mean values .",
    "the result for positive correlations is inconclusive due to the large standard errors of pcc up to @xmath77 .",
    "however , for the pairs of services with large negative correlations , such as web - call and web - sms pairs , we can argue that those services might be used in a substitutive way . in order to compare the correlations for weekdays and for weekends ,",
    "we have conducted the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "it is found that the distributions of pcc for weekdays and for weekends are significantly different for the pairs of web - app ( @xmath78-value less than @xmath79 ) , app - email ( @xmath80 ) , email - call ( @xmath80 ) , email - sms ( @xmath80 ) , and call - sms ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this list of pairs contains all the pairs whose sign of the mean has changed from weekdays to weekends .",
    "for more detailed , i.e. event - based analysis of correlations among service usages , we obtain the distribution of time interval between two consecutive or simultaneous events but of different services of the same user .",
    "precisely , the time interval for a pair of services @xmath53 and @xmath70 is defined by @xmath82 with event timings @xmath83 and @xmath84 . as shown in the upper panels of fig .",

    "this indicates that the event of service @xmath53 follows that of service @xmath70 . on the other hand , distributions for other pairs of services",
    "do not show any distinct peaks , implying no temporal correlation .",
    "this time - ordering behavior could mean that one service usage might effectively induce another service usage .",
    "however , we can not investigate such a process by our dataset .",

    "we showed how the context affects the service usage patterns of users , including their web domain visit ( web ) , application ( app ) , email , voice call ( call ) , and short message service ( sms ) .",
    "in this study we have found the similarity and diversity of weekly patterns among users and services , in terms of temporal correlations , time - ordering behavior between services , and overlap network based on clustering .",
    "the services used at the same time ( at different times ) of the week lead to the positive ( negative ) correlations between them , which can be interpreted as being complementary ( substitutive ) to each other . by conducting the event - based analysis instead of weekly patterns",
    "we observe the time - ordering behavior between services , such that communication services , i.e. email , call , and sms , are followed by the non - communication services , i.e. web and app .",
    "finally , the similarity and diversity of weekly patterns of service usages enable us to classify users into several different clusters , e.g. as characterized by the morning - type or evening - type usage patterns , except for the web and email usages .",
    "the behavioral overlap network constructed based on the clustering results can be used to reveal the communication or real social network structure of users .",
    "our findings on the spatiotemporal correlations of service usage patterns for different contexts enable us to better understand the behavior of humans and what that implies .",
    "this is also important for better design of information and communications technology ( ict ) enabled social environments and services .",
    "however , more detailed analysis with higher resolution is required to reveal the underlying mechanism or the origin of spatiotemporal correlations .",
