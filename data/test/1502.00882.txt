    "credit ratings have become an integral part of today s capital markets as they help in the evaluation and assessment of credit risk , benchmark issues and create secondary markets for those aspects .",
    "credit risk exists virtually in all income - producing activities and their inappropriate evaluation or inadequate mitigation would result in failure of institutions . in general , the credit ratings given by agencies such as standard and poor , moody and fitch are based on the probability of default and recovery rate taking into account not only the variables in the financial statement of the firms but also the market cues . predicting bankruptcy for firms in financial distress from the financial statement history is an important problem studied widely by the researchers @xcite . among them",
    "the altman s z - score @xcite is the most popular and widely accepted metric for predicting the bankruptcy . the popularity of z - score may be attributed to its simplicity in computation and ease in its application @xcite .",
    "altman s z - score uses mainly accounting figures in the financial statement as variables in the computation .",
    "the z - score is highly sensitive to small variations in these figures due to its dependency on them .",
    "this leads to an exaggerated z - score in case they are manipulated as it does not include the past accounting profile of the business into consideration during its computation .",
    "therefore , the bankruptcy probability predictions using altman s z - score would cause significant levels of type - i errors ( classifying bankrupt firms as non - bankrupt ) . @xcite demonstrated the bias of z - score in predicting the bankruptcy .",
    "in addition , the models have the weakness of not being immune to false accounting practices @xcite .",
    "it is stated by altman that the retained earnings account is subject to manipulation via corporate quasi - reorganizations and stock dividend declarations , which may cause a bias @xcite .",
    "moreover the weights used by altman are still prevalent even though the financial reporting environment has changed drastically from a rule - based approach to a principle - based set of standards aiming for harmonization with the international financial reporting standards ( ifrss ) @xcite .    the z - score , which is a derivative of financial ratios may not represent different risks using same quantitative figures or same business risks for different financial statement figures . to account for this asymmetry , the z - score may be adjusted by including the earnings management in the computation procedure @xcite but it may also be exposed to manipulations in the accounting data .",
    "these models should not be applied to financial firms due to their frequent use of off balance - sheet items @xcite .",
    "also , the results of the model may vary over time , which may be explained by the uncertainty of the stock prices as they are subject to the stock market opinion . during periods when the stock market is relatively high , the z - score outcomes will be higher than in times when stock prices are low .",
    "the financial scores are linearly combined to obtain the z - score using the weight functions derived from the multivariate discriminate analysis . in realistic scenarios the financial ratios used as",
    "independent variables may not be linearly related .",
    "also , the score is biased to small variations in the financial scores .",
    "moreover , it is not possible to compare the performance of different firms such as non - manufacturing , manufacturing as the weights of the financial ratios would differ among different firms .",
    "further , it is difficult / not feasible to develop specific models tailored to address the scenarios of each type of industry ( retailers , airlines etc . ) even though it may look ideal @xcite .",
    "keeping in view the shortcomings of altman s z - score and the adjusted z - score @xcite , we frame the following objectives for the present study :    1 .   developing a score based method using a nonlinear form of financial ratios ; 2 .   designing an index using an equi - probability transformation by fitting a pearson type 3 ( p3 ) distribution to the newly developed z - score say @xmath4 ; 3 .   formulating a rating scheme based on the index ; 4 .   comparing the @xmath4 with altman s z - score and the proposed rating scheme with those being employed widely by financial institutions for bankruptcy predictions .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we propose a new nonlinear transformation model for computing the @xmath5-score while in section  [ sec3 ] a new index ( based on the @xmath4 ) using a p3 distribution is developed .",
    "the methodology followed for predicting the bankruptcy probability of firms is presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the datasets and the results are described in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "conclusions and discussion are deferred to section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "the standard z - score is a statistical measurement of a scores s relationship to the mean in a group of scores generally measured by the formula @xmath6 in which @xmath7 denotes the set of measurements , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively denote the mean and standard deviation of the data in the set @xmath7 .",
    "the z - score is a very useful statistic for obtaining the probability of a score occurring within a normal distribution and comparison of two scores that are from different normal distributions . @xcite",
    "first proposed a z - score measuring a company s financial strength using a weighted sum of several factors among the variables ( financial ratios ) that gives an approximate description of the bankruptcy probability .",
    "@xcite utilized a data set composed of sixty - six corporations with thirty - three firms in each of the two risk groups and financial ratios given in table  [ tab1 ] to obtain a set of ratios that influence the bankruptcy prediction .",
    "the mean asset size of these firms was $ 6.4 million , with a range between $ 0.7 million and $ 25.9 million .",
    ".financial ratios previously used in bankruptcy prediction studies [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     [ tabclassmatx ]    the actual group membership is equivalent to the a priori grouping and the predicted group refers to the cases wherein the proposed methodology attempts to classify them correctly . in the table [ tabclassmatx ] @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the correct classifications ( hits ) and @xmath12 , @xmath13 denotes the misclassifications ( misses ) .",
    "@xmath10 ( @xmath14 ) gives the number of cases of actual bankruptcy correctly classified as bankrupt by the proposed method .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath15 ) is the type - i error that gives the number of cases wherein the actual group membership is bankrupt whereas the proposed model misclassified them as non - bankrupt .",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath16 ) is the type - ii error , that denotes the number of actual cases belonging to non - bankrupt group misclassified as bankrupt by the proposed model .",
    "@xmath11 ( @xmath17 ) are the number of cases wherein the proposed model correctly labels the actual cases as non - bankrupt .",
    "the accuracy of the proposed methodology is computed as @xmath18 .",
    "the type - i error is the ratio of misclassified cases of actual bankrupt cases declared as non - bankrupt by the model with total bankrupt cases i.e type -",
    "i = @xmath12/@xmath19 ) = @xmath20 .",
    "the type - ii error is the ratio of misclassified cases of actual non - bankrupty cases declared as bankrupt by the model with total non - bankrupty cases i.e type - ii=@xmath13/@xmath21)=@xmath22 .",
    "the proposed method with thresholds as given in equation [ eqn12 ] is accurate in classifying @xmath23 of total samples with type i error to be only @xmath24 while the type ii error was even better at @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , there is a positive upward bias which can be addressed by adjusting the thresholds between the credit ratings @xmath26 and @xmath27 as the boundaries fall in the grey zone . keeping the other thresholds unchanged",
    ", we updated the thresholds of @xmath27 as @xmath28 and @xmath26 as @xmath29 from the classification table , we obtained the type i error as @xmath30 and type ii error as @xmath31 with overall accuracy of @xmath32 . to see if the sensitivity be further improved we updated the thresholds of @xmath27 as @xmath33 and @xmath26 as @xmath34 keeping the others unchanged .",
    "we found from the classification table the type i error as @xmath35 whereas type ii error has increased to @xmath36 with overall accuracy of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the choice of thresholds for transition from bankruptcy to non - bankruptcy should be chosen with caution so that both type i and type ii errors are at minimum .",
    "even though the samples are disproportionate the algorithm  [ alg1 ] has out - performed the accuracies obtained using the altman s z - score methods .",
    "a new nonlinear transformation procedure for building a log linear model for computing the z - score is proposed .",
    "based on the new z - score ( @xmath4 ) a new indexing measure is proposed by fitting the data to a p3 distribution and then obtaining the deviations of the given dataset from the standard normal using an equi - probability transformation .",
    "the multivariate discriminate analysis ( mda ) for predicting the bankruptcy index has shown that the proposed methodology has given highest accuracy of @xmath38 which is higher by @xmath31 as compared with altman s z - score .",
    "the classification accuracies of the transformed financial ratios in predicting the bankruptcy is around @xmath39 as compared to @xmath3 obtained by using the factors of altman s procedure .",
    "the accuracies of the proposed method with p3 distribution was @xmath40 where as a model with pareto distribution resulted in an accuracy of @xmath41 .",
    "though the methodology is universal and serves as a generalized tool , there is an immense need to validate with global datasets .",
    "also , mutual interference among financial ratios is an important aspect that requires further investigation .",
    "we defer our ongoing work in this direction to a subsequent exposition .",
