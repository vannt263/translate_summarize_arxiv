    "cosmological linear perturbation theory has been remarkably successful in explaining the precision measurements of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , most notably from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) @xcite .",
    "the cmb data , combined with linear theory , have enabled us to determine many of the cosmological parameters to better than 10% accuracy @xcite .",
    "as the cmb data improve , however , it has become increasingly clear that one has to combine the cmb data with the other probes to break degeneracies between the parameters that can not be constrained very well by the cmb data alone .",
    "for example , the cmb alone can not break degeneracy between the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath5 , and matter density , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe has also been known as an excellent probe of cosmological fluctuations as well as cosmological parameters , as proven successfully by the _ two - degree field galaxy redshift survey _ ( _ 2dfgrs _ ) @xcite and the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "( _ sdss _ ) @xcite .",
    "a joint analysis of the future cmb and lss data is extremely powerful in constraining most of the cosmological parameters to better than a few percent accuracy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the lss data would allow us to constrain `` additional '' parameters such as the mass of neutrinos and the shape of the primordial power spectrum , which would remain relatively poorly constrained by the cmb data alone .",
    "the success of this approach depends on our ability to predict the power spectrum of cmb and lss from theory .",
    "linear theory provides adequate precision for cmb , as the amplitude of cmb anisotropy is only @xmath7 ; however , theory of lss has not reached to the point where one can use lss for precision cosmology at the level similar to cmb .",
    "there is a larger degree of non - linearity in lss . in order for the lss data to be as powerful as the cmb data , it is crucial that we can predict the lss power spectrum to 1% accuracy , which is nearly one order of magnitude better than the current precision .    in principle , theory of lss",
    "may be developed using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "this approach has been widely used in the literature .",
    "one method builds on the so - called hklm formalism @xcite , which interpolates between the linear regime on large scales and the stable clustering regime on small scales using a fitting function to @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the hklm method was further elaborated by @xcite .",
    "the other method builds on the so - called halo model @xcite , which was further elaborated by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "both approaches are based on _ empirical _ methods , fitting to @xmath0-body simulations mainly at @xmath8 . while these predictions may be good to within 10%",
    ", one should not expect 1% accuracy from these . also , these methods , in their current form , do not allow for non - linearity in redshift space distortion in the weakly non - linear regime , which limits their practical use for the actual data analysis .",
    "we use an alternative approach based on cosmological perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "one can calculate the next - to - leading order correction to the linear power spectrum by using 3rd - order pt @xcite .",
    "the advantage of pt is that it provides an _ exact _",
    "solution for the non - linear matter power spectrum as long as one applies it to the region in @xmath3 space where perturbative expansion is valid .",
    "( we shall call this region in @xmath3 space the `` weakly non - linear regime '' . )",
    "one still needs to use simulations to find the maximum @xmath3 below which perturbation expansion is valid , which is one of the goals of this paper .",
    "cosmological pt , including non - linear corrections to the power spectrum , was actively investigated in 1990 s ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "in particular , a lot of efforts have been devoted into understanding the non - linear power spectrum at @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that perturbation approach would not provide accurate descriptions of the power spectrum at @xmath8 due to too strong non - linearity . our results are consistent with the previous work ; however , we focus on the power spectrum at @xmath4 , where non - linearity is still modest and thus pt should perform better .",
    "our work is motivated by recent proposals of high-@xmath9 galaxy survey projects such as the _ cosmic inflation probe _ ( _ cip _ ) @xcite , _ hobby - ebery dark energy experiment _ ( _ hetdex _ ) @xcite , and _ wide - field fiber - fed multi object spectrograph _ ( _ wfmos _ ) survey @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "the goal of these missions is to measure the power spectrum of high-@xmath9 galaxies to a few percent accuracy .",
    "these missions should be able to measure the baryonic features in the power spectrum accurately .",
    "on the other hand , it has been pointed out that non - linearity would distort the baryonic features in a complex way so that it might be challenging to extract the underlying baryonic features from the observed galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we show that , as far as non - linearity in the matter power spectrum in real space is concerned , we can correct it almost exactly .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the 3rd - order pt in   2 , and describe our @xmath0-body numerical simulations in   3 .",
    "we compare the analytical predictions with simulations in   4 .",
    "we pay a particular attention to non - linearity in the baryonic acoustic oscillations .",
    "we give discussion and conclusions in ",
    "we test convergence of our results in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "we review 3rd - order pt calculations of the next - to - leading order correction to the matter power spectrum , following the pioneering work in the literature @xcite .",
    "as the power spectrum , @xmath10 , is a quadratic quantity of the density field in fourier space , @xmath11 , @xmath12 the 3rd - order expansion in the density field is necessary for obtaining the next - to - leading order correction to @xmath10 .",
    "we often use the `` dimensionless power spectrum '' , @xmath13 , which represents the contribution to the variance of density field per @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "we treat dark matter and baryons as pressureless dust particles , as we are interested in the scales much larger than the jeans length .",
    "we also assume that peculiar velocity is much smaller than the speed of light , which is always an excellent approximation , and that the fluctuations we are interested in are deep inside the horizon ; thus , we treat the system as newtonian .",
    "the basic equations to solve are given by @xmath17     = 0 , \\label{cont}\\ ] ] @xmath18 @xmath19 where the dots denote @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the conformal time ) , @xmath22 denotes @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the comoving coordinate ) , @xmath25 is the peculiar velocity field , and @xmath26 is the peculiar gravitational potential field from density fluctuations .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 is curl - free , which motivates our using @xmath28 , the velocity divergence field .",
    "using equation  ( [ poisson ] ) and the friedmann equation , we write the continuity equation [ eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) ] and the euler equation [ eq .  ( [ euler ] ) ] in fourier space as @xmath29 respectively .    to proceed further",
    ", we assume that the universe is matter dominated , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "of course , this assumption can not be fully justified , as dark energy dominates the universe at low @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that the next - to - leading order correction to @xmath32 is extremely insensitive to the underlying cosmology , if one uses the correct growth factor for @xmath11 @xcite . moreover , as we are primarily interested in @xmath33 , where the universe is still matter dominated , accuracy of our approximation is even better .",
    "( we quantify the error due to this approximation below . ) to solve these coupled equations , we shall expand @xmath11 and @xmath34 perturbatively using the @xmath35-th power of linear solution , @xmath36 , as a basis : @xmath37 here , the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 as well as their recursion relations are given in @xcite . as the linear density field , @xmath40 , is a gaussian random field , the ensemble average of odd powers of @xmath40 vanishes .",
    "therefore , the next - to - leading order correction to @xmath32 is @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 ^ 2,\\ ] ] @xmath43 @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath45 should be modified for different cosmological models , the difference vanishes when @xmath46 .",
    "the biggest correction comes from the configurations with @xmath47 , for which @xmath48 ^ 2\\simeq 1.006 $ ] and @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath33 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath51 is given by equation  ( [ eq : f2s ] ) , while @xmath52 contains corrections due to @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite , and we used @xmath55 and @xmath56 at present .",
    "the information about different background cosmology is thus almost entirely encoded in the linear growth factor .",
    "we extend the results obtained above to arbitrary cosmological models by simply replacing @xmath57 in equation  ( [ eq : next - to - leading ] ) with an appropriate linear growth factor , @xmath58 , @xmath59.\\ ] ] we shall use equation  ( [ eq : p22])([eq : next - to - leading2 ] ) to compute @xmath60 .",
    "we use the tvd @xcite code to simulate the evolution of @xmath61 .",
    "the tvd code uses the particle - mesh scheme for gravity , and the total - variation - diminishing ( tvd ) scheme for hydrodynamics , although we do not use hydrodynamics in our calculations . to increase the dynamic range of the derived power spectrum and check for convergence of the results , we use four box sizes , @xmath62 , 256 , 128 , and 64  @xmath63  mpc , with the same number of particles , @xmath64 .",
    "( we use @xmath65 meshes for doing fft . )",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath55 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "we output the simulation data at @xmath71 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 and 1 for 512 , 256 and 128  @xmath63  mpc , while only at @xmath71 , 5 , 4 and 3 for 64  @xmath63  mpc .",
    "we suppress sampling variance of the estimated @xmath60 by averaging @xmath60 from 60 , 60 , 20 , and 15 independent realizations of 512 , 256 , 128 , and 64  @xmath63  mpc simulations , respectively .",
    "we calculate the density field on @xmath65 mesh points from the particle distribution by the cloud - in - cell ( cic ) mass distribution scheme .",
    "we then fourier transform the density field and average @xmath72 within @xmath73 over the angle to estimate @xmath60 . here ,",
    "@xmath74 . finally , we correct the estimated @xmath32 for loss of power due to the cic pixelization effect using the window function calculated from 100 realizations of random particle distributions .",
    "we use the cosmics package @xcite to calculate the linear transfer function ( with linger ) and generate the input linear matter power spectrum and initial conditions ( with grafic ) .",
    "we have increased the number of sampling points for the transfer function in @xmath3 space from the default value of cosmics , as the default sampling rate is too low to sample the baryonic acoustic oscillations accurately .",
    "( the default rate resulted in an artificial numerical smoothing of the oscillations . )",
    "we locate initial particles on the regular grid ( i.e. , we do not randomize the initial particle distribution ) , and give each particle the initial velocity field using the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this procedure suppresses shot noise in the derived power spectrum , which arises from randomness of particle distribution .",
    "we have checked this by comparing @xmath60 from the initial condition to the input linear spectrum . however , some shot noise would arise as density fluctuations grow over time . while it is difficult to calculate the magnitude of shot noise from the structure formation , we estimate it by comparing @xmath60 from large - box simulations with that from small - box simulations .",
    "we do not find any evidence for shot noise at @xmath33 ; thus , we do not subtract shot noise from the estimated @xmath60 . to be conservative , we use 512 , 256 , 128 , and 64  @xmath63  mpc simulations to obtain @xmath60 at @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively , to avoid the residual cic pixelization effect and potential contaminations from unaccounted shot noise terms as well as artificial `` transients '' from initial conditions generated by the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "the initial redshifts are @xmath79 , 34 , 42 , and 50 for 512 , 256 , 128 , and 64  @xmath63  mpc simulations , respectively . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app ] we show more on the convergence test ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares @xmath60 at @xmath80 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ( from top to bottom ) from simulations ( dashed lines ) , pt ( solid lines ) , and linear theory ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the pt predictions agree with simulations so well that it is actually difficult to see the difference between pt and simulations in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the simulations are significantly above the linear theory predictions at high @xmath3 .    to facilitate the comparison better ,",
    "we show @xmath81 [ eq .  ( [ eq : deltasq ] ) ] in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we find that the pt predictions ( thin solid lines ) agree with simulations ( thick solid lines ) to better than 1% accuracy for @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "the latest predictions from halo approach @xcite ( dotted lines ) perform significantly worse then pt .",
    "this result suggests that one must use pt to model non - linearity in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "the baryonic features in the matter power spectrum provide a powerful tool to constrain the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "this method uses the fact that the cmb angular power spectrum sets the physical acoustic scale , and thus the features in the matter power spectrum seen on the sky and in redshift space may be used as the standard ruler , giving us the angular diameter distance out to the galaxy distribution at a given survey redshift as well as @xmath83 @xcite . in order for this method to be viable , however , it is crucial to understand distortion on the baryonic acoustic oscillations caused by non - linearity",
    ". this has been investigated so far mostly using direct numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite also compared the pt prediction with their @xmath0-body simulations at @xmath50 , finding that pt was a poor fit .",
    "this is because non - linearity at @xmath50 is too strong to model by pt .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that pt provides an accurate _ analytical _ account of non - linear distortion at @xmath4 : even at @xmath80 , the third peak at @xmath84 is modeled at a few percent level . at @xmath85 ,",
    "all the oscillatory features are modeled to better than 1% accuracy .",
    "a slight deficit in power from @xmath0-body simulations at @xmath86 relative to the perturbation theory predictions at @xmath87 may be due to artificial transient modes from the zeldovich approximation used to generate initial conditions .",
    "one may eliminate such an effect by either using a smaller box - size or a better initial condition from the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite . as the power spectrum at @xmath88 from 256  @xmath63  mpc simulations at @xmath87 agrees with the perturbation theory predictions very well ,",
    "we conclude that this small deficit in power at @xmath89 is a numerical effect , most likely the transients in low - resolution simulations .",
    "how do the predicted non - linear power spectra depend on the amplitude of matter fluctuations ? as the non - linear contributions to the power spectrum are given by the linear spectrum squared , a non - linear to linear ratio grows in proportion to @xmath90 . in fig  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show how the non - linear contributions increase as one increases @xmath91 from 0.7 to 1.0",
    ". this figure may be useful when one compares our results with the previous work that uses different values of @xmath91 .",
    "the next - to - leading order correction to the matter power spectrum calculated analytically from 3rd - order pt provides an almost exact description of the matter power spectrum in real space in the weakly non - linear regime , where @xmath92 ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the most important implications of our results for the planned high-@xmath9 galaxy surveys are that we can use pt to calculate ( a ) non - linearity in the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , which should reduce systematics in constraining dark energy properties , and ( b ) the matter power spectrum up to much higher @xmath3 than that was accessible before , which should vastly increase our ability to measure the shape of the primordial power spectrum as well as the mass of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "of course , these surveys measure the _ galaxy _ power spectrum in _ redshift _ space ; thus , the future work should include pt calculations of non - linearity in ( a ) redshift space distortion @xcite , and ( b ) halo biasing @xcite , as well as an extensive comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "pt also allows one to calculate the higher - order statistics such as the bispectrum , which has been shown to be a powerful tool to check for systematics in our understanding of non - linear galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "we should therefore `` reload '' cosmological perturbation theory and make a serious assessment of its validity in light of the planned high-@xmath9 galaxy surveys constraining properties of dark energy , inflation , and neutrinos .",
