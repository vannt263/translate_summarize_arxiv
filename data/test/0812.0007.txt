    "they found that galaxies with halo masses below a few 10@xmath2 m@xmath3  are dominated by `` cold '' gas accretion .",
    "this cold gas is never shock heated to the virial temperature of the galaxy , and is thought to be accreted predominantly along filaments in the cosmic web ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further support for this new paradigm has come from using a similarly large cosmological volume simulated with an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code .    for galaxy halos to shock heat infalling gas",
    ", the cooling rate of gas behind the shock must be slower than the compression rate of the infalling gas @xcite .",
    "this requirement leads to two regimes in which gas is able to avoid shock heating , and instead cools onto the galaxy on a free fall timescale instead .",
    "first , galaxies below a certain critical mass are not massive enough to support a stable shock because their dynamical time is shorter than the cooling time of the halo gas .",
    "opt08 find that the halo mass where cold and shocked accretion contribute equally is in good agreement with the theoretical analysis of , with a critical mass of 10@xmath4 m@xmath3 .",
    "this critical mass is roughly independent of redshift .",
    "second , even when a shock is present , cold gas accretion can occur along filaments that penetrate deep inside the hot halo .",
    "the ability of filaments to feed galaxy growth has been noted for some time @xcite .",
    "k05 find that their cold flow gas accretion is largely along filaments .",
    "these filaments are efficient at funneling gas to the galaxy , and can bring material to the galaxy from a much larger radius than predicted in the standard spherical accretion model . the mass contributed by filaments is a strong function of redshift ( db06 , opt08 ) .    note",
    "that in the first case above , when a galaxy is in the low mass regime incapable of supporting a stable shock , cold gas accretion can occur both in a quasi - spherical fashion and along filaments , while in the second , high mass regime in which a hot halo exists , cold gas accretion occurs primarily along preferred directions in filaments .",

    "therefore , unresolved halos with fewer than 64 dm particles should contribute little or no bound gas , and have no significant impact on the gas accretion study in this paper .",

    "before investigating the role of shocked versus unshocked gas in our simulations , we first want to identify the gas that has been accreted smoothly to our galaxy halos , as opposed to gas that has been accreted from other galaxy halos .",

    "if we had instead examined galaxies with late major mergers , they may not cross the shock threshold until low redshifts , and have even higher fractions of unshocked gas accretion .",
    "our galaxies here assemble the majority of their mass early , and then quietly accrete gas afterward , meaning that they effectively cross the mass threshold for stable shocks early .",
    "thus , by adopting galaxies with similar merger histories , we guarantee that we are comparing galaxies across a range in mass , but with other properties being similar .",
    "because of their range in final mass , each galaxy crosses the shock threshold at differing times .",
    "galaxies that cross this threshold sooner , i.e. , more massive galaxies , therefore have a longer period of time to accrete shocked gas .",
    "this extended time capable of shocking is partly responsible for the well defined trend of accreted shock fraction with increasing mass , in that these galaxies have similar histories and thus display this trend sharply .",

    "is well divided into hot / cold as well .",
    "h579 has no shocked gas , but for our two most massive galaxies , mw1 and gal1 , the two components are well separated in temperature .",
    "this separation is not altogether surprising , as part of our requirement for being identified as shocked is that the particle reach a minimum temperature ( 3/8 t@xmath13 ) as well as have a sudden entropy increase .",
    "the exception is dwf1 .",
    "while the unshocked gas extends to much lower temperatures than the hot gas , it overlaps the shocked gas .",
    "this result is due to the requirement mentioned above that the shocked entropy of the galaxy must be above the ambient , intergalactic entropy ( s@xmath35 , set by the mean baryon density and the uv temperature floor ) .",
    "dwf1 does not cross this threshold until @xmath150.6 .",
    "consequently , there exists gas that reaches temperatures above 3/8 t@xmath13 of dwf1 at higher redshifts , and is not included as shocked .",
    "it is difficult to say immediately whether this gas _ should _ be counted as shocked gas .",
    "note that even the two most massive galaxies , which are capable of supporting a shock over basically their entire traced histories , include a portion of gas that reached high temperatures ( above a few 10@xmath9 k ) yet is labeled as unshocked because it does not undergo a strong entropy increase .",
    "previous works on this subject have attempted to identify shocked and unshocked gas by using only a temperature cut ( e.g. , k05 and opt08 used a cut of 2.5@xmath510@xmath9 k ) . in that case , our hot , unshocked gas would have been included as shocked gas .",
    "we will investigate this alternative definition to search for hot and cold flows later in the discussion ( section  [ temp ] ) .    despite the small inclusion of hot gas in the unshocked definition",
    ", we find that our definitions do an excellent job of separating gas spatially , into gas accreted along preferred directions in filaments ( unshocked ) and gas accreted from a more spherical distribution ( shocked ) .",

    "[ highz ] is the clear distinction in spatial distribution at these high redshifts , before most of the gas has been accreted .",
    "the unshocked gas is collapsing into filaments that are feeding the galaxy s growth .",
    "because these filaments are capable of penetrating deep inside the virial radius , this cold gas is being delivered much closer to the galaxy disk ( see also section [ adiabatic ] , and hence appears to occupy a smaller spatial scale than the shocked gas .",

    "this delay in star formation for the shocked gas is not surprising . as this gas reaches higher temperatures ( and entropies ) , it has much longer cooling times , slowing the rate at which it can cool to the disk and form stars . as the galaxy grows in time and reaches even higher virial temperatures , the radius at which shocking occurs increases ( discussed further in section  [ adiabatic ] ) .",
    "this increase in shock radius will potentially make later accretion to the disk even more difficult , due to even longer cooling times .",

    "the delay between accretion and star formation includes both the cooling time of the gas particle onto the disk , the natural time the gas might spend in the disk before producing stars , and subsequent delays in sf due to feedback processes in the disk , which vary as a function of galaxy mass @xcite . in the two lowest mass galaxies , the delay time for unshocked gas is typically longer than for our two highest mass galaxies ( 3 - 4 gyr rather than 1 - 2 gyr ) due to the increasing importance of feedback effects at lower masses .",

    "we investigate the change at 12x the original step interval used above ( i.e. , fine sampling corresponds to @xmath027 myr resolution per output ) .",
    "when using our standard step interval , the smooth gas makes up 73% of all the gas accreted by galaxy h277 over the history of the trace . by increasing the output interval resolution by a factor of 12 ,",
    "the gas identified as smoothly accreted declines , so that it composes 66% of all the gas accretion over the galaxy s history , for a total decline of 7% .",
    "thus , by definition , the fraction of gas accreted as `` clumpy '' over the galaxy s history must increase by 7% .",

    "the amount of gas in these spikes identified as `` smooth '' decreases in our fine time step limit , but the spikes still remain , suggesting we are still missing some gas in mergers . by generously estimating the mass of gas contributing to these accretion spikes , we find that we are missing only an additional 1% of clumpy gas accretion .",
    "thus , we agree with previous studies that find that the majority of gas mass is accreted smoothly rather than in mergers .",
    "next , we use the `` smooth '' particles identified in the standard output resolution ( 320 myr outputs , where smooth gas accounts for 73% of all the gas accreted over the history of the galaxy ) to isolate the effect of output interval on the fraction of particles identified as shocked . at finer step intervals , the fraction of smooth gas that is shocked increases by 2.3% .",
    "this increase is quite small , and occurs primarily at @xmath12 @xmath8 2 , likely to due to the fact that we do not adequately sample cooling times at high redshift . to verify this , we calculated the instantaneous cooling rates for particles in an annulus between 30 - 40 kpc ( as close to the disk as we trace them ) and inside 10 kpc of r@xmath13 at each of our `` standard '' analysis intervals .",
    "for h277 , the virial radius does not reach 30 kpc until @xmath12 = 2.65 , and the cooling times of the particles within r@xmath13 are lower than our standard step resolution of 320 myr until this redshift .",
    "after this redshift , however , the galaxy grows quickly and the cooling times are longer than our output intervals , so that we are capable of easily identifying shocked gas .",

    "however , because dwf1 is not massive enough to support a stable shock until @xmath12 @xmath00.6 , our time step undersampling at high @xmath12 has no impact on our resulting fraction of shocked gas . for mw1 and gal1",
    ", we can expect about a 5% change , as we found in h277 , and perhaps less since we resolve their cooling times to higher redshift than in the h277 case .    as an interesting note ,",

    "our uv background is capable of ionizing much of the hydrogen gas in the halo of this galaxy , causing it to be inefficient at cooling .",
    "we verified that turning off our uv background lowers the instantaneous cooling times substantially , by almost an order of magnitude @xcite .      by definition ,",

    "thus , there is some concern that sph will do a poor job of resolving shocks .",
    "gasoline adopts the standard sph artificial viscosity formulation @xcite , with a correction to detect and reduce viscous transport in shearing regions @xcite . @xcite",
    "investigated gasoline s performance in this area with both the standard @xcite shock tube test , and a spherical adiabatic collapse test @xcite .",
    "it was found that gasoline does an excellent job of matching the analytic solutions to within a few particle separations , and matches the post - shock entropy values very well .",
    "it can be possible for low numerical resolution to artificially broaden shocks ( due to entropy generated by the artificial viscosity used in sph ) , allowing gas to radiate energy while passing through a shock rather than heating and undergoing an entropy jump @xcite .",
    "this broadening is unlikely to be an issue at the high resolutions used here @xcite , but we verified numerical convergence by using a lower resolution version of our mw1 run , mw1.lo , and performing the same analysis .",
    "this run has 1/8 of the mass resolution and 1/2 the force resolution of mw1 ( and is the same galaxy discussed in detail in * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ accr ] demonstrates that the shocked fraction in this run is in excellent agreement with mw1 .",
    "since our shock definition includes a temperature criterion , this implies that we are not missing high temperature gas , and thus that we have a sufficient numerical resolution to identify entropy jumps and are not missing heating in shocks .",
    "hence , our cold flow gas accretion is not an artifact of numerical resolution .",
    "previous groups who have attempted to investigate the role of cold flows in galaxy gas accretion have used a different criterion to identify shocked and unshocked gas , adopting a strict temperature cutoff .",
    "we examine in this section how our results differ if we use the same temperature definition as other authors .",
    "k05 and opt08 have noted that the temperature distribution of accreted particles can be bimodal , with a minimum at 2.5@xmath510@xmath9 k. they use this minimum to separate gas into cold accretion and hot accretion modes .",
    "we also see this minimum in the temperature distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mwhist ] for our mw1 galaxy .",
    "this figure shows the maximum temperature of gas particles that have been accreted to the galaxy between successive redshift intervals . up until @xmath12 = 0.5",
    ", there is a strong bimodality .",
    "the dashed vertical line shows the separation at 2.5@xmath510@xmath9 k used by k05 , k08 , and opt08 .",
    "our accreted gas particles clearly demonstrate this same minimum .",
    "these two groups have previously noted that this minimum is a function of the cooling curve , and has therefore has little direct relation to the actual modes of hot or cold accretion .",
    "however , it is a convenient point at which to separate the gas into hot or cold accretion modes .    to assess",
    "how our results are affected by these definitions , we repeat the above analysis to identify shocked gas in our smoothly accreted gas component , using the temperature criterion of k05 and opt08 .",
    "the same set of smoothly accreted particles is used , so that the only change between the two definitions will be in the resulting shocked or unshocked fraction ( or , more appropriately , hot and cold fraction ) .",
    "the difference resulting from these two separate definitions is remarkably small .",
    "the temperature criterion leads to slightly more hot gas being accreted to the galaxy than shocked gas , but the largest difference is only 7% , in the case of gal1 .",
    "the remaining galaxies have differences of 3% or less .",
    "h579 never reaches the temperature cutoff identified by k05 , and thus both studies agree than it has never accreted shocked / hot gas .",
    "these tests lead us to conclude that the two different definitions yield very similar results .",
    "this agreement may be partly due to the fact that we also impose some sort of temperature criterion ( requiring that our gas not only undergo an entropy increase , but reach 3/8 t@xmath13 as well ) . however , this result was not guaranteed .",
    "we emphasize that the temperature criterion alone is based on the physics of the cooling curve , and does not reflect the physics of the gas accretion shocks .",
    "hence , we choose to add an entropy criterion to our definition , as it is unique to each galaxy halo and the physics of the various accretion modes .",
    "@xcite found that the mass function of our galaxies is resolved down to a minimum of 64 dm particles .",
    "for the runs used here , that corresponds to total halo masses of 8.1@xmath510@xmath10 m@xmath3 , 6.1@xmath510@xmath10 m@xmath3 , 4.9@xmath510@xmath41 m@xmath3 , and 1.9@xmath510@xmath42 m@xmath3  for h579 , dwf1 , mw1 , and gal1 , respectively .",
    "these masses are well below the limit where the uv field will suppress galaxy formation @xcite , and thus we avoid issues due to sub - resolution merging .",
    "that is , there should be no unresolved halos that are being counted incorrectly as `` smooth '' accretion .",
    "this assertion was verified by running the same analysis on a lower resolution version of our mw1 galaxy , mw1.lo , with a mass resolution of 1.9@xmath510@xmath42 m@xmath3  at 64 dm particles .",
    "this mass is just below the limit that the uv field should suppress galaxy formation .",
    "indeed , the smooth gas fraction agrees to within a few percent with mw1 ( see table  [ accr ] ) .",
    "mw1.lo does have a five percent higher fraction of smooth accretion , but given fluctuations in the simulations , this is excellent agreement .",
    "the dominant effect of the uv background in our simulations is to suppress galaxy formation at low masses , and hence lower the amount of clumpy accretion .",
    "gas which would have otherwise been in small halos is now free to be smoothly accreted to our galaxies .",
    "this was confirmed by running mw1.lo with the uv background off ( and cooling and sf turned off as well ) .",
    "the results for this galaxy , mw1.ad , are shown in table  [ accr ] .",
    "it is clear from the first two columns that the amount of `` clumpy '' accretion material increases from about 20% to about 50% .",
    "this confirms that our uv background is partly responsible for reducing the amount of gas accreted from other halos , and hence increasing the amount of gas available for smooth accretion .",
    "the more interesting effect of the uv background is on the amount of shocked gas accretion to the galaxy .",
    "our uv background ( in combination with the mean baryonic density of the universe as a function of redshift ) sets a temperature floor in the igm , and hence an entropy floor for igm gas . for a galaxy to be capable of shocking accreted gas ,",
    "the virial entropy of the galaxy halo must be above this background entropy by a certain factor .",
    "hence , based on our definitions , the uv background sets a minimum halo mass that will be able to shock , as function of time .",
    "@xcite and db06 showed that the shock radius in the case of adiabatic accretion ( i.e. , no cooling ) is well matched to the virial radius in a spherically symmetric case .",
    "they also demonstrated that when cooling is turned on , the same galaxy is not initially massive enough to support a stable shock , so that accreted gas shocks at the disk of the assembling galaxy . only after a critical mass",
    "is reached can the galaxy support a shock .",
    "we have again used mw1.ad with the uv background , cooling , and sf turned off ( i.e. , the adiabatic case ) to test these results . as noted above , the amount of smooth accretion drops for mw1.ad , as much of the gas is able to remain bound to its dark matter halo . however , from table  [ accr ] ( last two columns ) it is clear that the amount of smooth gas accretion that is shocked also increases in this case , increasing to 84% .",
    "this behavior is expected , and is similar to the standard spherical model in which all gas gets heated to the virial temperature of the galaxy as it is accreted .",
    "the fact that there is unshocked gas at all is due to the fact that this simulation is not spherically symmetric , and filaments of cold gas still exist that are capable of penetrating well inside of the halo without shocking .",
    "[ shockcomp ] shows the radii at which particles are shocked inside of r@xmath13 , as a function of time , for the mw1.lo and adiabatic , mw1.ad , runs .",
    "contours are used for clarity , with black representing the least dense concentration of particles , and white peaks the most dense .",
    "the solid lines show the virial radii of the galaxies as a function of time .",
    "the main difference between the two runs is at high redshift . in the adiabatic case , particles are able to shock inside the virial radius even at high @xmath12 , while in the mw1.lo run there is no shocking at the highest redshifts .",
    "shocks begin to occur near the disk at redshift 4 , and shocked particles fill the space between the disk and the virial radius at lower redshifts . the radius with the highest concentration of shocked particles moves outward with time in both cases .",
    "metal line cooling has recently been added to gasoline ( shen et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "mw1.lo was rerun with metal cooling on , to find if the new cooling has any effect on the results here .",
    "however , the smoothly accreted gas ( be it shocked or unshocked ) has nearly primordial metallicities , and the resulting fractions of shocked and unshocked accreted gas are identical to the results for mw1.lo with only h and he cooling . likewise",
    ", the fraction of disk stars formed from shocked and unshocked gas is also identical to mw1.lo .",
    "we have tracked the history of gas accreted to four high resolution disk galaxies that span two orders of magnitude in galaxy mass .",
    "for all of these galaxies , early disk growth can be predominantly attributed to cold gas , and up to milky way masses the sf of the stellar disk is dominated by unshocked , cold flow gas accretion at essentially all times .",
    "this dominance of cold gas in the formation of disk stars can exist even when the the majority of gas accreting to the virial radius is being shocked and reaching high temperatures . at galaxy masses above l@xmath1 , an early phase of disk growth prior to @xmath12 = 1 can be attributed to the presence of cold gas accretion .",
    "we have examined gas temperature histories in relation to the virial temperature of the halo that they are accreted to .",
    "while the shocked component is capable of reaching temperatures near the virial temperature of the halo , the unshocked component of gas accretion remains below 3/8 of the virial temperature at all times .",
    "the important role of unshocked , cold flow gas in the growth of galaxies is consistent with previous studies that adopt an explicit temperature cutoff , determined by the cooling curve , to identify cold flow gas .",
    "we confirm that the ability of smoothly accreted gas to shock is a strong function of mass .",
    "however , our focus here has been to study the subsequent role of this cold gas accretion in the growth of stellar disks . because the unshocked gas does not reach the same high temperatures as shocked gas",
    ", it is capable of cooling to the disk faster and forming stars .",
    "it is important to note that this early cooling of unshocked gas to the disk is not a manifestation of the historic `` overcooling '' problem .",
    "this can be seen by examining the results from our stellar mass - metallicity relationship , which matches the observed relation at both low and high redshifts @xcite . as discussed by both @xcite and @xcite , this match",
    "is achieved by overcoming the overcooling problem with both high resolution and a physically motivated sn feedback model .",
    "previous works consistently produced metallicities too high when compared to observations at high @xmath12 , due to overcooling and a rapid consumption of gas and subsequent metal enrichment .",
    "instead , our sn feedback scheme regulates the sfrs of our galaxies , preventing them from too quickly consuming their gas .",
    "the early sf seen in our more massive galaxies is due instead to the accretion of cold gas that can cool rapidly to the disk to form stars .    despite running our simulations in a fully cosmological context that includes galaxy mergers ,",
    "the dominant gas supply is from smoothly accreted gas that has never belonged to another galaxy halo . for a milky way mass galaxy with a quiescent merging history like the galaxies shown here ,",
    "only @xmath025% of the accreted gas is acquired from other galaxy halos , resulting in a similar fraction of the disk stars forming from this gas .",
    "it is our goal to assess the impact that cold flow gas accretion may have in altering current models of disk galaxy formation .",
    "a direct comparison with semi - analytic models is difficult to do and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "current sams include the possibility of rapid gas cooling for low mass galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested that this regime is similar to the cold flow gas accretion seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed comparison of the galics sam @xcite to the sph results of k05 , and found that the cold gas accretion rates in the two schemes were in agreement .",
    "this implies that the amount of cold gas currently available in sams may agree well with simulations , though this needs to be confirmed with further comparisons .",
    "however , the results in this paper may emphasize a separate problem within the cold flow regime . even in the case of rapid cooling in sams ,",
    "the temperature of the gas is initially set to the virial temperature of the galaxy halo , and cooling times are based on this assumption .",
    "prior to the development of a hot halo , the free fall time determines when the gas reaches the disk in either the sams or the simulations .",
    "however , sams do not yet model the impact of filaments on galaxy growth .",
    "our two most massive galaxies , which are able to develop a hot halo at high redshifts ( 4 to 6 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are still capable of accreting cold gas that never approaches the virial temperature of the halo in filaments at high @xmath12 .",
    "these filaments allow a significant amount of cold gas mass to accumulate inside of the galaxy , even for massive galaxies capable of supporting a shock at early times .",
    "this cold gas cools quickly to the disk to form stars .",
    "this rapid settling to the disk allows for the building of stellar disks at higher redshifts than predicted if all gas is heated to the virial temperature , as in the standard model .",
    "we have shown that the discrepancy in temperatures between the shocked and unshocked gas components leads to significantly longer cooling times for the shocked gas ( note that their densities will be discrepant as well , since most of the unshocked component are found in dense filaments , exacerbating the difference in cooling times ) .",
    "if the unshocked gas had reached the virial temperature , the star formation rates in the disk would have been delayed ( in the cases shown here , until after @xmath12 = 1 ) .",
    "a study of the angular momentum content of the accreted gas will be examined in future work , but the presence of cold flow gas accretion , particularly in filaments in massive halos , allows for the building of large , massive disks at high @xmath12 , in agreement with observations .",
