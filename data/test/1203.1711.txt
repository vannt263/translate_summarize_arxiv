    "in telecommunication , radar and other fields of electronic engineering , it is usually of great concern about multiband signals , which consist of several narrowband signals modulated by different carrier frequencies .",
    "to acquire such a signal , a common practical method @xcite is to demodulate the narrowband signals by their carrier frequencies to baseband , respectively .",
    "after low - pass filtered to reject frequencies from other bands , the narrowband signals are converted to digital samples at rate corresponding to their actual bandwidths .",
    "thus each band is acquired separately and the total sampling rate is the sum of the bandwidths .",
    "this method can reach the minimal sampling rate while the carrier frequencies must be known a priori .",
    "when the carrier frequencies are unknown , efficient sampling of the multiband signal is a challenging task because the nyquist frequency of the signal may exceed the capability of the up - to - date analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) . in this scenario ,",
    "several sub - nyquist sampling strategies have been proposed to handle this challenge . in @xcite and @xcite , a scheme called multicoset sampling",
    "is proposed to perform analog - to - digital conversion at low rate , but knowledge of the frequency support must be known for recovery .",
    "periodic nonuniform sampling is another sub - nyquist sampling strategy where several adcs are applied to form a high sampling rate for the multiband signal @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) has been raised and developed to recover sparse signals from far fewer samples @xcite . due to the fact that multiband signal is sparse in frequency domain ,",
    "several novel analog - to - digital architectures have been designed based on cs theory . in random demodulator @xcite ,",
    "the original signal is multiplied by a pseudorandom sequence , integrated and sampled at sub - nyquist rate . in the recovery stage ,",
    "cs algorithms are performed to recover the original signal from these samples .",
    "the modulated wideband converter ( mwc ) @xcite is another cs - based sub - nyquist sampling system .",
    "it also consists of two stages : sampling , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and reconstruction . in the sampling stage ,",
    "modulated sampling is conducted by mixers and lowpass filters in multiple channels . in the reconstruction stage ,",
    "sparsity constraint algorithms are applied to recover the original signal from the multiple observations .",
    "the sampling rate @xmath3 and the frequency @xmath4 of the periodic mixing function @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 with odd @xmath0 , which is a strategy collapsing @xmath0 channels to a single one .",
    "the strategy allows designers to trade off between sampling rate and the number of hardware devices .",
    "recent researches focused on this system include a calibration system with simple structure and low computational complexity to obtain actual measurement matrix @xcite .        in order to fully use the accuracy of an adc",
    ", the quantization reference voltage is an essential parameter to consider about .",
    "the reference voltage of an conventional adc simply equals the maximum value of the input analog signal . in the mwc",
    ", however , the quantization takes place at the end of the sampling stage and the maximum of the samples is sensitive to several parameters , especially the randomness of the mixing functions .",
    "thus the reference voltage can not be derived from the input signal intuitively .",
    "moreover , simulation results exploit that the maximum of the samples varies widely even when the input signal is fixed .",
    "therefore , an improper reference voltage may have a severe impact on the performance of the whole system .",
    "though important in practice , few researches have been focused on this problem and the reference voltage in practical implementation is obtained by experiments .",
    "this paper aims to theoretically study the reference voltage of quantizer in the mwc .",
    "a reasonable method to acquire reference voltage is proposed . by analyzing the input signal under several assumptions",
    ", we draw the conclusion that the reference voltage is proportional to the square root of the collapse parameter @xmath7 .",
    "further discussions show that the assumptions made in the analysis are acceptable and that the conclusion is valid for arbitrary multiband signals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly introduces the structure of the mwc and related mathematical expressions .",
    "section 3 studies the reference voltage and come to the conclusion under rational assumptions .",
    "the theoretical results in section 3 are numerically validated in section 4 .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the input signal @xmath8 enters @xmath9 channels simultaneously . in the @xmath10-th channel",
    ", it is multiplied by a @xmath11-periodic pseudorandom sequence @xmath5 , whose frequency is @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 is chosen as a piecewise constant function that randomly alternates between the levels @xmath13 for each of @xmath14 equal time intervals .",
    "the mixed signal is then truncated by an ideal lowpass filter with cutoff @xmath15 .",
    "finally , the filtered signal @xmath16 is sampled at rate @xmath17 . according to @xcite , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfy @xmath6 with odd @xmath0 .",
    "further assume that @xmath8 is bandlimited to @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 is much larger than the total sampling rate of the system .",
    "formally , the mathematical description of @xmath5 is @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 for every @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath5 is @xmath11-periodic , it has the fourier expansion @xmath24 where @xmath25 are fourier coefficients .",

    "we first consider about a basic scenario where the signal is only composed of one modulated narrowband signal , and then discuss about arbitrary multiband signals . in the sequel ,",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath31 , consists of two symmetric bands centered at @xmath32 respectively , where @xmath33 .",

    ", the sampling stage can be simplified to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] when reference voltage is being analyzed . for convenience , in the sequel",
    ", the subscript @xmath10 which denotes the channel number is omitted .",
    "for the basic scenario ( [ eq2 ] ) , the series on the right side of ( [ eq1 ] ) have only @xmath38 nonzero terms .",

    "hence @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the analytic signal of @xmath8 .",
    "dealing with the second term on the right side of ( [ eq4 ] ) in the same way , it can be derived that @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes the real part of its argument .",
    "the reference voltage is determined by the maximum value of @xmath57 .",
    "define @xmath58 as the maximum value of @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath59 is a random variable , due to the fact that the mixing function @xmath60 randomly alternates between @xmath13 .",
    "mathematically , ( [ eq6 ] ) indicates that the randomness of @xmath59 results from the randomness of @xmath61 , which are fourier coefficients of @xmath60 .",
    "the threshold of @xmath58 is chosen such that the probability @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "it is reasonable to use @xmath64 as reference voltage with a proper @xmath63 , say @xmath65 .",
    "the following proposition reveals the property of the reference voltage defined as ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "[ pro1 ] in the mwc mentioned above , consider fixed input signal ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "further assume + ( a ) @xmath57 and @xmath66 reach their maximum at the same time ; + ( b ) @xmath67 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with uniform distribution on @xmath68 $ ] , and @xmath69 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables independent from @xmath67 .",
    "then the reference voltage @xmath64 defined by ( [ eq7 ] ) is proportional to @xmath70 .",

    ". random variables . according to central limit theorem @xcite , the variable @xmath88 satisfies standard normal distribution when @xmath0 approaches infinity .",
    "hence @xmath89 where @xmath90 . combining ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) ,",
    "it is obvious that @xmath74 is a constant satisfying @xmath91 thus @xmath92 and this completes the proof .",
    "assumption ( a ) is drawn from the mechanism of the system .",
    "mapping ( [ eq2 ] ) to time domain , one has @xmath93 .",
    "thus @xmath94 equation ( [ eq11 ] ) shows that @xmath95 and @xmath96 reach the maximum at the same time . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath97 is obtained through three steps from @xmath98 : modulated by @xmath99 with large @xmath100 typically , multiplied by @xmath60 and lowpass filtered . in the first step , modulation with the carrier at high frequency can hardly change the instant when the signal reaches the maximum .",
    "the second step does not make any change because @xmath101 .",
    "for the last step , since @xmath102 , the lowpass filter does not affect the `` envelope '' of the signal .",
    "based on the analysis above , it is convincing that @xmath103 and @xmath104 also reach the maximum at the same time , which leads to assumption ( a ) .    assumption ( b )",
    "is based on the observation of @xmath105 . considering ( [ eq12 ] ) , since @xmath106 is far larger than @xmath0 , one has @xmath107 , which results in the approximation that @xmath108 are i.i.d .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of @xmath80 is determined mainly by the sum of @xmath109 . in the complex plane",
    ", @xmath110 represents @xmath14 points located uniformly on the unit circle and @xmath14 is typically very large .",
    "therefore assume that the argument of their linear combination satisfies uniform distribution is an acceptable way to simplify the analysis .",
    "now we discuss about arbitrary multiband signals .",
    "consider a multiband signal @xmath97 which consists of @xmath2 basic signals denoted by ( [ eq2 ] ) with the same maximum value .",
    "if there is no overlap in time domain among these @xmath2 signals , the problem can be reduced to study one input signal .",
    "when @xmath2 signals reach their maximum at the same time , say @xmath111 , the following analysis intuitively shows that the reference voltage is proportional to @xmath112 . in frequency domain , according to ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath45 $ ] has @xmath0 shift copy of each band .",
    "thus , observing the multiband signal within a short time interval around @xmath111 , the energy of @xmath113 is @xmath1 times the energy of each basic signal .",
