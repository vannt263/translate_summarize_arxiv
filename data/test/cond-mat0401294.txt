    "the issue of metamagnetism in itinerant electron systems was studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite long ago .",
    "recently , the investigation of metamagnetism in two compounds , @xcite and @xcite , has revived interest in this phenomenon , considering it from a new point of view .",
    "it has been suggested that these systems might display a new type of quantum criticality , connected with a so - called quantum critical end point ( ) , in the vicinity of which the landau fermi - liquid theory of metals breaks down .",
    "in fact the field initiating the metamagnetic transition , the abrupt increase of the magnetisation , defines a line of first - order transitions in the field ( h)-temperature ( t ) plane without any symmetry - breaking .",

    "we present a model which gives rise to a of the above kind , which we will discuss within a simple hartree - fock theory .",
    "this model is based on a system with a single , two - dimensional electron band where the fermi level is close to a van hove singularity ( ) .",
    "our results for the magnetisation as a function of field , temperature and the band filling are in qualitative agreement with observed properties of the two- and three - layer ruthenate compounds @xcite , and suggest that the general magnetic phase diagram of -layer ruthenates might be understood in terms of band - structure properties .",

    "second , the entropy at low temperatures does not decrease monotonously with the magnetisation , but has a maximum at a finite .",

    "( [ mmcond ] ) is satisfied , for all . in fact , is not analytic at the specific value of where one of the fermi levels crosses the .",
    "despite its simplicity , our model yields a complex mean - field phase diagram . in fig .",

    "the reason for this behaviour lies in the entropy anomaly discussed above .",

    "for example , the quantum phase transition as a function of at occurs at , whereas the stoner criterion would give a slightly smaller value ,",
    ". a metastable ferromagnetic state , which is present in the paramagnetic region close to the first - order transition , gives rise to a first - order transition in an external magnetic field .",

    "with increasing separation from the van hove filling , the critical point moves rapidly to lower temperatures and higher fields .",
    "finally , the line of critical endpoints reaches zero temperature , thus giving rise to a at the point .",
    "the low - temperature limit is more involved .",
    "in fact , the equation must be replaced at zero temperature by the requirement that one of the two spin bands , for example the spin - down band , is at van hove filling , _",

    "accessing this point would require a magnetic field in the order of 200 tesla , and even if such enormous fields could be created , the metamagnetic behaviour ( _ i.e. _ the anomaly in ) is negligible .",

    ", a first - order magnetic transition can be found at a small but finite field .",
    "a metastable magnetic phase also exists in the absence of the external field .",
    "true equilibrium ferromagnetism is established only at intermediate temperatures , and there is a second - order phase transition towards a high - temperature paramagnetic state .    for , the system is in the metamagnetic regime . at low temperatures",
    "there is a first - order metamagnetic transition .",
    "both the critical field of this transition and the size of the magnetisation jump are decreasing functions of the temperature .",

    "in view of the metamagnetic behaviour of the multi - layer strontium - ruthenates ( the layered perovskite compounds ) , it is natural to concentrate on the electronic band which is related to the -band of the single - layer compound .",
    "this band , which originates from the 4 orbitals of , lies close to a .",
    "the double - layer compound has a modified band structure which preserves two bands with the basic -band structure .",
    "band structure calculations suggest that one band is moved closer to the @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that this trend of approaching the in one band progresses with increasing number of layers in each unit cell , so that is a tuning parameter for the variable in one of the bands .",
    "other aspects , such as a possible change in the ratio between the bandwidth and the coulomb repulsion or more complex multi - band physics , are neglected .",
    "in fact a phase diagram very similar to fig .  [ phasediag ] , where the filling parameter is replaced by the pressure , was proposed on purely phenomenological grounds in relation to @xcite . for a given compound , may also be tuned by external pressure or by chemical pressure , such as the gradual replacement of sr by the smaller isoelectronic ion ca .",

    "we would like to emphasise that the basic , qualitative properties of the double- and triple - layer compounds are in good agreement with our model calculation .",
    "our choice of parameters even yields values of temperature and magnetic field which are of the same order of magnitude as those found in experiment . from our calculations",
    ", we expect that a first - order metamagnetic transition should be found at sufficiently low temperatures in , but given the rapid decrease of as a function of , the required temperature is likely to be much smaller than that attained in the experiment .",
    "we stress that in our model the occurs when one band is at the van hove filling .",
    "this circumstance may influence unconventional transport properties in the vicinity of the @xcite , for non - fermi - liquid behaviour has been suggested as one consequence of an itinerant electron band being at the van hove filling @xcite .    instead of increasing the number of layers , an alternative approach to the",
    "may be through electron doping of the single - layer compound .",
    "this was attempted recently by partial replacement of by @xcite .",
    "the experimental result indeed shows an enhanced magnetic response as a function of doping , but neither ferromagnetism nor the typical temperature dependence of the susceptibility , with a maximum at finite temperature , was observed .",
    "the question of the extend to which the doping may lead to an increase in the itinerant electron density remains to be answered .",
    "if the additional electrons remain essentially localised around the dopants , this may yield a similarly enhanced , almost curie - like , susceptibility @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a mean - field theory of uniform magnetism for a single band of itinerant electrons which is close to a . the resulting phase diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , features first- and second - order ferromagnetic transitions , as well as a line of ( metamagnetic ) critical endpoints , which is pushed to zero temperature at a .",
    "such a phase diagram has been proposed on purely phenomenological grounds in the context of @xcite and multi - layer ruthenates @xcite , but no microscopic description has yet been provided . despite its simplicity",
    "our model calculation gives a good qualitative description of the magnetic properties of two- and three - layer ruthenates @xcite .",
    "the general magnetic behaviour of these materials may thus be explained in terms of band - structure properties .",
    "a similar scenario applies to , where the fermi energy is likely to be associated with a dip in the electron dos , and to , which exhibits a transition from a small - gap semiconductor to a metallic ferromagnet with increasing @xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals the remarkable aspect that the is characterised by the situation in which the chemical potential of one of the bands ( minority- or majority - spin ) is exactly at the van hove filling .",
    "this should have non - trivial consequences for the metallic properties close to the .",
    "in particular , transport properties may show non - fermi - liquid behaviour @xcite , similar to the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "finally , we comment that , although the model we have presented captures many of the qualitiative features observed in multi - layer ruthenates , it remains a relatively crude simplification .",
    "here we have neglected several aspects , including multi - band effects , spin - orbit coupling and disorder effects , which undoubtedly have a certain role in real materials .",
    "one of the most important questions concerns the effects of spin fluctuations , which are neglected within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "these aspects are the subject of current studies .",
