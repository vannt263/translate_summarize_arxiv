    "since the seminal contributions of rayleigh , einstein , smoluchowski , langevin and others @xcite , stochastic processes have been used to model physical phenomena in which fluctuations play an essential role .",
    "examples include the brownian motion of a particle , the fluctuation of current in a resistor , and the radioactive decay of subatomic particles @xcite .",
    "a central problem is to infer the parameters of the process from partially observed sample paths , for instance , the diffusion constant from a time series of positions , or the resistance from a time series of current measurements , and so on .",
    "bayesian inference provides a principled solution to this inverse problem @xcite , making optimal use of the information contained in the partially observed sample path @xcite .    the motion of a brownian particle harmonically trapped in optical tweezers in a volume of a viscous fluid far away from walls is usually modelled by the ornstein - uhlenbeck stochastic process @xcite .",
    "the stiffness @xmath0 of the harmonic potential , the friction @xmath1 of the particle , and the temperature @xmath2 of the fluid are the three parameters of the stochastic dynamics . for spherical particles stokes law",
    "@xmath3 relates the friction to the particle radius @xmath4 and the fluid viscosity @xmath5 , while the einstein relation , which holds generally , relates the particle diffusion coefficient @xmath6 to the temperature and friction through @xmath7 @xcite . of these several physical parameters ,",
    "any _ two _ may be chosen independently , and it is conventional to choose the ratio @xmath8 and @xmath6 to be independent as they relate , respectively , to the mean regression rate @xmath9 and the volatility @xmath10 of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( see below ) .",
    "reliable estimation of the stiffness is a necessary first step in using tweezers for force measurements .",
    "an estimation of the friction , for a particle of known size , provides an indirect measure of the viscosity of the medium .",
    "this microscopic method of viscometry is of great utility when sample volumes are in the nanoliter range and conventional viscometric methods can not be used .",
    "conversely , an estimate of the friction in a fluid of known viscosity provides a method for estimating the particle size . in both these cases ,",
    "an estimate of the diffusion coefficient provides , by virtue of the einstein relation , identical information .",
    "extant protocols for estimating these parameters from discrete observations of the position of the brownian particle can be divided into `` fluctuation '' and `` response '' categories . in the fluctuational methods ,",
    "the fluctuating position of the particle is recorded and the known forms of the static and dynamic correlation functions are fitted to the data . in response methods ,",
    "external perturbations are applied to the particle and the known forms of the average response is fitted to the data .",
    "considerable care is needed in these fitting procedures to obtain reliable estimates @xcite .    in recent work @xcite",
    ", bayesian inference has been applied to the optical tweezer parameter estimation problem .",
    "the posterior probability distribution of the stiffness and diffusion coefficient is estimated for a time series of positions , making it a method of the `` fluctuation '' category .",
    "monte carlo sampling is needed to compute the posterior distribution and estimation from a time series of @xmath11 points requires few tens of seconds .",
    "the advantages of the bayesian method over conventional calibration methods have been discussed at length in this work .    in this paper",
    ", we present two bayesian methods , of the fluctuational category , which do not require monte carlo sampling and , consequently , are extremely fast . for example",
    ", they estimate the trap stiffness and diffusion coefficient from time series containing a million points in less than a millisecond .",
    "the first method extracts information exploiting the markov property of the sample path and jointly estimates the mean regression rate @xmath8 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "the second method extracts information from the equal - time fluctuations of the position , which , in equilibrium , can not depend on the friction coefficient , and is , then , a function of the stiffness @xmath0 alone .",
    "in essence , this is a recasting of the `` equipartition '' method in the language of bayesian inference .",
    "the first method , in addition to inheriting the generic advantages of bayesian inference that have already been pointed out in @xcite , has several specific advantages .",
    "first , it uses the exact expression for the likelihood , which is valid for any @xmath12 , the interval at which the position is observed .",
    "therefore , it works reliably with data acquired at low frequencies .",
    "second , the exact likelihood is expressed in terms of four sufficient statistics , which are quadratic functions of the positions .",
    "their use greatly reduces the computation needed to evaluate the posterior distribution , as four numbers , rather than a large time series now represents the entire information relevant to inference .",
    "finally , we are able to obtain exact maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimates of the mean regression and diffusion coefficients , and their error bars , in terms of the four sufficient statistics .",
    "this obviates the need for the monte carlo sampling or numerical minimization steps usually required in bayesian inference .",
    "bayesian credible regions are easily calculated from the analytically obtained error bars .",
    "the second method is different from the conventional equipartition method in that it provides a bayesian error bar , representing a bayesian credible interval , rather than a frequentist confidence interval @xcite .",
    "the combined use of exact likelihoods , sufficient statistics and analytical map estimates yields both speed and accuracy in parameter estimation .",
    "we apply both methods to experimental data and obtain map estimates and error bars that are in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "these estimates are found to be in good agreement with the commonly used power spectral density calibration method @xcite .",
    "the bayesian methods of this paper are implemented in a well - documented , open - source software freely available on github @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we recall several key properties of the sample paths and distributions of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process . in section [ sec : bayesian - inference ] , we present the bayesian methods , in section [ sec : experimental - setup - and ] we describe the experimental setup , and in section [ sec : results ] we apply the bayesian procedures to the experimental data . we conclude with a discussion of future directions in the application of bayesian inference to optical tweezer experiments and advocate its use as a complement to standard non - bayesian methods .",
    "the langevin equation for a brownian particle confined in a potential @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a zero - mean gaussian white noise with variance @xmath16 as required by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "in the limit of vanishing inertia and a harmonic potential , @xmath17 , we obtain the overdamped langevin equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is now a zero - mean gaussian white noise with unit variance .",
    "this describes the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , whose sample paths obey the ito stochastic differential equation @xmath20 where @xmath9 is the mean - regression rate , @xmath10 is the volatility and @xmath21 is the wiener process @xcite .    for brownian motion , the mean regression rate @xmath22 is the ratio of the stiffness and the friction while the square of the volatility @xmath23 is twice the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "the latter follows by comparing the langevin and ito forms of the path equation and recalling the einstein relation @xmath7 between the diffusion and friction coefficients of a brownian particle . in problems involving brownian motion , it is convenient to work with the diffusion coefficient , rather than the volatility .",
    "the ratio of @xmath9 and @xmath6 provides the stiffness @xmath24 in units of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that , in general , there is no relation between the mean regression rate and volatility of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and the preceding identity is a consequence of additional @xmath25 constraints , namely the fluctuation - dissipation and einstein relations @xcite .    the transition probability density @xmath26@xmath27 ) , the probability of a displacement from @xmath28 at time @xmath29 to @xmath30 at time @xmath31 , obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath32 , where the fokker - planck operator is    @xmath33    the solution is a normal distribution ,    @xmath34\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the univariate normal distribution with mean @xmath4 and variance @xmath36 . this solution is exact and holds for arbitrary values of @xmath37 .",
    "the correlation function decays exponentially , @xmath38 a property guaranteed by doob s theorem for any gauss - markov processes @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the correlation function gives the power spectral density @xmath39 which is lorentzian in the angular frequency @xmath40 .",
    "the corner frequency @xmath41 is proportional to the mean regression rate .",
    "the stationary distribution @xmath42 obeys the steady state fokker - plank equation @xmath43 and the solution is , again , a normal distribution ,    @xmath44    comparing the forms of @xmath26 and @xmath45 it is clear that former tends to the latter for @xmath46 , as it should .",
    "the transition probability density yields the bayesian method for jointly estimating @xmath9 and @xmath6 ( and hence @xmath0 ) , while the stationary distribution yields the bayesian method for directly estimating @xmath0 alone .",
    "we now describe these two methods .",
    "consider , now , the time series @xmath47 consisting of observations of the sample path @xmath48 at the discrete times @xmath49 t with @xmath50 then , using the markov property of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , the probability of the sample path is given by @xcite @xmath51 the probability @xmath52 of the parameters , given the sample path , can now be computed using bayes theorem , as @xmath53 the denominator @xmath54 is an unimportant normalization , independent of the parameters , that we henceforth ignore . since both @xmath0 and @xmath1 must be positive , for stability and positivity of entropy production respectively , we use informative priors for @xmath9 and @xmath6 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this assigns zero probability weight for negative values of the parameters and equal probability weight for all positive values .",
    "the logarithm of the posterior probability , after using the explicit forms of @xmath26 and @xmath45 , is @xmath57 where we have defined the two quantities @xmath58    the maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimate @xmath59 solves the stationary conditions @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while the error bars of this estimate are obtained from the hessian matrix of second derivatives evaluated at the maximum @xcite . the analytical solution of the stationary conditions , derived in the appendix , yields the map estimate to be    [ eq : map - estimate ] @xmath62    where both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are now evaluated at @xmath65 and the sum runs from @xmath66 .",
    "these provide direct estimates of the parameters _ without _ the need for fitting , minimization , or monte carlo sampling .",
    "the error bars are obtained from a taylor expansion of the log posterior to quadratic order about the map value , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the matrix of second derivatives of the log posterior evaluated at the maximum .",
    "the elements @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 of the covariance matrix @xmath74 are the bayesian error bars ; they determine the size and shape of the bayesian credible region around the maximum @xcite .",
    "their unwieldy expressions are provided in the appendix and are made use of when computing credible regions around the map estimates .",
    "we refer to this bayesian estimation procedure as `` bayes i '' below .    a second bayesian procedure for directly estimating the trap stiffness results when",
    "@xmath75 is interpreted not as a time series but as an exchangeable sequence , or , in physical terms , as repeated independent observations of the stationary distribution @xmath42 @xcite . in that case , the posterior probability , assuming an informative prior that constrains @xmath0 to positive values , is @xmath76 the map estimate and its error bar follow straightforwardly from the posterior distribution as @xmath77 and , not unexpectedly , the standard error decreases as the number of observations increases .",
    "this procedure is independent of @xmath12 and is equivalent to the equipartition method when the heaviside prior is used for @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to this procedure as `` bayes ii '' below .",
    "the posterior probabilities in both methods can be written in terms of four functions of the data @xmath78 which , therefore , are the sufficient statistics of the problem .",
    "the _ entire _ information in the time series @xmath75 relevant to estimation is contained in these four statistics @xcite .",
    "their use reduces computational expense greatly , as only four numbers , rather than the entire time series , is needed for evaluating the posterior distributions .",
    "the posterior distributions obtained above are for flat priors .",
    "other choice of priors are possible .",
    "in particular , since both @xmath6 and @xmath0 are scale parameters a non - informative jeffreys prior is appropriate @xcite .",
    "jeffreys has observed , however , that `` an accurate statement of the prior probability is not necessary in a pure problem of estimation when the number of observations is large . ''",
    "the number of observations are in the tens of thousands in time series we study here and the posterior is dominated by the likelihoood rather than the prior . the prior",
    ", then , has an insignificant contribution to the posterior .",
    "we note that the error bars obtained in both bayes i and bayes ii refer to bayesian credible intervals , which are relevant to the uncertainty in the parameter estimates , given the data set @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , conventional error bars refer to frequentist confidence intervals , which are relevant to the outcomes of hypothetical repetitions of measurement . in general , bayesian credible intervals and frequentist confidence intervals",
    "are not identical and should @xmath79 be compared as they provide answers to separate questions @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the estimates for the trap stiffness obtained from these independent procedures provides a check on the validity of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process as a data model .",
    "any significant disagreement between the estimates from the two methods signals a breakdown of the applicability of the model and the assumptions implicit in it : overdamped dynamics , constant friction , harmonicity of the potential , and thermal equilibrium .",

    "we collect position fluctuation data of an optically trapped brownian particle using a standard optical tweezers setup that is described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief overview .",
    "the optical tweezers system is constructed around a zeiss inverted microscope ( _ axiovert.a1 _ ) with a @xmath81 @xmath82 numerical aperture ( na ) objective lens tightly focusing laser light at @xmath83 nm from a semiconductor laser ( _ lasever _ , maximum power @xmath84mw ) into the sample .",
    "the back aperture of the objective is slightly overfilled to maximize the trapping intensity .",
    "the sample consists of a dilute suspension ( volume fraction @xmath85 ) of polystyrene sphere of diameter @xmath86 m in 10% nacl - water solution , around @xmath87 of which is pipetted on a standard glass cover slip .",
    "the total power available at the trapping plane is around 15 mw .",
    "a single particle is trapped at an axial distance greater than several times its radius to avoid any wall - effects in the effective drag force due to the water , and it s motion is observed by back - focal plane interferometry using the back - scattered intensity of a detection laser at @xmath88 nm that co - propagates with the trapping laser .",
    "the detection laser power is maintained at much lower levels than that required to trap a particle .",
    "the back - scattered signal from the trapped particle is measured using a balanced detection scheme , schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : balanced - detection ] .",
    "the back - scattered light beam is incident on an edge mirror which divides it equally into two halves that are focused using two lenses of equal focal length on photodiodes pd1 and pd2 ( _ thorlabs _ pda100a - ec si - photodiodes of bandwidth 2.4 mhz ) . the voltage outputs @xmath89 and @xmath90 , of pd1 and pd2 respectively , are then combined as @xmath91 to give the normalized value of the @xmath28 coordinate of motion at any instant of time .",
    "the advantage of such balanced detection is that the intensity fluctuations of the laser are present in both beams simultaneously and are thus canceled out when the difference is taken .",
    "note that the direction of the edge mirror decides whether the @xmath28 or @xmath92 coordinate of motion is being measured .",
    "the mirror is rotated by @xmath93 degrees to select between the coordinates .",
    "the fast response of the photodiodes , with a rise time of 50ns at highest gain , ensures that spurious correlations are kept to a minimum and the data filtering necessary with slower commercial quadrant photodetectors is avoided entirely .",
    "the data from the photodiodes is logged into a computer using a national instruments daq system and labview at sampling rates between 2 - 5 khz . for calibrating the motion , _",
    "i.e. _ converting the voltage into physical distance which is necessary for measuring the diffusion constant , we employ an acousto - optic modulator that is placed in the back - focal plane of the microscope objective and scan the trapped bead by distances which are determined from the pixel calibration of images taken by the camera attached to the microscope @xcite .",

    "the bayesian modeling of the detection apparatus and the transformations it induces on the physical sample paths is not pursued here .",

    "the variance @xmath94 is used in the conventional `` equipartition '' method to estimate the spring constant @xmath0 , while the fitting of the autocorrelation to the exponential in eq.([eq : autocorr ] ) or of the spectral density to the lorentzian in eq .

    ", we employ the procedures suggested in @xcite , including `` blocking '' the data with a bin size of 100 points , and setting the frequency range for fitting in order to avoid systematic errors due to reliability issues at both low and high frequencies @xcite . however , there exist issues in estimating stiffness from both the equipartition method - where the presence of any additive noise leads to an increase in the variance that leads to over - estimation of the trap stiffness , and the psd - where the standard systematics related to fitting can be minimized at best but not removed .",
    "the results of bayesian inference are shown in figure .",

    "we show show filled contours of the posterior distribution in the @xmath95 plane , together with contours of equal probability , for the `` bayes i '' method .",
    "there is a single maximum at @xmath59 whose numerically computed value is in excellent agreement with the analytical map estimates of eq.([eq : map - estimate ] ) . in the bottom panel",
    "we show the bayesian posterior distribution for the stiffness for the `` bayes ii '' method .",
    "there is remarkably good agreement between the two bayesian estimates and the fit to the power spectral density as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : variation - of - trap ] ) and table .",
    "( [ tab : k - versus - power ] ) .",
    "this consistency between three conceptually and procedurally independent methods is evidence for the appropriateness of the data model .",
    "the agreement with the spectral density method , shown in the third column of the table , is within @xmath96 in all cases , other than the first case where the inherent low stiffness of the trap due to low trapping power led to larger systematics due to the increased influence of the ambient low frequency noise .",
    "the typical length of our time series is @xmath97 and this gives a bayesian error bar that is less than @xmath98% of the mean .",
    "these are well below the systematic errors and the approximately @xmath99 variability of the estimates obtained from the fitting procedure .",
    "the @xmath100 standard errors in the mean are indicated in parenthesis next to each @xmath0 value in table .",
    "( [ tab : k - versus - power ] ) .",
    "note that for inference of the absolute values of @xmath0 and @xmath101 , we have used a temperature of 300k which is the same as the lab environment temperature - this assumption being based on studies in literature @xcitewhere the effects of laser heating in water has shown to be well below 1k at the power levels we employ in the trap .",
    "however , the fact that the results from bayes i and bayes ii are extremely close to each other demonstrates that our estimate of temperature is trustworthy .    to compare the bayesian estimate for the diffusion coefficient we repeat the experiment for different solvent viscosities keeping both the laser power ( corresponding to @xmath102 6 @xmath103 ) and the particle radius ( @xmath104 ) fixed .",
    "the stokes - einstein relation then provides an estimate of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we compare this estimate with the map estimate @xmath101 in table .",
    "( [ tab : viscometry ] ) to find agreement to within @xmath105 in all cases .",
    "the stokes - einstein relation can be used `` in reverse '' to obtain a map estimate of the viscosity , @xmath106 , which agrees very well with the known viscosity of the mixture .",
    "the experiments were performed for five sets of data for each viscosity sample and the mean value of @xmath101 has been reported with the corresponding 1@xmath10 error in parenthesis . the error bars , which are higher than that for the @xmath0 measurement , chiefly reflect the systematic errors in our experimental apparatus that may arise due to slow drifts of the laser power , beam pointing of the laser , drifts in ambient temperature and possibly other unidentified reasons .",
    "such systematic effects occur at time scales longer than @xmath107 , which is the duration over which a single data set is collected .",
    "we have checked that the estimates of @xmath101over different non - overlapping segments of a _ single _ data set are within the bayesian error bars , which confirms that the errors we observe are due to systematic shifts in the operating conditions of the experiment . the agreement in the viscosity values for that measured in the rheometer and by the bayesian estimate of @xmath101is within 5% for all cases with the exception of the last , where the enhanced friction caused a shift in @xmath9 towards lower values , once again increasing the effects of systematics due to ambient low frequency noise sources . also , since this value corresponded to the highest concentration of glycerol in the water + glycerol mixture , the effects of laser heating could have been more significant @xcite , leading to a slight increase of temperature at the trap focal volume which we have not considered in the bayesian estimate .",
    "thus , we conclude that the bayesian method can be used for accurate viscometry using only the discretely observed sample paths of a trapped brownian particle .",

    "<S> bayesian inference provides a principled way of estimating the parameters of a stochastic process that is observed discretely in time . </S>",
    "<S> the overdamped brownian motion of a particle confined in an optical trap is generally modelled by the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and can be observed directly in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> here we present bayesian methods for inferring the parameters of this process , the trap stiffness and the particle diffusion coefficient , that use exact likelihoods and sufficient statistics to arrive at simple expressions for the maximum a posteriori estimates . </S>",
    "<S> this obviates the need for monte carlo sampling and yields methods that are both fast and accurate . </S>",
    "<S> we apply these to experimental data and demonstrate their advantage over commonly used non - bayesian fitting methods . </S>"
