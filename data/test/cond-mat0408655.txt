    "the interior of cells is both highly structured and dynamical .",
    "active transport therefore plays a crucial role to target molecules to the various compartments of the cell as well as to maintain and reorganize the cell s structure .",
    "these tasks are accomplished by the cytoskeleton , a network of protein fibers , and the cytoskeletal motors , proteins which use the filaments of the cytoskeleton as highways or rails for directed transport .",
    "cytoskeletal motors are enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of adenosinetriphosphate ( atp ) and , at the same time , use the free energy released from this reaction to perform mechanical work and convert it into directed movements .",
    "these motor molecules have been studied extensively during the last decade , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the main emphasis has been on the properties of single motor molecules , their motor mechanisms , and their directed walks along filaments @xcite .    the nanometer size and piconewton forces of the molecular motors",
    "imply that the typical binding energies are of the order of the thermal energy @xmath0 and that the motor  filament binding can be overcome by thermal fluctuations . on large time and",
    "length scales ( @xmath1s and @xmath2 m ) , motors perform peculiar random walks , where periods of directed active movements along filaments alternate with periods of non - directed brownian motion in the surrounding fluid after unbinding from a filament @xcite .",
    "( a related problem is the effective diffusion of an adsorbed particle along a surface via bulk excursions @xcite . )",
    "in order to study these random walks , we have recently introduced a class of lattice models , which are , on the one hand generic in the sense that they are independent of the specific motor mechanisms , but which we can , on the other hand , also apply to describe specific motor molecules by adapting the model parameters to the observed transport properties @xcite . in addition , we can easily incorporate motor  motor interactions such as the mutual exclusion from binding sites of the filaments , which leads to traffic jam-like density pattern and various kinds of phase transitions @xcite    in the following , we will review our results for the motor s random walks obtained from these lattice models and present some new results from the corresponding continuum equations .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we introduce the lattice models in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec:2d3d ] ,",
    "we summarize our analytical results for the random walks on a lattice without confining walls . compartments with confining walls which are experimentally accessible are studied in section [ sec : finitegeoms ] , where we summarize our numerical results and present new analytical results from a continuum description of the random walks .",
    "we have studied the random walks arising from many encounters with filaments by mapping them to random walks on a lattice @xcite .",
    "a line of lattice sites represents a filament .",
    "motors at these sites perform a biased random walk and move predominantly in one direction . per unit time , they make a forward step , a backward step and no step with probability @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively , where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension . with a small probability @xmath7",
    ", they move to each of the adjacent non - filament sites and thus unbind from the filament . at the non - filament sites the motors perform simple symmetric random walks and",
    "move to each neighbor site with probability @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes the spatial dimension ) and rebind to the filament with probability @xmath10 when they reach again a filament site .",
    "confining walls are implemented as repulsive boundaries , at which all movements into the walls are rejected .",
    "consider a discrete time random walk on a two dimensional square lattice with lattice sites labeled by integer coordinates @xmath11 with the above transition probabilities .",
    "the master equation for this dynamics reads  @xcite @xmath12 as initial condition we take an ensemble of particles at @xmath13 .",

    "the average position of the motors bound to the filament is given by @xmath39 and their average speed is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the average speed if the particles did not leave the line . for large times",

    "the effective motor velocity is reduced by a factor @xmath45 , i.e. , by the probability that a motor is in the bound state .",
    "the relation @xmath46 also applies to a simple two - state random walk , where motion is directed in one of the states only .",
    "in contrast to the simple two - state random walk , however , the probability @xmath47 is time - dependent .",

    "the results for the latter read at short @xmath32 @xmath52 and for large @xmath32 @xmath53 the limiting value of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath54 is large compared to the diffusion coefficient of the one - dimensional random walk along the filament , @xmath55 .",
    "this broadening of the distribution occurs since the unbound motors lag behind the bound ones , which implies that also the rebinding motors lag behind those that have been bound for some time .    _",
    "the density profile on the filament _ can be evaluated analytically for large @xmath56 and @xmath32 , @xmath57 the exponential decay for @xmath58 expresses the large probability of unbinding for @xmath59 .",
    "comparison with the results of monte carlo simulations shows very good agreement for times larger than about 8000 time steps @xcite .      eventually every motor will unbind and diffuse in the surrounding fluid",

    "whereas each individual motor has zero average velocity in the fluid , the statistical velocity @xmath62 is non - zero , since it is driven by unbinding from the cloud of motors moving on the filament .",
    "the longitudinal diffusion coefficient behaves at large times as @xmath63+{1}/{4}$ ] .",
    "the order of magnitude @xmath64 tells us that , like on the line , longitudinal diffusion is strongly enhanced by the unbinding from and binding back to the line .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is modified much less , @xmath65 at short times , while at large times @xmath66 .",
    "so the transverse diffusion starts out very small , and finally reaches its free space value .    _",
    "the spatio - temporal density profile of the unbound motors _ can also be derived , @xmath67    the presence of multiple tracks on microtubules can be modeled by internal states , which keeps the problem solvable  @xcite .",

    "the main difference is now that the density of motors on the filament decays faster , as @xmath73 , because of a reduced return probability .",
    "lack of space prevents us to discuss this any further , but we will present some results from continuum equations for the three - dimensional case below .",
    "we have also studied these random walks in compartments with simple geometries which are accessible to _ in vitro _",
    "experiments @xcite . in these geometries ,",
    "a filament is immobilized to a surface , and the diffusion of unbound motors is restricted by confining walls . in the simplest case , the unbound motors can diffuse freely in the half space above the surface to which the filament is immobilized . by placing the filament in a quasi two - dimensional slab or in a rectangular or cylindrical tube",
    ", diffusion can be restricted along one or two dimensions perpendicular to the filament .",
    "we denote the linear extensions of the compartments by @xmath74 . scaling arguments and simulations",
    "show that , at large times with @xmath75 , when the motors experience the presence of the confining walls , these systems exhibit the same scaling behavior as systems with the same dimensionality , but without confining walls . for compartments with unconfined diffusion in @xmath76 dimensions perpendicular to the filament ,",
    "the effective velocity is given by @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the continuum equations for the random walks of the motors can be solved in a similar way to the master equations of the lattice models . since",
    "boundary conditions are easily implemented in the continuum model , we use them to derive analytical solutions for the half space , slab and tube geometry , see also ref .",

    "_ full three - dimensional space .",
    "_ let us start with the full three - dimensional space .",
    "we use the fourier  laplace transformed form of eqs .",
    "( [ diff_gl1_3d ] ) and ( [ diff_gl2_3d ] ) , @xmath88 with the momentum @xmath89 and with the same initial conditions as before .",
    "this leads to @xmath90 to obtain a convergent integral , we introduce a cutoff @xmath91 as the upper integration limit .",
    "this cutoff corresponds to a certain range of attraction or thickness of the filament or a size of the motor and assures that the motor indeed returns to the filament .",
    "defining @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 where the second expression is valid for small @xmath95 and @xmath36 .",
    "as before , the binding probability is obtained for @xmath24 . for sufficiently small @xmath95 ,",
    "the cutoff term can be neglected , and inverting the laplace transform leads to @xmath96 in agreement with the result from the lattice model .    _ half space . _",
    "the case of the half space can be treated by the method of reflection and superposition , see e.g.  ref .",
    "the part of the three - dimensional solution for @xmath97 can be reflected at the surface , so that the superposition @xmath98 is obtained , which fulfills the boundary condition @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "the density profile is symmetric under reflection at the plane @xmath100 , so we obtain just twice the solution for the full three - dimensional space and thus , also the double for the velocity and the displacement .    _ slab .",
    "_ let us now consider a slab of height @xmath101 , where the filament is located at @xmath102 in the middle of the slab .",
    "the case where the filament is immobilized at the lower surface of the slab follows then by reflection and superposition .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath103 at @xmath104 or , equivalently , periodic boundary conditions at @xmath104 .",
    "we can therefore expand the unbound density into a fourier series , @xmath105 with @xmath106 . here and in the following we use the symbol @xmath107 for discrete and @xmath20 for continuous momentum variables .",
    "for the other variables , we take the fourier and laplace transforms in the same way as above .",
    "( [ p0_as_integral_d=3 ] ) becomes now @xmath108 we integrate out @xmath109 as before .",
    "in addition , we approximate the summation over @xmath110 by the term for @xmath111 and twice the integral @xmath112 where we introduced again a cutoff @xmath113 . we obtain @xmath114^{-1}\\ ] ] for small @xmath36 . for motors which have not yet reached the boundaries of the slab , i.e.  for @xmath115",

    "the square root term is dominating in eq .",
    "( [ slab_lsg ] ) and we obtain the two - dimensional result @xcite with an effective reattachment rate @xmath117 . in summary , at large times the probability to be bound to the filament and , thus , the effective velocity @xmath77 behave as @xmath118 with the crossover time @xmath119 .    _",
    "_ finally , a tube with quadratic cross - section can be studied in the same way . in this case",
    "we have two discrete momenta @xmath120 and @xmath121 corresponding to the transverse coordinates @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and eq .

    "the crossover to the long - time regime is governed by the crossover time @xmath131 where the last expression holds for large @xmath74 and agrees with the crossover time obtained for the slab .",
    "molecular motors exhibit peculiar random walks which arise from the repeated binding to and unbinding from filaments . we have obtained analytical results for these random walks in systems without and with confining walls by solving the master equations of lattice models and the corresponding continuum equations .",
