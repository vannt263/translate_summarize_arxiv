    "the discovery of hawking radiation and the black - hole ( bh ) evaporation phenomenon @xcite raised several outstanding open questions and intriguing puzzles .",
    "one such problem which attracted a lot of attention is the _ information puzzle _ : simple thought experiments suggest that in the process of black - hole formation and evaporation , a pure initial quantum state will evolve into a mixed state , and consequently part of the information encoded in the initial state will get lost .",
    "apparently this problem of information loss is intimately related to another conceptual problem in black - hole physics : the formation of a spacetime singularity inside the bh .",
    "pictorially speaking , a portion of the initial information propagates to the singularity and disappears there .",
    "it is widely anticipated , however , that the formation of spacetime singularities is a mere artifact of the classical ( and semiclassical ) theory , but quantum gravity will eventually resolve the black - hole singularities , and presumably solve the information puzzle as well .    in 1992 , callan , giddings , harvey , and strominger ( cghs ) @xcite proposed a simplified framework for investigating black - hole formation and evaporation .",
    "they introduced a two - dimensional toy - model with gravity and matter fields coupled to a dilaton scalar field . at the classical level",
    "this model admits a one - parameter family of static black - hole solutions ( parameterized by their mass ) .",
    "when semiclassical corrections are added , the two - dimensional black hole emits thermal radiation and consequently evaporates .",
    "based on the trace anomaly , cghs provided simple explicit expressions for the semiclassical contribution to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "consequence the semiclassical dynamics may be formulated as a closed ( constrained ) system of second - order partial differential equations .",
    "it thus provides a simple framework for exploring various aspects of black - hole evaporation , and particularly the information puzzle @xcite .",
    "originally it was hoped @xcite that the cghs evaporating bh will be free of any singularities .",
    "however , russo , susskind and thorlacius @xcite soon found that a singularity inevitably develops inside the cghs bh , at a certain value of the dilaton filed .",
    "thus , the cghs formalism does not resolve the information puzzle at the semiclassical level .",
    "one may still hope , however , that when the model is fully quantized the singularity ( and the information puzzle ) will be resolved .",
    "this approach was pursued by ashtekar , taveras , and varadarajan @xcite , who formulated the quantum - field analog of the two - dimensional cghs model . in this",
    "set - up , the original cghs variables are replaced by quantum operators .",
    "spacetime evolution is then described by a system of operator partial differential equations .",
    "the exact solution to these operator equations is not known .",
    "nevertheless , some approximate solutions were constructed @xcite , illuminating certain aspects of the problem of black - hole evaporation , and suggesting that the singularity will indeed be resolved in the quantized theory .",
    "the above discussion signifies the inevitable spacetime singularity as a key feature of the cghs semiclassical bh spacetime .",
    "however , the detailed structure and properties of this singularity have not been investigated so far to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the main purpose of this manuscript is to present such a detailed analysis of the structure of that singularity .",
    "the motivation for this investigation is obvious from the discussion above : first , since this singularity plays such a crucial role in the information - loss puzzle , it will be useful to better understand its properties .",
    "for example , one would like to know how strong this singularity is , and what are the prospects for extending semiclassical spacetime beyond it .",
    "second , understanding the asymptotic behavior of the various fields at the singularity may provide a useful starting point for exploring how quantum treatments ( like that of ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) may resolve the singularity .    although the main objective of this paper is the asymptotic behavior near the singularity , we also analyze here the internal structure of the evaporating semiclassical bh in the entire range from the horizon to the singularity .",
    "we do this by constructing approximate solutions in various domains of the bh interior , and then matching these solutions at their respective overlap regions .",
    "understanding the entire bh internal structure is interesting on its own right , but is also important for full determination of the singularity structure : when the latter is derived by a purely local analysis , one obtains a family of local asymptotic solutions which depend on certain free parameters ( or free functions , depending on the context ) .",
    "the value of these parameters in an actual bh solution needs to be determined by matching to initial conditions ( e.g. at the horizon ) .",
    "the full internal solution , from the horizon to the singularity , is required for obtaining the right values of these parameters .",
    "as long as the evaporating black hole is macroscopic , the semiclassical effects are very weak in a local dynamical sense .",
    "this allows one to employ the _",
    "adiabatic approximation_. namely , any local region of spacetime may be well approximated by a certain classical cghs bh solution ( with a certain mass parameter ) .",
    "the classical bh solutions are static outside the horizon but homogeneous inside it , implying that the interior of a macroscopic evaporating bh is ( locally ) approximately homogeneous .",
    "this _ homogeneous approximation _ is a key element in our investigation .",
    "it greatly simplifies the analysis , as the field equations now reduce to ordinary differential equations .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the cghs action and field equations , and re - formulate them in new variables . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the homogenous approximation .",
    "we explore its main properties and its domain of validity . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the singularities of the homogenous field equations , and obtain the local asymptotic behavior of the solution near these singularities . in sec .",
    "v we construct an approximate solution for the fields inside the evaporating bh , in the entire range from the horizon to the spacelike singularity .    in sec .",
    "vi we present simple effective lagrangian and hamiltonian which yields the local asymptotic dynamics near the spacelike singularity .",
    "the construction of such effective lagrangian and hamiltonian is motivated by the idea , that perhaps it will be possible to employ simple quantum - mechanical considerations to resolve the singularity ( and thereby to explore the possible extension of spacetime beyond it ) .",
    "although such a quantum - mechanical treatment is beyond the scope of the present paper , we nevertheless take here the preparatory step ( carried out entirely within the semiclassical framework ) of constructing the effective near - singularity lagrangian and hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarize our main results and discuss their significance .",
    "we begin by presenting the two - dimensional semiclassical cghs model @xcite . beside the dilaton @xmath0 , this model contains a large number @xmath1 of identical scalar matter fields @xmath2 , and a cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "we express the metric in double - null coordinates @xmath4 ( the `` conformal gauge '' ) , namely @xmath5 .",
    "the action then reads    l d^2 [ e^ - 2 ( - 2,_uv + 4  , _ u , _ v - ^2 e^2 ) + -_i = 1^n f_i,_u f_i,_v + , _ u , _",
    "v ] +    .[action ] the last term in the action expresses the semiclassical effects .",
    "the einstein equations take the form : t _ uv & = e^ - 2 ( 2,_uv- 4 , _ u , _ v - ^2 e^2 ) -,_uv = 0 [ t_uv ] and t _ uu = e^-2 ( 4,_u , _ u - 2,_uu ) + _ i = 1^n f_i,_u f_i,_u   + - [ , _ u , _",

    "v-,_vv-_v(v)]= 0 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 encode the information about the initial quantum state , which in turn determines the semiclassical fluxes .",
    "the dilaton and matter equations are : -4,_uv + 4,_u,_v + 2,_uv & + ^2 e^2 = 0 , [ cghs_dilaton_matter_eq ] + _",
    "u_v f_i = 0 .    throughout this paper",
    "we set @xmath8 .",
    "this choice is equivalent to the change of variable @xmath9 , which does not affect the field equations otherwise .",
    "we also set @xmath10 , as we are dealing here with the evaporation rather than formation of the bh .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define new variables : @xmath11 , @xmath12 . a straightforward substitution of the new variables in eqs .",
    "( [ t_uv],[cghs_dilaton_matter_eq ] ) yields : & r,_uv = - e^s - k,_uv , [ evolution_eq_mixed ] + & s,_uv = k,_uv /r , where @xmath13 is to be substituted , and @xmath14 expresses the magnitude of the quantum effects .",
    "the constraint equations become : r,_ww - r,_w s,_w + t_ww = 0,[constraint_evolution_mixed]where hereafter @xmath15 stands for either @xmath16 or @xmath17 . the semiclassical energy fluxes @xmath18 along both null directions",
    "are given by : t_ww = k.    it is useful to re - express the system of evolution equations ( [ evolution_eq_mixed ] ) in its standard form , in which @xmath19 and @xmath20 are explicitly given in terms of lower - order derivatives : & r,_uv = - e^s - r,_u r,_v , [ final_eq_simplified ] + & s,_uv = e^s + r,_u r,_v .this form makes it obvious that the evolution equations become singular when @xmath21 .",
    "this singularity , which in the original variables takes place at @xmath22 , was already noticed preivously @xcite .",
    "below we shall explore in some detail the homogeneous variant of this singularity .",
    "the semi - classical equations reduce to the classical ones by setting @xmath23 : & r,_uv = - e^s , [ schwarzschild equations ] + & s,_uv = 0 , and the constraint equations : @xmath24 this set of equations admits a one - parameter family of solutions ( up to gauge transformations ) , which is the dilatonic two - dimensional analog of the standard schwarzschild solution .",
    "each member of this family describes a black - hole space - time , which ( like its standard four - dimensional counterpart ) is static outside the bh and homogeneous inside it . throughout this paper",
    "we shall simply refer to this class of solutions as the `` schwarzschild solution '' ( despite a slight abuse of standard terminology ) .",
    "we shall focus on the internal part of the bh . in eddington - like double - null",
    "coordinates the internal solution takes the form & r = - e^v+u + m , [ schwartz_sol_eddington ] + & s = v+u , where @xmath25 is the ( dilatonic , 2-dimensional ) schwarzschild mass parameter .",
    "we shall now restrict our attention to the homogeneous solutions of the semiclassical field equations inside the evaporating bh , namely , solutions which only depend on @xmath26 , where we define t v+u , x v - u .",
    "we first need to discuss the justification for this homogeneous approximation and its domain of validity .",
    "the classical interior solution ( [ schwartz_sol_eddington ] ) is obviously homogeneous as it depends on @xmath27 solely . in an evaporating bh",
    ", however , the semiclassical effects spoil the exact homogeneity , as manifested by the drift in the bh mass . yet , as long as the bh is macroscopic ( @xmath28 ) , this drift is very slow .",
    "indeed it undoubtedly has a dramatic effect over the long evaporation time - scale  the bh eventually disappears ( or at least becomes microscopic ) after all . yet , from a local point of view this drift is of negligibly small rate .",
    "thus , over a typical dynamical time / length scale ( say , @xmath29 of order @xmath30 ) , the change in @xmath25 is @xmath31 and may be neglected , which naturally leads to the homogeneous approximation .",
    "the local , relative magnitude of the semiclassical terms is of order @xmath32 , as can be seen in the evolution equations ( [ final_eq_simplified ] ) .",
    "as long as the bh is macroscopic ( @xmath28 ) , and as long as we are dealing with the portion @xmath33 of the bh space - time , we may apply the adiabatic point of view to the evaporation process : namely , in each region of space - time the solution is approximately schwarzschild , with a local effective mass parameter @xmath25 which slowly drifts in @xmath17 and/or @xmath16",
    ". we shall refer to this slowly varying function @xmath34 as the _ effective mass _ of the evaporating bh .",

    "there are strong local semiclassical effects , and the local solution is very different from schwarzschild ( as demonstrated in the next section ) .",
    "we argue , however , that the homogeneous approximation is still valid in this small-@xmath38 domain .",
    "generally speaking , this follows from causality : since the small-@xmath38 region is located at the causal future of the moderate-@xmath38 interior region , it simply inherits the approximate homogeneity of the latter .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us pick a point inside the evaporating bh , in a region where the effective mass is still macroscopic , @xmath40 .",
    "this point is picked at a certain @xmath38 value , @xmath41 , which is @xmath42  say @xmath43 ( recall that the horizon is located at @xmath44 ) .",

    "this construction is illustrated in fig.[fig_space_time ] .",
    "we shall now consider two cases , namely two slightly different solutions : in case ( i ) , we specify on @xmath47 initial data which exactly correspond to the classical schwarzschild solution with mass @xmath51 . since these data are independent of @xmath52 by construction , the evolving solution will be precisely homogeneous , throughout the domain of dependence @xmath53 .",
    "provided that @xmath50 is taken to be large enough , @xmath53 will reach the small-@xmath38 space - like singularity ( more precisely , the @xmath21 singularity which we explore in the next section ) . to this end",

    "this span is of order @xmath55 ( for instance , for @xmath56 this @xmath26-span is @xmath57 in the classical solution , and approximately the same number in the semiclassical solution ) . hence taking @xmath58 ( say ) guaranties that @xmath53 will include a portion of the small-@xmath38 singularity ( as illustrated in fig.[fig_space_time ] ) .",

    "therefore , we may regard the actual initial data ( ii ) as the homogeneous , schwarzschild data of case ( i ) plus a small perturbation .",
    "this initial perturbation will evolve into a small perturbation throughout the interior of @xmath53 .",
    "the relative magnitude of this perturbation will be controlled by the small parameter @xmath65 , and for sufficiently small value of this parameter we may neglect the perturbation at the leading order .    the smallness of the perturbations in the interior of @xmath53 is then guaranteed by standard stability theorems for nonlinear hyperbolic systems .",
    "one may be concerned , however , about the effect of the perturbation in the immediate neighborhood of the small-@xmath38 singularity , and in particular on the very structure of the latter .",
    "a close examination , which is beyond the scope of the present paper , reveals that this singularity is locally stable to inhomogeneities .",
    "( that is , an inhomogeneous variant of the @xmath21 singularity exists @xcite , and this inhomogeneous singularity is generic , in the sense that it depends on four arbitrary functions of @xmath52 . and @xmath54 in eq .",

    "this approximation is valid as long as the bh mass is macroscopic .",

    "thus , the metric tensor is continuous and non - singular , but its derivative diverges .",
    "the @xmath21 singularity may be classified as _ deformationally - weak _ @xcite,@xcite : an extended body will only experience a finite tidal deformation as it approaches the singularity .",
    "we briefly discuss here the possibility of extending semiclassical spacetime beyond the @xmath21 singularity . from the discussion above it",

    ", continuous extensions do exist .",
    "in fact , there is a two - parameter family of such continuous extensions ( characterized by the values of b and @xmath186 beyond @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , in our view , the problem of extending the semiclassical solution beyond the singularity is primarily a problem of _ ambiguity _ : a priori it is not clear which of the infinite possible extensions will be chosen by nature ( if any ) .",
    "we expect that a fully - quantized treatment ( like @xcite for example ) should provide the answer to the extension problem : first , it should tell us if a semiclassical phase at all develops beyond the @xmath21 singularity , and second , if such a semiclassical extension indeed develops , it should determine which semiclassical branch is selected .",
