    "( we refer to such a player as a copy player . )",
    "we found interesting spatial patterns , such as vortices and sinks , appearing particularly on the triangular lattice .",
    "the spatial pattern with vortices and sinks appears as a coexisting steady state on the triangular lattice .",
    "as far as we know , the previous studies considered the rsp game either on the square lattice  @xcite or on various networks  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , easy to imagine that triangles appear in the population dynamics in reality , _ e.g. _  clusters in complex networks .",
    "it is also known that elementary properties can be very different in many - body systems on non - bipartite lattices and on bipartite lattices .",
    "the vortex pattern that we observe in the present study is , in fact , due to the frustration of the triangular lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , a three - sided situation where each of the three players around a triangle chooses the rock , the scissors and the paper , respectively .",
    "( hereafter , we refer to the three hands simply as the hands  2 , 1 and  0 , respectively . )",
    "the existence of vortices was pointed out by some studies in the past  @xcite .",
    "we here stress the importance of the frustration as the cause of the stationary vortex pattern .",
    "we show that the stationary vortex pattern does not appear on the square lattice nor on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the new model and discuss its elementary properties . we show that pairs of vortices and sinks can appear as spatial patterns .",
    "we also argue that players close a vortex core scores a high point while players close to a sink scores a low point .",
    "we report the results of our simulation on the triangular lattice in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and on the square and honeycomb lattices in sec .",
    "we confirm that the spatial pattern with vortices and sinks is stationary on the triangular lattice , while it is not on the square nor honeycomb lattices . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we introduce a random player , who chooses its hand randomly .",
    "we show that a random player can be a source in the spatial pattern .",
    "we propose a model where players residing on lattice points repeatedly play the rsp game with the nearest neighbors .",
    "we hereafter consider the triangular lattice , the square lattice and the honeycomb lattice , with an emphasis on the triangular lattice , whose frustration generates stationary vortices in the course of the rsp game .",
    "all players on the lattice points make their moves all at once , which constitutes one time step .",
    "a move is either 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "the hand  1 wins over the hand  0 , the hand  2 wins over the hand  1 , and the hand  0 wins over the hand  2 .",
    "a win , a draw or a loss are determined between each pair of the nearest neighbors of the lattice .",
    "each player scores one point for a win , zero point for a draw and minus one point for a loss .",
    "hence , a player can score @xmath0 points at most and minus @xmath0 points at least in each time step , where @xmath0 is the number of the nearest neighbors on the lattice ( @xmath1 for the triangular lattice , @xmath2 for the square lattice and @xmath3 for the honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "this is a zero - sum game ; that is , the sum of the scores of all the players is always zero .    particularly on the triangular lattice , we define the frustration and its sign ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we refer as a positive frustration to the situation where the hands  2 , 1 , and  0 appear in this order when we circle around a triangle counterclockwise . on the other hand ,",
    "a negative frustration is the situation where the hands  0 , 1 , and  2 appear in this order when we circle around a triangle counterclockwise .",
    "we will argue in the next subsection that a positive frustration generates a counterclockwise vortex , whereas a negative frustration generates a clockwise vortex .",
    "all the players choose their hands at random in the initial time step with an equal probability .",
    "each player adopts the copy strategy or the random strategy afterwards .",
    "the copy strategy is to choose a hand of the player who , of all the nearest neighbors and the player itself , marked the highest score in the last time step .",
    "we refer to a player adopting the copy strategy as a copy player hereafter .",
    "if there are more than a player of the highest score with different hands , a copy player chooses a hand from their hands randomly .",
    "the random strategy is to choose a hand at random .",
    "we refer to a player adopting the random strategy as a random player . in the present study",
    ", we consider only the case where each player is either a copy player or a random player all through the game .",
    "we mostly consider copy players hereafter . we show that copy players on the triangular lattice exhibit vortex structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we discuss an impact of random players on the structure as impurities .      before showing the simulation results , let us argue that two spatial patterns typically appear .",
    "one is a vortex and the other is a sink .",
    "they are logical consequences of the combination of the rsp game and the copy strategy .",
    "note first that copy players tend to form domains of the same hands . a copy player well inside a domain of , say",
    ", the hand  0 , will keep the hand  0 in the next time step because all its neighbors are of the hand  0 and their scores are all zero ; hence the bulk of the domain is stable .",
    "copy players on the boundary of a domain , on the other hand , may change their hands in the next time step , and hence the boundary moves .",
    "let us argue how the boundary moves in the following two cases .",
    "the three domains of the hands 0 , 1 and 2 can have either the topology of fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) or  ( b ) .",
    "( a )     ( b )     +        ( c )    in the topology of fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( a )",
    ", there is a negative frustration around the point a and a positive frustration around the point b. a copy player of , say , the hand  0 , located just outside the domain of the hand  1 , tends to choose the hand  1 in the next time step because the neighbors with the hand  1 get high scores .",
    "thus the boundary between the domains of the hand  0 and the hand  1 moves onto the the domain of the hand  0 , so that the domain of the hand  1 expands .",
    "likewise , the boundary between the domains of the hand  1 and the hand  2 moves onto the domain of the hand  1 and the boundary between the domains of the hand  2 and the hand  0 moves on to the domain of the hand  2 .",
    "hence the boundaries rotate clockwise around the negative frustration at the point a and counterclockwise around the positive frustration at the point b. we will indeed show below in section  [ sec3 - 2 ] that the boundaries take a configuration schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( c ) .",
    "that is , the topology of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( a ) generates a pair of vortices of moving boundaries .",
    "( a similar argument for a different model can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "we refer to the counterclockwise vortex as a positive vortex and the clockwise vortex as a negative vortex . in short ,",
    "a positive frustration of a configuration generates a positive vortex of moving boundaries and a negative frustration generates a negative vortex .    in the topology of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) , on the other hand , the circular boundaries shrink toward the center ; the players with the hand  0 just inside the boundary mimic the players with the hand  1 just outside the boundary .",
    "the central domain of the hand  0 collapses eventually .",
    "then the domain of the hand  1 becomes the central domain and will collapse after a while .",
    "thus the topology of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) generates a sink .",
    "finally , a source does not appear when there are only copy players , because a new domain is never generated inside a domain .",
    "it is spontaneously generated only when some players adopt strategies other than the copy strategy .",
    "specifically , a random player can be a source as is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] .",
    "we here argue that the scores of the players near a vortex core are high , while those near a sink are low . both in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) and  ( c ) , the boundaries are not straight .",
    "near the vortex cores in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) , the number of the winners ( the hand  2 ) is one less than the number of the losers ( the hand  1 ) .",
    "since this is a zero - sum game even locally , the total of the positive scores of the winners is equal to the total of the negative scores of the losers . therefore , the time - averaged positive score of a winner is greater than the time - averaged negative score of a loser .",
    "for example , the player with the hand  2 at the corner of the boundary scores @xmath4 , whereas the player with the hand  1 at the corner of the boundary scores @xmath5 . in other words , each player wins a high score when it is a winner and loses a low score when it is a loser .",
    "since each player spends about equal time as a winner and as a loser over a long time , the time - averaged score is positive . in short , the time - averaged score of a player around a vortex",
    "is positive .",
    "the closer a player is to the vortex core , the more often the bend appears in the boundary , and the higher the time - averaged score of the player is .",
    "the situation is the opposite near a sink .",
    "around the bend of the boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( b ) , the number of the winners ( the hand  2 ) is one greater than the number of the losers ( the hand  1 ) . each player , as a winner , share the total positive score with more players and , as a loser , share the total negative score with less players .",
    "hence the time - averaged score of a player around a sink is negative .",
    "the closer a player is to the center of the sink , the lower the time - averaged score of the player is .    for example ,",
    "let us calculate the time - averaged score over the two steps of fig .",
