    ", there has been increased interest in optomechanical and electromechanical systems@xcite , which parametrically couple a driven electromagnetic mode to a high - q , low frequency mechanical mode .",
    "such devices are capable of being used for displacement measurements , sideband cooling , amplification of mechanical motion , and for investigating quantum behavior of macroscopic mechanical resonators@xcite .",
    "a microwave reentrant cavity transducer is such a device , which can provide a very sensitve high - q microwave mode .",
    "the reentrant cavity has been developed in the past for high precision transductance of gravitational wave detectors ( highly sensitive and highly massive optomechanical systems)@xcite , attempting to measure the standard quantum limit ( sql)@xcite and investigating the dynamic casimir effect@xcite .",
    "the key component of the reentrant transducer is a narrow - gap superconducting reentrant cavity , which could achieve high displacement sensitivity of about few hundreds mhz/@xmath1m@xcite , and high electrical q - factor of up to @xmath2 at 1.5 k@xcite .",
    "all the previous work on reentrant cavity resonators discuss single mode devices , in this work we show for the first time that higher order modes exist , which is of general interest as many of these applications would benefit directly by having more than one highly sensitive transducer mode in the cavity .",
    "reentrant cylindrical cavities have been studied for more than 50 years@xcite and have been implemented in multiple ways@xcite .",
    "previously , we constructed a tunable reentrant cavity , which consists of an empty cylindrical cavity and a cylindrical post in the centre of the cavity@xcite .",
    "the position of the cylindrical post was adjustable along the cylindrical axis of the resonator by a fine screw mechanism , which offers a rotation - free translation of the post . by gradually screwing the post into the cavity the resonant mode",
    "was transformed from the standard @xmath3 mode in an empty cylinder , to the fundamental tm mode of reentrant cavity .",
    "since the field structure of the mode was dramatically transformed , a very large tuning range was achieved from 22 ghz down to about 2 ghz . also ,",
    "as the post was inserted and became close to the adjacent cavity wall , the electric field was confined within the capacitive gap region formed by the post and the wall leading to a very high displacement sensitivity of around @xmath4350 mhz/@xmath1 m at 10 @xmath1 m gap size .",

    "below : the cylindrical post and an additional ring of the reentrant - ring cavity is positioned at the two anti - nodes of @xmath5 field as shown to create the reentrant cavity mode . in this work",
    "the height of the ring is kept same as the central post.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in a similar way it should be possible to create higher order reentrant cavity modes based on the @xmath6 mode of a cylindrical cavity ( @xmath7 ) . in this paper",
    "we show the existence of the next order mode with @xmath8 .",
    "the azimuthal magnetic field , @xmath9 , of @xmath10 mode includes two nodes along the radial axis of the cavity , while the @xmath5 field has two anti - nodes ( see the top curve of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) . to create the higher order mode we conceive the concept of the reentrant - ring ( rr ) cavity , while the common reentrant cylindrical cavity we refer to as a single - post ( sp ) cavity .",
    "the geometry of the rr cavity is shown schematically in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , which consists of a central post and an additional ring positioned at the two anti - nodes of @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . in this work",
    "the heights of the central post and the ring are kept the same for simplicity .",
    "the cavity was simulated using the finite - element method ( fem ) and in comparison with the sp reentrant cavity ( of the same size ) the rr cavity is shown to have a higher displacement sensitivity .",
    "several cavity configurations were examined experimentally , with consistent results verified from the finite - element simulations .",
    "since the rr cavity is an axisymmetric structure it was analyzed using a 2d finite element model .",
    "poisson superfish software  @xcite was used for the modeling .",
    "the meshing of such a cavity is non - trivial , as the cavity has a gap of only a few micrometers with an extreme aspect ratio of the cavity s overall size to the gap spacing , which can be greater than 100 .",
    "we can not create a too small mesh size for the whole cavity because of the memory required and cpu time to calculate and store the solutions .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to mesh differently depending on this aspect ratio . in the meantime",
    ", meshes were optimized according to the ratio of the electric and magnetic stored - energy integrals of the entire cavity .",
    "the difference between the two stored - energy integrals depends on the mesh size .",
    "finer meshes result in better agreement .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows an example of such mesh plots around the two gap regions in a rr cavity .",
    "( a ) gap region at the top of the central post ; ( b ) gap region at the top of the ring.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we found the first two tm modes of the rr cavity had analogous field patterns to the fundamental tm mode of the sp cavity .",
    "all three modes have the same dominant field components : the axial electric field , @xmath13 , and the azimuthal magnetic field , @xmath14 . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows comparisons of these field distributions within the gap regions ( which in this case is 20 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the terms _ mode 1 _ and _ mode 2 _ in the figure represent the fundamental tm mode ( @xmath15 ) and the first high - order tm mode ( @xmath16 ) , respectively .",
    "one can see that most of electric energy is retained in the gap regions , with the stronger @xmath13 field in the central post gap region .",
    "however , the electric filling factors between this two gap regions are determined by the cavity dimensions . from the field plots we can see by inserting the ring ,",
    "two tm modes are created . within the ring",
    "both modes have nearly identical @xmath9 and @xmath13 field patterns , with intense @xmath9 field around the central post region .",
    "however , in the exterior ring region , the @xmath9 and @xmath13 fields of the two modes are orientated in opposite directions , with the @xmath16 mode changing sign .",
    "it is noted that the field components of the sp cavity are approximately equal to the average of the field of the two modes in the rr cavity .     and",

    "fig.[fig : fig5 ] illustrates the evolution of the field patterns as the gap size changes from over 1 mm down to 1 @xmath1 m .",
    "it is clear that three of the modes are transformed from the @xmath6 modes of the empty cylinder to the tm modes of reentrant cavity during the process .",
    "one important application of the reentrant cavity is that of a highly sensitive transducer to measure very weak forces and tiny displacements . to achieve maximum displacement sensitivity",

    "for example , most hybrid quantum engineered schemes now utilise more than one cavity mode , and need high tunability .",
