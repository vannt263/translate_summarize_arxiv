    "the identification and study of quasars at high redshift provides key diagnostic information on the early universe . over the last few years",
    "the relationship between high redshift quasars and local galaxies has been given an impetus from the realization that quiescent black holes may lie at the centre of all local bulges including the milky way ( e.g. magorrian etal , 1998 ) .",
    "the formation and evolution of massive black holes is fast becoming a main stream topic in theories of galaxy formation and evolution ( haehnelt , natarajan and rees @xcite ; kauffmann and haehnelt @xcite ) .",
    "high redshift quasars are also an important contributor to the uv radiation field in the early universe . specifically the lack of an optically thick , gunn - peterson trough in the spectra of high redshift objects ( e.g. songaila , hu , cowie , mcmahon @xcite ) .",
    "implies that the universe is highly ionized at z@xmath95.5 .",
    "estimates by madau@xcite indicate that if the ionization is due to starlight the inferred star formation rate at z=5 must be comparable to or greater than the observed value at z=3 . the direct detection of galaxies at z@xmath93 via the lyman break technique and the detection of measurable lyman continuum photons that escape these galaxies ( steidel , pettini and adelberger @xcite ) has raised a question over whether quasars or galaxies are the origin of the uv photons that re - ionized the universe at z@xmath06 .",
    "recent theoretical work ( miralda - escude , haehnelt and rees @xcite ; madau , haardt and rees @xcite ) indicates that a gunn - peterson trough should be present by z@xmath96 .",
    "a major uncertainty in all of this work is a measure of the ionizing background from quasars . the current uncertainty in the contribution of quasars to the uv background is predominantly caused by the unconstrained faint end of the luminosity function .    the resent discovery of several z@xmath05 quasars by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss fan @xcite ) will constrain the bright end ( i@xmath120.0 ) of the high redshift luminosity function .",
    "we are undertaking a survey 1 - 2 magnitudes fainter than the sdss program with the aim of constraining the space density and evolution of lower luminosity quasars where the majority of the ionizing flux arises . in this paper we present results from the first @xmath910deg@xmath10 of our survey . unless stated otherwise we use conventional vega magnitudes and h@xmath1150 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , q@xmath13=0.5 .",
    "we are using data from the isaac newton telescope(int ) wide angle survey ( was ) ( mcmahon @xcite ; http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath9wfcsur/. the survey is carried out with the prime focus wide field camera ( wfc ; ives , tulloch and churchill @xcite ) at the 2.5 m int .",
    "the wfc consists of a close packed mosaic of 4 thinned eev42 2kx4k ccds . with a pixel size of 13.5  corresponding to 0.33/pixel and effective field of view of 0.25deg@xmath10 .",
    "the survey consists of single 600secs exposures in 5 wavebands ( @xmath14 ) over an area @xmath9100deg@xmath10 to a nominal 5@xmath15 limiting magnitude(vega ) of 23 , 25 , 24 , 23 and 22 respectively .",
    "the ccd mosaic data from all survey runs is pipeline processed in cambridge ( irwin and lewis @xcite ) to produce photometrically and astrometrically calibrated images ( rms(internal)=0.1  ) , and morphologically classified merged multicolour catalogues .",
    "a preliminary photometric calibration has been applied to the data to the @xmath5 0.1 magnitude level . for the current work we have only used data with seeing of @xmath11.67 arcsec ( fwhm of 5 pixels ) and stellar ellipticity ( due to trailing ) of better than @xmath10.2 since this defines a practical upper limit for reliable image morphological classification .",
    "the current quasar candidate sample has a magnitude limit of @xmath16 or @xmath17@xmath1821 , the practical limit for acceptable signal - to - noise spectra with a 4 m class telescope in 1800 seconds of observation .    at the time of the spectroscopic",
    "follow  up observations in june 2000 , object catalogues for data taken between august 1998 and october 1999 were available .",
    "this data is taken from two regions of the survey .",
    "the first region covers the iso elais n1 field at j1610 + 5430 ( oliver @xcite ) , the second region is in the vicinity of at j2240 + 0000 . a total area of 12.5 deg@xmath10 has been used .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     refs : 1 .",
