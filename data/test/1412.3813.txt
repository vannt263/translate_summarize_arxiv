    "the physical properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) are coupled to the star life cycles and affect the dynamics of the galaxy ; therefore , the understanding of the ism composition and phases has broad relevance .",
    "the ism has been studied by a variety of observational techniques , e.g. 21  cm radio emission @xcite , ir @xcite , and uv absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "x - ray high - resolution spectroscopy has lately become an attractive method as it provides data that are unique and complementary to those gathered with other techniques . by using a bright continuum - dominated x - ray source as a backlight and grating spectrometers , e.g. the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) or the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrograph ( rgs )",
    ", it is possible through the modeling of the observed absorption features to unravel key ism physical and chemical conditions . due to the penetrating power of x - rays through the gas and dust",
    ", high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy allows the direct measurement of spectral features such as absorption lines and edges that lead to the identification of multiple atomic ionization species , molecules , solid composites , and to the determination of binding energies @xcite .",
    "reliable templates are thus needed to diagnose the different absorption signatures in such a diverse and complex plasma .",
    "useful photoabsorption models to render the ism features have been progressively refined and incorporated in the x - ray spectral fitting packages .",
    "wabs , a model included in the xspec x - ray fitting package , was based on a compilation @xcite of the photoabsorption cross sections by @xcite , and included the solar abundances of @xcite ; however , it neglected contributions from ions , molecules , grains , and abundance enhancements . due to this latter limitation ,",
    "@xcite energy fitted these cross sections for 17 elements in a model referred to as phabs , allowing the treatment of abundances as adjustable parameters . within the xspec spectral fitting package @xcite , tbabs considered improved cross sections and revised abundances as well as contributions from grains and the h@xmath0 molecule @xcite . in order to comply with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectral requirements , an updated version of this model ( tbnew ) has been available , which implements finer cross - section meshes to delineate the resonance structures of the oxygen and neon k edges and the iron l edge .",
    "it must be noted that all these models only consider photoabsorption by neutral atomic species . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have analyzed ism absorption in low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) spectra with the spex package using three absorption models that assume ionization and energy balance : hot for collisionally ionized plasmas ; slab for plasmas with arbitrary compositions ; and amol that takes into account the effects of dust and molecules .",

    "spectral fits were performed with xspec using a physical model referred to as warmabs , which is based on precalculated tabulations of ionic fractions and level populations from the xstar photoionization code to generate synthetic emission and transmission spectra . in this work , a model benchmark of the theoretical atomic data for oxygen ions by @xcite required wavelength shifts for both the k lines and photoionization cross sections in order to fit the observed spectra accurately . moreover , an attempt to develop a definitive absorption model for neutral oxygen with a new computed cross section revealed standing discrepancies between the laboratory and observed line positions @xcite .",
    "the warmabs model has been subsequently used with the adjusted cross sections of @xcite and @xcite to analyze ism oxygen absorption toward eight lmxbs @xcite .",
    "oxygen abundances and ionization parameters along different lines of sight were therein determined , finding only small abundance differences due to the theoretical atomic data , and estimating the @xmath17(o  ii)/@xmath17(o ) column - density ratio to be around 10% .",
    "in the case of magnesium , new photoabsorption cross sections by @xcite in warmabs were used to fit the mg  k edge in _ xmm - newton _ spectra of the lmxb gs  1826238 predicting that most of this element was in ionized form .",
    "the warmabs model includes the most accurate atomic data for atomic neutrals and ions , but it is constrained by the assumption of ionization equilibrium .",
    "this may not be practical owing to deviations in the ionizing energy distribution , other ionization mechanisms , or the superposition of multiple components along the line of sight .",
    "hence , we present a model of ism x - ray absorption , to be referred to as ismabs , that takes into account both neutrals and charged ions allowing their column densities to vary as free parameters .",
    "we benchmark ismabs by means of fits to high - resolution spectra from x - ray binary sources obtained with the _ chandra _ hetgs and comparisons with the tbnew and warmabs models .",
    "this procedure has involved a detailed study of the oxygen and neon k edges as well as the iron l edge .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_dat ] the data reduction process",
    "is briefly summarized , and in section  [ sec_mod ] we describe the selected atomic database and the x - ray absorption model developed to render the ism absorption features . in section  [ sec_fit_mo ]",
    "we show fit comparisons of the tbnew and ismabs models .",
    "results obtained from the broadband fit are reviewed in section  [ sec_broad ] , with particular attention to the neon k- and iron l - edge regions , followed by a detailed discussion of the fits in section  [ sec_results ] .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ appendix ] we give an account of the importance of ionization balance in abundance determinations .",
    "the most suitable sources for x - ray ism studies are bright lmxbs as they do not usually show intrinsic spectral features , and preferably with photon fluxes with high signal - to - noise ratios to enable the measurement of the ism contribution . to hone the present photoabsorption model , we have selected eight candidates from the catalog of lmxbs @xcite and the transmission grating catalog and archive ( tgcat ) such that the total number of counts in each hetgs spectrum is greater than @xmath18 .",
    "we have also included spectra from the high - mass x - ray binary cygnus  x1 due to its high photon flux , giving a total of 25 observations .",
    "observational details are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , where it is worth adding that the high - energy resolution of the _ chandra _ gratings is certainly indispensable in the present modeling developments .",
    "the spectra have been reduced with the standard ciao threads , the zero - order position being estimated in each case with the findzo algorithm .",
    "spectral fitting was carried out with the xspec package ( version 12.8.1 ) .",

    "for this purpose , @xcite developed the tbabs and tbnew absorption models that have been widely used in the last decade .",
    "however , they only include neutral atomic species compromising their ability to render complex ism spectral structures such as the o , ne , and mg k edges @xcite . given this limitation ,",
    "we have devised a new ism x - ray absorption model  to be referred to as ismabs  that compiles the most accurate atomic data available for neutrally , singly , and doubly ionized species of h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar and ca ; in the case of iron , an experimental cross section has been chosen to model the l - edge absorption region ( see section  [ db ] ) .    photoabsorption in ismabs takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the observed spectrum , @xmath29 the spectrum emitted by the source , and @xmath30 is the absorption coefficient .",
    "the optical depth @xmath31 is usually defined as @xmath32 @xmath33 being the total photoionization cross section comprising all the atoms and @xmath34 is the hydrogen column density .",
    "if a neutral gas is considered , @xmath35 may be written @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the photoionization cross section of a chemical element with atomic number @xmath38 , and @xmath39 gives its abundance relative to hydrogen .",
    "it is worth noting that , due to the abundance dependency on column density , there is a degeneracy between @xmath39 and @xmath34 , making it possible by varying one or the other to obtain multiple solutions in the calculation of @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , we prefer to adopt the following definition for @xmath31 : @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the cross section and column density for the @xmath43-th ion .",
    "we therefore manage the ion column densities , including @xmath34 , as model parameters in order to determine @xmath31 , thus avoiding any parametric ambivalence .",
    "ismabs always assumes that @xmath17 ( ) @xmath44()@xmath45 , and as a default , @xmath17 ( ) @xmath46 . but @xmath17 ( ) is a free parameter which the user can modify if desired . it must be emphasized that there are no changes to the cross sections during fitting except for interpolation ; i.e. they are read just once by the code when the model is invoked .",
    "the energy range covered by the model is @xmath47  kev .",
    "the redshift @xmath48 is also a model parameter , and we will include turbulent broadening in the next revision to ismabs ( with the turbulence velocity @xmath49 as the model parameter in units of kms@xmath50 ) ; however , observations point to a turbulence ( @xmath51  kms@xmath50 ) that can not be detected by _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for this velocity range , the natural broadening of inner - shell resonances dominate over turbulence broadening .",
    "ismabs has been specially developed for x - ray fitting packages such as xspec @xcite , isis @xcite and sherpa @xcite .",
    "in addition to high signal - to - noise x - ray spectra from a back - light source , reliable atomic data are required to model the ism absorption signatures .",
    "the atomic databases used by many of the currently available x - ray absorption models are not complete and of sufficient accuracy to model grating - resolution spectra . this situation was illustrated in the work of @xcite , who used four high - resolution _ chandra _ spectra of the lmxb xte  j1817330 to benchmark the oxygen theoretical atomic database @xcite in the xstar photoionization code .",
    "the photoabsorption cross sections of the lowly ionized species required several adjustments : wavelength shifts of the k@xmath52 resonances in o  i ( @xmath53 m ) and o  ii ( @xmath54 m ) and of the whole cross sections for both of these ions . moreover , a new and more accurate theoretical cross section for o  i by @xcite showed significant differences in the oscillator - strength distribution , and brought to light a discrepancy in the wavelength scale , namely @xmath55  m , between the observed k@xmath52 line position and the laboratory measurement @xcite .",
    "the quantitative differences in photoabsorption modeling brought about by these two o  i cross sections , i.e. @xcite and @xcite , were examined by @xcite in a study of ism absorption along several lines of sight , constraining them to less than 5% in the average ionization parameter and oxygen abundance .",
    "a further point of interest is the presence of condensed matter in the ism , which can be detected through the analysis of x - ray absorption fine structure in the form of spectral modulations near the photoabsorption edges , and by the absence of strong inner - shell resonance transitions below the ionization threshold @xcite ; however , their proper characterization would require beforehand the mastering of the atomic absorption edges which is the central topic of the present work .      in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we list the reference sources for the cross sections incorporated in ismabs .",
    "we include the theoretical atomic photoabsorption data for  by @xcite ; and by @xcite for the singly and doubly ionized species of si , s , ar , and ca , which were calculated with the @xmath56-matrix method using an optical potential to account for auger damping .",
    "for the neutral species of the latter four elements , we adopt , in the absence of better data , the theoretical cross sections of @xcite even though they do not take into account the inner - shell resonances that give rise to the k - edge structures .",
    "these cross sections are also used for the neutral , singly , and doubly ionized species of c. for oxygen ions , we select the theoretical cross section for by @xcite and those by @xcite for and , including the corrections specified by @xcite as previously mentioned . in the case of neon , we take the @xmath56-matrix data ( including auger damping ) by @xcite for and by @xcite for and . for the magnesium ions ,  , we take the photoabsorption cross sections computed by @xcite with the @xmath56-matrix method that account for orbital relaxation effects to reduce a previous over - estimate of the k - edge position @xcite .    in the case of iron ,",
    "@xcite fitted the l - edge region using the experimental cross section of metallic iron by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite adjusted the l  edge using the atomic data for the neutral by @xcite , but included a molecular solid component since the edge can not be fitted with a pure gas model . using _",
    "hetg spectra from five x - ray binaries , @xcite adjusted the iron l  edge in the tbnew absorption model with the experimental cross section @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the metallic iron measurements @xcite but with a wavelength correction of @xmath57  m .",
    "this shift was originally suggested by @xcite , who argued that the energy resolution of the laboratory data in combination with the hetg absolute instrumental wavelength accuracy would allow it .",
    "we also considered the widely used atomic fe l - shell cross section of @xcite , but the resulting spectral fit was inferior to that obtained with the shifted cross section of @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that both warmabs and ismabs use the same atomic database except for fe since warmabs uses the fe cross - section of @xcite .",

    "it may be noted that the k@xmath52 position as well as those with @xmath91 are displaced with respect to the observations , and the cross sections of and also show similar displacements . in this respect ,",
    "@xcite have previously indicated a similar wavelength offset using high - resolution _ chandra _ spectra . in what follows",
    "we have adjusted the k@xmath52 resonance positions , and shifted the cross sections for the continuum and higher resonances for these three species in order to obtain the best possible agreement with the observed lines .",
    "the shifts are , respectively , @xmath92 m  and @xmath93 m  for the ne  ii and ne  iii k@xmath52 resonances ; and @xmath94 m  , @xmath95 m , and @xmath96 m  for the ne  i , ne  ii and ne  iii cross sections .",

    "in this section we compare two different x - ray absorption models , namely tbnew and ismabs , the former including photoionization cross sections for elements with atomic number @xmath97 @xcite and the contribution from molecules and interstellar grains .",
    "it therefore favors the modeling of the observed extinction and depletions in the diffuse ism .",
    "model parameters are the hydrogen column density ( @xmath34 in units of @xmath98 ) , elemental abundances ( @xmath99 relative to solar ) , and the redshift ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , tbnew only takes into account neutral atomic species , and therefore , the warm or ionized ism phases can not be adequately modeled .",

    "the bottom panels depict fit residuals in units of @xmath90 .",
    "it is clear that the ismabs residuals are smaller particulary around the neon and oxygen edges . in the fe l - edge region",
    "the residuals are similar since both models use the same experimental atomic data , although small differences are noted perhaps due to the continuum .",
    "it is found that the inclusion of charged ions in addition to neutrals leads to a significant improvement in the fits .",
    "the difference in the statistics is of @xmath114 if the fit is performed with ismabs , with 4 new free parameters .",
    "moreover , as shown in table  [ tab4 ] , if only the column densities for neutrals are considered ( i.e. considering the same number of free parameters ) , both models give similar results , however the ismabs model performs a better fit , with @xmath115 , due to the higher accuracy in the atomic data included .",
    "following @xcite , we have performed a broadband fit ( 1124  ) of all the spectra listed in table  [ tab1 ] using ismabs and a power - law model .",
    "we rebin the data to at least 20 counts per channel in order to use @xmath111 statistics . for each source , all observations are fitted simultaneously varying the power - law normalization and photon index , thus accounting for possible continuum variations between observations that are always detected .",
    "the h , o , ne , and fe column densities , as well as those of o and ne ions , are taken as free parameters in ismabs .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] show the best ismabs fits in the 1124    interval . in the case of sco  x1",
    "the fit was performed in the 1524    interval as there are no counts below @xmath116   . for each source",
    "the observations have been combined for illustrative purposes .",
    "it must be noted that , even though this figure looks similar to figure  1 of @xcite , it is now obtained with our new photoabsorption model .",
    "table  [ tab5 ] lists the fit results where it may be appreciated that ismabs yields the ion column densities directly , and a statistically acceptable fit is obtained for each source .",
    "a comparison of the present hydrogen column densities with previous results is given in table  [ tab6 ] finding satisfactory agreement , i.e. within the error bars .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the column - density variations around cygnus  x1 are not resolved in the 21  cm survey ; therefore , the values derived by means of spectral fits should be more reliable .",
    "a zoom of the broadband fit in the interval 1315    is depicted in figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] ( sco  x1 is excluded for lack of counts below @xmath116   ) .",
    "it may be seen that the absorption features in this wavelength region are more complex than a simple edge : k@xmath52 absorption lines of and are detected at @xmath117   and @xmath118  , respectively , as well as k@xmath64 from , , and ( @xmath119  , @xmath120  , and @xmath121  , respectively ) .",
    "the line at @xmath122  , attributed to k@xmath58 , is observed in all sources .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of such lines justifies the inclusion of accurate cross sections for and in ismabs in order to procure reliable spectral fits ; for instance , in figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] low residuals are found around the k@xmath64 and k@xmath58 lines at @xmath120   and @xmath123  , respectively .",
    "furthermore , a similar zoom is shown in figures  [ fig8 ] and  [ fig9 ] of the fe  l edge ( 1718.5   ) which benchmarks the cross section adopted in ismabs ( see section  [ db ] ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that the selected cross section for was obtained from measurements of solid iron , and it seems to fit the observations adequately .",
    "this finding supports previous assertions that most of the fe in the ism is in solid form @xcite .",
    "we have developed a new spectral model , referred to as ismabs , to fit ism x - ray absorption that takes into account photoabsorption cross sections for neutrally , singly , and doubly ionized species of cosmically abundant elements , namely h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe . in other words , ismabs enables the determination of the ion column densities directly . although the predominant component of the ism is the neutral gas , the inclusion of singly and doubly ionized species provides improved fits when compared with a model ( e.g. tbnew ) that only accounts for neutral absorption .",
    "this shows that the understanding of the relevant atomic systems and processes , as well as the accuracy and completeness of the relevant atomic data , are both crucial to avoid incorrect interpretations of the absorption structures detected in x - ray high resolution spectra .",
    "this may occur in studies of ism x - ray absorption that rely on fits with gaussian profiles .",

    "we also obtain the average ratio @xmath158 which is lower than solar , namely @xmath159 @xcite and @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to either ism fe depletion or ne overabundance .",
    "in fact , as previously discussed , we have found a ne abundance greater than solar in the lines of sight toward 4u  163653 , 4u  173544 , gx  9 + 9 , and xte  j1817330 .",
    "the @xmath155 ratio by @xcite ( @xmath161 ) , on the other hand , is in a fair agreement with ismabs .",
    "a further comparison of the iron and oxygen column densities finds the ismabs ratio @xmath162 in close agreement with the solar ratio of @xcite ( @xmath163 ) but somewhat lower than that by @xcite ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "future analysis of the fe k - edge absorption region would indeed help to constrain the ism fe abundance fractions in order to settle this issue .",
    "the high - resolution x - ray spectra toward eight lmxbs have been analyzed .",
    "this study involved a broadband fit with ismabs to constrain the hydrogen column density , finding good agreement with previous work .",
    "then , a simultaneous fit of the neon- and iron - edge regions was performed for each source , where the resulting column densities indicate the presence of a lowly ionized gas along the different lines of sight .",
    "we intend to carry out in the near future a more extensive analysis of ism photoabsorption using all the grating spectra from x - ray binaries available from the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ archives .",
    "our target is to create a library of column densities and abundances for all the detectable atomic species in these spectra .",
    "we believe that once the atomic k edges are fully analyzed and modeled , the search for molecular and dust spectral features can be pursued in earnest , a topic of current interest in ism astrophysics .",
    "finally , the present ismabs model can be downloaded for use in x - ray data analysis packages such as xspec @xcite , isis @xcite and sherpa @xcite .",

    "here we discuss the differences in fitting spectra with the ismabs and warmabs models , the latter as implemented in previous work @xcite .",
    "an important complication affecting our modeling concerns the smooth background photoelectric absorption which can not be identified uniquely by spectral features .",
    "this background is always present , and arises from hydrogen , helium , and valence - shell absorption by the same ions responsible for the edges and resonance absorption lines .",
    "since all these mechanisms produce a smooth opacity , it is impossible to distinguish them uniquely . if the gas is assumed to be in ionization balance , then the relative columns of neutral h , , and are determined ; if not , it is important to be aware of the degeneracy between the smooth absorption produced by h , , and .",
    "this degeneracy is illustrated graphically in figure  [ fig11 ] , which shows the @xmath111 contours of the fit to the xte  j1817330 spectrum for various combinations of the h and column densities .",
    "the solid curves show contours of constant @xmath111 spaced at @xmath234 .",
    "this clearly illustrates that the combinations of these variables lying along the diagonal are equivalent while those that fit the data have an almost exact inverse relationship .",
    "this obvious behavior must be understood and accounted for when deriving abundances relative to h or he in x - ray spectral fitting . in the results reported in the main body of this paper , which are based on ismabs , we have assumed that all the smooth opacity in the x - ray band comes from h + and that the column densities are negligible .",
    "the warmabs model includes the results of a photoionization equilibrium calculation , and therefore , the h and column densities are tied together .",
    "the value taken from the warmabs fit of the xte  j1817330 spectrum is shown with a dot in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "this corresponds to an ionization parameter of @xmath235 for which the column density of neutral h + is 10.8 times that of ; i.e. , the equilibrium assumption removes the degeneracy between the two variables .",
    "a quantity of interest associated to the fitting of interstellar x - ray absorption spectra is the abundance of elements such as oxygen and neon relative to hydrogen .",
    "if the smooth background absorption in the x - ray band were solely due to neutral h , then the h and o or ne column densities derived from the fits could be used to derive the relevant abundance ratios by simply taking column - density ratios .",
    "the degeneracy between and h complicates this procedure since the total h column density can not be uniquely determined .",
    "this is shown graphically in figure  [ fig11 ] with the vertical dashed curves which are curves of constant o abundance relative to h for the fit to the spectra of xte  j1817330 .",
    "the curves are labeled according to the conventional notation : @xmath236=0 $ ] corresponds to the solar oxygen abundance @xcite , @xmath236=1 $ ] to @xmath237 solar , etc .",
    "this shows that , although acceptable fits can be obtained for any value of @xmath34 in the range up to @xmath238  @xmath98 , the inferred abundance of o relative to h can take any value from 0.75 solar to 10 times solar .    finally , we mention the unavoidable limitation that different numerical model implementations , even if they are based on the same atomic data , inevitably differ due to numerical details .",
    "for example , calculations in ismabs use cross sections tabulated on a grid that is finer than most instrumental grids , but which inevitably requires interpolation or smoothing to produce a model for xspec .",
    "warmabs , on the other hand , adopts such tabulations for some cross sections while for others analytic expressions are employed .",
    "examples of the latter are the all - important cross sections for neutral o , ne , and mg of @xcite . also , is important to note that the fe cross - sections are different between both models , ismabs uses @xcite cross - section while warmabs uses @xcite cross section .",
    "small numerical differences in the cross section or opacity are exponentially amplified in the transmission coefficient which is most closely related to the observed spectrum .",
    "thus , in spite of efforts to minimize numerical differences between codes , they are unavoidable at some level and it is useful to attempt to quantify them .",
    "to summarize , we identify the three principal issues that affect the quantitative results of fitting to interstellar absorption and model comparisons : ( i ) the importance of ions and whether they are treated in equilibrium ratios or not ; ( ii ) the ambiguity associated to the smooth background ; and ( iii ) numerical implementation issues .",
    "we now proceed to illustrate them with quantitative examples .    in figure  [ fig12 ]",
    "we show a comparison of the ion column densities derived from fitting to xte  j1817330 with warmabs and ismabs . in the case of warmabs",
    ", we adopt two ionization components with @xmath239 and @xmath235 , both with a column density of 10@xmath240  @xmath98 .",
    "the elemental abundances for the two components are allowed to vary freely in order to obtain the best fit .",
    "the four observations of this source are fitted simultaneously , and all the absorption parameters ( i.e. the warmabs ionization parameters , column densities , elemental abundances , turbulent velocities , and redshifts ) are forced to be the same for all the different observations . the continuum is taken to be the sum of a black body and a power law , and the parameters of these components are allowed to differ between the various observations to reflect source variability .",
    "the best fit has a @xmath241 .",
    "warmabs can output a list of ion column densities ( even though these are not free parameters ) , and in figure  [ fig12 ] we show a comparison of the warmabs ion column densities with those from an ismabs fit . in the latter",
    "the h and column densities are fixed at the values taken from the warmabs fit .",
    "we take the column densities from all the ions from the warmabs best fit and put them into ismabs .",
    "this includes the h , , and column densities . using the same continuum parameters we obtain @xmath242 .",
    "this @xmath111 difference is likely to be numerical since all other parameters of the two fits are identical .",
    "we then allow the ion column densities in ismabs and the continuum parameters to vary freely in order to obtain the best fit .",
    "in doing so we do not allow the h , , and column densities to vary , and we preserve the restriction that the absorption model is the same for all observations .",
    "this procedure produces a fit with @xmath243 .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows the ratio of the column densities derived from these two different methods .",
    "this represents both an astrophysical experiment on whether the ratios show photoionization equilibrium , and in some sense , a test of model accuracy ( note that the si and s column densities are negligible in both fits , so they are omitted ) .",
    "the two fits agree to within the error bars for most ions , a notable exception being for which the warmabs model predicts a significantly lower column density than ismabs .",
    "this indicates the existence of a component in the absorbing gas toward this source which is more highly ionized than the equilibrium gas that can actually fit most neutrals and singly ionized species .",
    "oxygen shows such an effect more clearly than other elements due to its relatively high abundance .",
    "a further step in exploring the effects of ionization equilibrium in absorption fitting is to sum the ion column densities derived from the fits with and without equilibrium ( i.e. using warmabs or ismabs ) to get elemental abundances .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig13 ] where the ratio of elemental abundances are obtained by summing up the ismabs ion column densities to the elemental abundances obtained from the warmabs column densities .",
    "the abundances shown here for ismabs make use of the h and column densities derived by warmabs .",
    "also shown are the ratio of the ismabs abundances to the values in the compilation by @xcite .",
    "this shows that , in spite of the disagreement for , both fitting methods yield abundances that are consistent with each other and with the compilation .",
    "however , the ne abundance in this source is an exception ; ismabs manifests a tendency to produce larger abundances since it is capable of accounting for ion absorption that is not tied up to the ionization equilibrium assumption ."
