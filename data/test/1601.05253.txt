    "as has been pointed out previously by harney @xcite , finite vector analyzing powers @xmath3 arise in reaction processes only , if at least two different partial waves interfere . hence in case of an isolated @xmath4-channel resonance , which is formed by a single partial wave matching to spin and parity of the resonance , the analyzing powers in the resonance region will be vanishing small , if there is no sizeable interfering background from other reaction processes .    recently , in the reaction @xmath5 a pronounced , narrow resonance structure corresponding to a mass of 2.38 gev and a width of about 70 mev has been observed in the total cross section near @xmath6 2.4 gev ( @xmath7 = 1.2 gev ) @xcite .",
    "its quantum numbers have been determined to be @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-channel character of this resonance has been established recently by polarized @xmath9 scattering .",
    "inclusion of these new data into the said partial - wave analysis produces a pole in the coupled @xmath10-@xmath11 partial - waves at ( @xmath12 ) mev @xcite . since then this resonance is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath13 channel is the @xmath2 decay channel with the smallest amount of background from other reaction processes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it has sizeable contributions from @xmath14-channel @xmath15 and @xmath16 excitations .",
    "both of them are very well known from the study of @xmath17-induced two - pion production @xcite .",
    "hence , due to the finite background amplitudes we may expect sizeable analyzing powers @xmath18 in the region of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "also , they are expected to increase with increasing energy due to the increasing contribution of higher partial waves .",
    "since @xmath18 is composed only of interference terms of partial waves , it is sensitive to even small partial - wave contributions and therefore qualifies as a sensitive spectroscopic tool for the investigation of the @xmath2 resonance region .",
    "in order to investigate this issue in a comprehensive way we measured the basic _ isoscalar _ double - pionic fusion process @xmath0 exclusively and kinematically complete .",
    "the experiment was carried out with the wasa detector setup @xcite at cosy via the reaction @xmath19 using a polarized deuteron beam at the lab energy @xmath20 = 2.27 gev . since due to fermi motion of the nucleons in the beam deuteron the quasifree reaction proceeds via a range of effective collision energies , we cover the energy region 2.30 gev @xmath21 2.47 gev .",
    "the emerging deuterons as well as the fast , quasifree scattered spectator protons were detected in the forward detector of wasa and identified by the @xmath22e - e technique .",
    "gammas from the @xmath23 decay were detected in the central detector .    that way the full four - momenta were determined for all particles of an event . since the reaction was measured kinematically overdetermined , kinematic fits with 6 overconstraints",
    "could be performed for each event . from the full kinematic information available for each event also the relevant total energy in the @xmath24 system",
    "could be reconstructed for each event individually .    by just having a different trigger these measurements",
    "have been obtained in parallel to the ones for @xmath24 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the trigger used for the detection of the @xmath13 events required at least one hit in the forward detector and three neutral hits in the central detector .    for details of the experiment , in particular also with respect to the determination of the beam polarization , checks for quasifree scattering and the procedure for deriving @xmath18 from the data , see ref .",

    "the intermediate @xmath22 from the process @xmath31 has been reconstructed from the 4-momenta of its decay products @xmath23 and nucleon  the latter by taking half the deuteron momentum , thereby neglecting the small correction due to fermi motion of the nucleons inside the deuteron . since the dalitz plot displayed in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite exhibits a @xmath22 excitation band sitting upon no substantial background , no cut on the @xmath22 mass appears to be necessary .",
    "the data have been binned into three energy bins as displayed in figs .  1 - 3 : @xmath25  =  2.30  -  2.35  gev with center of gravity at 2.34  gev , @xmath25  =   2.36  -  2.40  gev with centroid at 2.38  gev and @xmath25  =  2.41  -  2.47  gev centered at 2.42  gev .",
    "the middle one corresponds to the maximum cross section of the @xmath2 resonance , whereas the other two roughly correspond to its half maximum . at the lowest energy bin",
    "the analyzing power in dependence of the deuteron scattering angle is still small .",
    "however , substantial @xmath18 values are obtained at the two higher energy bins .    in the following the description of the data",
    "is based on the formalism outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on that work @xmath18 angular dependencies",
    "have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be theoretically expected in @xmath17 induced , _",
    "i.e. _ purely isovector two - pion production , if there are only relative @xmath4- and @xmath32- waves in the final channel :    @xmath33    with the parameters a and b to be adjusted to the data .    for the @xmath5 reaction",
    "the situation changes insofar as we deal here with a purely isoscalar channel .",
    "in addition @xmath34-waves have to be included , in order to allow the formation of @xmath1 . for simplicity",
    "we assume the @xmath35 system to be in relative @xmath4-wave .",
    "at least for the resonance formation this is well justified @xcite . applying the formalism presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to this situation @xcite we again end up with a formal description in terms of @xmath36 :    @xmath37    due to the involvement of @xmath34-waves the sum runs now over 4 terms ( j = 1 , ... 4 ) from @xmath38 until @xmath39 .",
    "the weighting parameters @xmath40 ... @xmath41 to be adjusted to the data have now the following meaning :    @xmath42    here @xmath43 denotes the momentum of the @xmath35 system relative to the deuteron and the strength parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the transitions :    @xmath46    where on the left - hand side the @xmath47 partial wave in the entrance channel is given by its spectroscopic nomenclature .",
    "the right - hand side denotes the partial wave of the deuteron together with its angular momentum relative to the @xmath35 system .",
    "the interference of these partial waves , which are abbreviated by @xmath4 , @xmath32 and @xmath34 , is indicated in brackets at the right - hand side of eq .",
    "note that in the entrance channel @xmath48 and @xmath49 as well as @xmath10 and @xmath11 are coupled partial waves . in principle , also the @xmath48 - @xmath49 coupled waves contribute to the @xmath50 configurations .",
    "however , for simplicity we omit this contribution , since it is expected to be small compared to the contribution of the @xmath2 resonance .    in order to see how many terms in the expansion ( 3 )",
    "are needed by the data , we performed fits with 2 , 3 and 4 terms as given in tables 1 - 3 and shown in figs . 1 - 3 by the dotted , solid and dashed lines , respectively .    for the analyzing power in dependence of the deuteron scattering angle the latter two are very close together in the angular regions , which are well covered by data .",
    "this means that a 3-parameter fit is already appropriate for a proper description of the data . for the lowest energy , where the data are very close to zero throughout the measured angular range , already the 2-parameter fit is sufficient with providng a @xmath51 per degree of freedom ( ndf ) of unity",
    "the fact that already a 3-parameter fit is sufficient for an appropriate description of the data in the resonance region is in accordance with the new said solution , which exhibits the @xmath2 pole predominantly in the @xmath10 wave and only very weakly in @xmath11 .",
    "hence @xmath45 got to be small and @xmath41 negligible compared to @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , the resonance term @xmath52 is highly demanded by the data , as the comparison between dashed and dotted curves demonstrates . since @xmath52 enters also in @xmath40 , the latter",
    "is also requested by the fit , whereas @xmath53 turns out compatible with zero within uncertainties at resonance .",
    "therefore , the leading contribution to the analyzing power of the @xmath28 angular distribution turns out to be the interference of the resonant @xmath34 wave with the non - resonant @xmath32 wave .",

[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      +    the @xmath43-dependence of the parameters makes it plausible that the analyzing power is smallest at the lowest energy @xmath25 = 2.34 gev and tends to level off as soon as the resonance maximum is reached . at 2.42 gev the resonance amplitude is already substantially reduced , however , the @xmath43-dependence in @xmath40 and @xmath52 counteracts this reduction .    for the @xmath29 dependence of the analyzing power we may stick with the same ansatz eq .",
    "( 2 ) , but need to reinterpret the transitions ( 4 ) with respect to the partition @xmath54  -  @xmath23 . with still having",
    "the @xmath55 system coupled to zero , this means that the transitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 both represent configurations , where the @xmath23 is in relative @xmath32 wave to the @xmath54 system , _",
    "i.e. _ contain also resonance contributions .",
    "if we forget the somewhat erratic data point at small angles at @xmath25 = 2.34 gev , then we observe an approximately constant pattern over the energy region of interest , which can be described sufficiently well by already the first two terms in the expansion eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    finally ,",
    "for the @xmath16 partition we expect relative @xmath4-waves independent of whether this partition originates from @xmath2 or conventional @xmath14-channel excitation , since the considered energies are still below the nominal mass of two @xmath22 excitations .",
    "the observed @xmath18 distributions are similar to those for the @xmath54  -  @xmath23 partition and hence characterized dominantly by the @xmath53 contribution .      by using both the unpolarized and polarized runs of this experiment",
    "we may extract also ( unpolarized ) differential and total cross sections .",
    "this is valuable , since we used in this experiment the quasifree @xmath47 collision in reversed kinematics covering thus the lab system phase space complementary to what has been obtained in regular kinematics used previously @xcite .",
    "4 shows the @xmath58 angular dependence of the ( unpolarized ) differential cross section over the energy region @xmath25 = 2.33 - 2.43 gev binned into five intervals .",
    "the data plotted by the open circles have been obtained in a previous experiment @xcite by use of a proton beam hitting a deuterium target in quasi - free kinematics . due to the experimental conditions",
    "only the deuteron back - angles could be measured in good quality .",
    "now , with a deuteron beam impinging on a hydrogen target the phase space in the lab system is populated in a complementary way and we may deduce the cross sections preferably at forward angles ( solid circles ) . note that in fig .",
    "4 the data are plotted at angles mirrored to the way plotted in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", in this work , the angles are defined relative to the direction of the initial neutron , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite they have been defined relative to the direction of the initial proton .",
    "since we deal here with a purely isoscalar reaction , the unpolarized angular distributions have to be symmetric about @xmath59 in the cms ( barshay - temmer theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the data are in very good agreement with this requirement . to underline this , we show in fig .",
    "4 fits with an expansion into legendre polynomials of order 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 , _ i.e. _ including @xmath34-waves between d and @xmath55 systems and allowing total angular momenta up to @xmath60 = 3 :    @xmath61    where the coefficients @xmath62 denote the fit parameters .",
    "in addition to the symmetry about @xmath59 fig .",
    "4 demonstrates that the anisotropy is largest around the maximum of the @xmath2 resonance flattening off below and above .",
    "the fact that the angular distribution tends to flatten out towards lower energies is not unexpected , since close to threshold we expect contributions only from the lowest partial waves .",
    "the fact that the angular distribution tends to be flatter also at the high energy end of the investigated energy region , is not as trivial .",
    "it supports the fact that the high spin @xmath63 = 3 of the @xmath2 resonance requires a unusually large anisotropy of the angular distribution , which is larger than obtained in the conventional @xmath14-channel @xmath16 process , which gets the dominant mechanism at higher energies and where the @xmath16 system may also be in lower angular momentum configurations .",
