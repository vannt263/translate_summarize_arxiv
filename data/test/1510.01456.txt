    "the motivation of the relativistic heavy ion collider experiments is to explore the properties of strongly interacting matter ( partonic or hadronic ) at the finite temperature and/or density .",
    "the current heavy ion research facilities e.g ; relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) are focused in unveiling the properties of deconfined quark - gluon matter created at the extreme temperature and almost vanishing net baryon density  @xcite . at this regime",
    "the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) simulations have reported a crossover from hadronic to partonic phase and the existence of critical point where the first order phase transition line terminates  @xcite .",
    "thus rhic has initiated the beam energy scan program to find the location of critical point in the qcd phase diagram ( temperature ( t)- baryo - chemical potential ( ) plane )  @xcite .    in contrary to the above experiments , the future compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment at fair / gsi laboratory",
    "is aimed to explore another facet of qcd phase diagram ; at high baryon density ( @xmath1 times ground state nuclear matter density ) and moderate temperature  @xcite .",
    "the experiment would be playing a very significant role in the scientific quest of understanding the behaviour of qcd at high density regime .",
    "the facility is being designed to collide various species of heavy ions at fixed target mode with the anticipated beam energies 5 - 45 gev / nucleon .",
    "the diagnostic probes of the matter created in the collisions include ; ( i ) short lived vector mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) decaying to dilepton pairs , ( ii ) production of multi - strange hyperons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) ( iii ) dissociation of charmonium ( j/@xmath6 ) and charmed hadron ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) states , etc . the existence of first order phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter and restoration of chiral symmetry at the large is expected to be found from the fair energy scan program  @xcite .",
    "earlier experiments such as ; rhic - ags and cern - sps were aimed to explore above features through the measurement of bulk observables like ; flow and momentum spectra of hadrons .",
    "however their efforts were constrained due to limited beam luminosity . in recent years a similar research program ( nica ) at jinr - dubna has been proposed to explore phases of nuclear matter at high baryon density  @xcite .",
    "but the cbm experiment would be more efficient for the detection of bulk and rare probes , with the availability of high intensity ion beams  @xcite .    in order to compute the dynamic evolution of the matter created in such collisions ,",
    "we need macroscopic / microscopic models . the macroscopic models like ; hydrodynamics rely upon the assumption of local thermal equilibrium of the created matter on a certain time scale .",
    "the actual thermalization criterion has seldom been tested .",
    "there are a few works , addressed the issue at higher collision energies in the framework of perturbative qcd  @xcite or color - glass condensate theory  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand microscopic monte carlo models like : urqmd  @xcite , hsd  @xcite , ampt  @xcite work on the postulated interaction among it s constituents ( parton , hadron , or string ) and does not require any assumption of local thermal equilibrium . therefore , it is very important to test weather the dense baryonic matter created in these collisions achieve a local thermal equilibrium or not . in particular , we have investigated the time - scale of local thermal equilibration of non - strange and strange baryons in an elementary volume in phase - space from the time evolution of longitudinal - to - transverse pressure anisotropy and slope of the energy spectrum . for this purpose ,",
    "we have employed the microscopic , n - body transport model called ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) .",
    "we considered the most central collisions of gold ( au ) nuclei at four beam energies associated with the cbm experiment .",
    "the incident beam energy has obvious implication on the time - scale of equilibration , which can be found in the subsequent section .",
    "the organization of the paper goes as the following . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly recapitulate about the microscopic transport model urqmd and then discuss about the methodology of our analysis . in section 3 , we show the results for the time evolution of density , ratio of longitudinal - to - transverse pressure and inverse slope parameter of the energy spectrum for non - strange baryons , strange baryons and strange mesons . in section 4 , we have utilized the statistical thermal model to extract the post - equilibrium thermodynamic parameters e.g. , temperature , chemical potential and calculated the entropy density of the system .",
    "finally we have summarized the findings in section 5 .",
    "the model urqmd has been extensively used in recent years for describing heavy ion collisions of center of mass energy ranging from few gev/ nucleon to few tev/ nucleon  @xcite .",
    "we used the urqmd - version:3.3p2 in default cascade mode without invoking any hydrodynamic evolution for the initial state .",
    "it includes 55 baryon species ( up to mass 2.25 gev ) and 32 meson species ( up to mass 1.9 gev ) and their corresponding anti - particles and iso - spin projected states .",
    "particle production in urqmd occurs through inelastic collisions , decay of meson , baryon resonances , and string fragmentation mechanism . at low energies ( @xmath9 4 gev )",
    "hadronic interactions are based on two body or three body potential",
    ". however at high energies , hadron - hadron collisions are performed stochastically in the spirit of cascade model  @xcite .",
    "the total ( elastic and inelastic ) cross - sections of baryons and mesons are generally fitted to experimental proton - proton or proton - pion scattering data . for the resonant baryon - meson or hyperon - baryon scattering where no experimental data are available , principle of detail balance or additive quark model have been used .",
    "the resonance scattering dominates the total cross - section at low beam momenta ( upto @xmath10 2 gev ) however towards higher beam momenta string excitation has the largest contribution .",
    "the inelastic collisions and decays are responsible for changing the particle abundances of the system while the elastic collisions modify the momentum distribution of hadrons",
    ".    we have considered central collisions ( impact parameter b = 2 fm ) of au nuclei at the laboratory energies ( @xmath11 ) 10a , 20a , 30a , 40a gev . for each energy we ran the simulation at different time steps ranging from 1fm / c to 15 fm / c .",
    "6@xmath12 events have been analyzed for each time step .",
    "the center of mass frame is chosen as the computational frame in our analysis .",
    "we have considered a cell of dimension @xmath13 @xmath14 about the origin of au  +  au system .",
    "the test volume has been chosen such that the effect of collective flow of the system on the observables will be minimum and at the same time the particle number should be large enough for reasonably small fluctuation in the observables .",
    "additionally a momentum rapidity cut @xmath15 has been imposed on the particles under consideration to ensure that the incident nucleon contribution does not come into account .",
    "we have calculated the net particle density , different components of microscopic pressure for non - strange baryons , strange baryons and mesons inside the cell .",
    "the non - strange baryons include proton ( @xmath16 ) and neutron ( @xmath17 ) , the strange baryons include lamda ( @xmath18 ) , sigma ( @xmath19 ) , cascade ( @xmath4 ) , omega ( @xmath5 ) and the strange mesons include kaons : @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "all the higher mass resonances ( baryon and meson ) are allowed to decay .",
    "we did not include @xmath5 in the pressure calculation at @xmath22 = 10a and 20a gev due to its limited statistics at lower energies .",
    "however we expect that inclusion of @xmath5 does not modify any conclusion drawn in this work .",
    "we have also calculated the energy spectra ( edn / d@xmath23p vs. e ) of protons and lamdas inside the cell .",
    "lastly the above quantities are statistically averaged over the number of events for each time step .",
    "the time ( t ) is the elapsed time in center of mass frame .",
    "time t = 0 fm / c corresponds to the moment when two nuclei touch each other . the net particle density @xmath24 is defined as the difference of particle density and anti - particle density .",
    "the evolution of net non - strange baryon density ( @xmath25 ) , net strange baryon density ( @xmath26 ) , net kaon density ( @xmath27 ) , and net strange baryon to kaon ratio ( @xmath26/ @xmath27 ) are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - density ] at @xmath11 = 10a , 20a , 30a , 40a gev .",
    "the net particle density starts from a small value , reaches a maximum around t = 2r/(@xmath28 ) when the two nuclei pass through each other and then falls down as the system expands .",
    "the generic feature has been found in agreement with earlier works  @xcite .",
    "here r is the radius of au nucleus , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the lorentz boost and velocity in center of mass frame .",
    "thus we found the maximum matter density near 6 fm / c at 10a gev and 3 fm / c at 40a gev for all species .",
    "the production of non - strange baryons has been found almost similar for all the beam energies , but the strange baryon and meson production becomes larger with increasing beam energy .",
    "this is probably because of the fact that string excitation mechanism has major contribution to strangeness production at higer energies .",
    "the peak of baryonic ( non - strange and strange ) matter density has been found at 40a gev , which is about 78 times the ground state nuclear matter density .",
    "the time evolution of strange baryon to meson ratio has clearly shown the net strangeness content of the created matter is dominated by baryons for all the beam energies .",
    "the ratio has been found to grow with time because the kaons and lamdas are produced through same strong interaction .",
    "however the kaons have suffered less scatterings in the medium due to its small interaction cross - section with other hadrons  @xcite , thus escapes the reaction volume quickly .",
    "the production of kaons is larger at higher beam energies can be seen from the non - monotonus behaviour of the ratio at smaller times .",
    "we have studied the isotropisation of different components of microscopic pressure of non - strange baryons , strange baryons and kaons for an expanding system .",
    "the pressure components are highly anisotropic immediately after the collision .",
    "thermal equilibrium is established in the cell when they have become nearly isotropic .",
    "different components of microscopic pressure are calculated in urqmd using ideal gas ansatz  @xcite : p_(x , y , z ) = _ i , where , @xmath31 is the momentum , @xmath32 is the mass of ith hadron and v is the volume of the cell under consideration .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse components of pressure for an ensemble of hadrons are defined as : p_l = p_z ; p_t = ( p_x + p_y ) , here the @xmath33 corresponds to the statistical average over the number of events .",
    "the time evolution of the longitudinal - to - transverse pressure ratio ( @xmath34 ) for the above mentioned hadron species are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pressure ] at the four beam energies .",
    "the @xmath35 ratio of baryons ( non - strange and strange ) starts from a large value at initial times , ultimately settles down to a value close to 1.0 .",
    "this reflects the longitudinal(@xmath36 ) and transverse ( @xmath37 ) momentum distribution of baryons are highly anisotropic at initial times .",
    "successive elastic scatterings in the medium have made their momentum distribution nearly isotropic .",
    "we found that the ratio @xmath35 becomes 1.0 around 6.5 fm for non - strange baryons and 7 fm for strange baryons at @xmath11 = 10a gev .",
    "however the system further evolves and the ratio reaches a constant value @xmath380.8 for t@xmath39 9 fm / c . at this point",
    "we may say that the baryonic matter achieves a thermal equilibrium .",
    "earlier work at ags energy had also found similar time scale  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of @xmath35 from unity after - equilibrium , is possibly arising due to finite shear viscosity of the hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "the ratio is more closer to unity as the system approaches towards ideal fluid limit .",
    "this has been shown by a recent study on the pressure isotropization in quark - gluon plasma for au  +  au coliisions at top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "for other beam energies the @xmath35 ratio of baryons has become unity much earlier , and it achieves a constant value @xmath380.80.7 for t @xmath39 8 fm / c at 20a gev , for t @xmath39 7 fm / c at 30a gev and for t @xmath39 6fm / c at 40a gev . on close inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig - pressure ] , we found the pressure isotropization of non - strange baryons happen little earlier @xmath400.5 fm / c than strange baryons .",
    "the observation can be found in concurrence with an earlier urqmd based calculation  @xcite , which has shown the average freeze - out time of nucleons is smaller than the strange baryons ( @xmath18 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath35 ratio of kaons approaches to 1.0 at early times @xmath413 fm / c and then becomes almost constant @xmath38 0.60.7 at the same time as the baryons .",
    "the initial longitudinal - to - transverse pressure ( momentum ) anisotropy of kaons has been found smaller than baryons , could be because of the facts that kaons have only one constituent quark from the original excited hadron and suffer less resonant scatterings than baryons in medium .",
    "thus we found that the pressure isotropization time of baryons and mesons reduces by about 3 fm / c from @xmath11 = 10a gev to @xmath11 = 40a gev .      in this section",
    ", we adopted an alternate approach to equilibrium which would reinforce the findings of earlier section .",
    "we investigated the time scale of local thermalization of baryonic matter from the time evolution of inverse slope parameter of the energy spectra ( @xmath42 vs e ) .",
    "for this purpose we have parameterized the energy spectra of proton and lamda inside the cell by tsallis distribution  @xcite .",
    "the distribution has extensively been used in recent years for describing the transverse momentum distribution of produced hadrons at rhic and the lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "the special merit of the distribution is : at low energy limit it reduces to an exponential distribution and at high energy limit it reduces to a power - law distribution  @xcite .",
    "thus it can accommodate both equilibrium and non - equilibrium phenomena . keeping this in mind , we write the energy spectra of proton and lamda inside the cell as ; e = c(1+)^-b , where e is the energy of baryon in the unit of gev and b @xmath43 1/(q-1 ) is dimensionless . c has the unit of gev@xmath44 and t is in gev .",
    "q is called the non - extensive parameter of tsallis distribution .",
    "the values of c , b , t are obtained through fitting the energy spectra up to e @xmath43 3 gev .",
    "the inverse slope parameter of this distribution is given by : t_slope = t  +  ( q-1)e . in the asymptotic limit @xmath45 , the inverse slope parameter ( @xmath46 ) gives the thermodynamic temperature of the system  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath46 of proton and lamda energy spectra at e @xmath43 0.1 gev ( nearly pion mass ) and studied its time evolution at the four beam energies .",
    "the error in @xmath46 arises from the errors in the fitting parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - tslope ]",
    ".    we have found @xmath46 ( both proton and lamda ) falls sharply with time and changes its variation near t = 9 fm / c at 10a gev . from this point",
    "onwards @xmath46 approximately scales as @xmath49 which signifies an isentropic longitudinal expansion sets in inside the cell , analogous to ideal relativistic hydrodynamics . the onset of longitudinal expansion marks the local thermal equilibrium of the system . at later times",
    ", @xmath46 starts deviating from this scaling .",
    "this could be the effect of transverse collective flow which starts stemming inside the cell as the system is driven towards thermal freeze - out .",
    "similarly we have found the @xmath49 scaling holds for t@xmath50 8 fm / c at 20a gev , t@xmath50 6 fm / c at 30a gev and for t@xmath50 5 fm / c at 40a gev beam energy .",
    "thus the timescale of thermalization of energy spectra has been found roughly in agreement with the pressure isotropization time of baryons and decreases with the increase in laboratory energy .    [",

    "in the preceding sections we argued that the dense hadronic matter created in the collisions will achieve local thermal equilibrium on a certain time scale . thus we can employ the statistical hadron gas model  @xcite to extract the intensive thermodynamic variables like ; temperature , chemical potential of the system during subsequent evolution . here",
    "we mention that the statistical model can not be applied during the early non - equilibrium phase after the collision , rather can be applied beyond thermal freeze - out when average scattering rate between the constituents is smaller than the average expansion rate of the system . considering the above scenarios ; we made the comparison of statistical model with urqmd during the time interval 10 fm / c @xmath51 17 fm / c at 10a gev and 8 fm / c @xmath51 15 fm / c at 30a gev laboratory energy .",
    "we have checked that the average number of elastic collisions ( @xmath52 ) suffered by different hadron species almost saturates after the aforementioned time limit which implies no further collision takes place .    the expression for number density , energy density for the i th hadron species in the statistical hadron gas model are given by : n_i & = & 4p^2dpf_i(t,_i ) , + _ i & = & 4p^2 dp(p^2+m^2)^ f_i(t,_i ) , where @xmath53 is the distribution function of the ith hadron ( either fermi - dirac or bose - einstein ) .",

    "our aim is to get some insight about the fluidity of the dense baryonic matter created in these collisions . in recent times",
    "several calculations  @xcite have been reported on the transport properties of hadronic matter at finite baryo - chemical potential , including the effect high mass resonances , etc .",
    "however the discussion about the fluidity of dense hadronic matter can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors have argued that the fluid behaviour of a baryon rich ( @xmath64 500 mev ) hadron gas is closer to the ideal fluid limit than the corresponding gas with zero baryon number .",
    "following their observation , we have compared the entropy densities at @xmath11 = 10a and 30a gev with the ideal fluid limit reached at the highest rhic energy ( @xmath65 = 200 gev ) .",

    "the entropy density at @xmath11 = 10a gev falls even little faster than the aforementioned limit .",
    "it may imply that the hadronic matter produced at 10a gev beam energy is more ideal than the same at 30a gev beam energy .",
    "the observation can be understood using the fact that shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ( @xmath69 ) of a hadronic system decreases with increasing fugacity ( @xmath70 ) of the system  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the time scale for local thermal equilibration of dense baryonic matter created in central au  +  au collisions at the proposed cbm experiment energies of e@xmath71 = 10a , 20a , 30a , 40a gev .",
    "the microscopic transport model urqmd has been used for this purpose in the default cascade mode .",
    "the net baryon density has been found maximum at 30 - 40 gev and the net strangeness of the created hadronic matter is dominated by baryons for all energies stated above .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of longitudinal - to - transverse microscopic pressure anisotropy and inverse slope parameter of the energy spectra of baryons and mesons inside a cell of 8 @xmath14 in the central region of au  + au system .",
    "the pressure anisotropy ratio of baryons and mesons has achieved a constant value close to unity , on a certain time .",
    "the time has been found to decrease with the increase in laboratory energy .",
    "the time scale obtained from the evolution of inverse slope parameter of energy spectra of baryons nearly agrees with the pressure ( or momentum ) isotropization time .",

    "thus the estimated time scales are expected to change in a region which is away from the center .",
    "therefore the present study at best provides an upper limit of the time scales required for achieving thermodynamic equilibrium of the system created at those energies .    using the statistical thermal model ,",
    "we have obtained the temperature and chemical potentials of the hadronic matter during the post - equilibrium evolution at e@xmath71 = 10a and 30a gev .",
    "they are found to agree qualitatively with the empirical relation between t and @xmath55 at the chemical freeze - out .",
    "in addition we have calculated the entropy density of the baryonic matter inside the cell and found the evolution is quasi - isentropic , close to the ideal hydrodynamic limit at zero net baryon density .",

    "<S> the conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium of baryons ( non - strange , strange ) and mesons ( strange ) are presented for central au + au collisions at fair energies using the microscopic transport model urqmd . the net particle density , longitudinal - to - transverse pressure anisotropy and inverse slope parameters of the energy spectra of non - strange and strange hadrons are calculated inside a cell in the central region within rapidity window @xmath0 at different time steps after the collision . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the strangeness content is dominated by baryons at all energies , however contribution from mesons become significant at higher energies . the time scale obtained from local pressure ( momentum ) isotropization and thermalization of energy spectra </S>",
