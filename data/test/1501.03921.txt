    "how is the orbit of a photon that is affected by the field of a binary system ? this is a three- body problem with gravitational interactions . adding one body to the famous two- body problem of a photon in a gravitational field brings a remarkable complexity to the problem .",
    "it is however believed that in a complete treatment of such motions and with todays highly accurate astronomical observations in hand , these effects must be taken into account .",
    "this subject has been a field of interest since the astrometric space mission like gaia planned to position the stars and celestial objects with one microarcsecond level of accuracy @xcite . at this level",
    ", many subtle effects are potentially observable .",
    "one of them would probably be the deflection of light by the field of a binary system .",
    "when a photon moves in the ( weak gravity ) field of an isolated spherical body , the leading order corrections to the photon ( newtonian path ) are scaled by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the closest distance to the gravitating body the photon can reach and @xmath4 is the mass of such body . considering the scales characterizing our problem , it is tempting to ask whether there are any relativistic effects produced by the second body in the binary that we should be concerned of , or the traces left by the companying body still remains a challenge for future missions ?    in this work , we assume that photons move on the null paths and are influenced by a binary system , with two equal masses , in a circular motion .",
    "we also assume that the radius of the binary orbit is large , compared to the distance between photon and the member of the binary which we call it the _",
    "main body_. in adequately weak gravity regimes , effects like the deviation of the photon trajectory from straight line , may be well described by the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "the latter assumption permits an approximate solution to our problem by reducing the three - body problem to the motion of a photon in an effective field of the orbiting bodies .    to better discuss the dynamics of this system , we introduce two lengthscales .",
    "one scale is given by @xmath5 , and the other scale is the radius of the circular orbit , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the separation between the photon and the black hole .",
    "we assume that i ) @xmath8 is small and ii ) the second body in the binary is remote . in a reference frame that moves with the main body ,",
    "the effects of the second body on the geometry of the spacetime can be described by tidal potentials .",
    "these are given by a linear perturbation about the schwarzchild solution ; so that the perturbed metric satisfies the vacuum field equations , perturbatively .",
    "it is straightforward to apply tidal effects to a system comprising a photon and a gravitating body , but solving the equations corresponding to the path of the photon in this perturbed spacetime would be tricky . a suitable framework for solving the path based on _ osculating orbits _",
    "has already been suggested in @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the motion of the photon is at all times described by a family of null geodesics , called osculating trajectories , characterized by a set of constants of motion .",
    "a nice reformulation of the various aspects of the original problem can be achieved by the evolution of these constants , if we know the interacting forces .",
    "the evolution of this set of constants is constrained by a set of first order differential equations , known as the osculating conditions . in this paper",
    "we calculate the tidal forces acting on the photon employing a metric calculated in a paper by taylor and poisson @xcite . in their work ,",
    "the main gravitating body was a black hole , they used this metric to find the _ dynamics of a black hole _ , i.e , those produced by an influx of gravitational energy across the horizon ( like tidal heating or increase in mass , angular momentum and surface area @xcite ) of the black hole .",
    "our interest in this paper is mostly in the consequences of the tidal interactions on a _ photon orbital dynamics_. the metric given by taylor and poisson is not necessarily restricted to the weak field approximation and can be equally used in small hole approximation , in which the gravitating body is assumed to be much smaller than the second body . in our problem , we need to know the tidal fields and their effects on the structure of spacetime around the gravitating body , all within the weak field approximation to general relativity .    assuming that the photon path would not be too different from the schwarzchild light paths , we will include the force components in the osculating equations given in @xcite to obtain the observable variations at any point of the path .",
    "our results can be evaluated in any coordinate systems ; this guarantees that those are observable quantities .",
    "for example , we find that the total deflection angle depends on the second body position and varies from a minimum equal to @xmath9 $ ] to a maximum @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the closest distance to the main body that the photon could reach , if it were an isolated body .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we start with the metric describing the tidal environment around a gravitating body .",
    "we find the tidally perturbed metric in schwarzchid coordinates by a coordinate transformation ( from harmonic coordinates ) .",
    "we would like to focus on the leading effects and neglect the smaller ones ; so we find the simultaneously weak field and slow motion limit of the metric .",
    "these perturbations to the metric are considered as static fields on a flat background .",
    "we then calculate different components of the perturbing force and the equations governing the photon path in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "the evolution of constants of motion is discussed .",
    "the discussion will be concluded with the summary and conclusions of the results in section v.",
    "the general description of the spacetime around a spherical gravitating body in an arbitrary tidal environment is given by a metric , which has the following form in schwarzchild coordinates , @xmath12 ,    [ background_metric_cart ] @xmath13{{\\cal e}}^{q}_a \\omega^{a}_{a}+o\\left(\\frac{\\rho^3}{{{\\cal r}}^2   \\cal{l}}\\right),\\\\ g_{\\rho\\rho}&=\\left(1 - 2\\frac{m}{\\rho}\\right)^{-1}-\\rho^2{{\\cal e}}^q+o\\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\frac{\\rho^3}{{{\\cal r}}^2   \\cal{l}}\\right),\\\\ g_{ab}&=\\rho^2\\left[\\omega_{ab}-\\rho^2\\left(1-\\frac{m}{\\rho}\\right)^{-1}\\left(1 - 2\\frac{m}{\\rho}\\right)^2\\omega_{ab}{{\\cal e}}^q\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad \\mbox { }   \\left.+\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m^3}{\\rho}\\left(1-\\frac{m}{\\rho}\\right)^{-1}-m\\rho\\left(1-\\frac{m}{\\rho}\\right)\\right)\\left(2{{\\cal e}}_{ab}\\omega^{a}_{a}\\omega^{b}_{b}+{{\\cal e}}^q\\omega_{ab}\\right)\\right]+o\\left(\\frac{\\rho^3}{{{\\cal r}}^2   \\cal{l}}\\right)g_{ab}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath14 is gravitational radius of our body , @xmath15 which satisfies @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the domain of validity of the metric is the spherical body neighborhood . to find this metric ,",
    "we used the results of @xcite , and performed a coordinate transformation from the harmonics coordinates @xmath24 to @xmath25 , given by @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in @xcite ,",
    "taylor and poisson , examined the motion and the tidal dynamics of a black hole placed within a post - newtonian external spacetime .",
    "appendix a presents some crucial results of that paper .",
    "our work is a continuation of their effort , and this coordinate transformation brings the metric of the distorted black hole ( [ background_metric_harmonic ] ) to the new form given in ( [ background_metric_cart ] ) .",
    "this metric applies to the spacetime outside any spherical body immersed in a tidal environment .",
    "it is linearized about the schwarzchild solution and satisfies ( approximate ) vacuum field equations .",
    "the tidal environment is presented as a functional of arbitrary external potentials @xmath28 built from the lowest order tidal moments , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . within this approximation ,",
    "the metric is accurate to all orders in @xmath31 and the neglected terms involve third order in @xmath32 that come from higher order tidal moments or the time derivative of quadrapole moments .",
    "although the potentials that characterize the tidal perturbations are completely general , in this work we require that the gravitating body be a member of a binary system .    in studying the path of a photon through a curved geometry ,",
    "it is a well known practice to consider the metric perturbations as fields defined on a flat background spacetime . in this way",
    "the tidal environment is described by the weak field limit of the metric .",
    "following the same practice , we take @xmath31 as well as the potential terms produced by the second body , i.e the linear perturbation terms to flat minkowski space , to be small . for the problem under study ,",
    "the radius of the binary is large and the terms beyond the quadrapole tidal moments were already assumed to be small . for this procedure to make sense , we should invoke the slow motion limit , @xmath33 as well .",
    "we introduce two dimensionless parameters which are almost equally small and denote them by @xmath34 @xmath35 in this limit , the nonzero components of the metric are thus written as    [ background_weak field ] @xmath36 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath29 is a symmetric - trace free tensor , which its components for circular orbit motion are calculated by matching the local metric with the global metric that include the gravitating body and the external spacetime @xcite .",

    "there are some points that we would like to add :    1 .",
    "although the gravitomagnetic tidal ( vector ) potentials exist in a relativistic description of the geometry around a gravitating body , they do not appear in weak field limit and slow motion context ( @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the tidal environment velocity scale ) .",
    "this is also true for gravito - electric vector and tensor potentials . 2 .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the schwarzchild geometry is perturbationally broken ; so the birkhoff theorem will let us to have a non - static vacuum spacetime .",
    "the tidal geometry is described by a scalar potential and each scalar potential transforms as such under parity .",
    "this ensures that the deformed metric be conserved under a parity transformation .",
    "if we expand the tidal potential given in ( [ scalar potential ] ) , in terms of spherical harmonics we will have @xmath45 .",

    "this fact demonstrates an additional symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath48 .",
    "the presence of the second body has greatly reduced the isometry ( lie ) group of schwarzchild spacetime to ( discrete ) subgroups , namely parity and mirror symmetry .",
    "the first step before writing the null geodesic equations is to calculate the christoffel symbols for this metric .",
    "the perturbed geodesic equations will then be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 here @xmath51s and @xmath52s are components of the schwarzchild christoffel symbols and their perturbations , respectively .",
    "appendix b gives the full list of these symbols in the weak field limit . the right hand side of ( [ geodesics ] ) represents the perturbing force components .",
    "it does not seem to be much hope for solving the set of equations ( [ geodesics ] ) in a general case .",
    "fortunately , there are some special cases in which the remaining symmetries simplify the task .",
    "it is easy to see that the plane @xmath48 satisfies the equation for @xmath53 ) for @xmath54 , different terms include either @xmath55 or @xmath56 which can be easily verified from ( [ symbols ] ) to be zero at @xmath57 . ] therefore , if we specialize to the case in which photons move in equatorial plane of the binary system , i.e , if the inclination parameter , @xmath58 , is exactly @xmath59 and the binary orbit is edge - on , the direction of angular momentum will be conserved and the photon will not leave the plane , because @xmath60 .",
    "other components of the tidal force applied to the photon will then be    [ forces]@xmath61    even with above simplifications , integrating the equations of motion and determining the photon path will not be simple .",
    "although the perturbing forces are complicated , we believe that these forces keep the form of the photon path .",
    "therefore , the leading correction to the schwarzchild null curves can be determined by the method of variation of parameters ( vop ) .",
    "as described in @xcite , in this method one employs a known solution of a fiducial system of differential equations as an ansatz for solving the system under study .",
    "the known solution , @xmath62 , plays the role of instantaneously tangential ( or osculating ) trajectories to the true path , @xmath63 .",
    "each point on the true path with parameter @xmath64 is coincides geometrically and dynamically with an osculating trajectory with one specified set of constants , @xmath65 ; the number of these constants is equal to the number of phase space independent variables .",
    "the constants are furnished with @xmath64 dependence and evolve along a flow line on a cross section of phase space that is consistent with null condition .",
    "each and every flow line is constrained by the osculating conditions @xmath66 but different flow lines may correspond to very different interactions .",
    "this reformulation of the problem provides an insight into the effects of perturbing forces on various aspects of the motion . in the framework of vop",
    ", the perturbing forces are not assumed to be small and the only restriction is that the forces must preserve the shape of the path .",
