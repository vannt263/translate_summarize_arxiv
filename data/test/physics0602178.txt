    "nonequilibrium growth models leading naturally to self - organized fractal patterns , the structure of which strongly depends on the dynamics of the growth process , are of continuing interest due to their relevance for many important fields@xcite .",
    "diffusion - limited -aggregation ( dla)@xcite is probably the most remarkable growth model for pattern formation .",
    "this model generates complex and mysterious fractal structures@xcite , which seem to be generated as well in natural systems in which growth is controlled by diffusive , including dielectric breakdown@xcite , electrochemical deposition@xcite , colloid aggregation@xcite , film growth@xcite , viscous fingering@xcite , laplacian flow@xcite etc .    in the original dla model@xcite ,",
    "particles released at a point distant from the cluster execute random walks until they find a nearest neighbor site of the cluster and irreversibly stick at this site .",
    "however , for many physical processes , the medium is nonuniform so that the probability of jumping from site @xmath2 to site @xmath3 is usually not equal to that from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , except nearestneighboring jumps , there also exist some nonlocal jumps through which the particle can move to a distant site at a step .",
    "one example is the diffusion of adatoms on metal surfaces , in which the long jumps play a dominating role@xcite .",
    "a bunch of defects or impurities in the substrate may also play the part of the long - jump path in the case of weak absorbate - substrate interaction@xcite , which is important for the thin - film growth , heterogeneous catalysis , and oxidation .",
    "hence , the traditional undirected regular lattice will miss important information of medium and it is unconformity to characterize the actual dla process .",
    "this thus calls for the use of network structure with directed long - range connections .    on the other hand ,",
    "complex networks have recently attracted an increasing interest among physicists@xcite . in particular , small - world ( sw ) networks , introduced by watts and strogatz@xcite , have been extensively studied because they constitute an interesting attempt to translate the complex topology of social , biological , and physical networks into a simple model .",
    "two dimensional ( 2d ) sw networks result from randomly rewiring a fraction of links of a 2d regular lattice .",
    "several dynamical models have recently been studied in order to understand the effect of sw topology on classical systems such as the ising model@xcite , the spread of epidemics@xcite , aggregation@xcite , random walks@xcite , etc .",
    "such models are expected to capture the essential features of the complicated processes taking place on real networks .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dla process on a 2d directed sw network , in which the directed links correspond to the directed irreversibly jumps and the node is regarded as the lattice point of the real space , respectively .",
    "in order to construct the directed sw network , we start from a 2d square lattice of size @xmath4 consisting of sites linked to their four nearest neighbors by both outgoing and incoming links , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . then , we reconnect nearest - neighbor outgoing links to a different site chosen at random with the probability @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lattice distance between the two selected sites and @xmath7)$ ] is the clustering exponent which characterizes the localized degree of the long - range links in the lattice .",
    "the formula corresponds to the diffusivity represented by arrhenius relation as usual in surface science@xcite .",
    "the reconstructing process is repeated until @xmath1 , the number of long - range rewiring connections , reaches a desired value .",
    "note that by performing this procedure every site will have exactly four fixed outgoing links and a random number of incoming links . when the clustering exponent @xmath0=0 , we have a uniform distribution over long - range connections , and the present model reduces to the basic 2d directed sw network@xcite . as @xmath8 ( @xmath8 denotes @xmath0 tends to 1 ) ,",
    "the long - range links of a site become more and more local in its vicinity . in reverse , as @xmath9 , the long - range rewiring outgoing links are in favor of the farther sites .",
    "thus , the clustering exponent @xmath0 serves as a structural parameter controlling the spatial length of the long - range connections .",

    "a particle is released at a random position where is depart from the outer radius of the growing pattern",
    ". then the particle jumps along the direction from the current site to one of its linked sites which are not occupied by the growing pattern , with equal probability step by step . at last",
    ", the particle irreversibly sticks at the nearest neighbor site of the growing pattern in terms of the physical distance and the pattern will grow gradually . to reduce the effect of fluctuation , the calculated result is taken average over 10 different network realizations and 10 independent runs for each network configuration for each set of parameters @xmath12 .",

    "the pattern is nearly the most dense when @xmath0=0 . while , it gets thin and sparse when @xmath0 departs from 0 tending to 1 or @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is astonishing that the symmetry of the aggregation pattern is markedly broken while @xmath14 , which is more obvious as @xmath0 tends to @xmath13 . to quantify the patterns of dla , we calculate the fractal dimensions @xmath15 of the dla by box - counting method@xcite , which are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that there exists a maximum value of @xmath15 when @xmath0 equals 0 for each @xmath1 .",

    ", particles can jump directly to distant sites , including the traditionally completely screened deep fjord .",
    "the nonlocal connections effectively weaken the screening effect so that the pattern of aggregate becomes compact and the fractal dimension @xmath15 increases with @xmath1 increasing . on the other hand , the clustering exponent @xmath0 , which restricts the spatial length of the long - range connection , affects the morphology of the aggregate and the fractal dimension @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath8 , the long - range links are restricted more and more local in its vicinity so that the capacity of weakening the screening effect vanishes gradually . finally , @xmath15 does not vary and the morphology of the aggregate seems like the original dla pattern , as shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 . when @xmath0=0 , the spatial lengths of the long - range connections are entire random , neither too distant nor too local and they have a uniform distribution . then , due to intensive weakening for the screening effect , the random particle has the chance to appear on arbitrary sites on the underlying network so that the pattern becomes thick and compact , corresponding to increase of @xmath15 .",
    "however , as @xmath9 , the long - range links tend to the sites as distant as possible and the irreversible jumps along directed links break the symmetry of dynamics .",
    "thus , small fluctuations are enhanced , and this instability together with the randomness inherent in the model leads to a complex asymmetrical behavior .    however , the fractal dimension @xmath15 is a rough description because the pattern becomes asymmetric while @xmath9 .",
