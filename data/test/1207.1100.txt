    "the radial instability of the electron - degenerate , chandrasekhar - mass core marks the beginning of the final episode in the life of a massive star with zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) mass in the range @xmath3 .",

    "this stabilizes the inner core , which overshoots its new equilibrium , then rebounds into the outer core , launching a strong hydrodynamic shock wave from its edge .",
    "this instant in time is referred to as _",
    "core bounce_. the inner core has a mass of @xmath4 at bounce and this material becomes the unshocked core of the protoneutron star .",
    "the shock formed at core bounce propagates into the outer core , but the dissociation of nuclei in the accreted material into neutrons and protons and the electron capture on free protons in the region behind the shock ( the _ postshock _ region ) soon sap its might , driving it into submission to the ram pressure of accretion .",
    "the shock stalls and turns into a standing accretion shock that must be revived to unbind the stellar envelope and drive a core - collapse supernova explosion .",
    "neutrinos play a pivotal and dominant role in stellar collapse and core - collapse supernovae .",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carry away the @xmath5@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) of gravitational binding energy of the remnant neutron star over tens of seconds after core bounce .",
    "aided by multi - dimensional fluid instabilities , they probably deposit , within a few hundred milliseconds after bounce , sufficient energy in the region behind the stalled shock to revive the shock and make typical @xmath5@xmath8 core - collapse supernova explosion ( @xcite and references therein ) . only hyper - energetic ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) explosions may require a different mechanism @xcite , e.g. , rapid rotation combined with strong magnetic fields , which may lead to energetic jet - driven explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for a galactic or near - extragalactic core - collapse supernova ,",
    "neutrinos offer the unique possibility of directly observing the dynamics and thermodynamic conditions prevalent in the supernova core .",
    "together with gravitational waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) they will herald the next nearby supernova possibly hours before any telescope sensitive to electromagnetic waves will notice the event . in the probable case that the next galactic supernova occurs in a dust - enshrouded region and/or close or behind the galactic center ,",
    "the supernova may be impossible to observe in broad bands of the electromagnetic spectrum , making neutrino and gravitational - wave observations even more important .",
    "the observation of neutrinos from sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud @xcite confirmed the basic picture of core collapse and early protoneutron star evolution ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , but the small number and poor timing of the observed interactions did not allow far - reaching and robust conclusions on core - collapse supernova dynamics and the involved neutrino physics , nuclear physics and astrophysics",
    ".    the situation will be completely different when the neutrino burst from a galactic core - collapse supernova reaches current and near - future neutrino detectors on earth .",

    "while artificially - driven , spherically - symmetric core collapse simulations suggest that a sudden deep drop of the accretion - driven component of the neutrino luminosity ( primarily in @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) within a few hundred milliseconds would indicate the onset of explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the situation is likely different in nature as multidimensional simulations show a much shallower drop due to simultaneous accretion and explosion of material .",

    "the ability of some detectors to distinguish interactions of different neutrino flavors would lead to constraints on the neutron - to - proton ratio in the neutrino - driven wind phase , allowing an observational test of core - collapse supernovae as potential sites for @xmath14-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .    the neutrino signature of core collapse , of the subsequent core - collapse supernova evolution and of the protoneutron star cooling phase ,",
    "is invariably intertwined with neutrino oscillation physics .",
    "the robustness of all of the above mentioned observational conclusions will depend on our understanding of the impact of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "neutrinos propagating from their emission site to detectors on earth may experience ( _ i _ ) so - called vacuum oscillations driven by neutrino mass differences @xcite , ( _ ii _ ) oscillations mediated by a resonance in @xmath10@xmath15 scattering ( the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein [ msw ] effect ; @xcite ) , and ( _ iii _ ) oscillations due to @xmath10@xmath10 scattering ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",

    "however , a number of recent studies suggest that collective oscillations may be completely or at least partially suppressed in the preexplosion accretion phase of ordinary core - collapse supernovae @xcite , but see @xcite and @xcite for discrepant results .",
    "provided that collective oscillations can be ignored in the preexplosion phase and that the @xmath16 mixing angle indeed has the large value suggested by recent measurements @xcite , the neutrino mass hierarchy may be inferred from the qualitative shape of the early postbounce neutrino signal @xcite .",
    "a preexplosion accretion phase with suppressed collective oscillations would also offer the opportunity to probe the structure of the progenitor star on the basis of the observed neutrino signal .",
    "the details of the preexplosion neutrino emission have been discussed carefully , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite and we shall not repeat them here .",
    "it is , however , necessary to outline its most salient features . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect neutrino oscillations in the following",
    ".    in core collapse and in the subsequent postbounce evolution , emission of @xmath12 and @xmath13 occurs via charged and neutral currents , while heavy - lepton neutrinos @xmath17 are created exclusively via thermal neutral - current pair processes . before core",
    "bounce , only @xmath12 are emitted from electron capture in the collapsing core .",
    "milliseconds after core bounce , the shock breaks out of the @xmath12 neutrinosphere ( where the optical depth is @xmath18 ) and a strong burst of @xmath12 is emitted for @xmath5@xmath19 from rapid electron capture on the freshly abundant free protons behind the shock .",
    "@xmath20 are copiously created in the hot interior of the protoneutron star after bounce and begin to diffuse out , leading to a steep rise , quick leveling and subsequent slow decay of the @xmath20 luminosity ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath13 production via charged - current positron capture is initially suppressed due to the high degeneracy of the electrons .",
    "the latter is partially lifted after bounce at the moderate - density , hot edge of the protoneutron star and @xmath22 rises , reaching or surpassing the value at which @xmath23 levels off after the neutronization burst decays .",
    "the subsequent preexplosion luminosity can roughly be split into a diffusive component from the core and accretion luminosity ( @xmath24 \\dot{m } / r_\\nu$ ] , where @xmath25 is an approximate neutrinosphere radius ) from or from above the neutrinosphere @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is primarily diffusive , while @xmath23 and @xmath22 are dominated by accretion . in general , @xmath26 , but @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath20 have the lowest opacity , since they interact only via neutral currents .",
    "they decouple from matter at the smallest radii and highest temperatures and thus have the highest average energies @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath13 have a slightly lower opacity than @xmath12 , leading to the well established neutrino energy hierarchy in the preexplosion phase @xmath29 .",
    "the mean energy of all species grows with increasing postbounce time , reflecting the recession of the neutrinospheres due to the contraction of the protoneutron star .",
    "considering that the accretion luminosity will scale with the postbounce accretion rate @xmath30 , one would naturally expect an increase of the detected neutrino interactions with increasing mass of the stellar core .",
    "since higher accretion rates correspond to more material compressing and settling more rapidly on the protoneutron star , the latter s outer regions will be hotter .",
    "thus the thermal neutral - current emission will be enhanced , leading to higher luminosities and higher mean neutrino energies .",
    "the variation of the preexplosion neutrino signal with progenitor star zams mass was first discussed by @xcite based on the pioneering simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors provided total emission characteristics and spectra that show a systematic increase of total energy emitted in neutrinos and mean @xmath13 energy with zams mass in the range from @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite , before sn 1987a , carried out simulations of a range of progenitor stars with zams mass in the range @xmath32 .",
    "they found that the @xmath12 neutronization burst shows little dependence on the progenitor , due to the rather universal homologous collapse and bounce dynamics .",
    "furthermore , they mentioned , though did not discuss in detail , that the luminosities and mean neutrino energies increase as a function of iron core mass ( and not zams mass ) .",
    "a more detailed and clear physical discussion was provided by @xcite , who contrasted the predicted neutrino signal from the early postbounce phase in two different progenitor core models with neutrino observations of sn 1987a .",
    "he noted that there are significant uncertainties in connecting a given zams mass to precollapse structure . instead of a progenitor with an associated zams mass , he considered a massive ( and high - entropy ) @xmath33-@xmath34 iron core model and a lower - mass ( and lower - entropy ) @xmath35-@xmath34 iron core model in his spherically - symmetric ( 1d ) neutrino radiation - hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "he showed that the more massive core leads to a consistently higher @xmath13 luminosity in both the accretion and diffusion sectors .",
    "the water cherenkov detectors that observed neutrinos from sn 1987a are most sensitive to the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) reaction @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite predicted a factor of two difference in the integrated number of early ibd interactions between the massive and the low - mass core in these detectors .",
    "he concluded that the neutrino signal observed by these detectors from sn 1987a was most consistent with the low - mass core .",
    "@xcite , who carried out a parameter study of quasi - hydrostatic protoneutron star cooling , considering various initial masses , ad - hoc accretion rates , and different nuclear eos , found a similar trend .",
    "he showed that more massive cores , higher accretion rates , and softer eos lead to stronger , higher - energy neutrino emission .",
    "some of his strongest emitters were cases in which eventually a black hole was formed .",
    "liebendrfer and collaborators carried out a sequence of studies of the progenitor dependence of the neutrino signal using modern general relativistic 1d radiation - hydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "they showed that the @xmath12 neutronization burst is indeed almost independent of progenitor structure ( as first suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "they also qualitatively and quantitatively connected the evolution of the postbounce preexplosion luminosity to the postbounce accretion rate , but did not discuss observational implications .",
    "their results were corroborated by similarly sophisticated subsequent studies of @xcite .",
    "of these , @xcite presented the most comprehensive analysis and also compared between 1d and axisymmetric ( 2d ) results .",
    "they found that in 2d , convection in the protoneutron star alters the structure of the latter , affecting the neutrino emission starting @xmath5@xmath37 after bounce , but preserving the overall systematics with accretion rate .",
    "@xcite also were the only authors to suggest that the accretion - rate dependence of luminosity and total emitted energy in the preexplosion phase could be used to infer the structure of the progenitor .",
    "the other studies , being focused on aspects such as neutrino oscillations , black hole formation , or the late - time post - explosion evolution , did not consider observational consequences .",
    "@xcite , using a limited set of three progenitor models ( \\{@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40}@xmath41 at zams ) , found similar systematics as the aforementioned studies , but also carried out an analysis of the expected signal in various neutrino detectors in the first @xmath42 after bounce .",
    "they computed ibd interaction rates for their @xmath40-@xmath34 and @xmath38-@xmath34 and found a factor of two more ibd interactions for the former , which would allow a high - confidence distinction between these progenitors for a galactic core collapse event .",
    "however , their @xmath39-@xmath34 model yielded a postbounce neutrino signal very similar to that of their @xmath38-@xmath34 model and would be indistinguishable by neutrino observations alone .",
    "this suggests that zams mass is not a good parameter to describe presupernova stellar structure ( cf . , @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we present a fresh look at the progenitor dependence of the neutrino signature in the preexplosion accretion phase of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "we perform 1d general relativistic radiation - hydrodynamics core collapse simulations of 32 progenitor models from the single - star solar - metallicity presupernova model suite of @xcite and follow the postbounce preexplosion evolution for @xmath43 . in zams mass , these models range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , but guided by the previous results discussed in the above , we choose not to parameterize our simulations by zams mass .",
    "instead we employ the compactness parameter @xmath44 ( for a relevant mass scale @xmath45 , measured at the time of bounce ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , and further explored in @xcite , @xmath46 is a quantitative stellar structure parameter that describes the postbounce accretion evolution to a remnant mass scale @xmath45 .",
    "we demonstrate that the preexplosion neutrino emission is very well parameterized by the compactness .",
    "the preexplosion luminosities and mean energies of all neutrino species increase essentially monotonically with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "we compute predicted integrated ibd interactions for a galactic core - collapse supernova in the super - kamiokande detector and show that the clear systematics governed by @xmath46 carries over to observation , even when standard msw neutrino oscillations are taken into account .",
    "our results thus indicate that  in the absence of complicated collective neutrino oscillations  a high - statistics detection of neutrinos from the preexplosion phase will allow , in principle , a tight constraint of the compactness of the progenitor star s core .",
    "this , however , will require knowledge of the nuclear eos and of the rotation rate of the collapsed core , since , as we show , both can dilute the otherwise clear compactness - dependent neutrino emission systematics .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in ",

    "finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] , we critically summarize our work and conclude by contrasting our results with the early neutrino signal observed from sn 1987a .",
    "we make use of the open - source 1d general relativistic hydrodynamics code ` gr1d ` ( @xcite ; available at http://www.stellarcollapse.org ) outfitted with an energy - dependent multi - species m1 neutrino transport scheme in which the zeroth and first moments of the neutrino distribution function are evolved .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on ` gr1d ` and describe in the following our current implementation of the transport scheme . for this first application",
    ", we neglect the computationally - expensive energy - coupling neutrino interactions and transport terms  these terms are undoubtedly important for making highly accurate predictions of the neutrino signature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but are unlikely to affect the general trends we observe .",

    "a complication arises when solving the neutrino moment equations in the high - opacity limit . in this case",
    ", the standard fluxes returned from the riemann solver are dominated by a numerical diffusion term .",
    "we follow @xcite and modify the fluxes to correct for this .",

    "two facts lead us to this conclusion .",
    "the collapse time discrepancy between the ` vertex ` ( @xmath106ms ) and ( @xmath107ms ) and ` nugr1d ` ( @xmath108ms ) can be explained by the lack of inelastic scattering .",
    "@xcite gives a @xmath109ms in when neutrino - electron inelastic scattering is neglected .",
    "this collapse time difference , @xmath540ms , is the difference in the silicon - oxygen interface accretion times .",

    "( _ iv _ ) another difference between the evolution in ` nugr1d ` and the full boltzmann transport results arises in the collapse phase .",

    "neutrinos from electron capture on free protons down - scatter off of electrons to lower energies .",
    "since the optical depth is lower , these neutrinos can then escape , deleptonizing the core .",
    "in our simulations , these high - energy neutrinos can not down - scatter and therefore can not escape .",
    "deleptonization is suppressed until later phases , when central density and temperature are higher .",

    "the root mean squared @xmath12 energies predicted by ` nugr1d ` are higher during the prebounce phase , because the neutrinos do not experience the down - scattering via inelastic neutrino  electron scattering .",
    "overall , we find that differences in the inner core structure and composition at bounce do not strongly present themselves in the neutrino signal after the collapse phase .",
    "therefore , for this study , we find the current version of ` nugr1d ` to be acceptable , since our primary focus is the neutrino signal of the preexplosion accretion phase .",
    "we do note , however , that the lack of energy - coupling terms in our transport can cause qualitative differences near black hole formation .",

    "this effect can be captured with ` gr1d ` s leakage scheme in which it is trivial to include redshift terms @xcite .",
    "capturing redshift in an energy - dependent transport scheme requires energy - group coupling .",
    "we have also compared our m1 scheme to the results of @xcite for the 40@xmath34 model from @xcite using the ls180 eos . in this model a black hole forms within 500ms of bounce .",

    "more importantly , the rate of interactions in the preexplosion phase will give us detailed information on the progenitor core structure .    in order to more directly quantify the differences between variations in progenitor compactness and variations in the nuclear eos , we plot in the inset of the number of expected ibd detected interactions in a super - kamiokande - like water cherenkov detector at various postbounce times versus @xmath96 .",
    "there is a well defined trend : the number of ibd interactions detected in the first 100 , 200 , 300 , and 400ms increases with the compactness parameter of the models . for reference , we include the expected number of interactions at 200 and 400ms for both eos in .",
    "we find that the eos dependence of the expected number of interactions is similar to the eos dependence of the total emitted @xmath13 energy : the hshen eos leads to a lower number of interactions ( compare the inset of to the center panel of ) .",
    "the dependence on eos is somewhat stronger here , since the the lower average @xmath13 energy predicted from stiffer eos translates into a reduced cross section in earth - based detectors .",

    "if such a measurement was made , and there is not a significant amount of rotation ( see the discussion on rotation in ) , one can immediately infer the gravitational binding energy of the remnant , since neutrinos carry away the vast majority ( @xmath1231% of the energy is predominantly shared among the kinetic energy of the explosion , the original binding energy of the unbound stellar mantle , and the binding energy of the iron core at the onset of collapse . ] ) of the gravitational binding energy . for typical nuclear eos like the ones considered here ,",
    "this results in a one - to - one mapping of the released gravitational binding energy to the baryonic mass of the remnant , and , hence , the gravitational mass of the remnant .",

    "our results show , in agreement with previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that the @xmath12 signal from the neutronization burst emerging shortly after bounce has very little progenitor dependence , due to the universal nature of homologous inner core collapse .",
    "the neutrino signal in the postbounce preexplosion phase is determined primarily by the accretion luminosity of outer iron core , silicon shell , and oxygen shell material .",
    "the postbounce accretion rate depends on the inner structure of the progenitor at the presupernova stage .",

    "we caution the reader by noting that the very low number statistics make it hard to draw any conclusions regarding the progenitor of sn1987a . ]",
    "the monotonic dependence of the preexplosion neutrino emission on progenitor compactness translates directly to the neutrino signal observed by detectors , provided collective neutrino oscillations do not lead to complicated swaps of flavor spectra that brake the dependence of the observed signal on progenitor structure .",
    "neutrino observations of the next nearby core collapse event thus may , in principle , allow quantitative constraints on the inner structure of the progenitor star .",

    "ii are consistent with being ibd interactions @xcite .",

    "phase the expected number of detected interactions from an oscillated @xmath20 spectrum can be significantly smaller than the electron - type neutrino luminosity due to the smaller neutrino luminosity in the accretion phase . while the quantitative results obviously depend on neutrino oscillation details ,",
    "the qualitative trend with @xmath46 is unbroken .",
    "comparing our predictions with the interactions observed from sn 1987a one notes ( but must keep the very small - number statistics in mind ) that either the explosion must have occurred early in the postbounce phase and/or the progenitor must have had a relatively low @xmath96 . stated another way , that data strongly disfavors a late - time explosion in a high compactness model .",
    "both of these statements are broadly consistent with the previous work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also not inconsistent with the proposed zams mass of @xmath5@xmath155 for sanduleak  @xmath156  @xmath157 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the blue supergiant progenitor star of sn 1987a .",
    "however , the mapping between zams mass and stellar structure ( i.e. , compactness ) at the presupernova stage appears to be highly non - monotonic ( cf .",

    "all affect the preexplosion neutrino signature in ways that may be degenerate with variations in the compactness parameter .",

    "rapid rotation , which decreases both ( angle - averaged ) luminosities and average neutrino energies , can be constrained by gravitational wave observations of a galactic event ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "distance uncertainties from electromagnetic observations , which translate into uncertainties in the absolute luminosities , can be reduced by exploiting the generic neutronization burst as a standard candle @xcite .",
    "collective neutrino oscillations are not yet fully understood and have not been directly incorporated in neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "they may lead to one or multiple energy - dependent swaps of spectra between flavors and could thus complicate the mapping between neutrino signal and compactness parameter .",
    "however , the recent understanding suggests that collective oscillations may not be significant in the preexplosion phase ( @xcite ; but : @xcite and @xcite ) .    our goal with this study was to highlight overall trends of the preexplosion neutrino signal with progenitor structure in the limit of spherical symmetry .",
    "we expect these overall trends to be robust and to carry over to the multi - dimensional case .",
    "we did not aim at making precise and robust quantitative predictions for any individual model .",
    "these are not possible with our current spherically - symmetric radiation - hydrodynamics treatment , which neglects inelastic scattering , redshift and velocity dependent terms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rotation is included only in an angle - averaged manner and other important multi - dimensional dynamics , in particular convection and the standing - accretion shock instability @xcite , can not be captured .",
    "future work to remove these limitations will be necessary to produce the reliable signal predictions necessary for drawing quantitative conclusions from neutrino observations of the next nearby core - collapse supernova .",
