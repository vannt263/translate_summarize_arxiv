    "almost half a century ago , @xcite proposed that some supernovae may originate from the degenerate remnants of stellar evolution .",
    "these objects are known as type  ia supernovae ( sn  ia ) and are commonly believed to be the end points of the evolution of intermediate mass stars in close binary systems @xcite .",
    "the two most attractive theories of formation of type  ia supernovae are the single - degenerate ( sd ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and double - degenerate ( dd ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) , in striking contrast to that of type  ii supernovae . evidence supporting the sd scenario has been collected only recently and in some cases requires more careful analysis .",
    "some examples include observations of accreting massive white dwarfs @xcite , evidence of hydrogen - rich material in the vicinity of the supernova , likely associated with a companion star hamuy+03 , and the presence of the fast moving nondegenerate star inside a post - type  ia supernova remnant @xcite , a possible companions of the supernova progenitor . in the case of the dd formation channel ,",
    "several close binary white dwarf systems with total mass around chandrasekhar mass have been identified during the last few years @xcite , essentially confirming double degenerates as prospective progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae .    here",
    "we limit our considerations to a single - degenerate scenario in which the ignition of the degenerate matter takes place in the core of a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf .",
    "only a small difference is expected between the outcomes of the core ignition of a massive white dwarf formed through either the sd or dd channel . in the latter case ,",
    "the explosion is perhaps born in the core of a massive rotating white dwarf @xcite , a remnant of the final merger phase that does not result in an instantaneous explosion @xcite .    in defining the initial conditions for multidimensional hydrodynamic models ,",
    "we were guided in this study by results of the recent analytic @xcite and preliminary numerical @xcite studies of conditions prevailing in the white dwarf s core just prior to the thermonuclear runaway .",
    "our limited knowledge of that evolutionary phase grants us certain freedom in defining starting models .",
    "both the number of the ignition points and the timing of the ignition are free parameters of the current models .",
    "following the failure of carbon @xcite and helium detonation models @xcite , explosion modeling has focused on deflagration models and their derivatives .",
    "this preference has been firmly established after the apparent success of parametrized one - dimensional pure deflagration models @xcite .",
    "they , along with the later variant known as a delayed - detonation model @xcite brought the parametrized models into qualitative agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "multi - dimensional studies initially included both 2-dimensional models of deflagrations @xcite and detonations @xcite . during the last decade",
    ", sophisticated 3-dimensional models have dominated the scene .",
    "central single - point @xcite as well as multi - point ignition deflagrations @xcite seem to produce subluminous events with highly mixed ejecta .",
    "although models with a parametrized deflagration - to - detonation transition @xcite appear to address both deficiencies , the mechanism behind the transition to detonation demands explanation .",
    "there exists evidence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite ) that the compositional structure of the ejecta obtained in multi - dimensional centrally - ignited deflagrations may not be compatible with observations . at the same time ,",
    "spectroscopic and polarization observations of several sne  ia suggest the existence of strongly inhomogeneous outer ejecta layers rich in intermediate elements @xcite .",
    "these two apparently contradictory requirements can possibly be reconciled within a class of hybrid models that combine deflagration and detonation within a single evolutionary sequence . here",
    "we introduce a detonating failed deflagration ( dfd ) model , a generalization of our early exploratory study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pcl ) , in which both essential elements are naturally present . in this model",
    ", the inhomogeneities in the outer ejecta layers result from the large scale perturbation of the surface stellar layers induced by an off - center deflagration that fails to unbind the star . in the long term",
    ", that perturbation eventually leads to the formation of isolated shock - dominated regions that serve as ignition points for a detonation .",
    "the resulting event is luminous with a composite ejecta structure consisting of smoothly distributed detonation products in the central regions surrounded by inhomogeneous , turbulent - like outer layers composed of material partially burned in the deflagration .",
    "our numerical investigations include certain simplifications with the assumption of axisymmetry being potentially the most important one .",
    "this , however , will allow us to conduct a small parameter study exploring the dependence of the explosion parameters on the initial conditions . in turn , for the first time , we will be able to offer evidence that the simplifying assumptions regarding the geometry may not be the major deficiency of our models .",
    "we study the hydrodynamic evolution of a massive white dwarf using the flash  code @xcite . flash  has been the subject of rather extensive verification and validation in both subsonic and supersonic regimes @xcite .",
    "we used a customized version of the code based on the flash2.4 release with specialized modules designed to model deflagrations and detonations .",
    "we recorded the history of individual fluid elements with tracer particles for the purpose of future detailed nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "we solved the time - dependent reactive euler equations of self - gravitating flow in cylindrical geometry assuming axial symmetry .",
    "the non - reactive set of equations were extended by an advection - diffusion - reaction ( adr ) equation describing the evolution of a deflagration front .",
    "the solution to the adr equation was obtained with the help of a flame capturing method @xcite .",
    "the flash  implementation has been the subject of verification @xcite with the results of the application to turbulent flames closely matching the original implementation @xcite .      for the present application ,",
    "several elements of the original adr scheme were modified .",
    "in particular , careful analysis of the original three - stage flash  burner ( * ? ? ? * pcl ) revealed that it overestimated the amount of energy produced by burning the stellar mix to nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) at densities typical of the stellar core .",
    "as a consequence , the nuclear ashes were both too hot and too rarefied , with buoyancy effects overestimated by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "this led to a much larger acceleration of the burned material , shorter evolutionary time scales ( from ignition to bubble breakout ) , a lower consumption of stellar fuel and a correspondingly lower degree of pollution of the surface layers .",
    "the current scheme captures the energetics of the deflagrating material more closely .",
    "we also introduced a revised formula for the laminar flame speed that better approximates the results of @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the evolution of a deflagrating stellar material can be considered as a sequence of largely independent processes .",
    "carbon burning ( stage i ) is followed by relaxation toward nuclear statistical quasi - equilibrium ( nsqe ) that produces silicon - group nuclei ( stage ii ) .",
    "eventually , the matter relaxes toward nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) producing iron - group nuclei ( stage iii ) . in the approximate burner , this is modeled through modifying the composition in all three stages .",
    "stage i converts carbon into @xmath5 while @xmath6 is produced in stage ii by the `` burning '' of @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also extended the original scheme by introducing a `` light nucleus '' that accounts for the presence of free alpha particles and protons in the very high density and temperature regime ( stage iii , see below ) .",
    "the original flash  approximate burning scheme assumed the energy release was a simple sum of the nominal differences between the binding energy of the initial c / o mix and the burned material , @xmath8 , independent of density .",
    "this is over 70% more than the energy release obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  2 , @xmath9 ) for the densities of interest during the initial explosion stages , @xmath10 .",
    "our revised scheme uses results obtained with the torch47network @xcite in the self - heating mode .",
    "the outcome of such calculations depends on the initial temperature of the fuel .",
    "calculations also need to be conducted for long enough to guarantee a complete burn .    in our first set of calculations",
    ", we advanced the network for a fixed amount of time , @xmath11 , where @xmath12  s is the hydrodynamic ( free - fall ) time scale @xcite .",
    "calculations were started using several different initial temperatures of the mixture , @xmath13  k. we found a relatively weak dependence of the energy release on the initial temperature ( fig .",
    "[ f : de_rho_ti ] )    .",
    "the highest amount of energy is released for @xmath14  k and the lowest for @xmath15  k. the energy release is essentially insensitive to the initial temperature for densities @xmath16 . [",
    "f : de_rho_ti],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    and adopted @xmath17  k in subsequent calculations .",
    "once the initial temperature was fixed , we turned our attention to studying the time - dependence of the energy release .",
    "we found that for @xmath18 the bulk of the energy is released within @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ f : de_rho_tau ] ) .",
    "k. the bulk of the energy is produced within a single hydrodynamic time scale , @xmath20 .",
    "thick solid lines correspond to the energy release adopted in our supernova explosion calculations .",
    "[ f : de_rho_tau],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the supernova calculations that follow , we used the energy release obtained for @xmath17  k and @xmath11 ( thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ f : de_rho_tau ] ) .",
    "the energy release was tabulated as a function of density with resolution 0.1  dex and linearly interpolated .",
    "the flame extinction was modeled by smoothly decreasing the original energy release for densities @xmath21 .",
    "no energy was released for densities below @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to the original flash  implementation of stage iii in which @xmath23 was the sole product of burning , here we introduced additional `` light nuclei '' composed of alpha particles and protons .",
    "this allowed us to better approximate the temperature , and in turn the buoyancy and dynamics of the rayleigh - taylor unstable burning front , especially at early times .",
    "as before , we used the torch47nuclear network in an isochoric self - heating mode of burning to determine the composition of the light nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ f : xlight_rho ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    these results appeared insensitive to the particular choice of the initial temperature or the final time provided the network was evolved for at least @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to tracing the compositional evolution of the nuclear ashes , the implementation of the khokhlov s three - stage burner involves the coupling of the energy source term to hydrodynamics . in what follows we",
    "are primarily concerned with the early evolutionary stages when the physical time scales associated with nuclear burning are much shorter than a flame crossing time for computational zones @xcite .",
    "when the evolution of the burning region is relatively slow and the expansion of the star is insignificant , as it is during the early evolution of centrally ignited deflagrations , a step - wise form of the energy production rate leads to large ( about two orders of magnitude ) rapid fluctuations in the energy deposition .",
    "these localized discrete `` explosions '' occur in partially - burned material where degeneracy is lifted and are a source of pressure waves and velocity fluctuations of order @xmath24 km / s .",
    "a similar problem in the context of modeling deflagrations fronts was noted by @xcite who used , however , a completely different procedure to model the flame evolution .",
    "the origin of the problem , i.e.  discrete representation of a thin unresolved burning front , is common to both studies .",
    "the impact of the numerical artifact just described can be limited by appropriately scaling the energy deposition in stage ii ( no such procedure is needed in stage i which always operates under strongly degenerate conditions and no energy is released in stage iii ) . in the simulations presented here ,",
    "the energy generation rate for stage ii was kept at 1% of its nominal value throughout simulations .",
    "given the advection time scale @xmath25  s , this procedure affected the energy release only at very high densities for which the problem of spurious numerically - induced flow perturbations was originally identified .",
    "alternatively , one can also consider less intrusive procedures in which the energy generation rate is limited only for times @xmath26  s. imposing less strict limitations on the energy release was found to universally produce velocity perturbations of magnitude comparable to that of large scale flows .",
    "several factors may cause the numerical flame speed propagation to differ from the prescribed laminar flame speed in one dimension . @xcite",
    "have investigated in some detail the influence of numerical resolution , evolution with a superimposed constant background velocity mimicking hydrodynamic advection ( i.e.to verify galilean invariance ) , and the impact of velocity gradients across the flame front ( presumably caused by thermal expansion in real applications ) .    in the supernova context , given the degenerate nature of the equation of state , thermal expansion is controlled by the energy release which chiefly depends on the fuel density and composition @xcite .",
    "therefore whenever the flame energetics are modified , an appropriate calibration of the numerical parameters controlling the numerical flame speed needs to be done for the numerical flame speed to match the nominal ( laminar ) flame speed .",
    "the calibration procedure is relatively simple , but tedious because the numerical flame speed depends on density , composition , and numerical resolution . given our focus is on the evolution of progenitors composed of a 50/50 carbon / oxygen mix , our flame speed calibration was limited to that composition .",
    "we performed a number of one - dimensional flame propagation simulations in cartesian geometry .",
    "models were obtained on grids with lengths between @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29  km , and using between @xmath30 and @xmath31 zones .",
    "the typical grid resolution was @xmath32  km .",
    "the results showed only weak dependence on the resolution .",
    "the flame propagation was , however , somewhat vulnerable to background flow fluctuations generated by the flame front motion that freely propagated and partially reflected off the boundaries .",
    "although we used non - reflecting ( zero gradient ) boundary conditions , such reflections are understandable given the subsonic nature of the problem . in our analysis",
    "we used data from carefully selected long evolutionary sequences computed on the largest grids and at the highest possible resolution .",
    "our calibration procedure was applied toward a slightly modified formula originally proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  43 ) : @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "this improved formula reproduces @xcite results for a c / o 50/50 mix to within 15% for densities between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "finally , this has been adjusted to account for thermal expansion due to the torch47energetics : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is polynomial density - dependent correction factor based on our calibration calculations and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the final formula reproduces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  3 ) results to within 5% for densities in the range @xmath38 and @xmath47 .",
    "our initial investigations into late evolutionary stages of fizzle off - center deflagrations ( pcl ) provided strong evidence that the conditions inside the confluence region at the stellar surface are appropriate for creating a detonation .",
    "we observed that both densities and temperatures were high enough for the burning time scale to become shorter than hydrodynamic time scale .",
    "we also anticipated that the shocked region would remain confined for an extended period of time sufficient to develop a self - sustained detonation .",
    "we were unable , however , to study that process in detail at that time .",
    "the burning module could not reliably discriminate between shocked fuel ( a legitimate detonation site ) and compressed partially burned matter . here",
    "we introduce a hybrid burning scheme to allow for the simultaneous presence of deflagrations and distributed nuclear burning in the simulation .",
    "deflagrations are modeled using the adr flame - capturing scheme @xcite with modifications as outlined above .",
    "the distributed burning is calculated using the flash  aprox13 t 13-isotope alpha network ( g.  jordan 2005 , private communication ) this network is an extension of the original flash  approx13 network and includes temperature coupling for increased stability of calculations in the nse regime @xcite .",
    "the first step in our our hybrid burning procedure is to identify shocked zones .",
    "this is done using a multidimensional shock detection module adopted from the sppm  code @xcite with pressure jump across the shock , @xmath48 .",
    "if the temperature in such zones is high enough for nuclear burning ( @xmath49  k ) , a progress variable used by the adr flame module is reinitialized and the numerical flame speed is set to zero .",
    "the flame module is subsequently activated only if the flame speed is greater than zero and the material is pure fuel ( as indicated by , for example , a small abundance of nuclei not participating in the simplified three - stage burner ) . otherwise , the nuclear network is called but only if the following conditions are fulfilled simultaneously : ( 1 ) both the density and temperature are in the range appropriate for the network calculations , ( 2 ) the zone is outside a shock front , ( 3 ) the deflagration module was not used , and ( 4 ) the adr progress variable is small .",
    "the first condition limits network calculations to high - density ( @xmath50 ) high - temperature ( @xmath51 k ) regimes .",
    "condition ( 2 ) follows from the conclusions of @xcite who found that the correct speed of detonation waves can be obtained only in models with burning disallowed inside unrelaxed numerical shock profiles .",
    "conditions ( 3 ) ensures only one physical burning process , either distributed burning following shock heating or deflagration , operates at a time .",
    "finally , condition ( 4 ) prevents burning from occurring in regions preheated by an extended diffusive tail of the adr flame capturing scheme and at the same time allows for burning to continue after the detonation wave sweeps through partially deflagrated material . by making the progress variable threshold for use of nuclear network slowly increasing with time",
    ", we also prevented spurious ( distributed ) burning in the dense central regions perturbed by ascending deflagrating material .",
    "the above scheme captures the essential behavior of both deflagrations and wave - induced distributed burning .",
    "it allows for the transition to detonation in shock - heated regions away from deflagrating material and enables burning in shocked , partially deflagrated material .",
    "the above selection rules were developed and improved based upon experience accumulated in the course of several numerical experiments and , as such , offers a practical rather than ideal recipe for modeling deflagrations and detonations in the same physical setting including a possible deflagration to detonation transition .    once the detonation wave is launched , a combination of a ppm hydrodynamic solver , a multidimensional shock detection algorithm , and a aprox13 t nuclear burning module was used to advance the evolution in time .",
    "the evolution of the detonation wave on a large scale is expected to be captured correctly given that the thickness of the wave is much smaller than the stellar radius @xcite .",
    "we did not find it necessary to rescale nuclear reaction rates in order to obtain the correct propagation of the detonation speeds @xcite ; excluding the unrelaxed shock profile from burning appeared sufficient to yield physical solutions .",
    "one of primary motivations behind development of a hybrid burning scheme was desire to mitigate a risk of spurious detonation ignitions .",
    "the existence of such spurious ignitions is a well - documented fact in astrophysical literature @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly discuss the most typical causes for spurious ignitions and possible ways to prevent them from polluting hydrodynamical models .",
    "perhaps the most common cause for spurious detonation ignitions is a numerically - induced mixing of hot ashes and cold fuel . by advecting a material interface ( contact discontinuity ) separating ashes from fuel",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that such mixing may result in artificial preheating of fuel , its ignition , and ultimately formation of a combustion wave .",
    "related to this is a problem of species conservation by nonlinear eulerian advection schemes . under certain conditions",
    "numerical modification of fuel ( or partially burned material ) composition may change burning energetics . either extinction or enhancement of burning may follow . to our knowledge",
    ", neither numerical species diffusion nor species non - conservation can be completely eliminated from eulerian simulations of realistic nonlinear systems .",
    "our hybrid burning scheme attempts to limit possible influence of both effects by constraining burning to regions occupied by pure fuel .",
    "transition to detonation can also follow an artificial boosting of an acoustic perturbation . such perturbations lead to local variations in temperature and under degenerate",
    "conditions temperature is a sensitive function of ( relatively small thermal ) pressure .",
    "given strong dependence of nuclear reactions on temperature , it is conceivable that even small but sustained heating may strengthen acoustic waves and eventually cause spurious transition to detonations .",
    "typically , however , small acoustic fluctuations suffer from strong damping by numerical diffusivity and such spurious transitions to detonations are likely to occur only if nuclear burning is allowed inside numerical ( unrelaxed ) shock profiles .",
    "the cure for this problem is to eliminate burning in regions occupied by shocks @xcite and , as we mentioned above , such a filter is employed in our calculations .    finally , application of nuclear burning source term in our calculations is limited to regions with sufficiently high densities and temperatures .",
    "that is , we wish to consider a feedback from nuclear burning only if the nuclear timescale is short enough to influence hydrodynamics .",
    "this approach not only saves computational time , but more importantly prevents the nuclear network from being fed with input data representing low - density regions where evolution has a highly transient character and is not correctly captured in our calculations .    to summarize , numerical computations of reactive flows pose extreme challenges and require very careful treatment .",
    "we attempted to address several known and some newly emerged problems related to coupling reactive source terms to hydrodynamics in great detail .",
    "the impact of some of these problems could only be limited , but not completely eliminated .",
    "for example , in our models no nuclear burning is allowed inside numerical shock profiles .",
    "however , our particular choice of parameters defining numerical shock profile may not be adequate in all situations affecting evolution of shocks and acoustics in unwanted manner .",
    "poor numerical resolution only adds to the algorithmic inefficiency further limiting predictive abilities of our models .",
    "clearly , successfully resolving technical problems of our computations is of high priority and such aspects should be remembered when interpreting our results . at the same time , however , one should also keep in mind that our model involves several simplifying assumptions ( i.e. , we consider a non - rotating , non - convective , non - magnetized chemically homogeneous progenitor ) , and as such it is a blend of approximate numerics and unique choice of parameters defining physical scenario",
    ".      given that both the basic hydrodynamic module as well as the flash implementation of the flame capturing scheme have been extensively verified and , albeit to a limited extent , also validated in the past @xcite , our verification is solely limited to code - to - code comparison in the context of thermonuclear supernova explosion modeling .",
    "although code - to - code comparison is widely popular among computational physicists , the usefulness of this approach is hotly debated @xcite .",
    "for one , even perfect agreement between the simulation results of two codes does not offer proof of their correctness .",
    "moreover , the scope of such an exercise is usually limited by the specific capabilities of the code , the availability of the results , the completeness of documentation , and the relevance of the performed test to the actual problem at hand , to name a few . here",
    "we accept the obvious deficiencies of the code - to - code comparison approach and use highly relevant and state - of - the - art calculations as a benchmark .",
    "again , due to the novelty of our ultimate application , no data are available for comparison , though they will hopefully become available through independent calculations .",
    "ultimately , the model will be validated using accumulated observational evidence .",
    "methodology and methods required in such assessments are presented in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .      for our comparison study we selected a family of",
    "centrally ignited deflagration models obtained by the garching group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these studies are very well - documented and their results compare favorably to those obtained by other groups @xcite . when comparing results , we considered the overall morphology of the explosion ( flame front structure ) , the energetics and the approximate ejecta composition of the 2-dimensional explosion calculations reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our choice of 2-d garching models is natural given our calculations to follow also assume axial symmetry .    in a benchmark study we used flash2.4 customized for the thermonuclear supernova explosion problem .",
    "we used a ppm module for real gas inviscid hydrodynamics and the helmholtz equation of state required by the degenerate conditions encountered in the white dwarf interior .",
    "all calculations were done with courant factor @xmath52 .",
    "this choice of time step limiter may appear somewhat conservative , but allows for better coupling between different physical processes .",
    "gas self - gravity was accounted for by solving the poisson equation through multipole expansion .",
    "we found that linear momentum is poorly conserved in explosion calculations when the expansion series is truncated too early , especially when the explosion displays significant asymmetries . in test calculations",
    "done assuming a spherical potential , the bulk of the stellar material displayed motion of a few hundred km / s after only a few seconds of evolution .",
    "the momentum conservation gradually improved as additional higher order terms were included in the expansion . in what follows we used 10 multipole moments and found excellent momentum conservation for all initial conditions considered .",
    "we used a 2-dimensional cylindrical grid @xmath53 and assumed axial symmetry .",
    "this implied imposing a reflecting boundary condition at @xmath54 .",
    "we applied outflow conditions at the remaining boundaries . in our verification calculations the computational domain covered a rectangular region with @xmath55 km .",
    "we used the adaptive capabilities of the flash  code to create several levels of refinement up to a maximum resolution of 8  km .",
    "we do not expect the dynamical evolution of low density gas or at large distances from the stellar center to play an important role in explosion simulations and therefore adaptive refinement was used only for radii @xmath56  km and if the gas density @xmath57 .",
    "self - gravity calculations , on the other hand , require good resolution of dense regions and the grid refinement was forced to the highest allowed resolution whenever the gas density @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , the innermost @xmath59  km of the star have always been resolved with the finest zones . in regions where adaptivity was allowed ,",
    "amr patches were created dynamically if the local density contrast exceeded @xmath60 or the total velocity changed by more than 20% .",
    "furthermore , we ensured the flame front was always refined to the finest level by forcing refinement whenever the fractional change of the flame progress variable exceeded @xmath61 .",
    "the supernova progenitor was an isothermal , @xmath62  k , white dwarf composed of equal mass fractions of carbon and oxygen . with a central density of @xmath63 , the progenitor had a radius @xmath64  km , total mass @xmath65 , and total energy @xmath66 erg .",
    "the progenitor was surrounded by a low density ( @xmath67 ) and low temperature ( @xmath68  k ) medium composed of pure helium . the stellar material and low density ambient medium",
    "were initially marked with a passively advected tracer that was set to @xmath69 and @xmath70 in those two regions , respectively .",
    "subsequently , gas gravitational accelerations were multiplied by the tracer value in the course of the evolution , allowing us to prevent the ambient medium from collapsing onto the central object and limiting mass diffusion at the stellar surface .",
    "the original progenitor model was constructed using a numerical discretization different from the one used in the hydrodynamic simulations and assuming a simplified equation of state .",
    "for that reason , the perfect hydrostatic equilibrium of the original model was destroyed as soon as it was interpolated onto the simulation mesh . even though the mismatch between the two computational environments was relatively small , very strong acoustic oscillations quickly developed making such a model unsuitable for further investigations .",
    "moreover , the oscillations did not decay with time , presumably due to both low dissipation of the hydrodynamic scheme and the strong degeneracy of the medium .",
    "we constructed a stable progenitor model using a modified variant of the damping method of @xcite in a 1-d flash  simulation in spherical geometry .",
    "our procedure combined a very slow diffusion of velocity together with a partial rather than complete ( as in the original method ) removal of excess momentum after each time step .",
    "we found that the complete removal of momentum prevented the model from reaching equilibrium .",
    "damping process usually lasted several thousands of hydrodynamic steps .",
    "we examined the stability of the relaxed model by computing a sequence of hydrodynamic models without burning .",
    "random velocity perturbations with amplitude of @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) were added to the inner core region of radius @xmath73  km .",

    "km ( dashed ) .",
    "the initial models were perturbed by adding random velocities with amplitude @xmath71 inside the stellar core .",
    "note that the velocity gently decays in models calculated with a resolution of @xmath74  km or better .",
    "[ f : static_vrms],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we also computed the evolution of an `` effective '' stellar radius corresponding to the volume occupied by gas with density @xmath75 representing the bulk of the stellar matter .",

    "the model using @xmath77  km resolution shows very strong expansion , making it unsuitable for long - term hydrodynamic evolution studies .",
    "[ f : static_radius],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as one can see , the model stellar radius shows significant evolution in computations with resolution @xmath74  km or worse ; only a very modest ( @xmath78 ) decrease of radius was observed in the better resolved models , and had no consequence for structure of the stellar core ( i.e.  possible temperature increase ) .",
    "unfortunately , close examination of the velocity field also revealed that while the overall stability of models improves with increasing resolution , small velocity perturbations not only do not decay but are amplified near the symmetry axis .",
    "this effect was especially strong in @xmath79  km resolution model where the velocity near the axis rapidly increased from the initially imposed @xmath71 to @xmath80 during the first @xmath81  s of the evolution ( shown with the thin solid line in fig .",

    "[ f : static_vaxis],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    no significant increase in the magnitude of the spurious velocities was observed at later times , but the affected region expanded from the initial 1 to 3 zones by @xmath83  s. we observed very similar behavior in the @xmath84  km resolution model , although the velocities near the symmetry axis were ultimately somewhat smaller ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "in contrast , the velocities smoothly decay from their initial values in the whole perturbed region in the @xmath76  km resolution model ( shown with the thick solid line in fig .  [",

    "a similar slow decrease of the velocities near the symmetry axis was also observed in the @xmath74  km model .",
    "after a stabilized progenitor model was interpolated onto the simulation mesh , a deflagration front was initialized around a small region at the stellar center .",
    "the flame front was located at @xmath86\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the unperturbed radius of the burned region ( flame radius ) , @xmath88 is the flame radius perturbation amplitude , and @xmath89 controls the flame radius perturbation wavelength .",
    "random velocity perturbation were added to the inner core region following the procedure described above . by introducing a small stochastic component ( `` cosmic variance '' ) into the problem",
    ", we were able to examine the robustness of our results .",
    "in particular , it is essential to verify that the observables ( i.e.  the explosion energy ) do not show strong dependence on small perturbations in the initial conditions , in accord with the observed intrinsic homogeneity of sn  ia .",
    "we performed a comprehensive survey of two - dimensional centrally ignited deflagration models .",
    "the database contains 33 models .",
    "all models were evolved until @xmath90  s when burning essentially ceased . for each model",
    "we varied the flame perturbation wavelength and random velocity perturbation pattern ( through the seed perturbation ) .",
    "we explored the sensitivity of the results to mesh resolution by resolving the central stellar region of radius @xmath91 t @xmath92 for times @xmath93 .",
    "resolution coarsening in this central region was done in equal intervals of time . for times",
    "@xmath94 , the resolution was equal to a default value of @xmath76  km .",

    "table  [ t : central ]    .centrally ignited benchmark deflagration models [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     presents approximate nucleosynthetic yields and final explosion energies for the complete set of homologous dfd models .",
    "the homologous character of the models is confirmed by the consistently small fraction of potential and internal energies as compared to the total energy . in most models ,",
    "explosion energies are in the range @xmath96 foe .",
    "these produce between @xmath97 to almost @xmath98 solar masses of @xmath23 and between @xmath81 and @xmath99 solar masses of intermediate elements .",
    "although model nickel masses may appear relatively high at first , such high nickel masses might be typical for significant fraction of objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our estimates of nickel mass are likely the upper limits given aprox13 t nucleosynthesis does not account for production of other iron - group elements , e.g.  stable isotopes like @xmath100 .",
    "model y75ym50 is the least energetic ( @xmath101  erg ) , produces the least amount of nickel ( @xmath102 ) and more than a half solar mass of intermediate mass elements .",
    "as we discussed earlier , we believe that this model should not be considered as a dfd , as the shock to detonation transition was likely being promoted by numerics .",
    "we studied the fate of a massive carbon / oxygen white dwarf following an off - center mild ignition .",
    "we found that such initial configurations do not produce direct explosions .",
    "only a small amount of stellar fuel is initially consumed and the released energy is used to expand the progenitor .",
    "this is in agreement with several previous independent studies in which the deflagration was either intrinsically weak @xcite or was initiated slightly off - center @xcite .",
    "we found that the following evolution of the perturbed stellar material leads to the formation of isolated wave - dominated regions inside unburned material .",
    "we considered these regions capable of launching a detonation wave through a shock - to - detonation transition .",
    "we observed the resulting detonations eventually consuming the bulk of the unburned progenitor .",
    "these detonating failed deflagrations are energetic events with explosion energies @xmath103 foe .",
    "the model dfd ejecta appear composite , reflecting the presence of two different physical processes contributing to the explosion .",
    "the central parts of the ejecta are composed of a mildly deformed but completely featureless central core rich in iron peak elements .",
    "stronger deformations may require different physics , e.g.rotation @xcite .",
    "the core is surrounded by a slightly inhomogeneous inner ring rich in silicon group elements , a product of the detonation burning at low densities . finally , the outermost layer is highly turbulent containing a mix of deflagration products and unburned material .",
    "preliminary nucleosynthesis results indicate that dfd models typically produce over @xmath104 of iron group elements and @xmath105 intermediate elements .",
    "the burn is almost complete leaving essentially no carbon .",
    "our conclusions are based on calculations using a revised numerical scheme that contains substantial improvements .",
    "we found that the energetics of deflagration stage originally considered in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "pcl ) tended to overestimate buoyancy effects by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "we used a set of self - heating nuclear network calculations and implemented a density - dependent energy release scheme .",
    "additional modifications to the approximate nucleosynthesis were included to improve the dynamics of the early phases still further . with the revised energetics , we calibrated the numerical flame speed to match the results of detailed calculations of @xcite .",
    "the revised deflagration code was subsequently verified against an independent set of results of centrally ignited deflagrations obtained with the garching supernova code .",
    "good qualitative agreement was found between the two codes .",
    "the database of computer models is offered on - line to facilitate future verification ( code - to - code comparison ) studies .",
    "furthermore , a numerical procedure to stabilize model progenitors has been developed . these stabilized progenitors not only provided initial conditions for supernova simulations but also allowed us to examine the fidelity of hydrodynamic advection in axisymmetric situations .",
    "in particular we found that , on the one hand , no numerically stable progenitors can be obtained if resolution is too low and , on the other hand , small perturbations are strongly amplified near the symmetry axis in highly resolved models . this analysis allowed us to identify the optimal resolution for our supernova calculations .",
    "we analyzed the observed pattern of shock - to - detonation transitions ( sdts ) in some detail .",
    "we identified the presence of sufficiently dense fuel , strongly kinetic flow , wave formation , and a persistent confinement of the region with additional pressure increase due to nuclear burning in the shocked gas as necessary conditions for a sdt .",
    "we found that the phenomenon of sdt is not exclusively associated with the presence of a symmetry axis .",
    "we also found that sdts can occur in regions completely free of possible geometrical boosting effects , i.e.  near the equatorial plane .",
    "however , transitions to detonations were not a robust prediction of such models .",
    "there are some possible reasons for that .",
    "for example , by assuming axisymmetry we eliminate an angular direction in which additional perturbations may develop .",
    "such perturbations will enrich the flow field creating more seed points for sdt and , at the same time , increase the amplitude of fluctuations .",
    "that is , the assumed symmetry is likely limiting the possible wave interactions and presumably denying extreme events such as a sdt .",
    "in addition , for stability reasons , our calculations had to be performed using suboptimal numerical resolution .",
    "this caused a strong numerical damping and limited sampling of the perturbed regions harming chances for observing sdts still further . on the other hand",
    ", we did not include physics that may , effectively , make the system behavior appear more viscous ( e.g.  magnetic fields ) inhibiting formation of small scale structures .",
    "our findings also hinge on the assumption that the sdt process is relatively insensitive to details of evolution on scales unresolved in our simulations .",
    "this remains to be demonstrated , ideally in the course of dedicated highly - resolved model calculations of compressionally heated fuel - rich degenerate mixtures .",
    "it will be a daunting task .",
    "if any parallel can be drawn , experience accumulated by modelers of inertially confined fusion systems might be of great help in such studies @xcite . even if such models are successfully constructed , many doubts will remain regarding the outcome of such calculations given how limited our knowledge about real systems is . for example , as we mentioned before ( pcl ) , although we consider a pure carbon / oxygen progenitor it is almost certain that in nature progenitor s surface layers contain admixture of helium @xcite .",
    "compositional changes will affect energetics of nuclear burn adding entirely new dimension to the problem .",
    "being mindful of numerous simplifying assumptions and model inaccuracies , the essential findings of this work are , therefore , rather modest and can be summarized as evidence of strong , localized , and prolonged shock heating in regions rich in fuel .",
    "we note that these are necessary conditions for shock - to - detonation transition to occur .",
    "we believe this observation is independent of particular details of our model , especially numerics , making sdt one of prime suspects for triggering detonations in sn  ia .",
    "however , even if no seed point forms a detonation through sdt , this second , after the initial deflagration , failure to unbind the star in no way automatically implies supernova will not occur .",
    "perhaps just the opposite .",
    "the extensive large - scale mixing of deflagration products with unburned outer stellar layers combined with abundantly present strong acoustic perturbations appear the conditions are ripe for the zeldovich gradient mechanism @xcite .",
    "we may expect that for rotating progenitors @xcite perturbations of surface layers will be even stronger due to presence of additional shear component .",
    "if all these opportunities are missed , the white dwarf might still be given another chance to produce the supernova .",
    "a failed attempt to explode would then be a beginning of a cycle that repeats , perhaps several times , as the expanded white dwarf eventually cools down , shrinks , and prepares for another ignition .",
    "that is , the explosion process might be a lengthy one , a kind of laborious slow death .",
    "as the observations improve , we are also beginning to collect evidence that the degree of diversity of sn  ia might be greater than original anticipated ( or desired ! ) .",
    "recent observations of the peculiar supernova sn  2002cx by @xcite argue in favor of low energy explosion and large degree of mixing in this object , two characteristics that essentially preclude any involvement of a detonation in the explosion process .",
    "other objects listed by @xcite may belong to sn  2002cx class .",
    "these rare peculiar supernovae might be genuine examples of pure deflagrations . or perhaps these are objects that underwent several failed deflagrations leaving only small amount of material to fuel the detonation . if so , normally bright supernovae might be dfds that succeeded early , with the occurrence of a detonation ( or lack thereof ) being the primary element determining the observational properties of a given event .    on the other hand , sne  ia display some characteristics that we find difficult to explain in the framework of pure deflagrations",
    "one example are iron - rich clumps found in type  ia snrs @xcite . in the model proposed here , the inner ring of intermediate elements seems to be a natural site for producing nickel - rich blobs that may float away from the central core @xcite .",
    "those radioactive blobs may also be explained in pure deflagration models that naturally produce clumpy ejecta .",
    "however , dominant and isolated regions rich in iron - group elements like the one observed in tycho snr @xcite can hardly be produced in a pure deflagration in which several such regions are expected to be simultaneously present . in dfds",
    ", such an isolated clump located near the outer edge of the supernova remnant might be a material burned deep in the progenitor core and transported to the stellar surface by one of the deflagrating bubbles .",
    "we can not address the above question without detailed nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "this is one of the possible future directions for research .",
    "in addition , the relaxation of the assumption of axial symmetry , although costly , will be necessary . but even with only the current approximate nucleosynthesis and simplified geometry of the problem , we are in a position to conduct preliminary validation studies against observations for a subset of dfd models . this will be the subject of the next communication in this series .",
