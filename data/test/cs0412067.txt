    "in recent years , the goal of providing high speed wireless data services has generated a great amount of interest among the research community .",
    "recent information theoretic results have demonstrated that the ability of a system to support a high link quality and higher data rates in the presence of rayleigh fading improves significantly with the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas  @xcite .",
    "a very important aspect is always the availability of analytical expressions to describe the stochastic nature of the channel under consideration as given in  @xcite for the mimo channel .",
    "this offers an opportunity to obtain , e.g. , closed - form analytical formulas for the ergodic capacity or the outage mutual information of such mimo channels .",
    "e.g. , in  @xcite , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the random mutual information for independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "mimo channels was derived in the form of the inverse laplace transform and a gaussian approximation of the pdf was presented . in  @xcite ,",
    "the impact of mimo channel rank deficiency and spatial fading correlation on the mutual information was analyzed .",
    "furthermore , for correlated channels , the optimal transmit strategy and the impact of correlation on the outage probability were derived in  @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable work on a variety of new codes and modulation signals , called space - time codes , in order to approach the huge capacity of such mimo channels .",
    "the performance criteria of space - time codes were derived in  @xcite .",
    "one scheme of particular interest is the alamouti scheme  @xcite for two transmit antennas .",
    "later on ,  @xcite proposed more general schemes referred to as orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc ) with the same properties as the alamouti scheme like , e.g. , a remarkably simple maximum - likelihood decoding algorithm .",
    "interestingly , the combination of ostbc with a mimo antenna system can be represented equivalently as a single - input - single - output ( siso ) system , where the channel gain is equal to the frobenius norm of the actual mimo channel .",
    "the performance of orthogonal space - time block codes  @xcite with respect to mutual information was analyzed ( among others ) for the uncorrelated rayleigh fading case in  @xcite and for the more general case with different correlation scenarios and line of sight ( los ) components in  @xcite .",
    "ostbc exploit multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver in order to obtain transmit and receive diversity and therefore increase the reliability of the system . with the knowledge of the stochastic nature of the resulting equivalent channel due to the employment of ostbc in a mimo system , the loss in mutual information of ostbc in subject to transmission rate , number of receive antennas and channel rank was quantified in  @xcite , whereas in  @xcite a comparison of ostbc with a system applying beam - forming was presented .",
    "unfortunately , the alamouti space - time code for two transmit and one receive antennas is the only ostbc , which , to the best of our knowledge , achieves the maximum possible mutual information of a mimo system  @xcite , since we can not construct an ostbc with transmission rate equal one for more than two transmit antennas  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xcite designed a quasi - orthogonal space - time block code ( qstbc ) with transmission rate one for four and eight transmit antennas . by properly choosing the signal constellations as done in  @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to improve the ber performance with ml - detection for the codes given in  @xcite .",
    "the ber performance of qstbc with suboptimal detectors has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the performance of qstbc with respect to outage mutual information ( omi ) for the special case of one receive antenna and four or eight transmit antennas was analyzed via simulations in  @xcite and  @xcite and it was shown , that the qstbc are capable to achieve a significant portion of the mimo - omi . furthermore , it was shown in  @xcite , that qstbc in conjunction with optimal ( nonlinear ) and suboptimal ( linear ) detectors provide a tradeoff between performance and complexity .",
    "the key achievements of this paper are as follows    * we generalize the results in  @xcite to @xmath3 transmit and an arbitrary number of receive antennas . *",
    "we show , that due to the employment of qstbc the eigenvalues of the resulting equivalent channel are pairwise independent and identical ( i.i.d ) noncentral chi - square distributed with @xmath2 degrees of freedom ( @xmath4 ) with noncentrality parameter @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we show that the eigenvectors of the equivalent channel are independent of each channel realization , i.e. they are constant .    in other words",
    ", we first show that the combination of qstbc with a mimo system results also in a equivalent channel similar to ostbc and then fully characterize the stochastic nature of this equivalent channel . based on these important insights ,",
    "we are able to provide the following results    * an analytical lower bound for the outage probability achieved with qstbc , which is tight for low signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) values and also for increasing number of receive antennas ; * an upper bound on the outage probability , which is tight for high snr values . for the case of four transmit and an arbitrary number of receive antennas we derive analytical expressions for this bound",
    "* finally , we exploit the special structure of the qstbc and apply a new transmit strategy , which decouples the signals transmitted from different antennas in order to detect the symbols separately as in the case of ostbc .",
    "the performance of this linear detector is equivalent to the non - linear maximum - likelihood ( ml)-detector in  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ seq : system_model ]",
    ", we introduce the system model and establish the notation .",

    "<S> recently , a quasi - orthogonal space - time block code ( qstbc ) capable of achieving a significant fraction of the outage mutual information of a multiple - input - multiple output ( mimo ) wireless communication system for the case of four transmit and one receive antennas was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize these results to @xmath0 transmit and an arbitrary number of receive antennas @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we completely characterize the structure of the equivalent channel for the general case and show that for all @xmath0 and @xmath1 the eigenvectors of the equivalent channel are fixed and independent from the channel realization . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the eigenvalues of the equivalent channel are independent identically distributed random variables each following a noncentral chi - square distribution with @xmath2 degrees of freedom . based on these important insights into the structure of the qstbc , we derive an analytical lower bound for the fraction of outage probability achieved with qstbc and show that this bound is tight for low signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) values and also for increasing number of receive antennas . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an upper bound , which is tight for high snr values and derive analytical expressions for the case of four transmit antennas . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by utilizing the special structure of the qstbc we propose a new transmit strategy , which decouples the signals transmitted from different antennas in order to detect the symbols separately with a linear ml - detector rather than joint detection , an up to now only known advantage of orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc ) . </S>"
