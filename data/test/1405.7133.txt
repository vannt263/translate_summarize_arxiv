    "this contribution is dedicated to the memory of gerry brown who has charted and shaped up the frontiers of nuclear physics for half a century .",
    "gerry commissioned our two past reviews on exotic atoms @xcite , realizing the potential of exotic atoms to provide hints and constraints on chiral signatures in dense matter . a brief update of our work on exotic atoms appeared in the 85th birthday festschrift in honor of gerald e brown , _ from nuclei to stars _",
    ", published in 2011 @xcite . here",
    "we revisit pionic atoms , a subject to which he made significant contributions in the 1970s .",
    "it was recognised in the early 1970s that the @xmath3-nucleus interaction near threshold is determined by the @xmath3-nucleon scattering amplitude at subthreshold energies @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the @xmath4 resonance makes the @xmath3-nucleus interaction quite sensitive to the proper description of the subthreshold region .",
    "an algorithm devised to account for the subthreshold energy dependence of the meson - nucleon amplitude in evaluating the meson - nucleus strong - interaction potential in kaonic atoms and for strongly - bound @xmath3 mesons was formulated recently @xcite .",
    "it has been employed in extensive calculations using several models for @xmath3-nucleon scattering amplitudes that respect the recent siddharta results for kaonic atoms of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "another application of the same algorithm was made very recently in calculations of strongly - bound states of @xmath5 mesons in nuclei @xcite . here",
    "the proximity of the @xmath6(1535 ) resonance enhances the sensitivity to the models used for the @xmath5-nucleon interaction and to the way the subthreshold region is handled . for an up - to - date overview of applications to in - medium",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath5 mesons , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the two examples mentioned above no direct comparison with experiment could be made .",
    "although there exists a reasonably broad database of strong interaction effects in kaonic atoms , the above approach is limited to @xmath7 interactions with a single in - medium nucleon .",
    "comparison with experiments gave evidence for a sizable component of the @xmath7-nucleus potential which represents multinucleon interactions @xcite thus limiting one s ability to directly confront the model with experiment .",
    "similarly , there is no experimental information on strongly bound antikaons in nuclei , nor any accepted direct evidence for bound @xmath5 nuclear states .",
    "pion - nucleus interactions near threshold present a different scenario with respect to the above examples .",
    "no resonances are known near threshold and the real part of the pion - nucleus potential , which is part of the subthreshold algorithm , is dominated by single - nucleon interaction terms closely approximated by their free - space counterparts .",
    "relatively small contributions arise from absorption on two nucleons which gives rise to the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "moreover , the experimental database for pionic atoms is the most extensive of all exotic atoms @xcite .",
    "it is natural then to test the subthreshold approach by analysing pionic atom data where direct comparison with experiment is meaningful . on the other hand ,",
    "owing to the rather smooth energy dependence of the free - space @xmath0 interaction , such tests may not prove sufficiently sensitive to the fine details of the in - medium @xmath0 interaction even though they do provide acceptable support for the validity of the algorithm .",
    "it is therefore encouraging that the fits to pionic atom data reported here do preserve and even somewhat improve the existing level of agreement with the data , reaffirming earlier conclusions on the in - medium renormalization of the @xmath0 interaction @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we present the model behind the algorithm for handling subthreshold pion - nucleon amplitudes in the medium .",
    "results of global fits to pionic atom data are presented in section [ sec : res ] , based on empirical energy - dependence of the pion - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "the in - medium enhancement of the @xmath0 isovector @xmath8-wave amplitude @xmath1 that received attention in the last two decades is examined and the role of the @xmath9 ` minimal substitution ' requirement is discussed .",
    "a summary and discussion are given in section [ sec : summ ] .",

    "the dispersion relation corresponding to a meson of mass @xmath10 , momentum @xmath11 and energy @xmath12 in nuclear medium of density @xmath13 is traditionally written as @xcite @xmath14 in terms of a self energy ( polarization operator ) @xmath15 . introducing the meson - nuclear optical potential @xmath16 by @xmath17 ,",

    "@xmath16 is the optical potential of the meson in the medium .",
    "additional terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 were neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kg ] ) with respect to @xmath26 .    for pions ,",
    "the emphasis in past studies of medium effects has been on the density dependence of the self energy operator @xmath15 , or equivalently of the optical potential @xmath16 .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath16 is briefly reviewed in section  [ sec : potl ] below , while the energy and momentum dependence , which is the focus of the present work , is studied in section  [ sec : edep ] .",
    "the zeroth - order optical potential @xmath27 is linear in the density @xmath13 , with @xmath28 the free - space meson - nucleon @xmath28 matrix .",
    "this optical potential is real at zero energy because pions can not be absorbed at rest by a single nucleon , although they can be absorbed by the nucleus .",
    "ericson and ericson @xcite introduced @xmath29 terms into the potential to describe schematically @xmath30 absorption on pairs of nucleons .",

    "the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 are _ effective _ , implicitly density - dependent pion - nucleon isoscalar and isovector @xmath8-wave scattering amplitudes evolving from the free - space amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath1 , respectively , and are essentially real near threshold .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 represents multi - nucleon absorption and therefore has an imaginary part .",

    "two - parameter fermi distributions are used for @xmath66 with the same diffuseness parameter as for the protons , the so - called  skin  shape @xcite which was found to yield lower values of @xmath67 for pions .",
    "the model underlying the subthreshold algorithm adopts the mandelstam variable @xmath68 as the argument transforming free - space to in - medium pion - nucleon amplitudes , where both the pion and the nucleon variables are determined independently by the respective environment of a pionic atom and a nucleus .",
    "consequently , unlike in the two - body cm system , here @xmath69 does not vanish , and one gets @xmath70 upon averaging over angles .",
    "the energies are given by @xmath71 where @xmath21 are binding energies and @xmath10 are masses .",
    "for the pion momentum we substitute locally @xmath72 with @xmath16 the pion - nucleus optical potential and @xmath22 the pion coulomb potential due to the finite - size nuclear charge distribution . for the nucleon we adopt the fermi gas model ( fgm ) , yielding in the local density approximation @xmath73 where @xmath13 is the local density , @xmath74 the average nuclear density and @xmath75 is the average nucleon kinetic energy which assumes the value 23  mev in the fgm .",

    "most of the difference between these two groups of values is believed to arise from short - range nuclear correlations at the high density regime which is inaccessible in exotic atoms .",

    "although smaller than typically @xmath9640 mev in kaonic atoms ( right panel ) , this constitutes a nonnegligible effect . the difference between pionic and kaonic atoms originates from the very different meson - nuclear @xmath8-wave potentials for these two systems . for @xmath7 , with attractive real part of the potential ,",
    "the energy shift @xmath92 is negative definite when disregarding the minimal substitution contribution . for pions ,",
