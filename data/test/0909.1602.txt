    "as a common quantum phenomenon , the tunneling through a potential barrier plays a very important role in the microscopic world and has been studied extensively since the birth of quantum mechanics .",
    "one of the earliest applications of quantum tunneling is the explanation of @xmath0 decays in atomic nuclei .",
    "the quantum tunneling effect governs also many other nuclear processes such as fission and fusion .",
    "in particular , a lot of new features are revealed in sub - barrier fusion reactions which are closely connected with the tunneling phenomena  @xcite .    for most of the potential barriers , the penetrability can not be calculated analytically  @xcite . among those potentials for which analytical solutions can be obtained ,",
    "the parabolic potential  @xcite is the mostly used in the study of nuclear fusion . by approximating the coulomb barrier to a parabola",

    "the parabolic approximation works remarkably well both for the penetrability and for the fusion cross section at energies around or above the coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "apparently the parabolic approximation breaks down at energies much smaller than the barrier height due to the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "one may calculate the penetration probability numerically by using the path integral method or the wkb approximation .",
    "however , it is highly desirable to have an analytical expression for the barrier penetrability when one introduces an energy - dependent one - dimensional potential barrier  @xcite or barrier distribution functions  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we derived a new barrier penetration formula based on the wkb approximation .",
    "the influence of the long coulomb tail in the barrier potential is taken into accout properly .",
    "therefore this formula is especially applicable to the barrier penetration with penetration energy much lower than the coulomb barrier .    as a first attempt and a test study",
    ", we apply this new formula to evaluate @xmath0 decay half - lives of atomic nuclei . for the @xmath0 decay ,",
