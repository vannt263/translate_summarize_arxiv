    "n66 is the most massive and active star forming region in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and the star cluster ngc346 is its ionizing core .",
    "it contains more than half of the known o stars in this galaxy , and associated co clouds @xcite .",
    "the upper end of its stellar mass distribution has been well studied in the recent years : very early o  type stars ( o3 ) and high mass ( 45100 m@xmath2 ) stars were found suggesting a slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) in ngc346 very similar to the slope for massive stars in lmc and solar neighborhood ( @xmath4 = _",
    "d_(log @xmath5 ) /_d_(log",
    "m ) = -1.9 ) , and an age of @xmath6 myr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference there in ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested presence of sequential star formation in ngc346 , with star formation beginning at the southwest side of the association , and spreading towards the central cluster .    while a wealth of information is available on the upper end of the stellar mass distribution in n66/ngc346 , little",
    "is known of the low end of the distribution .",
    "the smc is characterized by a dust - to - gass mass ratio that is 30 times lower than in the galaxy @xcite , and a metallicity about 1/5 than that of the galaxy .",
    "may these differences have had an impact on the cluster formation mechanism and their distribution of stellar masses ? to answer this question we began a comprehensive investigation of star formation in the smc , from the ground and with hst .",
    "this paper presents the first results on n66/ngc346 .",
    "we used the hst / acs wide field channel ( wf ) to map ngc346 in the filters f555w ( @xmath7v ) , f814w ( @xmath7i ) , and f658n ( @xmath7 h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out between july 13 and 17 , 2004 , as part of cycle 13 proposal 10248 ( pi .",
    "a. nota ) . in the broad band filters , nine deep images ( 200  @xmath8 200  each ) were obtained in each filter , partially overlapping to get optimal spatial coverage of the ngc346 region .",
    "an additional set of short exposures was taken in the same instrumental configuration to perform accurate photometry of the brightest stars .",
    "a single image of ngc346 was taken in the light of h@xmath0 , with an exposure time of 1542s sec .    in plate  1",
    ", we show the fully reduced , multidrizzled and combined v ",
    "i color composite image of ngc 346 .",
    "the image covers an area of @xmath1 5 @xmath8 5 which corresponds to @xmath9 pc , at a distance to the smc of 59.7 kpc @xcite .",
    "the exposure time in the central region is @xmath1 4100 sec in each filter . in plate",
    "2 we show the fully reduced h@xmath0 image .",
    "all images were reduced using the standard stsci acs pipeline calacs ( hst data handbook for acs ) .",
    "photometry was performed on the drizzled images by aperture and psf fitting , using the daophot package within iraf .",
    "stars were automatically detected with the routine daofind in all the frames , with a detection threshold set at 4@xmath10 above the local background level .",
    "features misinterpreted for stars , such as noise spikes , were rejected .",
    "a spatially variable psf was computed for both v and i images , using@xmath11 isolated stars in different positions of the images .",
    "no cte correction was applied . however , preliminary cte determinations indicate that such correction is small , and can therefore be neglected in this first paper without changing the overall conclusions .",
    "our final photometry is calibrated in the vegamag system , with the zeropoints adopted from sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) of 25.724 and 25.501 for the v and i filters respectively .",
    "the deep hst / acs images show an unprecedented level of detail in the ngc346/n66 complex . the ngc346 cluster at the center is resolved into at least three subclusters , and a myriad of small compact clusters is visible throughout the region . some of these clusters appear to be still embedded in dust and nebulosity , and they might be sites of recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "the diffuse nebulosity is due to the presence of h@xmath12 and [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007 in the v filter , which indicate the bright underlying hii region .",
    "this extends to the n with arches and ragged filaments , but is delineated to the s - sw by a sharp fan - like _ ridge _ , which encompasses the entire cluster .",
    "this ridge is especially evident in the h@xmath0 image of the region ( plate  2 ) .",
    "extensive dust lanes are well visible along this _ ridge_. dust patches are also visible throughout the region , most likely the remnant of the original molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the v and i photometric data with photometric error smaller than 0.1 mag was used to construct the v , v - i color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the entire ngc346 region .",
    "the cmd ( small black dots in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) contains @xmath1 80000 stars .",
    "thanks to the high photometric accuracy obtained with the acs , these stars produce a very clean cmd , with a well defined narrow main sequence ( ms ) , down to v @xmath1 26 .",
    "the photometric errors in magnitude and color are indicated directly in the cmd , as side bars .",
    "a pronounced old main sequence turnoff is clearly visible , at v @xmath1 22 , and so is the red clump , at v @xmath1 19.5 .",
    "the cmd morphology also reveals a young population , indicated by the bright , blue ms , extending from the ms of the old smc stellar population . below v @xmath1 21 mag a group of very red faint stars is detected to the right of the ms",
    "plausibly , this split ms could be due to differential reddening .",
    "however , the absence of such a split in the upper part of the ms led us to believe that these are stars that are less massive than @xmath13 m@xmath13 ( down to 0.6 m@xmath13 ) , which formed with the rest of the central cluster but have not reached the ms yet ( pre - ms stars ) .",
    "analyzing separately the stellar content of the individual clusters we resolve in the acs images , we can better characterize the local stellar population .",
    "the orange dots in figure  [ fig4 ] highlight the observational cmd for the core of ngc346 .",
    "they indicate stars within a radius of @xmath1 8@xmath14 from the cluster center .",
    "this is superimposed to the cmd of the entire region ( small black dots ) .",
    "we superimposed to these cmds isochrones for pre - ms stars from @xcite , and for ms and post - ms stars from @xcite , and @xcite , to define the age and the nature of the population observed in the central cluster .",
    "we find presence of at least two different populations :    1 .   a composite smc field population covering a wide range in age , but dominated by the 4 gyr component , 2 .   a very young population of age @xmath13 - 5 myr .",
    "stars less massive than @xmath13 m@xmath13 ( down to 0.6 m@xmath13 ) are still in the pre - ms phase , approaching the ms .    an intermediate age population ( @xmath1150 myr )",
    "might also be present .",
    "the pre - ms stars are , as expected , faint ( v @xmath15 21 ) and red ( 1.5@xmath16v - i @xmath152.2 ) .",
    "the cmd isochrone fit indicates they likely formed with the rest of the cluster ( @xmath1 3 - 5 myr ago ) , but have not reached the ms yet .",
    "they are in the mass range 0.6 - 3 m@xmath2 .",
    "their spatial distribution is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "they appear concentrated at the center of ngc346 , mostly in the central subclusters , but also in the small compact clusters that are located on a direction which is perpendicular to the ngc346 main body , extending to the ne .",
    "their spatial location appears coincident with the clumps of neutral material identified by @xcite .",
    "the spatial density of the pre - ms stars appear to decrease as we move from the center towards the s - sw _ ridge _ , where we observe the dust lanes .",
    "as also suggested by @xcite , it is likely that the region , and especially the _ ridge _ , may be a site of more recent or on going star formation , and the forming stars are still embedded in dust and too faint to be visually detected in the acs images .",
    "the region around n66/ngc346 is a remarkable region that has displayed a high level of activity in the recent past . to the ne of n66/ngc346",
    "there is a known sn remnant , snr0057 - 7226 , first identified as a bright source in _ einstein _ x - ray observations @xcite . from the expansion velocity derived from fuse observations of @xmath1150 km s@xmath17 @xcite , we can derive a dynamical timescale of 2 @xmath8 10@xmath18 yr and set a lower limit to the epoch of the sn explosion .",
    "it is clear that snr0057 - 7226 has been interacting with the surrounding region , and the o vi ciii and x - ray emission observed @xcite arises from the shock interaction .",
    "two concentric bubbles are seen to the ne in the h@xmath0 region shown in plate  2 : we believe they are most likely shaped by the powerful winds of hd5980 .",
    "observations of @xcite and @xcite have painted a detailed picture of the molecular gas and dust component in n66/ngg346 .",
    "their observations indicate that the molecular gas has mostly been dissociated by the uv radiation of the hottest stars : what has not been dissociated is detected in small , compact clumps , which appear to be spatially concident with the regions where we observe the pre - main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "specifically , their co(2 - 1 ) sest observations indicate clumps of emission in the ngc346 central cluster , and , even stronger emission along the perpendicular direction to the ngc346 main body , to the ne .",
    "these clumps are exactly where we find the highest concentration of pre - ms stars .",
    "there appear not to be much molecular gas or dust outside the ngc346 main body , casting the doubt that the sw _ ridge _ might not be at the boundary with a molecular cloud as initially suspected @xcite .",
    "we have shown that n66/ngc346 is a complex region that has been shaped by the evolution of the most massive stars , some of which have already exploded as supernova and are compressing the central region from different directions",
    ". the outstanding question will be to understand how star formation has been triggered and has been progressing in this region .",
    "further necessary work on this region includes spectroscopic characterization of the pre - main sequence stars , and spectroscopic observations of the gas kinematics . on the theoretical side , ngc346 can easily become the ideal laboratory to test current theories for star formation at low masses .",
