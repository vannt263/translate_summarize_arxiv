    "there is no more fundamental physical quantity in cosmology than the expansion rate of the universe . in recent years",
    "the present value of the expansion rate , hubble s constant , has been measured with increasing accuracy @xcite . with the exploration of the universe at redshifts of order unity , we now have information about the time evolution of the expansion rate @xcite .",
    "a most surprising result is that the time evolution of the expansion rate does not seem to be described by a matter - dominated friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological model .",
    "the usual explanation for the discrepancy is that there is a new component of the energy density of the universe , known as dark energy , that determines the recent evolution of the expansion rate .",
    "of course all indications for dark energy are _ indirect _ ; they all involve some form of the time evolution of the expansion rate .",
    "since the expansion rate of the universe is of such fundamental importance , we must understand any possible effects that would result in an expansion rate different from the flrw prediction .",
    "in this paper we study the change in the expansion rate due to perturbations of a homogeneous , isotropic , flrw model .",
    "in particular , we perform a second - order calculation of the effect of inhomogeneities on the expansion rate .",
    "we only consider modifications to the expansion rate of a matter - dominated universe , although our results can be extended to a universe containing a mixture of matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "we find that the mean corrections are a few parts in @xmath0 .",
    "the expansion rate of a perturbed flrw cosmology has been discussed in many works ( although we believe ours is the first complete second - order calculation ) .",
    "hui and seljak @xcite estimated the order of magnitude of the effect by considering a representative second - order term .",
    "they arrived at the correct mean order of magnitude of the result .",
    "some recent works @xcite suggested that small - scale contributions could give a large correction , producing an apparent accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in particular rsnen @xcite suggested that due to ultraviolet sensitivity , one of the second - order terms could give large corrections depending on boundary conditions . as we will discuss in the conclusions",
    ", we find that if one employs the correct averaging procedure the result ( at least for the terms we could compute exactly using the second - order formalism ) is well behaved in the ultraviolet and the term identified by rsnen does not result in a large correction .",
    "in addition to calculating the mean value of the expansion rate , we calculate the variance about the mean value . in calculating the variance",
    "we uncover an interesting infrared effect . at second order",
    "the expansion rate has a term proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the peculiar gravitational potential , related to the density perturbations through the cosmological poisson equation .",
    "if inflation is the origin of perturbations , then @xmath3 should be a gaussian random variable with zero mean .",
    "however , if the perturbation spectrum on super - hubble - radius scales is no bluer than a harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum , then the variance of @xmath3 formally has an infrared singularity .",
    "now if the value of @xmath3 in our local hubble volume is sufficiently large to modify the expansion rate , our perturbative expansion fails .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that if the super - hubble modes of @xmath3 have physical significance , then a nonperturbative extension of our calculation could yield a most important modification to the friedmann equation .",
    "one might even speculate that a complete treatment of the effect could explain the observed time dependence of the expansion rate on its own and obviate the need for the dark - energy assumption .",
    "since that conjecture is beyond the perturbative calculation of this paper , we will postpone discussion of this point to a subsequent communication @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the general perturbative expansion . in section [ thetasynchronous ]",
    "we calculate the corrections to the expansion rate in terms of metric fluctuations , and then express the results in terms of the density perturbation spectrum .",
    "in section [ numbercrunch ] we present the numerical results .",
    "we then conclude , followed by two technical appendices .",
    "in this section we describe how to treat the average properties of a perturbed universe up to second order in the metric variables , including the effect of the inhomogeneous gravitational field on the homogeneous background field .",
    "we then discuss the proper definition of the average expansion rate and express the effect of inhomogeneities to second order as averages of density perturbations .    by `` average , '' we mean the average over a spatial hypersurface at a given time .",
    "clearly an average defined in this way depends on the chosen coordinate system , _",
    "i.e. , _ the gauge .    we will consider a universe filled only by irrotational dust and choose the coordinates of an observer at rest with the dust ( _ i.e. , _ comoving coordinates ) , and with the same time coordinate for every point of the spatial hypersurface ( _ i.e. , _ synchronous coordinates ) .",
    "this system of coordinates can be chosen if the universe is filled by a single pressureless component .",
