    "the observations of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in trapped atomic gases have stimulated a new interest in the experimental and theoretical research of quantum gases  @xcite .",
    "bec is characterized by a macroscopic occupation in the ground state below some critical temperature @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is quite different from the ideal bose gas ( ibg ) which is generally treated within the grand canonical ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the confining trap also greatly influences the condensate properties  @xcite .",
    "although the atomic cloud is extremely dilute , the interatomic forces strongly influence the energy of the condensate cloud .",
    "the elementary excitations are also seriously affected by the interaction .",
    "the question of how the two - body forces affect the thermodynamic properties is also a subject of great interest . by using mean - field approach , based on the popov approximation the condensate fraction and the critical temperature of the trapped interacting bosons has been calculated  @xcite . a significant decrease of the condensate fraction and the same of the critical temperature for repulsive bec with respect to the prediction of non - interacting model was observed .",
    "path - integral monte carlo method has also been employed for 1d bose gas  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of observation of low - dimensional bec of hard sphere bosons  @xcite and the calculation of thermodynamic properties have also been discussed in several theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our present study is to calculate the critical temperature and condensate fraction for bec in anharmonic trap .",
    "the trap potential is modelled as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a controllable parameter . for @xmath3",
    "the quartic confinement becomes more tight .",
    "since the transition temperature @xmath0 increases in the tight trap ( with increase in @xmath2 ) , bec may be achieved more favorably in the tight trap . in the experiments",
    "this is achieved by tuning the laser intensity .",
    "it has been demonstrated that starting with a dilute interacting gas at a temperature higher than the transition temperature phase - space density required for bec can be achieved by varying the shape of the trap adiabatically  @xcite .",
    "this allows to study the kinetics of condensate formation and effect of interaction and finite number of particles on the phase transition . in the experiments , local phase - space density of an ultracold gas was adiabatically",
    "changed to obtain bec in a reversible manner by using a combination of magnetic and optical forces  @xcite .",
    "adiabatic cooling has also been studied in power - law potential  @xcite but such processes in a harmonic plus quartic potential is yet to be studied . in the present work",
    "we start with @xmath4 particle schrdinger equation which represent the @xmath4 interacting bosons in the external trap .",
    "the interatomic interaction is chosen as van der waals potential with a hard core of very short range and long - range attractive tail .",
    "we expand the condensate wave function in the basis of two - body faddeev component .",
    "the correlated basis function keeps all possible two - body correlations which facilitates us to study the beyond mean - field effect .",
    "it is to be noted that the number of bosons in the condensate varies from few hundred to several thousands which is far below the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the methodology .",
    "we discuss our results in sec .",
    "iii and draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "in our present study we adopt an ab - initio many - body technique which is known as potential harmonic expansion method ( phem ) .",
    "phem uses a truncated two - body basis set which keeps all possible two - body correlation  @xcite and hence it is an improvement over the mean - field approximation . the potential harmonic expansion method with an additional short range correlation function , called cphem ,",
    "has already been established as a very successful and useful technique for the study of dilute bec  @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe the technique .",
    "details can be found in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a system of @xmath4 identical bosons interacting via two - body potential @xmath5 and confined in an external trap has the form @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the mass of each bosons . after eliminating the center of mass motion by using standard",
    "jacobi coordinates  @xcite , defined by @xmath8 we obtain the hamiltonian of the relative motion as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the sum of all pair - wise interactions expressed in terms of the jacobi vectors . the hyperspherical harmonic expansion method ( hhem )",
    "is a convenient _ ab - initio _ many - body tool which includes all correlations  @xcite .",
    "however it can not be applied to a typical bec containing few thousands to few millions of atoms due to large degeneracy of the hh basis . to simplify things",
    "now we explore the features of experimentally achieved bec . in a typical laboratory bec",
    "the interparticle separation is very large compared to the range of interatomic interaction and hence the probabilities of three and higher body collision is negligible .",
    "so we can safely ignore the effect of three - body and higher - body correlation and can keep only the two - body correlation .",
    "it permits us to decompose the total wave function @xmath11 into two - body faddeev component for the interacting @xmath12 pair as @xmath13 it is worth to note that @xmath14 is a function of two - body separation ( @xmath15 ) only and also includes the global hyperradius @xmath16 , which is defined as @xmath17 .",
    "thus the effect of two - body correlation comes through the two - body interaction in the expansion basis .",
    "@xmath14 is symmetric under the exchange operator @xmath18 for bosonic atoms and satisfy the faddeev equation @xmath19\\phi_{ij } = -v(\\vec{r}_{ij})\\sum_{kl > k}^{n}\\phi_{kl}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the total kinetic energy operator .",
    "operating @xmath21 on both sides of equation ( 4 ) , we get back the original schrdinger equation . in this approach",
    ", we assume that when ( @xmath22 ) pair interacts , the rest are just inert spectators . thus the total hyperangular momentum quantum number as also the orbital angular momentum of the whole system is contributed by the interacting pair only .",
    "next the @xmath12th faddeev component is expanded in the set of potential harmonics ( ph ) ( which is a subset of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis and sufficient for the expansion of @xmath23 ) appropriate for the ( @xmath22 ) partition as @xmath24 @xmath25 denotes the full set of hyperangles in the @xmath26-dimensional space corresponding to the @xmath12th interacting pair and @xmath27 is called the ph basis .",
    "it has an analytic expression : @xmath28 @xmath29 is the hh of order zero in the @xmath30 dimensional space spanned by @xmath31 jacobi vectors ; @xmath32 is the hyperangle given by @xmath33 = @xmath34 .",
    "for the remaining @xmath35 noninteracting bosons we define hyperradius as @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and @xmath16 represents the global hyperradius of the condensate .",
    "the set of @xmath38 quantum numbers of hh is now reduced to _ only _ @xmath39 as for the @xmath35 non - interacting pair we have @xmath40 whereas for the interacting pair @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus the @xmath26 dimensional schrdinger equation is effectively reduced to a four dimensional equation with the relevant set of quantum numbers : hyperradius @xmath16 , orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath44 , azimuthal quantum number @xmath7 and grand orbital quantum number @xmath45 for any @xmath46 . substituting in eq(4 ) and projecting on a particular ph , a set of coupled differential equation ( cde ) for the partial wave @xmath47",
    "is obtained @xmath48u_{kl}(r)\\\\ + & \\displaystyle{\\sum_{k^{\\prime}}}f_{kl}v_{kk^{\\prime}}(r ) f_{k^{\\prime}l } u_{k^{\\prime}l}(r ) = 0 \\hspace*{.1 cm } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] + where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "+ @xmath53 is a constant and represents the overlap of the ph for interacting partition with the sum of phs corresponding to all partitions  @xcite .",
    "the potential matrix element @xmath54 is given by @xmath55      in the mean - field gp theory the inter - atomic interaction is modelled by the @xmath56-potential whose strength is characterized by the @xmath57-wave scattering length @xmath58 only .",
    "thus it completely ignores the detailed structure of the interaction potential .",
    "however we have already reported that shape - dependent interaction potential is indeed necessary for the description of experimental bec  @xcite .",
    "so in our present study , we model the inter - atomic interaction by a realistic potential such as van der waals potential with a hard core at short separation and having an attractive @xmath59 tail at large separation .",
    "due to the use of such realistic the two - body potential with detailed structure , it becomes necessary to incorporate an additional short range correlation function in the ph basis .",
    "this short range behavior is well represented by a hard core of radius @xmath60 and we calculate the two - body wave function @xmath61 by solving the zero - energy two - body schrodinger equation @xmath62 this zero - energy two - body wave function @xmath61 represents the short range behavior of @xmath14 quite well because in the actual experimental bec , the energy of the interacting pair is negligible compared with the depth of the interatomic potential .",
    "thus it is taken as the two - body correlation function in the ph expansion basis .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is adjusted to obtain the expected value of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "we introduce this as a short - range correlation function in the expansion basis .",
    "this also greatly improves the convergence rate of the ph basis and we call it as correlated potential harmonic expansion method ( cphem ) .",
    "this replaces eq(5 ) by @xmath63 and the correlated ph ( cph ) basis is given by @xmath64_{correlated } =   { \\mathcal p}_{2k+l}^{l , m } ( \\omega_{\\mathcal{n}}^{(ij ) } ) \\eta(r_{ij } ) , \\ ] ] the correlated potential matrix @xmath54 is now given by @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the jacobi polynomial , and its norm and weight function are @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively  @xcite .",
    "this is to be noted that the inclusion of @xmath61 makes the ph basis non - orthogonal .",
    "one may surely use the standard procedure for handling non - orthogonal basis .",
    "however in the present calculation we have checked that @xmath61 differs from a constant value only by small amount and the overlap @xmath69 is quite small .",
    "thus we can ignore its derivatives and obtain the eq(12 ) approximately when the correlated potential matrix is calculated by eq(17 ) .",
    "this implies that the effective two - body interaction now becomes @xmath70 .",
    "physically since the interacting atoms of the condensate have very low energy , they do not come close enough to see the actual interatomic interaction . in the zero - energy limit , the scattering cross - section becomes @xmath71 and the effective interaction seen by the atoms is governed by @xmath72 through @xmath61 .",
    "the interatomic potential has been chosen as the van der waals potential with a hard core of radius @xmath73 , viz .",
    ", @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is known for a specific atom and for @xmath79rb atom @xmath80 o.u .",
    "@xcite . in the limit of @xmath81 ,",
    "the potential becomes a hard sphere and the cutoff radius exactly coincides with the @xmath57-wave scattering length @xmath58 . in our choice of two - body potential",
    "we tune @xmath60 to reproduce the experimental scattering length .",
    "as we decrease @xmath60 , @xmath82 decreases and at a particular critical value of @xmath60 it passes through @xmath83 to @xmath84  @xcite . for repulsive",
    "bec , @xmath60 is so chosen that it corresponds to the one - node in the two - body wave function . for our present calculation",
    "we consider @xmath79rb atoms with @xmath58 = @xmath85 o.u . which mimics the jila experiments  @xcite .",
    "we tune @xmath60 to obtain the desired value of @xmath72 and our chosen value of @xmath60 is @xmath86 o.u . with these set of parameters",
    "we solve the coupled differential equation by hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ( haa )  @xcite . in haa",
    ", we assume that the hyperradial motion is slow compared to the hyperangular motion and the potential matrix together with the hypercentrifugal repulsion is diagonalized for a fixed value of @xmath16 .",
    "thus the effective potential for the hyperradial motion is obtained as a parametric function of @xmath16 .",
    "we choose the lowest eigen potential @xmath87 as the effective potential in which the condensate moves collectively .",
    "the energy and wave function of the condensate are finally obtained by solving the adiabatically separated hyperradial equation in the extreme adiabatic approximation ( eaa ) @xmath88\\zeta_{0}(r)=0\\hspace*{.1 cm } , \\label{eaa}\\ ] ] subject to approximate boundary condition on @xmath89 . for our numerical calculation",
    "we fix @xmath90 and truncate the cph basis to a maximum value @xmath91 requiring proper convergence .    to study the thermodynamics of the condensate we need to calculate a large number of energy levels in the effective potential .",
    "the ground state in the effective eigen potential @xmath87 corresponds to the ground state energy @xmath92 of the condensate .",
    "hyperradial excitations for @xmath44=0 in this effective eigen potential @xmath87 corresponds to the breathing mode .",
    "similarly the surface mode excitations with @xmath93 can be calculated as hyperradial excitations in the eigen potential @xmath94 corresponding to different values of @xmath44 . however , for @xmath44 @xmath95 0 , a large inaccuracy is involved in the calculation of off - diagonal potential matrix and numerical computation becomes very slow .",
    "however , the main contribution to the potential matrix comes from the diagonal hypercentrifugal term and we disregard the off - diagonal matrix element for @xmath93 .",
    "thus we get the effective potential @xmath94 in the hyperradial space for @xmath96 by adding the hypercentrifugal term corresponding to a particular value of @xmath44 with the potential matrix element for @xmath90 .",
    "the ground state in this potential is the ground state of the @xmath44th surface mode @xmath97 and @xmath98th radial excitations provide the @xmath99 .",
    "finally we add the center of mass energy @xmath100 to each energy eigen value to obtain the actual energy states .",
    "+ before using the energy spectrum for the calculation of thermodynamic properties , it needs at least some qualitative and quantitative discussion on how good our approximation for the calculation of higher order excitations is .",
    "there are many approximation methods which calculate the low - lying collective excitations and also the higher multipolarities  @xcite .",
    "all these basically use the uncorrelated mean - feld theory and the hydrodynamic ( hd ) model .",
    "it is well known that the excited states at high energy are expected to have single particle nature whereas the low - lying excitations are of collective nature .",
    "however the transition from collective to single - particle excitations for trapped interacting bosons may be systematically affected by the interatomic correlation and finite size effect .",
    "the hd model is good for a large number of bosons in the trap in the thomas - fermi limit and in the spherical trap the eigenfrequencies are calculated using the analytic formula  @xcite @xmath101 here @xmath98 is the radial quantum number and @xmath44 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "@xmath102 corresponds to the surface mode excitation , whereas monopole oscillation @xmath103 corresponds to @xmath104 and @xmath90 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq.hd ] ) has the dependence on the radial nodes and angular momentum but is independent of particle number , whereas in the extreme case of noninteracting harmonic oscillator ( ho ) model @xmath105    thus in general the hd model is expected to be accurate for the low energy excitations of the system and ideal gas is expected to be valid for high excitation energies .",
    "thus our many - body calculation basically connects the two extreme limits .",
    "however it additionally incorporate the effect of finite - size and inter - atomic correlation .",
    "we calculate the frequency of the surface modes and compare with the predictions of hd model . in fig  [ fig.excitation-200 ]",
    "we show the evolution of several excitation frequencies ( @xmath106 in unit of @xmath107 ) for the different modes ( @xmath108 ) as a function of their angular momentum @xmath44 for @xmath109 atoms .",
    "it is mentioned already that the effect of interaction is particularly important for the surface mode @xmath110 . in the same figure",
    "the hydrodynamic predictions is also shown .",
    "it shows that our many - body results first follow the hd curve and then very soon it starts to deviate .",
    "however deviation is larger for @xmath102 and it generally starts to decrease with larger @xmath98 .",
    "another important point is the asymptotic limit when the hd prediction assymptotically goes to zero for large @xmath44 .",
    "the many - body results approach asymptotically the correct non - interacting limit @xmath111 o.u .. a similar observation is also made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the excitation spectrum of @xmath112 @xmath79rb atoms in a spherical trap was calculated using hartree - bogoliubov theory and compared with the hd prediction . for larger particles ( @xmath113 )",
    ", we observe ( fig .",
    "[ fig.excitation-11k ] ) the same qualitative nature , whereas @xmath114 for different surface modes become closer to the hd prediction as expected .    also from fig .",
    "[ fig.excitation-200 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.excitation-11k ] we observe that for larger @xmath44 the frequencies ( @xmath106 ) of different modes of excitations asymptotically approach the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath107 .",
    "it indicates that for the higher excitations , dispersion relation becomes independent of the two - body interaction . in our many - body theory",
    "this can be justified as follows . for the higher excited states ,",
    "the average size of the condensate increases and the atoms tend to be pushed away from each other .",
    "this is also consistent with the findings from the hartree - bogoliubov theory  @xcite where the bogoliubov - type spectrum exhibits states of single - particle nature localized near the surface of the condensate .",
    "surface mode excitations in the bogoliubov - type spectrum can not be of collective nature when its wave length is smaller than the surface thickness @xmath115 .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath44 exceeds a critical value @xmath116",
    "@xcite and the ho model becomes a better approximation for individual excited states with larger @xmath44 values .",
    "however low - lying states are strongly collective , whose many - body effects are properly taken care of by the cphem . for calculation of thermodynamic",
    "quantities , sums over many excited states , in addition to the low - lying ones , are needed .",
    "this masks the effect of single particle nature , as one can see in a typical plot of number of states @xmath117 with energy @xmath118 against @xmath119 in fig .  21 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .      in this section",
    "we will discuss bose - einstein condensation in three dimensional harmonic trap and move on to the anharmonic trap in the next section .",
    "the system of @xmath4 non - interacting bosons is analytically treated in the grand - canonical ensemble and in the thermodynamic limit there will be a phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath0 . in three dimension",
    "the critical temperature @xmath0 is finite and the phase - transition is of first order .",
    "however the bec experiments are also carried out with a finite number of atoms , thus the thermodynamic argument does not apply here . at @xmath120 ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath121 whereas for finite number of particles , @xmath122 and other thermodynamic quantities are smooth function of temperature .",
    "thus the possibility of phase transition is ruled out . therefore one can not define a critical temperature for a system of finite number of bosons .",
    "although there is no phase transition for finite size systems , there is still a macroscopic number of particles in the ground state at low enough temperature .",
    "thus it is convenient to define a transition temperature in the same way as the critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "also at low temperature and in presence of confining potential the interatomic force becomes important even for very dilute atomic cloud .",
    "thus the transition temperature deviates from the critical temperature of ideal gas .",
    "the effect of interaction on the thermodynamic properties of the gas has also been pointed out which signals the breakdown of the bogoliubov theory  @xcite in the calculation of collective excitation .",
    "thus the weakly interacting finite size condensate is of considerable interest .    by using the mean - field approach , based on the popov approximations  @xcite , the temperature dependence of the condensate with repulsive forces is calculated .",
    "it is shown that the first correction to the critical temperature due to finite number of atoms obey  @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mean frequency of a non - isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "mean - field theory also predicts a relative shift in critical temperature due to inter - atomic interaction as  @xcite @xmath125    in this paper we utilize the correlated potential harmonic expansion technique as discussed in sec .",
    "ii . the correlated basis function offers to study the beyond mean - field effect and to calculate various thermodynamic properties more accurately .",
    "as we assume that the inter - atomic correlations beyond two - body can safely be ignored in our picture , it reduces computational difficulty .",
    "we can handle quite few to very large number of atoms by a single technique .",
    "although very recently we have employed this technique to calculate several thermodynamic properties of weakly interacting bose gas , the finite - size effect and deviation due to inter - atomic interaction was not studied  @xcite .",

    "[ fig.tc_n=500 ] we plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath167 .",
    "we observe that @xmath0 increases steadily as the trap becomes more tight .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier calculations for tight traps which were modelled either by pure quartic potential or by power - law potential .",
    "earlier several predictions about the amount of increment of @xmath0 have been made for ibg in different trap geometry  @xcite . here ,",
    "as mentioned above , we are considering interacting bosons in harmonic plus quartic trap which is relevant to the adiabatic cooling .",
    "we observe that even for a small number of bosons @xmath4 in the trap , the transition temperature @xmath0 in the case of anharmonic trap with @xmath171 is almost @xmath172 higher than that of the isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "also the amount of increment increases steadily with the number of bosons @xmath4 in the trap as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig.tc_anh=1.d-4 ] . for @xmath173 in the anharmonic trap with @xmath174 , @xmath0",
    "is found to increase approximately by @xmath175 from that of the isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "thus our study not only supports the possibility of adiabatic formation of bec , we for the first time attempt to predict the amount of increment of @xmath0 in an anharmonic trap .",
    "thus our study reveals that it is also possible to adiabatically cool the system by tuning the intensity of the laser beam used for creating the trap .",
    "next we compute another important thermodynamic quantity - the condensate fraction @xmath176 . in an earlier attempt  @xcite",
    "we have already studied the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction of the interacting bose gas with a finite number of bosons in the isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "we have observed that the main difference of the signature of bec in such finite sized system from the infinite limit lies in the shifted and smeared out onset of macroscopic population of the ground state .",
    "here we are interested in the temperature variation of the ground state occupation in a harmonic plus quartic potential . by inserting the values of the chemical potential @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.mu ] ) we can calculate the ground state population @xmath177 at a particular temperature and for a fixed @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.confrac_anharmonic ] we plot @xmath178 as a function of @xmath20 for different @xmath4 in anharmonic trap with @xmath179 .",
    "we observe that as @xmath4 increases the onset of macroscopic population in the ground state becomes more sudden .",
    "qualitatively this looks very similar to the harmonic trap case .",
    "however the onset of a macroscopic ground state occupation occurs at higher temperature for the anharmonic trap . to illustrate the point further",
    ", we plot the condensate fraction @xmath178 as function of @xmath20 for @xmath167 bosons in harmonic and anharmonic trap with different @xmath2 values in fig .",
    "[ fig.confrac_n=500 ] .",
    "it is seen that at any finite @xmath20 the ground state occupation increases with @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the above discussion as well as earlier theoretical calculations in the quartic trap  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have thoroughly studied several measures of bec like specific heat , critical temperature and condensate fraction in both the isotropic harmonic and the anharmonic trap .",
    "we have precisely determined @xmath0 of the interacting bosons in pure harmonic trap and compared it with the mean - field results .",
    "the detailed study of the finite size correction due to finite number of atoms in the trap and also the correction to @xmath0 due to interaction are two major issues addressed in the present manuscript .",
    "next we extend our correlated many - body method to calculate @xmath0 in the case of quadratic with an additional quartic trap .",
    "the choices of anharmonic trap also satisfies the purpose of adiabatic formation of bec . simply by varying the confining trap it is possible to condense the bose gas at higher @xmath0 which becomes more favourable experimentally . in our theoretical study",
    "the anharmonic trap is modelled as @xmath180 , where @xmath2 is treated as a controllable parameter .",
    "experimentally this can be achieved by tuning the intensity of laser beam .",
    "our study reveals significant increase of @xmath0 for a finite number of interacting bosons with strong anharmonicity .    at present",
    "we are not able to compare our theoretical results with the experimental findings .",
    "however the tuning of @xmath2 parameter basically resemble the experimental situation where the shape of the external trap is changed by tuning the laser intensity .",
    "thus our present theoretical results may provide useful information for future experiments .",
