    "the tegmark cleaned map seems to be compatible with pure cmb simulations at all the concerned scales .",

    "we thus conclude that these cross - correlation signals are most probably caused by foreground residuals because : ( a ) correlations from the q and w bands are more significant than those from the v band , consistent with the frequency dependence nature of foreground ; ( b ) the correlation coefficients from the cmb maps present similar patterns with those from the foreground map , whereas random simulations do not show correlations at the the detected level ; ( c ) the tegmark cleaned map , which has been commonly believed to be cleaner than the _ wmap _ combined map in terms of the foreground removal , shows no significant correlation with the _ egret _ map in the analysis ; and ( d ) the detected cross - correlation coefficient as a function of the galactic latitude appears to be consistent with the co - sec law as an evidence for the galactic origin .",
    "it is possible that these foreground residuals may be induced by cosmic rays , since the galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission is supposedly produced in interactions of cosmic rays with gas and ambient photon fields and thus can be an indicator of cosmic rays in various locations in the galaxy .",
    "the detected foreground residuals can be located in the coefficient map at a certain scale .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to make correlation study with cosmic ray s spatial and spectral distributions in detail . note that the diffuse gamma - ray emission has not been well understood that at energies @xmath22 gev the observed intensity in inner galaxy displays a gev excess at a level of @xmath38 compared with predictions ( hunter _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , which has been interpreted in several models ( strong _ et al . _ 2000 ; de boer 2005 ) .",
