    "modified gravity ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) constitutes an interesting dynamical alternative to @xmath0cdm cosmology in that it is also able to describe with success the current acceleration in the expansion of our universe , the present dark energy epoch .",
    "the specific class of modified @xmath1 gravities ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) has undergone many studies which suggest that this family of gravitational alternatives for dark energy is able to pass the constringent solar system tests . the investigation of cosmic acceleration as well as the study of the cosmological properties of @xmath1 models has been done in refs .",
    "the possibility of a natural unification of early - time inflation with late - time acceleration becomes a realistic and quite natural possibility in such models , as is demonstrated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of modified gravity models of this kind has been reassessed with the appearance of the so - called ` viable ' @xmath1 models @xcite .",
    "those are theories which satisfy both the cosmological as well as the local gravity constraints , which had caused in the past a number of serious problems to some of the first - generation theories , that had to be considered now as only approximate descriptions from more realistic theories .",
    "the final aim of all those phenomenological models is to describe a segment as large as possible of the entire history of our universe , as well as to recover all local predictions of einstein s gravity that have been already verified experimentally , with very good accuracy , at the solar system scale .",
    "it is remarkable that , as was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , some of these realistic models lead to a natural unification of the early - time inflation epoch with the late - time acceleration stage .",
    "let us recall that , in general ( see e.g. @xcite , for a review ) , the total action for the modified @xmath1 gravitational models can be written as [ xxx7 ] s = d^4 x + s_(m ) . here",
    "@xmath2 is a suitable function of the scalar curvature @xmath3 , which defines the modified gravitational part of the model .",
    "the general equation of motion in @xmath4 gravity with matter is given by [ xxx22 ] g _",
    "f(r ) - r _ f(r ) - g _ f(r ) + _ _ f(r ) = - t_(m )  , where @xmath5 is the matter energy - momentum tensor and @xmath6 is the derivative of @xmath1 with respect to its argument @xmath3 . for a generic @xmath1 model",
    "is not easy to find exact static solutions .",
    "however , if one impose some restrictions , one can proceed along the following lines .",
    "first , we may require the existence of solutions with _ constant _ scalar curvature @xmath7 , and we arrive at f(r_0)r_=g_. [ geneqrc ] taking the trace , we have the condition 2f(r_0)=r_0f(r_0 ) [ b ] and this means that the solutions are einstein s spaces , namely they have to satisfy the equation r_=g_= g _ , [ e ] @xmath8 being a solution of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to an effective cosmological constant , namely _ eff==. [ l ] the purpose of our work will be to study the appearance of multiply de sitter space solutions in several realistic models of modified gravity .",
    "the occurrence of multiply de sitter solutions plays a fundamental role in modified gravity because it permits to describe the inflation stage as well as current @xmath0cdm cosmology in terms of this theory alone without any need for either fine - tuning of a cosmological constant nor of introducing extra scalar fields . in summary , this is a minimal and at the same time very powerful approach which circumvents some of the hardest problems of present day physics .",
    "one may argue that these theories are equivalent to introducing extra scalar fields , but this equivalence has been proven to hold at the classical level only , not at the quantum one .",
    "in addition , the cosmological interpretation of modified gravity solutions is different from that of scalar field cosmology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss a viable modified gravity model @xcite in an attempt to study de sitter solutions there .",
    "it is shown that , for some values of the parameters , it is possible to find several de sitter spaces ( as a rule , numerically , for small values of the curvature exponent ) ; one of them may serve for the inflationary stage , while the other one can be used for the description of the dark energy stage .",
    "the evolution of the effective equation of state parameter is investigated numerically .",
    "3 is devoted to the analysis of the same question in a slightly generalized model which is known to describe the unification of the early - time inflation with the late - time acceleration epochs @xcite . the same numerical investigation is carried out , and a multiply de sitter universe solution is constructed . in section 4 , the corresponding problem is investigated for a viable model of tangential modified gravity , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . having in mind the possibility to use a sds universe for the description of cosmic acceleration , those solutions for modified gravity are investigated in sect .",
    "comparison of the free energies of the de sitter and the sds solutions , for the viable model of the second section , is then made .",
    "finally , some outlook is given , together with the conclusions , at the end of the paper .",
    "in this section we will study de sitter solutions in realistic modified gravity models using a dynamical system approach .",
    "we shall start from the following form for the initial action @xmath9 ,   \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is some function of the geometrical invariants . in order to make use of the method of dynamical systems , we work in the metric corresponding to a spatially - flat frw universe , namely @xmath11 from here",

    "@xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 the `` dot '' over the symbol means derivative with respect to time @xmath14 , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the derivative of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in what follows",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the simplest case @xmath19 .",
    "let us consider the following choice for the function @xmath20 @xcite , which represents a very interesting subclass of viable modified gravitational models @xmath21 where the constant @xmath22 has dimension of mass , while @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are some positive dimensionless constants .",
    "note that here @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 , @xmath28 . after making variation ,",
    "it is chosen @xmath29 .",
    "introducing a nonzero constant @xmath25 is here equivalent to introducing a shift in the effective cosmological constant , and for this reason we will assume @xmath30 in our further computations . finally , we can write eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) for the function in ( [ 1.5 ] ) as @xmath31 ,   \\end{array }   \\label{1.6}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as a dynamical system , namely @xmath33 it is easy to see that the critical points of this system are the de sitter points ( @xmath34 ) . to investigate the nature of these points we need to determine them explicitly , a non - trivial problem in the general case .",
    "it is however easy to obtain from ( [ 1.6 ] ) the equation satisfied by the critical points @xmath35 : @xmath36 the same result can be obtained directly starting from equation ( [ b ] ) of the previous section .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath37 , for further investigation of this equation .",
    "so , finally , we have @xmath38 first of all we find one ( trivial ) root of this equation @xmath39 ( it corresponds to @xmath40 ) , what allows us to reduce the order of the equation .",
    "( note also that , if @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ 1.9 ] ) takes a more complicate form and then it does not have the trivial root @xmath39 . ) but nevertheless the equation still is of @xmath42-order and in the interesting case ( @xmath43 ) ; this is too high and the roots can not be found algebraically .",
    "we need a specific discussion of this problem .",
    "it is clear that if there are too many ( say 10 or 20 ) de sitter points in the theory , it looks like a classical analogue ( at a reduced scale , of course ) @xcite of the string landscape vacuum structure in which case it will be far from trivial to obtain the standard cosmology .",
    "nevertheless , something can be done even in this case , by comparing the energies of the corresponding de sitter solutions , which should in fact differ , as is discussed in sect .  v. using descartes rule of signs",
    ", we find that eq .",
    "( [ 1.9 ] ) can have 2 or 0 positive roots .",
    "more detailed information can be obtained by using sturm s theorem .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to apply it in the general case ( for arbitrary @xmath44 ) , so we need to investigate separately each of the different cases , @xmath45 , and see which one is more interesting from a cosmological viewpoint .",
    "we have therefore undertaken here a systematic analysis of all possible cases in this region of values of @xmath44 .",
    "computations are rather involved ( specially for larger @xmath44 ) , but the final results are not so difficult to describe analytically .",
    "we have found , for any of the values of @xmath44 considered , in the range above , that the number of roots depends on the parameter @xmath46 only , and that there is an @xmath47 such that , for @xmath48 , eq .  (",
    "[ 1.9 ] ) has no positive roots , while for @xmath49 , eq .  ( [ 1.9 ] ) has two positive roots .",
    "we here now enumerate our results systematically : @xmath50 ; @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ; @xmath55 ; @xmath56 ; @xmath57 . note also that , near the critical point @xmath47 , both solution are very close to each other when they exist ( a real value of @xmath49 ) , and they are complex conjugate to each other for @xmath48 .",
    "this means that , in a situation where these two roots differ substantially , it must necessarily be @xmath58 .",
    "the ds - points described above can be used for the construction of inflationary or late - time acceleration behavior ( depending on the value of the scale factor @xmath59 ) . to this aim",
    ", the corresponding ds point must be unstable in the inflationary stage but can be either unstable or stable for the late - time acceleration one .",
    "however , this is in fact not a strictly necessary condition , since even for stable ds inflation , the exit from it can be achieved by a coupling with matter , through the effect of small non - local term or by some other mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , an all - round investigation of stability of the ds point turns out to be very difficult in the general case .",
    "for the recent analysis of critical points in more general modified gravity theories depending on all geometrical invariant see ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we can carry out the analysis on the stability of de sitter points for the model we are dealing with in this section , only for some chosen numerical set of parameters .",
    "such computations show that one of the ds points is very likely to be always unstable ( with a smaller value of @xmath60 ) and that another one is very likely to be always stable ( with larger value of @xmath60 ) .",
    "this means that there is actually an easy way for the inflationary stage construction ( if the initial conditions lie sufficiently close to the unstable ds point , see fig .  [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "however , only within the model under consideration it might be a problem with late - time acceleration , originated from the stable point .",
    "the only possibility for late time acceleration is to choose very special parameters , in which the stable point is situated very far away from the unstable one .",
    "of course , the problem disappears when one describes only late - time acceleration within such a model , or when one takes into account other terms like the local ones .",
    "note however that specific values of the parameters in which both points are unstable can be chosen too , which give rise to a sound theory which provides a unified description of the inflationary and late - time acceleration epochs .    ) near the equilibrium points .",

    "first , note that a full numerical investigation starting from the inflation ( or from our ds point ) and extending to the late - time acceleration epoch and going through a frw - like stage is not feasible because of the presence of numerical instabilities that prevent such possibility .",
    "for this reason , we will investigate the regions near the equilibrium points only , and especially near the unstable one . in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] the trajectories in the phase plane ( @xmath61 ) are presented for the set of parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "such small values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are motivated in @xcite , but the picture is typical in any case .",
    "the position of the ds point is specified .",
    "we may see one stable point ( with bigger value of @xmath60 ) and another , unstable one .",
    "the stars in the graph correspond to the beginning of the trajectories .",
    "we see clearly that trajectories can pass sufficiently close to the ds point , and that they escape from it , lead by the two attractors .",
    "one of them ( the upper one ) leads to a singularity , while another one ( heading towards the bottom ) , leads to a solution going somewhere in the frw - like region ( this is difficult to analyze exactly , due to numerical instabilities ) . in fig .",

    "[ fig.1 ] ( both of them lead to the bottom in fig .",

    "we see that there actually are trajectories which start from phantom - like solutions and tend to a normal evolution ( when this is possible in the model ) . of course , these are qualitative considerations only , owing to the fact that no matter is taken into account .",
    "most probably , inclusion of matter will change the situation .",
    "however , it is just remarkable that both the early - time inflation epoch as well as the late - time accelerating one could be obtained in a unified and natural way in such a model , owing to the presence of several ds points .",

    "let us require that @xmath74 be a solution of eq .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "this is possible only if there is some relation among the constants of our theory . as we can easily see from ( [ 2.3 ] ) , it must be that @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath76 , we need that @xmath77 . substituting this condition into ( [ 2.3 ] ) we find an essential simplification of the former equation , namely @xmath78 where the root @xmath74 is already excluded .",
    "we now discuss the physical meaning of finding a solution @xmath74 . as a rule",
    "this will imply that @xmath8 is the value of the scalar curvature at present time , but in principle @xmath8 is just a parameter of the theory , which could be given any likely value .",
    "we can , for instance , fix @xmath8 to have the ds point value which is situated exactly at present time , @xmath79 , or at @xmath80 years .",

    "we find several positive roots ( which correspond to ds points in the past ) and a number of negative roots ( needless to say , only values which are @xmath81 have a physical meaning ) , corresponding to ds points in the future .",
    "unfortunately , computations are harder than in the previous case and our calculations have been performed for three specific values of the parameter @xmath82 : 3 , 5 and 7 , only . in any case , the results are very similar for the three situations , what gives us hope that for larger values of @xmath82 result will be also similar .",
    "we may predict the upper limit of the ds points in the future only , which is 2 , but in any case this point is not much interesting .    concerning the ds points in the past",
    ", the picture turns out to be much like the one in the previous case : the number of ds points depends only on a dimensionless parameter for all investigated values of @xmath82 .",
    "that is , @xmath83 . and",
    "there are two values , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which are different for each @xmath82 , so for @xmath86 and @xmath87 there are two ds points and for @xmath88 there is no ds point .",

    "as we can see , the interval where there are no ds points shrinks when the value of the parameter @xmath82 is increased .",
    "if we assume that for larger @xmath82 the number of ds points depends on the parameter @xmath101 only  as clearly happens in the investigated cases  we do find @xmath84 and @xmath85 for any value of @xmath82 .",
    "such investigations show that @xmath84 and @xmath85 slowly change when @xmath82 increases and that the interval without ds points is present even for very big value of the parameter @xmath82 .",
    "for example , for @xmath102 we have @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a simple numerical investigation of stability for the existing ds points shows that one of them ( the one with the smaller value of @xmath60 ) is always unstable , but the other one ( with the larger value of @xmath60 ) can either be stable or unstable . from our numerical results ,",
    "the appearance of unstable ds points pairs relative to the interval @xmath86 seems most probable .",
    "note also that the condition @xmath76 means that it actually must be @xmath105 and that in this case it is most likely the one stable and one unstable point show up .",
    "now let us consider the evolution equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) from a different point of view .",
    "as we already noted , @xmath8 is a parameter of the theory which corresponds to the value of the scalar curvature at some epoch .",
    "this means that during the normal evolution of our universe , from large to little ( or zero ) curvature , it becomes @xmath7 at some moment .",
    "but , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) , this means that that at this point the coefficient of the higher derivative term ( @xmath106 ) is equal to zero .",
    "this is a well - known mathematical problem , which needs special investigation . as we know from mathematics there are two possibilities : the solution of the perturbed equation ( with a higher derivative term ) may tend to the solution of the degenerate equation ( without higher derivatives ) , and then the coefficient of the higher derivative term may tend to zero or not tend to the solution of the degenerate equation .",
    "a special investigation of this problem shows that solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) tend to solutions of the degenerate equation , which is @xmath107 when @xmath108 but not so when @xmath109 .",
    "this means that the point @xmath8 is reachable during the evolution from large @xmath3 to zero , but it is not the final point of the evolution , because there is an instability in the future . on the other hand",
    ", we have @xmath7 at this point , and therefore @xmath110 . substituting this into ( [ 2.5 ] ) we find a relation among the parameters of the theory which were introduced before , @xmath75 .",
    "this means that , generically , if one wants the point @xmath8 to be reachable during evolution , a relation of this sort among the parameters of the theory must be fulfilled .",
    "that is , we have two independent parameters only ( or even just one if we consider that @xmath8 is strictly related to our epoch ) . note also that it is impossible to use standard numerical methods near this point for solving eq .",

    ".    in summary",
    ", we have investigated in this paper several viable models of modified gravity which satisfy both the constraints of local as well as cosmological tests . by means of a numerical study",
    ", it is demonstrated that some versions of highly non - linear models exhibit multiply de sitter universe solutions which often appear in pairs , being one of them stable and the other unstable .",
    "the numerical evolution of the effective equation of state parameter is presented too . as a result",
    ", these models can be considered as natural candidates for the unification of early - time inflation with late - time acceleration through ds critical points .",
    "moreover , based on the de sitter solutions , multiply sds solutions can also be constructed .",
    "further , we have investigated the thermodynamic properties of these sds universes : their corresponding entropies and free energies have been calculated and compared .",
    "sds universe might also appear at the ( pre-)inflationary stage .",
    "owing to the highly non - linear structure of the theories under discussion , the ds universes had to be constructed with numerical tools mainly .",
    "moreover , in order to simplify the problem , at this first stage of the investigation we did not to consider matter contributions .",
    "it is clear that , in the next step , we must necessarily include matter and reconsider the problem in its presence .",
    "this has the potential to lead to a sufficiently realistic quantitative description of the universe expansion history , in which modified gravity would be responsible for both acceleration stages : the inflation epoch and the dark energy one .",
