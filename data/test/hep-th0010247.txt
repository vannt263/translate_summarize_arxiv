    "it has been suggested by sen  @xcite that the energy gap between unstable d - brane configurations and the stable vacuum should be computable using witten s cubic string field theory ( sft )  @xcite",
    ". the level truncation scheme of  @xcite has appeared to lead to very good agreement with the expected results in the context of the decay of bosonic d - branes  @xcite and unstable d - branes in superstring field theory  @xcite .",
    "lower dimensional d - branes have been constructed as tachyonic lump configurations on bosonic d25-brane  @xcite .",
    "support for sen s conjecture that lower dimensional d - branes can be identified with tachyonic lump solution of string field theory on bosonic d25-brane also has come from the noncommutative limit of the effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "various toy models of tachyon dynamics have been useful tool for understanding the realization of sen s conjectures  @xcite .    despite the success of cubic sft in leading to very good agreement with the expected results , it is still not clear why the calculations in the level - truncated string field theory converge so rapidly to the correct answer for quantities like vacuum energy .",
    "it is also not clear how to study the nonperturbative vacuum using this approach .",
    "an alternative method has been suggested in  @xcite which says that renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of worldsheet theory in first quantized approach can be used to show that the mass of the tachyon lump on a dp - brane is equal to that of a d(p1)-brane .",
    "this leads to the idea that boundary string field theory ( sft ) as was originally proposed by witten and shatashvili  @xcite may efficiently describe open string tachyon condensation on d - branes in bosonic string theory  @xcite ( also see  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out in  @xcite that boundary sft can provide an exact verification of sen s conjectures .",
    "based on  @xcite , one can compute the action exactly taking a simplest tachyon profile as boundary operator of ghost number zero which is quadratic in the space - time coordinate .",
    "one can also describe the lumps corresponding to the lower dimensional d - branes and calculate their tension that agrees with the expected result exactly .",
    "one strong point of the results of  @xcite using level truncation scheme in cubic sft is that it gives a definite picture of the tachyon profile as superposition of @xmath2 for different @xmath3 with definite coefficients producing soliton of finite width . on the other hand the boundary sft analysis of  @xcite",
    "does not say how the higher tachyon harmonics get mixed with the cosines of different @xmath3 to produce finite size soliton profile .",
    "the reason for this is that the mass parameter flows to infinity in the ir in their particular choice of coordinates starting with the simple choice of the tachyon profile initially .",
    "this is because the rg equations in that particular choice of coordinates become linear in coupling constants . since the width of the soliton",
    "is given by inverse of the mass parameter which flows to infinity in the exact description , the width is zero .",
    "also it is difficult to see in this setup how the theory at ir fixed point can describe configurations of more than one d - brane .",
    "we should note that although the theory flows to infinity in the ir , the zamolodchikov metric on the space of worldsheet theories measures the distance between the uv and ir fixed point to be finite .    in this paper we will try to address these issues in the worldsheet approach by choosing the initial tachyon profile on a circle on bosonic d25-brane world - volume .",
    "the basic setup is similar to  @xcite .",
    "the choice of boundary perturbation , as we will discuss in the next section , is motivated from the analysis of  @xcite . in our choice of coordinates in the space of worldsheet field theories",
    "the rg analysis provides the boundary conformal field theory to flow to a nearby ir fixed point .",
    "we will consider only the first three tachyon modes .",
    "the values they flow to after rg flow appears to be in good agreement with the values computed in  @xcite of tachyon modes of the string field at the stationary point of the potential .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the worldsheet rg scheme in the context of boundary sft .",
    "we comment on the boundary entropy that measures the corresponding d - brane tension describing the boundary cft .",
    "we highlight the basic setup of  @xcite that leads to a particular choice of the tachyon profile .    in section 3",
    "we perform the rg analysis in detail choosing a particular ansatz for the green s function of fast moving modes of the scalar field .",
    "the rg equations are obtained up to third order in coupling constants .",
    "the easy but tedious parts of the calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "in section 4 we plot the lump profile that appears from the rg analysis of the previous section . following the method of affleck and ludwig  @xcite we calculate the boundary entropy in the leading order .",
    "our result satisfies the @xmath4-theorem of  @xcite .",
    "the boundary entropy is calculated to an accuracy of about @xmath0 of the exact result .",
    "in section 5 we analyse the multicritical behaviour of the potential in the ir and argue that the theory in the ir is that of a configuration of two d24-branes .",
    "we make an analogy with the kondo problem and argue that the process of the formation of the lump due to tachyon condensation corresponds to the underscreened kondo effect .",
    "exact screening occurs when the theory on the brane rolls down to the nonperturbative closed string vacuum .",
    "overscreening , on the other hand leads to a picture similar to dielectric effect .",
    "we comment on @xmath1 symmetry restoration .",
    "section 6 contains discussions on further related issues that are beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "if the spectrum of a point in the moduli space has relevant operators in the ir , the point is said to be unstable .",
    "the unstable point then might be discarded from the moduli space . in other words , this results in the appearance of unstable directions in the effective potential .",
    "ir instability indicates that we are in a _ false _ vacuum",
    ". the obvious question will be which point ( or vacuum ) will replace this unstable point , or in other words , how to resolve the ir instability",
    ".    often regions in moduli space contain d - brane configurations related by t - duality .",
    "the above issue can be addressed in these sectors by adding some ir relevant boundary perturbations .",
    "one important feature of this boundary deformation is that the bulk theory always remain conformal .",
    "flows caused by a relevant boundary operator appear as open string tachyon condensation .",
    "flowing to ir on the worldsheet is equivalent to approaching a classical solution of spacetime theory .    as a result of the flow , at some points in moduli space ,",
    "boundary conditions are changed from neumann to dirichlet .",
    "the reverse process indicates nonunitarity .",
    "the direction of the flow is determined by _ boundary entropy _ defined by  @xcite    g_a = 0|a , the disk partition function of the boundary state @xmath5 associated to the perturbed theory .",
    "the phases of @xmath6 and @xmath5 can be chosen such that the above quantity is real and positive for any boundary state .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite in first order in conformal perturbation theory that boundary entropy , @xmath4 decreases along rg flows , suggesting the so called @xmath4-_theorem _ similar to zamolodchikov s @xmath7-theorem  @xcite . in this context , the case of sine - gordon boundary perturbation with single frequency is studied in  @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath4 measures the tension of the d - brane that describes boundary conformal field theory at the corresponding fixed point  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and the @xmath4-theorem implies the minimization of the action in the space of _ all two - dimensioanal worldsheet field theories_. the worldsheet formulation of string field theory is _ manifestly _ background independent depends on the closed string background . ] . in  @xcite a gauge invariant background independent spacetime string field theory action is defined as the solution of the following equation :    = _ 0 ^ 2_0 ^ 2  _",

    "the correlation function in the above expression is defined in terms of the perturbed worldsheet action on the disk .",
    "the above action is defined up to an additive constant . although the boundary perturbation @xmath12 does not depend on ghosts , the theory with perturbed action",
    "is not renormalizable .",
    "but in the case of tachyon condensation , it is renormalizable .",
    "so boundary string field theory works well for studying tachyon condensation problem .",
    "but it is not clear how to define a general off - shell amplitude due to uv divergences on the worldsheet .",
    "an alternative definition of s is given by the metric on the space of worldsheet theories  @xcite    = -^jg_ij , [ s - g ] where @xmath16 is the corresponding beta function which acts like a vector field on the space of worldsheet theories .",
    "in  @xcite a very important relation between the action @xmath17 and the partition function on the disk is demonstrated up to second order in coupling constant :    _ = -^i+z ( ) .",
    "[ s - z ] since on - shell the beta function vanishes , the action is same as the partition function .",
    "this fixes the additive ambiguity in  ( [ seqn ] ) .",
    "the above relation implies that all symmetries of the worldsheet partition partition function are also symmetries of the spacetime action .",
    "it is further argued that  @xcite the spacetime action @xmath17 is nothing but the boundary entropy @xmath4 .",
    "although background independence is manifest in the worldsheet formalism , it is lost once we compute @xmath17 or @xmath4 perturbatively .",
    "but if the above relation between the spacetime action and the partition function is true in all orders in coupling constant , it is not lost .    on the other hand ,",
    "the chern - simons string field theory is not manifestly background independent . to achieve this one",
    "is forced to work in a truncated version of hilbert space of the first quantized theory restricting the string field to a background independent subspace for studying the classical lump solution . in our renormalization group analysis of the problem of formation of the tachyonic lump ,",
    "we follow the basic setup of  @xcite where the @xmath18 coordinate is taken to be on a circle of radius @xmath19 . we take @xmath20 to be the scalar field on the string worldsheet associated with @xmath18 . on a d25-brane @xmath20",
    "satisfies neumann boundary conditions . the conformal field theory associated with the field",
    "@xmath20 has central charge , @xmath21 .    before going into the rg analysis",
    "let us briefly discuss the setup of  @xcite",
    ". for details on the background independent subspace of the complete fock space see  @xcite . a basis of states of this theory is conveniently formed by grouping the states into verma modules .",
    "the states contained in the verma module are obtained out of primary state @xmath22 by acting with the associated virasoro generators @xmath23 .",
    "linear independence of the states to form the basis is achieved by removing null states from the spectrum .",
    "in fact the spectrum is free of null states for @xmath24 and an irrational @xmath19 value . in order to achieve a successful truncation of the hilbert space one has to restrict the primary states of the boundary conformal field theory along @xmath18 to be even under @xmath25 and to be trivial primaries of the conformal field theory of the fields associated to the rest of the coordinates of bosonic string theory . as a result",
    "the appropriate primary states are : ( 1 ) the zero momentum primaries that are even under @xmath25 ( also removing the null states ) , and ( 2 ) the vacuum state @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "let us recall that an open bosonic string propagating in the tachyon background is described by the following action    s = dsdt  ^ab_a__b^+_-^ dk  t(k ) e^ik , where @xmath28 is the uv cutoff and @xmath29 is the tachyon field with momentum @xmath30 . in the present case where @xmath18 is compact , the momentum is descrete and we are motivated to take the boundary perturbation to be of the form ( respecting @xmath25 symmetry ) :    dt  t[(t)]=_n=0^_ndt  ( ( 0,t ) ) , where @xmath31s are tachyon modes .",
    "the zero mode @xmath32 is the identity operator and is always tachyonic .",
    "the higher modes may not be tachyonic depending on the radius @xmath19 . in our analysis",
    "we only consider the first three tachyon modes ( _ i.e. _ @xmath33 ) .",
    "hence the problem is similar to the boundary sine - gordon model with two frequencies , which typically allows to hit a nearby ir fixed point producing a lump profile of finite size .",
    "the boundary conformal field theory can be described by a gaussian model with gapless excitation spectrum and the correlation functions of bosonic exponents follow power laws .",
    "this behaviour implies that the correlation length is infinite and the system is in its critical phase . under boundary perturbations ,",
    "usually the correlation functions are affected differently on different scales and the long distance asymptotics get affected the most .",
    "certain perturbations may cause only tiny changes in the uv , but changes the ir behaviour profoundly . in the rg picture",
    "this is observed as a growth of the coupling constant associated with the perturbation .",
    "a slow decay of correlation functions gives rise to divergences in the perturbation series .",
    "if the influence of the perturbing operator grows on large scales , the perturbation is _ relevant_. consider the perturbed action    s = s_0 + dt o_(t ) where @xmath34 is the action of the system at criticality and @xmath35 is the perturbing field with scaling dimension @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",

    "the above action describes a renormalization group flow from a theory where all 26 bosonic directions are neumann describing a d25-brane to the theory where @xmath18 direction is dirichlet describing a d24-brane .",
    "instead of using the callan - symanzik formalism we follow the wilsonian renormalization scheme where we put the theory on a lattice .",
    "we assume that the fourier transform of the field , @xmath43 , is defined in the brillouin zone and choose a cut - off , @xmath44 .",
    "the aim is to start moving towards larger distances ( or lower energies ) by integrating out the fields with shorter and shorter wavelengths .",
    "the procedure is based on the decomposition of the boundary field with a cutoff into a slow moving ( long - wavelength ) and a fast moving ( short - moving ) component , @xmath45 , where we have split the brillouin zone @xmath44 into a wide region @xmath46 and a narrow slice @xmath47 .",

    "if the model is renormalizable , which is known to be the case for sine - gordon model that we will consider below , the effective action will have the same structure as the original one , but with a new set of coupling constants .",

    "the idea is to represent the @xmath209 species of electrons in terms of three independent bosonic fields : a free scalar carrying @xmath210 charge , a @xmath211 wzw non - linear @xmath212-model field carring @xmath213 spin , and a @xmath214 wzw field carring @xmath215 flavour degrees of freedom .",
    "the kondo interaction involves only the spin current .",
    "the degrees of freedom at the ir fixed point are described by an @xmath216 kac - moody invariant cft .",
    "both boundary scaling dimensions and fermi - liquid bulk scaling dimensions are described by a @xmath217 kac - moody boundary cft .",
    "there are restrictions on the combinations of charge , spin , flavour degrees of freedom .",
    "unlike the underscreened case , here fermion exponents are not recovered and are generally not half - integer .",
    "they come from more general combinations of three types of bosonic fields .",
    "the fermion exponents are sums of @xmath210 , @xmath214 and @xmath211 kac - moody current algebra exponents .",
    "they are not free and in fact _ bound _ together in combinations to form fermion composites .",
    "the analogue of overscreened kondo physics in string theory is the case when one considers string theory on the @xmath213 group manifold that can be described by a world - sheet wzw action and d - branes are stabilized against shrinking by quantized @xmath210 flux as discussed by bachas , douglas and schweigert  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "they considered a static d2-brane wrapping an @xmath218 parametrized by @xmath219 breaking @xmath220 to the diagonal @xmath221 . with non - zero background @xmath222 field",
    "the gauge invariant quantity is @xmath223 .",
    "if @xmath224 , where @xmath3 is the magnetic monopole number appearing due to the world - volume flux quantization @xmath225 , the d2 brane is prevented from shrinking to one of the poles of @xmath226  @xcite . inside this range",
    "the energy of the system has a unique minimum away from the poles of @xmath226 . in the large-@xmath30",
    "limit , that minimum energy reduces to the mass of @xmath3 d - particles .",
    "the stable configuration leads in the dual picture to a bound state of @xmath3 d - particles on @xmath218 similar to the case described in  @xcite .    from the above physical picture ( of the underscreening and exact screening kondo effect ) one can try to see the mechanism of generation of local @xmath194 chan - paton factors of @xmath186 coincident d24-branes as a result of breaking of inherent stringy @xmath162 symmetry due to fusion of boundary spin or dynamical degrees of freedom with internal symmetry . the local operator @xmath227 near the ir fixed point breaks @xmath162 down to @xmath228 in the core of the soliton .",
    "while there is a local @xmath194 on @xmath186 coincident d24-branes , @xmath229 is again swallowed up by the internal symmetry of the system .",
    "as @xmath230 ( the exact screening case ) , the situation is similar to perturbation by the tachyon zero mode only , which leads the theory to the nonperturbative closed string vacuum and the local @xmath210 symmetry on the d25-brane is restored to the full @xmath162 symmetry . for @xmath231 ( when perturbations with all @xmath232s are triggered )",
    "we get full @xmath162 symmetry corresponding to infinite number of d24-branes in the core of the soliton .",
    "symmetry restoration in the same context for noncommutative tachyon solitons is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it can also be seen whether the operator @xmath227 can give rise to @xmath233 copies of identity operator at ir fixed point , which are basically @xmath233 generators of @xmath194 as all operators flow to identity operators or derivative of identity operators at ir fixed point .",
    "so from the multicritical behaviour discussed above , four copies of the identity operator are left , indicating the final configuration to be that of two d24-branes .",
    "there are many unexplored questions related to the material covered in this paper .",
    "we mention some of them below along with some remarks .    it would be interesting to understand the precise relationship between boundary string field theory and chern - simons string field theory .",
    "in other words , how the action in boundary sft is related to the chern - simons action in cubic sft . it is pointed out in  @xcite that the boundary sft action described in certain coordinates on the space of coupling constants must be related to the cubic action described in a particular choice of coordinates on the space of string fields .",
    "the two choices of coordinates are related by some complicated singular transformation . in  @xcite the boundary conformal field theory",
    "is perturbed by a simple tachyon profile with mass parameter @xmath234 that flows from zero in the uv to infinity in the ir .",
    "the lump profile has width @xmath235 which vanishes in the ir .",
    "in contrast , the level truncation scheme in cubic sft gives solitons with finite width .    on the other hand , in our scheme one",
    "gets the soliton profile with finite width situated in a nearby ir fixed point .",
    "the set of values the first three tachyon harmonics evolve to in order to hit the desired ir fixed point is very close to the one obtained in the level truncation scheme in cubic sft  @xcite .",
    "also the perturbative result of the boundary entropy is in good agreement with the exact result",
    ". it might be more appropriate to choose the signs of all the couplings initially to be the same or by a symmetry to be of the same sign for the zero and second modes and of opposite sign for the first mode .",
    "the former choice does not make the analysis different - we have already mentioned that the zero mode is the identity operator which appears in the rg equations only in linear order and does not contribute to the boundary entropy ( which is the only physical quantity of interest here ) .",
    "the latter choice ( that involves opposite signs for first and second modes ) makes the calculation of the boundary entropy more complicated and it does not fit in well with the setup used in  @xcite . while the relationship between the our setup and the chern - simons sft is not clear , finding the reason for this ( apparent ) agreement of our result with that of  @xcite is left for future work .",
    "there is a striking similarity between the beta function equations  ( [ betafn2 ] ) in the first quantized theory and the string field equations of motion given below ( in the notation of  @xcite ) :    2 & = & 2t_0 - 2k^3t_0 ^ 2-k^3-t_1 ^ 2-k^3-t_2 ^ 2= 0 , + 2 & = & -(1-)t_1 + 2k^3-t_0t_1 + k^3-t_1t_2=0 , + 2 & = & -(1-)t_2 + 2k^3-t_0t_2 + k^3-t_1 ^ 2 = 0 , [ sfteqn ] where @xmath236 is the inverse of the mapping radius of the punctured disks defining the three string vertex .",
    "it is maximal for the vertex of the cubic potential  @xcite .",
    "the main difference is in the zero mode dependence . in the rg case",
    "the identity operator adds a constant to the action . in the rg equation",
    "the corresponding coupling constant appears in the universal linear order only .",
    "presumably there are definite complicated nonlinear relations between the different tachyon harmonics generating term proportional to @xmath237 and the cross terms @xmath238 , @xmath239 in rg equations . on the other hand since @xmath240 is dimensionless , the mapping radius @xmath241 should be somehow related to the cut - off @xmath242 in boundary conformal field theory side .    in order to get a concrete relationship between our analysis with cubic string field theory",
    "we do need to develop a concrete proposal for how we can define an off - shell string field theory using our variables ; this requires choosing an appropriate uv regulator that makes the equations of motion for all the coupling constants unambiguous and free of divergence .",
    "once this is done , one can then interprete the fixed points that we have found as ( approximate ) solutions of the equations of motion of this specific string field theory . in the absence of such a field theory",
    "it is not clear what these solutions correspond to .",
    "these are of course the rg fixed points in a specific renormalization scheme , but this is a first quantized viewpoint as opposed to a second quantized one .",
    "cubic sft clearly provides such a formulation - the equations of motion involving arbitrarily high level fields do not suffer from uv divergence .",
    "the background independent sft does not provide such a formulation for all fields , but can be solved exactly for a special class of configurations ( corresponding to operators quadratic in @xmath243 ) and hence we can consider a subsector of the theory where only these operators are switched on . in this way it avoids having to do with non - renormalizable field theories . in your formulation",
    "we have switched a finite subset of the operators in an approximation scheme , but this in higher order would induce operators of arbitrarily high dimensions and so one needs to understand how to deal with non - renormalizable field theories .",
    "one way to avoid this might be to use the techniques of integrable perturbations developed by ghoshal and zamolodchikov  @xcite .",
    "we have not raised issues concerning the shape and size of the lump representing the lower dimensional d - brane . as was pointed out in  @xcite , in order to get some insight into this issue one needs to find the energy density of the object . since cubic sft is nonlocal ,",
    "it is presently not clear how to address this .",
    "also the size might be an artifact of the particular gauge chosen .",
    "the shape and size depends on a particular definition of off - shell string field , and can vary from one sft to another .",
    "the important fact is that in chern - simons sft everything is smooth and non - singular , so it gives a good definition of the off - shell string field .",
    "there is no invariant definition of size of the d - brane unless one looks at the coupling to metric or some closed string background .",
    "presumably one needs to follow the analysis analogous to the bulk conformal perturbation theory in the presence of a fluctuating metric ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is pointed out in  @xcite that the dynamics of the metric makes sense only when there is a scale in the path integral , for example by fixing the area .",
    "this is done by the so - called _ gravitational dressing _ of the microscopic matter operator by the appropriate liouville dependence and inserting it in the path integral .",
    "an analogous treatment in boundary perturbation theory might give some useful insight regarding the shape and size of the d - brane .",
    "an other important issue is to extend the scheme used in this paper to superstring theories where lower dimensional d - branes are identified with a tachyonic kink solution rather than a lump solution . in the supersymmetric setup it is more convenient and sensible to study a configuration of parallel d - branes .",
    "also the size and shape of the d - branes in the ir can be investigated considering physical picture involving closed string scattering off the d - branes  @xcite .",
    "it would also be of interest to study intersecting d - brane configurations using the boundary rg analysis discussed in this paper .",
