    "drag reducing flow control is a topic of great interest due to its practical significance for engineering application in different high - speed transport systems such as airplanes , marine vessels or pipelines .",
    "a broad variety of control methods aiming at the reduction of skin friction drag in turbulent wall bounded flows has been introduced in the past .",
    "classical active control schemes such as opposition control @xcite , suboptimal and optimal control techniques @xcite , various wall movements @xcite and direct damping of near - wall fluctuations @xcite have been thoroughly investigated during the last 20 years .",
    "these control schemes are often investigated using direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of fully developed turbulent channel flow ( tcf ) assuming periodic boundary conditions in stream- and spanwise directions with control activated on the entire area of both channel walls .",
    "although the tcf configuration has been a longstanding proven tool for the evaluation of control effects on the flow field , the global effect of locally applied control in a developing boundary layer is of major interest for the potential application of flow control in practice .",
    "this point is highlighted by @xcite who present an analytic estimation of the drag reducing effect due to laminarization near the leading edge of a tbl .",
    "they draw attention to the fact that local and global control effects need to be distinguished when a tbl is locally altered .",
    "recently , several studies , in which different control strategies are analyzed in tbl , have been presented . in principle drag reduction in tbl can be achieved not only through the suppression of reynolds shear stress , which is the typical strategy in tcf , but also by application of other control methods . for example , the introduction of wall - normal mass flux is another drag reducing option @xcite , which is thoroughly discussed based on dns results in @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "present a comparison of opposition control that aims at the suppression of the reynolds shear stress in tcf and tbl and show that in spite of the very similar drag reduction rates that are achieved in both flows , the underlying drag reduction mechanisms are quite different .",
    "transient effects in tbl have sometimes been reported in literature . however , the main focus of these publications is not on the streamwise development of the tbl after the control and the corresponding computational domains are rather short so that the reported results are limited to a narrow region right after the control .",
    "@xcite conducted a dns of tbl with local uniform blowing and suction and report a rapid decrease of the skin friction coefficient in the blowing region and a strong increase further downstream leading to negative local drag reduction rates .",
    "similar results are reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite present large eddy simulation data comparing locally applied uniform blowing , opposition control and blowing - only opposition control techniques .",
    "downstream of the control they observe local drag increase for the blowing strategies and drag reduction for classical opposition control over a short region before the uncontrolled state is recovered .",
    "oscillating wall control in tbl is discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former study analyzes the transient behavior at the beginning of the control region and the latter reports a reduction of the local skin friction drag downstream of the control area . considering that a local flow state in spatially developing flow is generally determined as a result of the upstream events , it is possible that a local control affects the flow state far downstream of the control region .",
    "this is an important aspect for potential practical applications , where the realization of a control technique on the entire wall might not be feasible , so that global drag reduction has to be achieved with a limited control area size .    in the present work we focus on the downstream development of a tbl and",
    "the resultant wall friction after control has been applied locally .",
    "this is achieved through dns of tbl with sufficiently large streamwise domain length after a controlled region . in the control region ,",
    "drag reduction is achieved by either applying uniform blowing or by damping near - wall turbulence .",
    "the latter is a simplified representation of all classical tcf control techniques that lead to a suppression of the reynolds shear stress .",
    "both control schemes are adjusted such that similar drag reduction rates are realized in the control region . however , the downstream development of friction drag is quite different depending on the type of control applied .",
    "we propose the definition of a global drag reduction rate for tbl that is based on the overall drag acting on a plate of finite length and show that this quantity is strongly influenced by the drag properties downstream of the control region . while the drag reduction achieved in the control region is specific to the applied control strategy , the streamwise development of friction drag far downstream of the control region",
    "can generally be explained by the von krmn integral momentum equation .",
    "based on this knowledge we propose a simple model for the drag estimation far downstream of the control region .",

    "the convection and viscous terms are discretized using a 3rd order runge - kutta and crank - nicolson methods , respectively .",

    "the effect is also visible over a certain extent downstream of the control region , where a re - transition of the flow occurs .",

    "the corresponding local drag reduction rate is depicted in figure  [ fig : r_rint](b ) .",
    "both schemes cause significant modification of the skin friction coefficient resulting in local drag reduction rates with maximum values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . for body force damping , drag reduction increases gradually inside the control region ( @xmath67 ) and approaches the maximum of @xmath68 at the end of the control region .",
    "downstream of the controlled region , @xmath69 first decays , reaches a negative peak , and then gradually converges to zero .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite . for uniform",
    "blowing , @xmath69 starts to increase upstream of the control region already .",
    "it peaks at @xmath70 , decreases inside the control region and rises back to @xmath66 at the end of the control region .",
    "this local decrease of @xmath69 inside the control region is also found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a positive @xmath69 remains downstream of the control region , which gradually decays towards zero .",
    "this downstream behavior is in a good agreement with the results reported by @xcite , but it differs from the data presented in @xcite and @xcite where negative @xmath69 is reported downstream of the blowing section .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be solved through a simple parameter variation , which reveals that the downstream behavior directly after the control section strongly depends on the control configuration .",
    "results of such a parameter variation are shown in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "it is found that a shorter control region with the same blowing amplitude causes a local negative @xmath69 directly after the control .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations of @xcite and @xcite , where only a short region after the control is employed due to a limited streamwise domain size .",
    "the larger domain size in the present dns reveals that - also in these cases - @xmath69 assumes positive values far downstream of the control region .",
    "persistent drag reduction far downstream of the control is therefore a characteristic property of uniform blowing .",
    "the evolution of @xmath69 downstream of the control region significantly influences the integral turbulent skin friction drag and the global turbulent drag reduction rate when a longer section of the flat plate after the control region is taken into consideration .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath71_x = [ c_{f,0}]_x - [ c_{f}]_x$ ] and @xmath72 are shown in figure  [ fig : r_rint](c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the control schemes were set up to yield a similar global behavior within the control region , which is reflected in the figures .",

    "continuously increases downstream of the control while body force damping produces a peak of @xmath71_x$ ] around @xmath74 before it decreases continuously . in terms of @xmath72",
    "it can be seen that for the present case body force damping will outperform uniform blowing if a plate up to a total length of @xmath75 is considered . for a longer plate , uniform blowing yields better global behavior .",
    "it should be emphasized that the global drag reduction rate up to @xmath76 achieved by uniform blowing is @xmath77 larger than that by body force damping , although they yield very similar drag reduction rate within the control region .",
    "this is solely caused by the different behavior downstream of the control region .    for drag reducing control in tcf the formulation of additional control indices related to net energy savings or energy efficiency of the applied control @xcite",
    "is widely established .",
    "this evaluation is based on the fact that any active control requires a certain power input to run the control .",
    "this continuously inserted control power has to be smaller than the reduction in pumping power due to drag reduction in a tcf in order to enable net energy savings .",
    "for tbl the dimensionless power saving obtained by the global drag reduction is given by @xmath78_{x}$ ] shown in figure  [ fig : r_rint](c ) multiplied with the free - stream velocity @xmath1 , which is unity .",
    "an estimation of the control power input for uniform blowing requires the consideration of the pressure difference between the plenum from which the injected mass is supplied and the flow . for an idealized case in which this pressure difference is neglected",
    ", the power that the control inserts into the fluid is very small @xcite . in case of body force damping , the local power input due to the applied body force is given by the product of body force @xmath79 ( as given by equation  ) and wall normal velocity fluctuation .",
    "since the body force is designed to oppose the instantaneous velocity fluctuation this product is always negative .",
    "therefore , the control actually extracts energy from the turbulent flow field .",
    "considering the fact that the wall normal velocity fluctuations are almost entirely damped to zero in the control region , the extracted power approaches very small values .",
    "for both control schemes in the present study , the power input to or the extraction from the flow field is so small that net energy savings rates are expected to be very similar to the drag reduction rates .",
    "while this holds for the considered idealized systems ( negligible pressure difference for continuous blowing and loss - free control actuators ) additional energy losses will be present for any non - ideal case but are not quantifiable without further specification of the control system .",
    "the persistent local drag change after the control region shown in figure  [ fig : r_rint ] suggests that the tbl recovers to the canonical state with a slightly different boundary layer thickness than it would have been at the same position in the uncontrolled case .",
    "this is confirmed in figure  [ fig : mt_shift](a ) , where the spatial development of the momentum thickness for the two controlled cases are shown .",
    "depending on the type of applied control , the momentum thickness at a certain streamwise position downstream of the control is either increased or decreased .",
    "the suppression of turbulence with body force damping leads to reduced momentum loss in the controlled region and thus to less increase of the momentum thickness .",
    "in contrast , uniform blowing directly increases the boundary layer thickness .",
    "this difference in momentum thickness remains even after the flow returns to an uncontrolled equilibrium state .",
    "we therefore propose that the remaining effect far downstream of the control region can be described by a streamwise shift @xmath80 of the virtual origin of the tbl as indicated in figure  [ fig : mt_shift](a ) .",
    "the solid lines in figure figure  [ fig : mt_shift](b ) show the evaluation of @xmath80 based on minimizing the difference between @xmath81 of the controlled case and @xmath82 @xmath83 it can be seen that the considered @xmath80 converges to a constant value downstream of the control region .",
    "it assumes positive values for body force damping and negative ones for uniform blowing .",
    "this different shift is consistent with the long tails of negative and positive @xmath69 observed for body force damping and uniform blowing , respectively , far downstream of the controlled region ( see figure  [ fig : r_rint ] ) .",
    "since the wall friction in the uncontrolled flow decreases monotonically with increasing streamwise distance from the leading edge , the positive / negative shift of the leading edge corresponds to an increase / decrease of local wall friction at a fixed streamwise position @xmath3 . in this respect ,",
    "uniform blowing is advantageous if long distances after the control are present because it yields not only a significant drag reduction in the controlled region , but also a greater momentum thickness ( and thereby lower wall friction ) downstream of the control region due to a negative @xmath80 .",
    "this estimation is based on the assumption that the flow far downstream of the control region returns to a canonical state .",
    "the assumption that the flow returns to the same generic boundary layer state is justified in the following : figure  [ fig : stat ] shows statistical properties of the uncontrolled flow and the two controlled flows shifted by the respective @xmath80 resulting in the same momentum thickness .",
    "it can be seen that very good agreement is achieved in case of body force damping while small deviations exist for uniform blowing in the outer layer .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the results of @xcite and indicate that in case of uniform blowing @xmath80 is not sufficient to produce a fully canonical state . in the present paper",
    "we choose to use the definition of @xmath80 as given by eq .   since we address properties of the mean flow only .     and ( b ) estimation of the corresponding spatial shift @xmath80",

    "the actual position corresponds to @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the uncontrolled flow , body force damping and uniform blowing , respectively .",
    "[ fig : stat ] ]      in order to investigate the control effect on the spatial development of the momentum thickness in more detail , we revisit the von krmn integral momentum equation @xcite describing the relationship between @xmath81 and the wall friction , based on the boundary - layer equations , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the static pressure and @xmath89 represents the variance around the local mean value of @xmath13 .",
    "integration of this equation in streamwise direction ( from the beginning of the turbulent region at @xmath34 to a point @xmath3 downstream of the controlled region ) leads to the following expression for @xmath81 : @xmath90_x + \\int_{0}^x \\frac{v_w \\left ( x \\right)}{u_\\infty } { \\mathrm{d}}x + 1 .",

    "( [ eq : karman ] ) are neglected because their streamwise integration results in a very small contribution to @xmath81 only .",
    "it should be noted that positive and negative local pressure gradients exist at the beginning and the end of the control region , respectively .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : karmanint ] ) can only be applied for estimations of @xmath81 far downstream of the controlled region . in the present case , the estimation based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : karmanint ] ) leads to deviations of less than @xmath91 if applied for @xmath92 in case of body force damping and @xmath93 for uniform blowing ( while the end of the controlled region is located at @xmath94 ) .",
    "these deviations decrease if longer integration areas are considered and are on the order of @xmath95 towards the end of the simulation domain .",
    "the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : karmanint ] ) describe the far downstream evolution of @xmath81 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand - side is proportional to the net - mass - flux from the wall up to a streamwise distance @xmath3 , and is present only for ( uniform ) blowing . in the case of body force",
    "damping this term is always null . in this case , drag reduction - i.e. a lower @xmath96_x$ ] - always leads to a slower increase of the momentum thickness .",
    "for uniform blowing , however , the momentum thickness can be greater than the uncontrolled value despite the fact that a reduction of the first term , i.e. , wall friction , is achieved because the second term is always positive .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : karmanint ] ) can be used to estimate the change of the momentum thickness caused by an arbitrary local control , it is not very convenient to describe the downstream development of the flow field since @xmath97 is a function of @xmath3 . in this respect ,",
    "it is more useful to convert the change in momentum thickness to the streamwise shift @xmath80 introduced in the previous section .",
    "an estimation of the streamwise shift from the change in momentum thickness can be performed using the empirical relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath24 proposed by @xcite : @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite , which provide a good agreement with the present simulation results .",

    "a schematic of tbl subject to local control is shown in figure  [ fig : regions ] .",

    "a parametric study with varying location of the control region reveals that the application of drag reducing control closer to the leading edge of the tbl is generally more beneficial in terms of integral drag reduction despite the fact that the local drag reduction rates show opposite trends for the two control configurations .    as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig : r_int_placement ] presents a comparison for different control placements .",
    "the beginning of the control region is placed at @xmath38 and @xmath109 , while all other control parameters are kept the same in physical units ; i.e. @xmath110 , turbulence damping is applied up to @xmath50 and the injected mass flow rate is fixed . for the cases where",
    "the control is placed farther downstream , the corresponding reynolds number range of the controlled region is @xmath111 or @xmath112 based on @xmath42 of the uncontrolled case .",

    "figures  [ fig : r_int_placement](a , b ) show the local drag reduction rate for these cases .    for body force damping the local control performance",
    "is slightly reduced in the case when the control is placed farther downstream ( @xmath115 maximum drag reduction instead of @xmath65 ) . a similar effect",
    "is known for tcf where @xmath69 decreases for increasing friction reynolds number when control is applied in the same near wall region in terms of viscous units @xcite . for tbl @xmath42",
    "slightly decreases with distance from the leading edge while the boundary layer thickness significantly increases .",
    "therefore , a placement further downstream corresponds to a placement at higher friction reynolds number .",
    "the reduction of @xmath69 with increasing @xmath116 is not surprising in the sense that the ratio of the wall - normal height of the control region to the boundary layer thickness is smaller ; i.e. @xmath117 at @xmath38 and @xmath91 at @xmath109 .",
    "although the general decrease of @xmath69 with increasing reynolds number for wall based skin friction drag reducing techniques is well known for tcf , the exact relationship is subject of present investigations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for uniform blowing the local control performance is slightly increased for farther downstream positioning of the control ( @xmath118 maximum drag reduction instead of @xmath66 ) .",
    "this difference can be understood if one considers the injected mass flow rate in viscous units .",
    "the viscous length scales decrease with @xmath3 such that in viscous units the injected mass flow rate is larger at the further downstream position .",
    "therefore , the resulting change in skin friction drag is larger .    since the local change of skin friction drag directly affects the change of the momentum thickness far downstream , as shown in figures  [ fig : r_int_placement](c , d ) , the control placement farther downstream results in a smaller positive @xmath97 for body force damping and a larger negative @xmath97 for uniform blowing . with respect to the global drag reduction rate eq .   can be used to establish a relationship between @xmath72 and the introduced @xmath97 : @xmath119 the momentum thickness at the end of the considered plate for uncontrolled flow conditions , @xmath120 , is a fixed value . for body force damping it holds that @xmath121 such that @xmath72 is solely determined by @xmath97 .",
    "the reduction of a positive @xmath97 as discussed above therefore corresponds to lower values for @xmath72 for later control placement which is in agreement with the results shown in figure  [ fig : r_int_placement](e ) . in the case of constant blowing @xmath46",
    "is constant such that differences in @xmath72 can also only arise from changes in @xmath97 .",

    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : r_int_placement](f ) confirm that lower @xmath72 values are indeed found for the later placement .",
    "actually , the reduction of @xmath72 is more pronounced for uniform blowing than for body force damping which is in agreement with the fact that larger changes in @xmath81 are introduced .    from figures  [ fig : r_int_placement](e , f )",
    "it is evident that the streamwise development of @xmath72 directly after the control section can include a positive streamwise gradient ( @xmath122 ) before @xmath72 decays continuously in the far downstream region : @xmath122 is found for body force damping ( regardless of the control placement ) and for the further downstream placement of uniform blowing .",

    "this dominance disappears eventually and @xmath126 is established for @xmath127 which suggests that further downstream application of blowing will not outperform its upstream application in terms of @xmath72 for the chosen control parameters .",

    "however , it has been shown that the far downstream effect of a control region in tbl can be characterized by a single quantity , namely @xmath80 , which represents a streamwise shift of the tbl virtual origin .",
    "therefore , the drag in this fully developed region can be estimated without relying on dns or experiments in very large domains .",
    "once the influence of drag reducing control on the tbl is reduced to @xmath80 the development of @xmath69 and @xmath128 for the fully developed region can be estimated using empirical correlations between the skin friction coefficient and the reynolds number , e.g. based on @xcite @xmath129 the streamwise coordinate @xmath130 that enters the reynolds number is the coordinate of the uncontrolled flow simply corrected by the shift such that @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the dimensional representation of @xmath80 and @xmath22 corresponds to the distance from the virtual origin of the uncontrolled solution .",
    "corresponding results are depicted in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : model](a ) and ( b ) show an excellent agreement between the model adopted for the fully developed region of the tbl and the dns data .",
    "the estimation can be used to further extrapolate the results and shows that local and global drag reduction rates will eventually vanish if long uncontrolled sections after the control region are considered .",

    "is estimated to be @xmath137 and @xmath138 for body force damping and uniform blowing , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : model](c ) shows a less pronounced permanent local drag increase for the body force damping and a higher local drag reduction for the uniform blowing when control is applied farther downstream .",
    "however , for both control schemes higher integral drag reduction is observed when control is placed closer to the leading edge of the tbl as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the global effect of locally applied skin friction drag reduction in tbl is addressed in this paper .",
    "we define a global drag reduction rate as an integral quantity that includes controlled and uncontrolled regions of the flow over a plate of finite length . in a tbl dns",
    "two fundamentally different drag reducing control schemes are locally applied and the global drag reducing effect is evaluated with a particular focus on the downstream development after the control region . although the control parameters are designed so that both control methods yield similar drag reduction rate inside the control region , the downstream development of the wall friction is found to be fundamentally different . the control scheme that attenuates",
    "turbulent activity leads to a thinner tbl downstream of the control region in comparison to the uncontrolled flow and thus yields local drag increase in this region .",
    "in contrast , the control scheme of local uniform blowing thickens the tbl downstream of local uniform blowing and therefore exhibits persistent drag reduction .",
    "the present results indicate that in a developing flow any local manipulation influences the downstream development via a streamwise shift of the uncontrolled solution . while the local drag reduction within the control region depends on the type of applied control and the location at which it is applied , the control effect far downstream of the control region",
    "can be generally expressed by a streamwise shift of the virtual origin of the tbl .",
    "since the streamwise shift captures the global influence of the particular control technique on tbl , the quantity can also be understood as a control performance index for tbl .",
    "the representation of the control effect through one single quantity allows predicting the drag behavior far downstream of the control without the need of dns or experiments in this region .",
    "for instance , such prediction enables an estimation of the distance over which a net drag reducing effect is observed when a large - eddy break - up device ( lebu ) is utilized for tbl control as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "in general , the present results indicate that drag reducing control applied in the beginning of a tbl has a higher global efficiency in term of the suggested integral drag reduction rate .",
    "in addition , it is shown that any local drag reduction effect vanishes from a global perspective if long uncontrolled sections after the control region are present .",
    "similar downstream effects like the ones reported here are likely to appear if local wall roughness is considered . skin friction drag will increase in the rough region but downstream of the rough region the increased boundary layer thickness will lead to lower local skin friction drag such that the global drag change strongly depends on the combination of rough and smooth regions along the plate .",
    "finally , it should be noted that for a plate of finite length the overall drag is not solely determined by skin friction .",
    "the wake of the plate , which depends on the boundary layer thickness at the trailing edge , will also contribute to the overall flow resistance .",
