    "scattering of two particles with charges @xmath53 in quantum states @xmath54 and @xmath55 on the coulomb potential @xmath56 leads to a transfer of momentum @xmath57 between them , so after the collision time @xmath58 the particles are in momentum states @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "moreover , the presence of an electromagnetic field may be expected to modify the dielectric and screening properties , leading to a very complex problem of coupled particle , screening and field dynamics .",
    "the appropriate theoretical concept to tackle this problem is provided by quantum field theory .",
    "numerous concepts have been developed to describe the mentioned above dynamics of particles and fields . among them , the most systematic and powerful is the theory of nonequilibrium green s functions .",
