    "dileptons are clean and penetrating probes for the hot and dense nuclear matter created by the high energy nuclear collisions because they do not suffer from strong interactions .",
    "they can be produced during all stages of a heavy ion collision , and their sources are expected to have different contributions to dileption invariant mass spectra . therefore , a systematic measurement of the dilepton pair distribution can reveal the properties of medium created by high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "dilepton measurements have been pursued for decades in heavy ion collisions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the ceres measurement of @xmath4 mass spectra showed a clear enhancement in the mass region below @xmath50.7 gev/@xmath1 compared to the known hadronic sources @xcite .",
    "high precision data from na60 suggested that this enhancement is consistent with in - medium broadening of the @xmath6 spectral function instead of a dropping of its pole mass hypothesis @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , slope parameters of dimuon transverse mass spectra showed a sudden drop above the @xmath7 mass after removing the correlated charm contributions .",
    "this is argued to be an indication of thermal dilepton from partonic source by the na60 collaboration @xcite . at rhic energy ,",

    "the main subsystems used in the analysis are time projection chamber(tpc ) @xcite and the time of flight ( tof ) @xcite .",
    "in addition of track reconstruction and momentum information , tpc also provides identification capabilities for charged particles by their ionization energy loss ( _ de / dx _ ) in the tpc gas . with the fully installed tof system ,",
    "the pid capabilities are greatly improved , especially in low @xmath3 region . with the combination of _ de / dx _ from tpc and velocity ( @xmath8 ) from tof , the electron purity is @xmath598% in p+p collisions , @xmath595% in au+au minimum bias collisions and @xmath593% in au+au central collisions .",
    "two methods were used in this analysis to reconstruct the background . in lmr , due to the correlated background , e.g. cross pair and jet contribution , we used the like - sign method background with an acceptance correction .",
