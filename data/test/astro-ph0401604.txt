    "galaxy clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound systems in the universe .",
    "the detailed analysis of the mass distribution of clusters is thus important in the process of understanding the large scale structure , and the nature of dark matter .",
    "the three main methods of measuring galaxy cluster masses : virial masses from velocity dispersions of cluster galaxies , x - ray imaging and spectroscopy of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) emission , and the gravitational lensing of background galaxies , have been found in recent years to be in disagreement for some clusters . generally , the x - ray estimates are in good agreement with gravitational lensing for clusters with a high concentration of central x - ray emission ( the so - called `` cooling flow '' clusters ) but seemingly in disagreement for other , less centrally peaked objects @xcite . to obtain the estimate of the total mass ( including that due to dark matter ) of a galaxy cluster from its x - ray emission  commonly assumed to be from optically thin , hot plasma that subtends the space between galaxies  it is necessary to make the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this is appropriate of course only for clusters that have had time to relax into equilibrium and have not experienced any recent merger events .",
    "generally , it is assumed that clusters with circular isophotes meet this criterion .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) hierarchal clustering is the leading theory describing the formation of large scale structure quite well .",
    "in particular , the numerical simulations such as @xcite ( nfw ) successfully reproduce the observed dark matter halo profiles , which appear be independent of the halo mass , initial power spectrum of fluctuations , and cosmological model .",
    "however , observations often disagree with the numerical models .",
    "for instance , one disagreement regards the rotation curves of dwarf elliptical galaxies which appear to be the result of a constant - density core whereas numerical simulations predict cuspy dark matter halo profiles @xcite .",
    "in addition , observations show fewer milky way satellites than predicted by the models @xcite . clearly , to understand the nature of galaxy clusters and the dark matter they consist of",
    ", it is important to measure the matter distribution in clusters via all available means .",
    "fortunately , there are two superb x - ray observatories , chandra and xmm - newton , featuring excellent angular resolution and exceptional effective area coupled with good spectral resolution , and those are well suited for detailed analysis of the x - ray emitting gas of galaxy clusters    abell 1689 is a cluster showing a large discrepancy among various mass determinations , and we chose it for a detailed study .",
    "it is a rich cluster , @xmath5 , without a pronounced cooling flow but with an approximately circular surface brightness distribution suggesting a relatively relaxed structure .",
    "the large mass , @xmath6 @xcite , and apparent symmetric distribution of abell 1689 make it a suitable cluster for gravitational lensing measurements as well as x - ray measurements .",
    "however , the type of clusters that are believed to be the most relaxed have a cool central component of enhanced surface brightness .",
    "the absence of such a component in abell 1689 suggests that the cluster is not fully relaxed .",
    "also , the galaxy content of the cluster is unusually spiral rich for a cluster with high spherical symmetry and richness , with a galaxy type ratio e : s0 : sp of approximately 22 : 22 : 28 plus 25 unidentified galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 for 66 cluster members , unusually high for a cluster of this temperature . positions and redshifts from @xcite for all cluster members with red magnitude @xmath8 and within @xmath9 of the brightest central galaxy are shown in fig .",
    "[ figoptical ] together with logarithmic x - ray intensity contours from xmm mos 1 .",
    "the gravitational lensing estimate from 6000 blue arcs and arclets calibrated by giant arcs at the einstein radius of abell 1689 gives a best fit power - law exponent of @xmath10 for the projected density profile from @xmath11 to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "( unless otherwise stated , we assume an einstein - desitter ( eds ) cosmology with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ) this is steeper than the profile of an isothermal sphere @xmath15 .",
    "the strong lensing analysis of two giant arcs directly gives @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the mass profile derived from the deficit of lensed red galaxies behind the cluster due to magnification and deflection of background galaxies suggests a projected mass profile of @xmath17 for @xmath18 , close to that of an isothermal sphere @xmath19 .",
    "the mass interior to @xmath20 from this method is @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "measurement of the distortion of the luminosity function due to gravitational lens magnification of background galaxies gives @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "finally , the weak gravitational shear of galaxies in a eso / mpg wide field imager @xmath23 image gives a mass profile with best fit nfw profile with @xmath24 and @xmath25 or a best fit sis with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "there is a good indication from the optical data that the cluster consists of substructures .",
    "@xcite suggest a strong lensing model with two clumps in order to reproduce the positions of the brightest arcs .",
    "a larger mass clump @xmath27 is centered on the brightest cluster galaxy while a smaller clump @xmath28 is located @xmath29 northeast of the main clump .",
    "they arrive at a mass a factor 2 - 2.5 lower for their x - ray estimate compared to their gravitational lensing model .",
    "@xcite identify two distinct substructures centered on redshifts @xmath30 and @xmath31 using positional and redshift data of cluster galaxies from @xcite , providing further evidence that the cluster is not relaxed .",
    "these clumps are also aligned in the southwest  northeast direction but the locations do not agree with the ones of @xcite .",
    "both structures are found to have @xmath32 yielding virial masses several times smaller than those derived from lensing and x - ray estimates .",
    "can the x - ray observations provide any evidence for a substructure in abell 1689 , and what are the implications on the mass inferred from the x - ray data ? in an attempt to answer this ,",
    "we analyze xmm - newton epic pn and epic mos data to measure the mass profile of a1689 and to investigate the spatial structure of the cluster . ",
    "2 contains the details of the observations and data reduction with the xmm - newton as well as with summary of the rosat , asca and chandra data ;  3 covers the methods of spectral fitting of the xmm data and presents the analysis of cluster asymmetry ;  4 derives the mass and the slope of the mass distribution in the core ; and  5 presents the inferences about the structure of the cluster inferred from the spatial analysis .",
    "the paper concludes with the summary in  6 .",
    "abell 1689 was observed with xmm - newton for 40 ks on december 24th 2001 during revolution 374 .",
    "for imaging spectroscopy we use data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) detectors mos1 , mos2 and pn .",
    "both mos cameras were operating in the full frame mode whereas pn was using the extended full frame mode .",
    "the extended full frame mode for pn is appropriate for studying diffuse sources since it has lower time resolution and so it is less sensitive to contamination from photons being detected during readout of the ccds .",
    "these events ( so called out - of - time events ) show up as streaks across the x - ray image and are especially bothersome when the goal of an observation is spatially resolved spectroscopy of diffuse sources .",
    "all cameras used the thin filter during the observation .",
    "epic background is comprised mainly of three components .",
    "the external particle background consists primarily of soft protons @xmath33 being funneled through the mirrors and causing a time variable flaring signal in the detector .",
    "the internal particle background is mainly due to high energy particles interacting with the detector material and causing a roughly flat spectrum with flourescent emission - lines characteristic to the detector material .",
    "this component varies over the detector surface .",
    "the third source of background is the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) which is roughly constant in time but varies over the sky .",
    "for all data reduction we use the software and calibration data implemented in xmm science analysis software ( sas ) 5.4.1 . to exclude the events contaminated by proton flares , we produce light curves in the @xmath34kev band where the true x - ray signal is low .",
    "we screen the data using a constraint on the total count rate of less than 1.5 ct s@xmath35 for mos and 1.1 ct s@xmath35 for pn in this band , leaving an effective exposure time of 37 ks for mos and 29 ks for pn .",
    "this screening corresponds to a limit on the count rate of approximately @xmath36 above the quiescent period in the @xmath37kev band .",
    "the effective mirror collecting area of xmm - newton is not constant across the field of view : it decreases with increasing off - axis angle and this decrease is energy dependent .",
    "this results in a position dependent decrease in the fraction of detected events and when doing imaging spectroscopy for extended sources , we need to account for this effect . by generating an ancillary response",
    "file ( arf ) for each source spectrum region , using xmm sas 5.4.1 command ` arfgen ` we calculate an average effective area for each region considered by us ( see below ) .      in order to correctly account for particle - induced and cosmic x - ray background",
    ", it would be optimal to extract a background spectrum from the same detector region collected at the same time as the source spectrum .",
    "this is of course impossible , and the background can be taken from a source - free region of the detector ( other than the target , but near it ) , or can be estimated using blank sky data .",
    "we adopt the former method , noting that the background is not entirely constant over the field of view ; however , it can be assumed to be approximately constant with the exception of the fluorescent cu line at @xmath38 in pn which is the strongest contaminant emission line . using this assumption",
    ", we can effectively subtract the particle background by extracting a spectrum in a source free region in the same exposure .",
    "for pn data in the @xmath39 range is excluded due to the strong spatial dependence of the cu internal emission .",
    "using an arf generated for a source region on a background subtracted spectrum will not take into account that the spectrum used as background was extracted from a different region where the vignetting was higher , due to the larger off - axis distance of the background region .",
    "this will have the effect that the cxb component in our source spectrum will be under - subtracted and the net spectrum will contain some remnant of the cxb .",
    "the particle induced background however is not vignetted and therefore should leave no remnant .    to estimate the cxb component in our exposure we take the events outside of the field - of - view to be the particle background .",
    "another spectrum is then extracted from a large source free area , located away from the cluster .",
    "the particle background is normalized and removed from this spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectrum is fitted to a broken power law model to determine the cxb flux .",
    "the incorrect vignetting correction of the cxb is found to cause an at most 2 % over - estimation of the flux which is the case in the outermost annulus in our analysis ( see below ) .",
    "however since the vignetting is energy - dependent , the incorrect vignetting may cause a small ( @xmath40 kev ) shift in temperature for the outermost region .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the background is estimated to be at most a few percent .",
    "we compare our background subtraction method with the method of using xmm standard blank sky data compiled by @xcite ; we find that both methods give similar fit parameters .",
    "however , given the difficulty of normalizing the cxb , the different high - energy leftovers from proton - flare subtraction and the different internal particle background which occurs when using background data from a different exposure , we chose to use in - field ( rather than blank - sky ) background .",
    "we find this is more robust in keeping the overall shape of the source spectrum uncontaminated . in all our analysis",
    "we use a background region of a circular annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "in fact , recent work by @xcite suggests that the in - field background method is probably more accurate .",
    "the clusters in the above paper , however , have smaller apparent angular size which makes the background method more reliable .      in analyzing the vignetting corrected , background subtracted radial count - rate profile , we fit it to a conventional beta model , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the source surface brightness at radius @xmath45 .",
    "the fit gives @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 using data out to @xmath49 .",
    "clearly this model is not a very good fit ; we show it here only for completeness and comparison with previous work , and note that it is not used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the bad fit above results from the fact that the cluster emission is more peaked in the core than the best fit beta model . to obtain a general idea of the properties of the cluster and compare this with previous results",
    ", we extracted spectra for the central @xmath50 @xmath51 region , centered on the x - ray centroid at @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "this radius corresponds to @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "background spectra were extracted from source - free regions from the same exposure .",
    "for xmm pn we use single and double pixel events only whereas for xmm mos we also use triple and quadruple pixel events .    for spectral fitting",
    "we use the xspec @xcite software package .",
    "we fit the data in the @xmath56 range using the mekal @xcite model for the optically thin plasma and galactic absorption . with the absorption fixed at the galactic value , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xcite , and assuming a redshift @xmath59 we arrive at a temperature of @xmath60 and a metal abundance of @xmath61 solar for both mos cameras with @xmath62 . from the pn camera",
    "we get @xmath63 and @xmath64 solar with @xmath65 .",
    "the best fit models with residuals can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mospn ] for mos ( left ) and pn ( right ) .",
    "the pn temperature is in disagreement with mos data and the reason for this effect can be seen from the residuals below 1 kev for pn ( fig .",
    "[ mospn ] ( right ) ) . fitting the pn data above 1 kev we get @xmath66 and @xmath67 solar with @xmath68 , in better agreement with mos .",
    "the temperature from mos is in agreement with that found by asca , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this observation does not suffer from pile - up , nor is the low energy spectrum sensitive to background subtraction .",
    "the background uncertainties below 1 kev for this pn spectrum are less than 1 % whereas the pn soft excess is sometimes higher than 10 % .",
    "the excess is certainly not background related .",
    "it is possible that the pn low - energy discrepancy can be due to incorrect treatment of charge collection at lower energies ( s. snowden , priv .",
    "comm . ) . to resolve the discrepancy between mos and pn we decided to compare with asca gis / sis , rosat pspc and chandra acis - i data .",
    "besides the discrepancy regarding the softest x - ray band for the abell 1689 data between the mos and pn detectors aboard xmm - newton , the spectral fits to the chandra data presented by @xcite imply a higher absorbing column , @xmath70 @xmath58 than the galactic value of @xmath71 @xmath58 @xcite . since such excess absorption is not commonly detected in x - ray data for clusters , this requires further investigation . to determine if there is indeed any additional component of absorption beyond that attributable to the galactic column  and assess the reliability of the softest energy band of the pn vs. mos data ",
    "we used the most sensitive soft ( @xmath72 kev ) x - ray data for this cluster obtained prior to the xmm - newton observations , collected by the rosat pspc . the rosat observation conducted during july 18 - 24 , 1992 ( available from heasarc ) yielded 13.5 ks of good data .",
    "we extracted the rosat pspc counts from a region @xmath73 in radius , centered on the nominal center of x - ray emission . for background",
    ", we selected a source - free region of the same pspc image . using these data over the nominal energy range 0.15 - 2.1 kev with the standard pspc response matrix applicable to the observation epoch",
    ", we performed a spectral fit to a simple , single - temperature mekal model with soft x - ray absorption due to gas with solar abundances , using the xspec package as above . in the fit we use metal abundances of 0.27 solar",
    "obtained in the xmm mos fit above .",
    "while the limited bandpass of rosat pspc precludes an accurate determination of the temperature ( the best fit value is @xmath74 kev , 90% confidence regions quoted ) , the pspc data provide a good measure of the absorbing column : the best value is @xmath75 @xmath58 , certainly consistent with the galactic value .",
    "we note that the difference between the temperature inferred from the pspc fit and that obtained from the xmm - newton data as above is a result of the limited bandpass of the pspc , located much below the peak of the energy distribution of the cluster photons .",
    "the measurement of the absorbing column , however , clearly indicates that the column inferred from the chandra observation by @xcite is not correct , and might be due to instrumental effects .",
    "we conclude that the absorbing column is consistent with the galactic value .    to obtain further constraints on the absorbing column",
    ", we also used the asca gis and sis data together with the pspc data for an independent constraint on the continuum radiation in the fitting process .",
    "we performed standard extraction of data from all asca detectors , also from a region from a region @xmath73 in radius for the source , and a source - free region of the same image for background .",
    "we performed a spectral fit simultaneously to data from the pspc and four asca detectors . to account for possible flux calibration differences ,",
    "we let the normalization among all the different detectors run free .",
    "we used the energy range of @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the asca gis and sis cameras respectively .",
    "since asca detectors ( and in particular , the siss ) often return spectral fits with excess intrinsic absorption @xcite we also let the absorbing column be fitted independently for the gis , sis and pspc detectors .",
    "temperature and metal abundances were tied together for all datasets in the fit .",
    "the optical redshift @xmath0 was used .",
    "the joint fit of rosat and asca data gives us the best fit temperature of @xmath78 kev and abundances of @xmath79 solar , in agreement with the values quoted by @xcite , and the absorption ( for the pspc data ) @xmath80 @xmath58 , in agreement with the galactic hi 21 cm data .",
    "we shall use this value for the absorption in the subsequent analysis .",
    "this best fit rosat / asca model was compared with the data from the same region in the xmm - newton cameras giving an unfitted reduced @xmath81 of 1.39 for pn and 1.06 for both mos cameras combined .",
    "the ratio of these spectra to the rosat / asca model can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mospndisc ] . from this result",
    "we conclude that mos low energy response is more consistent with previous data and subsequently , we choose to ignore all pn data below @xmath82 .",
    "re - fitting the xmm data from the above region using @xmath83 for mos data and @xmath84 for pn leaving the absorbing column as a free parameter yields @xmath85 @xmath58 , a temperature of @xmath86 and metallicity of @xmath87 solar . while this fitted value of absorption is formally inconsistent with the galactic and rosat - inferred values , this is a relatively small difference , which might be due to the slightly imperfect calibration of the mos detectors or the assumption of isothermality made by us for this fit ( since @xmath88 and @xmath89 are correlated in the fitting procedure ) .",
    "we note that using the rosat value for absorption will give us a somewhat lower measure on the temperature ( see below ) .",
    "finally , we reduced the chandra data for abell 1689 using the most recent release of data reduction software ; specifically , due to the degradation of the chandra acis - i low - energy response correction for the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) is necessary , and we applied this to the chandra data .",
    "as of chandra data analysis software package ciao ver .",
    "2.3 this correction can be applied in the standard event processing .",
    "it is also necessary to account for the acis excess low - energy absorption due to hydrocarbon contamination .",
    "we used the ` acisabs ` code for the correction to the auxiliary response function .",
    "the event grades used in the acis analysis were grade=0,2,3,4 and 6 .",
    "the cluster was observed with the chandra acis - i detector array at two separate occasions for @xmath90ks each on 2000 - 04 - 15 and 2001 - 01 - 07 .",

    "[ chandra ] shows the ratio of the combined chandra data to the best fit model determined from rosat and asca above .",
    "the left spectrum is before and the right after the ` acisabs ` correction .",
    "fitting the corrected spectrum to an absorbed mekal model in the energy range 0.3 - 7.0 kev yields absorption of @xmath91 @xmath58 , a temperature of @xmath92 kev and abundances of @xmath93 solar using the optical redshift z=0.183 .",
    "the discrepant absorption found by @xcite ( using data 0.7 - 9.0 kev ) is apparently corrected for by ` acisabs ` and the value is in agreement galactic absorption .",
    "however there is still a large discrepancy in temperature , which also can be seen from the high energy ends of fig .",
    "[ chandra ] .",
    "part of this effect can possibly be attributed to the high energy particle background but more likely to uncorrected instrumental effects .",
    "repeating all above steps for single pixel events only ( grade=0 ) in order to achieve higher spectral accuracy gives us a best fit temperature of @xmath94 kev .",
    "we can not account for the differences between the two chandra data sets ( using grade=0 vs. grade=0,2,3,4 and 6 events ) nor between the results of the chandra and xmm spectral fits .",
    "we note here that the photon statistics resulting from the xmm observation is superior to that in the chandra data , and since our analysis does not require the superior angular resolution of the chandra mirror , we limit the analysis below to the xmm data .",
    "to obtain a radial profile of cluster gas temperature , abundance , and density , we first make the assumption that the cluster is spherical and that above properties are only functions of radius . for this",
    ", we divide the image of the cluster into 11 concentric annuli out to @xmath95 @xmath96 centered on the x - ray centroid . for each annulus , we extract spectra from all epic cameras , and we set the inner and outer radii of each region by requiring that each annulus contains at least 9000 counts per each mos camera and 13000 for pn .",
    "this allows us to derive a reliable estimate of temperature in each region .",
    "point sources with intensities greater than @xmath97 over the average are excluded .",
    "the outer radii of the annuli are as follows : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "average cluster properties were determined using all annular spectra simultaneously out to @xmath109 ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) using the same spectral fitting procedures as in section [ fitting ] .",
    "we use the optical redshift of @xmath59 @xcite and the line of sight absorption of @xmath112 as measured from rosat data , and also consistent with the galactic column density ( section [ rosasc ] ) .",
    "the mean temperature of the cluster is found to be @xmath113 and the mean abundance @xmath114 solar .",
    "we note that leaving the redshift as a free parameter gives a best fit redshift @xmath115 ( 90% confidence range ) which is considerably less than measured via optical observations . considering mos and pn data separately gives @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .    in order to take into account the three - dimensional nature of the cluster we consider the spectrum from each of the 11 annuli to be a superposition of spectra from a number of concentric spherical shells intersected by the same annulus .",
    "the spherical shells have the same spherical radii as the projected radii of the annuli .",
    "we assume that each shell has a constant temperature , gas density and abundance .",
    "the volume for each annulus / shell intersection is calculated to determine how large a fraction of emission from each shell should be attributed to each annulus .",
    "assigning a spectral model to each spherical shell we can simultaneously fit the properties of all spherical shells .    in practice",
    "we use the method of @xcite where we have a matrix of @xmath118 mekal models with absorption in xspec . in the process of fitting the data in xspec , each datagroup ( consisting of three data files : pn , mos1 and mos2 spectra for each annulus )",
    "is fitted using the same set of models . for the central annulus ( the one with zero inner radius",
    "so it s actually a circle ) , which will intersect all 11 spherical shells , we will need to apply 11 mekal models to represent these .",
    "this means that we have to apply 11 mekal models to each datagroup ( annulus ) with absorption where each model represents the properties of one spherical shell .",
    "the normalization of each shell model is set to be the ratio of the volume that shell occupies in the cylinder that is the annulus / shell intersection to the volume it occupies in the central annulus .",
    "abundance and temperature are tied together for the models representing the same spherical shell .",
    "of course not all annuli intersect every shell , and for those shells not intersected by the annulus to which they are attributed , the model normalization will be zero .",
    "the matrix of mekal models is thus triangular and can be fitted directly to the spectra we have extracted from annular regions in the data .",
    "this approach allows for all data to be fitted simultaneously , and we do not have the problem with error propagation which occurs when starting to fit the outermost annulus and propagating inward subtracting contributions from each previous shell .    the metallicity profile ( fig .",
    "[ abun ] ) from the deprojection shows signs of increasing abundance toward the center of the cluster . in temperature",

    "gas dynamic simulations of the formation of galaxy clusters also show a decline of temperature at large radii @xcite .",
    "we do not find a significant cooling in the cluster core with the highest temperature ( @xmath120 ) near the core radius : in fact , we will show in section [ xyana ] that the temperature profile is not symmetric around the cluster center .",
    "we note that for completeness , we also performed the above analysis with the best - fit value of the redshift inferred from the x - ray data alone , and while the exact values of temperature and elemental abundances are slightly different , about 0.2 kev lower for temperature , the general trends in the radial runs of the parameters are the same .",
    "the limited point spread function ( psf ) of the xmm mirrors is a potential problem especially for the annuli located close to the center since those are not much larger than the psf fwhm of @xmath121 .",
    "some of the flux incident on the central ( circular ) region will be distributed over the outer annuli and vice versa .",
    "this flux redistribution will have the effect of smoothing out the measured temperature profile since all annuli will have some flux that originally belong in other annuli .",
    "this effect has been studied in detail by e.g. @xcite who find that correcting for the psf redistribution gives a profile that is consistent with an uncorrected profile .",
    "abell 1689 has a temperature profile without large temperature variations and no large central flux concentration .",
    "we conclude that the effect of flux redistribution in our case will be small and we do not attempt to correct for this . the psf is also weakly energy dependent , and to quantify its possible effect on the observed temperature profile , we calculate the energy dependent flux loss from the central annulus and the effect on the central temperature .",
    "the difference in flux loss between various energy bands ( ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 kev ) for the on - axis psf is @xmath122 .",
    "we find that for a cluster with an assumed temperature of 9 kev , this could give an error of the central temperature by at the most @xmath123 .",

    "this apparently perfect agreement among x - ray , lensing , and optical centers leads us to conclude that the icm density peak and the central dominant galaxy is probably located at the bottom of the dark matter potential well . still , the apparent non - uniformity of the icm radial temperature distribution as well as the offset of optical and x - ray redshifts prompted us to analyze the spatial structure of the cluster . in fig .

    "the errors on the temperature of the inner 16 regions are @xmath144 , while the errors on the outer 8 regions are @xmath145 .",
    "we clearly see an asymmetry in the temperature around the cluster center with an overall increase toward the northeast .    to check the consistency of these results and to increase our accuracy , we re - group the data in larger spatial regions and perform a fit using the same above procedure .",
    "we first fit the data keeping the redshift frozen at the optical value .",

    "the redshift map reveals a high redshift structure to the east at @xmath146 separated from the rest of the cluster at @xmath147 . analyzing the mos and",
    "pn data separately for this high redshift region gives a broad minimum in @xmath81 at @xmath148 for mos whereas pn shows several minima in the @xmath149 range .",
    "this region may indicate a subcluster falling inward away from the observer .",
    "this is further supported by the optical data , indicating that there are also high - redshift giant elliptical galaxies in this region ( fig .",
    "[ figoptical ] ) : it is interesting to speculate if this is actually the remains of a cluster core ? especially intriguing is the apparent coincidence between the smaller subcluster as suggested by strong lensing @xcite and our high redshift gas region approximately @xmath150 northeast of the main cluster .",
    "another possibility is that the redshift variation is due to large bulk motions of the intra - cluster gas .",
    "it has been shown in gas dynamic simulations that clusters with apparently relaxed x - ray profiles can have complex gas - velocity fields and be far from relaxed @xcite .",
    "this kind of motion could give rise to non - thermal emission from shocks etc .",
    "in our analysis we can not distinguish between the two possibilities of bulk motion and subclustering .",
    "this measurement of non - uniform redshift distribution of the x - ray emitting gas is important , and to verify if it could be due to instrumental effects , we investigated this in more detail .",
    "the data in the regions above are from different ccd chips in the pn data whereas for mos all data are from the same chip .",
    "since the pn camera provides about half of the data , we want to verify that there are no gain shifts between the ccds , which , if present , could easily cause such an effect .",
    "most of the cluster emission is on the ccd chips 4 and 7 . to test for any possible gain offset",

    "the spectra in the range @xmath39 are fitted to a gaussian profile : both datasets yield essentially the same peak position of @xmath153 .",
    "this corresponds to a possible artificial redshift offset of maximum @xmath154 .",
    "to explain the difference in the offset measured by us as an instrumental effect , we would have to have an offset ( say at the fe k line at 6.7 kev ) of 62 ev , and not on the order of 1 ev , as inferred from the cu k instrumental line .",
    "hence we conclude that there is no gain shift that could alter our redshift measurements between pn ccds 4 and 7 .",
    "according to xmm calibration documentation @xcite the magnitude of calibration errors for pn & mos should be no larger than 10 ev .",

    "the two component model of @xcite also strongly suggests non - uniformity .",
    "this might explain the discrepancies between mass estimates from gravitational lensing and from x - rays .",

    "we assume that we have two perfectly spherical clusters aligned exactly along the line of sight having identical mass ( @xmath235 ) and gas density ( @xmath236 ) . since the thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity scales as @xmath237 we will measure a surface intensity @xmath238 and from this infer a gas density @xmath239 .",

    "would actually be overestimated which is the opposite of what we find .",
    "however if a merger was in fact taking place the hydrostatic equation would probably be quite inaccurate estimation of the mass .",
    "there would be other sources of pressure and probably the cluster would not be in equilibrium : examples here might be magnetic fields , or additional pressure support from non - thermal particles , likely to be accelerated in shocks that arise during a merger . also since we do not detect two separate peaks in the surface intensity map , it is much more likely we have a lower density companion cluster or one merging irregular system .",
    "there is a good evidence suggesting that abell 1689 is undergoing a merger .",
    "we find that the x - ray measurement yields the value of mass that is low in comparison to gravitational lensing and the m - t relation for relaxed clusters , both by about a factor 2 .",
    "we have shown that this may be the result of grouping or elongation along the line of sight .",
    "the cluster has a low gas mass fraction compared to other clusters , which is perhaps the result of large scale gas motion .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the member galaxies is very high and there are hints of subgroupings in the redshift space .",
    "the high number of spiral galaxies is unusual for a rich cluster and suggests a lower density region , where the spiral fraction would be higher , perhaps in front of or behind the main cluster .",
    "a state of complex dynamics is supported by the non - uniform temperature distribution and maybe most importantly by the variation in redshift of the x - ray emitting gas across the cluster .",
    "finally , recent measurements of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect by @xcite indicate that the inferred optical depth of the comptonizing gas might actually be higher than one would infer from the simple spherically symmetric model obeying hydrostatic equilibrium , and a clumpy or elongated structure ( aligned along the line of sight ) would alleviate the discrepancy .",
    "clearly , this cluster deserves further detailed studies ; it is a very interesting potential target for the astro - e2 mission , where the x - ray calorimeter will provide an unprecedented spectral resolution , capable of clearly confirming the complex redshift structure of the intra - cluster gas , hinted by the xmm data .",
    "if the cluster is indeed undergoing a merger , this might provide an environment where at least some fraction of the gas is accelerated ( for instance , via shocks ) to form a non - thermal distribution of particles , which might produce radiation detectable in radio ( via synchrotron emission ) , in hard x - rays ( by comptonizing the cosmic microwave background ) , and in gamma rays , potentially detectable by the future mission glast .",
    "the superior effective area of the xmm - newton telescope has allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of abell 1689 . comparing with the data from rosat , asca and chandra we verified that the data are consistent with earlier observations .",
    "importantly , there is no indication of any additional absorbing component in the xmm data , attributing the low - energy excess absorption found by @xcite in the chandra data to uncorrected instrumental effects .",
    "the now available ` acisabs ` code successfully corrects for these effects .",
    "we confirm earlier findings that there is a large discrepancy , of a factor 2 or more , between mass estimates from gravitational lensing and x - ray derived mass using an unparameterized deprojection technique .",
    "our analysis indicates that this discrepancy is true for the central part of the cluster , but also might be the case for the entire observable cluster ; our finding is in contrast to @xcite , who conclude that at large radii , there is no disagreement between the x - ray and lensing masses .",
    "although the x - ray determined mass appears to be discrepant from the values determined from most lensing techniques , it seems to be in good agreement with that derived from weak gravitational shear .",
    "we compare the gas mass of the cluster with the total mass , and find that for abell 1689 , @xmath191 is @xmath250 , significantly less than @xmath251 , the value derived by @xcite for 10 dynamically relaxed clusters .",
    "our calculation of the asymmetric temperature distribution of the cluster provides further evidence that this cluster is not in a relaxed state : the lower than expected gas mass fraction is yet another piece of evidence .",
    "we also present the first measurement of asymmetries in redshift for different regions of the icm in the cluster determined from the x - ray data alone .",
    "a similar analysis was done by @xcite who claim a 3-@xmath252 detection of bulk motion from asca observations of the centaurus cluster .",
    "we argue that the redshift variation detected here might be either due to line - of - sight clustering or possibly due to large bulk motions of the gas . even though this cluster is clearly not as relaxed as might be expected from its apparent spherical form , we find the slope of the total mass in the central region to be in good agreement with what is expected from numerical simulations of structure formation .",
    "the density slope for @xmath253 is @xmath254 . while our current understanding of the structure and dynamics of galaxy clusters is insufficient to put limits on the self - interaction of dark matter , better data and more accurate simulations appear promising for the future .",
