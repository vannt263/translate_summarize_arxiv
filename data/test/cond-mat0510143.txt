    "the 1995 discovery of bose - einstein condensation in dilute ultracold gases @xcite prompted a flurry of activity investigating these fascinating quantum systems . in the experiments ,",
    "ultracold atoms are confined by magnetic or optical forces , which typically can be represented theoretically by a harmonic potential . lately , however , an increasing amount of interest has focused on bose condensates in more exotic trapping potentials .",
    "for example , gupta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently produced a condensate in a ring - shaped magnetic waveguide , while experiments at ecole normale suprieure @xcite have been conducted in overlapping magnetic and optical dipole traps , leading to a potential which can be approximated by a function which is quadratic plus quartic in the radial coordinate .",
    "this trap potential is especially of interest when the condensate is rotating , since , in contrast to the harmonic case , one can in principle achieve arbitrarily high angular velocities .",
    "this leads to interesting new configurations , for example a vortex lattice with a hole at its center , and for even higher angular velocities , annular condensates containing a multiply - quantized `` macrovortex '' .",
    "these equilibrium configurations have been studied in a number of papers @xcite , where the angular velocities for transitions between the different states , defining a phase diagram , were calculated in refs .",
    "in addition to the static properties , the dynamics have also been addressed , with the collective mode excitations considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could consider the case where , in addition to the quartic term , there is a _ negative _ harmonic term .",
    "then the radial trap potential has the form of a `` mexican hat '' , and the condensate can be annular even when there is no rotation .",
    "similar trap configurations have been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "of particular interest , however , is the behavior of the system under rotation , since vortices can enter the condensate and form a stable , multiply - quantized vortex at the center .",
    "for example , an important question raised in this configuration concerns the stability of the vortex in the presence of a non - rotating thermal cloud at finite temperatures does the vortex decay by spiraling towards the edge as in a harmonic trap @xcite , or is it metastable ?",
    "this is related to the well - known problem of stability of persistent currents in superfluids @xcite , and so is of interest from a fundamental perspective .    in order to tackle these types of questions",
    "experimentally it is important to possess some way of detecting the presence of a vortex . in a harmonically - trapped condensate",
    "this is relatively straightforward , since the fluid circulation around the vortex core creates a hole in the density , which can be detected by standard absorption imaging . since the optical resolution is usually not sufficient to detect vortices",
    "_ in situ _ , a period of free expansion following the release of the condensate from the trap is generally required . however , in a trapped annular condensate vortices reside in the center where the density is very low irrespective of the circulation .",
    "hence , imaging of a vortex _ in situ _ is precluded , and it is not even obvious _ a priori _ whether it is possible to resolve the vortex after expansion . a more detailed analysis is thus required in order to evaluate the feasibility of this and other possible schemes for vortex detection .    in this paper we shall study two - dimensional condensates , where the trap potential has a quartic minus quadratic radial dependence .",
    "most of our results for thin annular condensates , however , also apply to more general mexican hat potentials .",
    "two dimensions in this context corresponds to either a cylindrical condensate , where the axial length scale greatly exceeds the radial size , or a thin disk - shaped condensate where the system is tightly trapped in the axial direction such that dynamics along this coordinate are `` frozen out '' and can be neglected .",
    "both geometries are of experimental interest .",
    "we also focus exclusively on condensates in the mean field regime at zero temperature , where the properties can be accurately described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention that the possibility of obtaining a thin annulus , essentially a one - dimensional system , opens up other interesting regimes beyond mean field , such as a quasi - condensate or tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "we begin by studying the equilibrium states , where both numerical solutions and analytical results are presented .",
    "we then characterize the lowest energy excitations , or collective modes , of the condensate .",
    "in particular , we use a hydrodynamic model to derive analytical expressions in the limit of thin annuli , as well as to find the mode frequencies numerically .",
    "we also compare these results to numerical simulations of the gp equation .",
    "this allows us to discuss the use of collective modes to detect vorticity ; namely the splitting between counter - propagating surface and acoustic modes of the condensate .",
    "we then consider the expansion of the condensate after switching off the confining potential , finding that the hole due to the vortex is recovered in the expanded density , providing a simple means to detect the presence of the vortex in experiments .",
    "finally , we discuss the momentum distribution of an annular condensate , finding that in the limit of thin annuli the function approaches a simple analytical form .",
    "for a dilute bose - einstein condensate in the limit of zero temperature , the time - dependent evolution of the condensate wavefunction @xmath0 is described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath1 the interactions between atoms are represented by the parameter @xmath2 , for @xmath3 atoms of mass @xmath4 , with @xmath5-wave scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "note that , in addition to the dynamics of the condensate , the time - independent stationary states can be found by substituting @xmath7 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp-3d ] ) , whereupon the left - hand side becomes @xmath8 with @xmath9 the chemical potential . the external potential in eq .",

    "we shall mostly use harmonic oscillator units where distance , time and energy are expressed in units of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "we also take @xmath17 , where the case of @xmath18 has already been extensively studied in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "we explicitly consider the gp equation in 2d @xmath19 \\psi \\ , , \\label{eq : gp}\\ ] ] where the evolution in the axial coordinate is neglected .",
    "physically this can correspond to the case of a cylindrical condensate , where @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction parameter then becomes , @xmath21 , in harmonic oscillator units , where @xmath22 represents the number of atoms per unit length along the axial direction .",
    "an alternative two - dimensional configuration involves tight axial confinement , such that @xmath23 in physical units . in this geometry , which has been realized experimentally @xcite , the axial dynamics are `` frozen out '' .",
    "the axial dependence of the wavefunction is then gaussian , and the 2d gp equation  ( [ eq : gp ] ) can be used with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we first analyze a condensate without a vortex using the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , where the spatial derivative of @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) is neglected , so that the density is given by @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "the radii of the condensate are evaluated by finding where the density goes to zero . if @xmath29 then there is a single solution of the resulting quadratic equation , @xmath30 , which corresponds to a condensate without a hole . on the other hand , if @xmath31 there are two solutions @xmath32 , and the condensate is annular with a hole in the center . in this case",
    "one can write the tf condensate density as @xmath33 for @xmath27 . calculating the radii and chemical potential",
    "more explicitly requires the condition that the wavefunction is normalized to unity @xmath34 .",

    "the limit @xmath41 corresponds to the case where the width of the annulus becomes much smaller than the radius .",
    "the range of validity of the tf approximation for an annular condensate is defined by the condition @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 is the healing length at the density maximum , while @xmath44 is the width of the annulus .",
    "using the above expressions yields the explicit relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the condensate can also contain a single centered vortex with circulation @xmath47 , where the well - known requirement of quantized circulation in superfluids @xcite constrains the vorticity to integer values @xmath48 .",

    "one could in principle increase the amplitude of the mode by using a large perturbation ( large @xmath194 ) , but as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq5](b ) this can lead to nonlinear coupling of the mode to higher excitations , leading to a rapid damping ( note that this damping is absent for smaller perturbations , e.g.  @xmath195 ) .",
    "so there is a trade off involved in choosing the size of the perturbation , and this may in practice limit the utility of collective modes for vortex detection .",
    "one alternative to using mode frequencies to detect vorticity in annular condensates was proposed by tempere _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and involves allowing an expanding condensate to overlap with an another expanding condensate without a vortex .",
    "the resulting interference pattern reveals the presence of a vortex in the first condensate .",
    "however , this method may be difficult to realize experimentally , and a much simpler procedure would be to use only one condensate and allow it to expand freely after switching off the trapping potential .",
    "the central question to be addressed in this section is whether imaging the resulting density profile would provide a means to distinguish between states containing a vortex and those without .",
    "we study this question by starting with the gp equilibrium state either with or without a vortex , then propagating the 2d time - dependent gp equation with @xmath196 set to zero .",
    "we study the narrow annulus case mentioned at the end of the previous section , where @xmath158 and @xmath160 .",
    "[ fig : exp - xsec ] shows radial cross - sections through the density for @xmath113 , @xmath175 and @xmath193 for various times during the expansion .",
    "initially at @xmath197 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - xsec](a ) ) there is very little difference between the three configurations , illustrating the difficulty in distinguishing between the three states _ in - situ_. after release from the trap ( @xmath198 ) we see that the condensate expands radially both outwards and inwards , thereby filling the annulus .",
    "so , even at @xmath199 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - xsec](b ) ) the different states are , in principle , distinguishable due to the density hole produced by the centrifugal barrier near to the vortex core .",
    "one can also see the development of interference fringes away from the center .",
    "[ fig : exp - xsec](c ) and ( d ) show the condensate after further expansion .",
    "the size of the density dip at the vortex core is proportional to the healing length , @xmath200 , so that the vortex expands along with the condensate due to the corresponding decrease in density .",
    "the vortex size can be quantified in the simulations by measuring the width at half the maximum density of the condensate , which for @xmath175 gives radii of 0.75 at @xmath201 and @xmath202 at @xmath203 . using the example parameters introduced in the last section",
    ", this would correspond to vortex core diameters of @xmath204 and @xmath205 at @xmath206 and @xmath207 respectively , approaching vortex sizes resolvable in experiments @xcite .",
    "note that at later times the @xmath113 condensate density near to the center is relatively uniform , which could provide a means to differentiate between different @xmath67 states experimentally . for a uniform condensate",
    "the radius of the vortex core at half - maximum density can be found numerically @xcite yielding values of @xmath208 and @xmath209 for @xmath175 and @xmath193 .",
    "this factor of two difference is reproduced in our simulations , which at @xmath210 yield vortex radii at half - maximum of @xmath211 and @xmath212 for @xmath175 and @xmath193 respectively . using the predicted value @xmath213 , from the measured peak density ,",
    "yields good estimates for the vortex radii .",
    "so in experiments , by measuring the vortex core sizes and using simple theoretical relations , one could determine whether either a singly or a doubly quantized vortex is present @xcite . in general , the larger the vorticity , the wider will be the central hole at a given instant after release from the trap .",
    "however , the quantitative measurement of large vorticity values could in practice be limited by the longer expansion times needed to yield a wide enough central plateau , the corresponding reduction in density making the experimental imaging difficult .    fig .",
    "[ fig : threepan ] shows the 2d density profile at @xmath210 for @xmath113 , @xmath175 and @xmath193 , which would be similar to the absorption images typically found in experiments .",
    "as well as showing the density profiles are circularly - symmetric , it also illustrates the large differences between the images , which adds qualitative support to the idea that it should be relatively simple to distinguish between different vortex states after expansion .",
    "it is important to note that the central plateau is a consequence of repulsive interatomic forces , and for free expansion with no interactions a more sharply peaked distribution is found . in this latter case",
    "the condensate wavefunction is given by the analytical expression @xcite @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the dimensionality , so in this case @xmath216 .",
    "note also that we have returned to using physical units . at large times , @xmath217 , the density of the expanded condensate is circularly symmetric and tends towards @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the momentum distribution of the condensate .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "a final method for vortex detection involves considering the momentum distribution of the condensate , which could be probed experimentally by switching off interactions during expansion ( e.g.  by exploiting a feshbach resonance ) as discussed in the previous section , or by bragg spectroscopy _ via _ the dynamic structure factor @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the momentum distribution @xmath220 is obtained by fourier transforming the equilibrium wavefunction @xmath221 . after integrating over the angular coordinate ( i.e.  performing a hankel transform ) one obtains @xmath222 where we have taken the modulus to remove constant phase factors , and @xmath223 is the bessel function of order @xmath67 .",
    "as we have already seen , for small @xmath67 one can approximate the equilibrium density in position space with the tf profile ( [ eq : density ] ) . in this case",
    "the integral can be rewritten in terms of the variable @xmath114 as @xmath224 the limit of this integral for a narrow annulus ( @xmath103 ) is of particular interest .",
    "a series expansion of the bessel function in powers of @xmath38 then gives the simple result @xmath225 \\ , , \\label{eq : fourier - bess}\\ ] ] where @xmath226 is the radius of the annulus .",
    "note that odd powers of @xmath38 disappear due to parity and that the accuracy of this expansion decreases for large @xmath227 .",
    "[ fig : momdist ] shows the cylindrically - symmetric momentum distributions @xmath219 for @xmath113 and @xmath175 and previously used parameters @xmath158 , @xmath160 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier - gen ] ) , where the wavefunction is found by solving the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation , while the dashed line plots the tf result ( [ eq : fourier - tf ] ) .",
    "these are scaled for comparison to the bessel function @xmath228 .",
    "one sees that the bessel function closely approximates the tf result at small momenta , with differences appearing at larger @xmath229 .",
    "further calculations show that the agreement degrades for larger @xmath38 , as would be expected , although it is still reasonably good for @xmath230 .",
    "there is also a significant difference between the tf and full gp solutions , mostly in the amplitudes of the peaks .",
    "this is despite the fact that @xmath231 so the condition for the validity of the tf approximation is well satisfied .",
    "crucially , however , the positions of the minima and maxima of the momentum distribution are relatively insensitive to the details of the wavefunction . in particular , for both @xmath113 and @xmath175",
    "the first few zeros and maxima of @xmath219 from the gp solution agree well with the roots of the corresponding bessel functions and their derivatives . by virtue of this close correspondence , the positions of these peaks and troughs could provide a means to measure vorticity in experiments .",
    "for example , the first maximum could be particularly useful , since its position shifts to higher @xmath227 as @xmath67 increases .",
    "we have studied a dilute bose - einstein condensate in a `` mexican hat '' trapping potential of quartic minus quadratic form .",
    "we use the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation to analytically find the equilibrium properties of both non - rotating and rotating condensates , and compare to numerical solutions of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "in particular , we find that a non - rotating condensate has an annular structure , with a hole in the center , for @xmath40 , where @xmath232 .",
    "we also find that for condensates in a frame rotating at sufficiently low angular velocities a stable multiply - quantized vortex with circulation @xmath148 is present at the center . at higher angular velocities",
    "our gross - pitaevskii simulations show that the ground state can instead consist of a centered multiply - quantized vortex surrounded by rings of singly - quantized vortices , some of which are visible within the annulus .",
    "we have also investigated the dynamics of a condensate with and without a multiply - quantized vortex , particularly the collective modes .",
    "a hydrodynamic equation was derived within the tf approximation , with solutions that agree well with the results of evolving the gp equation for large interaction strengths and numbers of atoms where the tf approximation is expected to be valid .",
    "we find that for a non - rotating condensate in the limit of a thin annulus ( @xmath41 ) the mode frequencies are @xmath233 , where the number of radial nodes @xmath234 defines families of modes containing different angular quantum numbers @xmath118 . in this limit modes with the same @xmath235 but different @xmath118 are degenerate , but",
    "diverge as one increases @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath132 family for @xmath133 are low - lying modes corresponding to sound waves directed around the annulus .",
    "thus a simple analytical expression for their frequencies can be derived from @xmath136 , where @xmath144 is the speed of sound , and @xmath236 with @xmath226 the radius of the annulus , giving @xmath237 .",
    "the mode frequencies in the presence of a multiply - quantized vortex were also analyzed , where it was found that the frequency difference between opposite @xmath118 modes in the rotating frame is much smaller than the splitting introduced when transforming to the laboratory frame , especially for the low - lying modes .",
    "the possibility of using this splitting for experimental detection of vorticity is explored , in particular the excitation of low - lying @xmath238 modes in a thin annulus .",
    "although in theory the splitting could be observable as a `` precession '' of the mode around the annulus , the practicality of this technique may be limited due to the difficulty of observing the associated small density fluctuations .",
    "hence , as an alternative method we also investigated the free expansion of the condensate after release from the trap .",
    "we found that the hole in the annulus tends to be filled during the expansion , meaning that a vortex is clearly discernible as a hole in the expanded density profile .",
    "as a consequence of the repulsive interactions , the density of the expanded cloud is relatively uniform near to the center , allowing the width of the vortex core to be used as a measure of the vorticity .    in contrast ,",
    "when interactions are switched off during the expansion we find that the central density is less uniform , and at long times it tends towards the momentum distribution of the condensate . since the momentum distribution can be also probed by bragg spectroscopy , we have explored the possibility of using such a measurement to detect vortex states .",
    "we find that for thin annuli in the thomas - fermi approximation the distribution takes the form @xmath239 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "fourier transforming the stationary solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation changes the amplitudes , but not the positions , of the peaks , potentially allowing the minima of an experimentally measured momentum distribution to be compared to the zeros of the bessel function in order to distinguish different @xmath67 states .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that most of the results obtained in the thin annulus limit are expected to be valid for generic ring - shaped condensates , independent of the specific form of the trapping potential .",
    "in particular , near to the minimum a generic mexican hat potential can be approximated by a harmonic well in the radial coordinate , allowing a precise mapping onto the results for our quartic minus quadratic potential .",
    "the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hd lin no rot ] ) can be formally written as a series expansion in powers of @xmath38 , i.e.   @xmath241 , @xmath242 , where the functions @xmath243 are polynomials of order @xmath244 and parity @xmath245 . keeping terms up to @xmath246 , for the most interesting cases @xmath247 one has @xmath248 and @xmath249 , with the corresponding phase variations @xmath250{e}^{im\\phi}$ ] and @xmath251{e}^{im\\phi}$ ] .        at the leading order in @xmath38 and for small angular velocities , where @xmath252 , the quadrupole operator is @xmath253\\cos(2\\phi)/(2\\lambda )   = ( \\delta{n}_{0,+2}+\\delta{n}_{0,-2})/(4\\lambda)+\\mathcal{o }   ( \\eta)$ ] , mainly exciting the @xmath254 modes .",
    "the ( @xmath255 ) modes , whose excitation amplitude is proportional to @xmath38 , are responsible for the small - amplitude high - frequency oscillations visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq5](b ) .",
    "experimentally , one could realize a purely 2d expansion by retaining the confinement in the axial direction .",
    "a full 3d expansion , inducing a lowering of the effective 2d coupling constant , would enhance the increase of the healing length , changing the scaling of the vortex core radius .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior , and in particular the factor of two difference between the vortex radii for @xmath113 and @xmath175 , is expected to be preserved ."
