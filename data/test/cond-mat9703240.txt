    "strontium titanate has been the subject of ongoing theoretical and experimental investigation for over 30 years , due to its unusual properties . in cubic perovskite structure knbo@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 , transitions to ferroelectric phases",
    "occur as the temperature is lowered .",
    "srtio@xmath0 , which has the same high - temperature structure , behaves somewhat differently in that it undergoes an antiferrodistortive ( afd ) transition as the temperature drops below about 105  k@xcite .",
    "this is due to a softening of the lowest frequency triply degenerate zone - corner r - point vibrational mode of lowest energy@xcite . in this mode ,",
    "the sr and ti atoms remain fixed , while the oxygen octahedra rotate about one of the cubic axes passing through the ti atom .",
    "the sense of the rotation is opposite in adjacent cells in all directions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as the temperature continues to drop below the afd transition",
    ", there is a sharp rise in the value of the static dielectric constant .",
    "this increase appears to follow a curie - weiss law consistent with an impending ferroelectric ( fe ) transition at about 20  k. with decreasing temperature , however , the static dielectric constant saturates at a high value , and the material does not become ferroelectric even at the lowest temperatures@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the fe transition is inhibited due to quantum paraelectric behavior , in which the zero - point motion of the atoms suppresses the long - range fe order@xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interest to characterize the structural instabilities of srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the present work is concerned with the wavevector dependence of structural instabilities in srtio@xmath0 , obtained from first - principles calculations , and their interpretation in light of previous similar calculations on knbo@xmath0 .",
    "our calculations are carried out utilizing the lapw formalism@xcite , wherein the wave functions , charge density , and potential all have dual representations . within non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres ,",
    "these quantities are expanded as numerical radial functions times spherical harmonics , while in the interstitual region , a plane wave representation is used .",
    "this method has several attractive features , such as employing an unbiased representation in the interstitual region and the ability to easily treat first - row and d - band atoms .",
    "the major drawback presented by this method is the use of position - dependent basis functions .",
    "this introduces correction terms when computing such quantities as the forces on the atoms@xcite , and thus complicates the computer programs . in order to investigate all possible soft phonon modes in a particular substance",
    ", we must map out the dispersion curves throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "this is accomplished quite easily using linear response theory@xcite . in linear response theory ,",
    "the total variational energy is expanded to second order as a function of the equilibrium charge density and the first - order change in the charge density : @xmath1 + \\lambda e^{(1)}[\\rho^{(0 ) } ] +          \\lambda^2 e^{(2)}[\\rho^{(1 ) } ] + \\cdots.\\ ] ] minimizing this energy with respect to the first - order change in the charge density yields a pair of equations which must be solved self - consistently : @xmath2 @xmath3 \\biggl )    \\psi_i^{(0)}.\\ ] ] the equations are the first - order analogs of the usual local density approximation ( lda ) equations , i.e. this is an exact theory ; there are no approximations beyond lda .",
    "the dynamical matrix elements for a given wavevector @xmath4 are found via the first - order forces .",
    "the forces on all the atoms are calculated for at most 3n selected atomic displacements at each wavevector , where n is the number of atoms in the primitive cell . to map the phonon dispersion curves throughout the brillouin zone",
    ", we compute the dynamical matrix on a uniform grid of q - points .",
    "the short - range real - space force constants are then obtained by fourier transform , after subtracting out the analytic long - range dipolar contribution . by inverse",
    "fourier transform , adding in the long - range part , we may compute the dynamical matrix at an arbitrary q - point .",
    "for the srtio@xmath0 calculations , we have used a 6@xmath56@xmath56 mesh of q - points . exploiting symmetry",
    ", we had to compute the dynamical matrix at only 20 q - points in the irreducible bz wedge .",
    "typically , at each q - point , 3n=15 self - consistent calculations were performed .",
    "the electronic contribution to the static dielectric constant , @xmath6 , is determined from the induced potential : @xmath7.\\ ] ] the macroscopic polarization at long wavelength is given by the first order change in the charge density @xmath8 and from this we can compute the born effective charges @xmath9 here , z@xmath10 is the ionic contribution , and the second term is the unit cell volume times the derivative of the polarization with respect to displacements of the atoms at zero electric field .",
    "we first performed self - consistent total - energy calculations in the cubic phase to determine the equilibrium properties .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists the theoretical lattice parameters and bulk moduli for the present work , along with those of king - smith and vanderbilt @xcite , as well as some experimental values .",
    "our calculated lattice parameter is only 0.4% larger than the experimental value , so we have used the theoretical value in the following calculations .",
    "the electronic component of the static dielectric constant , @xmath6 , was found to be 6.63 , which is about 28% larger than an experimental value of 5.18 .",
    "this kind of overestimation of @xmath6 is typical of lda calculations@xcite .",
    "table  [ table2 ] lists the born effective charges ( z@xmath11 ) for each type of atom . for sr and ti ,",
    "the values are isotropic , while for the o atoms , there are two distinctive values  for displacements along and perpendicular to the ti - o bonds , labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . also listed are the results of calculations by zhong , king - smith , and vanderbilt@xcite .",
    "respective theoretical lattice parameters were used for the calculations . note the anomalously large values for z@xmath14(ti ) and z@xmath14(o)@xmath15 due to strong covalent interactions between these atoms@xcite .",
    "we find that our results are generally in good agreement with those of zhong _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "table  [ table3 ] compares our zone - center optic phonon frequencies with planewave pseudopotential frozen phonon calculations and experimental data .",
    "both calculations find unstable transverse optic ( to ) modes at the @xmath16-point with imaginary frequencies .",
    "the longitudinal optic ( lo ) mode frequencies were obtained using @xmath17 where _",
    "d_@xmath18 is the zone - center dynamical matrix without macroscopic field , * z@xmath19 * and m@xmath20 are the born effective charge tensor and mass for atom @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the volume of the unit cell , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are cartesian indices , and @xmath25 is a unit wavevector .",
    "the results of zhong , king - smith , and vanderbilt were determined using @xmath6=5.18 from experiment , whereas we used our larger calculated value of 6.63 . to determine what effect @xmath6 has on the lo mode eigenvalues , a second calculation was performed using @xmath6=5.18 .",
    "the highest lo mode is most sensitive , changing from 751 to 832 @xmath26 , while the other two are fairly insensitive .",
    "we present the calculated phonon dispersion curves for cubic srtio@xmath0 plotted along high - symmetry directions in fig .",
    "the @xmath16x , @xmath16 m , and @xmath16r lines correspond to the @xmath27100@xmath28 , @xmath27110@xmath28 , and @xmath27111@xmath28 directions , respectively .",
    "imaginary frequencies are represented by negative values .",
    "the character of the modes at the zone - center and zone - boundaries has been labeled according to the notation by cowley@xcite .",
    "the form of some of our lower dispersion curves for the @xmath16 m and @xmath16r directions is roughly in accordance with data reported by shirane and yamada at 120  k@xcite , including an apparent softening of a mode at the r - point .",
    "similar behavior is seen at the m - point , but the lowest zone - boundary phonon mode m@xmath0 was reported as being temperature - independent through the afd transition .",
    "since we are mainly concerned with structural instabilities and how they relate to the observed phase transitions , we will focus on the portions of the dispersion curves which lie below the @xmath29=0 dashed line in fig .",
    "note the large phase space for unstable modes .",
    "our calculations indicate unstable modes at the r - point ( r@xmath30 ) , zone - center ( @xmath31 ) , and m - point ( m@xmath0 ) .",
    "these instabilities are of two types : fe ( @xmath31 ) , and afd ( r@xmath30 and m@xmath0 ) . in the @xmath31 to mode , ti atoms move parallel to one of the ti - o bonds , and the oxygen octahedra move in the opposite direction .",
    "this mode is responsible for the fe transitions in materials like batio@xmath0 and knbo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the m@xmath0 mode is nearly identical to the r@xmath30 mode in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with one exception .",
    "the rotation of the octahedra is in the @xmath32 sense in neighboring cells along the vertical c - axis , but remains opposite in the horizontally adjacent cells",
    ". the dispersion curves of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show @xmath33 , suggesting that lda may find a fe structure ( rhombohedral ? ) to be lower in energy than the afd tetragonal structure .",
    "of course experimentally there is no observed transition from afd to fe phase , although it is seen in the monte carlo simulations of zhong and vanderbilt@xcite .",
    "recently , they have included quantum fluctuation effects into these simulations , and find the fe transition completely suppressed@xcite .",
    "the regions of instability in the bz are better visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in which isosurfaces , corresponding to @xmath29=0 , are shown for the lowest unstable phonon modes .",
    "the cubic bz , with @xmath16 at the center , is also shown .",
    "the inner isosurface is centered at the @xmath16-point , and can be visualized as three interpenetrating `` cookies '' , one perpendicular to each cartesian direction .",
    "the region of fe - type instability is interior to this first isosurface . between the first and the second isosurface , which lies near the zone edges , all modes are stable .",
    "thus unstable modes are present along the entire r - m - r edge of the bz . in a repeated - zone scheme",
    ", this isosurface would appear as narrow cylindrical tubes extending from r - m - r .",
    "we now discuss the current work in light of results for similar calculations on cubic knbo@xmath0 by yu and krakauer@xcite .",
    "the dispersion curves of knbo@xmath0 also reveal a large region of instability for the lowest modes .",
    "in contrast to srtio@xmath0 , a soft mode is present at the x - point , and the lowest r - point mode is stable . although m - point instabilities exist for both materials , the character of these modes is quite different . in knbo@xmath0",
    "the motion of the atoms is the same as for the zone - center @xmath31 mode with the exception that two o atoms perpedicular to the motion remain fixed , i.e. it is essentially the `` ferroelectric '' soft mode . in srtio@xmath0 ,",
    "the motion is a rotation of the octahedra as described above . a similar @xmath29=0 isosurface plot for knbo@xmath0 shows that the fe instability extends from the zone - center all the way to the zone - boundary within planar slab - like regions .",
    "an afd instablility was not present in the knbo@xmath0 calculations .",
    "notice that in srtio@xmath0 , the large planar regions of fe instability have shrunk down to three interpenetrating `` cookies '' , and the phase space corresponding to the fe character is greatly reduced .",
    "because the regions of instability in knbo@xmath0 reside in slabs which extend across the entire bz , any linear combination of phonon modes within one of these regions will also be unstable . in a real - space picture ,",
    "unstable atomic chain - like structures can develop , where the nb atoms are all displaced in the same direction@xcite .",
    "the width of the slab - like regions in knbo@xmath0 indicates the length of the shortest such chains to be about 5 lattice parameters@xcite . we can perform a similar qualitative analysis of the real - space motion of the atoms in srtio@xmath0 from its isosurface plot .",
    "since there exists a continuous instability extending from r - m - r , linear combinations of phonon modes along this cylindrical tube - like region will also be unstable .",
    "the character of modes along the zone edges is one of rotating oxygen octahedra ; thus , an unstable thin disk or planar region could form in real space wherein the octahedra are rotated in opposite senses in neighboring cells , with the surrounding regions remaining undisplaced . from the width of the cylinders containing the instability",
    ", we estimate the smallest radius of the real - space disks to be approximately 35 lattice parameters . because of the sensitive dependence of the soft modes on volume , it is possible that these cylinders may pinch off at the m - point at slightly reduced volumes .",
    "we have not investigated this yet .",
    "in summary , we performed first - principles linear response calculations of the wavevector dependence of structural instabilities for cubic srtio@xmath0 . in comparison with previous work on knbo@xmath0 , we notice three differences .",
    "first , calculations on knbo@xmath0 show a ferroelectric - type instability only , while srtio@xmath0 calculations exhibit both fe and afd instabilities .",
    "second , the phase space of the two - dimensional fe instability ( corresponding to chains in real space ) is greatly reduced and no longer extends to the zone - edges as in knbo@xmath0 , but is restricted to the interior of a region likened to three inter - penetrating `` cookies '' .",
    "third , the afd instability occupies a rather large region of phase space extending along the entire bz edges in cylindrical tubes .",
    "the essentially 1-d character of these tubes corresponds to real - space planar instabilities characterized by rotations of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "future calculations for srtio@xmath0 in the tetragonal phase ( below the afd transition ) will be required in order to investigate any instabilities  especially ferroelectric instabilities  that persist .",
