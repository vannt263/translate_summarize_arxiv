    "iron - based high-@xmath0 superconductors@xcite have a complex fermi surface that is determined by several bands , an effect resulting from the hybridization of the @xmath1 orbitals of iron.@xcite band structure calculations have shown that the bands that define the two hole pockets around the @xmath2 point have mostly @xmath3 and @xmath4 character , while the two electron pockets around the m point have @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and a smaller amount of @xmath6 contributions.@xcite for this reason it is important to understand superconductivity in multiorbital systems in general terms .    among the first to address this complex problem several years ago were suhl _",

    "thus , in this case each band was determined by one single orbital .",
    "they showed that bcs pairing@xcite could occur in each band and , since in the most general case the electron - phonon interaction would have different strengths for electrons in the different bands , it was proposed that two different superconducting gaps could arise .",
    "almost 50 years were needed to observe experimental evidence of this phenomenon . in 2001 , superconductivity with @xmath9  k was observed in mgb@xmath10.@xcite despite the high-@xmath11 , it became clear that the bcs mechanism@xcite was at play and for the first time two different superconducting gaps were observed.@xcite as shown in ref .",
    ", the fermi surface ( fs ) is determined by two bands : the @xmath12 band formed by the @xmath13 orbitals of b , and the @xmath14 band constituted by a linear combination of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 b - orbitals .",
    "although three orbitals determine the fs , it is interesting to notice that only two different bcs gaps are observed .",
    "this occurs because two of the three orbitals hybridize with each other and determine one single band , which couples strongly to the lattice phonons .",
    "this opens a large superconducting gap on the @xmath14 fs .",
    "the other orbital , @xmath13 , does not hybridize and forms the @xmath12 band that couples weakly to the lattice phonons determining a second , smaller , superconducting gap at the fs of the @xmath12 band .",
    "thus , the number of different gaps that can arise in a multiorbital system is related to the degree of hybridization among the orbitals .",

    "interband hopping of pairs of electrons belonging to the same band was included _ but the possibility of interband pairing , i.e. , _ pairs formed by electrons belonging to two different bands _ , was not considered .    in this paper , the subject of superconductivity in multiorbital systems",
    "is revisited , in particular to shed light on the possible symmetry of the pairing operator of the pnictides superconductors .",
    "the motivation is that the pairing operators that have been discussed the most thus far@xcite assume that only intraband pairing should occur , namely the two electrons of the cooper pair belong to the same band.@xcite however , numerical simulations@xcite performed on a two - orbital model@xcite for the pnictides favor an interorbital pairing operator that , when transformed to the band representation , results not only in intraband pairing but it includes interband pairing as well.@xcite for the pnictides , interband hopping of pairs formed between electrons in _ the same _ band is often denoted as `` interband superconductivity''.@xcite the situation discussed in the present paper is _ different _ and involves cooper pairs where the two electrons come from two different bands , which we will call `` interband pairing '' . using symmetry arguments and mean - field approximations ,",
    "the plausibility and physical meaning of such an interband pairing in multiorbital systems will be discussed .",
    "interband pairing has previously been addressed in the context of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and cold atoms,@xcite heavy fermions,@xcite cuprates@xcite , and bcs superconductivity.@xcite in the case of heavy fermions , it was argued that interband pairing could occur if two fermi surfaces arising from different bands are very close to one other,@xcite while in qcd and cold atoms it was presented as a possibility for the case of sufficiently strong attractive pairing interactions , or for weaker attractions among particles with very different masses.@xcite as it will be discussed for a simple model in sec .",

    "[ regimes ] , can result from a purely interband pairing as a function of the strength of the pairing potential @xmath17 : ( 1 ) a normal regime where the ground state is not superconducting ( namely in purely interband pairing an infinitesimal attraction does not lead to superconductivity ) , ( 2 ) an exotic superconducting `` breached '' regime where gaps open at the normal fermi surfaces while new fermi surfaces defining regions containing unpaired electrons are created , and ( 3 ) a superconducting regime resembling bcs states , at large attractive coupling.@xcite     of an interband pairing attraction .",
    "the label `` normal '' denotes a non - superconducting state .",
    "the case `` breached '' is an exotic regime with superconductivity and gaps , coexisting with fermi surfaces ( or several nodes ) and electrons that do not pair .",

    "[ sec : pairings ] , the general form of pairing operators in multiorbital systems will be presented , remarking how the symmetry is determined by the spatial and the orbital characteristics of the operator .",
    "the interorbital pairing operator with @xmath18 symmetry obtained numerically in a two - orbital model for the pnictides is discussed , emphasizing that this operator presents a mixture of intra and interband pairing in the band representation . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in single - orbital models , the symmetry of a spin - singlet pairing state is completely determined by the properties of its spatial form factor .",
    "more specifically , the pairing operator will have the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 destroys an electron with momentum @xmath22 and spin projection @xmath14 and @xmath23 is the form factor that transforms according to one of the irreducible representations of the crystal s symmetry group .",
    "thus , @xmath23 determines the symmetry of the operator .",
    "these form factors depend on the lattice geometry and generally they may be very complex . however , in materials with short pair coherence lengths , such as the high-@xmath0 cuprates , the assumption that the two particles that form the pair can be very close to one other is usually made .",
    "the cu - oxide planes in the cuprates have the symmetry properties of the @xmath24 group and the case @xmath25 , which transforms according to the irreducible representation @xmath26 , provides the well - known @xmath8-wave symmetry pairing .    in multiorbital systems , on the other hand",
    ", a spin singlet pairing operator will have both spatial and orbital degrees of freedom and it will be given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 destroys an electron with momentum @xmath22 , in orbital @xmath29 , and with spin projection @xmath14 , @xmath23 is the spatial form factor as indicated above , and @xmath30 is a matrix in the space spanned by the orbitals involved . the dimension of @xmath31 is equal to the number of orbitals that are considered to be of relevance . in this case ,",
    "notice that the symmetry of the pairing operator would in general be determined by the product of the symmetry properties of @xmath32 and the symmetry of the orbital contribution @xmath30 .",
    "only if @xmath30 is the identity matrix do the orbital contribution become trivial , because the identity matrix transforms according to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , this is the only case where @xmath23 fully determines the symmetry of the pairing operator , as in the single - orbital example .",
    "the minimum model for the pnictides considers the two orbitals @xmath5 and @xmath4 , which are strongly hybridized.@xcite all the possible pairing operators , up to nearest - neighbor distance , that are allowed by the lattice and orbital symmetries have been already calculated.@xcite numerical simulations performed on the two - orbital model suggest that the favored pairing operator at intermediate couplings , where the state is both magnetic and metallic ,  @xcite has symmetry @xmath18 and is given by eq .",

    "thus , the non - trivial symmetry under rotations arises from the orbital portion of the operator .",
    "this pairing operator has been studied at the mean - field level in ref .  .",
    "in the orbital representation , the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian matrix is given by : @xmath37 with    @xmath38    and @xmath39 where @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being the strength of the pairing interaction and @xmath42 the mean - field parameter obtained by minimizing the energy .",
    "since the two orbitals are hybridized via @xmath43 , in the band representation the hamiltonian matrix becomes : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the elements of the change of basis matrix @xmath51 given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "remember that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are functions of the momentum @xmath22 , and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , it is clear that in the band representation , in addition to the intraband pairing given by @xmath45 , there is also interband pairing given by @xmath46 . among pairing operators compatible with the symmetry of the model ,",
    "the ones that do not lead to interband pairing not only can not mix orbitals , but have to contain @xmath55 , i.e. , the identity matrix.@xcite one example for such an operator would be the @xmath56 pairing.@xcite    the discussion above describes general properties of hybridized multi - orbital systems . if the orbitals are hybridized , but not related to one another by symmetry , there is no reason to expect that the coupling between the electrons in each orbital , and the interaction that produces the pairing , will have the same strength for all the orbitals and lead to a unit matrix in the orbital sector .",
    "then , it is expected that interband pairing will arise in general and , thus , it is important to understand its consequences , providing the main motivation for the present manuscript .",
    "to address qualitatively the issue of interband pairing , postponing the matters of stability to the next subsection ( sec .",

    "that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcs_ours ] ) has arisen from an interorbital attractive potential of the form @xmath219 and that @xmath220 where @xmath221     for different values of the attraction @xmath222 as a function of @xmath223.[fig : ebg],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is then given by @xmath223 and the mean - field energy @xmath157 can be calculated for a given @xmath222 as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebg ] . in this figure",
    ", a minimum for @xmath158 can be seen for @xmath224 .",
    "this indicates that if the pairing attraction overcomes a finite threshold level , the mean field results presented here with @xmath225 will be stable .",
    "thus , _ if the attraction exists , both multinodal ( breached ) and states with nodes only along x - y ( strong coupling ) are possible . _",
    "summarizing , in this manuscript the possibility of intra and interband pairing in multiorbital systems has been discussed .",
    "while interband pairing has previously been studied in the context of qcd , cold atoms,@xcite heavy fermions,@xcite cuprates@xcite , and bcs superconductivity,@xcite most of the pairing operators proposed for the pnictides are based on the premise that the pairing has to be purely intraband , i.e. , both electrons in the cooper pairs belonging to the same band , compatible with the assumption that in these superconductors all the action must occur at the fermi surfaces .",
    "however , symmetry considerations show that in models for the pnictides interorbital pairing is allowed with the two members of the cooper pair belonging to different bands.@xcite this is not surprising since the bands that determine the electron and hole fermi surfaces consist of hybridized orbitals . these interorbital pairing operators give rise to not only intra but also interband pairing when the band representation is used .",
    "in addition , numerical calculations in a minimal two orbital model for the pnictides favor one of these non - trivial pairing operators.@xcite as a consequence , a clear discussion of the role of interband pairing is necessary .",
    "the explicit calculations shown here of the electronic occupation in the orbital and the band representations , as well as the calculation of the spectral functions showing the distribution of bogoliubov bands , may offer guidance in the interpretation of arpes experiments .",
    "in particular , most arpes measurements determine the fs in the normal state and study the opening of the superconducting gap by monitoring @xmath226 as they lower the temperature.@xcite notice that this approach would miss the nodes associated with the `` breached '' phase since in the superconducting state a gap would be observed in @xmath226 while the node would be detected in @xmath227 .",
    "thus , experimentalists should investigate the possibility of nodes at points in momentum space that do not belong to the normal state fs and they must keep in mind that some of the nodes may be determined by shadow bands with very small spectral weight .    the most recent experimental results with the polarization dependence of the arpes spectra for bafe@xmath228co@xmath229as@xmath10 provided the allowed contribution of each of the five @xmath1 orbitals to the electron and hole fermi surfaces.@xcite while discrepancies with proposed four and five orbital models are remarked in that publication , it is interesting to observe that the minimal two - orbital model addressed here does not contradict the arpes findings if we disregard the additional @xmath230 hole pocket fs that they present , which is reasonable because it has @xmath231 character , an orbital not included in the minimal model considered here .",
    "in fact , along their @xmath193 direction , which corresponds to our @xmath196 , our first hole fs is purely @xmath5 as it is their @xmath232 hole fs ; our second hole fs , which arises upon folding our extended fs along @xmath191 is purely @xmath4 , as it is their @xmath233 hole fs , and our electron fs is purely @xmath4 as it is their @xmath234 electron fs .",
    "our second electron fs ( obtained upon folding ) has a purely @xmath5 character , while their electron fs @xmath235 appears to be mostly @xmath4 and @xmath6 , but with some amounts of @xmath5 as well .",
    "along the diagonal direction @xmath196 , which corresponds to our @xmath193 , the two hole fermi surfaces are a symmetric admixture of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , exactly as in the two - orbital model.@xcite thus , these similarities between the experimental results and the band composition of the simple two - orbital model offer encouragement towards exploring whether the main physics of the pnictides can be captured with such a minimum number of degrees of freedom .    we have also mentioned in the text that the symmetry of the lattice and of the orbitals introduce constraints on the possible pairing operators . in general , a purely intraband pairing , such as the proposed @xmath236 state,@xcite would occur only if the coupling of the electrons with the source of the attraction is _ identical _ for all orbitals . considering the different spatial orientations of the orbitals ,",
    "it is not obvious that this should be the case , since , as discussed in the introduction , phonons couple differently to electrons in the @xmath13 and @xmath15 boron orbitals in the case of mgb@xmath10 .",
    "thus , if indeed the coupling results to be the same for all @xmath1 orbitals we could use this fact to elucidate the pairing mechanism ; but , if this is not the case , we would expect some degree of interband pairing , at least in some regions of the brillouin zone and , thus , it is important to study the experimental and theoretical consequences of such a possibility .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in the undoped limit there are also three regimes : normal , coexisting magnetism and metallicity , and magnetism without a fermi surface .",
