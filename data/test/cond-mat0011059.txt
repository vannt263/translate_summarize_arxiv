    "if bloch electrons encounter planar interfaces they may be reflected or transmitted . in this paper",
    "we develop a technique for the calculation of these reflection and transmission amplitudes within the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( screened kkr ) approach , a technique for ab initio electronic structure calculations .",
    "there are many uses for bloch wave transmission and reflection amplitudes and probabilities .",
    "first of all they can be applied to describe transport @xcite in films and multilayers including the electronic structure of the real material .",
    "secondly , they can be used do develop a first principle based theory of electron tunneling . finally , transmission and reflection coefficients are the basic ingredients for the theoretical understanding of interlayer exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "consider an arbitrary barrier @xmath2 which is sandwiched by two leads of the material @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for the propagating bulk - states in @xmath3",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath0 through the barrier is defined as @xmath4 where the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the complex amplitudes of the right- and left - moving bloch waves . during the scattering process the energy @xmath7 and the in - plane component @xmath8 of the wave vector @xmath9 are conserved .    in the past different methods",
    "were established for the calculation of @xmath0 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these methods usually model the structure of the two semi - infinite leads @xmath1 separated by a barrier @xmath2 . via the green s function or the wave function of the system",
    "@xmath0 can be computed . in this work we present a new method which approaches the problem differently",
    ": we use the band structure and wave function of a periodic superlattice @xmath2/@xmath1 to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "this is strongly motivated by the development of highly efficient n - scaling superlattice kkr codes , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a superlattice is a structure @xmath2/@xmath1 which is periodically repeated in all three dimensions ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . therefore",
    "the case of the single barrier @xmath2 with leads @xmath1 is fully contained in this structure and the similarity with the kronig - penney model is obvious .",
    "kronig and penney showed in their simple 1-dimensional free electron model how the bandstructure of a periodic system can be derived from the scattering properties of a single barrier .",
    "( for more details on the kronig - penney model see for instance @xcite . )",
    "the keynote of this paper is to derive the scattering properties of a single barrier from the electronic structure of a superlattice .",
    "we discuss the theory and numericalimplementation of the new method and present its first successful applications to free electrons and a cu / co ( 001 ) system .",
    "first we state our basic assumptions .",
    "thereafter we discuss the transmission coefficient @xmath0 of the single barrier and finally its connection to the superlattice wave function .      in fig .",
    "1 and fig . 2 schematic pictures of a single barrier and a superlattice are presented . note that @xmath10 is always perpendicular to the barrier @xmath2 , the other two components are denoted with @xmath11 . along @xmath12 the leads @xmath1 and the barrier @xmath2",
    "show the same 2-dimensional periodicity .",
    "the superlattice , however , is also periodic in @xmath10-direction .    the single barrier case ( see fig . 1 ) consists of the barrier and two semi - infinite leads . in difference to the common understanding",
    ", we will include the perturbed interface regions of the leads into the barrier @xmath13 .",
    "the leads @xmath1 , however , consist of bulk - like potentials only . a superlattice",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 ) consists of an infinite number of barriers separated by interlayers .",
    "the barriers @xmath2 contain again the perturbed interface regions .",
    "the interlayers consist of bulk - like potentials , the same as in the leads @xmath1 of the single barrier case .",
    "furthermore , we assume energy- and @xmath8-conservation due to the elastic scattering and the in - plane symmetry of the system .",
    "since @xmath14 is conserved the problem can be treated as quasi 1-dimensional , but the reader should be cautious while keeping track of the components of the other two dimensions .",
    "we make two additional simplifications : first , the barrier is symmetric and , secondly , we restrict our considerations to one propagating bulk state @xmath15 at a given energy and @xmath14",
    ". that means , degeneration and band - crossing of bulk states in the leads are excluded .",
    "the wavefunction in the leads @xmath1 is a superposition of the right- and left - moving bulk states , since the solution of the schrdinger equation depends only on the local potential ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath16 @xmath17 denotes the two sides of the barrier .",
    "@xmath18 is the bloch function of the bulk system .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath19 into a phase factor and a periodic function is due to bloch s theorem with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bulk lattice parameter and @xmath22 an integer .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath24 on both sides of the barrier are related to each other by a transfer matrix @xmath25 which describes all the scattering processes inside the barrier : @xmath26    the four complex variables of this @xmath25-matrix are not independent from each other . due to time - reversal invariance , current conservation and the symmetry of the barrier",
    ", @xmath25 can be parametrized with two independent real parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the following form @xcite : @xmath29 therefore the relation @xmath30 is valid .    using the components of the transfer matrix",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath0 is by definition eq .",
    "( [ eg : def_t ] ) : @xmath31    obviously , the problem is solved if the eigenstates @xmath32 of such a single barrier are known .",
    "in contrast to the eigenfunctions of the single barrier ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavesingle ] ) ) the eigenfunctions of a superlattice @xmath32 are described by quantum numbers @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 is the superlattice wave vector in @xmath10-direction reflecting the prolonged lattice structure with the lattice constant @xmath35 , that is the length of the unit cell in @xmath10-direction .",
    "furthermore , the in - plane component @xmath8 is the same as in the bulk system since in - plane symmetry is conserved .",
    "the translational symmetry of @xmath36 in the superlattice direction is given by bloch s theorem : @xmath37 where the integer @xmath38 ranges from minus to plus infinity .",
    "let us now consider the superlattice as a periodic repetition of single barriers @xmath2 with the interlayer @xmath1 in between . in the interlayer",
    "the potential is bulk - like and therefore we can expand the superlattice wave function ( see eq .",
    "( [ eg : bloch ] ) ) as a superposition of right- and left - moving bloch functions of the bulk system in the cell @xmath39 @xmath40 : @xmath41 \\text { . }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the relation @xmath42 @xmath43 we can rewrite this into @xmath44   \\text { .}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the right- and left - moving bulk states are orthogonal we find @xmath45 on the other hand we can connect the amplitudes in different cells with the transfer matrix @xmath25 : @xmath46    we can combine eqs .",
    "( [ eg : com1 ] ) and ( [ eq : com2 ] ) to the eigenvalue equation @xmath47 with @xmath48    since @xmath49 is fully determined by the single eigenvalue @xmath50 and the corresponding eigenvector @xmath51 , we obtain the following algebraic set for @xmath27 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 thus , we are able to calculate @xmath0 for a given energy and @xmath54 knowing @xmath55 , @xmath34 and @xmath56 of the superlattice wave function @xmath36 and corresponding bulk state @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we explain how to extract @xmath55 and @xmath56 from @xmath58 in the interlayer , which is very similar to a fourier analysis of the @xmath59 . for the electronic band structure calculations we used a screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( screened kkr ) method .",
    "the screened kkr method ( see @xcite ) was developed for the selfconsistent calculation of the electronic structure .",
    "it is based on green s functions and the computation time scales linearly with the number of atoms in the unit cell .",
    "this allows the computation of systems with a relatively large number of atoms . for the atomic potentials the atomic sphere approximation ( asa )",
    "the superlattice wave function is expanded in terms of spherical solutions : @xmath60 the wave function in the leads as well : @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 is the lattice vector pointing to the @xmath63 unit cell , @xmath64 refers to the @xmath65 atom in the unit cell and @xmath66 is the space coordinate inside the @xmath65 atomic sphere .",
    "the @xmath67 are the spherical harmonics with the short hand notation @xmath68 , @xmath35 is the angular momentum and @xmath22 the magnetic quantum number .",
    "@xmath69 is the radial solution of the schrdinger equation in the @xmath65 atomic sphere .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the expansion coefficients , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the bloch vectors in the superlattice and in the bulk system , respectively .",
    "angular momenta up to @xmath74 were taken into account .",
    "as already explained , the superlattice wave function @xmath75 in the interlayer @xmath1 can be decomposed in right- and left - moving bloch waves @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath78 using the angular momentum expansions of eqs .",
    "( [ eg : defofcompcoeff ] ) and ( [ eq : def2 ] ) we can expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : decompos ] ) in the @xmath79 unit cell , which corresponds to @xmath80 : @xmath81 \\text { .}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we make use of the orthogonality relation of the @xmath82 and the following relations between the @xmath83 due to the real potential of the leads and bloch s theorem : @xmath84 so finally we conclude : @xmath85    we can exploit this equation at three different atomic positions @xmath86 in the interlayer and receive an algebraic set for @xmath55 and the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath88 cancel , so no additional computation of the bulk eigenstates of the leads is necessary .",
    "all we have to compute are the eigenstates of the superlattice @xmath89 for a given energy @xmath7 and in - plane wave vector @xmath90 which gives us the @xmath91 and @xmath34 . from here on we can calculate @xmath0 via eqs .",
    "( [ eg:2 ] ) and ( [ eq : algset ] ) . as a side effect",
    "we obtain the bandstructure @xmath92 of the lead material .",
    "this gives us the nice opportunity for an intermediate test of our method as we will see in the next section .",
    "still there is another problem we are faced with : if @xmath34 is complex the corresponding @xmath93 is evanescent which means it does not exist in the superlattice . in other words we are in a superlattice bandgap . but also",
    "in this energy range we want to calculate the corresponding @xmath55 and @xmath0 .",
    "one opportunity is the computation of the complex bandstructure and developing a similar formalism as the one described above .",
    "but usually the complex bandstructure is not available .",
    "another nice idea is to vary the interlayer thickness @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : the superlattice bandstructure gets stretched or squeezed on the energy axis comparable to the eigenstates of a square well . in this way we can scan the whole energy range , albeit it makes more than one superlattice calculation necessary .",
    "we followed this second idea .",
    "the results we discuss in this section demonstrate that our new method is working successfully .",
    "we considered the scattering of free electrons through a rectangular barrier , which is analytically solvable .",
    "furthermore we investigated the transmission of cu electrons through 5 monolayers ( ml ) co ( 001 ) , which we compared with the results of wildberger @xcite , who developed a different method for the computation of @xmath0 . in addition to the @xmath95-dependence we checked the dispersion relation @xmath96 of the lead material .",
    "outside the barrier we modelled an exact free electron gas with constant potential @xmath97 .",
    "the barrier itself consists of five layers with muffin tin ( mt ) spheres of a constant potential inside the sphere .",
    "the potential height is @xmath98 and they are arranged in an fcc lattice with a lattice constant of @xmath99 .",
    "this is only an approximate rectangular barrier , but the best one possible with asa potentials .    in fig .",
    "3 the dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath101 for @xmath102 is plotted .",
    "the analytical curve was fitted to the numerical data with a potential height of the rectangular barrier @xmath103 .",
    "this potential height is given by the dashed line .",
    "the factor @xmath104 is very close to @xmath105 which is the effective space filling of mt spheres on an fcc lattice .",
    "the remaining small difference of @xmath106 and also the subtle deviations in the @xmath95-dependence can be understood very well in terms of the different barrier shapes .",
    "the two numerical curves with the different interlayer thicknesses ( circle and plus ) coincide , which is a brilliant test for the validity of the method itself .",
    "the discontinuity of the curves is due to the superlattice bandgaps .",
    "obviously these gaps can be filled with different interlayer thicknesses @xmath107 . to fill all gaps more calculations with different interlayer thicknesses",
    "@xmath107 would be necessary .",
    "this is not done here since we just want to demonstrate the capability of our new method . for a short interpretation",
    "we notice that the electrons have a low transmission coefficient below the barrier since they have to tunnel through . above the barrier height",
    "they approach @xmath108 very rapidly , the oscillations are due to interference effects on the barrier interfaces .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the correspondence between the calculated dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath109 for different @xmath8 ( circle , cross and triangle ) and the expected free electron dispersion ( solid line ) , and obtain a very good agreement",
    ".      we arranged the co and cu on a fcc lattice with a lattice constant of @xmath110 .",
    "the value is larger than that of magnetic fcc co and smaller than that of fcc cu .",
    "the co layer consists of 5 ml .",
    "the potentials of the co layer and three cu layers at both sides of the barrier are taken from a self - consistent co@xmath111cu@xmath112 supercell calculation and form the barrier @xmath113 .",
    "the potential in the middle of the cu layer is a bulk - like cu asa potential .",
    "this approximation has no influence on the results and has the advantage that we can construct easily any cu interlayer thickness @xmath107 without doing an extra selfconsistent calculation .",
    "figure 5b and 5d show the @xmath95-dependence for @xmath114 in the majority and minority channels . since co is a ferromagnetic material the superlattice bandstructure of cu / co has no more spin - degeneracy and we obtain spin - splited majority and minority bands . as for the free electron results the curves for different interlayer thicknesses @xmath107 match , which is not shown explicitly here .",
    "large parts of the @xmath95-curve can be justified qualitatively by the band structure ( bs )  of co and cu , which are plotted in fig .",
    "5a ( co majority bs ) , fig .",
    "5c ( cu bs ) and fig .",
    "5e ( co minority bs ) .",
    "first we discuss the @xmath115-dependence in the majority channel ( see fig .",
    "5b ) :    since the co and cu states have the same symmetry character in the energy region * i * the cu electrons can propagate through the barrier very well , below the bottom of the co band they have to tunnel .",
    "therefore the behavior in section * i * is very similar to the free electron result as discussed in the previous subsection . in region * ii * there are no propagating cu bulk states and consequently there is no @xmath0 . in region",
    "* iii * we see that @xmath0 is almost free electron like again , the rapid breakdown at about 0.45 ryd corresponds the change of the symmetry character in the co bands .",
    "region * iv * has to be excluded from our discussion since the cu band structure is degenerated there and hence our method is not applicable . in region * v * , including the fermi level at @xmath116 , we obtain a @xmath0 of almost @xmath117 which is due to the corresponding band symmetries in co and cu .    in the minority channel ( see fig .",
    "5d ) we see two major differences to the majority channel in region * iii * and * v * : in region * iii * @xmath0 is almost zero since the co minority band has a gap there and so no band matching is possible between the cu and co states . in region",
    "* v * we see a low @xmath0 below 0.64 ryd .",
    "this is due to the upward shifted co bands in comparison to the majority channel and therefore no band matching between states with the same symmetry  character occurs .",
    "furthermore , we compare our results in the energy region * v * ( see fig .",
    "6a ) with the results obtained with a different method by wildberger @xcite ( see fig .",
    "6b ) , who used a semi - infinite structure with two co barriers at a certain distance ( which is comparable to our interlayer thickness @xmath107 ) for the calculation of the reflection coefficient @xmath118 .",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath119 is related to @xmath120 by @xmath121 . in fig .",
    "6b we see their @xmath122-dependence for the majority- and minority - channel ( dashed and solid line ) for @xmath123 around the fermi energy .",
    "the agreement with our own results shown in fig .",
    "6a is very good .",
    "slight differences are related to the different lattice parameters which were used .",
    "in addition , wildberger evaluates the green s function of the system for energies with a small imaginary part , which causes a broadening corresponding to a finite temperature .",
    "the agreement between our calculation and the calculation of wildberger is a confirmation of the capability and the validity of our new method .    in fig .",
    "7 we see the band structure of fcc cu along the line @xmath124 .",
    "the solid line is taken from a pure cu band structure calculation , the crosses denote the band structure @xmath92 extracted from the superlattice calculation .",
    "the region between the dashed lines corresponds to region * iv * in fig . 5 and has to be excluded for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "again , the correspondence between both curves is perfect .",
    "we presented a new method to calculate the transmission coefficient @xmath0 of bulk states through a single barrier from a superlattice band structure .",
    "its validity is fully confirmed by the successful test results . at this state",
    "the method is restricted to symmetric barriers and to only one propagating bulk state at a given energy and in plane wave vector .",
    "the generalization to the case of mor than one propagating bulk state and unsymmetric barriers is under development .",
