    "short clean one - dimensional ( 1d ) mesoscopic wires , often referred to as quantum point contacts , show conductance quantization@xcite as a function of the channel width .",
    "the quantization is well described by the theory of adiabatic propagation of free electrons.@xcite for non - interacting particles , conductance quantization should occur in longer channels too , as long as there is no backscattering off inhomogeneities within the channel .",
    "a lot is known about the role of electron - electron interaction of 1d channels .",
    "electron - electron repulsion in a wire enhances dramatically the reflection coefficient , making it energy - dependent.@xcite however , interaction between electrons does not alter the quantization ( in units of @xmath1 ) of an ideal channel conductance in the limit of zero temperature.@xcite what is still an open question is whether there are other manifestations of interactions due to inelastic processes , which influence the transport properties .    in the absence of interactions , left- and right - moving particles in a wire are at equilibrium with the reservoirs they originate from .",
    "if a bias is applied between the reservoirs , then these equilibria differ from each other , giving rise to a particular form of the non - equilibrium distribution inside the channel . on the other hand ,",
    "in a long ideal channel and in the presence of interactions one may expect equilibration to occur between the left- and right - movers into a single distribution characterized by an equilibrium with respect to a reference frame moving with some drift velocity .",
    "interestingly , in a model with momentum - independent electron velocity for left- and right - movers ( as it is the case in tomonaga - luttinger model ) there is no difference between the two distributions .",
    "effects originating from the particle - hole asymmetry , however , may discriminate between the two .",
    "thermopower and coulomb drag  @xcite are examples of such effects .    .",
    "this fabrication method has the advantage of producing reflectionless contacts to the leads,@xcite so that the boundary conditions of the distribution function is given by the fermi function of the reservoirs .",

    "the electron - electron interaction provides the most effective relaxation mechanism at low temperatures and therefore we include this relaxation mechanism as the first approach .",
    "however , in 1d pair collisions can not change the distribution function for quadratic dispersion , since the momentum and energy conservation@xcite laws result in either zero momentum exchange or an interchange of the two momenta .",
    "@xcite in either case the distribution function remains the same .",
    "thus , the leading equilibration mechanism is due to three - particle collisions , which we study in this paper.@xcite    we investigate here the effects of three - particle collisions in reasonably short wires ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qpc - picture ] ) , where electron - electron scattering can be considered perturbatively . as measurable quantities ,",
    "we evaluate the temperature dependence of the thermopower and conductance .",
    "note that for more than one mode pair collisions become important for certain fillings.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : first we review the non - interacting limit of thermopower and give a qualitative explanation of the effects due to three - particle collisions .",

    "next we calculate the main ingredient for our perturbation theory , namely the three - particle matrix element and scattering rate using a @xmath5-matrix expansion .",
    "we note several interesting properties of this scattering rate . finally , we derive the conductance and thermopower corrections and discuss the deviation from the so - called mott formula .",
    "furthermore , some technical details are put in two appendices , and in appendix [ appendix - a - meso - princip ] we show that the number of left and right movers have to change in a scattering event for the current to change .      for a wire without interactions the distribution function @xmath6 is determined solely by the electron reservoirs @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dispersion relation for momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 ( suppressed in the notation ) , and @xmath11^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the chemical potential and temperature of the left / right contact , respectively ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : scattering - picture],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one of the main results of this paper is that the three - particle collisions give a _ positive _ contribution to the thermopower , i.e.  the current due to a temperature difference is _ increased _ by the three - particle scattering .",
    "this can be explained in simple terms .",
    "firstly , to change the current the number of left and right moving electrons need to change , since it is the number of electrons going through a mesoscopic structure that determines the current and not their velocity ( see the appendix [ appendix - a - meso - princip ] ) .",
    "secondly , we find the dominant scattering process at low temperature to only involve a single electron changing direction .",

    "the left moving electrons have a higher temperature then the right moving ones , which favors scattering into the warmer distribution as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering - picture](b ) .",
    "this thus creates more left moving electrons and thereby increases the particle current towards the colder reservoir , i.e.  increasing the thermopower .",
    "another important point is that the thermopower and conductance corrections are exponential in temperature , i.e.  proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the dominant three - particle scattering process requiring an empty state near the bottom of the band .",
    "we find the form of the thermopower correction at low temperatures due to the three particle scattering to be given by @xmath23 where @xmath3 is the electron - electron interaction strength and @xmath24 the fermi temperature .",
    "this is found perturbatively in the short wire limit .",
    "the long - wire limit remains an open question , and we expect that the length dependence of thermopower saturates once @xmath0 exceeds some relaxation length ( which increases for decreasing temperature ) .",
    "in contrast , the conductance correction is negative . to understand this , note that the chemical potential of the initial distribution is higher for the right moving electrons then the left moving ones .",
    "this favors scattering into the left moving branch ( still with the process shown in fig .",
