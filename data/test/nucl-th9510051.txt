    "the qcd sum rule ( qcd - sr ) approach to qcd continues to be a highly active field .",
    "the influence of the field is reflected in over 1500 references to the seminal paper of shifman , vainshtein and zakharov ( svz ) @xcite , with over 380 of these references following the beginning of 1992 @xcite .",
    "while the approach has been applied to a variety of hadronic observables in both vacuum and finite density nuclear matter , a comprehensive review of the systematic errors associated with the approach has not been considered .",
    "one of the key assumptions of the approach is the use of the so called `` continuum model '' to remove excited state contaminations from the hadron correlator under investigation .",
    "recently , the continuum model for the nucleon was tested by using correlation functions calculated via lattice regularized qcd @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the continuum model adequately removes the excited state contaminations and allows the isolation of the ground state .",
    "the success of the continuum model warrants a more careful investigation of other aspects of the qcd - sr approach so that uncertainties in the predictions may be reliably and quantitatively determined .",
    "the focus of this paper is to establish a rigorous procedure for extracting quantities of phenomenological interest from qcd sum rules .",
    "the main conclusion of this investigation is that qcd sum rules work and they are predictive when the analysis is done rigorously .",
    "the ground state masses of the @xmath0-meson and the nucleon are used to introduce the concepts .",
    "however , the procedures introduced here are more generally applicable to quantities of current experimental interest .",
    "the goal is to shed light on the stability of qcd sum rule analyses and thus the accuracy to which observables may be reliably determined .",
    "implementation of the procedure introduced here does not lead to slight adjustments in the extracted parameters , but rather leads to qualitatively different conclusions .",
    "it will become apparent that most existing qcd - sr investigations of nucleon properties are in fact unreliable .",
    "previous calculations are based on sum rules in which neither the operator product expansion ( ope ) nor the phenomenological description are under acceptable control .",
    "the qcd - sr method is presently the best fundamentally based approach for investigating the properties of hadrons in nuclear matter , as the lattice approach is challenged by a number of formidable obstacles @xcite .",
    "issues surrounding the finite width of the rho - meson make reliable lattice calculations of @xmath2 mixing very difficult .",
    "these are two of the many topics of current interest to nuclear physicists where the best fundamentally based approach is that of qcd - srs .",
    "moreover , the approach has minimal model dependence .",
    "hence it is imperative to probe the predictive ability of the approach and the ideas presented here are currently being applied to these topics mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the most significant source of uncertainty in the qcd sum rule approach is an imprecise knowledge of the vacuum condensates appearing in the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "this is particularly problematic for the higher dimension operators , where one usually invokes the vacuum saturation hypothesis ( factorization ) to replace higher - dimension - operator vacuum - expectation values by products of lower - dimension operators .",
    "a list of key sources of uncertainty in the qcd - sr approach should include :    * the unfactorized condensate values , * factorization of higher dimensional operators , * small but neglected @xmath3 corrections , * the truncation of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , * the selection of the regime for matching the qcd and phenomenological sides of the sum rules , * uncertainties associated with the summation of perturbation theory in large orders , and * the possibility of significant direct instanton contributions .    with the exception of direct instanton contributions ,",
    "the effects of these uncertainties will be estimated via a monte - carlo error analysis .",
    "gaussian distributions for the condensate values are generated via monte carlo .",
    "these distributions are selected to reflect the spread of values assumed in previously published qcd - sr analyses , and the uncertainties such as operator factorization listed above .",
    "these distributions provide a distribution for the ope and thus uncertainty estimates for the ope which will be used in a @xmath4 fit .",
    "in turn , the ope distribution provides distributions for the phenomenological fit parameters , thus establishing the predictive ability of the qcd - sr approach .      in the field of qcd inspired models",
    ", the focus is often on whether or not the model is able to encompass the known experimental data , as opposed to assessing the predictive potential of the method .",
    "a review of the qcd - sr literature leaves no doubt as to whether or not the qcd - sr method is able to encompass the established data . the poorly determined condensate values and arbitrary aspect of the matching borel regime provides tremendous freedom in devising ways to achieve the desired result",
    "in fact , it is difficult to find qcd - sr - based predictions of hadronic observables which fail to agree with experiment .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since the physics responsible for some observables may be poorly represented in a truncated ope commonly limited to distances of less than 0.3 fm .",
    "most qcd - sr calculations of nucleon properties in the literature fall short in the analysis stage where the phenomenological parameters are determined by matching the qcd and phenomenological sides of the sum rules .",
    "typical analysis short - comings include :    * selecting a single value for the borel parameter which gives `` nice '' results .",
    "a borel _ regime _ should be selected in order to evaluate the stability and reliability of the results . *",
    "a selection of the borel regime without careful regard to ope convergence nor maintaining ground state dominance of the phenomenological side of the sum rules . * the fixing of search parameters ( such as the continuum threshold ) to preferred values .",
    "it will become apparent that this introduces a strong bias to the remaining fit parameters which may not reflect the properties of qcd .",
    "* claiming an accuracy for qcd - sr predictions without supporting calculations .",
    "occasionally a `` stability analysis '' @xcite is considered , in which fit parameters are monitored as a single condensate value is varied .",
    "however , such analyses explore a relatively small corner of the condensate parameter space .    in general , former procedures adopted for matching the two sides of the sum rules lack the level of rigor which will be presented here .",
    "this general lack of rigor can be traced back to the original paper of svz @xcite . in their conclusions , they comment `` we prefer not to deepen into the debris of computer calculations , sophisticated fit programs , arranging error bars here and there@xmath5 '' while this may be appropriate for a seminal paper on the qcd - sr approach , continuation of this philosophy has lead to strong negative criticism of the qcd - sr field .",
    "it is not uncommon to hear remarks such as `` qcd sum rules are useful only if you know the answer . '' or `` you can get anything you want from qcd sum rules . '' and `` 10% here , 10% there  pretty soon you re talking about real numbers ! ''",
    "these remarks are unfortunate , as a rigorous and proficuous analysis is possible .      in this paper ,",
    "a method for the quantitative determination of phenomenological quantities with uncertainties will be presented . since this paper",
    "is directed to both qcd - sum - rule practitioners and skeptics alike , we begin by briefly outlining the qcd - sr approach in section [ qcdsr ] .",
    "a more pedagogical review of the approach may be found in the recent review article of ref .",
    "this section also introduces the `` ioffe formula '' @xcite , argued by many to qualitatively encapsulate a description of the nucleon mass in terms of the chiral symmetry breaking order parameter @xmath1 .",
    "uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the ope will be addressed via a new monte - carlo based procedure .",
    "estimates for these uncertainties are presented in section [ uncert ] .",
    "section [ analysis ] details the monte - carlo uncertainty analysis and discusses the optimization algorithm and cautious convergence criteria used in the following .",
    "section [ rho ] presents an analysis of @xmath0-meson sum rules . here",
    "the criteria for the selection of the regime for matching the qcd and phenomenological sides of the sum rules is reviewed .",

    "these considerations lead to the selection of the optimal interpolating field for nucleon sum rules .",
    "new insights into unconventional nucleon interpolators obtained from the lattice qcd investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite play a significant role here .",
    "section [ nucleon11 ] reviews the selection of the optimal nucleon interpolating field for correlators obtained from spin-1/2 interpolating fields .",
    "the effects of choosing non - optimal interpolators is demonstrated .",
    "section [ nucleon13 ] explores additional sum rules obtained from the overlap of the generalized spin-1/2 and a spin-3/2 interpolator .    in section [ correl ] we explore the correlations between condensate values , fit parameters and sum rule consistency .",
    "these correlations serve to identify the roles of the leading terms of the ope in hadronic physics .",
    "the validity of the `` ioffe formula '' is evaluated here , and these results may be of interest to those modeling the qcd vacuum .",
    "the contingency table analysis reveals that the intimate relationship between the quark condensate and the nucleon mass suggested in the `` ioffe formula '' is invalid .",
    "the necessity of direct instanton contributions to the qcd sum rules is determined in section [ instantons ] .",
    "we demonstrate that there is no evidence indicating that direct instanton contributions are required to maintain sum rule consistency .",
    "the implications of the results of this analysis on coordinate space correlators are discussed in section [ coordimpl ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] summarizes the findings of this in - depth investigation .",
    "the underlying principle of field theoretic approaches to hadron phenomenology is the ansatz of duality .",
    "that is , it is possible to simultaneously describe a hadron as quarks propagating in the qcd vacuum , and as a phenomenological field with the appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "hadron masses are extracted from an analysis of the two - point function @xmath6 the interpolating field @xmath7 is typically constructed from quark field operators combined to give the quantum numbers of the hadron under investigation .",
    "the @xmath0-meson interpolator related to the decay constant is @xmath8 to maintain maximal overlap with the ground state relative to excited states , only interpolators without derivatives are considered . for the nucleon we begin by considering the most general spin-1/2 nucleon interpolator @xmath9 where    @xmath10    and @xmath11",
    "@xmath12 is the interpolator typically used in lattice qcd analyses .",
    "@xmath13 vanishes in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "however in a theory with light relativistic current quarks , there is no reason to exclude such an interpolating field _ a priori _ @xcite . with the use of the fierz relations",
    ", the combination of the above two interpolating fields for @xmath14 may be written    @xmath15    [ chisr ]    giving the proton interpolating field advocated by ioffe @xcite and often found in qcd - sr calculations .      at the phenomenological level one",
    "proceeds by inserting a complete set of eigenstates with the quantum numbers of the interpolator .",
    "the ability of the interpolator to annihilate a positive parity baryon to the qcd vacuum is described by the parameter @xmath16 in @xmath17 for state @xmath18 of momentum @xmath19 and spin @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is a dirac spinor .",
    "negative parity states require a @xmath22 on the right - hand side of ( [ lambdadef ] ) .",
    "for the nucleon , the two point function has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 corresponds to positive / negative parity baryons . while there is some suppression of excited state contributions to the two - point function ,",
    "there is little hope of isolating ground state properties from such a function .",
    "hence one uses the celebrated borel transform @xmath25 = \\lim_{{\\scriptstyle -p^2 \\to \\infty \\atop                          \\scriptstyle     n \\to \\infty } \\atop                          \\scriptstyle -p^2/n = m^2 } { 1\\over n ! } ( -p^2)^{n+1 } \\left ( { d \\over d p^2 } \\right ) ^n f ( p^2 ) \\ , , \\ ] ] at each dirac-@xmath26 structure to obtain exponential suppression of excited states . the parameter @xmath27 is commonly referred to as the borel mass .",
    "the borel transform is easily applied to a dispersion relation for @xmath28 at each dirac-@xmath26 structure @xmath29 and the polynomial subtraction terms are eliminated by the borel transform . at the structure @xmath30 one has    @xmath31    where we have introduced the spectral density @xmath32 , @xmath33[gp ]    at the structure @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36    here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 account for excited state contributions , and @xmath24 in ( [ rho1 ] ) corresponds to positive / negative parity states .",
    "for the vector meson one has    @xmath39    @xmath40    [ rhov ]    at the structure @xmath41 .      at the quark level ,",
    "one exploits the operator product expansion ( ope ) to describe the short distance behavior of the two - point function    @xmath42    [ ope ]    where @xmath43 is the normalization point at which the coefficient functions and the operators are defined .",
    "here we have explicitly included all operators up to dimension eight , to leading order in the quark mass @xmath44 , having the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "the first digit of the subscript of the wilson coefficients @xmath45 gives the energy dimension of the operator .",
    "@xmath46 may take any of the 16 independent dirac-@xmath26 matrices .    upon fourier transforming to momentum space , ( [ ope ] )",
    "becomes an expansion in @xmath47 , valid for large momentum transfers .",
    "thus one may use perturbation theory to calculate the wilson coefficients .",
    "the contribution of the gluon operator term 4.1 in the expansion for the proton is suppressed due a factor of @xmath48 which appears in the denominator of the wilson coefficient arising from integration over the quark - loop momentum which introduces the factor @xmath49 .",
    "terms involving more than two gluon field strength tensors @xmath50 and products of @xmath44 and @xmath51 are estimated to be small and are typically neglected .",
    "the standard treatment of the ope proceeds via inserting the explicit forms of the interpolating fields into the two - point function of ( [ twopt ] ) and contracting out pairs of time - ordered quark - field operators which are the fully interacting quark propagators of qcd .",

    "for the @xmath0 meson this term corresponds to an operator of dimension eight , and for the nucleon the dimensions are twelve and thirteen for the two nucleon sum rules obtained from spin-1/2 interpolating fields .",
    "since the ope for the @xmath0-meson is traditionally truncated at dimension eight @xcite , the correlator should be more reliable than for the nucleon sum rules which are truncated at dimension nine .",
    "it is well known that the standard treatment of the ope encounters difficulties at large orders in the perturbative expansion of the wilson coefficients .",
    "perturbative expansions are divergent at large orders and are asymptotic at best @xcite . in the standard treatment , these divergences limit the accuracy to which the perturbative coefficients may be determined .",
    "renormalons @xcite , a particular set of perturbative graphs , provide a simple illustration of the factorial growth in the contributions of perturbative graphs at large orders @xcite .",
    "the factorial growth in large - order contributions associated with soft infrared ( ir ) virtual momenta is problematic , as the series is not borel summable . as such , the wilson coefficients , by themselves ,",
    "are ill defined in the standard treatment . the uncertainty resulting from the restriction to finite orders of the asymptotic expansion",
    "is commonly referred to as the ir renormalon ambiguity . of course the use of perturbative propagators to describe soft virtual momenta is incorrect .",
    "instead , one must utilize fully dressed nonperturbative propagators . hence",
    ", it is not surprising one encounters difficulties in the ir regime , as one is simply encountering the landau pole of the perturbative coupling constant .",
    "a solution to the ir renormalon ambiguity problem was provided by the itep group @xcite through the introduction of the normalization / separation scale @xmath43 of ( [ opemu ] ) .",
    "the ope becomes a separation of scales , with virtual momenta lying above @xmath43 represented in the wilson coefficients , and momenta below @xmath43 in the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of higher - dimension operators beginning at dimension four .",
    "the introduction of the scale @xmath43 eliminates the ir renormalon ambiguity of the perturbative expansion .",
    "however , in principle , both the wilson coefficients and the vevs of operators contain perturbative as well as nonperturbative physics .    in principle , the ope defined in ( [ opemu ] ) is free of ir renormalon ambiguities .",
    "however , in practice it is difficult to implement the formal procedure of truncating virtual momenta below @xmath43 when calculating higher order @xmath3 corrections to the wilson coefficients . while these contributions are small for leading order corrections , their inclusion is a source of error which can be accommodated in the monte - carlo uncertainty analysis .    in the ultraviolet ( uv ) virtual momenta regime , the renormalon series is sign alternating and borel summable .",
    "summation of the uv series can give rise to a power correction proportional to @xmath63 which closely resembles the squared quark mass contribution to the ope @xcite .",
    "for the vector correlator , the uv renormalon gives rise to an effective mass of roughly @xmath64 , which is much larger than the usual current quark mass the order of 5 mev @xcite .",
    "hence there is some concern that important power corrections associated with uv renormalons has been overlooked in the standard qcd - sr treatment .",
    "moreover , it is the power corrections that provide the link to nonperturbative phenomena . to the extent that the power correction is scheme dependent and",
    "not reliably known , we will refer to these quark - mass like power corrections as uv renormalon uncertainties .",
    "additional evidence for @xmath65-type power corrections independent of renormalons has been obtained through a consideration of constraints imposed by asymptotic freedom and analyticity on the large - order behavior of perturbation theory @xcite . in this case",
    "the perturbative series is not borel summable .",
    "given the absence of a local gauge - invariant field - operator product of dimension two , some might argue that the coefficient of the singularity in the borel plane governing the large - order behavior of perturbative series must have a zero .",
    "however , perturbative estimates of the coefficient do not provide evidence of such a zero @xcite and the issue is unsettled .",
    "hence the issue of possible dimension - two power corrections is of current interest .",

    "the qualitative features of chiral symmetry breaking coupled with the quantitative success of these relations has lead to enormous faith being placed into the validity of the ioffe formula .",
    "most practitioners expect this relation to be valid , at least in a qualitative manner of proportionality .",
    "the operator product expansion provides knowledge of the two - point function ( [ twopt ] ) in the near perturbative regime .",
    "as such the correlator represents contributions from both the ground state hadron and excited states . to maintain some predictive ability in the qcd - sr approach , a `` continuum model '' for excited state contributions to the correlator is introduced",

    "they are typically 10 to 50% @xcite .",
    "the validity of this somewhat crude model is relied upon to cleanly remove the excited state contaminations .    in the lattice qcd investigation of the continuum model formulated in euclidean space @xcite , the short time regime of point - to - point lattice correlation functions",
    "is described well by the qcd - sum - rule - inspired continuum model . there , the laplace transform of the spectral density appears to be sufficient to render any structure in the spectral density insignificant in the short euclidean time regime of point - to - point correlators .",
    "similar conclusions are expected to hold for the borel transformed sum rules under investigation here .    it should be noted that the spectral density of the physical world is different than that encountered on the lattice .",
    "for example , in the nucleon channel one expects strength in the correlator above the ground state to start at the @xmath86 threshold @xcite , whereas in the lattice calculations such contributions are altered by the heavier quark mass and the quenched approximation .",
    "while the lattice results are encouraging , one may find that in some cases the continuum model is not sufficiently detailed when the continuum model contributions are large .",
    "an example of this will be presented in the discussion surrounding the @xmath0-meson sum rules , where discrepancies may be due to an over simplified continuum model .",
    "the origin of the uncertainty estimate for the ope lies in the uncertainties assigned to the qcd parameters appearing in the truncated ope . in this section",
    "we assess the uncertainties on these qcd parameters .    in assigning these uncertainties one would like to select values conservatively enough such that the qcd - sr approach can test the validity of our present understanding of qcd .",
    "qcd - sr predictions that fail to agree with experiment at the @xmath87 level should indicate a possibly interesting discrepancy . at the same time",
    "one would also like to select uncertainties in accord with the generally accepted values in the literature .",
    "in addition , the error assessments need to reflect uncertainties associated with the factorization of higher dimensional operators and small but never - the - less neglected @xmath3 corrections .",
    "these considerations have been balanced in the following . while some may argue that some values are known better than that indicated here",
    ", others will no doubt argue that the errors are underestimated .    in any event",

    "however , we are somewhat skeptical of the refinements of this result as the analysis is based on an approach which is criticized in the following . the most reliable sum rules of sec . [ nucleon13 ] also prefer a larger gluon condensate in order to maintain consistency between the sum rules . there",
    "it is found that the nucleon mass may be reproduced with a value of @xmath103 gev@xmath98 which agrees with experimental estimate .",

    "this approach fails to apply an appropriate weight to sum rule discrepancies , unlike the @xmath4 measure of ( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "2 .   the algorithm used to fit the sum rules did not employ the cautious convergence criteria discussed in section [ algorithm ] .",

    "3 .   only the standard condensate parameter set was considered in determining the nucleon mass . here",
    "1000 sets are considered .",
    "the optimal parameter set found in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to a local minimum which is sensitive to the measure of sum rule agreement , the initial parameter estimates and the condensate parameter set .",
    "other authors have managed to keep the nucleon mass closer to the experimental result by extracting the result from a regime in borel space that provides the correct answer or fixing the continuum threshold to values suggested by the particle data tables . as we shall see in section [ correl ] , fixing the continuum threshold to phenomenologically motivated values largely determines the mass .",
    "hence you _ can _ get anything you want provided you are clever enough to fix the threshold to the _ right _ value . and since the excited states are modeled there is tremendous freedom in the threshold parameter space .",
    "of course , such input may not be in agreement with the content of the ope . in any event , such results must not be regarded as predictions of qcd sum rules .",
    "having established the nucleon sum rule of ( [ nucl11at1 ] ) at the structure 1 to be the potentially more reliable sum rule , it is important to determine the optimal mixing of spin-1/2 interpolators for this sum rule .",
    "it has long been established that there are two independent interpolating fields with no derivatives having the quantum numbers of spin 1/2 and isospin 1/2 .",

    "a change in sign from the leading terms of the ope will also assist in distinguishing ground state strength from excited state strength as the change in the curvature of the correlator will be more prominent .",

    "= 11.7truecm =    the corresponding dependence of @xmath148 on @xmath214 is plagued by huge uncertainties .",
    "small changes in the nucleon mass which appears squared in the exponential of the phenomenological side of the sum rules leads to large fluctuations in @xmath148 .",
    "hence it is difficult to gain any information on the possible size of direct instanton contributions .",
    "however , they are certainly unnecessary as all ratios encompass 1 .    in order to proceed",
    ", we consider fixing the nucleon mass to the value determined at @xmath228 in an attempt to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath148 .",
    "figure [ lambdaevolmfixed ] displays these ratios .",
    "the corresponding plot for the continuum threshold is given in figure [ contevol ] .",
    "= 11.7truecm =    = 11.7truecm =    for @xmath282 the continuum threshold tends to rise and the distribution of the residue remains largely independent of @xmath214 without direct instanton contributions . for @xmath283",
    "the continuum threshold drops to account for strength that would otherwise be absorbed by the rising nucleon mass as illustrated in figure [ massevol ] . with the threshold near the pole position , strength which might otherwise rest in the pole has been suppressed as discussed in section [ phenomcorr ] .",
    "hence the drop in the residue is an artifact of our fixing the nucleon mass in an attempt to reduce the error bar .    in summary ,",
    "the independence of the mass and residue from @xmath227 is satisfied within uncertainties in the absence of direct instanton contributions .",
    "as the sum rules are improved in the future and qcd input parameters are better determined , it will be important to repeat this analysis to again evaluate the necessity of direct instanton contributions or other refinements of the qcd - sr approach .    at present ,",
    "direct instanton contributions are not required .",
    "this is good news indeed as the amount of modeling required for instanton estimates is relatively unpalatable when compared to that for the standard qcd - srs themselves .",
    "in fact a preferable approach would be to simply raise the ope separation scale further into the perturbative regime to ensure that direct instanton effects are more fully accounted .",
    "however , this does not yet appear to be necessary .",
    "ground state properties have been found to be independent of the interpolating field mixing parameter @xmath214 . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading terms of the ope for ( [ nucl11 ] ) are very dependent on @xmath214 .",
    "this situation has interesting ramifications for previous analyses of coordinate space point - to - point correlation functions @xcite where there has been some confusion surrounding the physics represented in point - to - point correlation functions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite some conclusions are drawn from an incorrect interpretation of the physics represented in two - point correlators .",
    "these authors suggest that the behavior of a ratio of the interacting to free correlator can reveal information on clustering in the scalar diquark channel .    it should be emphasized that the phenomenological description of the two - point function involves the baryon mass , the continuum threshold describing the effective onset of excited states and the residue of the pole which indicates the ability of the particular interpolator to excite the baryon from the qcd vacuum .",
    "information on quark configurations in the nucleon wave function is absent in point - to - point correlation functions",
    ".    the coordinate - space correlator may be obtained from ( [ rhop ] ) or ( [ rho1 ] ) via @xmath284 the important point here is that for large @xmath285 , @xmath286 is dominated by the contribution from the ground state pole . as such @xmath286 is independent of @xmath227 at the 1% level , or",
    "alternatively @xmath286 is independent of @xmath287 at the 10% level @xcite .    the coordinate space analyses focused on a ratio of @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the free coordinate - space correlator . for the correlator at the structure",
    "@xmath290 studied in @xcite at @xmath14 , the generalized free correlator is given by @xmath291 since the denominator is @xmath214 dependent and the numerator is independent of @xmath214 for large @xmath285 , the ratio is dependent on @xmath214 .",
    "the rate at which the curve turns up as the ground state dominates and the free correlator continues to drop off for increasing @xmath285 is dependent on the interpolator mixing parameter @xmath214 .",
    "the rate at which the ratio increases above 1 describes the relative weightings of ground versus excited states generated by the interpolating field .",
    "it has nothing to do with the possibility of scalar diquark degrees of freedom being predominant in the nucleon wave function .",
    "moreover , a comparison with a @xmath292 correlation function for example has no meaning .",
    "a rigorous procedure for extracting quantities of phenomenological interest from qcd sum rules has been established .",
    "we have performed a comprehensive analysis of ground state @xmath0-meson and nucleon qcd sum rules .",
    "the inclusion of uncertainty estimates for the phenomenological parameters has allowed us to evaluate the predictive ability and self consistency of the qcd - srs . when the analysis is done rigorously ,",
    "qcd sum rules are predictive .",
    "some have argued that fitting sum rules appears to be more of an art than a science .",
    "indeed , many of the findings here contradict the conventional wisdom of both practitioners and skeptics alike @xcite and suggests that past arguments have been based more on rhetoric than sound scientific arguments .      *",
    "the nucleon sum rule of ( [ nucl11atp ] ) , traditionally taken to be the most reliable sum rule , fails to have a borel regime where both the truncated ope is reasonably convergent and the ground state dominates the phenomenology . * the nucleon sum rule of ( [ nucl11at1 ] ) , also obtained from spin-1/2 interpolating fields , resolves the nucleon mass to @xmath293 mev .",
    "this uncertainty is more than double the value commonly assumed by most practitioners . *",
    "the nucleon sum rules of ( [ nucl13atgg ] ) and ( [ nucl13atgqq ] ) obtained from the consideration of a spin-3/2 isospin-1/2 interpolator projected by the generalized spin-1/2 isospin-1/2 interpolator are much more reliable than the traditional sum rules .",
    "they have greater overlap with the ground state pole relative to the continuum model , have broader valid borel regimes and provide phenomenological estimates of nucleon spectral properties which are more stable than those obtained from the conventional sum rules . *",
    "the nucleon mass obtained from a simultaneous analysis of ( [ nucl13atgg ] ) and ( [ nucl13atgqq ] ) at the optimal @xmath228 is resolved to @xmath294 mev using qcd parameter estimates from the literature . *",
    "the dependence of the spectral parameters on the interpolating field mixing parameter is in accord with expectations without resort to direct instanton contributions .",
    "this is compelling evidence that instanton physics is adequately accounted for in the nonperturbative vacuum expectation values .",
    "the latter point is truly exciting for the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "the amount of modeling required for instanton estimates is relatively unpalatable when compared to that for the standard qcd - srs themselves .      *",
    "the leading order @xmath3 corrections are the order of 50% . as such , perturbative corrections to this sum rule are very likely out of control .",
    "* summation of the perturbative series may give rise to an important dimension - two contribution @xcite .",
    "the size of such a correction is presently unknown . *",
    "contributions from the four - quark condensate are not well known and appear to be large . unlike the @xmath0-meson sum rule , the four - quark condensate is not suppressed by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "* a regime in which the ope is reasonably convergent while the phenomenological description is dominated by the ground state pole is non - existent .",
    "if one proceeds with this sum rule , the results are very sensitive to the model for the continuum , or inaccuracies in the ope lead to incorrect results as seen here .",
    "the `` ioffe formula '' directly relating the nucleon mass to the local chiral condensate has been found to be misleading at best . while there is a strong connection between chiral symmetry breaking and hadron properties , such detailed or direct relationships are impossible to make and it is inappropriate to be more specific on the origin of the nucleon mass .",
    "the fundamental and derivative sum rules for the @xmath0 meson have also been examined . once again , the popular sum rule analysis has been found to be undesirable .",
    "the use of derivative sum rules for the determination of @xmath0-meson spectral properties is unfavorable . increased continuum model contributions , poorer ope convergence , and loss of vital information in the derivative sum rule results in discrepancies between the fundamental and derivative sum rules .",
    "the associations among the phenomenological fit parameters are particularly interesting as they reveal how the sum rules resolve the spectral properties .",
    "we have found that the separation of the ground state from the excited state continuum model is completely determined by the high dimension operators of the ope which are not used in formulating the continuum model .",
    "the practice of fixing the continuum threshold to a preferred value has been exposed as strongly determining the outcome of the sum rule analysis .",
    "qcd sum rule determinations of phenomenological spectral properties are necessarily dependent on the treatment of high dimension operators where a factorization assumption is usually invoked .",
    "moreover , careful attention to ope convergence is crucial to extracting meaningful results .",
    "these issues are somewhat unsettling , as we are working with expansions which are asymptotic .",
    "the emphasis here has been on exploring the qcd parameter space via monte carlo .",
    "further refinements of the parameter space might be made by adjusting the valid borel regime for each qcd parameter set such that the 10%50% criteria are satisfied .",
    "this was not done here in order to explore other criteria and reduce the sensitivity to a reasonable yet somewhat arbitrary criteria .",
    "in addition , the hlder inequalities might be applied as a further check of the validity and consistency of the sum rules @xcite .",
    "we are now in an excellent position to attack phenomena which is of current interest to the nuclear physics community .",
    "the techniques are currently being applied to an in - medium study of vector meson properties @xcite . there",
    "the debates over the behavior of the vector - meson masses and the sum rules to be used in extracting vector meson properties in nuclear matter are resolved . using standard in - medium condensate estimates",
    ", the analysis leaves no doubt that vector - meson masses decrease with increasing density .",
    "these techniques are also being applied to in - medium properties of the nucleon @xcite , by generalizing the vacuum sum rules analyzed here to finite nuclear matter density .",
    "the monte - carlo techniques are resolving the predictive ability of the in - medium sum rules .",
    "another investigation utilizing these monte - carlo techniques studies the qcd - sr determination of the @xmath295 meson mixing parameter @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "there , correlations between the ratio of @xmath296 and @xmath297 quark masses are particularly interesting .",
    "the relatively large uncertainty in the residue of the pole does not bode well for qcd sum rule analysis beyond two - point functions .",
    "for example , the residue of the pole appears as a pre - factor to any nucleon matrix element such as @xmath92 or magnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "it will not be surprising to find uncertainties in these observables as large as the 35% relative error in the squared residue itself . as the uncertainties in the additional vacuum matrix elements relevant to the three - point functions are folded in the uncertainties are likely to exceed 50% and may in fact approach 100% .",
    "analyses of these issues are currently underway @xcite .    when compared to uncertainty estimates previously published in the literature , our uncertainty estimates are somewhat larger .",
    "this is not due to any shortcoming of the approach presented here . instead ,",
    "previous authors have failed to provide a reliable method for determining realistic uncertainties .",
    "often , uncertainty estimates have been conjectured without any supporting quantitative analysis .",
    "this in - depth examination of qcd sum rule self consistency paints a favorable picture for further quantitative refinements of the approach .",
    "of course such progress will be very difficult , as there are many aspects of the approach which must be refined for any particular improvement to be relevant .",
    "the techniques introduced here , such as maintaining independence of ground state properties from the interpolating field mixing parameter , might be used to further narrow the uncertainties of the approach .",
    "it is extremely important to refine the qcd - sr approach such that uncertainties in the qcd input parameters may be reduced while maintaining @xmath298 .",
    "research in this direction is required before meaningful qcd - sr - based predictions for nucleon matrix elements and moments of structure functions are possible .",
