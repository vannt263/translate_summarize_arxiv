    "currently , such circuits find striking repercussions in quantum state generation  @xcite , sensing  @xcite , chemistry  @xcite , teleportation - based communication  @xcite , as well as in quantum computation and simulation  @xcite , otherwise unreachable using bulk approaches .",
    "generating and manipulating photon - number states with linear optics stands as a prerequisite for photonic based quantum computing schemes  @xcite . yet",
    ", the realization of complex optical circuits requires waveguide technologies and deterministic single photon generators for achieving scalability , stability , and miniaturization of such devices  @xcite .",
    "deterministic sources are currently addressed using atom - like systems such as nv - centres in diamond and quantum dots  @xcite . however , current technological constraints limit their multiplexing for more advanced setups .",
    "nonlinear photon - pair generation can be used to obtain entangled states but is inherently unscalable due to the probabilistic nature of the process  @xcite .",
    "an alternative configuration , based on combining heralded single photon sources  @xcite , holds great promise since no other method , currently available , can produce photons in as close to a deterministic fashion . in this context",
    ", the generation of heralded entangled states has never been demonstrated so far on a chip . more specifically , incorporating a large number of complementary optical functions results in challenging fabrication procedures ,",
    "notably when monolithic approaches are employed  @xcite , preventing the simultaneous achievement of efficient , configurable , and heralded devices .",
    "hybrid photonic devices have emerged as a solution to the challenges of monolithic integration by combining components which are optimised for their individual function .",
    "lithium niobate ( ln ) waveguides have been coupled to passive optical circuits  @xcite , quantum - dot emitters have been coupled to reconfigurable circuits  @xcite , and single photon detectors have been incorporated onto a range of substrates  @xcite . to achieve higher quantum state generation capabilities , notably for quantum sensing and computing applications , our hybrid device merges two photon - pair sources and a dynamically configurable optical circuit capable of heralding the emission of engineered two - photon states at a telecom wavelength . the combination of two different fabrication techniques , _",
    "i.e. _ , non - linear waveguides on ln  @xcite and femtosecond - laser - direct - written waveguides  ( fldw ) on glass  @xcite , enables high photon - pair generation efficiencies and the potential of 3d reconfigurable circuits for photon routing .",
    "our realisation is depicted in fig  [ exp ] .",
    "a pump laser , emitting picosecond pulses at 712 nm , at a repetition rate @xmath1=76mhz , is sent , by means of a polarisation - maintaining - fibre pigtail , to the hybrid device .",
    "the latter can be decomposed into three building - blocks , all formed from single - mode waveguides at their respective operation wavelengths .",
    "block i splits the pump pulses into two spatial modes , using a laser - written 50/50 beam splitter made of evanescently coupled waveguides .",
    "those pulses enter block ii to simultaneously pump two independent nonlinear waveguides .",
    "these are periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides ( ppln / w ) , where photon pairs can be generated by type-0 spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "phase matching is engineered such that identical non - degenerate photon pairs are produced at the telecom wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1560 nm in each waveguide .",
    "block iii is dedicated to engineering and heralding any desired path - coded two - photon quantum state .",
    "photon pairs are split deterministically as a function of their wavelengths by two laser - written wavelength division multiplexers ( wdms ) .",
    "these route the 1310 nm photons in the outer modes ( h1 , h2 ) towards the heralding detectors that consist of laser - clock triggered avalanche photodiodes ( apd , idq 210 ) .",
    "the complementary photons at 1560 nm are routed in the inner modes ( a1 , a2 ) towards a 3d mach - zehnder interferometer  ( mzi ) for quantum state engineering .",
    "the 3d capabilities of the fldw technique permit application of a temperature gradient over the vertically separated arms of the interferometer  @xcite .",
    "phase tuning is performed with a thin film resistive heater ( nicr ) deposited on the surface of the chip .",
    "consequently , the phase - controlled mzi behaves as a tunable beam - splitter , allowing dynamic ( khz range ) engineering of path - coded quantum states .      for an applied phase shift @xmath2 , assuming symmetric beamsplitter operators , the output state of the two 1560 nm photons reads ( see methods for more details ) : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 describes a two - photon n00n state of the form @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a coherent superposition of 2 photons being delocalised over the two inner ( a1 , a2 ) output modes ( see also fig .  [ exp ] ) , while @xmath6 describes the path product state @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ , one photon in each output mode of the mzi .",
    "as summarized in fig  [ fig : coincidencesvsphase](*a1 * ) , the output quantum state can be dynamically configured from @xmath4 to @xmath6 by setting the phase @xmath8 of the mzi accordingly as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10    for the case of single photon inputs , after the mzi , the output state reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe a single photon being delocalised between the two output modes ( see fig  [ fig : coincidencesvsphase](*a2 * ) ) . by setting the phase in the mzi to @xmath14 or @xmath15",
    ", we can obtain the classical states @xmath16 for @xmath10          the quality of the produced n00n state is determined by the indistinguishability of the two 1560 nm photons .",
    "this can be inferred using a hong - ou - mandel type setup  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "two - photon interference is observed via 4-fold coincidence measurements for various phase settings .",
    "the fully integrated optical configuration ensures perfect spatial mode overlap , identical polarisation mode , as well as simultaneous arrival times for the two photons at the beam splitter .",
    "temporal indistinguishability , _",
    "i.e. _ , enforcing a single temporal mode for both 1560 nm photons , is achieved with 200ghz bandwidth spectral filters on the heralding lines and with low - loss 100ghz dense - wdms placed on the heralded modes .",
    "engineering the quantum state from n00n to product and conversely , is monitored by registering 4-fold coincidences at the output of the chip .",
    "the heralded two - photon state is detected with triggered avalanche photodiodes ( apd , idq 201 ) following optical delay lines .",
    "the analysis of the 4-fold coincidence events is performed with a time - to - digital converter ( tdc , idq 800 ) .",
    "the quantum characterization of the chip exploits the repetition rate of the pump laser ( @xmath17 ) and the tdc capabilities .",
    "we monitor both the simultaneous and the delayed coincidence counts ( between non - overlapping heralded single photons coming from subsequent laser pulses ) to obtain a full record of single and two - photon interference patterns in a single measurement .",
    "as seen in fig  [ fig : coincidencesvsphase](*b * ) , the coincidence peak at @xmath18 reveals two - photon interference while those at @xmath19 provide single photon interference information . note that the latter can easily be related to the optical quality of the circuit or to the optical noise in the system .",
    "observe too that this is also a means to observe the increased phase sensitivity of the n00n states compared to single photon states .",
    "namely , in the case a n00n state is generated , we expect a doubled phase sensitivity compared to that of the product state .",
    "figure  [ 4fold ] presents the recorded 4-fold coincidence events for different phase settings .",
    "the acquired experimental data for both two - photon ( blue squares ) and single photon interference ( red squares ) are plotted .     and [ fit1 ] to the experimental data where the only free parameters are the visibility and the amplitude .",
    "[ 4fold ] ]    the fitting - curve parameters have been extracted from a classical characterization of the mzi ( period and phase , see also methods ) , allowing only the amplitude @xmath20 and the visibility @xmath21 of the interference fringes as free parameters .",
    "the fitting equations are @xmath22 for the two photon interference fringes , and @xmath23 for the single photon interference fringes . with the visibility defined by @xmath24",
    "we obtain a single photon fringe visibility of 99.0@xmath08.0% , confirming the excellent optical quality of the laser - written 3d mzi . on the other hand ,",
    "the visibility of the two - photon interference pattern is 90.0@xmath08.0% , further proving the excellent quality of the produced path - entangled , or two - photon n00n , state . in terms of fidelity to the ideal @xmath4 , those correspond to values of 99.5@xmath08.0% and 95.0@xmath08.0% , respectively .",
    "we stress that these values are obtained for the raw data without subtracting accidental events due to dark counts .",
    "note that the obtained visibility for the two - photon interference pattern is less than 100% .",
    "the remaining 10% is due to a combination of a non perfectly defined single temporal mode ( filtering stages ) and polarisation rotation in the 3d laser written mzi . moreover ,",
    "the quite high overall losses over each channel ( 14db ) lead to an expected low 4-fold rate , inducing large error bars .",
    "this figure could be reduced to an overall value of 6db , allowing better statistics , by improving the ppln - fdlw coupling efficiency and optimizing the chip propagation losses ( see also methods ) .",
    "our results demonstrate the first quantum device capable of heralding engineered two - photon states .",
    "the potential of hybrid integration technology is revealed when compared to previous realisations .",
    "notably , the manipulation of heralded path - entangled states was reported using a silicon chip capable of producing various states on demand , provided that it is fed with four identical photons from two external sources  @xcite .",
    "monolithic circuits , including the sources , were then proposed on both silicon  @xcite and ln  @xcite platforms to produce tunable two - photon states . however , despite optimized functionalities , the heralding feature could not be demonstrated as the devices were not suited for manipulating two photon pairs at a time .",
    "an alternative and simpler route has been investigated on ln , where two coupled non - linear waveguides are exploited to generate such states by engineering the coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the aforementioned devices , the design of this circuit is not suitable for heralded operation .",
    "ultimately , we have shown that our hybrid approach enables quantum capabilities going beyond state - of - the - art monolithic demonstrations . knowing that stitched - technologies have recently been proposed for on - chip integration of detectors@xcite",
    ", hybrid strategies therefore pave the way towards next generation quantum photonics applications and systems .",
    "the femtosecond laser direct - write ( fldw ) technique exploits a high power laser focused inside a glass substrate to produce permanent molecular changes in the glass structure which results in a refractive index increase  @xcite .",
    "the glass is translated with respect to the laser focus point with high - precision air bearing stages in three dimensions ( aerotech ) .",
    "we employ a 5mhz , 40fs , @xmath252w average power laser , emitting pulses at 800 nm ( femtolasers xl500 ) .",
    "typical waveguide writing pulse energies are between 40 and 150nj .",
    "the translation stage speed is nominally 1000mm / min .",
    "the device fabrication time is below 20min for a 40@xmath2640mm@xmath27 chip completely filled with photonic circuits .",
    "thermal annealing is used to reduce waveguide bend losses , stress induced birefringence , and to improve mode overlap to that of a single mode fibre  @xcite .",
    "the final propagation losses for waveguides in schott af45 are as low as 0.1db / cm .",
    "the mode overlap losses are between 5 to 10% per facet and the total insertion loss for a 30mm - long - straight waveguide is 0.8db .",
    "the entangled photon - pair generators consist of soft proton exchange ( spe )  @xcite waveguides integrated on periodically - poled lithium niobate , where a periodic reversal of the @xmath28 sign allows quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) . by an appropriate choice of the inversion period ( @xmath29 )",
    ", one can quasi - phase - match practically any desired non - linear interaction .",
    "note that spe preserves the reversed domains , integrity and permits low propagation losses while leading to a high index variation of about 0.03 .",
    "the non - degenerate twin photons are emitted collinearly in the same spatial mode , making the collection easier using single - mode fibres .",
    "pumping with a pulsed laser at 712 nm , qpm conditions for generating non - degenerate photons at 1310 nm and 1560 nm are obtained for @xmath30 m and a temperature of the sample of about 50@xmath31c .",
    "the bandwidth of the down - converted photons is @xmath2530 nm fwhm .",
    "we obtain a conversion rate of about @xmath32 pairs per pump photon  @xcite .",
    "we measure the device overall efficiency for single photon generation and transmittance . only a few mw of pump power are required to reach @xmath33 per pulse .",
    "the overall losses are measured to be on the order of @xmath2513db , and are dispatched as follows : @xmath253db for mode matching , @xmath256db for limited wdm extinction ratios and on - chip propagation , and @xmath254db for collection efficiency and filtering stage .",
    "we perform a classical characterization of the mzi phase range ( see fig .",
    "[ phasevsvoltage ] ) and identify two extreme and complementary working points for @xmath34  0v and @xmath35  10v , allowing to reach the product state @xmath36 and the n00n state @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "after the calibration of the mzi is accurately performed , the phase is tuned accordingly to the graph in fig .",
    "[ phasevsvoltage ] .    ]",
    "the pump laser ( coherent mira 900  d ) emits 1.2ps - duration , time - bandwidth limited ( @xmath38 0.24 nm ) pulses , at the wavelength of 712 nm , and at a repetition rate of 76mhz .",
