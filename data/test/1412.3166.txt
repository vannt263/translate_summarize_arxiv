    "non - spherical particles moving in turbulent flows are of fundamental importance for many different scientific problems .",
    "examples are rain initiation by ice crystals in turbulent clouds @xcite , fiber suspensions @xcite , grain dynamics in accretion disks @xcite , and pattern formation on the surface of turbulent and complex flows @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by the problem of describing plankton dynamics in aquatic ecosystems .",
    "the dynamics of plankton in turbulent flows are of interest because plankton occupy the lowest marine trophic level and also significantly affect the contribution of the ocean to the global carbon budget @xcite .",
    "these vital ecological functions are inextricably tied to the mechanical interactions between individual plankters and the complex flow environment they occupy .",
    "rotation of planktonic organisms is critical for chemotaxis @xcite , and plays an important role in diffusive nutrient uptake @xcite .",
    "the physical and biological effects of rotation continue to be a subject of inquiry , along with other kinematic factors that have clearly been shown to influence feeding , reproduction , and predator - avoidance @xcite .",
    "rotating axisymmetric particles may tumble , or spin , or both .",
    "the term tumbling denotes the orientational dynamics of the symmetry axis of the particle , while the term spinning denotes the rotation of the particle around its own symmetry axis .",
    "tumbling of non - spherical particles has received attention recently @xcite , but spinning is an equally important part of rotation .",
    "for example , inertial particles do not simply sample fluid vorticity and strain , but rather extract angular momentum , transport it , and ` return ' it to the fluid phase .",
    "how this occurs likely depends upon how the total angular velocity of the particle is distributed between tumbling and spinning .",
    "the rotations of small particles suspended in linear shear flows have been studied intensively , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in this context spinning",
    "is referred to as log rolling .",
    "here we consider particles suspended in turbulent flows and evaluate the effects of turbulence upon rotation , tumbling , and spinning .",
    "we consider simple shapes ( spheroids and cylinders ) with uniform distribution of mass , and particle sizes within either the dissipative or inertial subrange of turbulence .",
    "these ranges correspond roughly to the lower and upper bounds of body size of planktonic organisms .",
    "two representative groups of plankton , spanning this range of length scales , are diatoms ( class bacillariophyceae , @xmath0-@xmath1 @xmath2 m ) and comb jellies ( phylum ctenophora , @xmath3-@xmath4 cm ) .",
    "most diatoms move only by drifting , and are usually smaller than the kolmogorov length scale of oceanic turbulence .",
    "comb jellies locomote by a combination of active swimming and passive drifting , and their sizes typically lie within the inertial subrange of turbulence .",
    "some diatoms can alter their nutrient uptake , settling velocity , or collision frequency by forming colonies with a variety of shapes . in comb jellies ,",
    "different body plans are correlated with different propulsion and predation modes , and we hypothesize that shape is very important for drifting - mode locomotion as well . a beautiful diversity of shapes has been observed for diatoms , diatom colonies , and comb jellies , extending from oblate to prolate forms .",
    "fore - aft symmetry is especially common in diatoms , and frequently found in comb jellies if we consider them in silhouette , _",
    "i.e. _ neglecting the placement of feeding appendages .",
    "axisymmetry is also common among diatoms and many orders of comb jellies .",
    "herein we focus on the basic question of passive shape - rotation interactions , upon which studies of active locomotion can build .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of shape upon the rotation of particles in turbulence , their tumbling , and their spinning .",
    "we report results of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of particles rotating in turbulent flows , statistical - model calculations , and experiments .",
    "these results enable us to characterize how the orientational dynamics of rods and disks are qualitatively very different ( section [ sec : traj ] ) .",
    "but we also show that , despite these significant differences , the variance of angular velocity is almost shape - independent ( section [ sec : ensemble ] ) .",
    "we show that these results are due to the inherent nature of the turbulence , by comparing the dns results to those obtained in a random - flow model with finite correlation length and time ( section  [ sec : randomflow ] ) .",
    "finally we discuss laboratory results quantifying the rotation rate of large particles in turbulence ( particles whose sizes fall in the inertial range of turbulence ) .",
    "these results show that the angular - velocity variance of large particles at relatively low aspect ratio is shape - independent too , thus extending our results concerning the dissipative range ( section  [ sec : experiment ] ) .    before describing these results in detail",
    "we introduce the notation and briefly mention previous work in section  [ sec : background ] .",
    "methods are discussed in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "[ sec : background ]    we consider cylinders and spheroids .",
    "both shapes are characterized by an axis of symmetry ( length @xmath5 ) and two other axes of equal lengths @xmath6 .",
    "the aspect ratio is defined as @xmath7 .",
    "the particle orientation is defined by the unit vector @xmath8 that points along the axis of symmetry of the particle .",
    "the vector @xmath8 evolves according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angular velocity of the particle and the dot denotes a time derivative .",
    "the particle angular velocity @xmath10 can be decomposed into components parallel and orthogonal to @xmath8 .",
    "the magnitude of the parallel component , @xmath11 , describes the rate at which the particle spins around its symmetry axis , the spinning rate .",
    "the magnitude of the orthogonal component , @xmath12 , is called the tumbling rate .",
    "it is the combined rotation rate about the equatorial particle axes .",
    "we consider the case of isotropic turbulence in the absence of external body forces .",
    "thus the steady  state statistics of the angular velocity vector @xmath10 is isotropic . in particular @xmath13 .",
    "the variance of @xmath10 is thus simply @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , since we consider particles with fore - aft symmetry , the averages of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 must also vanish because @xmath17 represents the same physical configuration as @xmath8 .",
    "thus the variances of the tumbling and spinning rates are simply @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    from the above definitions it follows that the squared rotation , tumbling and spinning rates obey a kinematic relationship : the total rotation rate squared is the sum of the squared tumbling and spinning rates , @xmath20 it follows by averaging eq .",
    "( [ eq : decompose ] ) that the same relationship holds for the variances .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath8 have been studied by a number of authors .",
    "it has been shown that this orientation vector preferentially aligns with the strain and vorticity directions of the flow , depending on particle shape @xcite .",
    "the tumbling rate is readily observed in experiments @xcite , and its probability distribution and dependence on particle shape are known @xcite .",
    "less is known about the spinning rate and the total angular velocity of axisymmetric particles suspended in turbulent flows .",
    "our goals here are to qualitatively describe the dynamics and compare the distributions of these different rotation variables over a range of particle aspect ratios .",

    "the parameter @xmath31 characterizes the shape of the particle : @xmath32 for spheres , @xmath33 for infinitely thin rods , and @xmath34 for infinitely thin disks .",
    "most numerical studies that use this approach focus on rod - like particles @xcite , but some studies also consider oblate spheroids  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : dotn ] ) shows that spherical particles ( @xmath32 ) respond only to the vorticity of the fluid , while non  spherical particles are affected by the fluid strain as well .",
    "the results shown below were obtained using time ",

    "we disregard the initial transient by discarding data corresponding to the first @xmath42@xmath41 for each trajectory .",
    "distributions of the particle angular velocity and its spinning and tumbling rates are computed from the remaining data .",
    "the dns shows that the variances of rotation , spinning , and tumbling rates rapidly approach their steady - state values , in most cases within @xmath42@xmath41 ( not shown ) .",
    "but the results summarized in appendix [ sec : orthogonality ] show that differences in the rotation between prolate and oblate particles may take longer to develop for near  spherical particles .",
    "it is instructive to compare the dns results for particle rotation in turbulent flows with those obtained for particles rotating in an isotropic homogeneous gaussian random velocity field with appropriate correlation length and correlation time .",
    "this comparison shows which aspects of particle spinning and tumbling are influenced by the nature of turbulence , and which aspects can be explained by a simple statistical model .",
    "an important difference between turbulence and a random gaussian velocity field is that turbulence breaks time - reversal invariance , such that the fluid - velocity gradient matrix @xmath27 and its transpose @xmath43 appear with different probabilities @xcite . in the statistical model , by contrast , @xmath27 and @xmath43 appear with equal probabilities .",
    "this is important for our question because the orientational dynamics of rods and disks are determined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "this follows from two observations .",
    "first the orientational equation of motion ( [ eq : tumble_rate],[eq : dotn ] ) can be recast as @xmath46 .",
    "second , the non - linear term on right  hand side of this equation determines only the normalization of @xmath8 but not its orientation ( see appendix [ sec : orthogonality ] ) .",
    "further differences between turbulence and random flow arise from the fact that turbulent flows exhibit much more violent vorticity fluctuations than random flows exhibit .",
    "this is important for our question because long - lived vortex structures @xcite cause the particles to align , affecting the relation between spinning and tumbling rates @xcite .",
    "our statistical model has two dimensionless parameters , the shape factor @xmath47 and a second parameter that is formed out of the correlation length @xmath48 of the fluid velocity , its correlation time @xmath49 , and its typical speed @xmath50 .",
    "this parameter is referred to as the kubo number @xmath51 .",
    "it is a dimensionless measure of the correlation time of the fluid velocity field .",
    "the incompressible random velocity field is represented as follows@xcite .",
    "we write @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a gaussian random vector potential with zero mean , gaussian spatial correlation function with correlation length @xmath48 , and exponential time correlations @xmath54 .",
    "this stochastic model is difficult to solve in closed form because the orientational dynamics are determined by the lagrangian correlations of the fluid - velocity gradients .",
    "the tumbling rate can be computed approximately by perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an expansion in the kubo number .",
    "up to the sixth order in @xmath55 , the tumbling rate is given by@xcite : @xmath56 the lowest - order term was obtained earlier @xcite . in a similar way the variance of the particle angular velocity can be computed .",
    "we find : @xmath57 and @xmath58 the terms in these perturbation expansions contain only even powers of @xmath55 .",
    "the perturbation series ( [ eq : p1 ] ) to ( [ eq : p3 ] ) are asymptotically divergent , _",
    "i.e. _ they diverge for any fixed value of @xmath55 but every partial sum of the series approaches the correct result as @xmath59 . to obtain accurate results at larger kubo numbers requires resummation of the series .",
    "we have obtained the series expansions to order eight , making it possible to resum the series using pad - borel resummation@xcite .      the methods described above assume that particles are infinitesimally small , so that their rotation is always determined by the local fluid - velocity gradients .",
    "the rotation of larger particles is influenced by their interactions with the non - linear fluid - velocity field .",
    "furthermore , the inertia of finite - size particles feeds back to the fluid phase . for an axisymmetric particle in simple shear flow ,",
    "particle and fluid inertia make substantial contributions to the orientational motion @xcite .",

    "all of these mechanisms potentially invalidate the arguments concerning preferential alignment , so we do not know , _ a priori _ , whether large particles will show shape ",
    "dependent rotation that resembles our observations for small particles .    our results for the total rotation rate of large particles",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] . within experimental error ,",
    "the shape - dependence of the average total rotation rate is consistent with our findings in section  [ sec : smallparticles ] .",
    "this remarkable fact remains to be explained .",
    "it is expected that the rotation - rate variance is smaller for large particles ( because they average over fluid - velocity gradients ) .",
    "this is borne out by the experiment : it shows a variance that is approximately a factor of @xmath137 smaller than the dns variance ( note that we plot @xmath138 for the experiment and @xmath139 for the dns , which differ by a factor of @xmath66 ) .",
    "previous work@xcite has successfully predicted the tumbling rate variance of high - aspect - ratio rods in the inertial subrange , showing that rod length controls the tumbling rate .",
    "however , extending this approach to low - aspect - ratio rods and disks is non - trivial .",
    "if rod rotation scaling were based on one lengthscale only , we would expect a significant difference in the angular velocity variance for the particles with @xmath140 and @xmath141 , which here have @xmath5=16@xmath48 and @xmath5=38@xmath48 respectively .",
    "however , we observe no significant change in angular velocity variance .",
    "this suggests that dynamics of inertial , low - aspect - ratio rods are not accurately predicted by a single lengthscale .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the rotation of axisymmetric particles in turbulence by experiments , direct numerical simulations , and random - flow model calculations . we have found that disks rotate very differently from rods in regions of intense vorticity in turbulence .",
    "while the symmetry axis of a rod follows closely the second strain eigenvector @xmath113 and vorticity , the symmetry axis of the disk tumbles in the plane spanned by @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the strain eigenvectors corresponding to the largest extensional and largest compressional eigenvalues .",
    "rods spin around their own symmetry axis at a rate of half the vorticity , while fluid vorticity and strain act to make disks tumble . in other words , because of their different alignment with respect to fluid vorticity , rods tend to spin more than they tumble , while disks tend to tumble more than they spin .",
    "this has important implications for the instantaneous rotation dynamics in turbulence .",
    "the strain makes only a small contribution to the rotation of rods , while for disks it makes a large contribution : it tends to rotate the symmetry vector of disks around the vorticity vector , sometimes decelerating , sometimes accelerating the rotation .    despite this qualitative difference , the variance of the total rotation rate is almost independent of shape .",
    "in fact , the rotation rate variance of a disk is neither more nor less than that of a sphere .",
    "this exact equivalence is unexpected . also , prolate particles rotate with nearly the same angular velocity variance as disks and spheres .",
    "this is borne out by both dns and experiments , for small and large particles respectively .",
    "we also demonstrated by a random - flow calculation that our observations in turbulence are not a feature of the equations of motion , but depend on the distinguishing statistical features of turbulence in a lagrangian frame . in the random - flow model",
    "the rotation rate variance depends on shape , and the preferential alignment between fluid vorticity and the symmetry axes of particles is very weak .",
    "several aspects of particle rotation in turbulence remain to be understood .",
    "an important open question concerns the alignment of disks , rods , and vorticity with the eigen ",
    "system @xmath142 of the strain - rate matrix , @xmath143 .",
    "the time - delayed correlations @xmath144 shed some light on the vorticity dynamics@xcite , but is there a corresponding ` pirouette effect ' for disks ? a second important question is to understand the effect of finite particle sizes .",
    "our results from dns and the statistical model pertain to tracer particles .",
    "finite - size corrections and the effects of particle and fluid inertia to the particle - rotation rate remain to be understood . a third question to consider is the implication of our results concerning the rotation and alignment of less symmetric particles such as ellipsoids with three distinct moments of inertia or non - ellipsoidal particles .",
    "a major motivation for this investigation is the effect of shape upon the dynamics of planktonic organisms .",
    "the relationships between the shape of a planktonic organism , its kinematics in flow , and its biological success are quite complex , but our results can contribute a few facts to this ongoing investigation .",
    "first , shape does not control how much angular velocity an organism inherits from the ambient turbulence on average , but it does control how this angular velocity is distributed about the organism s principal axes .",
    "this may impact swimming behavior according to the directionality of the propulsive system employed ( directional , as in copepods , or omnidirectional , as in cydippid ctenophores ) .",
    "second , it is tempting to label planktonic species as either spinners  or tumblers  based on their shape , but this nomenclature can not be taken too literally : our results indicate that shape can only _ emphasize _ spinning or tumbling , it can not select one exclusively . in other words ,",
    "even the most extreme tumblers show a fair bit of spinning , and vice versa .",
    "potential reasons for an organism to emphasize tumbling over spinning may include mass transfer , swimming , or gyrotaxis @xcite .",
    "third , if an organism or colony were to emphasize spinning or tumbling by changing its shape , the greatest marginal return occurs when aspect ratio is near unity .",
    "once an organism departs significantly ( by a factor of @xmath42 ) from this ratio , further shape changes have no effect on rotation .",
    "spheroidal body plans with aspect ratios near unity ( @xmath145 ) are commonly observed in cydippid ctenophores , which places them in the range for which small changes in shape will greatly influence rotation .",
    "this is suggestive that shape may play a major role in their behavior and locomotion . of course ,",
    "continued cross  disciplinary study is needed to elucidate the full impact of body shape on plankton biology in complex flows .",
    "herein we have described some of the passive physical mechanisms involved , and future work may build upon this foundation , investigating how and whether aquatic organisms take advantage of these mechanisms .    _",
