    "lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations indicate that there is a transition of nuclear matter from confined to deconfined quarks and gluons at a temperature of order @xmath3 mev .",
    "characteristic of this deconfined state of matter is the dynamic screening of the long - range confining potential of qcd .",
    "color screening is predicted to reduce the attraction between heavy quark - antiquark pairs , and thus leads to a decrease in the ratio of hidden charm and beauty ( quarkonia ) to open charm and beauty  @xcite .",
    "thus , one expects a suppression of quarkonium states ( @xmath4 ) depending on their binding energy and the temperature of the surrounding system .    in relativistic heavy ion collisions a state of a deconfined thermalized quark - gluon plasma may be created .",
    "measurements in pb - pb reactions at @xmath1 = 17.3 gev by the na50 experiment  @xcite show a suppression of heavy quarkonia production relative to `` normal '' nuclear absorption , the dissociation of @xmath5 pairs by interactions with the nucleons into separate quarks that eventually hadronize into @xmath6 mesons  @xcite .",
    "this suppression has been interpreted in the context of color screening in a quark - gluon plasma  @xcite , additional absorption with co - moving hadrons  @xcite , and multiple scattering between the charm quarks and the surrounding medium  @xcite .    at rhic energies , where of order 10 @xmath5 pairs are produced in central au - au reactions  @xcite ,",
    "some models predict an enhancement of heavy quarkonia due to @xmath5 coalescence in a quark - gluon plasma  @xcite , detailed balance of @xmath7  @xcite , and/or statistical @xmath0 production  @xcite .",
    "in addition , at rhic energies initial state effects of shadowing and possible parton saturation may play a role in initial charm production  @xcite . disentangling these competing effects will require a systematic study of yields of various quarkonium states in different colliding systems ( proton - proton , proton ( or deuteron)-ion , and ion - ion ) and over a wide kinematic range in terms of transverse momentum and @xmath8 .",
    "we report here the first results on @xmath0 production via electron - positron decay pairs at mid - rapidity from au - au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev from data taken during run-2 at rhic in 2001 . for peripheral and mid - central au - au collisions , we present the most probable yield values , while for central reactions",
    ", we observe no signal above background and thus quote 90% confidence level upper limits on @xmath0 production .",
    "the phenix experiment is specifically designed to make use of high luminosity ion - ion , proton - ion , and proton - proton collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider to sample rare physics probes including the @xmath0 and other heavy quarkonium states .",
    "the phenix experiment includes two central rapidity spectrometer arms , each covering the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath9 and an interval of 90 degrees in azimuthal angle @xmath10 .",
    "the spectrometers are comprised from the inner radius outward of a multiplicity and vertex detector ( mvd ) , drift chambers ( dc ) , pixel pad chambers ( pc ) , ring imaging cerenkov counters ( rich ) , time - of - flight scintillator wall ( tof ) , time expansion chambers ( tec ) , and two types of electromagnetic calorimeters ( emc ) .",
    "this combination of detectors allows for the clean identification of electrons over a broad range in transverse momentum .",
    "further details of the detector design and performance are given in  @xcite .",
    "the au - au event centrality is estimated using the combined data from our beam - beam counters ( bbc ) and zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) . while the zdcs measure forward neutrons that result from fragmentation of the colliding nuclei , the bbcs are sensitive to charged particles produced in the collisions .",
    "together , both detectors yield information on the impact parameter of the nuclear reaction  @xcite . these observables , combined with a glauber model for the nuclear geometry , allow us to determine different collision geometry categories , referred to as centrality ranges  @xcite .    for the analysis presented here , the electron ( positron ) momentum and charge sign",
    "is determined from tracking using the dc and the pc and then projecting back through the phenix axial magnetic field to the collision point determined by the bbc  @xcite .",
    "the momentum resolution achieved is @xmath11  ( in gev / c ) .",
    "electrons are cleanly separated from the large background of charged pions and kaons by associating the tracks with at least three active photomultiplier tubes in the rich  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we compare the track momentum ( @xmath12 ) to the energy ( @xmath13 ) measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter . the @xmath14 ratio is used to further reduce the pion contamination in the electron sample .",
    "pions typically deposit only a fraction of their energy in the calorimeter whereas electrons deposit all of their energy .",
    "these selections are augmented by requiring that the calorimeter shower position and time - of - flight information agree with the track projection .",
    "thus , we obtain a clean sample of electron and positron candidates with less than 5% contamination .",
    "the au - au data at @xmath15 gev used in this analysis were recorded during run 2 at rhic in the fall of 2001 . for our `` minimum bias '' au - au event selection",
    ", we use a level-1 trigger that requires a coincidence between our bbcs .",
    "we place an additional offline requirement of at least one forward neutron in each of our zdcs to remove beam related backgrounds .",
    "our `` minimum bias '' sample includes 92% of the 6.9 barn au - au inelastic cross section  @xcite .",
    "we further restrict our analysis to 90% of the inelastic cross section to remove a small remaining contribution from beam related background events .",
    "we observed a au - au inelastic collision rate that increased during the running period from 100 to 1200 hz .",
    "the level-2 triggers are implemented in a personal computer - based farm with 30 processors in run 2 , as part of the phenix event builder  @xcite .",
    "the level-2 @xmath0 trigger algorithm identified electron candidates by starting with rings in the rich and then searching for possible matching showers in the emc . the emc search window based on the rich ring",
    "is obtained from a lookup table , generated using monte carlo simulations of single electrons .",
    "possible matches were assumed to be electron candidates , and the electron momentum was taken to be the emc shower energy .",
    "the invariant mass was calculated for all electron candidate pairs within an event , regardless of the candidate s charge sign .",
    "if the invariant mass was higher than 2.2 @xmath16 , the pair was accepted as a @xmath0 candidate , and the entire event was archived .",
    "the level-2 trigger provided a rejection factor of order 30 relative to our `` minimum bias '' level-1 trigger sample .",
    "an additional offline requirement was imposed that the collisions have a z - vertex satisfying @xmath17 in order to eliminate collisions taking place near the phenix magnet .",
    "after this selection , we have analyzed 25.9 million `` minimum bias '' au - au reactions as triggered by our bbc level-1 trigger .",
    "in addition , from the high luminosity period of running , we also processed 23.4 million `` minimum bias '' events with our @xmath0 level-2 trigger .",
    "for three exclusive centrality bins , 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% , and 40 - 90% of the total au - au cross section , we show the dielectron invariant mass distributions for unlike sign pairs ( @xmath18 ) , like sign pairs ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) and the subtracted difference in figure  [ fig : mass ] . the number of @xmath0 counts for each centrality range is determined from the number of signal counts above `` background '' within a fixed invariant mass window .",
    "the phenix acceptance and level-2 trigger efficiencies are the same within a few percent for unlike sign pairs and like sign pairs in the @xmath0 mass region .",
    "therefore , the sample of like sign pairs is a good representation with no additional scale factor of the `` background '' due to simple combinatorics .        in order to extract a @xmath0 signal strength ,",
    "we employ a counting method where we subtract from the number of unlike sign pairs the number of like sign pairs in the mass window @xmath21 @xmath16 .",
    "we have chosen a wide invariant mass window to be consistent with the signal extraction method from our proton - proton analysis  @xcite , and to limit our sensitivity to the exact mass width value .",
    "although we expect from our monte carlo studies a mass width of order 60 mev , we can not quantitatively verify this even with our proton - proton data sample due to low statistics .",
    "we note that in principle there is more information to be utilized in the exact distribution of the candidates within the mass window .",
    "however , we have found that this does not add to the significance of the result given the low counts and the lack of constraint on the @xmath0 and background line shape .",
    ".[tab : counts ] statistical results for @xmath0 counts are shown for three exclusive centrality ranges .",
    "shown are the number of unlike and like sign counts within the mass window ( @xmath22 ) . also shown",

    "although @xmath29 is normalized such that @xmath32 , it has a non - zero probability for negative expected net signal value ( @xmath33 ) . since the unlike sign contains @xmath34 , and the like sign contains only @xmath35 , the only physically allowed values for @xmath36 are greater than or equal to zero .",
    "thus , we remove the probability range corresponding to @xmath33 , and re - normalize the remaining probability integral to one  @xcite , as shown in the same figure  [ fig : stats ] .",
    "we then determine for each centrality the 90% confidence level upper limit , and the 68% confidence interval around the most likely value for the peripheral and mid - central ranges .",

    "vertical lines are shown to indicate the most likely value ( 8) , the 68% confidence interval values , and the 90% confidence level upper limit . ]    since the net signal is negative for the 0 - 20% central event class , we can only quote a 90% confidence level upper limit . also , even for the 20 - 40% and 40 - 90% centrality classes , the signal observed is not significant at the two standard deviation level and thus we also show 90% confidence level upper limits for completeness . the limited statistical significance of the results is clear from the mass distributions shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .    in the intermediate mass region below the @xmath0 , @xmath39 , the shapes and absolute yield of like sign and unlike sign dielectron mass distributions are well reproduced by an event mixing method within a few percent .",
    "this indicates that most of the dielectron pairs are from uncorrelated electron and positron candidates .",
    "they are originating from dalitz decays , photon conversions , open charm / beauty semi - leptonic decays , and a small contamination of mis - identified hadrons .",
    "the unlike sign pairs should also have a component from semi - leptonic decays of charm and anti - charm pairs , but its contribution is less than the statistical uncertainty of the data  @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the intermediate mass region will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "our method of measurement does not separate contributions from decay feed - down from other states such as the @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and thus our @xmath0 counts include these feed down sources .",
    "our acceptance and efficiency is identical for the resulting @xmath0 from these decays as for prompt @xmath0 , and thus they enter our signal weighted simply by their relative production and branching fraction into @xmath42 .",
    "another contribution may result from @xmath43 meson decays into @xmath0 .",
    "however , if we assume a @xmath44 cross section in proton - proton reactions @xmath45  @xcite and that beauty production scales with binary collisions , we would expect a contribution of order 1 - 4% relative to primary @xmath0 or @xmath0 from @xmath40 .",
    "this percentage contribution calculation assumes that the primary @xmath0 also scales with binary collisions .",
    "if primary @xmath0 are substantially suppressed , the @xmath43 meson decay contribution would constitute a larger fraction of our measured @xmath0 , especially at higher @xmath46 .",
    "it should also be noted that some signal in the unlike sign pairs from correlated open charm @xmath47 will contribute in our mass window .",
    "assuming binary scaling in charm production with a proton - proton cross section @xmath48  @xcite , this contribution in the @xmath0 mass region is estimated to be about 0.1 events in the 0 - 20% , 0.05 events in the 20 - 40% , and 0.02 events in the 40 - 90% centrality bins .",
    "we quote our results as the branching fraction of @xmath49 ( b=@xmath50  @xcite ) times the invariant yield at mid - rapidity @xmath51 .",
    "we calculate this quantity for three exclusive centrality ranges as detailed below .",
    "@xmath52    the number of signal counts @xmath53 from both the `` minimum bias '' and level-2 triggered event samples are shown in table  [ tab : counts ] .",
    "the number of events from the `` minimum bias '' sample @xmath54 is 25.9 million au - au events .",
    "the number of effective events sampled by the level-2 trigger is @xmath55 , which is the level-2 trigger efficiency times the number of events processed by the level-2 trigger , 23.4 million au - au events .",
    "this formulation appropriately weights the two data samples by the expected number of @xmath0 .",
    "the efficiency of the level-2 trigger @xmath56 was determined by running the trigger algorithm on simulated @xmath0 and carrying out a full offline reconstruction of the resulting electron - positron decay pair .",
    "the efficiency was calculated via counting the fraction of successfully reconstructed @xmath0 events that were also found by the trigger . in these trigger simulations ,",
    "the channel - by - channel calibrations for the rich and emc were used to convert the simulated signals into realistic values representative of a specific period in the run , before passing them to the level-2 trigger .",
    "the overall @xmath0 trigger efficiency from the trigger simulations was @xmath56 = 0.75 @xmath57 0.04 .",
    "the systematic error was determined by studying the dependence of the trigger efficiency on the collision vertex position , the assumed @xmath0 transverse momentum and rapidity distribution , collision centrality , and the period of the run from which the channel - by - channel calibrations were taken . after evaluating all of the above dependencies ,",
    "we assign a 5% systematic error to the @xmath0 trigger efficiency .",
    "the efficiency result from the trigger simulations was confirmed using real data in two ways .",
    "first , the minimum bias data sample in au - au collisions was analysed to calculate the @xmath0 trigger efficiency .",
    "this was done by taking the ratio of the events that have an electron pair with invariant mass between 2.8 and 3.4 @xmath16 that fired the @xmath0 trigger to all of the events having electron pairs in that invariant mass range .",
    "the trigger efficiency estimate from this check is 0.67 @xmath57 0.10  ( stat ) .",
    "second , the triggers were run on a sample of 26 events from the proton - proton data set that passed all of the @xmath0 cuts in the offline analysis and had invariant masses between 2.8 and 3.4 @xmath16 .",
    "the level-2 @xmath0 trigger accepted 19 of these events , yielding an estimate of @xmath58 ( stat ) , in very good agreement with the trigger simulation result .",
    "these results verify that the trigger performance is similar for real data and simulations .",
    "the @xmath0 acceptance and efficiency @xmath59 is determined with a geant based monte carlo simulation of the phenix experiment .",
    "the detector response has been tuned to reproduce the resolution and performance of the real detector .",
    "the efficiency includes not only the tracking efficiency , but also the probability for passing all of the electron identification selection cuts .",
    "the electron identification efficiency determined by the monte carlo is verified by a clean electron sample from conversion photons",
    ". we also account for run by run efficiency changes by counting the relative number of reconstructed electrons and positrons per event in our data sample .",
    "we show the phenix acceptance and efficiency as a function of transverse momentum in figure  [ fig : accept ] .     the phenix @xmath0 acceptance @xmath60 efficiency as a function of the @xmath0 transverse momentum is shown .",
    "most of the acceptance is with one lepton into each of the two phenix central spectrometers",
    ". this contribution peaks at @xmath61 and decreases with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "the rise in the acceptance at high @xmath46 is from contributions where both electron and positron are accepted into one of the phenix central spectrometers . ]    since we do not have the statistics to determine the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0 , we must employ a model for the @xmath46 dependence to determine an overall acceptance and efficiency .",
    "we use two different functional forms for the @xmath46 distributions to test the model sensitivity of our acceptance .",
    "we use an exponential in @xmath46 and an exponential in @xmath62 as motivated by fits to @xmath0 data at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "the two models give similar acceptance values given a common @xmath63 value input .",
    "the largest uncertainty comes from the value of @xmath63 assumed .",
    "phenix has measured @xmath0 production in proton - proton reactions at @xmath64 = 200 gev and finds a @xmath63 = @xmath65 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "we use this value to determine our acceptance and efficiency averaged over all @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath63 in au - au collisions may differ from that in proton - proton reactions .",
    "therefore we vary the @xmath63 from 1.0 to 3.0 gev / c to determine our model dependent systematic errors .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 rapidity distribution is flat over the range @xmath66 where we measure .",
    "the final value for the @xmath0 acceptance and efficiency is shown in table  [ tab : eff ] .",
    "this acceptance and efficiency has a 20% systematic error from uncertainties in matching the monte carlo to the detector response , a 10% systematic error from run - to - run variation corrections , and a @xmath67% systematic error from the uncertainty in the @xmath63 .",

    "<S> for this analysis we have studied 49.3 million minimum bias au - au reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we present the @xmath0 invariant yield @xmath2 for peripheral and mid - central reactions . for the most central collisions where we observe no signal above background , we quote 90% confidence level upper limits . </S>",
