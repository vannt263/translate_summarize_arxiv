    "general relativity and ordinary differential geometry should be replaced by non - commutative geometry at some point between the currently accessible energies of about 1 - 10 tev ( after starting the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ) and the planck scale , which is @xmath2 times higher , where space - time and gravity should be quantized .",
    "this could occur either at the planck scale or below .",
    "quantum field theory on a non - commutative space - time ( ncqf ) could very well be an intermediate theory relevant for physics at energies between the lhc and the planck scale .",
    "it certainly looks intermediate in structure between ordinary quantum field theory on commutative @xmath3 and string theory , the current leading candidate for a more fundamental theory including quantized gravity .",
    "ncqft in fact appears as an effective model for certain limits of string theory @xcite .    in joint work with r. gurau , j. magnen and f. vignes - tourneret @xcite , using direct space methods , we provided recently a new proof that the grosse - wulkenhaar scalar @xmath4 theory on the moyal space @xmath5 is renormalisable to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the grosse - wulkenhaar breakthrough @xcite was to realize that the right propagator in non - commutative field theory is not the ordinary commutative propagator , but has to be modified to obey langmann - szabo duality @xcite .",
    "grosse and wulkenhaar were able to compute the corresponding propagator in the so called `` matrix base '' which transforms the moyal product into a matrix product .",
    "this is a real _ tour de force _ !",
    "they use this representation to prove perturbative renormalisability of the theory up to some estimates which were finally proven in @xcite .",
    "our direct space method builds upon the previous works of filk and chepelev - roiban @xcite .",
    "these works however remained inconclusive @xcite , since these authors used the right interaction but not the right propagator , hence the problem of ultraviolet / infrared mixing prevented them from obtaining a finite renormalised perturbation series .",
    "we also extend the grosse - wulkenhaar results to more general models with covariant derivatives in a fixed magnetic field @xcite .",
    "our proof relies on a multiscale analysis analogous to @xcite but in direct space .",
    "non - commutative field theories ( for a general review see @xcite ) deserve a thorough and systematic investigation , not only because they may be relevant for physics beyond the standard model , but also ( although this is often less emphasized ) because they can describe effective physics in our ordinary standard world but with non - local interactions .    in this case",
    "there is an interesting reversal of the initial grosse - wulkenhaar problematic . in the @xmath4 theory on the moyal space @xmath5 ,",
    "the vertex is sort of god - given by the moyal structure , and it is ls invariant .",
    "the challenge was to overcome uv / ir mixing and to find the right propagator which makes the theory renormalisable .",
    "this propagator turned out to have ls duality .",
    "the harmonic potential introduced by grosse and wulkenhaar can be interpreted as a piece of covariant derivatives in a constant magnetic field .",
    "now to explain the ( fractional ) quantum hall effect , which is a bulk effect whose understanding requires electron interactions , we can almost invert this logic .",
    "the propagator is known since it corresponds to non - relativistic electrons in two dimensions in a constant magnetic field .",
    "it has ls duality .",
    "but the interaction is unclear , and can not be local since at strong magnetic field the spins should align with the magnetic field , hence by pauli principle local interactions among electrons in the first landau level should vanish .",
    "we can argue that among all possible non - local interactions , a few renormalisation group steps should select the only ones which form a renormalisable theory with the corresponding propagator . in the commutative case ( i.e. zero magnetic field ) local interactions such as those of the hubbard model are just renormalisable in any dimension because of the extended nature of the fermi - surface singularity .",
    "since the non - commutative electron propagator ( i.e. in non zero magnetic field ) looks very similar to the grosse - wulkenhaar propagator ( it is in fact a generalization of the langmann - szabo - zarembo propagator ) we can conjecture that the renormalisable interaction corresponding to this propagator should be given by a moyal product .",
    "that s why we hope that non - commutative field theory is the correct framework for a microscopic _ ab initio _ understanding of the fractional quantum hall effect which is currently lacking .    even for regular commutative field theory such as non - abelian gauge theory ,",
    "the strong coupling or non - perturbative regimes may be studied fruitfully through their non - commutative ( i.e. non local ) counterparts .",
    "this point of view is forcefully suggested in @xcite , where a mapping is proposed between ordinary and non - commutative gauge fields which do not preserve the gauge groups but preserve the gauge equivalent classes .",
    "we can at least remark that the effective physics of confinement should be governed by a non - local interaction , as is the case in effective strings or bags models .",
    "in other words we propose to base physics upon the renormalisability principle , more than any other axiom .",
    "renormalisability means genericity ; only renormalisable interactions survive a few rg steps , hence only them should be used to describe generic effective physics of any kind .",
    "the search for renormalisabilty could be the powerful principle on which to orient ourselves in the jungle of all possible non - local interactions .",
    "renormalisability has also attracted considerable interest in the recent years as a pure mathematical structure .",
    "the work of kreimer and connes @xcite recasts the recursive bphz forest formula of perturbative renormalisation in a nice hopf algebra structure .",
    "the renormalisation group ambiguity reminds mathematicians of the galois group ambiguity for roots of algebraic equations .",
    "finding new renormalisable theories may therefore be important for the future of pure mathematics as well as for physics .",
    "that was forcefully argued during the luminy workshop `` renormalisation and galois theory '' .",
    "main open conjectures in pure mathematics such as the riemann hypothesis @xcite or the jacobian conjecture @xcite may benefit from the quantum field theory and renormalisation group approach .    considering that most of the connes - kreimer works uses dimensional regularization and the minimal dimensional renormalisation scheme , it is interesting to develop the parametric representation which generalize schwinger s parametric representation of feynman amplitudes to the non commutative context .",
    "it involves hyperbolic generalizations of the ordinary topological polynomials , which mathematicians call kirchoff polynomials , and physicist call symanzik polynomials in the quantum field theory context @xcite .",
    "we plan also to work out the corresponding regularization and minimal dimensional renormalisation scheme and to recast it in a hopf algebra structure .",
    "the corresponding structures seem richer than in ordinary field theory since they involve ribbon graphs and invariants which contain information about the genus of the surface on which these graphs live .    a critical goal to enlarge the class of renormalisable non - commutative field theories and to attack the quantum hall effect problem is to extend the results of grosse - wulkenhaar to fermionic theories .",
    "the simplest theory , the two - dimensional gross - neveu model can be shown renormalisable to all orders in their langmann - szabo covariant versions , using either the matrix basis @xcite or the direct space version developed here @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath6-space version seems the most promising for a complete non - perturbative construction , using pauli s principle to controll the apparent ( fake ) divergences of perturbation theory .    in the case of @xmath7 , recall that although the commutative version is until now fatally flawed due to the famous landau ghost , there is hope that the non - commutative field theory treated at the perturbative level in this paper may also exist at the constructive level . indeed",
    "a non trivial fixed point of the renormalization group develops at high energy , where the grosse - wulkenhaar parameter @xmath8 tends to 1 , so that langmann - szabo duality become exact , and the beta function vanishes .",
    "this scenario has been checked explicitly to all orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this was done using the matrix version of the theory ; again an @xmath6-space version of renormalisation might be better for a future rigorous non - perturbative investigation of this fixed point and a full constructive version of the model .",
    "finally let us conclude this short introduction by reminding that a very important and difficult goal is to also extend the grosse - wulkenhaar breakthrough to gauge theories .",

    "the equations of motion determine the boundary conditions : @xmath26    boundary conditions for coordinates can be neumann ( @xmath27 ) or dirichlet ( @xmath28 , corresponding to branes ) .",

    "there is an equivalent argument inspired by @xmath35 theory : a rotation sandwiched between two @xmath36 dualities generates the same constant commutator for string coordinates .",
    "the recent progresses concerning the renormalisation of non - commutative field theory have been obtained on a very simple non - commutative space namely the moyal space . from the point of view of quantum field theory , it is certainly the most studied space .",

    "the uv / ir mixing was studied by several groups .",
    "first , chepelev and roiban @xcite gave a power counting for different scalr models .",
    "they were able to identify the divergent graphs and to classify the divergences of the theories thanks to the topological data of the graphs .",
    "then v.  gayral @xcite showed that uv / ir mixing is present on all isospectral deformations ( they consist in curved generalisations of the moyal space and of the non - commutative torus ) . for this , he considered a scalar model and discovered contributions to the effective action which diverge when the external momenta vanish .",
    "the uv / ir mixing is then a general characteristic of the non - commutative theories , at least on the deformations .",

    "we explain now how to do this with minimal effort .",
    "following filk @xcite , we can contract all lines of a spanning tree @xmath36 and reduce @xmath30 to a single vertex with `` tadpole loops '' called a `` rosette graph '' .",
    "this rosette is a cycle ( which is the border of the former tree ) bearing loops lines on it ( see figure [ fig : rosette ] ) :        remark that the rosette can also be considered as a big vertex , with @xmath325 fields , on which @xmath148 are external fields with external variables @xmath6 and @xmath326 are loop fields for the corresponding @xmath327 loops . when the graph is orientable , the rosette is also orientable , which means that turning around the rosette the lines alternatively enter and exit .",
    "these lines correspond to the contraction of the fields on the border of the tree @xmath36 before the filk contraction , also called the `` first filk move '' .",
    "the rosette contribution after a complete first filk reduction is exactly : @xmath330 where the @xmath331 variables are the long or external variables of the rosette , counted with their signs , and the quadratic oscillations for these variables is @xmath332    we have now to analyze in detail this quadratic oscillation of the remaining long loop variables since it is essential to improve power counting . we can neglect the secondary oscillations @xmath333 and @xmath334 which imply short variables .",
    "the second filk reduction @xcite further simplifies the rosette factor by erasing the loops of the rosette which do not cross any other loops or arch over external fields .",
    "it can be shown that the loops which disappear in this operation correspond to those long variables who do not appear in the quadratic form @xmath335 .",
    "the basic mechanism to improve the power counting of a single non - planar subgraph is the following : @xmath336 in these equations we used for simplicity @xmath290 instead of the correct but more complicated factor @xmath337 ( of course this does not change the argument ) and we performed a unitary linear change of variables @xmath338 , @xmath339 to compute the oscillating @xmath340 integral . the gain in ( [ gainoscill ] ) is @xmath341 , which is the difference between @xmath342 and the normal factor @xmath343 that the @xmath344 integral would have cost if we had done it with the regular @xmath345 factor for long variables . to maximize this gain",
    "we can assume @xmath346 .",
    "finally it remains to consider the case of subgraphs which are planar orientable but with more than one external face .",
    "in that case there are no crossing loops in the rosette but there must be at least one loop line arching over a non trivial subset of external legs ( see e.g. line @xmath347 in figure [ fig : rosette ] ) .",
    "we have then a non trivial integration over at least one external variable , called @xmath6 , of at least one long loop variable called @xmath348 .",
    "this `` external '' @xmath6 variable without the oscillation improvement would be integrated with a test function of scale 1 ( if it is a true external line of scale @xmath349 ) or better ( if it is a higher long loop variable ) can not be the full combination of external variables in the `` root '' @xmath97 function . ] .",
    "but we get now @xmath350 so that a factor @xmath315 in the former bound becomes @xmath351 hence is improved by @xmath316 .    in this way we can reduce the convergence of the multiscale analysis to the problem of renormalisation of planar two- and four - point subgraphs with a single external face , which we treat in the next section .",
    "remark that the power counting obtained in this way is still not optimal .",
    "to get the same level of precision than with the matrix base requires e.g. to display @xmath174 independent improvements of the type ( [ gainoscill ] ) for a graph of genus @xmath174 .",
    "this is doable but basically requires a reduction of the quadratic form @xmath335 for single - faced rosette ( also called `` hyperrosette '' ) into @xmath174 standard symplectic blocks through the so - called `` third filk move '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "we return to this question in section [ hyperbo ] .",
    "the idea is that one should compare its amplitude to a similar amplitude with a `` moyal factor '' @xmath352 factorized in front , where @xmath353 .",
    "but precisely because the graph is planar with a single external face we understand that the external positions @xmath6 only couple to _ short variables _ @xmath354 of the internal amplitudes through the global delta function and the oscillations .",
    "hence we can break this coupling by a systematic taylor expansion to first order .",
    "this separates a piece proportional to `` moyal factor '' , then absorbed into the effective coupling constant , and a remainder which has at least one additional small factor which gives him improved power counting .",

    "there is no longer any confining decay for the `` long variables '' but only an oscillation : @xmath376    this kind of models are called critical .",
    "their construction is more difficult , since sufficiently many oscillations must be proven independent before power counting can be established .",
    "the prototype paper which solved this problem is @xcite , which we briefly summarize now .",
    "the main technical difficulty of the critical models is the absence of decreasing functions for the long @xmath331 variables in the propagator replaced by an oscillation , see ( [ eq : criticalpropa ] ) .",
    "note that these decreasing functions are in principle created by integration over the @xmath377 variables .",
    "] : @xmath378 but to perform all these gaussian integrations for a general graph is a difficult task ( see @xcite ) and is in fact not necessary for a bphz theorem .",
    "we can instead exploit the vertices and propagators oscillations to get rationnal decreasing functions in some linear combinations of the long @xmath331 variables .",
    "the difficulty is then to prove that all these linear combinations are independant and hence allow to integrate over all the @xmath331 variables . to solve this problem",
    "we need the exact expression of the total oscillation in terms of the short and long variables .",
    "this consists in a generalization of the filk s work @xcite .",
    "this has been done in @xcite .",
    "once the oscillations are proven independant , one can just use the same arguments than in the @xmath116 case ( see section [ sec : routing - filk - moves ] ) to compute an upper bound for the power counting :    [ lem : compt - puissgn ] let @xmath30 a connected orientable graph . for all @xmath379 ,",
    "there exists @xmath380 such that its amputated amplitude @xmath381 integrated over test functions is bounded by @xmath382    as in the non - commutative @xmath116 case , only the planar graphs are divergent .",
    "but the behaviour of the graphs with more than one broken face is different .",
    "note that we already discussed such a feature in the matrix basis ( see section [ sec : prop - et - renorm ] ) . in the multiscale framework ,",
    "the feynamn diagrams are endowed with a scale attribution which gives each line a scale index .",
    "the only subgraphs we meet in this setting have all their internal scales higher than their external ones .",
    "then a subgraph @xmath383 of scale @xmath269 is called _ critical _ if it has @xmath384 and that the two `` external '' points in the second broken face are only linked by a single line of scale @xmath287 .",
    "the typical example is the graph of figure [ fig : sunseti ] . in this case , the subgrah is logarithmically divergent whereas it is convergent in the @xmath116 model .",
    "let us now show roughly how it happens in the case of figure [ fig : sunseti ] but now in @xmath6-space .",
    "the same arguments than in the @xmath116 model prove that the integrations over the internal points of the graph [ fig : sunseti ] lead to a logarithmical divergence which means that @xmath385 in the multiscale framework . but remind that there is a remaining oscillation between a long variable of this graph and the external points in the second broken face of the form @xmath386 . but @xmath331 is of order @xmath387 which leads to a decreasing function implementing @xmath388 of order @xmath389 .",
    "if these points are true external ones , they are integrated over test functions of norm @xmath349 . then thanks to the additional decreasing function for @xmath388 we gain a factor @xmath290 which makes the graph convergent .",
    "but if @xmath6 and @xmath390 are linked by a single line of scale @xmath287 ( as in figure [ fig : sunsetj ] ) , instead of test functions we have a propagator between @xmath6 and @xmath390 . this one behaves like ( see ): @xmath391 the integration over @xmath388 instead of giving @xmath392 gives @xmath290 thanks to the oscillation @xmath393 .",
    "then we have gained a good factor @xmath394 .",
    "but the oscillation in the propagator @xmath395 now gives @xmath396 instead of @xmath397 and the integration over @xmath398 cancels the preceeding gain .",
    "the critical component of figure [ fig : sunseti ] is logarithmically divergent .",
    "this kind of argument can be repeated and refined for more general graphs to prove that this problem appears only when the extrernal points of the auxiliary broken faces are linked only by a _ single _",
    "lower line @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be seen as a mixing between scales .",
    "indeed the power counting of a given subgraph now depends on the graphs at lower scales .",
    "this was not the case in the commutative realm .",
    "fortunately this mixing does nt prevent renormalisation .",
    "note that whereas the critical subgraphs are not renormalisable by a vertex - like counterterm , they are regularised by the renormalisation of the two - point function at scale @xmath291 .",
    "the proof of this point relies heavily on the fact that there is only one line of lower scale .",
    "let us conclude this section by mentionning the flows of the critical models .",
    "one very interesting feature of the non - commutative @xmath116 model is the boundedness of its flows and even the vanishing of its beta function for a special value of its bare parameters @xcite .",
    "note that its commutative counterpart ( the usual @xmath399 model on @xmath400 ) is asymptotically free in the infrared and has then an unbounded flow .",
    "it turns out that the flow of the critical models are not regularized by the non - commutativity .",
    "the one - loop computation of the beta functions of the non - commutative gross - neveu model @xcite shows that it is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet region as in the commutative case .        in ordinary commutative field theory , symanzik",
    "s polynomials are obtained after integration over internal position variables .",
    "the amplitude of an amputated graph @xmath30 with external momenta @xmath107 is , up to a normalization , in space - time dimension @xmath42 : @xmath401 the first and second symanzik polynomials @xmath402 and @xmath403 are      where the first sum is over spanning trees @xmath36 of @xmath30 and the second sum is over two trees @xmath405 , i.e. forests separating the graph in exactly two connected components @xmath406 and @xmath407 ; the corresponding euclidean invariant @xmath408 is , by momentum conservation , also equal to @xmath409 .",
    "since the mehler kernel is still quadratic in position space it is possible to also integrate explicitly all positions to reduce feynman amplitudes of e.g. non - commutative @xmath7 purely to parametric formulas , but of course the analogs of symanzik polynomials are now hyperbolic polynomials which encode the richer information about ribbon graphs .",
    "the reference for these polynomials is @xcite , which treats the ordinary @xmath7 case . in @xcite ,",
    "these polynomials are also computed in the more complicated case of critical models .    defining the antisymmetric matrix @xmath410",
    "as @xmath411 the @xmath412functions appearing in the vertex contribution can be rewritten as an integral over some new variables @xmath413 .",

    "specializing to dimension 4 and choosing a particular root vertex @xmath415 of the graph , one can write the feynman amplitude for @xmath30 in the condensed way @xmath416^{2 } d\\alpha_{\\ell } \\int d x d p e^{-\\frac { \\omega}{2 } x g x^t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath417 , @xmath418 summarizes all positions and hyermomenta and @xmath30 is a certain quadratic form . if we call @xmath419 and @xmath420 the external variables we can decompose @xmath30 according to an internal quadratic form @xmath335 , an external one @xmath35 and a coupling part @xmath421 so that @xmath422 performing the gaussian integration over all internal variables one obtains : @xmath423^{2 } d\\alpha\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det q } } e^{-\\frac{\\ot}{2 } \\begin{pmatrix } x_e & \\bar{p } \\\\ \\end{pmatrix } [ m - p q^{-1}p^{t } ] \\begin{pmatrix } x_e \\\\ \\bar{p } \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form allows to define the polynomials @xmath424 and @xmath425 , analogs of the symanzik polynomials @xmath354 and @xmath149 of the commutative case ( see ) .",

    "the polynomials @xmath424 and @xmath425 have a strong positivity property . roughly speaking they are sums of monomials with positive integer coefficients .",
    "this positive integer property comes from the fact that each such coefficient is the square of a pfaffian with integer entries , * leading terms can be identified in a given `` hepp sector '' , at least for _",
    "orientable graphs_. a hepp sector is a complete ordering of the @xmath432 parameters .",
    "these leading terms which can be shown strictly positive in @xmath424 correspond to super - trees which are the disjoint union of a tree in the direct graph and a tree in the dual graph .",

    ". moreover note the presence of the @xmath443 term .",
    "its presence can be understood by the fact that in the sector @xmath444 the subgraph formed by the lines @xmath445 has two broken faces .",
    "this is the sign of a power counting improvement due to the additional broken face in that sector . to exploit it",
    ", we have just to integrate over the variables of line @xmath446 in that sector , using the second polynomial @xmath447 for the triangle subgraph @xmath448 made of lines @xmath445 .",
    "non - commutative qft seemed initially to have non - renormalisable divergencies , due to uv / ir mixing .",
    "but following the grosse - wulkenhaar breakthrough , there has been recent rapid progress in our understanding of renormalisable qft on moyal spaces .",
    "we can already propose a preliminary classification of these models into different categories , according to the behavior of their propagators :    * ordinary models at @xmath449 such as @xmath7 ( which has non - orientable graphs ) or @xmath450 models ( which has none ) .",
    "their propagator , roughly @xmath451 is ls covariant and has good decay both in matrix space ( [ th1]-[thsummax ] ) and direct space ( [ tanhyp ] ) .",
    "they have non - logarithmic mass divergencies and definitely require `` vulcanization '' i.e. the @xmath8 term . *",
    "`` supermodels '' , namely ordinary models but at @xmath452 in which the propagator is ls invariant .",
    "their propagator is even better . in the matrix base",
    "it is diagonal , e.g. of the form @xmath453 , where @xmath454 is a constant .",
    "the supermodels seem generically ultraviolet fixed points of the ordinary models , at which non - trivial ward identities force the vanishing of the beta function .",
    "the flow of @xmath8 to the @xmath452 fixed point is very fast ( exponentially fast in rg steps ) .",
    "* `` critical models '' such as orientable versions of lsz or gross - neveu ( and presumably orientable gauge theories of various kind : yang - mills , chern - simons ... ) .",
    "they may have only logarithmic divergencies and apparently no perturbative uv / ir mixing .",
    "however the vulcanized version still appears the most generic framework for their treatment .",
    "the propagator is then roughly @xmath455 . in matrix space",
    "this propagator shows definitely a weaker decay ( [ mainbound1 ] ) than for the ordinary models , because of the presence of a non - trivial saddle point . in direct space",
    "the propagator no longer decays with respect to the long variables , but only oscillates .",
    "nevertheless the main lesson is that in matrix space the weaker decay can still be used ; and in @xmath6 space the oscillations can never be completely killed by the vertices oscillations .",
    "hence these models retain therefore essentially the power counting of the ordinary models , up to some nasty details concerning the four - point subgraphs with two external faces .",
    "ultimately , thanks to a little conspiration in which the four - point subgraphs with two external faces are renormalised by the mass renormalisation , the critical models remain renormalisable .",
    "this is the main message of @xcite .",
    "* `` hypercritical models '' which are of the previous type but at @xmath452 .",
    "their propagator in the matrix base is diagonal and depends only on one index @xmath208 ( e.g. always the left side of the ribbon ) .",
    "it is of the form @xmath456 . in @xmath6 space",
    "the propagator oscillates in a way that often exactly compensates the vertices oscillations .",
    "these models have definitely worse power counting than in the ordinary case , with e.g. quadratically divergent four point - graphs ( if sharp cut - offs are used ) .",
    "nevertheless ward identities can presumably still be used to show that they can still be renormalised .",
    "this probably requires a much larger conspiration to generalize the ward identities of the supermodels .",
    "parametric representation can be derived in the non - commutative case .",
    "it implies hyper - analogs of symanzik polynomials which condense the information about the rich topological structure of a ribbon graph .",
    "using this representation , dimensional regularization and dimensional renormalisation should extend to the non - commutative framework .",
    "remark that trees , which are the building blocks of the symanzik polynomials , are also at the heart of ( commutative ) constructive theory , whose philosophy could be roughly summarized as `` you shall use trees , but you shall _ not _ develop their loops or else you shall diverge '' .",
    "it is quite natural to conjecture that hypertrees , which are the natural non - commutative objects intrinsic to a ribbon graph , should play a key combinatoric role in the yet to develop non - commutative constructive field theory .    in conclusion",
    "we have barely started to scratch the world of renormalisable qft on non - commutative spaces .",
    "the little we see through the narrow window now open is extremely tantalizing .",
    "there exists renormalizable ncqfts eg @xmath457 on @xmath458 , gross - neveu on @xmath459 and they seem to enjoy better propoerties than their commutative counterparts , for instance they no longer have landau ghosts !",
    "non - commutative non relativistic field theories with a chemical potential seem the right formalism for a study ab initio of condensed matter in presence of a magnetic field , and in particular of the quantum hall effect .",
    "the correct scaling and rg theory of this effect presumably requires to build a very singular theory ( of the hypercritical type ) because of the huge degeneracy of the landau levels . to understand this theory and",
