    "lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) processes in the charged sector are highly suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this is due to the non - zero neutrinos masses and to their mixing @xcite .",
    "a sm prediction for bf(@xmath0 ) is approximately 10@xmath4@xcite .",
    "such low bf is virtually unobservable and therefore any positive signal of such reaction would be a clear evidence of new physics .",
    "supersymmetric models - on the other hand - can generate flavour mixing effects @xcite at a level they can be investigate by experiment of the current generation .",
    "we report here on the results of a search for the lfv decay @xmath5 , based on data collected during the 43 days of data acquisition in november and december 2009 by the meg experiment .",
    "the meg experiment is operated at the 590@xmath6mev proton ring cyclotron facility of the paul scherrer institut ( psi ) , in switzerland .",
    "the muons originated from a target stop in the experiment with rate adjusted to be 2.8 @xmath7 hz . in total",
    "approximately 6.5 10@xmath1 muons were stopped on the target and 22 m triggered events acquired .    the smallest limit for the branching ratio br@xmath8 ( 90@xmath9  c.l . ) , was set by the mega experiment  @xcite .",
    "the meg collaboration recently published a limit of the same order of magnitude based on the analysis of the first data collected during 2008@xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 process is characterized by a simple two - body final state , with the positron and photon being emitted in time and back - to - back in the rest frame of the muon , each with an energy equal to half the muon mass .",
    "there are two major sources of background , the dominant being the accidental coincidences between a high energy positron from the principal decay @xmath10 ( michel decay ) and a high energy photon from positron annihilation - in - flight or bremsstrahlung or from the radiative muon decay ( rmd ) @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , a small fraction of rmd is a source of correlated background , producing a high energy photon in time with a positron .",
    "the meg experiment layout combines the use of a continuous muon beam and a high precision detector with excellent spatial , temporal and energy resolutions .",
    "the meg detector covers 10% of the total solid angle and comprises a photon detector and a positron spectrometer .",
    "a schematic of the experiment is shown in fig.1 .",
    "[ fig : layout ]   axis is chosen along the muon beam direction.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a beam of surface muons of 28@xmath6mev / c is separated by the eight times higher positron contamination with a wien filter and then stopped in a thin , slanted polyethylene target , placed at the centre of the detector .",
    "the use of a helium environment ensures minimal multiple scattering for both the muons and the out - going positrons and limits photon background production in the acceptance region .",
    "positrons originating from muon decay are analyzed in the cobra ( constant - bending - radius ) spectrometer consisting of a thin - walled superconducting magnet with a gradient magnetic field and a tracking system of 16 radially aligned modules of low - mass ( @xmath12@xmath13 in total ) drift chambers ( dch ) .",
    "the gradient magnetic field ( 1.27 - 0.49 t ) has larger acceptance for higher momentum particles and minimizes the track - length of charged particles compared to a uniform field .    two fast scintillator bars arrays ( tc )",
    "are placed at each end of the spectrometer and are read at either end by a fine - mesh photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , providing positron timing information and its impact point position .",
    "photons are detected in a 900  litre homogeneous volume of liquid xenon ( lxe ) by measuring the emitted scintillation light with 846 pmts .",
    "lxe has a fast response , large light yield and short radiation length and allows to measure the total energy released by the @xmath14-ray as well as the position and time of its first interaction .",
    "to select matched photon and positron candidates in a high rate , continuous beam environment and store sufficient information for offline analysis requires a well matched system of front - end electronics , trigger processors and data acquisition ( daq ) software . the front - end electronics signals ( 2748 ) are actively split and go to both the trigger and the in - house designed waveform digitizer boards , based on the multi - ghz domino ring sampler chip ( drs ) .",
    "this system achieves an excellent pile - up recognition , together with superior timing and amplitude resolutions , compared to conventional schemes .",
    "the trigger is based on fast information from both tc and lxe requiring an energy deposit in the photon detector in an interval around @xmath15mev , a time coincident positron hit on tc within 20 ns and a rough collinearity of the two particles .",
    "the typical signal event rate was @xmath16  hz , and the total daq rate was @xmath17  hz , with an average livetime of @xmath18 .",
    "the trigger efficiency on signal events is @xmath19% .",
    "calibration and monitoring of the apparatus are key ingredients to reach the sensitivity of @xmath20 . in particular the lxe pmt",
    "were constantly calibrated with leds and @xmath21-sources .",
    "the energy scale and resolution was evaluated with differences processes in a range from few mev to hundred mev using ( p,@xmath14 ) reaction excited with a dedicated proton cockroft - walton accelerator and a @xmath22 charge exchange and radiative capture reaction ( cex ) .",
    "the relative time between the lxe and tc was monitored using ( p,2@xmath14 ) events . the light yield and the energy scale",
    "was found to be stable well below 1% level . in fig.[fig : cexreso ] the energy spectrum for @xmath23 mev photons from cex process is shown , demonstrating that a resolution @xmath24 = 2.1 % has been achieved .",

    "measurements of radial positions of a positron track have resolution of 250 @xmath26 m while @xmath27 resolution can be described by a double gaussian function with @xmath28 = 600 @xmath26 m for 70% of the tracks .",
    "tc positron time resolution averaged over the various bars is about 70 @xmath29 .",
    "events falling into a pre - defined window ( blinding - box ) , containing the signal region on the @xmath14-ray energy and the time difference between the @xmath14-ray and the positron , are written to a separate data - stream , in order to prevent any bias in the analysis procedure .",

    "a candidate @xmath5 event is characterized by the measurement of five kinematic parameters : positron energy ( @xmath30 ) , photon energy ( @xmath31 ) , relative time between the positron and photon ( @xmath32 ) and opening angles between the two particles ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "after the opening of the blinding - box the number of @xmath0 events is determined by means of a maximum likelihood fit in the analysis region defined as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
