    "observations in j and ks bands have been carried out at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) with the new infrared imager / spectrometer sofi ( moorwood et al .",
    "it is equipped with a 1024@xmath41024 pixel rockwell hawaii array ( 0.292 arcsec / pix ) .",
    "the observed field , centered at @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( j2000 ) include the ntt deep field ( arnouts et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the observations have been performed with seeing conditions ranging from 0.6 - 0.9 arcsec ( median fwhm = 0.75 arcsec ) .",
    "a total exposure time of 624 min in ks and 256 min in j was achieved as a result of the jittered frame co - addition .",
    "raw data have been corrected for dark - current pattern by subtracting for each night a median dark and for pixel - to - pixel gain variations using a differential dome flat field .",
    "after flat fielding and standard sky subtraction , each basic set of frames has been registered and finally co - added to produce the final image the whole procedure has been accomplished relying on the original _",
    "package by devillard ( 1998 ; http://www.eso.org/eclipse ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the limiting surface brightness as well as the 3@xmath7 magnitude within a 2@xmath4 fwhm ( 1.5 arcsec ) circular aperture estimated on the final images are reported in tab . 1 .",
    "the extraction and the magnitude estimate of sources have been performed with the sextractor image analysis package ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) .",
    "the object detection has been performed in the central deepest portion ( 4.45@xmath44.45 arcmin ) of the images by first convolving them with a gaussian function having a fwhm=2.5 pixels ( @xmath8 arcsec ) . a 1@xmath9 detection threshold and a minimum detection area equal to the seeing disk",
    "have been used .",
    "this rather low detection threshold provides a raw catalog from which we have extracted different samples by varying the s / n limit in order to optimize completeness and number of spurious detections for a given magnitude limit .",
    "for example , at a @xmath10 detection limit , compact objects as faint as @xmath11 and @xmath12 were singled out in our images , compared with @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the deepest keck observations ( bershady et al .",
    "1998 ; djorgovski et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we are therefore confident that our sample is not biased against the detection of small compact sources , being fully comparable with the deepest data previously obtained by other authors on smaller areas on the sky ( gardner et al . 1993 ; cowie et al .",
    "1994 ; soifer et al . 1994",
    "; mcleod et al . 1995 ; djorgovski et al . 1995 ; moustakas et al . 1997 ; minezaki et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we have measured the reliability of the detections by evaluating the number of spurious sources and their magnitude distribution using a small set of noise images obtained by combining the corresponding set of frames with `` wrong '' shifts .",
    "the images thus obtained do not contain sources and are characterized by the same mean background noise of the original data .",
    "we have deduced that a s / n@xmath155 cutoff seems to ensure the optimum threshold for confident object detection both in j and ks within a 0.3 mag accuracy . on the basis of the above selection criterium our subsequent analysis",
    "will rely on the _ bona fide _ ks and j samples containing 1025 sources down to ks@xmath16 and 1569 sources down to j@xmath1724.0 , respectively .",
    "magnitudes have been estimated within a diameter aperture of 2.5 arcsec ( @xmath18fwhm ) and corrected to `` total '' using an aperture correction of 0.25 mag obtained using a sample of bright objects .",
    "in order to derive differential galaxy counts , we have first `` cleaned '' the two samples of stars .",
    "we have defined as stars those sources brighter than ks@xmath19 ( in the ks - band selected sample ) and j@xmath20 ( in the j - band selected sample ) , having a value of sextractor `` stellarity '' index larger than 0.9 both in the j sample and in the ks one .",
    "then we have evaluated the completeness correction to apply to the raw data to account for the number of sources undetected at a given magnitude .",
    "this correction is obviously stronger at faint magnitudes and it mainly depends on the source spatial structure .",
    "thus , we have generated a set of frames by dimming the final j and ks frames themselves by various factors while keeping constant the background noise .",
    "this way we have used the whole real sample of sources reproducing the whole range of size and shape .",
    "sextractor was then run with the same detection parameters to search for sources in each dimmed frame .",
    "1 shows the ks - band galaxy counts here derived superimposed to those in the literature .",
    "our counts follow a d@xmath21 relation with a slope of 0.38 in the magnitude range @xmath22 and do not show any evidence of a turnover or of a flattening down to the limits of the survey .    in fig .",
    "2 our j - band galaxy counts are compared with those of bershady et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the only j - band data available in the literature .",
    "we obtain a slope of j - band counts @xmath230.36 in the magnitude interval @xmath24 .",
    "also the j - band counts do not show any hint of a decrease down to the limits of the data .",
    "the total numbers of galaxies represented in fig.1 and 2 are 874 for the ks - band and 1285 for the j - band and represent the largest samples at these depths .",
    "the 2.5 arcsec aperture j - k color of galaxies in our sample was obtained by running sextractor in the so - called _ double - image mode _ : j magnitudes for the ks selected sample have been derived using the ks frame as reference image for detection and the j image for measurements only , _",
    "vice versa _ for the j selected sample .    in fig . 3 and 4 the j - ks color of each galaxy",
    "is shown as a function of the apparent magnitude for the two samples .",
    "the median j - ks color in each magnitude bin is also over - plotted as filled circles .",
    "the error bars are the standard deviation from the mean of the values within each bin .",
    "both the samples show first a reddening trend of the median j - ks color down to ks@xmath2 and j@xmath3 respectively .",
    "fainter than these magnitudes the j - k color of galaxies follows an unexpected behavior describing a bluing trend with increasing apparent magnitudes .    in order to measure the size of galaxies of our samples ,",
    "we have made use of the metric size function @xmath25 introduced first by petrosian ( 1976 ) @xmath26    ( kron 1993 ) , where @xmath27 is the growth curve .",
    "this function has the property @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the surface brightness at radius @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the mean surface brightness within @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath25 has been obtained for each galaxy by constructing its own intensity profile .",
    "following bershady et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we have defined the angular size of galaxies the value @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "the median @xmath34 values are 0.73 arcsec and 0.79 arcsec for the j - band and ks - band selected sample respectively .",
    "we have then measured the compactness of galaxies by defining the luminosity concentration index @xmath35 @xmath36 that is the ratio between the flux within the radius @xmath34 and the flux interior to the radius @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "5 the concentration index @xmath35 and the apparent radius @xmath34 of galaxies belonging to the ks sample are shown as a function of the apparent magnitude ks in the upper and lower panel respectively .",
    "the light concentration index seems to remain constant down to ks@xmath2 and j@xmath3 while it is evident that galaxies become systematically more compact to fainter magnitudes .",
    "this trend is clearly present in both the samples as shown by the decrease of the median values @xmath35 with increasing apparent magnitudes .",
    "it is worth noting that the increasing compactness of galaxies occurs in the same magnitude ranges where galaxies get bluer .",
    "moreover this trend seems to be matched also by a decrease of the apparent size of galaxies .",
    "the main results obtained by this preliminary analysis of the data are the following :    * number counts follow a @xmath38 relation with a slope of 0.38 in ks and of 0.36 in j showing no sign of flattening or turnover down to the faintest magnitudes . such slopes and behavior fully agree with most of the ground - based data and with the deepest nicmos / hst data ( yan et al .",
    "1998 ) ; * fainter than ks@xmath2 and j@xmath3 , the median j - k color of galaxies shows a break in its reddening trend turning toward bluer colors ; * faint bluer galaxies also display a larger compactness index , and a smaller apparent size .",
    "the absence of a turnover in the counts down to the faintest magnitudes is indicative of an increasing contribution of sub - l@xmath39 and hence local ( @xmath40 ) galaxies leading to a substantial steepening in the faint - end tail of the galaxy ir lf .",
    "such a claim is also supported by the observed color trend which seems to rule out any major contribution of high-@xmath41 galaxies as primary contributors to faint counts .",
