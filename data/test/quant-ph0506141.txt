    "this paper is based on a talk given at a conference in naples @xcite .",
    "it is well known that if backward time travel could be implemented , or if the present could shape the past by some other means , then closed causal chains , or causal loops , could be formed .",
    "the possibility of causal loops must arise because changing , or rewriting , the past is not particularly meaningful .",
    "if these loops are not self consistent , paradoxes arise @xcite .",
    "the best known of these is the grandfather paradox : a man travels into the past to kill his grandfather before his grandfather meets his grandmother .",
    "if he succeeds then we have the paradox that the man is never born , thus the grandfather is not killed , thus the man is born and so on .",
    "a simpler and more direct example is autoinfanticide , whereby a man travels into the past and shoots himself as a baby .",
    "a different example is where a man travels back and introduces his parents to each other @xcite .",
    "here we have a paradox if he fails in his task .",
    "a more direct version of this latter type of paradox involves a robot , let us say , which enters a time machine in the present .",
    "when it emerges from the machine in the past it is sent through a rejuvenator which removes its memory and programs it to walk around until it enters the time machine in the present .",
    "a paradox occurs if something prevents the robot from entering the time machine in the present .",
    "sometimes the possibility of such paradoxes is taken as an argument against the possibility of backward time travel .",
    "it can , however , be argued that , because of continuity in nature , self - consistent loops or cycles in these situations always exist and it is only these cycles that nature allows @xcite .",
    "somehow the physics sorts things out so that the probability of inconsistent cycles is zero",
    ". we shall refer to this argument as the principle of self consistency @xcite .",
    "an example of a self - consistent solution to the autoinfanticide cycle is the scenario in which the man raises his rifle to shoot himself as a baby but , because of his bad shoulder , misses the baby s heart and hits it in the shoulder @xcite .",
    "if we accept that self - consistent loops are reasonable , the question arises as to the mechanism by which physics disallows inconsistent loops and ensures self consistency . in this paper",
    "we show that quantum mechanics may provide an answer to this question .",
    "quantum mechanics is essentially concerned with the preparation of a system and its subsequent measurement .",
    "the measurement device can be described mathematically by a probability operator measure ( pom ) @xcite .",
    "each element @xmath0 of the pom corresponds to a possible outcome event _ j _ of the measurement .",
    "all the pom elements are non - negative definite , that is , their expectation values for any state of the system are greater than or equal to zero .",
    "the pom elements sum to the unit operator , ensuring that the probability that there is some outcome of the measurement is unity .",
    "the pom elements themselves indicate the states the system can be `` found in '' . the preparation device can be described mathematically by a collection of preparation device operators ( pdo ) @xmath1 associated with possible preparation outcomes @xcite .",
    "these non - negative definite operators indicate the possible states the system can be `` prepared in '' .",
    "the _ a priori _",
    "probability @xmath2 for a preparation event _ i _ is given by the trace tr@xmath1 .",
    "the trace of the sum of all the @xmath1 is unity , ensuring that the probability that there is some outcome of the preparation is unity .",
    "an essential feature of quantum mechanics , as opposed to classical mechanics , is that , even if there is no evolution of the system between the preparation and measurement events , the state the system is found in is not necessarily the state the system is prepared in .",
    "the usual formalism of quantum mechanics is predictive . between preparation and measurement",
    "we assign to the system a state on the basis of our knowledge of the preparation event . if we have no knowledge of the outcome of the preparation , the best we can do is to assign a density operator immediately after preparation equal to the sum of the pdo s .",
    "if , however , we know the outcome was the preparation event _ i _ , we assign the normalized density operator @xmath3 @xmath4tr@xmath1 immediately after preparation .",
    "this state evolves unitarily forward in time to become @xmath5 at the time of measurement .",

    "i , _ is given by @xmath7 .",
    "\\label{e1}\\ ] ]    as the name indicates , the predictive formalism is particularly useful for predicting outcomes of measurement events based on knowledge of preparation events .",
    "we can use the formalism , in conjunction with bayes theorem , to retrodict outcomes of preparation events given measurement events@xcite . from bayes theorem we have @xmath8    when the known outcome _",
    "i _ of the preparation device corresponds to a pure state @xmath9 , both @xmath1 and @xmath4tr@xmath1 are just @xmath10 .",
    "also when the known outcome _ j _ of the measurement device corresponds to a pure state @xmath11 both @xmath0 and @xmath12tr@xmath0 are just @xmath13 .",
    "it is simpler in such cases to work with the associated pure states instead of the pdo s and pom elements .",
    "expression ( [ e1 ] ) then becomes simply @xmath14 .",
    "an interesting situation arises when we have prepared two systems _ a _ and _ b _ in an entangled pure state , which evolves to , say , @xmath15 at the time of the measurement of system _ b _ , which is measured before system _ a_. if the measurement outcome is the pom element corresponding to state @xmath16 , then , in the predictive formalism , the measurement projects this state onto the entangled state , giving the state @xmath17 after normalization .",
    "this collapsed state continues to evolve forwards in time until system _ a _ is measured .      a less usual , but equally valid , quantum mechanical formalism is the retrodictive formalism @xcite . here",
    "the state of a system between preparation and measurement is assigned on the basis of our knowledge of the _ measurement _ event .",

    "it is not difficult to show , using the cyclic property of the trace , that this is the same as the formula for @xmath21 in ( [ e2 ] ) obtained from the predictive formalism plus bayes theorem .",
    "use of the retrodictive formalism for this purpose is more direct , however , which is why it is becoming useful for solving the basic quantum communication problem @xcite , in which bob measures the state of a quantum system sent by alice and has to retrodict the state she selected to send .",
    "our interest now , however , is the application of the retrodictive formalism to entangled systems .",
    "suppose the result of a measurement on two systems _ a _ and _ b _ corresponds to the pom element associated with the pure _ retrodictive _ entangled state which evolves backwards in time to    @xmath15 at the time of the preparation of system _ b _ , which is prepared after system _ a _ is prepared .",
    "if the preparation outcome is the pdo corresponding to state @xmath22 , then we project this state onto the entangled state , renormalize , and obtain the state @xmath23 this collapsed retrodictive state continues to evolve backwards in time until the time of the preparation of system _",
    "an even more interesting case arises when a retrodictive state from a measurement of system _ c _ at time @xmath24 evolves backwards to a state @xmath25 at the time @xmath26 of a preparation outcome that corresponds to the entangled state    @xmath27 the projection of @xmath28 onto this state collapses it to @xmath29 , which can be associated with a predictive state evolving forwards in time from @xmath26 .",
    "a method of making predictive entangled states is to prepare the light in the input modes _ b _ and _ c _ of a beam splitter in the vacuum and one - photon states with preparation devices p0 and p1 respectively .",
    "we can then write the predictive input state as @xmath30 . to be specific ,",
    "let the beam splitter , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , be symmetric and reflect as much light as it transmits .",
    "the action of the beam splitter can be represented by a unitary operator @xmath31 .",
    "it is possible to show that for this 50/50 beam splitter , the action of the beam splitter on the input state is to transform it to the entangled state @xcite @xmath32 in the output of the beam splitter .",
    "this shows that there is an equal chance for the photon to remain in mode _ c _ , that is to be transmitted , and for it to be reflected into mode _",
    "b_. it is sometimes convenient to regard p0 , p1 and the beam splitter as a combined preparation device that generates the predictive state @xmath33 if the outcomes of p0 and p1 correspond to zero and one photons .",
    "this entangled state then propagates forward in time .",
    "if , at a later time @xmath24 , a measurement on the field in mode _ c _ shows that the photon is in mode _ c _ then , according to the usual description of the measurement process in the predictive formalism , the field instantaneously collapses at @xmath24 to @xmath34 after normalization .",
    "that is , the field in mode _ b _ changes suddenly to the vacuum simultaneously with the measurement of the field in mode _",
    "c , _ even though this measurement event can take place an appreciable distance away .",
    "this , of course , is just an illustration of the well - known einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox involving instantaneous collapse over a large distance .",

    "photon detectors d1 and d0 are in the output ports _ b _ and _ a _ of a 50/50 beam splitter as shown in fig .",
    "if d1 detects one photon and d0 detects zero photons , the output field of the beam splitter is in the retrodictive state @xmath39 .",
    "this state propagates backwards in time through the beam splitter .",
    "the unitary operator for this evolution is @xmath40 .",
    "we can show that @xmath41 which can be interpreted that the photon has an equal chance of being reflected in its journey back in time into mode _ a _ or of staying in mode _",
    "b_. it is sometimes convenient to regard d1 , d0 and the beam splitter as a combined measurement device that generates the retrodictive state @xmath42 corresponding to the combined event of d1 detecting one photon and d0 detecting zero photons .",
    "if there is a preparation device with a known output state acting on input mode _ a _ , then we can project this state onto the retrodictive entangled state , resulting in a retrodictive state in input mode _",
    "b_. this retrodictive state continues to evolve backwards in time .",
    "let us examine , in terms of the retrodictive formalism , the case where a combined preparation device generates the predictive state @xmath43 at time @xmath44 for example as described above , and where a later measurement on the field in mode _ c _ at time @xmath24 _  _ shows the presence of one photon in this mode .",
    "we attach a retrodictive state @xmath45 to the field at the time of measurement .",
    "this state evolves backwards in time and becomes @xmath46 at the output of the combined preparation device , that is at the output port of the beam splitter , at time @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the hermitian conjugate of the free - space forward time evolution operator from @xmath26 to @xmath48 the effect of @xmath49on @xmath50 is to leave this state unchanged , so at the preparation time @xmath51we project @xmath50 onto the state @xmath52 , leaving us after normalization with the predictive state @xmath35 which evolves forward in time .",
    "this is the same state that we obtained in the predictive description of the same situation but there is an important difference . in the retrodictive formalism",
    "the collapse to this state takes place at @xmath53 the time of preparation , that is _ as the field is leaving the beam splitter _ , whereas in the predictive formalism it occurs at @xmath54 the time of measurement , giving rise to the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox .",
    "we can combine the above beam splitter with preparation devices p0 and p1 in its input modes , which we shall refer to as bsl , and the above beam splitter with photon detectors d0 and d1 in its output modes , which we shall refer to as bsu , to form a double beam splitter arrangement that shares the common mode _",
    "b _ , as shown in fig",
    ". 2 @xcite .",
    "bsl and bsu are the lower and upper beam splitters in this figure .",
    "the output mode _ b _ of beam splitter bsl becomes the input mode _",
    "b _ of bsu . in the other input mode of bsu ,",
    "that is input mode _ a _ , we put a preparation device whose single possible outcome event corresponds to the known predictive state @xmath55 at the immediate entry to bsu .",
    "we assume also that we can adjust the preparation device to control the ratio of the coefficients @xmath56 .",
    "we also know that p0 and p1 prepare vacuum and one - photon states respectively .",
    "we can interpret the superposition state ( [ e7 ] ) as showing that one or zero photons might be in input mode _",
    "including the photon input from p1 , detectors d0 and d1 might detect a total of either one or two photons .",
    "there is a sizeable probability that d0 and d1 will detect zero and one photons respectively .",
    "we can calculate this probability , which depends on @xmath57 but we do not need the precise result here .",
    "other possible measurement outcomes are d0 and d1 detecting one and zero photons respectively , one and one photon respectively , zero and two photons respectively and two and zero photons respectively .",
    "is the same as the state @xmath58 .,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    let us study the case in which detectors d0 and d1 detect zero and one photons respectively . as seen in ( [ e6 ] ) , this detection event generates an entangled retrodictive state @xmath59 at the input to bsu .",
    "as we know there is a preparation event corresponding to a predictive state @xmath60 here , we project this state onto the entangled state and obtain the retrodictive state that , after normalization , is @xmath61 this is the state of the field at the time @xmath24 .",
    "this state propagates backwards in time in mode _ b _ to become @xmath62 at the output mode _ b _ port of the other beam splitter bsl at the earlier time @xmath26 .",
    "the action of the free space backward time evolution operator @xmath49 is just to change the phase of the state @xmath63 . to avoid unnecessary complications without losing the essential physics ,",
    "we now specify that the optical distance between the two beam splitters is an integer number of wavelengths of the light .",
    "this means that the retrodictive state at the earlier time @xmath26 at the output of bsl becomes again @xmath63 . at this time",
    "this state is projected onto the known output @xmath43 of the combined p0 , p1 and bsl preparation device to give @xmath64 after normalization and removal of the undetectable phase factor _",
    "i _ , we see that this predictive state in mode _ c _ , which we label @xmath65 , is identical to the predictive state @xmath66 in ( [ e7 ] ) which we inject into bsu _ at a later time .",
    "_    we see therefore that , by means of the double beam splitter device , we can send a state of light @xmath67 , for which we can choose the ratio @xmath56 , backwards in time from when we prepare it at time @xmath24 to an earlier time @xmath68 . in principle",
    "the beam splitters can be separated by , say , one light day so the state @xmath58 which we choose today can be sent back to appear yesterday .",
    "can we use this device to send a message to our earlier selves ?",
    "unfortunately , we can not .",
    "the state @xmath58 appears yesterday only if the detectors d0 and d1 detect zero and one photons respectively and we have no control over what they will detect .",
    "if they detect one and zero photons respectively , which is just as likely , then the state @xmath69 that appears yesterday is @xmath70 .",
    "if they both detect zero photons then @xmath71",
    ". if they detect a total of two photons then @xmath72 .",
    "thus in the absence of preknowledge of what will be detected the best we can do is to send a mixed state back .",
    "this mixed state is the sum of the density matrices representing the four possible states @xmath69 weighted by the probabilities of them occurring .",
    "a formal calculation of this mixed state and of the quantum information it can carry shows that zero information can be transmitted to the past .",
    "this may seem a little surprising because , if we could measure the state @xmath73 sometimes we might find @xmath74 or @xmath75 , which we could ignore , but on a sizeable number of occasions we would find @xmath76 or @xmath70 from which we could calculate the ratio @xmath57 which could be the number of the winner of a horse race .",
    "unfortunately , to determine the state @xmath69 with any reasonable precision , we need a large of identical copies of it .",
    "this can not be done by cloning and , as we have noted above , our lack of control over the outcomes of d0 and d1 prevents us from sending identical copies back .",
    "what use is an uncontrollable time machine if the lack of control is such as to prevent us sending any information back in time ? even though we can not control it we do , however , send something back .",
    "further , we do _ know _ what we have sent back . thus it might be possible to use such a device to examine a causal loop associated with a time travel paradox .",
    "specifically , let us consider the robot cycle described in the introduction .",
    "the robot enters a time machine today in a particular state @xmath77 and is sent back in time to yesterday . upon emerging from the time machine yesterday",
    "it enters a rejuvenator which adjusts its state and programs it to walk around for a day and then to enter the time machine in precisely the state @xmath77 .",
    "although the robot exists only during the cycle , the cycle is not isolated from the rest of the world . as well as there being a need to build and adjust the time machine and rejuvenator , the robot itself will leave footprints as it enters the time machine .",
    "these footprints will provide evidence of the existence of the robot as well as providing information about its properties , for example its size .",
    "the action of the rejuvenator on the robot may depend on properties of the robot itself . if the rejuvenator fails to program the robot to be in the state @xmath77 today , either because of bad adjustment or because of some property of the robot",
    ", then we have an inconsistency .",
    "according to the principle of self consistency only self - consistent loops are possible , so in this case there would be no footprints associated with this particular type of robot entering the time machine . the adjustment of the rejuvenator might , however , be suitable to provide a self - consistent cycle for a different robot , say a small robot . in this case , the need for consistency would not eliminate this cycle and any footprints left would be small .     from the lower beam splitter is directed through a phase shifter ps and via a fully reflecting mirror to become the input light in state @xmath78 at the input of the upper beam splitter.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our aim is to use the double beam splitter device to examine closed cycles .",
    "classically if the rejuvenator programs the robot to be in a state today even slightly different from @xmath77 , an inconsistency arises because we regard different classical states as effectively orthogonal .",
    "this is justifiable to the extent that , in quantum mechanical terms , even if one particle of the robot is in an orthogonal state to what it should be then the complete state of the robot is orthogonal to what it should be . for simpler quantum mechanical systems , however , the distinction is not as clear cut .",
    "here we have the possibility of complete self - consistency if the two states under consideration are identical and of complete inconsistency if these states are orthogonal . in between",
    "we have states that are not identical but not orthogonal .",
    "we shall see the effect of this later . to create a consistent cycle we wish to allow the field in state @xmath69 at @xmath26 to evolve forward in time until , at @xmath24 , it is in the state @xmath79 entering the input port of bsu in mode @xmath38 .",
    "to do this we create a feedback loop with fully reflecting mirrors while keeping the two path lengths between bsl and bsu equal , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . again , for simplicity , we assume both these path lengths are an integer number of wavelengths . in order to experiment with consistent and inconsistent cycles we also insert a phase shifter into the feedback part of the cycle .",
    "this acts as our adjustable rejuvenator . introducing the other part of the loop in fig .",
    "3 removes the controllable preparation device which prepares @xmath79 in fig .",
    "2 so we no longer have the control we had to choose the ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the only preparation devices are now p0 and p1 . from conservation of energy , this means that a total of only one photon can be detected by d0 and d1 .",
    "also , from symmetry , the photon should have an equal probability of being found in mode _ b _ and in the mode containing the phase shifter if we were to try to detect photons in these modes .",
    "that is , there should be a probability of 1/2 of finding the photon in either mode .",
    "we can ensure this by letting @xmath80 .",
    "the effect of applying a phase shift @xmath81 to the field in state @xmath82 is to change it from @xmath83 to @xmath84 so @xmath69 will evolve to the state @xmath85 at time @xmath48 thus by adjusting the value of @xmath81 to zero or an integer multiple of @xmath86 , we can make the rejuvenator work perfectly and obtain the consistency requirement @xmath87 @xmath88 . for a general value of @xmath81",
    ", we obtain the projection @xmath89/2 .",
    "\\label{e11}\\ ] ] by setting @xmath90 we see that ( [ e11 ] ) vanishes , so @xmath91 is _ orthogonal _ to @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we can say that the rejuvenated state is definitely not the state required for a self - consistent cycle .",
    "the principle of self consistency would then imply that this closed cycle is impossible .",
    "the outcome or `` footprints '' associated with this particular cycle , that is , d0 and d1 measuring zero and one photons respectively , should thus never be observed .",
    "let us now keep @xmath90 and examine the cycle we would obtain associated with the other outcome that d0 and d1 measure one and zero photons respectively .",
    "this is the only other possible outcome for the closed cycle because , as noted above , a total of only one photon can be registered by d0 and d1 .",
    "we then find , in place of ( [ e6 ] ) that    @xmath92    we find that projecting @xmath58 onto ( [ e12 ] ) gives us the retrodictive state @xmath93 at @xmath48 this state evolves backwards in time to @xmath94 at @xmath26 because the mode _ b _ path is an integer number of wavelengths .",
    "projecting this onto the prepared entangled state @xmath43 gives , after normalization and removal of the undetectable factor , the state @xmath95 this leads to @xmath96 we see that for this case we do have a self - consistent cycle , with associated `` footprints '' being d0 and d1 measuring one and zero photons respectively .",
    "thus there is no reason on the basis of the principle of self consistency to eliminate this cycle . on the other hand",
    "if we set @xmath97 we find for this case that @xmath98 so we have an inconsistent cycle so there should be no chance of d0 and d1 measuring one and zero photons respectively for this setting of @xmath81 .",
    "we have seen that if we use the only output measure we have , that is what d0 and d1 detect , as a `` probability meter '' for a cycle occurring , then the principle of self consistency implies that we can adjust the setting of @xmath99 to make one or other of the two possible measurement outcomes impossible . while this is really all we can talk about classically , in quantum mechanics we also have intermediate cases .",
    "for example , what happens if we choose @xmath100 ?",
    "in this case there would be some incomplete overlap of @xmath58 and @xmath101 we might expect that we could extend the principle of self consistency such that the probability for the cycle occurring is@xmath102 .",
    "thus on repeating the experiment a large number of times , in some of cases the footprints for one cycle would be found , for example d0 and d1 measuring one and zero photons respectively , and for the remaining cases the alternative footprints would be found .",
    "the next question is whether or not we should build the uncontrollable time machine with the feedback loop to investigate experimentally the principle of self consistency , that is , to check if we do indeed find it impossible for d0 and d1 to detect zero and one photons respectively if @xmath90 .",
    "fortunately there is no need actually to do the experiment because what we have shown in fig .",
    "3 is essentially a mach - zehnder interferometer for which we know the results .",
    "as shown below , these confirm that d0 and d1 do not detect zero and one photons respectively if @xmath90 and do not detect one and zero photons respectively if @xmath97 .",
    "even more fortunately , we can explain how the mach - zehnder interferometer works in terms of interference of quantum mechanical amplitudes in the usual predictive formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "essentially there are two paths by which a photon from p1 in fig .",
    "3 can be detected by d1 , that is , via the mode _ b _ path and via the phase shifter path .",
    "these two paths are the two components of the cycle .",
    "we might think of the photon being reflected by bsl and then transmitted by bsu or as being transmitted by bsl and reflected by bsu .",
    "the amplitude for reflection @xmath103 by bsl into mode _ b _ is the coefficient of @xmath104 in ( [ e5 ] ) , that is @xmath105 likewise the transmission amplitude for bsu is the coefficient of @xmath106 on ( [ e5 ] ) , that is , @xmath107 thus the compound amplitude for reaching d1 via mode _ b _ is @xmath108 .",
    "the transmission amplitude for bsl is also @xmath109 and phase shifter introduces another factor @xmath110 so the amplitude of being transmitted and reaching bsu is @xmath111 .",
    "the reflection amplitude for bsu is also @xmath112 the compound amplitude for reaching d1 via the mode containing the phase shifter is @xmath113 .",
    "the _ total _",
    "amplitude for detection of the photon by d1 is then @xmath114/2 .",
    "\\label{e15}\\ ] ]    if @xmath90 the amplitude for one path is the negative of the amplitude for the other path and the total amplitude , and therefore the probability for d1 to detect a photon , is zero . if @xmath115 however , the amplitudes for these two paths add constructively , giving a unit probability for detection .",
    "we note that the probability obtained by squaring the modulus of ( [ e15 ] ) is equal to@xmath116 these results confirm the principle of self consistency for this particular case _ and _ its extension that the probability for footprints associated with the cycle occurring is@xmath117 .",
    "these results indicate that we should look to quantum mechanical _ amplitudes _ , rather than probabilities , in seeking the physical mechanism underlying the impossibility of inconsistent cycles , that is , in understanding how physics sorts things out and arrives at a consistent cycle . for a causal closed cycle",
    ", we can choose the earliest event and the latest event , which is associated with the footprints for example , and then regard the two parts of the cycle as two different ways of reaching the latest event , or footprints , from the earliest event .",
    "indeed , we could also regard the cycle as two different ways of reaching the earliest event from the latest event .",
    "if the amplitudes associated with the two parts completely interfere then the total amplitude associated with the cycle is zero and the probability for the cycle occurring is zero , that is , it is impossible .",
    "constructive interference , however , renders the cycle possible . for simple quantum systems , there are intermediate cases between completely destructive and completely constructive interference , so the probability for some cycles will be somewhere between zero and unity .",
    "there only needs to be a slight difference in two states of a macroscopic object , for example if the two states are identical except for the states of just one particle of the object which are orthogonal , to make the macroscopic states orthogonal themselves .",
    "consequently we usually consider classical cycles as being either consistent or inconsistent .",
    "the possibility of inconsistent closed causal cycles has been used as an argument against the possibility of backward time travel@xmath118 against this , the principle of self consistency has been proposed which states that physics sorts things out so that inconsistent cycles are impossible anyway , so any closed cycles must be consistent .",
    "if this principle is correct then the possibility of closed cycles is not a valid argument against backward time travel .",
    "this principle , however , opens up another question - how does physics sort out things so that only consistent cycles occur ? in this paper we have examined this question in the light of a device which can be interpreted , in terms of the retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics , as an uncontrollable time machine .",
    "a known state of light @xmath79 at the input of a beam splitter at time @xmath24 is sent into the past and then allowed to evolve into the future so that at time @xmath24 it is in state @xmath78 at the input of the beam splitter . because the device is interpretable in usual predictive quantum theory as an interferometer , we can calculate the probability of the cycle occurring and leaving its particular footprints to be @xmath119 .",
    "this means that the probability of the cycle occurring , as observed by its footprints , is unity if @xmath91 is the same state as @xmath58 and is zero if @xmath78 is orthogonal to @xmath79 .",
    "the former case is a self consistent cycle and the latter is an inconsistent cycle .",
    "these results _ confirm _ the principle of self consistency for this particular case .",
    "furthermore , the results allow a possible extension of the principle , which is essentially classical , to quantum mechanics to say that the probability of a cycle occurring can be found by calculating the quantum evolution of the state around the cycle , which involves evolution both backwards and forwards in time , to find the evolved state at the starting point .",
    "the probability of the cycle is then given by the square of the modulus of the projection of the evolved state onto the original state .",
    "if what we have found for the cycle we have studied can be applied to all cycles , then we have an underlying quantum mechanical explanation of the principle of self consistency . essentially ,",
    "if we work in terms of quantum mechanical amplitudes rather than probabilities , we can select the latest and earliest events on the cycle and then say that the amplitude for reaching the latest event from the earliest event has two terms , corresponding to the two different pathways to the later event . for inconsistent cycles these two amplitudes cancel each other when added .",
    "for consistent cycles , they interfere constructively .",
    "the probability of the cycle is the square of the modulus of the total amplitude and thus fully inconsistent cycles have a probability of zero of occurring , that is , they are impossible .",
    "even slightly different classical states , that is quantum states of macroscopic objects , can be orthogonal so these slight differences induced by evolution around the cycle can render the cycle impossible .",
    "classical cycles are thus usually regarded as consistent or inconsistent .",
    "it is not totally surprising that a principle applying to classical physics has a quantum mechanical basis .",
    "the classical principle of least action can be explained in terms of the addition of amplitudes associated with all possible paths .",
    "the amplitudes for all paths except for those in the region of the path of least action cancel , so the probability for finding that the system has taken a path not near the path of least action is zero @xcite .",
    "this explains how the system `` knows '' to take the path of least action . in this paper",
    "we suggest that closed causal cycles are sorted out by a similar mechanism .",
    "only those cycles with a net non - zero amplitude have a non - zero probability of occurring and these are the consistent cycles . in conclusion , rather than just being invoked to save the possibility of the present shaping the past , it now seems that the principle of self consistency could well have a solid physical basis in quantum mechanics .",
