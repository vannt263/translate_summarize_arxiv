    "it has been known that a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of kaon photoproduction is still far away from what we expected one or two decades ago , in spite of the fact that there are ample experimental data with good quality recently provided by modern accelerators such as jlab in newport news , elsa in bonn , and spring8 in osaka .",
    "the reason for this set back is because of the high threshold energy , which not only `` switches on '' the strangeness degree of freedom , but also increases the level of complexity of phenomenological or theoretical models that attempt to describe the process . already close to the production threshold ( @xmath7 mev for @xmath8 photoproduction ) ,",
    "a number of established nucleon resonances contribute to the process , for instance the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . even below the threshold",
    "there are the well known roper resonance @xmath12 along with two other four - star resonances @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the presence of strangeness degree of freedom insists on the use of su(3 ) symmetry in the reaction mechanism , rather than su(2 ) as in the case of pion production , which clearly makes the theoretical formalism more difficult .    in the last decades",
    "tremendous efforts have been devoted to model kaon photoproduction process .",
    "most of them have been performed in the framework of tree - level isobar models @xcite , coupled channel approaches @xcite , regge model @xcite , or quark models @xcite . extending the energy range of isobar models to higher region by utilizing regge formalism",
    "has also been pursued recently @xcite . at present ,",
    "experimental data are abundant from threshold up to 2.5 gev . in this energy range",
    "there are 19 nucleon resonances in the particle data book @xcite table ( pdg ) , which may propagate in the @xmath15-channel intermediate states .",
    "in addition , there are hyperon and meson resonances that may also influence the background terms of the process .",
    "to take into account all these excited states is naturally a daunting task , since their hadronic and electromagnetic coupling constants are mostly unknown .",
    "there is a possibility to fit all these unknown parameters , however , the accuracies of presently available data still allow for too many possible solutions .",
    "furthermore , the extracted couplings are quite often `` nonphysical '' , in the sense that their values are much smaller or much larger than the widely known pion coupling constant @xmath16 . in the literature",
    ", a number of recipes have been put forward to avoid this problem , e.g. , by limiting the number of resonances , by taking into account as many as possible constraints that are relevant to the process , or by combining these two methods .    except limiting the energy of interest , there is no firm argument for limiting the number of resonances that should be put into the model . in the previous works , the goal to construct a very simple elementary operator for use in nuclear physics",
    "was sometimes used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the argument of duality is also proposed to this end @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the number of phenomenological models describing kaon photoproduction was quickly increasing in the last decades .",
    "these models differ chiefly by the number and type of resonances used as well as , quite obviously , the values of extracted coupling constants .",
    "the exact values of coupling constants are a long - standing problem . even for the main coupling constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 there is so far no consensus as to which values",
    "should be used in the electromagnetic production of kaon .",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry dictates the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , given that the su(3 ) is broken at the level of 20% @xcite .",
    "these values are consistent with those extracted from the @xmath21-@xmath22 or @xmath23-@xmath22 scattering data @xcite .",
    "however , the qcd sum rules predicted significantly smaller values , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the values extracted from kaon photoproduction are mostly much smaller than the su(3 ) prediction , unless hadronic form factors were used in hadronic vertices or some absorptive factors are applied to reduce the born terms @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that the problem of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 values is far from settled at present .",
    "other coupling constants , such as those of @xmath5 and @xmath6 intermediate states can be also estimated with the help of su(3 ) symmetry and a number of parameters extracted from other reactions .",
    "their values are by all means less accurate than the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a quick glance to the @xmath8 photoproduction data base will reveal that there are more than 100 data points of differential cross section for the energy range from threshold up to 50 mev above the threshold , available from the saphir @xcite and clas @xcite collaborations .",
    "this indicates that a phenomenological analysis of kaon photoproduction near the production threshold is already possible . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there was no such an analysis performed with these data .",
    "the latest study of kaon photoproduction from threshold up to 14 mev above the @xmath26 was performed by cheoun _",
    "@xcite more than a decade ago . since there were no data available at that time , cheoun _ et al .",
    "_ predicted the total cross section of the @xmath27 process by varying the value of @xmath28 from 0 to 4 and studied the difference between the pseudoscalar ( ps ) and pseudovector ( pv ) couplings in this reaction .",
    "they argued that measurement of the total cross section can determine the real value of this coupling constant .",
    "we note that for the su(3 ) value of the @xmath28 , the total cross sections for both ps and pv couplings at 10 mev above @xmath26 are predicted to be around 5 @xmath29b , whereas for the value accepted by the qcd sum rule the cross sections would be slightly more than 1 @xmath29b .",
    "it is interesting to compare these predictions with the currently available data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : total ] in section [ sec : result - photo ] ) and find that none of these predictions is right , since at this energy the experimental cross section is found to be less than 0.4 @xmath29b .",
    "from the facts presented above it is clear that investigation of kaon photoproduction near the production threshold is very important , because it could provide very important information on the simplest form of the reaction mechanism as well as information on the background terms . in the isobar model",
    "this also means information on the @xmath30- and @xmath31-channel intermediate states that contribute to the background terms .",
    "such information is obviously very difficult to obtain at high energies due to the complicated structure of reaction amplitude at this stage .",
    "furthermore , since models that describe the production at threshold are in general quite simple , the individual contributions of intermediate states to this process can be easily studied . in summary ,",
    "the result of this investigation should become a stepping stone for the construction of extended models describing the photo- and electroproduction reaction at higher energies .",
    "in this paper we present our analysis on the @xmath27 process near the production threshold , i.e. up to 50 mev above the @xmath32 , as well its extension to the electroproduction case @xmath33 .",
    "we note that a new version of kaon photoproduction data from clas collaboration has been published recently @xcite . however , since the behavior of these data at the threshold region is similar to that shown by the previous ones @xcite , we believe that it is sufficient to use the previous version of clas data @xcite for the photoproduction process in the following discussion for the sake of simplicity . as a starting point",
    "we consider the resonances suggested by cheoun _",
    "@xcite ( see table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the possible resonance intermediate states in the energy range of interest . however , different from the work of cheoun _ et al .",
    "_ , to simplify the fitting process in this work we fix the values of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 to the su(3 ) symmetry prediction , as in the case of kaon - maid @xcite , though we do not use the hadronic form factors in all hadronic vertices . for the resonance formalism",
    ", we use the breit - wigner multipole form as suggested by drechsel _",
    "_ @xcite and tiator _ et al .",
    "the advantage of using this formalism as compared to the covariant one is that it provides a direct comparison of the extracted helicity photon couplings with the pdg values .",
    "moreover , the multipole formalism does not produce unnecessary additional background terms that will interfere with the pure ones , as in the case of the covariant calculation . to further reduce the number of free parameters in our model we also fix the resonance parameters to the pdg values .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ps ] we present the formalism of our model in the ps theory .",
    "section [ sec : resonance ] briefly discusses resonance formalism of our model . in section [ sec : pv ] we present the difference between ps and pv amplitudes .",
    "the numerical results and comparison between experimental data for kaon photoproduction and model calculations will be given in section [ sec : result - photo ] . in section [ sec : electroproduction ] we discuss the extension of our model to the case of electroproduction and the effect of the available kaon electroproduction data on the result of our previous fit . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our findings .",
    "let us consider photo- and electroproduction process that can be represented as a real and virtual photon production @xmath34 as discussed in the previous section , the background terms of this process are obtained from a series of tree - level feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] .",
    "they consist of the standard @xmath15- , @xmath31- , and @xmath30-channel born terms along with the @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath30-channel vector meson .",
    "the energy near threshold can be considered as low energy , therefore , we would expect that no hadronic form factors is required in all hadronic vertices of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] .",
    "this has an obvious advantage , i.e. , we can further limit the number of free parameters as well as uncertainties in our model . in ref .",

    "it is easy to understand that the effect of electroproduction data is more apparent in the `` higher '' energy region , since the data exist at @xmath120 gev , about 40 mev above the threshold . in this region",
    ", the cross section is suppressed due to the size of the electroproduction data , which are presumably much smaller than those expected by the photoproduction data .",
    "interestingly , at `` lower '' energies , the agreement with experimental data is improved after including the electroproduction data .    to further elucidate the role of electroproduction data on the suppression of cross sections at @xmath121 we display the angular distribution of the photoproduction differential cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : dif_thc ] .",
    "it is found that the suppression phenomenon occurs only at forward and backward angles ( see panels with @xmath122 gev and @xmath123 gev ) .",
    "this phenomenon obviously originates from the small values of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 coupling constants .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data from clas collaboration ( @xmath123 gev ) are unavailable at these kinematical regions .",
    "the saphir data at @xmath122 gev seem to be better in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding accuracy is still unable to firmly resolve the difference between the two calculations , although at the very forward and backward directions the data seem to favor the small values of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 coupling constants .",
    "future experimental measurement at mami is expected to settle this problem .",
    "it is also important to note that by comparing the calculated photon beam and recoil polarizations with experimental data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarc ] we can observe the deficiency of the ps1 model .",
    "this is understandable , since the data shown in this figure are measured at @xmath124 gev , an energy region where predictions of the ps1 model for photoproduction are no longer reliable , due to the strong influence of the electroproduction data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kltotc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the number of the polarization data in the fitting database can not compete with that of the cross section data . increasing the number and improving the accuracy of these data near the threshold or using the weighting factor in the fitting process",
    "could be expected to improve this situation .    a comparison between separated differential cross sections @xmath125 ,",
    "@xmath126 , and @xmath127 calculated from the ps , ps1 , and kaon - maid models with experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ambroz ] . in this case",

    "the same result is also shown in case of the polarized structure function @xmath128 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nasser ] .",
    "however , we notice that kaon - maid is unable to reproduce the available data in all cases and , in fact , it shows a backward peaking behavior for @xmath125 , in contrast to the result of experimental measurement .",
    "we suspect that this behavior originates from the large contributions of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 intermediate states ( see the fourth column of table  [ tab : numerical - result ] ) . in the ps or ps1 model",
    "their contributions are significantly suppressed by means of the exponential form factors or small values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 coupling constants , respectively .",
    "it is also important to note that both ps and pv model seem to choose the zero @xmath126 , a conclusion that has been also drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , we notice that this is in contrast to the prediction of kaon - maid .",
    "the @xmath119 evolution of the longitudinal cross section @xmath129 is of special interest , especially for estimating the possibility of extracting kaon form factor @xmath130 . in the latest measurement at jlab",

    "nevertheless , it was concluded that within the combined systematical and statistical uncertainties the longitudinal cross sections are believed to be zero @xcite .",
    "the result of our ps and ps1 models are compared with the prediction of kaon - maid and very limited experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl_st ] .",
    "the agreement of the ps and ps1 models with the photoproduction data for transverse cross section at @xmath121 is certainly not surprising .",
    "however , the discrepancies between experimental data and model calculations at @xmath134 gev@xmath135 still show the consistency of the presented models .",
    "it should be remembered that both ps and ps1 models were fitted to the same , but unseparated data @xmath125 . therefore , as shown in upper and lower panels with the same @xmath136 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl_st ] , the underpredicted @xmath131 will always be compensated by the overpredicted @xmath129 .",
    "this result clearly indicates that in order to avoid the `` nonphysical '' separated longitudinal cross section @xmath129 , a model - dependent extraction of @xmath129 and @xmath131 would be strongly recommended .",
    "obviously , this could be performed only if we had a reliable isobar model that can describe all available data .",
    "from the smallness of the longitudinal cross sections shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sl_st ] , it is obvious that the extraction of @xmath137 form factor is difficult near the production threshold .",
    "moreover , we have numerically found that the longitudinal cross sections shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sl_st ] are dominated by the @xmath9 contribution .",
    "this is understandable since these cross sections are calculated at @xmath120 gev , precisely at the pole position . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the `` physical '' ( positive ) longitudinal cross section data are only found at higher @xmath67 , i.e. 1.95 gev . from this fact ,",
    "the extraction of the kaon electromagnetic form factor is naturally recommended at higher energies . especially at @xmath67 above 2 gev , where the contribution of nucleon resonances becomes less significant than the background terms .",
    "furthermore , the extraction is best performed at small @xmath138 , i.e. , forward angles , where the contribution of @xmath30-channel is maximum .",
    "for completeness we would like also to mention that we have investigated also kaon electroproduction in the case of pv coupling and found no substantial difference from the result of ps coupling .",
    "we have investigated kaon photo- and electroproduction off a proton near the production threshold by means of an isobar model .",
    "the background amplitude is constructed from the appropriate feynman diagrams , whereas the resonance amplitude is calculated by using the multipole formalism .",
    "in contrast to the results of the previous works that utilize isobar model or chiral perturbation theory it is found that both ps and pv models in the present work can nicely describe the available photoproduction data up to @xmath0 mev above the threshold . since in this work the values of the main coupling constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are fixed to the su(3 ) symmetry prediction , the obtained @xmath118 in the pv model is larger than in the case of the ps model .",
    "this originates from the fact that for the same coupling constants , the background amplitudes of the pv model is larger than that of the ps model .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 coupling constants are found to be consistent with the previous works .",
    "the @xmath1 resonance @xmath2 is found to play an important role in improving the agreement of the model calculation with experimental data , especially in the case of photon and recoil polarizations .",
    "it is found that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 hadronic coupling constants extracted from photoproduction data lead to very large electroproduction differential cross sections , and therefore could not be used unless special form factors that strongly suppress their contributions were introduced or the hadronic coupling constants were refitted to both photo- and electroproduction databases , simultaneously . in the latter , the model reliability at lower energies is improved , whereas at higher energies the calculated photoproduction observables significantly deviate from experimental measurement due to the strong influence of electroproduction data . from the size of longitudinal cross sections @xmath129 predicted by both ps and ps1 models",
    "we may conclude that investigation of the kaon electromagnetic form factor , that strongly relies on @xmath129 , is difficult to perform near the threshold region . more accurate experimental data at this energy region would certainly help to clarify some uncertainties in the present work .",

    "<S> kaon photo- and electroproduction off a proton near the production threshold are investigated by utilizing an isobar model . </S>",
    "<S> the background amplitude of the model is constructed from feynman diagrams , whereas the resonance term is calculated by using the multipole formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that both pseudoscalar and pseudovector models can nicely describe the available photoproduction data up to @xmath0 mev above the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 resonance @xmath2 is found to play an important role in improving the model . in the case of double polarization </S>",
    "<S> observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 our result corroborates the finding of sandorfi _ et al . _ due to the large contributions of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 vector mesons , extending the model to the case of electroproduction is almost impossible unless either special form factors that strongly suppress their contributions are introduced or all hadronic coupling constants are refitted to both photo- and electroproduction databases , simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> it is also concluded that investigation of the kaon electromagnetic form factor is not recommended near the threshold region . </S>"
