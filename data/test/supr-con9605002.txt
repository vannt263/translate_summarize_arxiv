    "low noise measurements in the sub - millimeter range , _ e.g. _ , in radioastronomy , require a stable , low noise local oscillator for the receiver .",
    "the flux flow oscillator ( ffo ) , a device made with a long josephson junction , has been proposed as a good candidate for this application @xcite .",
    "some of the most important features of such a device are the following @xcite : the output power is relatively large ( @xmath3 ) , the oscillator can be easily tuned in a wide band ( @xmath4 ) by varying the bias and a magnetic field , and the emitted signal has a very narrow linewidth ( @xmath5 at @xmath6 @xcite , less than @xmath7 in the band @xmath8 @xcite ) .",
    "as the signal generated by a local oscillator has to be coupled to a mixer or to a transmission line , in the literature different couplings to a load have been realized and studied @xcite . in some works ,",
    "in particular , the ffo has been d.c . coupled to a small junction acting as a detector , or , possibly , as a mixer ; in this case , the real drawback is that the junctions can not be biased independently .",
    "capacitive coupling not only overcomes this drawback , but it also allows to increase the power transferred to the load , since it eliminates the d.c .",
    "loading of the oscillator . in this paper",
    "we investigate and compare these two coupling techniques for an ffo .",
    "we note in passing that ours is not the first work to propose the use of a d.c .",
    "block between oscillator and load device ",
    "_ , @xcite . however , in contrast with @xcite , which described a complete and detailed integrated subsystem , we focus specifically on the effects of the coupling element on system performance .",
    "the ffo consists of a long josephson junction biased by a d.c .",
    "current @xmath9 and driven by the effect of a magnetic field @xmath10 , perpendicular to the length @xmath11 of the junction and parallel to the barrier , into a dynamical state in which the unidirectional motion of flux quanta ( josephson current vortices , or _ fluxons _ ) takes place @xcite . with reference to the configuration sketched in fig .",
    "[ layout ] , the fluxons continuously penetrate from the left edge of the junction and propagate to the right ; this regime corresponds to the appearance of typical branches in the @xmath12 characteristic .",
    "an array of vortices travels in the junction with phase velocity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average voltage across the junction , @xmath10 is the external magnetic field applied in the @xmath15 direction , @xmath16 is the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in the junction and @xmath17 is the effective magnetic thickness of the barrier .",
    "the largest signal in the flux flow regime is obtained biasing the junction at the top of the flux flow branch in the @xmath12 characteristic ; the corresponding voltage is determined by the _ velocity matching condition _ :",
    "the velocity @xmath18 approaches the swihart velocity @xmath16 and , hence , @xmath19 .",
    "one should take into account that a possible self magnetic field and the focusing effect of the external magnetic field @xcite could make @xmath14 larger .",
    "we shall assume that in the stationary state the expression for the junction voltage is given by the fourier series @xcite    @xmath20    where the coefficients @xmath21 are complex amplitudes and the @xmath22 denotes summation from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , but without the term @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the fundamental angular frequency of the series . since the amplitude of the fundamental component of the series  ( [ series ] ) is dominant , the frequency of the ffo signal is    @xmath27    this is just the frequency expected from the josephson relations when a d.c .",
    "voltage @xmath14 is applied across a junction .",
    "an important parameter for an oscillator is the frequency range in which it can generate a signal useful for applications , or , in other terms , its effective bandwidth . since",
    ", under the velocity matching condition @xmath28 , the frequency of the ffo is proportional to the magnetic field , @xmath29 , the effective bandwidth of the ffo is bounded to the values of the magnetic field within which the flux flow dynamic state is stable .",
    "its lower limit is given by the minimum value of magnetic field needed to have penetration of fluxons into the junction , _",
    "i.e. _ , by the critical field @xmath30 .",
    "the upper limit can be estimated by supposing the maximum voltage in the flux flow regime to be of the order of the voltage gap ( or of the order of @xmath31 in the high-@xmath2 context ) , as the nonlinear internal dynamics is strongly attenuated above that value .",
    "the tuning of the ffo to the desired frequency is achieved by changing the magnetic field to move the flux flow branch and by setting the d.c .",
    "current to bias the junction near the top of the branch .",
    "in fig .  [ layout ] there is a schematic representation of a long josephson junction , the ffo , that produces a signal coupled to the load through a capacitance . for this investigation",
    "the load device is assumed to be purely resistive .",
    "this assumption is made with the hypothesis that such a load model is sufficiently accurate to give information on the practical advantages of the capacitive coupling in comparison with simple d.c .",
    "coupling ; for other loads , an appropriate model could be chosen and analyzed using the same approach .",
    "the mathematical model describing the flux - flow oscillator is the perturbed sine - gordon equation ( psge ) , which in normalized form is    @xmath32    with the boundary conditions",
    "@xmath33    @xmath34    here , @xmath35 is the phase difference between the junction electrodes , @xmath36 is the spatial coordinate normalized to the josephson penetration length @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the time normalized to the inverse of the josephson angular plasma frequency @xmath39 , the subscripts indicate partial differentiation , the term in @xmath40 represents shunt loss due to quasiparticle tunneling ( here assumed ohmic ) , the term in @xmath41 represents surface loss in the junction electrodes , @xmath42 is the distributed bias current @xmath43 normalized to the critical current density @xmath44 , @xmath11 is the normalized junction length , @xmath45 is the external magnetic field in the plane of junction and perpendicular to its long dimension in units normalized to @xmath46 . in the @xmath47 load network @xmath48",

    "we note in passing that fig .",
    "[ layout ] depicts schematically a sandwich - type tunnel junction structure .",
    "although the fabrication technology for high-@xmath2 tunnel junctions is not yet completely mature , significant progress in this direction is being made @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in what follows we have chosen model parameter values that are aimed in the direction of describing a lightly - hysteretic tunnel junction .    in fig .",
    "[ fft ] we report the fourier spectrum of the voltage at the right edge of the junction @xmath59 calculated over more than two hundred periods .",
    "the spectrum consists of a d.c .",
    "component , whose height is the average voltage @xmath14 , a fundamental line at the frequency @xmath60 , having amplitude @xmath61 , and a number of harmonics , up to the 7th ; the small background is due to the finite sampling , to the finite integration time and to numerical noise .",
    "we remark that the fundamental frequency turns out to be just equal to what one would calculate from the height of the d.c .",
    "component ( taking into account the normalization ) , in full agreement with eq .",
    "( [ frequency ] ) .",
    "moreover , one sees that the fundamental harmonic is dominant and the amplitude of the other harmonics decreases exponentially with increasing order , as can also be inferred qualitatively from the inset in the same figure .",
    "we did not calculate the voltage spectrum for every value of the load used in our simulations ; rather , we performed for most of them a simpler test to check that the series  ( [ series ] ) could be truncated to the second term .",
    "in fact , we calculated the rms amplitude of the fundamental harmonic @xmath62 from the signal @xmath59 using the formula for the fourier series coefficient and the rms value of the a.c .",
    "component of the signal @xmath63 ; the comparison shows that they are always equal within 1% , so that in practice all the power is in the fundamental harmonic . in other words , in the case of the @xmath47 load the flux flow signal @xmath64 maintains , with good approximation , a sinusoidal form for every value examined of @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the output power @xmath65 is assumed to be the power of the first harmonic of the signal transferred from the flux flow oscillator to the resistive load @xmath51 . for our @xmath47 loading network it is given by    @xmath66 } \\ , .",

    "we compared the output power for the @xmath47 load to that of d.c .",
    "coupling to a resistive load , which has been already studied by zhang @xcite , to emphasize the different behavior .",
    "we have , in our model , the pure-@xmath0 load case by setting @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ il ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) . for the sake of consistency",
    ", we used the same parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , biasing the junction with @xmath73 on a flux flow step obtained with @xmath74 ; the results essentially agree with those in @xcite , differences being attributable to the fact that with purely resistive coupling the output waveform is no longer a clean sinusoid , so the total power differs from the first - harmonic power . the maximum output power dissipated by the a.c .",
    "component is @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and changes very little in the range 310 ( we note parenthetically that these numbers are reminiscent of those obtained in an early study @xcite of a resonant - fluxon oscillator with pure-@xmath0 loading ) .",
    "this value is represented in fig .",
    "[ pvsr ] and fig .",
    "[ pvsc ] as a horizontal straight line for the sake of comparison with the @xmath47 case .",
    "the @xmath47 case is , at first sight , more complex , as has already been noted by zhang ( see section 4.4 of @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ pvsr ] we report the output power as a function of the resistance @xmath51 for fixed values of the ratio @xmath77 .",
    "we see that the power increases as the oscillator frequency grows with respect to the load characteristic frequency , and that it is not a monotonic function of the resistance .",
    "in fact , maximum output power is obtained for @xmath78 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the load resistance @xmath51 is close to the junction characteristic impedance @xmath52 .",
    "this result is consistent with what one should expect from considering the best matching condition in the framework of ( linear ) microwave transmission line theory .",
    "we remark also that the variation of the output power is negligible for @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "[ pvsr ] the comparison with the curve with @xmath80 shows in which range the @xmath47 loaded ffo is more efficient than the @xmath0 loaded ffo .    in fig .",
    "[ pvsc ] , in order to provide a more straightforward tool for device design , we plot the output power as a function of the load capacitance for fixed values of the load resistance @xmath51 . for a given value of @xmath51 ,",
    "the power is first an increasing function of @xmath81 which , however , quickly saturates .",
    "the asymptotic values lie on the curve with @xmath82 of fig .",
    "[ pvsr ] , which well approximates the case of infinite capacitance .",
    "whereas , as mentioned above , the @xmath47 case appears at first to be more complicated than the pure-@xmath0 case , in fact it is simpler : once the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in eq .",
    "[ pl ] are established by the junction dynamics , at least for the parameter values that we have studied , the oscillator behaves with respect to the load much as a simple linear oscillator , characterized by a fixed internal voltage and a fixed internal resistance equal to @xmath52 .",
    "this operational simplicity is obtained essentially from the elimination of the d.c .",
    "loading of the oscillator , which , instead , is present in the pure-@xmath0 case .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , in order to maximize the output power for a given value of the resistance , it is recommendable to increase the load capacitance , because the best coupling is obtained for @xmath85 . to check whether this indication can be translated into realistic parameters to design and fabricate a device",
    ", we shall estimate what one should expect in two practical cases . in both cases",
    "we shall estimate @xmath86 from the formula @xmath87 , with the usual meaning of the parameters .",
    "first , we shall consider the high-@xmath2 case , and we shall suppose that the coupling capacitor is a typical silicon monoxide element ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 nm and @xmath90 m @xmath91 m ) . since @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath1 is the junction capacitance per unit area ,",
    "the previous definitions give :      assuming from the literature @xmath95 ka/@xmath96 , @xmath97 nm , @xmath98 nm , @xmath99 ff/@xmath100m@xmath101 , we finally get @xmath102 . to evaluate the power dissipated in the load , we can use the same figures , and find that @xmath103w ; this gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the power that could be extracted .",
    "next , let us consider a low-@xmath2 oscillator . in this case",
    ", the coupling capacitor can be made by growing a niobium oxide film by anodization ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 nm ) . from the previous formula , assuming typical parameters for nb - alo@xmath106-nb josephson junctions ( @xmath107 ka/@xmath96 , @xmath108 m , @xmath109 nm , @xmath110 ff/@xmath111 ) , we find @xmath112 .",
    "of course , in this case one is left with the problem of fabricating a load resistor that should be perhaps 0.1 ohm ( or less ) , but this is feasible with present - day technology ; moreover , our numerical simulations should be considered as being merely indicative , in that the dissipation in a low-@xmath2 junction can be significantly lower than the value considered in this paper , which might bring about qualitative changes in the dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , we think that it is interesting to take into account a design based on the well established niobium technology , and we shall explore this topic in more detail in the future .",
