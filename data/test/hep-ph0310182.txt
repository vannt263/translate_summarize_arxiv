    "supersymmetry @xcite provides us with a stable bridge @xcite between the electroweak scale of @xmath5 where laboratory experiments in particle physics are performed , and the grand unification / planck scale of @xmath6 / @xmath7 where all phenomena observed at low energies are expected to be rooted in a fundamental theory including gravity . bridging more than fourteen orders of magnitude requires a base of high precision experiments from which the extrapolation to the planck scale can be carried out in a solid way .",
    "such a program has already been pursued very successfully for the three gauge couplings which appear to unify at the high scale @xcite .",
    "a parallel program should be carried out in supersymmetric theories for the other fundamental parameters @xcite , including the parameters of soft supersymmetry breaking , which may be transferred from a hidden sector near the planck scale by gravitational interactions to our visible world .",
    "a solid base for these extrapolations can be built by experiments at high - energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders @xcite which , if operated with high luminosity , will enable us to map out a comprehensive and precise picture of the supersymmetric sector at the electroweak scale .",
    "after the chargino and neutralino sectors @xcite have been explored earlier , we will concentrate in this analysis on the charged scalar lepton sector of the first and second generation , in which mixing phenomena are expected to be strongly suppressed . [",
    "the third generation and the neutral sector will be summarized in two later addenda while the colored sector will be analyzed in a separate report .",
    "] we have elaborated the processes @xmath8 \\intertext{and } \\begin{aligned }                 e^+e^- & \\to { { \\tilde{e}}}^+_i { { \\tilde{e}}}^-_j \\\\                 e^-e^- & \\to { { \\tilde{e}}}^-_i { { \\tilde{e}}}^-_j \\end{aligned } \\phantom{{{\\tilde{\\mu}}}^+_i { { \\tilde{\\mu}}}^-_i } & [ i , j = { { \\rm l}},{{\\rm r}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the level of one - loop accuracy . at the thresholds",
    "we have calculated the production cross - sections for off - shell particles including the non - zero width effects and the coulombic sommerfeld rescattering corrections , while in the continuum the supersymmetric one - loop corrections have been calculated for on - shell slepton production .    the threshold production of smuons , mediated by s - channel photon and @xmath9-boson exchanges , proceeds through p - waves , giving rise to the moderately steep @xmath10 behavior of the cross - sections in the velocity @xmath11 of the smuons .",
    "the accuracy that can be reached in measurements of the masses @xmath12 through threshold scans , is nevertheless competitive with the accuracy achieved in the continuum by reconstructing the particles through decay products in the final states .",
    "non - diagonal and diagonal pairs of selectrons however can be excited in s - waves in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions , mediated by t - channel neutralino exchange , and they give rise to the linear @xmath13 dependence of the cross - sections near the thresholds @xcite .",
    "this steep onset of the excitation curves allows us to measure the selectron masses with unrivaled precision .",
    "selectron production in the continuum is strongly affected by the electron - selectron - gaugino yukawa couplings and , as result , they can be determined very precisely by measuring the cross - sections for the production processes . in this way",
    "the identity of the yukawa couplings ( @xmath14 ) with the gauge couplings ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , a basic consequence of supersymmetry , can be thoroughly investigated with high precision , as explored first in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the threshold analyses in this report adopt techniques outlined earlier in ref .",
    "the one - loop calculations in the continuum are performed in the dimensional reduction scheme ( dred ) for regularization and with on - shell renormalization of masses and couplings .",
    "this program must be carried out consistently for the slepton sector and the neutralino sector . in the loop corrections",
    "all sectors of the electroweak supersymmetric model contribute , which in general do not decouple for large supersymmetry breaking masses @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature is the appearance of anomalous threshold singularities @xcite , which show up as discontinuities in the cross - section as a function of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "they are induced by specific mass patterns of the particles in the loops @xcite , which are generally expected to be realized in supersymmetric models but which are atypical for standard model calculations .",
    "the phenomenological analyses are performed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , based on the parameters of the msugra snowmass point sps1a @xcite .",
    "they include effects of initial - state beamstrahlung radiation as well as the decays of the sleptons .",
    "all contributions are taken into account that lead to the same final state .",
    "they have been elaborated at the level typical for phenomenological simulations of processes at an @xmath0 linear collider in the tev range . besides standard model backgrounds the most important background channels inside susy",
    "are taken into account explicitly .",
    "the dominant standard backgrounds , in particular from @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 production , are eliminated _ a priori _ by proper cuts adopted from previous experimental studies @xcite . at the level of precision required here , it is also necessary to include sub - dominant contributions from off - shell production of gauge bosons and susy particles .",
    "the final picture is quite exciting : selectron masses can be determined at an accuracy of 50 mev , _",
    "i.e. _ in the per - mille range , while the masses of the less frequently produced smuons are still accessible at the per - cent level . the same level of accuracy can also be realized in measurements of the yukawa couplings of the selectron sector , thus allowing for a high - precision comparison with the corresponding gauge couplings . _ in summa _ : a high - resolution picture of the charged slepton sector in the first and second generation can be drawn by experiments at prospective @xmath0 and @xmath1 linear colliders .    the report is organized as follows . in section [ basics ]",
    "we summarize the main features of slepton production and decay in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at the born level .",
    "section [ threshold ] presents the predictions for smuon and selectron production at threshold in detail , leading us to the aforementioned accuracies expected from selectron and smuon mass measurements in threshold scans . in section [ continuum ] slepton pair production in the continuum is described , and exploited finally for measurements of the yukawa couplings in the selectron sector .",
    "partial results had been presented earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , while additional technical details can be found in ref .",
    "spectrum and properties of supersymmetric particles in the reference point sps1a , relevant for the present study , are summarized in the appendix for the sake of completeness and the reader s convenience .",
    "in this report we restrict ourselves to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as a well - defined framework .",
    "since the muon and electron masses are very small , the mixing among l- and r - smuon and -selectron states , partners of the left- and right - chiral leptons , can be neglected and the mass eigen - states correspond to the l , r eigen - states .    in the other sectors of the mssm , mixing needs to be taken into account .",
    "the mssm requires two higgs doublets @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which both acquire non - zero vacuum expectation values @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the fields mix to form the goldstone and the physical degrees of freedom with the mixing angle @xmath24 given by the ratio of the vacuum expectation values .",
    "the charged higgsinos @xmath25 and the winos @xmath26 mix to form two charginos @xmath27 @xmath28 , while the neutral higgsinos @xmath29 and the gauginos @xmath30 form four neutralino mass eigen - states @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "apart from the electroweak parameters , the spectrum of the charginos and neutralinos is described by three mass parameters , the higgs / higgsino parameter @xmath33 in the superpotential and the soft su(2 ) and u(1 ) gaugino parameters , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . for the charginos",
    "the mass term reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the weyl spinors of the charged winos and higgsinos .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath38 can be diagonalized by two unitary matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 according to @xmath41 generating the mass eigen - states @xmath42 . in the chiral representation ,",
    "the dirac spinors @xmath27 of the charginos are constructed from the weyl spinors as follows , @xmath43 \\overline{\\chi^+_i } \\end{pmatrix } \\quad\\mbox { and } \\quad { \\tilde{\\chi}}^+_i = \\begin{pmatrix } \\chi^+_i \\\\[1ex ] \\overline{\\chi^-_i } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{eq : chaspin}\\ ] ]    the neutralino mass term in the current eigen - basis is given by @xmath44 with the symmetric mass matrix @xmath45 in which the abbreviations @xmath46 and @xmath47 have been introduced ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the sine and cosine of the electroweak mixing angle .",
    "the transition to the mass eigen - basis is performed by the unitary mixing matrix @xmath50 , @xmath51 the majorana spinors @xmath31 of the physical neutralinos are composed of the weyl spinors as @xmath52 \\overline{\\chi^0_i } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{eq : neuspin}\\ ] ] explicit analytical solutions for the mixing matrices can be found in ref .",

    "@xcite . ]      in supersymmetric theories with r - parity conservation scalar leptons are produced in pairs . since mixing",
    "can be neglected , the pairs are built of the current eigen - states with chiral index l or r.    ._classification of smuon and selectron production modes in terms of the exchanged particles , the orbital angular momentum of the final state wave function and the rise of the excitation curve near threshold .",
    "specific beam polarization states are required for the individual channels . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : spectrum ]    the staus , squarks and higgs bosons only enter in the loop corrections to smuon and selectron pair - production .",
    "the masses of the higgs bosons in the loop contributions must be evaluated at tree level , in order to ensure the cancellation of gauge - parameter dependence in the next - to - leading order result . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the background processes considered in section [ fsana ] involve tree - level higgs boson exchanges . in order to get reliable predictions for these processes",
    ", it is necessary to include the large radiative corrections to the higgs masses , which for this purpose were calculated with the program _",

    "the amount of cold dark matter is , with @xmath55 , still compatible with wmap data but somewhat on the high side if they are supplemented by the acbar and cbi data .",
    "shifting the scalar mass parameter slightly downwards to @xmath56 gev , but not altering any of the other universal parameters in sps1a , drives the value for the density of cold dark matter to the central band of the data , @xmath57 , without violating the bounds on br@xmath53 $ ] and @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "slepton , chargino / neutralino masses and branching ratios relevant for the present analysis change within so limited a margin that none of the conclusions in this report is affected to a significant amount .",
    "we benefited from many helpful remarks by h.  u.  martyn on experimental slepton analyses at @xmath0 linear colliders .",

    "<S> threshold production can be exploited for measurements of the selectron and smuon masses , an essential ingredient for the reconstruction of the fundamental supersymmetric theory at high scales . </S>",
    "<S> the production of selectrons in the continuum will allow us to determine the yukawa couplings in the selectron sector , scrutinizing the identity of the yukawa and gauge couplings , which is a basic consequence of supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions are elaborated at the one - loop level in the continuum , while at threshold non - zero width effects and sommerfeld rescattering corrections are included . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological analyses are performed for @xmath0 and @xmath1 linear colliders with energy up to about 1 tev and with high integrated luminosity up to 1 ab@xmath2 to cover the individual slepton channels separately with high precision .    </S>",
