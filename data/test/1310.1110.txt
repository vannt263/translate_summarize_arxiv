    "quantum correlations have a central role in quantum information processing , in quantum foundations , as well as in the physics of strongly correlated systems  @xcite . on one hand , quantum correlations , and in particular entanglement , are a resource that allows one to go beyond what classically possible in many scenarios , from communication tasks , to ( measurement - based ) quantum computing , to quantum cryptography . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - classicality of quantum correlations  be it in the form of non - locality , steering , entanglement , or discord  is one of the most distinctive traits of quantum mechanics , and challenges our understanding of quantum mechanics itself .",
    "the interplay between local and global properties of quantum states is a key aspect in the study of quantum correlations , both from a fundamental perspective and an applicative one .",

    ", two - body  interactions , relevant properties are dictated by the interplay between the allowed reduced states and global correlations , giving raise to phenomena like frustration  @xcite .",
    "the general study of the relations between the properties of the reduced states and the properties of the global state is known as the quantum marginal problem , which has seen a growing interest in the past years also for the reasons above  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study what can be inferred about the quality of the correlations of the global state given information about the two - body reduced states , aiming at answering the question : _ what correlations need to be present globally to explain what we see locally ? _ in  @xcite a characterization of multipartite entanglement in terms of",
    "even just single - party reduced states ( actually , single - party spectra ) was given , but under the assumption of dealing with a pure or quasi - pure global state .",
    "in  @xcite the possibility of dealing with global mixed states is taken into account , and examples are given where two - qubit separable states are only compatible with global entanglement , intended in the sense of lack of total separability ( see section  [ sec : definitions ] for definitions ) . in  @xcite examples",
    "are also given where genuine multipartite entanglement  a much stronger notion of global entanglement  can still be deduced from the properties of the two - body reduced states , but only when these reduced states exhibit bipartite entanglement themselves .",
    "in this work we present several results that complement and generalize those of  @xcite . we offer a brief summary of our findings in table  [ table ] .",
    "firstly , we provide examples of triples of bipartite reduced states  in the simplest case , two - qubit states  that , albeit separable , are only compatible with genuine tripartite entanglement ( lower - right corner of table  [ table ] ) . as far as we know , this is the strongest `` gap '' known between the entanglement properties of the marginals and of the global state .",
    "secondly , we address the issue of relating the general quantumness of correlations  @xcite of reduced states to the quantum correlations of the global state .",
    "we find that strictly classical reduced states may still be compatible only with global entanglement ( upper - left corner of table  [ table ] ) .",
    "thirdly , we find that , at least for qubits , the strict classicality of the two - body correlations makes it impossible to certify genuine tripartite entanglement based on the knowledge of the reductions : strictly classical two - qubit reduced states are always compatible with a global state that is not genuine tripartite entangled ( upper - right corner of table  [ table ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : definitions ] we define the relevant notions of correlations and classicality , and of compatibility of two - body reduced states in tripartite systems . in section  [ sec : classicalcomp ] we study the relation between the classicality of reductions and their compatibility . in section  [ sec : genuine ] we prove that unentangled reduced states may only be compatible with genuine multipartite entanglement at the level of the global state .",

    "since ( i ) is not changed under ilos , it follows from ( i ) that @xmath252 is not parallel to any state @xmath257otherwise @xmath258 would not be @xmath117-finite . since @xmath252 is real , the two @xmath259-dimensional subspaces @xmath260 and @xmath261 are equal and spanned by @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",

    "the three two - qubit marginals @xmath281 , @xmath255 and @xmath282 are positive under partial transposition ( ppt ) , so they are separable  @xcite .",

    "the example shows that for any fixed local dimension @xmath286 , there exist triples of two - qudit separable states that are only compatible with genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "the `` core '' of our construction is the genuine multipartite entangled three - qubit state @xmath287 of eq .  .",
    "it turns out that @xmath287 is actually the only state compatible with its reductions .",
    "the proof of this is given in the appendix .",
    "it is worth comparing this with the results of  @xcite .",
    "there it was proven that for almost all pure entangled states of three qubits @xmath288 it holds @xmath289 , with the exception of states of the generalized ghz form @xmath290 ( up to local unitary transformations ) , which satisfy , e.g. , @xmath291 .",
    "interestingly , the only three - qubit pure states that have separable reduction are of the generalized ghz form  @xcite .",
    "this implies that any three - qubit state @xmath129 such that ( i ) its reductions are separable and ( ii ) @xmath292 , must be mixed . since the state @xmath287 has rank two , we can think of it as the simplest possible example that satisfies ( i ) and ( ii ) , with the additional property of being uniquely determined by its reductions .",
    "we generalize example  [ ex : main ] in several ways , all presented in the appendix .",
    "while we showed that there exist genuine multipartite states whose compatibility set contains only genuine multipartite states , it is natural to ask how common this phenomenon is , i.e. , whether such states have finite volume in the set of all states .",
    "this is important also from the point of view of the potential realization of such states in the lab , which can never be perfect .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "we introduce a parameter of compatibility of a tripartite state @xmath30 with @xmath293 as @xmath294 , where we have used the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath295   in its arguments and the fact that @xmath296 is positive and vanishes if an only if @xmath297 . ] .",
    "we further define @xmath298 .",
    "we have @xmath299 for any triple @xmath300 such that @xmath301 , even if the triple of reduced states is compatible , as in example  [ ex : main ] .",

    "since the set of biseparable states is closed , there exists @xmath309 such that @xmath310 is genuine multipartite entangled for all @xmath306 and all @xmath311 . since @xmath306 is fully separable , so are the two - party reduced states of @xmath312 . furthermore , since @xmath313 is continuous , there exists @xmath314 such that @xmath315 for all @xmath306 and all @xmath316 .    for any local finite dimensions ,",
    "the set of fully separable states has non - zero volume among all states , because there exists a ball of fully separable states around the maximally mixed state  @xcite .",
    "thus , the argument above proves that also the set of tripartite states whose two - party marginals are separable but only compatible with genuine multipartite entanglement has non - zero volume .",
    "we analyzed the relation between the character of correlations of tripartite states and the ones exhibited by their bipartite reductions , i.e. , a version of the quantum marginal problem that focuses on the compatibility of bipartite reductions with certain global properties .",
    "we constructed examples where separable reductions are only compatible with genuine multipartite entanglement . up to our knowledge , this is the `` largest '' known separation between the character of correlations of bipartite reductions and what can be inferred about the quality of correlations of the global state , based only on the knowledge of the reductions . on the other hand , at least for qubits we were able to prove that compatible reductions that are fully classical can always originate from a biseparable global state .",
    "nonetheless , bipartite reductions that are fully classical may still require the presence of some entanglement in the global state .",
    "our results show that the relation between global and `` local '' correlations is far from trivial .",
    "notably , the notion of fully classical correlations is strong enough to `` break '' the need for genuine multipartite entanglement , but not the potential need for global entanglement altogether .",
    "an interesting open question is whether compatible classical - classical marginals in high dimension are always compatible with a biseparable tripartite state .",
    "another question is how to quantitatively bound the certifiable genuine multipartite entanglement in terms of the non - classicality of the two - body reductions , at least in the three - qubit case .",
    "the latter problem is reminiscent of the case of entanglement distribution , where the non - classicality of correlations  rather than the entanglement  present between a quantum carrier and distant labs constitutes a bound on the entanglement that can be generated between the labs by exchanging the carrier  @xcite .",
