    "classical spin liquids @xcite , such as the coulomb phase @xcite in spin ice @xcite and related systems , are examples of phases whose behavior is not captured by the standard landau picture of broken symmetries @xcite .",
    "their two defining characteristics are fractionalization , the emergence of excitations not constructed from finite combinations of the elementary degrees of freedom , and topological order , the presence of structure that can only be discerned by observing the system globally @xcite .    in the case of the classical spin ices",
    "@xcite , a family of magnetic pyrochlore oxides , the consequences of these properties have been of sustained interest , from both theoretical and experimental perspectives .",
    "the spins in these materials carry large magnetic moments , and their fractional excitations take the form of magnetic monopoles @xcite , acting as sources for the physical magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , transitions between phases where these excitations are confined and deconfined have particularly interesting properties that can not be captured by the landau  ginzburg theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "spin ice also has the unusual feature that the magnetization is a topologically constrained quantity , and so topological order can be probed directly @xcite . in particular , within the low - energy configuration space relevant at low temperatures , any local dynamics conserves the uniform magnetization @xcite .",
    "this fact is known to have interesting consequences for critical properties at certain confinement transitions , such as the kasteleyn transition in an applied magnetic field @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the interplay between these two aspects of the coulomb spin liquid by studying confinement phase transitions in spin ice across the full range of magnetization . as noted by henley @xcite , one can distinguish three categories of phase transition from the coulomb phase : the first , where the magnetization is zero across the transiton , was studied systematically in ref .",
    "@xcite . a second , where the ordered state has saturated polarization ,",
    "was considered in refs .",
    "here we consider the phase structure and transitions more generally , including the third case , where the magnetization is nonzero but unsaturated , and may or may not change across the transition .    to do so , we introduce a mean - field theory ( mft ) designed to capture the distinction between confined and deconfined phases .",
    "standard mean - field approaches , based on the landau picture of ordered phases , are not well suited to describing confinement transitions .",
    "instead , we take inspiration from the well - known mft for the bose  hubbard model @xcite , making use of a mapping from spin ice to a quantum model of bosons @xcite .",
    "we apply the method to a simplified model of classical spin ice , in order to illustrate the general approach and its physical interpretation .",
    "we also briefly discuss extensions to the method that could be used to treat more physically realistic perturbations .",
    "in addition , we present arguments for the generality of our results , beyond mean - field theory and our particular choice of hamiltonian .",
    "we argue that the phase diagram generically consists of a set of confined phases at low temperature in which the magnetization is , to a very good approximation , fixed .",
    "this plateau structure is strongly reminiscent of the lobes present in the phase diagram of the bose ",
    "hubbard model @xcite , a connection that helps clarify the general phase structure .",
    "while the focus here is on classical spin ice in a @xmath0 $ ] field , the distinction between transitions in different flux sectors is more general .",
    "for example , spin ice in a field along the @xmath1 $ ] direction also exhibits magnetization plateaux @xcite , while it has been suggested that the zero - field ground state of quantum spin ice may have nonzero magnetization @xcite .    in section  [ secmodel ]",
    ", we introduce the model to be used and briefly outline the general properties of the coulomb phase and confinement transitions .",
    "the mean - field method is then described and applied to the model in section  [ secmeanfieldtheory ] .",
    "we present general arguments for the phase structure and the nature of the phase transitions in section  [ secphasestructure ] , before concluding in section  [ secconclusions ] .",
    "our presentation will be based on the case of classical spin ice in a magnetic field applied along the @xmath0 $ ] crystallographic direction .",
    "we first introduce the nearest - neighbor model of spin ice ( nnsi ) that describes the physics of the coulomb spin liquid , before discussing perturbations , such as an applied field , and the resulting ordering transitions .",
    "the spin ices @xcite are a family of frustrated magnetic materials with moments on the sites @xmath2 of a pyrochlore lattice , a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "prominent examples are the `` classical '' spin ices , such as @xmath3  and @xmath4 , which are well described in terms of classical spins @xmath5 .",
    "each spin is subject to strong easy - axis anisotropy along the local @xmath6 direction @xmath7 which joins the centres of the two tetrahedra sharing site @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtetrpair ] .",
    "( shown as green arrows ) lie at the sites @xmath2 of the lattice and are constrained to point along the local @xmath6 axes ( dashed lines ) that join the centers of adjacent tetrahedra.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the anisotropy results from a large ( of order ) crystal - field splitting between states with maximum projection along @xmath7 and all other states in the single - moment hilbert space .",
    "this large gap ensures that tunneling processes between the low - energy states are strongly suppressed , rendering the moments effectively classical @xcite .",
    "for the low temperatures of interest , it is therefore sufficient to treat the spins as effectively constrained to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a classical ising variable .",
    "each tetrahedron @xmath10 in the pyrochlore lattice can be labeled according to its orientation @xmath11 , and the lattice structure is such that all neighbors of @xmath10 have orientation @xmath12 .",
    "the fixed unit vector @xmath7 for each pyrochlore site @xmath2 , directed along the line joining the centers of its two tetrahedra , can be chosen to point towards the tetrahedron with @xmath13 , and so @xmath14 indicates whether @xmath5 points out of ( @xmath15 ) or into ( @xmath16 ) tetrahedron @xmath10 . with this convention , @xmath17 and hence @xmath18 , for all nearest neighbors @xmath2 and @xmath19 .",
    "the minimal hamiltonian that captures the spin - liquid physics of the classical spin ices @xcite contains only interactions between nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath20 , @xmath21 the coupling between moments @xmath5 is ferromagnetic ( @xmath22 ) , incorporating the net effect of the dipolar interactions between nearest neighbors and ( antiferromagnetic ) exchange @xcite . the effective interactions between the ising variables @xmath23 are therefore antiferromagnetic , and hence frustrated .",
    "further - neighbor interactions , both dipolar and exchange , are significant in spin ice , but can be treated as a relatively small perturbation to @xmath24 @xcite ; we will return to these in section  [ secperturbations ] .    because two sites are nearest neighbors if and only if they share a tetrahedron , the interactions can be rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 includes all tetrahedra ( of both orientations ) and @xmath27 is referred to as the ( fictional ) `` charge '' on tetrahedron @xmath10 in terms of a sum over its sites @xmath28 .",
    "the energy is therefore minimized by configurations with @xmath29 , which are those where two spins point into and two out of each tetrahedron .",
    "configurations that satisfy this condition are said to obey the _ ice rule _",
    "@xcite ; all configurations that do so at every tetrahedron are degenerate minimal - energy states of @xmath24 .    tetrahedron configurations with three spins in and one out , or vice versa , have energy @xmath30 above the ice - rule configurations ; they have charge @xmath31 and are hence referred to as `` monopoles '' .",
    "( note that @xmath32 , and so all configurations are globally charge - neutral . ) for @xmath3 , the effective nearest - neighbor coupling is @xmath33 @xcite , corresponding to a monopole cost of @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding boltzmann weight @xmath35 is called the monopole fugacity . while the significance of the term `` monopole '' is here",
    "only that they carry effective `` charge '' @xmath36 , it has been argued that monopole excitations in the classical spin ice materials in fact carry true magnetic charge @xcite .    for temperature @xmath37 significantly below @xmath38 ,",
    "the system is effectively constrained by the ice rule , and the ensemble of ice - rule configurations therefore determines its behavior @xcite .",
    "the number of such configurations grows exponentially with the total number of spins @xmath39 , and so the entropy density remains nonzero even well below @xmath38 , the temperature scale at which an unfrustrated system would order . in spite of the absence of order , the ensemble exhibits correlations that decay only algebraically with distance .",
    "the resulting correlated paramagnet is referred to as a coulomb phase @xcite , and is an example of a classical spin liquid @xcite .",
    "the long - wavelength properties of the coulomb phase can be captured by coarse - graining the vector spins @xmath40 to give a continuum field @xmath41 referred to as the effective `` magnetic field '' @xcite .",
    "the ice - rule constraint applied to @xmath40 implies that @xmath42 is divergenceless , while monopoles act as sources or sinks , according to an effective gauss law .",
    "the resulting predictions for spin ",
    "spin correlation functions are in good agreement with neutron - scattering experiments in classical spin ice @xcite",
    ".    the ice - rule configurations also display interesting topological properties @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the most important is that any pair of ice - rule configurations is connected by flipping all spins along one or more loops . for a system with periodic boundary conditions ( which we will assume ) ,",
    "such a loop can only change the total magnetization @xmath43 if it has nontrivial winding number . for other systems that host coulomb phases @xcite , such as classical dimer models , an analogous quantity , called the `` flux '' ,",
    "can be defined , but does not necessarily correspond to a quantity that is so directly accessible experimentally .",
    "a second important property of the coulomb phase is that monopoles , defects in the ice rule , are deconfined @xcite . to make this statement precise ,",
    "imagine imposing a pair of monopoles with opposite charges @xmath44 at tetrahedra @xmath10 and @xmath45 in a background that otherwise obeys the ice rule .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the set of spin configurations @xmath47 compatible with this charge configuration .",
    "their number @xmath48 is a function of the separation @xmath49 that decreases with @xmath50 but reaches a finite limit as @xmath51 .",
    "the result is an effective entropic interaction @xmath52 between the charges that is bounded , and hence allows them to be separated to infinity at finite free - energy cost .",
    "in fact , since monopoles are charges in the continuum field @xmath42 , coarse - graining predicts that the interaction obeys the coulomb law , @xmath53 , for large @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "more generally , consider the partition function @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a perturbation that splits the degeneracy of the ice - rule configurations .",
    "this will tend to suppress fluctuations , and can eventually , as the temperature is reduced compared to the scale of the perturbation , drive the system out of the coulomb phase . a transition into a phase where @xmath57 increases without limit as @xmath51 , and so @xmath58 ,",
    "is referred to as a confinement transition @xcite .",
    "( in terms of the effective continuum field @xmath42 , gauss law implies that an imposed pair of charges must be joined by a fixed quantity of flux .",
    "linear confinement , where @xmath59 for large @xmath60 , occurs when the flux forms a narrow tube connecting the monopoles , with finite tension . )",
    "while confinement may occur simultaneously with appearance of conventional symmetry - breaking order @xcite , there is no local order parameter that provides a signature of confinement .",
    "the confinement criterion , that @xmath61 approaches zero as @xmath51 in a confined phase and conversely has a finite limit in a deconfined phase , instead resembles the characterization of a conventional symmetry - broken phase in terms of long - range order .",
    "this connection can be pursued further by considering the partition function with an unconstrained charge distribution and a position - dependent fugacity @xmath62 , @xmath63 = \\sum_{\\{\\sigma_i\\ } } { \\mathrm{e}}^{-v / t } \\prod_t \\zeta_t^{\\lvert q_t \\rvert}{\\,{\\text{,}}}\\ ] ] in terms of which @xcite @xmath64 \\right\\rvert_{\\zeta_\\cdot = 0}{\\,{\\text { , } } } \\label{eqmonopoledistributionfunction}\\ ] ] where @xmath65\\right\\rvert_{\\zeta_\\cdot = 0}$ ] is the partition function restricted to ice - rule configurations .",
    "the relationship between the monopole distribution function @xmath66 and the fugacity @xmath67 expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eqmonopoledistributionfunction ] ) is exactly analogous to the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem relating , for example , a spin ",
    "spin correlation function and an applied field .",
    "this connection motivates a mean - field theory , analogous to standard weiss theory @xcite , that describes the confinement transition in terms of an effective self - consistent fugacity .",
    "it should be noted that the confinement distinction is only sharp in the limit @xmath68 , because any nonzero density of monopoles screens the effective interaction @xmath69 at large separation .",
    "there are nonetheless implications for the critical properties away from this limit @xcite .",
    "if the phase transition also involves a different type of order ( such as spontaneous symmetry breaking ) , then it may survive for @xmath70 , but with a different universality class @xcite .      within the nearest - neighbor model @xmath24 , all configurations that obey the ice rules are degenerate and the system exhibits a deconfining coulomb phase .",
    "to drive a confinement transition , one must add perturbations that split the degeneracy of the ice - rule configurations .",
    "here we consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the coupling to an applied magnetic field and @xmath73 contains additional interactions described below .",
    "coupling to a magnetic field @xmath74 is described by a zeeman term @xmath75 where a factor dependent on the size of the magnetic moments has been included in the definition of @xmath74 .",
    "the case that we consider here has @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a unit vector along @xmath0 $ ] , and so @xmath78 . the coupling can therefore be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 . using the choice described in section  [ secnnsi ] , where @xmath7 points towards the tetrahedron with @xmath13 , @xmath81 alternates in sign on successive @xmath82 planes of spins .",
    "the component of the magnetization along the field can likewise be expressed as @xmath83    the perturbation @xmath72 alone can drive a confinement transition , referred to as a kasteleyn transition @xcite . for @xmath84 ,",
    "all spins align with the field ( to the extent allowed by the easy - axis anisotropy ) , an arrangement that satisfies the ice rules .",
    "any excitation within the ice - rule states involves flipping a loop of spins , but starting from the fully polarized state , the only available loops span the system in the @xmath0 $ ] direction .",
    "such excitations therefore have energy cost proportional to the linear system size @xmath85 and are suppressed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the result is a strictly saturated magnetization @xmath86 even for nonzero @xmath87 ( but in the limit @xmath88 ) . above a temperature @xmath89 ,",
    "however , the energy cost is outweighed by the gain in entropy , also @xmath90 , associated with the multitude of available paths for a spanning loop , and a kasteleyn transition occurs from the saturated paramagnet to the coulomb phase .",
    "the transition is possible only because the ice rule restricts to loop - like excitations ; away from the limit @xmath91 , the transition is replaced by a crossover @xcite .    to study the interplay between the topological constraints on the magnetization , inherent in the ice - rule configurations , and conventional ordering transitions , we also consider an additional interaction @xmath73 that induces spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ". a natural choice would be the further - neighbor coupling present in the spin - ice compounds , due to a combination of further - neighbor exchange @xcite and long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "the latter have been shown using monte carlo @xcite to lead to a phase transition into the ordered configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ figmdg ] , which we will call the melko  den hertog  gingras ( mdg ) state @xcite .     and ordering wavevector along @xmath0 $ ] ( vertical ) .",
    "the spins in each @xmath82 plane are aligned ( to the extent allowed by the local easy axes ) , and between successive planes the magnetization rotates in the right - handed sense by @xmath92 .",

    "it is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the set of nearest - neighbor bonds highlighted in fig .",
    "[ figmdg ] , which form a set of left - handed screw chains .",
    "the effect of @xmath96 is to reduce the strength of the interactions on these bonds and to favor the mdg configuration shown , or the one with all spins inverted .",
    "[ figtetrgrid ] shows the energy for each of the six configurations of a single tetrahedron that obey the ice rule , including both the applied field and the perturbation @xmath73 .    ,",

    "the red bonds , as in fig .",
    "[ figmdg ] , are those where the ferromagnetic coupling is reduced by @xmath93 .",
    "the configurations favored by this perturbation are therefore those in the right column where the spins joined by the red bond are antialigned . ]    unlike dipolar interactions , the perturbation @xmath73 reduces the symmetry of the lattice by picking an axis and a chirality .",
    "the 12-fold degeneracy of the mdg state is therefore reduced by a factor of @xmath98 , but the symmetry under inversion of all spins remains , and so an ordering transition into this state spontaneously breaks an ising symmetry .",
    "this transition ( at @xmath99 ) is in fact a type considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was argued to be most likely of first order .",
    "as we will show , this simplified model has a phase diagram that illustrates general features emerging from the interplay between deconfinement , ordering , and topological constraints . in section  [ secconclusions ] , we will briefly discuss the prospects for including more realistic perturbations in the mean - field theory .",
    "some aspects of the phase structure can be elucidated using a mapping between classical spin ice and an effective quantum model of hard - core bosons on a lattice @xcite .",
    "this proceeds by identifying the @xmath0 $ ] direction , along which the external field is applied , with the imaginary - time axis in a path - integral representation of the quantum problem .",
    "the thermodynamic limit of the original classical system therefore corresponds to the zero - temperature limit in the quantum problem .",
    "this mapping has previously been studied in detail for the hamiltonian @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the fully polarized state ( along the @xmath101 direction , say ) is identified with the vacuum ; flipped spins relative to this configuration form system - spanning loops , which are viewed as the world lines of bosons .",
    "the result is an effective model of hard - core bosons on a lattice with density @xmath102 and hence chemical potential @xmath103 . in general",
    ", one expects all other local terms compatible with symmetry , such as hopping between nearby sites and further - neighbor interactions , with parameters related in nontrivial ways to those of the spin model @xcite .    as @xmath104",
    "is increased , the system passes from the vacuum through a quantum phase transition @xcite to a superfluid , which corresponds to the coulomb phase of spin ice .",

    "critical properties at the phase transitions in spin ice are , _ mutatis mutandis _ , equivalent to those in the quantum model @xcite .",
    "the presence of interactions between bosons on different lattice sites also makes possible mott insulators with fractional filling .",
    "these can be identified with confining phases of spin ice ( because they lack superfluid order ) in which the magnetization is fixed to a value less than @xmath107 .",
    "the mdg phase , for example , is an ordered phase with @xmath108 , and corresponds to a mott insulator at half filling .    in general ,",
    "more exotic phases such as supersolids are also possible in the effective quantum model .",
    "a supersolid would correspond to a coulomb phase with broken spatial symmetry ; such phases have been proposed in spin ice @xcite , but are not captured by the mean - field theory used here .",

    "( [ eqhamiltonian ] ) is expected to contain : the coulomb phase , characterized by deconfinement of monopoles ; the saturated paramagnet , in which fluctuations are suppressed by the ice - rule constraints ; and the mdg phase , with conventional order that breaks spin - inversion and spatial symmetries .",
    "a mean - field theory that describes all three must therefore capture the confinement  deconfinement distinction , unlike mean - field approaches based on finite clusters @xcite , and also respect the spatial structure , unlike bethe - lattice calculations @xcite .",

    ", we capture the confinement  deconfinement transition by introducing an effective self - consistent fugacity @xmath110 for monopoles .",

    "it should be emphasized that this differs from the standard mean - field approach for classical statistical systems , where one chooses a trial distribution to minimize the free energy .",
    "( the latter method can not be used , because a trial configuration with nonzero fugacity does not enforce the ice rule and therefore has infinite energy . )",
