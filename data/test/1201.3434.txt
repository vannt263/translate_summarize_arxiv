    "it is well known that photons are ideal carriers in all - optical quantum information processing and computation since of their potentially wide range of applications and that they suffer little from decoherence .",
    "the lack of effective coherent photon - photon interactions and strong optical nonlinearities previously result in a serious obstacle to perform quantum computation and communication in conventional optical systems @xcite .",
    "fortunately , it has already been realized that a strong enough optical nonlinearity , typically kerr nonlinearity , which corresponds to the refractive part of third - order susceptibilities in an optical medium and plays a pivotal role in the field of nonlinear optics , could be available to mediate a photon - photon interaction @xcite .    in the early days of nonlinear optics , in spite of the far - off resonance or resonant excitation schemes ,",
    "the kerr nonlinearity is very small or may include serious optical absorption .",
    "simultaneously , a large third - order susceptibilities requires the linear susceptibility to be as small as possible for the sake of minimizing the absorption of all fields participating in the nonlinear process @xcite .",
    "however , this difficult can be solved by introducing the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in such systems , which is capable of modifying the linear and nonlinear optical properties of medium predominantly in the resonant atomic systems @xcite .",
    "namely , a large cross - kerr nonlinearity with nonabsorption have been studied theoretically and experimentally in the atomic system through eit or eit related technology .",
    "for example , schmidt and imamolu proposed a cross - phase modulation scheme based on the eit in a four - level atomic system @xcite , kang and zhu experimentally observed a large kerr nonlinearity within vanishing linear susceptibilities in rubidium atoms @xcite , as well as the possibility of highly efficient four - wave mixing and ultra - slow optical solitons has also been explored intensively @xcite .",
    "recently , it is extremely interesting to extend these quantum coherence and interference effects to the solid state systems , including semiconductor quantum wells ( qw ) and quantum dots , of which the discrete energy levels and optical properties are extremely analogy to atomic systems . as a consequence ,",
    "there have been numerous developments on the quantum coherence and interference effects in semiconductor qw systems , for example , eit and double eit @xcite , ultrafast all - optical switching @xcite , slow light solitons @xcite , tunneling - induced transparency and related phenomenon based on fano interference @xcite , etc .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it was generally recognized that such a semiconductor qw structures also have inherent advantages such as large electric dipole moments , high nonlinear optical coefficients , wide adjustable parameters , and flexibility . so that it is more helpful for realizing high - quality quantum coherence and more promising for practical applications . in the present paper",
    ", we adopt the gaas / algaas semiconductor qw @xcite , which have been realized in the recent experiment . in our scheme , a giant cross - kerr nonlinearity with nearly @xmath0-conditional nonlinear phase shifts and mutually matched group velocities ( slowed ) can be achieved due to cross - phase modulation effect in the context of eit , accompanied by vanishing the linear and self - kerr optical absorption .",
    "based on these characteristics , the two - qubit polarization quantum phase gate can be implemented within long - time interaction and effective maximal entanglement .",
    "since the polarization single qubit rotation gate can be easily realized , the universal quantum computation can thus be achieved @xcite .",
    "in addition , we propose a practical experimental scheme to identify the maximally entangled optical polarization state of two - qubit with two out of the four bell states .",

    "2 , we plot the linear absorbtion property [ which bases on @xmath71 versus the various detunings of the probe field @xmath72 and the control field field @xmath73 for different values of the decay rate @xmath74 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "2(a ) that for relatively small decay rate @xmath75 , a resonant probe field can propagate with little absorption ( solid curve ) when the switch beam ( control field @xmath73 ) is on .",
    "namely , in the case of @xmath76 , the probe and control fields form a `` @xmath77 configuration '' eit subsystem , which induces a dark state where the imaginary part of the linear susceptibility @xmath78 vanish .",
    "when the decay rate @xmath79 becomes relatively important [ that is , it is larger as shown in the dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , it gives rise to a resonant probe field being gradual more absorbed .",
    "this means that , at present , the response of tunneling induced interference between the two wells start to become less observable .",
    "meanwhile , we proceed to examine the linear absorption profiles corresponding to variational rabi frequency of control field @xmath80 along with the influence of the decay rate @xmath74 .",
    "we find that , in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the linear absorption coefficient @xmath81 rapidly decrease with the increase of the intensity of the control field @xmath73 ( see the solid curve ) . simultaneously , with the slightly augment of the decay rate @xmath74 , the decrease of the absorption coefficient @xmath82 becomes more and more slow .",
    "specially , under a fixed control field @xmath80 , the absorption of the probe correspondingly enhances with increasing the decay rate @xmath74 .",
    "it implies that , under an appropriate condition from the contribution of the control field @xmath80 and the decay rate @xmath74 , the linear absorption of the probe field can be efficiently suppressed .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the third - order self - kerr nonlinear susceptibility of the probe field [ which bases on @xmath83 versus the various detunings of the probe field @xmath84 and the third - order cross - kerr nonlinear susceptibilities of the probe and signal fields [ which base on @xmath85 versus the various detunings of the signal field @xmath86 , respectively . from fig .",
    "3(a ) , one can see that , under the condition @xmath87 , the self - kerr nonlinear susceptibility of the probe field can also be effectively suppressed concomitant with a appreciably wide eit transparent window , which is identical to the result we have obtained in fig .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "3(b ) , within the eit transparency window , we find that the real parts of the cross - kerr nonlinear susceptibilities of the probe and signal fields decay much more slowly than the imaginary parts .",
    "consequently , this result demonstrates that a considerable cross phase modulation with a negligible absorption can be created on demand by setting the signal field rather far off resonance .",
    "in addition to this , it can also be seen that the cross - kerr susceptibilities of the probe and signal fields , as represented in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , are of the same order of the magnitudes . therefore",
    ", these results reveal that , due to the quantum coherence and interference between the lower subbands under the eit condition , not only the self - kerr interaction can be vanished but the two cross - kerr susceptibilities can be enhanced predominantly .",
    "it is clearly shown that , with suitable parameters , the corresponding cross - kerr susceptibilities @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be predominantly enhanced in the context of eit condition .",
    "this situation corresponds to the case of the probe and control fields are approximate resonance ( @xmath76 )",
    ". then we find , by appropriate tuning the value of the control field @xmath80 and the decay rate @xmath90 , the linear absorption and self - kerr nonlinearity susceptibilities can be effectively suppressed , while the cross - kerr nonlinearity susceptibility of the probe and signal fields can be significantly enhanced .     versus the detunings of the probe field @xmath49 and ( b)the third - order cross - kerr nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath91 of the probe ( signal ) field as functions of the detunings of the signal field @xmath92 .",
    "we here make @xmath93 and @xmath94 as units in plotting .",
    "the parameters used are ( a ) @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 and ( b ) @xmath76 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath56.,width=333 ]",
    "it should be worth noting that , as first emphasized by lukin and @xmath102 @xcite , the group velocity matching of the probe and signal fields is another crucial requirement for achieving a large nonlinear mutual phase shift . only in this way",
    ", the two optical pulses can interact in an eit medium for a sufficiently long time to induce an effective cross phase modulation .",
    "the expressions of the group velocities for the probe and signal fields can be given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 . and both group velocities should be small and equal by regulating the dipole matrix elements and the probe and signal rabi frequencies together with the coefficient @xmath105 . fortunately ,",
    "if the eit - resonance condition is disturbed by a small amount , it remains under the common transparency condition and the absorption may still be considered as ignorable .    as we know",
    ", the emergence of the cross - phase modulation is a very essential condition for realizing the controlled quantum phase gate between two optical qubits . in our qw scheme ( as the four - state system shown in fig .",
    "1 ) , within the cross - kerr effect , a cross - phase modulation could be implemented whereby an optical field achieves a nonlinear phase shift relied chiefly on the situation of another optical field to generate two - qubit quantum phase gate .",
    "the quantum phase gate operation is defined by the input - output relationship as @xmath106 becomes different from zero @xcite .",
    "notice that only the `` right '' polarization ( i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively corresponds to the probe and signal fields ) of the probe and signal fields , a controlled quantum phase gate could be realized when a significant and nontrivial cross - phase modulation between them arises .",
    "when the probe field has a @xmath108 polarization ( as for a @xmath108 polarization signal field ) , namely , the `` wrong '' polarization can not couple to any levels and thus the corresponding pulse will achieve a trivial phase shift @xmath109 ( where l is the length of the medium and @xmath110 denotes the free space wave vector ) . under the cosideration that both the probe and the signal fields are @xmath108 polarization , the probe field undergoes a self - kerr effect and achieves a nontrivial phase shift @xmath111 ( which is subjected to the eit condition constituted by the @xmath77 configuration : @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath18 levels ) , with @xmath114 being the linear phase shift and @xmath115 being the nonlinear phase shift caused by the self - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "at the same time , the signal field achieve the the vacuum shift @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , for the `` right '' polarization condition , the probe and signal fields achieve the nontrivial phase shifts @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the input probe and signal polarized single - photon wave packets form a superposition of the circularly polarized states can be expressed as @xmath119 where @xmath120 , with @xmath121 being a gaussian frequency distribution of incident wave packets , centered at frequency @xmath122 .",
    "the photon field operators experience a transformation while propagating through the qw medium of length _",
    "i.e. , @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the real part of the refractive index @xmath124 can be assumed to @xmath125 , one obtains that , @xmath126%    @xmath127 , and the cross - phase shift of the probe field is given by @xmath128}{\\zeta_{p}}\\text{re}% [ \\chi_{pc}^{(3)}],\\ ] ] where @xmath129 , with @xmath130 being the width of the pulse and @xmath131 $ ] depicts the error function .",
    "the cross - phase shift of the signal field is obtained on interchanging @xmath132 in the equation above , that is @xmath133}{\\zeta_{s}}\\text{re}% [ \\chi_{sc}^{(3)}],\\ ] ] where @xmath134 can also be obtained from @xmath135 upon interchanging the indices @xmath136 . in case of meeting with the group velocity matching , so @xmath137 , i.e. , the value of @xmath138/\\zeta_{p(s)}$ ] reaches the maximum value @xmath139 .",
    "thus , after encoding @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the explicit form of the polarization two - qubit controlled quantum phase gate ( qpg ) using the present qw structure is given by    @xmath142|0\\rangle_p|0\\rangle_s,\\\\ & |0\\rangle_p|1\\rangle_s\\rightarrow \\exp\\big[-i\\big(\\varphi_p^{(0)}+\\varphi_s^{(0)}\\big)\\big]|0\\rangle_p|1\\rangle_s,\\\\ & |1\\rangle_p|1\\rangle_s\\rightarrow \\exp\\big[-i\\big(\\varphi_p^{\\lambda}+\\varphi_s^{(0)}\\big)\\big]|1\\rangle_p|1\\rangle_s , \\\\ & |1\\rangle_p|0\\rangle_s\\rightarrow\\exp\\big[-i\\big(\\varphi_p^{(t)}+\\varphi_s^{(t)}\\big)\\big]|1\\rangle_p|0\\rangle_s,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with a conditional phase shift @xmath143 is nonzero ( on the basis of the eit condition , the linear effect and self - phase modulation can be suppressed , so that @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) , and thus a two - qubit polarization controlled quantum phase gate can be realized in the coupled qw structure .    to show explicitly the form of the controlled phase gate , we next study the entanglement of the two - qubit state after the processing of eit . for our special two - qubit system , the state takes the form @xmath146 constituting by signal and probe fields .",
    "consider the input state is a factorized ( separable ) pure state @xmath147 as presented in eq.(7 ) , while the signal and probe fields @xmath148 are superposition of @xmath149 and @xmath150 with equal amplitudes @xmath151 .",
    "then by the transformation presented in eqs.(11 ) , the final state is still a pure state but with a non - trivial controlled phase so that the final state is entangled .",
    "the entanglement can be measured by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of signal field or probe field @xmath152\\nonumber\\\\ & = s(s)=-\\mathrm{tr}[\\rho_s\\log\\rho_s],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the reduced density operators of the subsystems @xmath155 and @xmath156 . simply , if @xmath157 are the eigenvalues of @xmath158 [ 1 ] , the entanglement of two - qubit expressed as von neumann entropy takes the form , @xmath159 .     with different @xmath160 . with parameters @xmath161 , @xmath162 , the others parameters used are the same as fig .",
    "2 ]    as is shown in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the result of the degree of entanglement [ von neumann entropy @xmath163 versus the detunings of the signal field @xmath164 with different @xmath160 . for simplicity",
    ", we set the value of @xmath165 as an example . for a certain intensity of control field ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath166 , we can obtain a nearly 100% degree of entanglement when @xmath167 ( which corresponds to the black solid curve in fig .",
    "4 ) , which is due to the characteristic of nonabsorption in this system . in accordance with the case of the maximum entanglement",
    ", we simultaneously achieve an approximate @xmath0 radians conditional nonlinear phase shift ( that is @xmath168 ) .",
    "it is also essential to note that the degree of entanglement of our system can be affected by the fluctuations of light intensities and the detunings of the probe and signal fields in the experimental demonstration .",
    "it is evidently shown that , a strong third - order cross - kerr nonlinearity is satisfied so that one can be capable of constructing a controlled-@xmath0 , a specific case of the controlled - phase gate for the probe and signal fields in the case of the `` right '' polarization configuration .",
    "as mentioned above , it shifts the phase of @xmath169 by @xmath0 , leaving the other three basis states unchanged . consequently by single qubit rotation of signal and probe fields , the controlled-@xmath0 transformation realized by the output modes of eqs.(11 ) , can be represented as @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which is the standard form in quantum computation . to our knowledge",
    ", this result indicates that , when reasonable regulation parameters are selected , this controlled - phase gate can create a maximally entangled state from a separable pure input state , ( 100% entanglement as shown in fig .",
    "4 ) .    since the single qubit rotation in eq .",
    "( 7 ) can be realized easily , the combination of controlled phase gate provided by eit in the semiconductor system and the single rotation gate constitutes a universal set of gates for quantum computation .     under the condition of eit effect ; pbs1,pbs2 and pbs3 are three polarization beam splitters ; and @xmath174 and @xmath175 denote the horizontally and vertically polarized signal - photon states . ]    the experimental scheme to realize the controlled quantum phase gate in the qw in gaas / algaas semiconductor system is thus finished .",
    "next , it will be interesting to check whether this scheme can indeed work , in particular , whether a maximally entangled state can be created by this controlled-@xmath0 phase gate .",
    "thus it is desirable to have a scheme for observing the maximally entangled state among the two - qubit polarization controlled quantum phase gate .",
    "we here propose a practical experiment implementation for optical bell - state analyzer in the coincidence basis , due to which one can also observe the `` right '' polarization and maximally entangled qubit . in order to explain our projection , as shown in fig . 5",
    ", we first examine that the left part of the scheme is comprised of quantum phase gate which has been described above .",
    "the right part of the scheme is comprised of three polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) , two half - wave plate and four detectors with single - photon sensitivity .",
    "we here encoded @xmath176 and @xmath177 where the tensor product of the single - photon polarization basis states , as usual @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "it is also well known that the four bell states are , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "according to the spirit of reference @xcite , by using the coincidence between the four detectors .",
    "meanwhile , we can readily identify @xmath182 in terms of bell states @xmath183/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] where the states @xmath184 and @xmath185 are ambiguously distinguishable ( as reference [ 30 ] , we can correspond @xmath186 and @xmath187 to @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively ) , thus , a half - wave plate was oriented at @xmath190 rotated the polarization of the horizontally polarized single photon to @xmath191 polarization state just before pbs2 and pbs3 , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , where ( i=1,2 ) .",
    "finally , each of the two polarizations are split by pbs2 and pbs3 into two single photon detectors , respectively . and",
    "thus @xmath184 and @xmath185 will be transformed into @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "specially , it is clear that we can also identify the maximally entangled state among the two - qubit polarization quantum phase gate , based on the bell state analyzer in this qw structures .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the measurement of total nonlinear phase shift is crucial to the experimental demonstration of the quantum phase gate .",
    "the fluctuations of light intensities and frequency detunings of the probe and signal fields will induce the errors of the nonlinear phase shift . as a consequence , there is certainly the possibility of taking all lasers phase - locked to each other for minimizing the effect of relative detuning fluctuations .",
    "and then the light intensity with fluctuations of 1% will lead to an error less than 4% in the phase measurement . besides",
    ", it should also be noted that , for the moderate density even at room temperature , the additional broadening effects ( which are induced by the carrier - carrier and carrier - photon interactions ) we have neglected are very small in comparison with the final broadening [ 26 , 31 ] .",
    "moreover , it should be pointed out that the cross - phase modulation is a very promising candidate for the design of deterministic optical controlled quantum phase gates and the probe and signal fields have been treated in a classical way .",
    "therefore , it would be a clear indication for generating the entanglement of macroscopic , coherent states instead of single - photon states .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the two - qubit controlled - phase gate on the basis of the linear and nonlinear properties of the probe and signal pulses in an asymmetric algaas / gaas coupled - double qw structure . in our scheme ,",
    "a giant cross - kerr nonlinearity ( which corresponds to @xmath0 radians conditional nonlinear phase shifts ) and mutually matched ( which is also slow ) group velocities can be achieved within the suppression of both the linear and self - kerr nonlinear optical absorption susceptibilities .",
    "such properties stems from a constructive quantum interference effect in nonlinear susceptibility of the probe and signal fields related to the cross - phase modulation induced by eit effect in our system . due to such novel features",
    ", we can be able to acquire two - qubit controlled - phase gates and high entanglement between the weak probe and signal pulses in the given system . in the mean time",
    ", it is also likely to achieve the controlled-@xmath0 gate through the optical realization of the circuit in quantum computation .",
    "furthermore , by adding just polarizing beam splitters and half - wave plates , we have proposed a practical experimental scheme , by which it comes in handy to discriminate the maximally entangled state of the two - qubit including two out of four bell states by using the coincidence between the four detectors . and that such version of the bell state analyzer can possibly be extended to the three - particle or n - particle cases . considering that an asymmetric algaas / gaas coupled - double qw structure on the basis of the intersubband transitions has already be realized experimentally @xcite ,",

    "<S> we present a realization of two - qubit controlled - phase gate , based on the linear and nonlinear properties of the probe and signal optical pulses in an asymmetric gaas / algaas double quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , in the presence of cross - phase modulation , a giant cross - kerr nonlinearity and mutually matched group velocities of the probe and signal optical pulses can be achieved while realizing the suppression of linear and self - kerr optical absorption synchronously . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics serve to exhibit an all - optical two - qubit controlled - phase gate within efficiently controllable photon - photon entanglement by semiconductor mediation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by using just polarizing beam splitters and half - wave plates , we propose a practical experimental scheme to discriminate the maximally entangled polarization state of two - qubit through distinguishing two out of the four bell states . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal potentially enables the realization of solid states mediated all - optical quantum computation and information processing . </S>"
