    "1 ) , suggests that mbcs have formed in - situ as the remnants of collisionally broken larger objects , the cometary activities of these bodies may be taken to argue that mbcs are comets that were scattered inward from the outer regions of the solar system and were captured in their current orbits .",
    "such a capture mechanism could not have occurred recently .",

    "* fernandez et al . ( 2002 ) ) have shown that , at the current dynamical state of the solar system , it would not be possible to scatter comets from regions outside the orbit of neptune to the main asteroid belt .",

    "* morbidelli et al . 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tsiganis et al . 2005 ) ) many trans - neptunian objects could have been scattered inwards and captured in orbits in the asteroid belt as close in as 2.68 au during the early state of the dynamics of the solar system . whether these objects could be the source of mbcs is , however , uncertain .",
    "this paper evaluates this possibility , in particular in comparison with the in - situ formation model , by presenting the results of a numerical study if the dynamics of the currently known mbcs , and discussing their implications for the formation and origin of these objects .",
    "as mentioned above , tails of mbcs are generated through the interactions of dust grains on the surface of these bodies with the gas produced by the sublimation of near - surface water ice ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hsieh , jewitt & fernndez 2004 ) ) . as shown by (",
    "* schorghofer ( 2008 ) ) , asteroids in the region between 2 au and 3.3 au can maintain sub - surface water ice for several billion years if their surfaces are covered by a layer of dust , even as thick as only a few meters .",
    "that implies that in order for an mbc to start its cometary activation , this dusty layer has to be removed .",
    "* hsieh & jewitt ( 2006 ) ) have suggested that collisions between mbcs and objects as small as a few meter in size , can reveal the sub - surface water ice .",
    "such collisions will result in the local exposure of ice which sublimates and creates a thin atmosphere and tail for an mbc .",
    "an activated mbc , on the other hand , may terminate its activity after sublimating all the ice at the location of its collision with a m - sized projectile .",
    "it may also start new activation if it is collided with a second m - sized object in a later time again . in other words",
    ", an mbc may be activated several times till it exhausts all its water ice , or is scattered to an unstable orbit and either leaves the asteroid belt or collides with another asteroid or a planet .",
    "it will therefore be useful to study the rate of the collisions of m - size bodies with km - size mbcs , in particular in the outer region of the asteroid belt .",
    "this paper presents the results of such simulations and discusses their implications for the activation of mbcs and the possibility of the detection of more of these objects .",

    "the effects of non - gravitational forces such as yarkovsky , and the effect of the mass - loss of mbcs due to their cometary activities were not included .",
    "since the activation of mbcs is episodic and intensifies during the perihelion passages of these objects , which is short compared to their orbital periods , the effect of the mass - loss may not alter the dynamics of these objects significantly .",
    "integrations were carried out with bulirsch - stoer and with the second - order mixed - variable symplectic ( mvs ) integrators in the n - body integration package mercury ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the in - situ formation scenario is , however , consistent with mbcs orbital and spectral properties . in this scenario ,",
    "the break up of the precursor asteroids could have produced many km - sized fragments , among which those with large inclinations and large eccentricities became unstable and were scattered to other regions .",
    "the remaining objects have naturally asteroidal orbits ( i.e. their tisserand numbers are larger than 3 ) , and similar to their parent bodies , are c - type asteroids with no specific optical color . in regard to 7968 elst - pizzaro , 118401 ( 176p / linear ) , and p/2005 u1 ( read )",
    ", this scenario points to the themis family , and perhaps a smaller @xmath22 myr sub - family ( known as beagle ) within these objects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nesvorn et al 2008 ) ) , as the origin of these mbcs .",
    "this scenario also suggest that asteroid families , in particular those in the outer half of the asteroid belt and with large parent bodies capable of differentiating and forming ice - rich mantles , are the most probable places for detecting more mbcs . as indicated by the results of the dynamical simulations , some members of such families may interact with giant planets and reach orbits in other regions of the asteroid belt  a scenario that might explain the existence of p/2008 r1 ( garradd ) in its current orbit .",
    "all sky surveys such as those with pan starrs 1 would be capable of detecting such individual mbcs , and are ideal for carrying out targeted surveys for families of these objects .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has been suggested that the tails of mbcs are dust particles that have been carried away from the surfaces of these object by the gas produced by the sublimation of water ice .",
    "this idea is based on the fact that the orbits of the currently known mbcs are in the outer part of the asteroid belt where water ice on the surface of asteroids can survive for billions of years when covered by a layer of dust ( ( * ? ? ? * schorghofer 2008 ) ) . a collision between an mbc and an object , even as small as a m - sized boulder , can expose this ice .",
    "when such an mbc , with a locally exposed sub - surface ice , approaches its perihelion , the ice sublimates and produces a weak atmosphere which lifts and carries dust particles from the surface of the mbc , giving it a cometary appearance .",
    "the number of m - sized boulders and the frequency of such collisions are not exactly known .",
    "however , it is possible to develop a simple computational model that can impose an upper limit to these collisions . in doing so",
    ", a heuristic model was developed based on the following assumptions .    1 .",
    "the asteroid belt was assumed to consist of only one asteroid , 7968 elst - pizzaro , and a disk of m - sized bodies .",
    "the surface density of the disk was set to have a @xmath23 profile .",
    "2 .   the accumulative size distribution @xmath24 of objects with diameter @xmath25 was considered to be given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 can have a value between -2 and -4 . following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dohnanyi ( 1969 ) ) , it was assumed that @xmath28 .",
    "a total of @xmath29 m - sized boulder were randomly distributed throughout the asteroid belt .",
    "the eccentricity of these objects were chosen from a range of 0 to 0.5 , and their inclinations were taken to be between 0 and @xmath0 .",
    "the orbits of the m - sized objects and that of the 7968 elst - pizzaro were integrated for 10 myr .",
    "similar to the previous simulations , integrations included all planets and pluto .",
    "results indicated that on average , one m - sized object collides with this mbc every 40,000 years .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 , a larger number of the colliding boulder come from the vicinity of 7968 elst - pizzaro .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this model is simplistic , and the results represent a high upper limit . in a more realistic model ,",
    "the numbers of large bodies and the small boulders are much higher . as a result ,",
    "many of the m - sized objects collide with their neighboring asteroids , or are ejected from the asteroid belt .",
    "it is expected that in such cases , the frequency of collisions between km - sized mbcs and m - sized boulders to decrease to approximately one every few thousand years .",
    "* current mbcs seem to have formed through the collision and break up of bigger asteroids .",
    "the results of the simulations of the dynamic of these objects point to the themis family as the origin of 7968 elst - pizzaro , 118401 ( 176p / linear ) , and p/2005 u1 ( read ) .",
    "* interaction with giant planet might have scattered mbcs from their original orbits to other locations in the asteroid belt .",
    "p/2008 r1 ( garradd ) seems to be one of such scattered mbcs . * more mbcs may exist in low inclinations and low eccentricities in the vicinity of asteroid families in the outer region of the asteroid belt . *",
    "collisions with small objects might have activated mbcs or eroded them . *",
    "many mbcs might have been active in the past and are either no longer active , or will become active if hit by a small body again .",
    "* many mbcs , with locally exposed sub - surface ice , may still be on their ways to their perihelion distances where they become active , or they may be awaiting collisions with smaller objects to get activated . * all sky surveys such as pan starrs will be able to detect more mbc in near future .",
