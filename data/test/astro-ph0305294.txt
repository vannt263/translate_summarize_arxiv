    "the galaxy luminosity function ( @xmath10 ) remains at the core of both galaxy evolution and cosmology . by integrating @xmath10 over space and time",
    ", various observable distributions can be obtained .",
    "in particular , differential number counts of galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude , @xmath0 , is obtained by integrating @xmath10 over all redshifts and morphological types .",
    "the reliability of the predicted @xmath0 values depends directly on the cosmological model and on how well the evolution of galaxies is modelled from their formation to the present .",
    "the study of number counts can therefore be used to test world models or to search for evolution during the look - back time .",
    "the function @xmath0 provides one of the most fundamental observables and has been studied by several authors ( for reviews see ellis 1997 ; koo & kron 1992 ; sandage 1988 ) .",
    "recently , a major effort has been made to reach very faint magnitudes using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "although the _ hst _ can not compete with ground - based observations in terms of collecting area , it does provide an unprecedent view of the optical sky at small angular scales and faint flux levels .",
    "a number of authors have studied faint galaxy counts based on the hubble deep field ( hdf ) @xcite and using different photometry packages @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the notation @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 to denote magnitudes in the _ hst _ passbands on the @xmath2 system @xcite .",
    "@xcite has compared the hdf catalogues available in the literature .",
    "they generally show good agreement , although the effects of different isophotal thresholds and different splitting algorithms are apparent .",
    "however , @xcite showed that , at @xmath11 , the different galaxy counts agree to within @xmath12 in all the catalogues , whereas at @xmath13 there is a factor of 1.7 difference among them .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that galaxy counting is not a precise science .    in this paper",
    ", the hdf will be used to test the validity of previous number count studies and to produce a new determination of the faint end of @xmath0 for magnitudes fainter than @xmath1 .",
    "surface - brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) measurements are used .",
    "this allows us to explore @xmath0 beyond the limiting magnitude of the hdf and to overcome most of the limitations arising from incompleteness , providing new , stronger constraints on the faint end of @xmath0 .",
    "this work is based on data from the hdf north .",
    "observations were made in 1995 december 1830 , and both raw and reduced data have been put into public domain as a community service @xcite .",
    "version 2 f450w , f606w and f814w images , released into public domain on 1996 february 29 , have been used here .    the final version 2 images were combined using the drizzle algorithm .",
    "drizzling causes the noise in one pixel to be correlated with the noise in the adjacent one @xcite .",
    "the sbf technique is based on the spectral analysis of an image . because the power spectrum of the image is modified by the drizzling process , drizzled images were not considered in this study .",
    "`` weighted and cosmic - ray cleaned '' images have been used instead .",
    "these are flat - fielded , cosmic - ray - rejected and sky - subtracted stacked images at each dither position .",
    "only dark exposures have been selected .",
    "each of the the three wide - field and the planetary camera wfpc2 chips were analyzed separately .",
    "the labels of all images considered , the corresponding filter and the total exposure times are listed in table [ t - data ] .",
    "the sbf concept was introduced by @xcite , who noted that , in the surface photometry of a galaxy far enough away to remain unresolved , a pixel - to - pixel fluctuation is observed because of the poisson statistics of the spatial distribution of stars , globular clusters , background galaxies , etc .",
    "this technique was introduced with the aim of measuring distances . comparing sbfs produced by the stellar population of a galaxy with those of nearby galaxies for which externally calibrated distances are available , accurate estimates of distances",
    "can be obtained up to @xmath1440 mpc @xcite .",
    "other authors have used sbf studies to determine the age and metallicity of unresolved stellar populations of nearby galaxies @xcite ; however , the sbf signal can provide information about other kinds of undetected and unresolved objects in an image .",
    "this is the case , for example , of globular cluster populations @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "sbfs have been used to characterize the faint end of @xmath0 using undetected galaxies in the hdf - n images .",
    "next in this section , the theoretical background of sbfs and the hdf - n signal measurement are described in detail .",
    "the sbf technique involves spectral analysis of the pixel - to - pixel fluctuation signal .",
    "this provides the total point spread function psf - convolved variance ( @xmath15 ) produced by all point objects whose spatial flux distribution is convolved with the psf , and the total non - psf - convolved variance ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a convolution in the real space transforms into a product in fourier space . for this reason",
    ", the power spectrum of an image , @xmath17 , has the form :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the power spectrum of the psf convolved with some window function .",
    "the @xmath19 can be approximated by the power spectrum of the psf alone , @xmath20 , with a negligible error @xcite .",
    "so eq .  [ pow1 ] transforms into    @xmath21    once the power spectrum of an image has been computed , the variances @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be obtained fitting eq .",
    "[ pow2 ] to data .    in hdf images",
    ", @xmath15 is mainly produced by faint galaxies , and , as we will see later , by cosmic rays .",
    "so @xmath15 must be equal to the sum of the variances produced by faint galaxies ( @xmath22 ) and by cosmic rays ( @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 on the other hand , @xmath16 is the sum of read - out noise ( @xmath25 ) , photon shot noise ( @xmath26 ) , and dark current ( @xmath27 ) variances :    @xmath28    the pixel - to - pixel variance produced by a class of objects can be evaluated as the second moment of the differential number counts of that object population @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the target population is composed by faint undetected galaxies .",
    "the brightest individuals , which are detected , must be masked out before the sbf analysis .",
    "if all sources brighter than a limiting flux ( @xmath29 ) are masked , then the variance produced by the remaining non - masked population is : @xmath30    we can put this equation in terms of magnitudes via the relationship @xmath31 @xmath32 being the flux ( @xmath33 s@xmath34 pix@xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 the magnitude of an object yielding one unit of flux per unit time ; that is , the photometric zero point listed in table [ t - zero ] .",
    "if @xmath0 is known , then the theoretical variance produced by faint galaxies can be estimated . assuming the following pure power - law form for @xmath0 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a normalizing constant and @xmath38 is the slope of the magnitude distribution , the variance produced by the non - masked galaxy population is then @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the limiting magnitude ; i.e. the magnitude corresponding to the limiting flux , @xmath29 .",
    "we will refer to this variance as the @xmath0-estimated @xmath41 from here on .",
    "as we have shown , in order to compute it , an initial @xmath0 , obtained from a given photometric catalogue , must be assumed .",
    "a number of authors have studied @xmath0 in the hdf - n .",
    "the main discrepancies between previous number count studies occur between @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these coincide for `` bright '' magnitudes , but large differences arise for fainter galaxies , the @xcite number counts being larger than those of @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , there are two reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , as we go fainter the @xcite magnitudes become systematically brighter than those of @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that the effect of this on the counts is actually quite small , generally @xmath42 .",
    "second , @xcite find objects that @xcite do not detect at all .",
    "this appears to account for the majority of the differences between the data sets .",
    "@xcite argued that virtually all of these objects are merged in the reductions of @xcite but not in their data .    in figure [ glf ] ,",
    "differential number counts results from @xcite ( filled circles ) and @xcite ( open circles ) are plotted for the f450w , f606w , and f814w filters , respectively .",
    "these data have been obtained from tables 9 and 10 in @xcite , and from tables 8 , 10 and 12 in @xcite , all expressed in the total magnitude scale .",
    "following eq .",
    "[ bglf ] , @xmath0 has been fitted to the data of @xcite and @xcite , and the fitted functions ( solid lines ) are also plotted .",
    "as @xcite found a change in the @xmath0 slope at a magnitude of around 26 , @xmath0 has been fitted to their data in the two magnitude intervals [ 23 , 26 ] and [ 26 , 29 ] .",
    "the fitted @xmath0 functions have been used in eq .",
    "[ sigma_bg ] to compute the @xmath0-estimated @xmath41 .",
    "results are listed in table [ t - sigma ] .",
    "these @xmath0-estimated @xmath41 values will be later on compared with those directly derived from the sbf measurements ( which we will call the sbf - measured @xmath41 ) .",
    "this comparison will allow us to evaluate the validity of the differential number counts of both @xcite and @xcite and , as a result , a final @xmath0 will be proposed .    before describing the details of the sbf measurements in hdf images , note that the sbf technique is valid only if faint galaxies have a stellar appearance .",
    "in @xcite the radius  magnitude relation for galaxies in the @xcite hdf catalogue has been analyzed . for magnitudes fainter than @xmath43 ,",
    "all the galaxies have a radius smaller that @xmath44 , close to the fwhm of the wf chips .",
    "so very faint galaxies , in the magnitude range where sbf will be measured , can be assumed to have a stellar appearance .      here",
    ", the practical procedure for obtaining the sbf signal in hdf - n images is described in detail .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that cosmic rays are difficult to discriminate from stars in _ hst _ frames . in order to estimate and eliminate the cosmic - ray contribution to the sbf signal , @xmath15 , a procedure",
    "based on the random nature of cosmic - ray events has been used for each filter and chip .",
    "the sbf signal has be measured not only on the final combined images , but on all the individual images listed in table [ t - data ] as well .    before computing the power spectrum of an image ,",
    "objects brighter than @xmath40 must be masked out . in this study ,",
    "the window functions have been created using the @xcite photometric catalogue , which is the only one available to us . as isophotal magnitudes were considered while creating the window functions , in order to convert them to the total magnitude scale an isophotal - to - total magnitude correction of 0.2 mag @xcite was applied .",
    "the sbf analysis have been be performed considering two different values of @xmath40 : 27.8 and 28.8 .",
    "all objects brighter than @xmath40 have been masked out using a window function whose pixel values are zero in a circle centered on the location of the bright objects and unity in the rest of the image . the window function has been created using a patch radius large enough to completely mask bright galaxies , including their external haloes and therefore merged galaxies where these exist .",
    "the procedure creating the mask has been the following : first , the brightest galaxies have been masked one by one manually . in order to avoid residual light beyond the masked regions ,",
    "very generous patch sizes have been adopted .",
    "the shape of the used patchs for these very bright galaxies depends on the shape of the particular masked galaxy .",
    "once bright galaxies have been masked , the rest of galaxies brighter than the chosen @xmath40 have been masked using circular patches .",
    "the radius of these patches has been chosen to be the same for all galaxies , and its size is again very generous : the adopted patch radius is 15 pixels .    in order to test",
    "if all the residual light beyond the masked regions has been eliminated , the sbf analysis has been repeated for one image varying the radius of the patches .",
    "we have considered patch radii of 20 , 25 and 30 pixels .",
    "note that if a radius larger than 30 pixels would be used , the image would be completely masked due to the superposition of adjacent patches .",
    "the considered image has been the f450w average image of wf2 with @xmath45 .",
    "the sbf results are listed in table [ patches ] .",
    "it can be seen that the sbf results are independent of the patch radius . as a conclusion",
    ", it can be seen that the adopted patch radius avoid residual light beyond the masked regions , as required .",
    "if the differences between the @xcite and @xcite data sets relies on the objects that are merged in the former and not in the latter , as argued by @xcite , then the created window function is virtually the same as one would obtain using the @xcite photometric catalogue , and also masks objects that are in this catalogue and not in that of @xcite .",
    "next , multiplying the window function by the image , the residual masked image is obtained .",
    "it is this image which is used to compute the power spectrum .",
    "as has been said , two sets of masked images have been computed , one for each @xmath46 value .",
    "the power spectrum of the masked image is two - dimensional .",
    "it is radially averaged in order to obtain the one - dimensional power spectrum .",
    "fitting the power spectrum of the images with eq .",
    "[ pow2 ] , the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be obtained for each image . as we could not construct a psf from hdf images , since there were not enough stars in any of the four chips , the used psfs were the high - s / n psfs extracted by p. b. stetson from a large set of uncrowded and unsaturated wfpc2 images .",
    "spatial variations of the psf along the ccd mosaic could introduce a significant uncertainty in @xmath15 . to limit this effect ,",
    "we have used a psf template for each one of the four chips of the wfpc2 .",
    "minor psf variations inside each particular chip have not been considered . for each chip , both psf and",
    "the computed power spectrum represent mean values across the complete field of the chip , so any spatial variation of the psf across the chip would affect the sbf fitting procedure , introducing an uncertainty in the @xmath15 measurement .",
    "this uncertainty is small , and in any case , it is included in the obtained @xmath15 uncertainty .    in fig .",
    "[ @xmath7.average.29 ] we show an example of the sbf fitting procedure in an hdf image .",
    "the observed discrepancy at low wave numbers between the obtained power spectrum and the fit is due to large scale fluctuations in the background brightness of the images .",
    "this wave number region , where the discrepancy occurs , is not taken into account when fitting eq .",
    "the power - spectrum fitting procedure is the following : eq .",
    "[ pow2 ] is used to fit the power spectrum for wave numbers in the range [ @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the highest wave number of the computed power spectrum , and @xmath47 a number which we vary from 0 to @xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "two functions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are obtained .",
    "the function @xmath50 is also shown in fig .",
    "[ @xmath7.average.29 ] ( small boxes ) .",
    "it can be seen that this function exhibits a `` plateau '' region . the final adopted result and its uncertainty for @xmath15",
    "are obtained computing the average and standard deviation of @xmath50 in the plateau interval . for the @xmath16 measurement ,",
    "the procedure is exactly the same as for @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 results corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath52 are listed in tables [ t - results28 ] and [ t - results29 ] , respectively .",
    "results are listed for all images , corresponding to all chips and all filters .",
    "in this section , results from tables [ t - results28 ] and [ t - results29 ] will first be carefully analyzed , and will be used to test the probable effect of flat - fielding errors on the measured @xmath15 .",
    "then , the obtained @xmath15 values in different images will be used to estimate the contribution of cosmic rays and to deduce the desired sbf - measured @xmath41 .",
    "finally , in order to check the sbf results , two consistency tests will be performed .",
    "the possibility of flat - fielding errors affecting the measured @xmath15 must considered .",
    "if flat - fielding would contribute to @xmath15 , then its effect should be larger in images with high sky background . in this context ,",
    "considering same filter and chip images , if flat - fielding is contributing to @xmath15 , a relation between @xmath15 and the sky level should appear .    to test if the flat - fielding errors have an influence on the measured @xmath15 , filter f606w has been considered because it provides a larger number of images covering a wider range of sky levels .",
    "sky levels are provided in the weighted , cosmic - ray cleaned image headers . as an example , fig .",
    "[ flatfielding ] shows the measured @xmath15 as a function of these sky levels for the wf2 f606w images with @xmath45 .",
    "it can be seen that no relation is apparent , so flat - fielding errors are insignificant in the @xmath15 measurements .",
    "the _ hst _ provides images of exceptional resolution . as a consequence , discriminating stars from cosmic rays",
    "is a difficult task .",
    "this also has implications for sbf measurements .",
    "if a cosmic - ray event alters only one pixel , then it is handled as white noise , and consequently , it contributes to the @xmath16 signal .",
    "but if two or more pixels are affected , then a cosmic ray can be confused with a point source and it will therefore contribute to the @xmath15 signal . in the wfpc2 , the majority of cosmic ray events affect 23 pixels , so if undetected cosmic rays exist in an image , the sbf results will be affected by an increase of both @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "but there is noise also due to detected cosmic rays .",
    "the pixels containing cosmic rays have been masked during the data reduction of the images , and therefore , the noise in these pixels is higher than it is in pixels where none of the input images were masked .    as we will see later , the contribution of cosmic rays to @xmath15 is not negligible , and is necessary to control this effect in order to obtain the sbf - measured @xmath41 .",
    "it is for this reason that a strategy aimed at estimating and eliminating the contribution of cosmic rays from @xmath15 must be developed .",
    "such a strategy is described next .    in an individual weighted and cosmic - ray cleaned image , @xmath15 has two contributions , faint galaxies and cosmic rays : @xmath53    if such individual images averaged , the contributions from galaxies and cosmic rays will be different , because of their different natures .",
    "measured in the averaged image , @xmath15 becomes @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of individual images used for the average .    in tables",
    "[ t - results28 ] and [ t - results29 ] , results for @xmath15 are listed for all the individual weighted and cosmic - ray cleaned images and for the averaged images as well .",
    "if the influence of cosmic rays were negligible , @xmath15 would be the same in all the individual images and in the averaged one .",
    "it can be seen that this is not the case , from which we may conclude that the contribution of cosmic rays to @xmath15 is non - negligible .",
    "equations [ cr1 ] and [ cr2 ] can now be used to obtain @xmath41 and @xmath56 . for @xmath15 , the mean of the values of the individual images for each chip and filter have been used .",
    "results are listed in table [ t - results - bg ] for the two considered values of @xmath46 .",
    "the final sbf - measured @xmath41 values for each filter can now be obtained from the averages of the single - chip results .",
    "they are given in the last row of each @xmath46 set in table [ t - results - bg ] and will be compared in  [ discussion ] with the @xmath0-estimated @xmath41 values .",
    "in this section , a couple of consistency tests have been performed in order to check the reliability of our sbf - measured @xmath41 results .",
    "together with the psf - convolved variance , @xmath15 , sbfs provide the value of @xmath16 , the non - psf - convolved variance .",
    "this can be compared with its expected value , directly obtained from the read - out noise , the dark current , and the sky brightness analysis of each image .    for hdf version 2 ,",
    "each of the weighted and cosmic - ray cleaned images is the result of combining several exposures with the same dither position .",
    "the different exposures are combined with weights proportional to the inverse variance ( @xmath57 ) at the mean background level . the variance @xmath16 , in electrons , is computed from the following noise model @xcite :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the exposure time , @xmath60 is the sky background rate , @xmath61 is the dark current , and @xmath62 is the read - out noise .",
    "the inverse variances , @xmath57 , of each exposure are provided in the header of the resulting weighted and cosmic - ray cleaned image . from this information , the value of @xmath16 corresponding to the latter can be computed . as an example , these values are listed in table [ t - p1 ] ( column 2 ) for the wf2 images and @xmath7 . the @xmath16 values obtained directly from the sbf analysis of the images , using @xmath63 , are listed in column 3 . both computed and observed values of @xmath16",

    "only a slight excess in the observed @xmath16 is noticeable .",
    "this excess is produced by cosmic rays , which also contribute to the measured @xmath15 values , as we have shown .",
    "this test shows that , with this technique , the white noise ( @xmath16 ) is determined with high precision , thereby reinforcing the correctness of @xmath15 measurements .",

    "to do this , the magnitude interval [ 27.8 , 28.8 ] has been considered .    as the @xcite photometric catalogue has been used to create the window functions ,",
    "only objects found by them in the magnitude interval [ 27.8 , 28.8 ] contribute to the sbf - measured @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "in particular , some of the objects within the interval [ 27.8 , 28.8 ] in the @xcite catalogue will remain masked , namely those which , following @xcite , are merged in the @xcite catalogue .",
    "this implies that the sbf - measured @xmath64 $ ] is not expected to coincide with the @xmath0-estimated @xmath64 $ ] computed using the @xcite data . on the other hand , the @xmath0-estimated @xmath64 $ ] computed using the @xcite data should , for rigor , be similar to the sbf - measured @xmath64 $ ] only if all the objects of the @xcite catalogue in the interval [ 27.8 , 28.8 ] are unmerged",
    "however , if merged galaxies exist in other intervals @xcite , there is no reason why they should not be present here also .",
    "the effect of mergers on @xmath64 $ ] can be tested considering that a fraction of @xcite objects in the interval [ 27.8 , 28.8 ] are the result of a merger between two fainter galaxies with integrated fluxes @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we have considered three simple situations : i ) @xmath75 ; ii ) @xmath76 ; and iii ) @xmath77 .",

    "it can be seen that , even in the very pessimistic case where @xmath78 of the @xcite objects are mergers of two identical galaxies , their influence on @xmath64 $ ] is less than @xmath12 .",
    "for example , in a perhaps more realistic situation in which about 2025% of the objects are mergers of two galaxies with different magnitudes , the effect on @xmath64 $ ] would smaller than @xmath1410% ( see figure [ mergers ] ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the effect of mergers on @xmath64 $ ] computed using the @xcite number counts is small and can be expected to remain below about 15% for any reasonable scenario .",
