    "dynamics of boolean networks is often used as a model for genetic networks inside cells , in which the genetic states are represented in terms of the language of attractors @xcite .",
    "a boolean network consists of @xmath1 nodes , each of which receives @xmath2 inputs such that the degree is @xmath2 . in the so - called _ kauffman model _  a random boolean network ( rbn ) model , each node receives a certain fixed number of inputs such that the degree is @xmath3 .    however , in real systems each node has a different number of inputs . as a more realistic modeling of biological systems",
    "we expect that the fluctuation of the number of input - degree is treated as a random variable with a probability distribution function such as the inverse power - law distribution or the exponential distribution or the poisson distribution .",
    "in fact , the in - degree distribution appears to be exponential in @xmath4 and to be power - law in yeast @xcite .    in the present report ,",
    "the number of in - degree @xmath2 at the @xmath5th node is determined by the preferential attachment rule @xcite that makes the system a complex network with scale - free topology ( sfrbn ) .",
    "the details of the method for generating the networks have been given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that in the present paper we do not deal with large networks that the difference between the function forms of the distributions becomes clear numerically .",
    "the network size that we deal with is at most @xmath6 , focusing on the intrinsic properties of boolean dynamics in the complex networks .",
    "the initial values for the nodes are chosen randomly and are synchronously updated in the time steps , according to the connectivity @xmath7 and the boolean functions @xmath8 assigned for each node in the network as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the binary state .",
    "all trajectories starting at any initial state run into a certain number of attractors(i.e . points or cycles ) .",
    "we study the directed rbns , the directed sfrbns , and the directed sfrbns throughout this paper .",
    "figure 1 shows the time - dependence of the state which constitutes an typical attractor in the sfrbn with @xmath12 .    .",
    "in the sfrbn with @xmath12 . the vertical axis denotes the node number that is in the high connectivity order .",
    "the dense or gray color corresponds to the binary values of the state .",
    "the static nodes of the attractor are frozen nodes .",
    "the network size is @xmath13 . ]     of state cycles is shown for the rbns and the sfrbns , respectively , where the network size is @xmath14 .",
    "each histogram is generated by @xmath15 different sets of the boolean functions and five different network structures .",
    "the maximum iteration number of the boolean dynamics is @xmath16 until the convergence to the cycle is realized .",
    "( b ) semi - log plots of the median value @xmath17 of 1000 samples of the lengths of the state cycles with respect to the total number @xmath1 of nodes for the directed rbns and sfrbns . ]    fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the histogram of the length @xmath18 of the attractors in the rbn with @xmath19 and that in the sfrbn where the average degree of nodes @xmath20 .",
    "2(b ) shows the median value @xmath17 of the distribution of state cycle lengths with respect to @xmath1 , the total number of nodes .",
    "apparently , the distribution of the attractor lengths in the sfrbn is much wider than that in the rbn , and the attractor length has longer period than that in the rbn .",
    "this is directly related to the diversity of attractors in the sfrbns , which is of great importance for the stability of living cells .",
    "we investigated the function form @xmath21 in more detail in the previous paper @xcite , and found that the function form @xmath21 asymptotically changes from the algebraic type @xmath22 to the exponential one as the average degree @xmath23 goes to @xmath24 .",
    "here we have a question : _ how does the characteristics of the attractors depend on the network topology ? _",
    "in the present paper we study the difference between attractors in the rbn and the sfrbn without a bias , focusing on the frozen nodes and the robustness of attractors against the external perturbations .",
    "in this section , we investigate the so - called frozen nodes of attractors whose values remain constant through a given trajectory of the attractors @xcite .",
    "frozen nodes arise through canalizing the boolean functions and the homogeneity bias .",
    "we count the number of frozen nodes @xmath25 for each attractor and plot the histograms for some cases in fig.3 .",
    "the remarkably different peak structure exists between the cases in the sfrbn of @xmath12 and the rbn of @xmath26 .",
    "the distributions in the sfrbn have a peak around @xmath27 , while the distributions in the rbn are broad with a peak at @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath28 corresponds to the point attractors that all nodes are frozen .     for 1000 attractors in rbns with @xmath26 and sfrbns with @xmath12 .",
    "the network size is ( a)@xmath13 , ( b)@xmath29 and ( c)@xmath14 . the scale out data at @xmath28 are not shown in the figures . ]    the fact that @xmath25 is relatively smaller in the sfrbn would make the attractor period larger than that in the rbn , as seen in fig.2 .",
    "however , role of the frozen nodes is not so clear in the network because all frozen nodes also are connected to the network and might influence on the attractors . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the significance of each node in the respective attractor .",
    "one of the important properties in the scale - free topology is the existence of the highly connected hub node as seen in the yeast synthetic network and so on . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the robustness of attractors to an external perturbation caused by an inversion of the binary state of a single node .",
    "we consider an attractor of period @xmath18 and flip the state of the single node at time @xmath30 $ ] as a perturbation .",
    "the perturbation to the trajectory of the attractor may leap from the trajectory of the original attractor to another one , i.e. the attractor shift .",
    "the high homeostatic stability implies low reachability among different attractors .",
    "we investigate the probability @xmath31 that the attractor remains in the original attractor under the inversion of the single node state @xcite , which is the rate returning to the original attractor under the inversion . here",
    "we call the rate the _ robustness _ of the attractor .     of returning to the original attractor as a function of numbered nodes in the order of the number of in - degree @xmath2 .",
    "we used @xmath29 in both the sfrbn with @xmath12 and the rbn with @xmath26 .",
    "the periods of the attractors are ( a)@xmath32 in the sfrbn and @xmath32 in the rbn , ( b)@xmath33 in the sfrbn and @xmath34 in the rbn , respectively .",
    "the horizontal axis `` node number '' denotes the node number in the order of the number of input - degree . ]",
    "figure 4 shows the robustness @xmath31 of attractors with @xmath33 in the sfrbn and @xmath34 in the rbn , respectively .",
    "it follows that in the sfrbn the number of `` active nodes '' ( @xmath35 ) is much more larger than that in the rbn . on the other hand , in the rbn the perturbation to the active nodes influences effectively the shift of attractor ( @xmath36 ) although the number of active nodes is not so many @xcite . as a result , in the sfrbn",
    "the perturbation to the highly connected hubs may give rise to the attractor shift , comparing with the one to the less connected nodes .",
    "for some attractors of the sfrbn @xmath37 and the rbn with @xmath38 in the network size of @xmath39 .",
    "the periods of attractors are @xmath40 in the sfrbn and @xmath41 in the rbn . ]",
    "the robustness of some attractors in the sfrbn with @xmath42 and in the rbn with @xmath38 is given in fig.5 .",
    "although the whole structure is almost similar to that for the cases in fig .",
    "4 , it is found that the effect of inversion of the single site state on the attractor shift is relatively small compared to the cases of @xmath12 and @xmath26 .",
    "there is a tendency that the attractors become more robust to the perturbation as the average number of input - degree @xmath43 increases .",
    "in summary , we have studied the boolean dynamics of the kauffman model with the directed sfrbn , comparing with the ones with the directed rbn for the relatively small network size . in this study we investigated some intrinsic properties of attractors between the rbns and the sfrbns , focusing on the frozen nodes and the robustness to a perturbation .",
    "the obtained results are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the number of frozen nodes in the sfrbn is smaller than that in the rbn and the property reflects on the much more widely distributed attractor lengths .",
    "\\(ii ) the perturbation to the highly connected hubs may give rise to the attractor shift in comparison to the less connected nodes .",
    "\\(iii ) the attractors becomes more robust to the perturbation as the average number of input degree @xmath43 increases .",
    "although in this report we did not show the details of the attractor shifts by the perturbation , we will present the details of the numerical results for the diagram of transition among the attractors and the robustness to perturbation in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "robustness against genetic mutations and environmental perturbations is one of the universal features of biological systems . and the robustness is important for understanding evolutionary processes and homeostasis of gene regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "however , in this report we investigated only robustness to the single site inversion . for",
    "the purpose of the study , the other robustness of the sfrbn might become significant ; for instance , robustness of attractors to the change of boolean functions and to the breakdown of the network structures .",
    "we expect that such a study on the robustness of attractors provide some insights into important biological phenomena such as cellular homeostasis and apotosis .",
    "actually aldana _ et al _ investigated the small sfrbn ( @xmath44 ) and found that the robustness of the ordered phase to the network damage is lower than that in the rbn @xcite the result implies that there exists a possibility of evolution though mutation even in the ordered phase , despite of the kauffman s conjecture that life evolves in `` edge of chaos '' .",
    "moreover , recently , an interesting network model , the so called _ feedback network _ has been proposed by white _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the feedback networks can be a good model for describing the autocatalytic chemical reactions and the kinship , and so on , because the node selection , the search distance and the search path of networks are controlled by the attachment , the distance decay and the cycle formation parameters .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the features of the boolean dynamics in the feedback networks from the point of view of frozen nodes and robustness @xcite .",
