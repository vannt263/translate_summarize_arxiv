    "one of the main observational results stemming from five years of @xmath7-ray burst ( grb ) follow - ups at optical wavelengths is that about @xmath8 of well - localized grbs lack a detected optical afterglow , ( `` dark bursts '' ; taylor et al .",
    "2000 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2001 ; reichart & yost 2001 ; lazzati , covino , & ghisellini 2002 ) . in some cases",
    ", a non - detection of the optical afterglow could simply be due to a failure to image quickly and/or deeply enough .",
    "however , there are two grbs for which there is strong evidence that the optical emission should have been detected , based on an extrapolation of the radio and x - ray emission ( djorgovski et al . 2001a ; piro et al . 2002 ) .",
    "one interpretation in these two cases is that the optical light was extinguished by dust , either within the immediate environment of the burst or elsewhere along the line of sight ( e.g.  groot et al . 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is a high redshift , leading to absorption of the optical light in the ly@xmath9 forest .",
    "however , the redshifts of the underlying host galaxies of these grbs are of order unity ( djorgovski et al . 2001a ; piro et al . 2002 ) .",
    "several authors have recently argued that a large fraction of the dark bursts are due to dust extinction within the local environment of the bursts ( e.g.  reichart & yost 2001 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ; reichart & price 2002 ) , but other scenarios have also been suggested ( e.g.  lazzati et al . 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , it has been noted that regardless of the location of extinction within the host galaxy , the fraction of dark bursts is a useful upper limit on the fraction of obscured star formation ( kulkarni et al .",
    "2000 ; djorgovski et al . 2001b",
    "; ramirez - ruiz , trentham , & blain 2002 ; reichart & price 2002 ) .",
    "however , from an observational point of view , we must have a clear understanding of the diversity of afterglow properties before extracting astrophysically interesting inferences from dark bursts .",
    "for example , afterglows which are faint or fade rapidly ( relative to the detected population ) would certainly bias the determination of the fraction of truly obscured bursts . in this vein , fynbo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , noting the faint optical afterglow of grb000630 , argued that some dark bursts are due to a failure to image deeply and/or quickly enough , rather than dust extinction .    here",
    "we present optical and radio observations of , an afterglow that would have been classified dark had it not been for rapid and deep searches .",
    "furthermore , is an example of an afterglow , which is dim due to the combination of intrinsic faintness and a relatively fast decline , and not strong extinction .",

    "eight minutes after receiving the coordinates we observed the error box with the dual - band ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) macho imager mounted on the robotic 50-in telescope at the mount stromlo observatory ( mso ) .",
    "we also observed the error box with the wide - field imager on the 40-in telescope at siding spring observatory ( sso ) .",
    "we were unable to identify a transient source within the large error box ( price , schmidt , & axelrod 2002 ) .",
    "we subsequently observed the error box refined by the inter - planetary network ( hurley et al .",
    "2002 ) with the palomar 48-in oschin schmidt using the unfiltered neat imager .",
    "psf - matched image subtraction ( alard 2000 ) between the macho and neat images revealed a fading source ( price et al .",
    "2002 ) , which was @xmath16 mag at the epoch of our first observations , and not present in the digitized sky survey .",
    "two nights later we observed the afterglow using the jacobs camera ( jcam ; bloom et al .",
    "2002b ) mounted at the east arm focus of the palomar 200-in telescope ( bloom et al .",

    "given the positional coincidence between the fading optical source and radio detection we suggest this source to be the afterglow of .",
    "the optical images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded in the standard manner . to extract the photometry we weighted the aperture with a gaussian equivalent to the seeing disk ( `` weighted - aperture photometry '' ) , using iraf / wphot .",

    "the rms of the resultant mapping is 133 mas ( ra ) and 124 mas ( dec ) . using this mapping and iraf / geoxytrans we transfered the afterglow position on the jcam image to the hst images .",
    "the rms of the transformation is 604 mas ( ra ) and 596 mas ( dec ) , and is dominated by the uncertainty in the jcam position .    the source `` s1 '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hst ] ) coincides with the afterglow position within the astrometric uncertainty .",
    "we performed differential photometry at the position of s1 by registering the images of epochs 1 and 2 using a cross - correlation of a field of size 10 arcsec centered on s1 ( using iraf / crosscor and shiftfind ) .",
    "we used iraf / center and the fwhm of a relatively bright point source ( `` psf star '' ; fig .  [ fig : field ] ) to fix the position of s1 in each of the final images , and to determine the uncertainty in the position .",

    "we get @xmath42 .    to account for the steepening we modify the model for the @xmath32-band lightcurve to : @xmath43^{1/n } , \\label{eqn : model2}\\ ] ] where , @xmath44 is the asymptotic index for @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the asymptotic index for @xmath47 , @xmath48 provides a smooth joining of the two asymptotic segments , and @xmath49 is the time at which the asymptotic segments intersect .",
    "we retain the simple model for the @xmath15 and @xmath14 lightcurves since they are restricted to @xmath50 days ( i.e.  well before the observed steepening ) .",
    "we investigate two alternatives for the observed steepening in the framework of the afterglow synchrotron model ( e.g.  sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) . in this framework , @xmath44 , @xmath46 , and @xmath51",
    "are related to each other through the index ( @xmath52 ) of the electron energy distribution , @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) .",
    "the relations for the models discussed below , as well as the resulting closure relations , @xmath55 , are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : models ] .",
    "the observed steepening , @xmath56 , can be due to the passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency , @xmath57 , through the @xmath32-band .",
    "this has been inferred , for example , in the afterglow of grb971214 , at @xmath58 days ( wijers & galama 1999 ) .",
    "if the steepening is due to @xmath57 , this rules out models in which the ejecta expand into a circumburst medium with @xmath59 ( hereafter , wind ) , because in this model @xmath57 increases with time ( @xmath60 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) , and one expects @xmath61 .",
    "there are two remaining models to consider in this case : ( i ) spherical expansion into a circumburst medium with constant density ( hereafter , @xmath62 ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) , and ( ii ) a jet with @xmath63 ( i.e.  a jet break prior to the first observation at @xmath64 days ; hereafter , @xmath65 ) .",
    "the subscript b indicates that @xmath57 is blueward of the optical bands initially . in both models we use eqn .",
    "[ eqn : model2 ] for the @xmath32-band lightcurve , with @xmath49 defined as the time at which @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we find that in the @xmath62 model @xmath68 days , while in the @xmath65 model @xmath69 days .",
    "moreover , in both models the closure relations can only be satisfied by including a contribution from dust extinction within the host galaxy , @xmath70 .",
    "we estimate the required extinction using the parametric extinction curves of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) and fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) , along with the interpolation calculated by reichart ( 2001 ) .",
    "since the redshift of is not known we assume @xmath71 , which spans the range of typical redshifts for the long - duration grbs .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath72 are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : models ] , and range from 0.2 to 0.9 mag .",
    "an alternative explanation for the steepening is a jet expanding into : ( i ) an ism medium with @xmath57 blueward of the optical bands ( j-@xmath73 ) , ( ii ) a wind medium with @xmath57 blueward of the optical bands ( j-@xmath74 ) , and ( iii ) an ism or wind medium with @xmath57 redward of the optical bands ( j-@xmath75 ) .",
    "we note that the j-@xmath62 model is different than the @xmath62 model (  [ sec : cooling ] ) since previously it was defined such that the jet break is later than the last observation . in these models",
    ", @xmath76 is the time at which @xmath77 .    from the closure values we note that the j-@xmath75 requires no extinction within the host galaxy , while the j-@xmath62 and j-@xmath74 models require values of about @xmath78 to @xmath79 mag .",
    "we find @xmath80 days , corresponding to @xmath81 .",
    "using the measured fluence (  [ sec : opt ] ) we estimate the beaming - corrected @xmath7-ray energy , @xmath82 erg , assuming a circumburst density of 1 @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 is a weak function of @xmath86 ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the distribution of @xmath85 for long - duration grbs ( frail et al .",
    "regardless of the specific model for the afterglow emission , the main conclusion of  [ sec : model ] is that the optical afterglow of suffered little or no dust extinction .",
    "still , this afterglow would have been missed by typical searches undertaken even as early as 12 hours after the grb event . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlims ] , about @xmath87 of the searches conducted to date would have failed to detect an optical afterglow like that of .",
    "this is simply because the afterglow of was faint and exhibited relatively rapid decay . from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_f0 ] we note that is one of the faintest afterglows detected to date ( normalized to @xmath40 day ) , and while it is not an excessively rapid fader , it is in the top @xmath88 in this category .    thus , the afterglow of , along with that of grb000630 ( fynbo et al . 2001 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_f0 ] ) , indicates that there is a wide diversity in the brightness and decay rates of optical afterglows .",
    "in fact , the brightness distribution spans a factor of about 400 , while the decay index varies by more than a factor of three .",
    "coupled with the low dust extinction in the afterglow of , this indicates that some dark bursts may simply be dim , and not dust obscured .",
    "given this wide diversity in the brightness of optical afterglows , it is important to establish directly that an afterglow is dust obscured .",
    "this has only been done in a few cases (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "therefore , while _ statistical _ analyses ( e.g.  reichart & yost 2001 ) point to extinction as the underlying reason for some fraction of dark bursts , and may even account for an afterglow like that of , it is clear that observationally the issue of dark bursts is not settled , and the observational biases have not been traced fully .    since progress in our understanding of dark bursts will benefit from observations , we need consistent , rapid follow - up of a large number of bursts to constrain the underlying distribution , as well as complementary techniques which can directly measure material along the line of sight .",
    "this includes x - ray observations which allow us to measure the column density to the burst ( galama & wijers 2001 ) , and thus infer the type of environment , and potential extinction level . along the same line , radio observations allow us to infer the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , which is sensitive to the ambient density ( e.g.  sari & esin 2001 ) ; the detection of radio emission , as in the case of , implies a density @xmath89 @xmath83 .",
    "finally , prompt optical observations , as we have carried out in this case , may uncover a larger fraction of the dim optical afterglows , and provide a better constraint on the fraction of truly obscured bursts .",
