    "the influence of aperiodic ( dis-)order on the thermodynamic properties and the critical behaviour of spin systems has been an active research area , particularly since the discovery of quasicrystals in 1984 . in view of the many articles existing",
    ", we can not give proper credit to all contributors ; instead , we would like to refer the reader to a recent review @xcite which contains a rather complete bibliography on this subject .",
    "for ferromagnetic ising systems , heuristic scaling arguments , put forward by luck @xcite , lead to qualitative predictions on the relevance of disorder implemented through an aperiodic variation of the coupling constants which go beyond the original relevance - irrelevance criterion of harris @xcite .",
    "for the ising quantum chain ( iqc ) , or the equivalent 2@xmath2 classical ising model @xcite with layered disorder , this relevance criterion reads as follows : the critical behaviour is of onsager - type as long as the fluctuations in the sequence of coupling constants are bounded , whereas for unbounded fluctuations the critical singularities resemble those of the randomly disordered case .",
    "this behaviour had first been conjectured by tracy @xcite on ths basis of his results for two different examples of three - letter substitution rules .",
    "of particular interest is the marginal case with logarithmically ( in the system size ) diverging fluctuations . here ,",
    "the critical exponents are predicted to depend continuously on the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , some exact results were obtained for substitution chains with marginal fluctuations of the couplings . for a number of substitution chains ,",
    "the surface magnetisation critical exponent could be calculated @xcite ; and , recently , the correlation length critical exponent was derived for two special substitution rules using an exact renormalisation approach @xcite .",
    "all these results are in accordance with luck s predictions .",
    "the real space renormalisation method we use in this article is based on the decimation process introduced in ref .",
    "our setup is quite different , though ; and in particular we are going to show how _ arbitrary _ substitution rules can be analysed in terms of @xmath3-matrices and their star - product formalism . in this way , the dependence of the critical behaviour on the nature of the fluctuations can be derived explicitly .",
    "the analysis is carried out in detail for two - letter substitution chains , with the result that luck s relevance criterion emerges from the renormalisation relations in a natural way .",
    "an extended renormalisation scheme for the most general case of @xmath4-letter substitution rules is presented in an appendix and discussed for certain examples . for infinite classes of substitution chains with marginal fluctuations , including the two - letter chains , an analytic expression for the correlation length critical exponent",
    "is given .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in sec .  2 , we give a brief outline of the model , including some introductory remarks on substitution rules and on properties of the corresponding substitution sequences .",
    "then , in sec .  3",
    ", we introduce the renormalisation transformation for a restricted class of @xmath4-letter substitution chains , comprising all two - letter substitution chains .",
    "the dependence of the renormalisation flow on the fluctuations of the couplings is shown and the consequences are discussed in detail . subsequently , in sec .  4 , we summarise the implications of our results for the critical properties of the iqc for the three different types of fluctuations in the sequence of the coupling constants . our conclusions and an outlook on future developments are presented in sec .",
    "the paper contains two appendices related to the content of sec .  3 :",
    "in appendix  a , the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the case of a two - letter substitution sequence is derived ; and finally , generalising the discussion of sec .  3 , the renormalisation transformation for arbitrary @xmath4-letter substitution rules is explained in appendix  b.",
    "the iqc in a transverse magnetic field is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 acting on the tensor - product space @xmath6 . here ,",
    "the @xmath7 denote the transverse fields at the sites .",
    "the @xmath8 are site - dependent coupling constants , and the operators @xmath9 denote pauli s matrices acting on the @xmath10th site . in what follows ,",
    "we consider closed chains with _ periodic _ boundary conditions which are defined by @xmath11 ; various other kinds of boundary conditions can be chosen without changing the key results .    for a general set of coupling constants @xmath8 and fields @xmath7 ,",
    "the iqc can be written as a free - fermion model via a jordan - wigner transformation and can then be diagonalised by a bogoljubov - valatin transformation , resulting in @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are @xmath15 fermionic creation and annihilation operators and @xmath16 is some constant .",
    "the dimensionless excitation energies @xmath17 ( which can be chosen to be positive and ordered , i.e. , @xmath18 , while properly adjusting the constant @xmath16 ) satisfy the linear difference equations @xmath19 normally , one proceeds by eliminating either @xmath20 or @xmath21 . in this way",
    ", the problem of diagonalising the @xmath22 matrix @xmath23 can be reduced to the diagonalisation of an @xmath24 matrix . from the set of @xmath15 eigenvalues ( fermion frequencies ) @xmath25 of the latter ,",
    "the total spectrum of the complete hamiltonian @xmath23 is recovered by considering the sums of the elements of any of its @xmath26 subsets .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions , the situation is in fact a little more complicated ; in order to avoid the appearance of a non - local number operator in the fermionic hamiltonian one has to consider so - called _ mixed sector _ hamiltonians .",
    "these are obtained by combining the _ even _ sector ( with respect to the operator @xmath27 that commutes with @xmath28 ) of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : qc ] ) with _ periodic _ boundary conditions with the _ odd _ sector of the same hamiltonian with _ antiperiodic _ boundary conditions ( defined by @xmath29 ) , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the iqc is equivalent to the 2@xmath2 classical ising model with a layered modulation of the interactions @xcite .",
    "the correspondence shows up through an extremely anisotropic limit ( also called the @xmath30-continuum limit @xcite ) of the coupling constants of the latter , which is believed not to alter the critical behaviour .",
    "explicitly , one establishes the following relations : the _ temperature _ @xmath31 of the classical model corresponds to the _ transverse field _",
    "@xmath32 of the quantum chain , the _ free energy",
    "_ translates into the _ ground - state energy _ and the counterpart of the _ correlation length @xmath33 parallel _ to the layers is the _ inverse mass gap _",
    "@xmath34 of the iqc . in our setting ,",
    "the mass gap is just given by the modulus of the smallest fermionic excitation @xmath35 of ( [ ffh ] ) . according to finite - size scaling",
    ", we thus expect a scaling behaviour of @xmath35 at the critical point as @xmath36 provided the correlation length scales with a power law at all .",
    "hereby , the scaling exponent @xmath37 translates into the correlation length critical exponent @xmath38 parallel to the layers in terminology of the 2@xmath2 statistical system , while @xmath39 retains its unperturbed onsager value @xmath40 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : qc ] ) is _ critical _ ( in the sense that the energy gap in the excitation spectrum vanishes , i.e. , @xmath41 ) in the thermodynamic limit if the _ geometric mean _ ( rather than the arithmetic mean ) of the couplings , normalised by the variables of the transverse field , is equal to one , i.e. , @xmath42 compare ref .",
    "the repetitive structure of the substitution sequences we are going to consider guarantees that the mean is well - defined @xcite .",
    "let us now assume that the coupling constants @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are chosen from a set of @xmath4 possible values @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , the value @xmath45 occuring with a frequency @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the field to be constant , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "then , condition ( [ eq : critcond ] ) can be fulfilled by choosing @xmath4 positive real numbers @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and setting the couplings to @xmath52 where @xmath53 . unless stated otherwise , this parametrisation of the critical surface will be used in the sequel .",
    "let us now consider coupling constants @xmath8 drawn from a set of values @xmath54 , where the label @xmath55 runs over the letters of a ( finite ) @xmath4-letter alphabet @xmath56 .",
    "we choose the couplings @xmath8 according to sequences generated by iterated application of a substitution rule @xmath57 on @xmath56 . for the introduction of the concept and some notation , consider a simple example on a two - letter alphabet @xmath58 : @xmath59 we start with an initial word , e.g. @xmath60 , and define @xmath61 .",

    "the entries of the , statistically normalised , ( right ) eigenvector @xmath68 , corresponding to the perron - frobenius eigenvalue @xmath69 , give the frequencies of the letters in the limit word @xmath70 . in order to ensure that , starting from any seed , the letter frequencies converge to unique , positive values in the limit chain , we restrict ourselves to _ primitive _ substitution rules @xmath71 throughout this paper .",
    "for the corresponding substitution matrices @xmath72 , this means that the entries of @xmath73 are _ strictly positive _ for any integer @xmath74 ( and a suitably chosen finite @xmath75 ) .",
    "this is obviously true for the examples ( [ eq : sub ] ) .",
    "associated to a word @xmath76 of length ( i.e. , number of letters ) @xmath77 , one obtains finite ( closed ) quantum chains with @xmath15 sites by setting @xmath78 whenever the @xmath10th letter of the word @xmath76 is an @xmath63 , and @xmath79 otherwise , the final letter of @xmath76 determining the coupling between the last and the first spin in the chain . while @xmath80 , the largest eigenvalue of the substitution matrix , describes the asymptotic scaling of the chain length with the number of iterations @xmath81 , @xmath82 , the _ fluctuation _ behaviour of the exchange couplings is connected to the second - largest eigenvalue @xmath83 ( where it is the _ modulus _ of the eigenvalue that matters , hence by `` second - largest eigenvalue '' we always refer to the eigenvalue with the second - largest absolute value ) . in order to quantify the fluctuations ,",
    "let us define @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the average coupling in the limit chain .",
    "fluctuations stay _ bounded _ as long as @xmath86 , but for @xmath87 they grow with iterated substitutions as a power of the chain length , @xmath88 , governed by the so - called _ wandering exponent _",

    "generically , however , finite fluctuations within the substitutes @xmath93 of the letters @xmath94 will increase the total fluctuation in the vicinity of these points by a certain amount @xmath95 : @xmath96 for some word @xmath97 with @xmath98 and fixed @xmath99 . by repeated use of this argument",
    ", we thus expect fluctuations that _ diverge logarithmically _ with the length of the chain ( since the length grows exponentially with the number of iterations ) , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the same argument also shows that , in this case , the fluctuation behaviour is not completely determined by the _ substitution matrix _ , but may also depend on the details of the actual _ substitution rule _",
    "@xcite ; and for special choices the fluctuations may still stay bounded even though the second - largest eigenvalue is @xmath91 .",
    "coming back to our examples ( [ eq : sub ] ) , let us concentrate on the three cases @xmath100 ( which yields the famous _ fibonacci sequence _ ) , @xmath101 ( the _ period - doubling sequence _ ) , and @xmath102 ( the _ binary non - pisot sequence _ ) .",
    "as the second - largest eigenvalues of the substitution matrices @xmath62 fulfill @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , this includes an example of bounded fluctuations ( @xmath100 ) , a marginal case with logarithmically divergent fluctuations ( @xmath101 ) and an example of strong fluctuations ( @xmath102 ) , hence all three interesting cases are illustrated @xcite .",
    "another substitution chain that is referred to several times in the text is the celebrated _ thue - morse sequence _ @xmath106",

    ", one can not possibly expect analytical results for an arbitrary sequence of couplings .",
    "however , for _ substitution _ sequences , more can be said using an exact renormalisation scheme , and , for an interesting class of chains with marginal fluctuations , the scaling exponent @xmath37 ( [ eq : scal ] ) can be determined exactly and given in a closed form .",

    "the interaction along it ) is a function of its two endpoints @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the couplings here are still attached to the bonds . * in the renormalisation formalism , now define @xmath3-matrices , fields and asymmetry - parameters corresponding to pairs of letters @xmath415 renormalisation again means inverting the substitution process by integrating out all degrees of freedom attached to the words @xmath409 and @xmath410 .",
    "we obtain renormalised @xmath3-matrices through @xmath416 * the rt ( and their linear orders in @xmath126 ) for the ( at most ) @xmath417 parameters are then obtained analogous to section  3 .    for a classification of the critical behaviour based on the fluctuations we need to know about the spectrum @xmath418 of @xmath414 in dependence of the spectrum @xmath419 of @xmath72 . for an appropriate power of @xmath71 , it is indeed possible to show that @xmath418 contains @xmath419 and that all additional eigenvalues are either 1 or 0 .",
    "we only sketch the proof here . without restriction of the general case",
    ", we can assume that the first and the last letters of all words @xmath114 remain fixed under the substitution ; that is @xmath420 ^ 1 $ ] for the first letter , and equivalently for the last letter .",
    "this is always fulfilled by a finite power @xmath421 of the substitution rule .",
    "we assume the @xmath4 words @xmath114 to have @xmath134 different first letters and @xmath10 different last letters . taking a look at the associated pair substitution matrix @xmath414 ,",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath422 since we always have @xmath423 and the numbers @xmath134 and @xmath10 remain fixed because of the above assumption , the traces of @xmath424 and @xmath425 differ only by the constant @xmath426 for arbitrary @xmath81 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath418 containes @xmath419 and the all additional eigenvalues are fixed points under any power , thus @xmath285 or @xmath286 .",
    "we will , however , not give a detailed discussion of the general case here , but rather illustrate the method by applying it to a special example .",
    "consider the substitution rule of the `` circle sequence '' .",
    "this example of a quasiperiodic chain ( in the sense that it has a pure point fourier spectrum ) has been studied numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath427 with @xmath252 being of the form ( [ subs3 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath428 are @xmath429 , @xmath285 , and @xmath430 , where @xmath431 is the golden mean ",
    "we thus expect marginal fluctuations . the asymptotic frequencies of the letters are @xmath432 , @xmath433 , and @xmath434 , respectively . we choose @xmath435 , @xmath436 , and @xmath437 as the parametrisation of the critical couplings @xmath438 .",
    "since only the five pairs @xmath258 , @xmath439 , @xmath440 , @xmath441 , and @xmath442 appear in the chain , the dimension of the pair transfer matrix @xmath443 is just five .",
    "the spectrum @xmath444 consists of the spectrum @xmath445 and of two additional eigenvalues 1 . identifying pairs of couplings with the first one , we clearly have @xmath446 , @xmath447 , and @xmath448 .",
    "thus the vector of the logarithms of the reduced couplings , @xmath449 , is sill perpendicular to the perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath414 and converges in the renormalisation limit to a linear combination of two eigenvectors corresponding to an eigenvalue 1 of @xmath450 : @xmath451 .",
    "while both parameters , @xmath253 and @xmath452 , enter the transformation matrices @xmath171 of @xmath172 , @xmath452 can actually be eliminated by a similarity transformation .",
    "such a behaviour is always to be expected if a parameter is connected to an eigenvector ( like in this case ) that corresponds to an _ additional _ eigenvalue 1 of @xmath453 , not contained in @xmath445 .",
    "the perron - frobenius eigenvalues of @xmath171 can be determined explicitly , and we obtain for the scaling exponent @xmath454 finally , we like to show an example of a three - letter substitution rule @xmath455 with bounded fluctuations , which nevertheless has @xmath236 as the second - largest eigenvalue of the substitution matrix .",
    "this is the bond substitution that corresponds to the site - problem given by @xmath456 .",
    "fluctuations are indeed bounded here , since we just obtain the fibonacci chain by identifying @xmath63 and @xmath64 , but also by identifying @xmath63 and @xmath310 . calculating the scaling exponent by the above method , we obtain @xmath273 , as was to be expected .    99 h.  au - yang and b.m .",
