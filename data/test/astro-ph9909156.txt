    "the principal assumptions of the _ standard _ cdm ( scdm ) model ( see also liddle & lyth 1993 ) are :    * a flat universe dominated by weakly interacting elementary particles having low velocity dispersion at early times . the barionic content is determined by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis model ( kernan & sarkar 1996 ; steigman 1996 ; olive 1997 ; dolgov 1997 ) ; * critical matter density ; * expansion rate given by @xmath0 ; * a scale invariant and adiabatic spectrum with a spectral index , @xmath1 ; * the condition required by observations , that the fluctuations in galaxy distribution , @xmath2 , are larger than the fluctuations in the mass distribution , @xmath3 by a factor @xmath4 .    if this last assumption is not introduced , the pairwise velocity dispersion is larger then that deduced from observations and the galaxy correlation function is steeper than that observed ( davis et al .",
    "after the great success of the model in the 80 s , a closer inspection of the model has shown a series of deficiencies , namely :    * the strong clustering of rich clusters of galaxies , @xmath5 , far in excess of cdm predictions ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) ; * the overproduction of clusters abundance .",
    "clusters abundance is a useful test for models of galaxy formation .",
    "this is connected to three relevant parameters : the mass function , the vdf and the temperature function .",

    "one of the most important constraints that a model for large - scale structure must overcome is that of predicting the correct number density of clusters of galaxies .",
    "this constraint is crucial for several reasons . according to the gravitational instability scenario , galaxies and clusters form where the density contrast , @xmath24 , is large enough so that the surrounding matter can separate from the general expansion and collapse .",
    "consequently the abundance of collapsed objects depends on the amplitude of the density perturbations . in the cdm model",
    "these latter follow a gaussian probability distribution and their amplitude on a scale @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 , the r.m.s .",
    "value of @xmath24 , which is related to the power spectrum , @xmath27 . in hierarchical models of structure formation , like cdm",
    ", @xmath26 decreases with increasing scale , @xmath25 , and consequently the density contrast required to form large objects , like clusters of galaxies , rarely occurs .",
    "the present abundance of clusters is then extremely sensitive to a small change in the spectrum , @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the rate of clusters evolution is strictly connected to the density parameter , @xmath28 .",
    "then , clusters abundance and its evolution are a probe of @xmath28 and @xmath27 and can be used to put some constraints on them .",
    "+ the abundance of clusters of galaxies , together with the mass distributions in galaxy halos and in rich clusters of galaxies , the peculiar motions of galaxies , the spatial structure of the microwave background radiation is one of the most readily accessible observables which probes the mass distribution directly .",
    "the most accurate way of assessing the cluster abundance is via numerical simulations .",
    "however , there is an excellent analytic alternative , press & schechter s theory ( press & schechter 1974 ; bond et al .",
    "brainerd & villumsen ( 1992 ) studied the cdm halo mass function using a hierarchical particle mesh code . from this last work it results that the press & schechter formula fits the results of the simulation up to a mass of  10 times the characteristic 1@xmath29 fluctuation mass , @xmath30 , being @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the bias parameter and @xmath33 is the local slope of the power spectrum . for the case of critical - density universes , n - body simulations ( lacey & cole 1994 )",
    "have been shown to be in extremely well agreement with press & schecter s theory .",
    "+ press - schechter s theory states that the fraction of mass in gravitationally bound systems larger than a mass , @xmath34 , is given by the fraction of space in which the linearly evolved density field , smoothed on the mass scale @xmath34 , exceeds a threshold @xmath35 : @xmath36 the fraction of the mass density in non - linear objects of mass m to m+d m is given by differentiating eq .",

    "( 1994 ) and bartlett & silk ( 1993 ) to calculate the mass function and the x - ray temperature function of clusters , respectively .",
    "the spectrum is lower by @xmath54 on cluster mass scales than holtzman s ( 1989 ) .",
    "the spectrum was normalized to the cobe quadrupole @xmath55 k , corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "as shown by bartlett & silk ( 1993 ) the x - ray distribution function , obtained using a standard cdm spectrum , over - produces the clusters abundances data obtained by henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) and by edge et al .",
    "this has lead some authors ( white et al .",
    "1993b ) to cite the cluster abundance as one of the strongest pieces of evidence against the standard cdm model when the model is normalized so as to reproduce the microwave background anisotropies as seen by the cobe satellite ( bennett et al . 1996",
    "; banday et al . 1996 ; grsky et al . 1996 ; hinshaw et al .",
    "+ the discrepancy can be reduced taking into account the non - radial motions that originate when a cluster reaches the non - linear regime as follows . a fundamental role in press - schechter s theory",

    "the situation is more complicated . considering the collapse along all the three axes the threshold is higher , whereas the collapse along the first axis ( pancake formation ) or the first two axes ( filament formation ) corresponds to a lower threshold ( monaco 1995 ) .",

    "the result is in agreement with the study of the mass function in the scdm model by jing & fang ( 1994 ) and by bahcall & cen ( 1992a , b ) .",
    "even with a lower normalization , cdm can not reproduce the cluster abundance as stressed by bartlett & silk ( 1993 ) , on the contrary a reduction of normalization produces a too steep mass function ( bahcall & cen 1992b ; bartlett 1997 ) .",
    "the introduction of non - radial motions ( solid line ) reduces remarkably the abundance of clusters with the result that the model predictions are in good agreement with the observational data .",
    "this result confirms what found in del popolo & gambera ( 1999 ) showing how a mass dependent threshold , @xmath82 , ( dependence caused by the developing of non - radial motions ) can solve several of scdm discrepancies with observations .",

    "( [ eq : tt ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ev ] ) it should be necessary to convolve @xmath113 with a gaussian having dispersion of @xmath114 ( see lilje 1990 ) .",
    "the result of this operation is that the abundance of clusters with high velocity dispersion depends on the assumed value of the rms scatter : a larger scatter implies a larger @xmath113 .",
    "the result of this effect is the worsening of the problem of clusters abundance over - production in the cdm model without non - radial motions .",
    "most clusters , like elliptical galaxies , are not spherical and their shape is not due to rotation ( rood et al . 1972 ; gregory & tifft 1976 ; dressler 1981 ) .",
    "the perturbations that gave rise to the formation of clusters of galaxies are alike to have been initially aspherical ( barrow & silk 1981 ; peacock & heavens 1985 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) and asphericities are then amplified during gravitational collapse ( lin et al . 1965 ; icke 1973 ; barrow & silk 1981 ) .",
    "the elongations are probably due to a velocity anisotropy of the galaxies ( aarseth & binney 1978 ) and according to binney & silk ( 1979 ) and to salvador - sol & solanes ( 1993 ) the elongation of clusters originates in the tidal distortion by neighboring protoclusters .",
    "in particular salvador - sol & solanes ( 1993 ) found that the main distorsion on a cluster is produced by the nearest neighboring cluster having more than 45 galaxies and the same model can explain the alignement between neighboring clusters ( binggeli 1982 ; oort 1983 ; rhee & katgert 1987 ; plionis 1993 ) and that between clusters and their first ranked galaxy ( carter & metcalfe 1980 ; dressler 1981 ; binggeli 1982 ; rhee & katgert 1987 ; tucker & peterson 1988 ; van kampen & rhee 1990 ; lambas et al .",
    "1990 ; west 1994 ) . clusters elongations and alignement could be also explained by means of zeldovich s ( 1978 ) `` pancakes '' theory of cluster formation but this top - down formation model is probably ruled out for several well known reasons ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "+ the observational information on the distribution of clusters shapes is sometimes conflicting .",
    "rhee et al .",

    "they showed that tidal interactions between protoclusters and the neighbouring protostructures should yield prolate shapes ( before virialization ) with an axial ratio of protostructures of @xmath121 , the typical value found in clusters .",
    "after virialization the pre - existing elongation is damped and the axial ratio leads to values of about @xmath122 , that are higher with respect to observations . as observed by salvador - sol & solanes ( 1993 ) this last discrepancy can be removed taking into account that tidal interaction keeps going on after virialization and that on average the damping of elongations due to violent relaxation is eliminated by its growth after virialization .",
    "then this growth restores a value of @xmath123 near the one that clusters had before virialization . +    according to the quoted binney & silk ( 1979 ) model ,",
    "an initially spherical protostructure ( e.g. a protocluster ) of mass @xmath34 having at distance @xmath124 from its centre a series of similar protostructure of mass @xmath125 shall be distorted . in order to calculate the distortion we must write the equation of motion of a particle at position @xmath126 relative to the centre of m ( assumed as origin of coordinates ) .",
    "supposing that the effective perturbing mass is less by a factor @xmath127 than its true mass m , in the limit @xmath128 we have : @xmath129 if the tidal interaction is treated as first order , writing @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , it is possible to show that the component of @xmath133 parallel to @xmath134 is : @xmath135 g(x , x_1)\\ ] ] where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the value of @xmath138 at which the perturbation was switched on . the term in square parentheses reduces to @xmath139 , if @xmath134 is parallel or antiparallel to @xmath140 , and to -@xmath141 when they are orthogonal .",

    "as shown @xmath123 declines with mass in agreement with the above quoted point a ) : richer clusters are more spherical than poorer clusters .",
    "the physical reason for this may be that regions of higher density turn around earlier from hubble flow than lower density regions ( de theije et al .",

    "the vdf , calculated similarly to the mass function , was compared with the cfa data by zabloudoff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and those of mazure et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and fadda et al .",
    "taking account of non - radial motions we obtained a notheworthy reduction of the discrepancies between the cdm predicted mass function , the vdf and the observations .",
    "non - radial motions are also able to change the shape of clusters of galaxies reducing their elongations with respect to the prediction of the scdm model .",
    "this last result is in agreement with recent studies of the shapes of clusters by de theije et al .",
