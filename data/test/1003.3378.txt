    "quantum dots ( qds ) have played a prominent role in the investigation of the kondo problem physics in recent years , @xcite as they allow a systematic and well - controlled variation of structure parameters , with the consequent exploration of electronic correlations in this paramount many - body state .",
    "this exploration is of course possible by being able to experimentally tune the relevant parameters in the system over rather wide ranges .",
    "moreover , in a feature that is unique to these systems , qds also facilitate the incorporation and study of quantum coherence effects in the kondo state , and its interplay with structure resonances and field - induced phase shifts .",
    "in fact , the kondo effect has been studied in multi - quantum dot systems , including double,@xcite and triple dots , @xcite in different geometrical arrangements , motivated in part by the richness of the kondo physics in the presence of localized levels , as well as by their potential application as spin filters .",
    "one of the main signatures of the kondo state is the enhancement of the quasi - particle density of states at the fermi level ; this kondo resonance is accessible in electronic transport experiments , as it opens an additional transport channel , which is readily seen in the differential conductance of these structures ( typically in the zero - bias limit ) . in the case of multiple qd geometries , the kondo and other single - particle  like resonances provide different transport channels which can even interfere with one another . as a result ,",
    "these structures offer the interesting possibility of controlling the transport properties by exploiting quantum interference in the electronic propagation , allowing the study of scattering phenomena such as the well - known fano @xcite and aharonov - bohm effects,@xcite competing with the kondo effect .",
    "for example , the interference of kondo and fano resonances in suitably designed structures has been shown recently in beautiful experiments , giving rise to complex conductance features.@xcite these results demonstrate that consideration of multiple coherent scattering of traveling electronic waves , both through single - particle as well as many - body resonances , is crucial for the understanding of the resulting conductance features . in this regard , being able to tune the structure parameters of a multiple qd system , as well as its kondo state , provides a unique arena to study correlations and coherence effects in a controllable manner .",
    "it is clear that the features of the kondo resonance near the fermi level significantly affect the conductance of the system , sometimes in quite subtle ways .",
    "for example , the shape of the density of states in the leads near the fl has been shown to produce strong modifications of the kondo resonance and characteristic energy ( the kondo temperature ) .",
    "these modifications can arise from intrinsic global properties,@xcite or from the local environment in the vicinity of the active qd.@xcite we are here especially interested in resonances and modifications due to the electronic version of the dicke effect .",
    "@xcite the latter is the electronic analogue of the well - known dicke effect in quantum optics , which takes place in the spontaneous emission of closely - linked atoms lying in the same environment ( within one characteristic wavelength of each other).@xcite in the electronic case , the decay rates ( level broadenings ) are produced by the couplings between localized levels and a conduction channel , and their close proximity and effective coupling gives rise to effectively fast ( _ super - tunneling _ ) and slow ( _ sub - tunneling _ ) modes.@xcite interestingly , this coherent single - particle physics results in strong changes of the kondo screening , as we will discuss below , once coulomb interactions are fully taken into account .    although other multidot geometries would exhibit similar physics , a specific configuration to study this effect consists of three qds where two large ( essentially non - interacting ) dots are attached laterally to a central dot that is embedded between current leads , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "this cross - bar structure is reminiscent of quantum wave guides with a resonator cavity . @xcite in our case , the side qds act as scattering centers to the main transport channel , and compete with the kondo effect of the central dot.@xcite similar configurations have been studied before , and recent work by trocha and barnas using a slave boson mean field approach has identified interesting regimes.@xcite they studied the interplay between kondo and dicke resonances and considered the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion ( @xmath1 ) , which suppresses virtual processes involving the doubly occupied state in the interacting dot .",
    "additionally , the mean - field approximation adopted in the auxiliary boson fields neglects correlations due to charge fluctuations involving the empty state of the dot .",
    "all of these processes may be expected to be important in providing a full description of the kondo resonance , especially in competition with the dicke effect here , as we indeed show in this work .",
    "our numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach , @xcite provides a reliable description that incorporates all charge and spin fluctuations in the problem , it allows the study of finite @xmath0 values  corresponding to real qd experiments  and gives us a systematic way to study the subtle interference effects inherent in this geometry .    in this work",
    ", we explore the kondo state that appears when the levels of the non - interacting dots are brought together both symmetrically and asymmetrically about the fermi level .",
    "in both situations , the kondo resonance narrows drastically and is `` squeezed '' between the two single - particle levels , suggesting a drop in the kondo temperature of the system , as described recently in the symmetric case.@xcite we show that indeed the kondo temperature drops , as the onset of the dicke effect involving the interacting dot totally suppresses the kondo state and results in _ vanishing _ kondo temperature .",
    "this behavior , due to the enhancement of spin - spin correlations in the qds orbitals , results in the formation of a _ local _ singlet , which decouples from the current leads . as the system moves away from a fully degenerate dicke configuration ,",
    "the kondo temperature is non - zero but has a non - monotonic dependence on structure parameters , behavior which is only brought out by our numerical renormalization group approach .",
    "this optimization of the kondo effect in a structure may have interesting applications in a real experimental system .",
    "we will further show that the competition of kondo and dicke effects modifies excited states near the kondo regime as well , resulting in unexpected changes in the thermodynamic and transport properties of the system .",
    "interestingly , the local ( non - kondo ) singlet state mentioned above emerges due to a strong coupling between the interacting qd and the super - tunneling state .",
    "a crossover between these two configurations can be tuned by varying the coupling between the qds .",
    "we also describe the effects of asymmetries in the system , including different interdot couplings , as well as energy levels and finite coulomb interactions in all the dots of the structure .",
    "we show that these structural asymmetries introduce interesting particle - hole asymmetries in the problem , resulting in strong changes in the kondo temperatures and the linear conductance of the system .",
    "the system consists of an interacting qd ( labeled qd1 ) coupled to two current leads ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and to two effectively non - interacting qds ( qd2 and qd3 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; one could also think of qd2 and qd3 as being close to a coulomb blockade peak , so that they conduct and their behavior is single - resonance  like , as charging effects are typically small when conducting .",

[ phasym ] ) , we will take @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , while @xmath20 .    the characteristic properties of the kondo physics of the system will be probed through thermodynamic quantities , namely the local magnetic moment and its contribution to the entropy , which can be readily obtained from the nrg procedure . to calculate dynamical quantities , such as the spectral functions and the conductance of the system , one needs to calculate the local retarded green s function ( gf ) at the interacting dot , which is defined in the standard form , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23_+\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the double - time green s function , with @xmath24 the usual step function , and @xmath25_+$ ] the anticommutator .",

    "the self - energy can be written as @xmath33 in these expressions , the frequency @xmath34 must be understood in its analytical continuation sense , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an infinitesimal .",
    "notice that the poles at @xmath37 and @xmath38 appearing in the self - energy describe localized states in the effective conduction band due to the presence of qd2 and qd3 . in the limit of @xmath39 ,",
    "the self - energy reduces to the single impurity case , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hybridization function for a flat density of states , and @xmath42 is the half - bandwidth of the conduction electrons .",
    "notice that the effect of the leads and the two side - coupled qds is fully taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ green0 ] ) by the self - energy @xmath43 , which provides a  structured \" effective conduction band .",
    "the electrons localized in qd1 are then coupled via the effective density of states in the leads represented by @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) .    the spectral function , @xmath45 in this _ non - interacting case _ is depicted in fig .  [ fig12 ] for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and different values of @xmath49 .",
    "we observe that by increasing @xmath49 the width of the central peak increases , while the satellite peaks are just slightly shifted away from the fermi level .",
    "the shift of the satellite peak position can be estimated by analyzing the poles of @xmath50 . assuming the satellite peaks to be lorentzian - shaped",
    ", we find that their positions are given by @xmath51 . in the inset",
    "we show the peak positions as function of @xmath49 .",
    "the continuous ( black ) curve corresponds to the analytical expression @xmath52 , while symbols correspond to the values obtained from the curves in the main panel .",
    "the need for the factor 1.01 results from the assumption that the peak has a lorentzian shape in the analytical estimate .",
    "on the other hand , close to zero energy ( @xmath53 ) and for small detuning ( @xmath54 ) , the dos can be written as a superposition of a symmetric fano lineshape  arising from the super - tunneling dicke state  of width @xmath55 , and a lorentzian line  arising from the subtunneling state of width @xmath56 , respectively.@xcite this complex behavior of the dos is due to the hybridization of the lateral dots through the continuum of the central dot and leads .",
    "this phenomenon is in close analogy to the dicke effect in quantum optics.@xcite here , the super - tunneling and subtunneling modes give rise a broad ( @xmath57 ) antiresonance and a sharp ( @xmath58 ) resonance , respectively .",
    "as we will discuss later , this effect also modifies dramatically the many - body kondo state .",
    "we will now consider the interesting case of interactions in the central dot only , so that @xmath59 is finite , while @xmath60 . in this case , the system can also be mapped into a single qd coupled to an effective conduction band . in this case",
    "the dressed gf of the interacting dot can be formally written as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the proper self - energy which takes into account the influence of the lateral qds , the current leads , as well as the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 . unlike the non - interacting case , a closed expression for @xmath62 is not possible , due to the many - body term in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , @xmath26 can be reliably obtained using the nrg procedure.@xcite for convenience , we write the gf in the lehmann representation,@xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the partition function in the canonical ensemble , @xmath65 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath66 , with corresponding eigenenergy @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath26 is calculated at zero temperature ( @xmath69 ) directly from the nrg spectrum , @xcite while the real part can be obtained from a kramers - krnig transformation.@xcite      as we will see in the next section , it is also useful to analyze the details of the states involving the three qds , considering the system as a whole .",
    "this approach also proves essential when dealing with coulomb interactions in all three qds , as the approach of an effective density of states described in the previous section , is no longer applicable in the more general case . to that end",
    ", we solve the problem considering all the dots composing the  impurity region , \" so that the three - dot cluster is coupled to a flat conduction band .",
    "this requires a simple generalization of the nrg procedure : start with a cluster impurity described by a set of 64 basis states , on which one writes and diagonalizes the initial hamiltonian , @xmath70 , while the current lead is characterized by a flat density of states . for these nrg",
    " cluster impurity \" runs , we typically keep 1600 states and use a discretization parameter @xmath71 , which provides sufficient accuracy for the spectral function in the scales of interest .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath72 ( typically the largest energy scale of the problem ) as our energy unit .",
    "we further consider the coulomb repulsion @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , which corresponds to a particle - hole symmetric system with interactions in qd1 . in order to study the dicke effect in this system we first focus on the particle - hole symmetric point _ of the entire system .",
    "_ to this end , we tune the on - site energies @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the non - interacting qds ( @xmath75 ) symmetrically displaced from the fermi level , for which we set @xmath76 . with this choice of parameters , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) shows two poles located at @xmath77 , which produce strong enhancement of the effective coupling @xmath78 .",
    "this results in a dramatic distortion of the local interacting dos projected in qd1 , @xmath79 , with important implications on the properties of the system .",
    "we first fix @xmath49 ( @xmath80 ) and vary the interdot coupling @xmath81 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath82 ( @xmath83 in eq .",
    "[ rho1eq ] ) , for several values of @xmath81 .",
    "the solid ( black ) curve shows the case @xmath84 , which corresponds to the typical case of a qd coupled to a conduction band with a flat density of states .",
    "notice the kondo resonance at the fermi level in addition to the two hubbard peaks at @xmath85 ( see inset ; which give rise to coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance at appropriate gate voltages ) .",
    "the width of the kondo peak is proportional to the kondo temperature , which in this case is @xcite @xmath86 . as @xmath81 increases",
    ", the low - energy structure of @xmath87 is strongly modified .",
    "two satellite peaks emerge symmetrically about the central peak at @xmath88 .",
    "these peaks become more pronounced for larger @xmath81 and the distance between them increases somewhat more than @xmath89 , as one would expect from the non - interacting regime . the widths of the satellite peaks increase as @xmath81 increases , similarly to the non - interacting case , where their width is given by @xmath90 .",
    "notice also fano antiresonances in @xmath91 between the central and satellite peaks , located at @xmath92 .",
    "these antiresonances result from destructive interference between the kondo state of qd1 and the localized levels in the lateral qds.@xcite we will discuss this point in greater detail below .    it is interesting to notice that the central kondo resonance peak width shows a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath81 , first increasing with @xmath81 , but decreasing after a particular value .",
    "this behavior , first identified in ref .   from the slave boson approximation , suggests that the kondo temperature has a similar behavior , although this suspicion was not explicitly verified . using nrg",
    ", we find indeed that to be the case . in fig .",
    "[ tk](a ) we show @xmath93 as function of @xmath81 for @xmath94 , and obtain a clearly convex curve with a maximum value ( @xmath95 ) at @xmath96 , in agreement with the behavior seen in the kondo resonance in fig .",
    "we should emphasize that @xmath93 for @xmath97 is _ larger _ than for the isolated qd1 , @xmath98 ( see value above ) .",
    "the zero - energy resonance also depends strongly on @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows @xmath87 for @xmath99 and several values of @xmath49 .",
    "notice that all curves show well - defined peaks and their positions remain nearly constant at either @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "however , the dips between the kondo and the satellite peaks are less pronounced for larger @xmath49 , and their position shifts with @xmath49 , as can also be seen in the inset .",
    "the displacement of the dips toward the fermi level as @xmath49 decreases produces a  squeezing \" of the kondo peak at the fermi energy . the most evident situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the case of @xmath102 , when the kondo resonance takes the form of a narrow and sharp peak .",
    "the behavior of @xmath93 with @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ tk](b ) , and it is clearly non - monotonic as well . notice that for @xmath10305 we find a maximum value of @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "more importantly , the `` squeezing '' of the kondo resonance as @xmath106 is accompanied by a strong suppression of @xmath93 , which vanishes completely as @xmath107 .",
    "the above behavior is a clear signal of the influence of the subtunneling mode on the kondo state .",
    "indeed , one can understand these results in terms of the dicke state physics .",
    "for small values of @xmath49 , the subtunneling dicke state dominates and the kondo temperature decreases . for sufficiently large values of @xmath49",
    "the supertunneling dicke state dominates and the kondo temperature reaches its maximum value . for larger @xmath49 values , however , the system goes out of the dicke regime and the kondo temperature drops .",
    "@xcite we should also comment that the total suppression of the kondo screening for @xmath108 is essentially a quantum phase transition , which results in the qd cluster isolating itself from the current leads .",
    "perhaps one way to view this suppression of kondo screening is to think of a kondo resonance in the central dot that interferes destructively with the single - particle  like resonances of the side - connected dots ( themselves hybridized with the leads via the central dot ) .",
    "the fact that all these resonances appear at the same energy , @xmath88 , results in the eventual suppression of the kondo state for the entire cluster . of course ,",
    "this is only a qualitative argument , ultimately validated by the nrg results .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism for this destructive interference and resulting ground state is fascinating , as we proceed to describe .    to provide a different perspective on the suppression of the kondo screening ( and vanishing kondo temperature ) , we study the thermodynamical properties of the system , namely the contribution of the impurity to the magnetic moment , @xmath109 , and the entropy , @xmath110 , from which one extracts information about the nature of the states the system visits when the parameters are varied . as usual , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( with @xmath115 ) are thermodynamical quantities of the system calculated _ with _ and _ without _ impurity , respectively .",
    "the magnetic moment and the entropy can be written in terms of the magnetic susceptibility and the partition function as @xmath116 , and @xmath117 ( we set @xmath118 ) . in order to study the effects of all three dots , we employ here",

    "lets us examine the result for @xmath120 ( small open circles , purple ) , corresponding to a single impurity case , as qd2 and qd3 have their level at the fermi energy ( @xmath121 ) but are decoupled from the rest of the system ( @xmath84)we include this curve as a reference for the more general cases . for @xmath122 ,",

    "dq1 undergoes a crossover into a kondo singlet state and its magnetic moment is screened by the conduction band , while qd2 and qd3 remain in their free orbital states ( since @xmath126 and @xmath121 ) , resulting in a net unscreened magnetic moment of @xmath127 and entropy @xmath128 for the three - dot cluster .    for @xmath129",
    ", different regimes can be found . in the low temperature limit ( @xmath130 )",
    "the system always flows into a kondo state , where qd1 is in a kondo singlet configuration with the reservoirs , while qd2 and qd3 are combined into a symmetric / antisymmetric pair of states , one of which is doubly occupied ( and the other empty ) at @xmath69 , as schematically shown in fig .

    "we allow the level @xmath182 to be different from @xmath183 . for convenience ,",
    "we keep @xmath184 and change @xmath0 , which allows not only to explore the effect of the particle - hole asymmetry but also the effect of larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the spectral function vs.  energy for @xmath94 and various values of @xmath0 . the curve for @xmath73 , corresponding to the symmetric case studied in sec .",
    "[ symmetric ] , exhibits two peaks symmetrically placed about the fermi level , as well as hubbard bands located near @xmath182 and @xmath185 , as can be seen in the inset of the figure .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , one clearly observes that the curves no longer display particle - hole symmetry .",
    "we observe a decreasing height of the central peak , as well as a minor shift in position , while its width remains almost unchanged with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "more interesting , we notice that the satellite peak below the fermi level is suppressed and shifted toward @xmath88 , while the corresponding peak on the positive side is nearly unchanged .",
    "this is a clear consequence of breaking particle - hole symmetry in the problem .",
    "we have also investigated the role of non - vanishing coulomb interactions in the side dots qd2 and qd3 . to that effect",
    ", the problem is addressed using nrg for the three quantum dot complex treated as a cluster impurity , as described in sec .",
    "[ cia ] , and with the inclusion of a non - zero coulomb interaction @xmath186 .",
    "figure [ uprime ] presents the spectral function for different values of @xmath187 , for qd2 and qd3 levels placed asymmetrically about the fermi level ( @xmath94 ) . for @xmath75",
    "the system is particle - hole symmetric ( as @xmath74 ) , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for increasing @xmath187 ,",
    "however , the asymmetry in the spectral function is evident , strongly shifting and suppressing the kondo resonance near the fermi level .",
    "this indicates the important role that coulomb interactions in the nearby dots have in the overall correlations present in the system , and suggests that the observation of the dicke effect is indeed a delicate undertaking .",
    "we now turn our attention to the effect on the conductance of the system of the various features discussed above .",
    "it is clear that the details of the density of states at the fermi level are directly connected to the zero - temperature transport properties in linear response . in the zero - bias limit",
    ", the conductance of the system can be obtained by the landauer formula , @xmath188\\left ( \\partial f(\\omega)/\\partial \\omega\\right)d \\omega$ ] , where @xmath189 is the fermi distribution function and , in the present case , @xmath190 . at @xmath69",
    "the conductance reduces to @xmath191 . from the density of states in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] we observe that for all values of @xmath81 and @xmath192 , the dos always exhibits a kondo peak at the fermi level ( which becomes very narrow and sharp as @xmath106 ) .",
    "since the conductance of the system is proportional to the density of states of dq1 , this results in unitary conductance ( @xmath193 ) for all values of @xmath81 and @xmath192 , discontinuously dropping to zero at @xmath121 .",
    "the above behavior is explained by the complete localization of the subtunneling state for @xmath121 . in this case",
    "the state has no projection on the central quantum dot and therefore it does not contribute to the conduction .",
    "similarly , one would expect vanishing conductance for small bias as long as @xmath121 .",
    "@xcite    an interesting result of the particle - hole asymmetry , as we have seen in the previous section , is to shift the kondo resonance away from the fermi level , as well as to change its amplitude .",
    "this has direct impact on the linear conductance of the structure .",
    "figure [ figlast ] illustrates this behavior for different asymmetries ( notice in fact that although @xmath164 and @xmath165 are constant in this figure , increasing @xmath180 or @xmath49 value increases the asymmetry of the structure ) . in both cases , the conductance is indeed found to change drastically with the appropriate parameter .",
    "it is interesting that asymmetry in the qd2 and qd3 level position ( for @xmath175 ) and increasing dot coupling @xmath180 results in a strong suppression of the linear conductance , even as the kondo temperature of the system ( fig .",
    "[ tksa]a ) is _",
    "increasing_. on the other hand , the enhancement of @xmath93 that we see for the coupling asymmetry ( @xmath172 ) in fig .",
    "[ tksa]b , does produce a rapid increase in conductance for larger @xmath49 values .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the interplay of dicke and kondo effects in a central strongly interacting quantum dot coupled to a conduction band and two localized levels provided by additional nearly non - interacting dots .",
    "we study in detail the kondo regime of the system , by applying a numerical renormalization group analysis to a finite-@xmath0 multi - impurity anderson hamiltonian model .",
    "we find that the system displays a  squeezed \" kondo resonance as we tune the single particle levels of the side - coupled dots toward the fermi level . in the strict dicke limit of degenerate single - particle levels",
    ", the kondo singlet disappears , as its kondo temperature vanishes .",
    "this behavior is found to be closely related to the formation of a local singlet state involving the ( coupled ) orbitals of the interacting dot and the super - tunneling state ( the symmetric combination of the single particle levels of the two side coupled dots ) .",
    "this local singlet results in the suppression of the kondo screening , which is detrimental to the conductance of the system . we have further explored the consequences of system asymmetries , introduced by different couplings , level locations and coulomb interactions .",
    "these are found to strongly affect the spectral density and the conductance through the structure .",
    "we believe that our study not only clarifies the relevant picture of an interacting system coupled to side quantum dots and conduction band , but it also provides important guidelines for experimental realization of these ideas .",
