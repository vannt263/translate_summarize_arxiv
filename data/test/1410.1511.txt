    "cosmic strings are linear gravitational stable topological defects which may have been created as a consequence of phase transitions in the early universe and are predicted in the context of the standard gauge field theory of elementary particle physics with extra symmetries @xcite .",
    "observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) by cobe , wmap and more recently by the planck satellite have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbations since they can not explain the acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum .",
    "however , a couple of other effects due to cosmic strings can be investigated through the observations of cmb , such as non - gaussianity signals and temperature anisotropies caused by the gravitational field of moving strings ( see @xcite for a recent analysis of the possible effects of strings on cmb ) .",
    "furthermore , the formation of strings can also have astrophysical and cosmological consequences .",
    "for instance , emission of gravitational waves and high energy cosmic rays by strings such as neutrinos and gamma - rays , along with observational data , can help to constraint the product of the newton s constant , @xmath2 , and the linear mass density of the string @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "all these effects can also be generated by cosmic strings formed in the context of brane inflation , which makes the physics of cosmic strings a wide area of worth investigation . in this paper , we will only focus on the effects generated by the spacetime of a infinitely long straight static cosmic string as explained below .",
    "the geometry of the spacetime associated with an idealized cosmic string , i.e. , infinitely long and straight , is locally flat but topologically conical , having a planar angle deficit given by @xmath4 on the two - surface orthogonal to the string .",
    "although this object was first introduced in the literature as being created by a dirac - delta type distribution of energy and axial stress along a straight infinity and line , it can also be described by classical field theory where the energy - momentum tensor associated with the maxwell - higgs system , investigated by nielsen and olesen in @xcite , couples to the einstein s equations .",
    "this coupled system was further investigated by garfinkle and linet in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these authors have shown that a planar angle deficit , @xmath5 , arises on the two - surface perpendicular to a string , as well as a magnetic flux running through its core .",
    "although the geometry of the spacetime produced by an idealized cosmic string is locally flat , its conical structure alters the vacuum fluctuations associated with quantum fields . as a consequence",
    ", the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of physical observables like the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath6 , gets a nonzero value .",
    "the calculation of the vev of physical observables associated with the scalar and fermionic fields in the cosmic string spacetime has been developed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a magnetic flux running through the core of the string gives additional contributions to the vevs associated with charged fields @xcite as well as induces vacuum current densities , @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated for massless and massive scalar fields in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in these papers",
    ", the authors have shown that induced vacuum current densities along the azimuthal direction arise if the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one has a nonzero fractional part .",

    "the induced fermionic current by a magnetic flux in @xmath8-dimensional conical spacetime and in the presence of a circular boundary has also been analyzed in @xcite .",

    "the currents along compact dimensions generate magnetic filed in the uncompactified subspace .",
    "the magnetic fields induced by the vacuum currents provide an additional channel for interaction of cosmic string with the enviroment . here , in the present paper , we shall continue along the same line of investigation .",
    "we shall calculate the induced bosonic current in a higher - dimensional cosmic string spacetime , under the same conditions as considered in these two previous publications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section [ wightman ] is devoted to the evaluation of the positive frequency wightman function for a massive charged scalar quantum field in a higher - dimensional cosmic string spacetime .",
    "we also consider that the @xmath12-axis along the string is compactified to a circle , by imposing a quasiperiodic boundary condition on the bosonic field with arbitrary phase .",
    "moreover we assume the presence of magnetic fluxes running through the string s core and enclosed by its axis . in section [ current ] , by using the wightman function , we evaluate the renormalized vacuum current density induced by the magnetic fluxes and the compactification . as we shall see , the renormalized charge density and the radial current vanish .",
    "for the azimuthal current density , the compactification induces it to decompose into two parts : one of them coincides with the corresponding expression in the geometry of a cosmic string without compactification and the other is the contribution due to the compactification itself .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of the compactification , a non - vanishing axial current also arises and is a purely topological one .",
    "the most relevant conclusions of the paper are summarized in section [ conc ] .",

    "<S> in this paper , we analyse the bosonic current densities induced by a magnetic flux running along an idealized cosmic string in a high - dimensional spacetime , admitting that the coordinate along the string s axis is compactified . </S>",
    "<S> additionally we admit the presence of an magnetic flux enclosed by the compactification axis . in order to develop this analysis we calculate the complete set of normalized bosonic wave - functions obeying a quasiperiodicity condition , with arbitrary phase @xmath0 , along the compactified dimension . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> only azimuthal and axial currents densities take place . as to the azimuthal current , two contributions appear . </S>",
    "<S> the first contribution corresponds to the standard azimuthal current in a cosmic string spacetime without compactification , while the second contribution is a new one , induced by the compactification itself . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is an even function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis and is an odd function of the magnetic flux along its core with period equal to quantum flux , @xmath1 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the nonzero axial current density is an even function of the magnetic flux along the core of the string and an odd function of the magnetic flux enclosed by it . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the axial current density vanishes for untwisted and twisted bosonic fields in the absence of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis . </S>",
    "<S> some asymptotic expressions for the current density are provided for specific limiting cases of the physical parameter of the model .    </S>",
