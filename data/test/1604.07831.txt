    "neutron stars in high mass x - ray binaries are powered by the release of gravitational energy from the matter accreting from their companion star .",
    "the magnetic field of the ns ( @xmath1 g ) drives the accreting matter along its field lines towards the magnetic polar caps . as a result an accretion column forms , where matter is slowed up by radiative processes that produce x - rays .",
    "the same magnetic field modifies the radiation emitted in the regions above the polar caps : in the presence of such a strong magnetic field , the kinetic energy of the electrons in the accreting plasma is quantized in discrete landau levels and photons with energies corresponding to these levels undergo resonant scattering , imprinting on the x - ray spectrum cyclotron resonant scattering features ( crsf ) .",
    "the energy of the fundamental line provides a direct measure of the magnetic field in the region where the line is produced , according to the relation @xmath2 kev , where @xmath3 is the gravitational redshift in the line forming region and @xmath4 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath5 g. crsfs have been observed in @xmath6 pulsars @xcite , probing magnetic fields in the range @xmath7 g. in some sources it has been observed that the position of the line changes as a function of the luminosity implying that the optically thick region where the line is imprinted moves along the accretion columns for as much as some hundred meters @xcite .",
    "v0332 + 53 is an accreting x - ray pulsar with a spin period of @xmath8 s , orbiting around an early type companion star @xcite in an eccentric orbit of @xmath9 d @xcite .",
    "the source shows sporadic giant x - ray outbursts lasting several weeks , followed by years - long intervals of quiescence . in 1989 an outburst recorded by",
    "the ginga observatory revealed the presence of a cyclotron absorption feature @xcite at @xmath10 kev , corresponding to a magnetic field of @xmath11 g. between november 2004 and february 2005 a giant outburst was monitored with the rossi xte and integral observatories in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the position of the peak energy of the cyclotron line changed during the outburst in anti - correlation with the luminosity , going from @xmath12 kev at the onset of the outburst to @xmath13 kev at the luminosity peak , and returning to @xmath12 kev at the end of the outburst , following the same track in both the brightening and the fading phase .",
    "this is interpreted with the infalling plasma being decelerated along the accretion columns by a radiation dominated shock @xcite , whose height above the ns surface increases with luminosity . if the height of the line forming region follows the height of the shock , the observed anti - correlation is straightforwardly explained as the magnetic field weakens with the distance from the polar cap .",

    "4 we discuss our results .",
    "v0332 + 53 went into outburst between june and september 2015 . the burst alert telescope ( bat , @xcite ) on board the swift observatory @xcite performed a nearly continuous monitoring in the 15 - 150 kev energy band , while the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt , @xcite ) covered the soft x - ray band ( 0.6 - 10 kev ) with several pointed observations .",
    "bat is a coded mask telescope that observes the sky in the 15150 kev energy range with a field of view of 1.4 steradian ( half coded ) .",
    "it is devoted to an all - sky monitoring with the main aim of capturing gamma ray burst events .",
    "the pointing strategy of swift , that performs frequent slews to observe different sky directions , allows bat to monitor more than @xmath14 of the entire sky every day . v0332 + 53 was observed by bat with a daily duty - cycle of @xmath15 .",
    "the bat survey data stored in the heasarc public archive were processed with the bat_imager code @xcite , a software built for the analysis of data from coded mask instruments that performs screening , mosaicking and source detection . the background subtracted light curve and spectra of v0332 + 53 were produced with the maximum time resolution allowed by the data ( typically 300 s ) . to obtain spectra with similar and sufficient statistics ,",
    "we selected time intervals of different duration to achieve a minimum signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of 300 . only for the first and the last interval , in order to measure @xmath16 at the lowest fluxes , the spectra were cumulated with a lower snr ( @xmath17 ) . with this selection we obtained 22 spectra .",
    "we used the official bat spectral redistribution matrix .",
    "xrt ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) observed v0332 + 53 thirty - one times during the outburst . for each bat spectral time interval we used only the temporally closest xrt observation .",
    "all the selected observations are in windowed timing mode @xcite .",
    "the xrt data were processed with standard filtering and screening criteria ( xrtpipeline v.0.12.4 , heasoft v. 6.12 ) . for each observation we extracted the spectrum by selecting data from a rectangular region of 40 pixel side along the image strip ( 1 pixel = 2.36  ) centered on the source brightest pixel ;",
    "the background was extracted from a region of the same size far from the source extraction region .",
    "the spectra were re - binned with a minimum of 20 counts per energy channel to allow for the use of @xmath18 statistics .",
    "the xrt ancillary response files were generated with xrtmkarf .",

    "figure  [ lc ] shows the 1150 kev luminosity ( @xmath20 ) of the 2015 outburst derived from the bat monitoring .",
    "its shape can be described with a linear rise and decline , roughly specular with respect to a peak that lasted @xmath21 days reaching a luminosity of @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 .    to cope with the non - simultaneity of the bat and xrt data",
    ", we included in the spectral model a multiplicative factor that takes into account any mismatch in intensity between the hard and soft data . to model the continuum emission of the source we tested different spectral shapes , modified at low energy by photo - electric absorption along the line of sight : a simple power law modified with an exponential cut - off , a negative - positive power laws with exponential cutoff ( npex @xcite ) , an optically thick comptonization ( comptt in xspec ) .",
    "we verified that the choice of the continuum model does not affect the results discussed in this letter . in the following",
    "we will adopt a continuum described by a power law modified with an exponential cut - off ( cutoffpl in xspec ) .",
    "we included in the model two crsfs , the fundamental line and its second harmonic , using absorption gaussian profiles ( gabs in xspec ) .",
    "the residuals in all the 22 spectra do not statistically require any additional component to model the fundamental crsf .",
    "the results of the spectral analysis are reported in table 1 .",
    "the continuum emission does not show any noteworthy variability : the photon index does not change significantly along the outburst , while the cutoff energy ranges between 6.2 and 7.1 kev .",
    "the position of the fundamental ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) , the line width and its depth are determined on average with relative uncertainties of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the relative uncertainties on the parameters of the second harmonic ( detected at @xmath27 kev ) are much higher , and in the following we will focus only on the energy of the fundamental line ( e@xmath28 ) . figure  [ spec2_21 ] shows the data , best fit model and residuals for two representative spectra with similar luminosity in the rise and decline ( spectra 2 and 21 in table  [ fit ] ) .",
    "the cyclotron energy shows a clear anticorrelation with luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ evsflux ] , black diamonds ) .",
    "moreover , the cyclotron energy describes clearly two different diverging tracks for the outburst rise and decline , being systematically lower after the peak , reaching a final value of @xmath29 kev versus an initial value of @xmath30 kev .",
    "we investigated the correlation between e@xmath28 and the other fit parameters .",
    "figure  [ contour ] shows the confidence contour plots between the energy of the fundamental and the photon index , the cutoff energy and the width of the line , respectively , evaluated for the two representative spectra 2 and 21 .",
    "the plots show that there is no significant correlation between e@xmath28 and the continuum parameters , and a weak correlation between e@xmath31 and the line width @xmath32 .",
    "the single - parameter 68% error ranges evaluated from the fit procedure represent adequately the bi - dimensional confidence contours . moreover , for each couple of parameters , the contour plots relevant to the two spectra are very well detached .",
    "we have also checked if the variability path we observe in the line energy is biased by the variation of e@xmath19 measured along the outburst .",
    "therefore , we have fitted the spectra fixing e@xmath19 to the average of the values reported in table  [ fit ] , obtaining again a double track that overlaps with excellent agreement the one obtained when e@xmath19 is left as a free parameter ( fig .",
    "[ evsflux ] , grey triangles ) . finally , we note that cyclotron lines may have complex profiles @xcite , as also reported by some authors for v0332 + 53 @xcite . the observational limits in our data do not allow us to assess if a change in the line profile could affect the determination of the centroid energy , although we argue that , if present , such a systematic would hardly produce systematically different line centroids at equal luminosities as shown in fig .",

    "the anticorrelation between the fundamental crsf energy and luminosity was already observed in the 2004/05 outburst @xcite .",
    "however , in the 2015 outburst we find a remarkably significant difference in the path described by the cyclotron energy versus luminosity : while in the 2004/05 outburst the energy of the fundamental appears to follow the same path both during the rise and the decline , so that the intensity of the magnetic field is the same at the onset and at the end of the outburst , in 2015 the energy of the fundamental follows two distinct tracks , with a difference of @xmath33  1.5 kev between the energy measured at the onset and at the end of the outburst .",
    "@xcite have shown that the energy of the fundamental is variable with the pulse phase and that the variability pattern changes for different luminosity levels .",
    "they explain this behaviour with a change in the beam pattern along the line of sight and in the structure of the emission region . the interpulse variability pattern may affect the position of the crsf fundamental in the phase - averaged spectra , and if the double track in fig .  [ evsflux ] arises from different variability patterns in e@xmath28 at equal luminosity levels , we would expect a corresponding change in the pulse profiles .",
    "we have produced 0.3 - 10 kev pulse profiles using the xrt data collected along the outburst : the profile shows a substantial shape evolution , from a double peak profile at low luminosity to a single peak at high luminosity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ profili ] shows that the profiles at similar luminosity levels close to the beginning and the end of the outburst have consistent shapes .",
    "indeed , while both cyclotron line energy and pulse profile shape are known to change significantly with pulse phase and luminosity ( tsygankov 2006 , lutovinov 2015 ) , a significant fraction of the energy flux is emitted in the soft band where , as we demonstrated , the pulse profile remains stable .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the xrt profiles in the soft x - rays provides a hint against the hypothesis of a geometrical beam variation .    if , on the other hand , the line forming region is the same at equal luminosities the observed difference in the cyclotron energy corresponds to a difference in the magnetic field of @xmath34 g ( assuming @xmath3=0.3 at the surface of a ns with a mass of 1.4@xmath35 and a radius of 10 km ) .",
    "an intriguing question is why the field drop has not been observed also in the 2004/05 outburst .",
    "figure  [ compare ] , that compares the light curves of the two outbursts ( top panel ) and the cumulative accreted mass ( bottom panel ) , shows a substantial difference : although the total mass accreted at the end of the two outbursts is similar , during the 2004/05 outburst a higher luminosity ( 1.5 times that of 2015 ) is reached earlier .",
    "therefore , we argue that the splitting in two branches of the @xmath36 versus @xmath37 depends on how the mass accretes along the outburst , and not simply on the total accreted mass , in agreeement with previous suggestions that the decay of the magnetic field is not directly proportional to the total accreted mass @xcite .    among the several mechanism that can induce a decay of the magnetic field through accretion ( see e.g. @xcite ) the one that seems to accord better with the observations is diamagnetic screening @xcite . in this hypothesis",
    "the accreting plasma builds up to form a magnetically confined mound , where the gas pressure balances the magnetic stresses .",
    "this would produce , as an overall effect , a distortion of the field lines @xcite observed as a decrease of the field component along the accretion column .",
    "however , for higher peak luminosities , the magnetic cap surface is larger and it is conceivable that the field at its border is weaker , preventing the gas confinement .",
    "the fast rise time observed in the 2004/05 outburst could lead to this configuration at the very beginning of the outburst , hampering the formation of the mound .",
    "alternatively , the mound may have formed at an early stage of the outburst , reaching in a short time the maximum size for a stable structure .",
    "after that , an equilibrium was reached where the plasma settling on the mound was balanced by the matter leaking out from the mound . in this hypothesis",
    "we expect that for most of the outburst evolution the tracks do not diverge .",
    "this hypothesis is suggested by the first two points of the outburst rise in figure 3 in @xcite , that show e@xmath28 values significantly higher than the values at equal luminosity during the decline .",
    "however , the lack of coverage in the first ten days of the outburst prevents a firm conclusion on this point .    , where we adopt a mass - energy conversion factor @xmath38 , as commonly assumed for a neutron star .",
