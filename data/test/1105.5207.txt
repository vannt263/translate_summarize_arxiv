    "astronomical observations of @xmath0-rays with space - borne and ground - based telescopes have become important tools to pursue physical processes in the universe owing to the higher sensitivity and angular resolution than a decade ago . in particular , tev @xmath0-ray observations with high - energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) have revealed more than 50 @xmath0-ray sources in the galactic plane , offering new tools to uncover the highest energy phenomena in the interstellar space ( @xcite ; ) .    among the hess sources ,",

    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows h and @xmath1co line profiles toward the four positions a1 , a2 , b and c ( table [ tab:1 ] ) .    in order to test",
    "if the h emission is similar to the @xmath1co emission , we made subtraction of the h profiles toward the four positions and the reference h profiles ; the reference h profiles for each were taken at the same @xmath33 separated by @xmath71 on the both sides ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] indicate that these subtracted h profiles show fairly similar shapes and intensities to those of the @xmath1co profiles toward mg358.9 - 0.5 in their peak velocity and linewidth .",
    "the similarity leads us to suggest that the h emission is from h gas physically connected to mg358.9 - 0.5 but without @xmath1co emission .",
    "we note that the absorption of the radio continuum emission is not important in the direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the h emission in the negative velocity range consists of three features ; the 3-kpc arm at @xmath74",
    "km s@xmath6 @xcite , the @xmath75 km s@xmath6 feature and the @xmath76 km s@xmath6 feature .",
    "the 3-kpc arm is located in front of and outside the gc and is not seen in the @xmath1co emission in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the @xmath77 km s@xmath6 feature is likely distributed within 1 kpc of the gc @xcite .",
    "the @xmath78 km s@xmath6 feature is perhaps located within the inner few 100 pc , similar to the cmz , and is physically related to the @xmath1co counterpart of hess j1745 - 303 , mg358.9 - 0.5 .",
    "the contamination by the 3-kpc arm masks the h emission above @xmath79 km s@xmath6 , while the @xmath1co emission at the position a2 ( figure [ fig : spectra](2 ) ) suggests the velocity of the h counterpart may be extended to @xmath80 km s@xmath6 .",
    "h column density is calculated by the following relation if the line is optically thin , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is brightness temperature in unit of k. the h integrated intensities of 160270 k km s@xmath6 , which are given by assuming single - gaussian profiles with fwhm line - widths of 3050 km s@xmath6 and a peak intensity of 5 k , correspond to h column density of @xmath83 @xmath62 when the line is optically thin as usually assumed . the average h density is then estimated to be 35 @xmath68 for a line - of - sight length of 30 pc .",
    "an alternative is that the h line may be optically thick , because the h line profile seems fairly similar to that of the optically thick @xmath1co line ( figure [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "if so , the h emission is from dense atomic gas with lower temperature close to that of the @xmath1co cloud as suggested by the peak temperature of h similar to @xmath1co ; we are not able to estimate the h density , but can constrain the average density to be @xmath84 @xmath68 by assuming that the h is less dense to emit @xmath1co . adopting spin temperature @xmath85@xmath86 k which is comparable to the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas in the cmz ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we estimate the h column density to be @xmath87 @xmath62 for the h peak optical depth @xmath88 greater than @xmath89 and a linewidth of @xmath54 km s@xmath6 by using the following relation ;    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the light velocity , @xmath92 the planck constant , @xmath93 the boltzmann constant , @xmath94 mhz the rest frequency and @xmath95 s@xmath6 einstein s @xmath96 coefficient .",
    "we then obtain @xmath97 @xmath68 by dividing the column density by the typical size of the @xmath0-rays , @xmath54 pc . considering the upper limit for the average density",

    "@xcite reported that there is no significant spectral variability across hess j1745 - 303 and suggested a single origin of the tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "it is to be noted that the hess detection is at @xmath110 level toward the southern part of hess j1745 - 303 and the distribution of the spectral index is yet to be confirmed by higher sensitivity .",
    "the authors also showed that the @xmath0-ray source has no extended x - ray source in the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "@xcite confirmed the lack of non - thermal x - ray counterpart and argued that the leptonic model requires weak magnetic field strength , @xmath111 @xmath112 g in a @xmath113 @xmath68 model and @xmath114 @xmath112 g in a @xmath115 @xmath68 model , to explain an observed upper limit of x - ray flux in the @xmath116@xmath117 kev band , @xmath118 erg s@xmath6 @xmath62 .",

    "this suggests that the hadronic scenario is favorable in hess j1745 - 303 . the positional coincidence with the unidentified egret source 3eg j1744 - 3011 @xcite , also known as the agile first - catalog source 1agl j1746 - 3017 @xcite , again supports the hadronic scenario which usually predict bright gev @xmath0-rays , though positional accuracy of the egret / agile source is not high enough .",
    "@xcite argued for the hadronic process that the @xmath1co cloud mg358.9 - 0.5 is responsible for the northern part of hess j1745 - 303 , whereas the ism corresponding to the southern part of hess j1745 - 303 remained unidentified .",
    "we argue that the @xmath1co cloud has a dense h envelope with no @xmath1co emission and that the h envelope is responsible for the @xmath0-ray production by cosmic - ray protons ; it is likely that the h envelope has moderately high density like @xmath65 @xmath68 and @xmath121 of 3060 k , significantly less than @xmath65 k ( see section [ sect : hiresults ] ) .",
    "we recall that the galactic @xmath0-ray emission requires the component unseen either in @xmath1co or warm h as indicated by an analysis of egret data @xcite .",
    "the `` dark gas '' component in @xmath1co or h in a galactic scale is also recognized in the visual / infrared extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in the dust emission obtained by the planck satellite @xcite . in the tev-@xmath0-ray snr rxj1713.7 - 3946",
    ", it has been shown that cold h gas observed as self - absorption dips matches well with the tev-@xmath0-ray shell , suggesting that such h having density @xmath65 @xmath68 with no @xmath1co emission works as target protons in the hadronic interaction @xcite . considering these , we suggest that the h cloud with no @xmath1co emission is a good candidate for the tev @xmath0-rays in the southern part and the tev @xmath0-ray emission of hess j1745 - 303 is likely due to accelerated protons interacting with the molecular / atomic clouds in the gc region .",

    "we discuss whether or not g359.1 - 0.5 is responsible for the cosmic - ray protons that produce the @xmath0-rays in hess j1745 - 303 . adopting a distance of 8.5 kpc",
    ", the total energy of cosmic - ray protons required to generate the observed tev @xmath0-ray flux can be estimated by the following relation ( e.g. , @xcite , ) ; @xmath122 where @xmath123 s is the characteristic cooling time of protons through the @xmath124 production channel , @xmath125 the @xmath0-ray luminosity , @xmath126 the mean proton density of the target ism , and @xmath127 the @xmath0-ray energy flux .",
    "table [ tab : cosmicrayenergy ] summarizes the @xmath127 in an energy range of 0.340 tev and estimated @xmath128 in the corresponding energy range approximately 3400 tev for regions a , b , c and a region covering the entire hess j1745 - 303 ( named `` full '' in @xcite ) .",
    "region a is close to g359.1 - 0.5 , while regions b and c are @xmath129 far away from it .",
    "the solid angle of region a as viewed from the center of g359.1 - 0.5 is about an order of magnitude larger than those of regions b and c. the number flux of the cosmic - ray protons from the snr should depend on distance to the target clouds , whereas the difference among the observed tev @xmath0-ray flux is not so significant .",
    "therefore , observed @xmath0-ray flux from hess j1745 - 303 does not support that the cosmic - ray protons originate from the snr shell .",
    "alternatively , we suggest that a more spatially distributed origin of cosmic ray protons over the @xmath0-ray source could be working in explaining the origin of hess j1745 - 303 .",
    "it is suggested that particle acceleration throughout the inter - cloud medium is responsible for the cosmic rays in the cmz ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dense gas clumps are moving at a high velocity dispersion of 15 km s@xmath6 typical to the cmz and in the other gc molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the present work showed that the beam - filling factor of the @xmath1co and dense h emitting clumps is 0.10.3 , indicating that there exits low - density inter - clump space .",
    "the average density of the @xmath1co and h clumps is in the order of 100 @xmath68 , not much different from each other within a factor of a few ( see section [ sect : results ] ) , and that of the inter - clump medium is likely less than 10 @xmath68 .",
    "we argue that the second - order fermi acceleration is taking place in the low - density inter - clump space , which is common between the @xmath1co and h clumps , and the accelerated cosmic - ray protons interact with the clumps to produce hadronic @xmath0-rays via neutral pion decay .",
    "the @xmath0-rays may therefore have a similar spectral index over the entire sources as suggested @xcite since both the @xmath1co and dense h gas share similar inter - clump properties .",
    "we note the energy density of the large turbulent motion in the gc is about 100 times higher than in the solar vicinity and is a reasonable source for the particle acceleration .",
    "we note that the three major peaks of tev @xmath0-rays in the cmz coincide with the molecular peaks with enhanced velocity dispersion ( see figure [ fig : cmz ] ) , as is consistent with the second - order fermi acceleration .",
    "amano  ( 2011 , in preparation ) have studied the second - order fermi acceleration in the cmz based on acceleration / energy - loss time scales and showed that the second - order fermi acceleration is able to accelerate protons up to @xmath65 tev range at density less than 10 @xmath68 .",
    "it is important to pursue this possibility further in order to better understand the @xmath0-rays in the gc by exploring more the role of the second - order fermi acceleration in the central few 100 pc .",
    "we have used the new @xmath1co @xmath2=21 data and the sgps h data to search for counterparts of the extended tev @xmath0-ray source hess j1745 - 303 in the gc .",
    "we suggest that the hadronic scenario is more favorable than the leptonic scenario because the fairly large magnetic field of more than 50 @xmath112 g is unfavorable to cosmic ray electrons to produce @xmath0-rays .",
    "the molecular cloud mg358.9 - 0.5 shows a reasonable positional agreement with the northern part of hess j1745 - 303 as already noted by @xcite . for the southern part of tev @xmath0-rays ,",
    "we see no @xmath1co counterpart , whereas the h gas with kinematics similar to the molecular cloud is a possible counterpart .",
    "we confirmed that the h gas is not local features but in the gc perhaps near the cmz as supported by their continuity to the cmz both in space and velocity .",
    "we discuss possible origins of the cosmic - ray protons and found that the snr g359.1 - 0.5 is not likely the source of cosmic - ray protons in the hadronic scenario because the estimated total energy of cosmic - ray protons required to produce the observed tev @xmath0-ray flux is more than what can be supplied by the snr .",
    "we argue that spatially extended injection of cosmic - ray protons is more plausible and suggest that the second - order fermi acceleration offers another possible mechanism to accelerate cosmic - ray protons . the turbulent motion with a velocity span of 30  100 km s@xmath6 commonly seen in the cmz including mg358.9 - 0.5",

    "<S> we have compared the tev @xmath0-rays with the new @xmath1co @xmath2=21 data toward hess j1745 - 303 in the galactic center and confirmed that molecular cloud mg358.9 - 0.5 toward @xmath3 at @xmath4@xmath5 km s@xmath6 shows a reasonable positional agreement with the primary peak ( northern part ) of the @xmath0-ray source . for the southern part of hess j1745 - 303 </S>",
    "<S> , we see no co counterpart , whereas the h gas in the sgps h dataset shows a possible counterpart to the @xmath0-ray source . this h gas may be optically thick as supported by the h line shape similar to the optically thick @xmath1co . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the total mass of interstellar protons including both the molecular and atomic gas to be @xmath7 and the cosmic - ray proton energy to be @xmath8 ergs in the hadronic scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible origins of the cosmic - ray protons including the nearby snr g359.1 - 0.5 . the snr may be able to explain the northern @xmath0-ray source but the southern source seems to be too far to be energized by the snr . as an alternative </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the second - order fermi acceleration in the inter - clump space surrounded by randomly moving high - velocity clumps may offer a possible mechanism to accelerate protons . </S>",
    "<S> the large turbulent motion with velocity dispersion of @xmath9 km s@xmath6 has energy density two orders of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity and is viable as the energy source . </S>"
