    "also shown in white are two m92 ridgelines , using data from @xcite , that are used to bracket the distance range in the hercules - aquila cloud .",
    "these suggest that the cloud in sdss dr5 is primarily composed of upper main sequence and turn - off stars at heliocentric distances of between 10 and 20 kpc .",

    "the first field covers the cloud ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "there are two comparison fields at larger longitude and higher latitude , namely field 2 at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and field 3 at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "most of the stars are at high latitude and selected to be bluer than the thin disk dwarfs .",

    "[ fig : vel ] , which reports velocities for all stars in field 1 .",

    "a mask based on the m92 ridgeline , shifted to 10 and 20 kpc .",
    "the distribution for field 1 centered on the hercules - aquila cloud is shown as a black solid line and can be compared to the histograms for the off - cloud fields 2 and 3 ( blue and red respectively ) .",
    "nearby thick disk stars in these locations have a line of sight velocity of @xmath61 kms@xmath51 with respect to the galactic standard of rest  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with the peaks in the red and blue histograms .",
    "there is a clear kinematic signal from stars moving coherently with a radial velocity of @xmath52 kms@xmath51 in the on - cloud field",
    ". this can not be due to either the halo or the thick disk .",
    "could the hercules - aquila cloud be related to the galactic bulge or bar ?",
    "there is an asymmetry in the integrated light of the bulge , famously seen by the dirbe instrument on the cobe satellite  @xcite , but it is only of the order of a few degrees at most  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this asymmetry would be larger if confined to stars in a range of heliocentric distances between 4 to 8 kpc , as we would then be primarily picking up stars on the near - side of the bar .",
    "however , our estimate of the distance to the hercules - aquila cloud is 10 to 20 kpc . at @xmath62 ,",
    "the closest the cloud can be to the galactic center is in the range @xmath63 to @xmath64 kpc .",
    "although the cloud passes through the disk , it seemingly lies well beyond the galactic bar .",
    "also , the cloud extends to galactic latitudes of @xmath65 , again much larger than the vertical scale - height of the bulge or of the thin and thick disks .",
    "@xcite also discovered some asymmetries in the distribution of bright , probably thick disc , stars using poss 1 data , but these stars are much closer at @xmath66 kpc from the sun .",
    "could the hercules - aquila cloud be a smooth component that is centered on @xmath67 but made to appear asymmetric by extinction ?",
    "most of the extinction is caused by dust with a scalelength of @xmath68 pc .",
    "however , there is a prominent north polar spur of dust that extends to high galactic latitudes  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bigmap ] as the extension to the black contour over latitudes @xmath69 to @xmath70 , where it overlaps part of the sagittarius stream",
    ". however , a similar amount of extinction appears to have no effect on the underlying density of detected stars in the sagittarius stream and the virgo overdensity at @xmath71 , and so variable extinction is not a plausible explanation of the offset structure .",
