    "identifying lower - luminosity radio galaxies at early cosmic epochs can help our understanding of the nature of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) hosts as a function of radio luminosity , and can help constrain cosmic evolution of the radio galaxy population .    by applying a cut in radio spectral index , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 )",
    ", we can preferentially select higher - redshift objects , since a combination of intrinsic evolutionary effects and an observational `` @xmath8-correction '' tend to cause @xmath6 to become steeper ( i.e. , more negative ) with increasing redshift ( for details see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig:4p5z ] , we plot the measured values of the 4.5  flux density from @xcite against redshift , along with tracks representing @xcite models with @xmath160 and solar metallicity , normalized to @xmath161 and @xmath162@xmath163 . plotting our hzrg  candidates in this figure at their best - fit photometric redshifts , these redshifts seem reasonable , although the lower bounds on the redshift ( assuming our objects have masses @xmath164@xmath163 ) are still quite weak ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "source c , with @xmath165 , falls below the @xmath161@xmath163  line , suggesting that it is either unusually low mass , or that the sed fitting underestimates the true redshift ( certainly possible given the wide confidence interval and low s / n for this source ) .",
    "source c  is the only outlier on the @xmath34  plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kz ] ) , again suggesting it is either very underluminous , or is in fact at higher redshift than suggested by the sed fits",
    ".     4.5  flux density versus redshift for hzrgs  with spectroscopic redshifts from @xcite ( circles ) , and our hzrg  candidates ( crosses , plotted at the best - fit photometric redshift with 68%  confidence intervals shown ) .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines are evolutionary tracks for elliptical galaxies with formation redshift @xmath160 and masses @xmath161 and @xmath162@xmath163 , respectively . ]    the nirc images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nirccon ] ) provide much higher resolution than irac , and we are able to see that two of the detected sources have somewhat extended , `` fuzzy '' morphologies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nirczoom ] ) .",
    "source e  is somewhat more compact , but appears to have a faint trail of material extending to the northeast .",
    "source b  seems to be quite compact and relatively bright .",
    "the extended sources have @xmath0-band morphologies suggestive of the optical morphologies seen in hzrgs  such as b20902 + 34 @xcite , which hints that these objects may be galaxies still in the process of formation ( again arguing for a higher redshift for source c  than that obtained from sed fitting ) .",
    "the compactness of the observed radio morphologies ( unresolved in our maps , except for source b ) suggests that we are probably seeing these radio galaxies relatively soon after the agn turn on . the deduced @xmath8-corrected rest - frame @xmath153-band magnitudes ( table  [ tab : pz ] ) imply optical luminosities a factor of a few times fainter than the most powerful @xmath2 radio galaxies as studied by @xcite and others , and the extended emission is a factor of a few smaller ( roughly @xmath166kpc as compared to @xmath167kpc for the more powerful sources ) .",
    "the extended radio emission of source b  ( @xmath168kpc if its @xmath156 is correct ) is typical of a classical double - lobed radio galaxy , which lends weight to the ( independent ) selection of a qso2 template in the sed fitting .",
    "radio galaxies are among the most massive objects at all redshifts @xcite , but there is some evidence for a dependence of host optical luminosity on radio power ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is plausible that our objects are less powerful in the radio and hence might be expected to be fainter than the @xmath34  relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kz ] ) ; they might , in fact , be still forming the bulk of their stars ( as suggested by their morphologies ) but the agn has already switched on .",
    "source b , which is more compact in the near - ir , and has more extended radio emission ( suggesting that the agn activity is less recent than in the other three sources ) is slightly brighter than the @xmath34  relation , again as might be expected in this scenario .    from the measured radio fluxes and spectral indices , and the best - fit photometric redshifts , we calculate rest - frame 151mhz luminosities ( for the @xmath157 sources ) of @xmath169w hz@xmath13 sr@xmath13 , which implies @xcite ly@xmath6  luminosities @xmath170ergs@xmath13 . the corresponding ly@xmath6  fluxes are @xmath171erg s@xmath13 @xmath116 , essentially independent of redshift ( due to similar effects of distance on the observed ly@xmath6  and radio fluxes , and hence the determination of rest - frame luminosities ) .",
    "a typical hzrg  ly@xmath6  line ( rest - frame fwhm @xmath172 ) would be marginally unresolved in our spectra at @xmath143 , but beyond @xmath173 , observed flux densities would start to decrease due to broadening of the ly@xmath6  line in the observed frame . at @xmath148 , the expected ly@xmath6  flux density is @xmath174erg s@xmath13 @xmath116 @xmath13 . since the noise in our spectra has @xmath175erg s@xmath13",
    "@xmath116 @xmath13 , the predicted s / n is rather low ( @xmath172 ) , so it is perhaps unsurprising that we see no emission lines in our spectra , especially given the uncertainties ( @xmath176dex ) in the emission line  radio correlation . if the line happens to fall in a region of the spectrum where noise is higher ( at the position of a subtracted telluric emission line , for example )",
    ", the s / n would be lower still .",
    "dust , if present in the source , would also reduce the predicted fluxes , and hence the s / n . source a  has the steepest radio spectrum of our candidates , so is most similar to classical hzrgs , and remains a good candidate for future spectroscopy .",
    "as discussed above , source b  may have prominent emission lines , and spectroscopic observations would also be worthwhile .    the photometric redshifts and `` typical '' hzrg  morphologies",
    "support the interpretation of these objects as hzrgs  ( and their deduced radio luminosities and @xmath153-band absolute magnitudes are agn - like , as expected ) . at the fainter radio flux levels we probe , we seem to be seeing the more `` normal '' members of the hzrg  population that perhaps make up the bulk of the luminosity function at these redshifts . indeed , comparing to the results of @xcite",
    ", we find that our three @xmath2 galaxies ( with rest - frame @xmath29-band magnitudes @xmath177mag , as computed from the photometric redshifts in table  [ tab : pz ] ) ought to lie on the fr - i / fr - ii break ( @xmath178whz@xmath13  at these optical absolute magnitudes ) .    as a sanity check",
    ", we obtain a rough estimate of the space density of these objects by calculating the comoving volume covered by the 4.9  square degree  combined radio dataset , in the redshift range 1.21  4.97 ( the range of photometric redshifts in table  [ tab : pz ] ) . in our chosen cosmology , this volume is @xmath179mpc@xmath180 . since we do not claim to have exhaustively studied the radio - loud optically - faint galaxy population in this field within this redshift range , the resulting space density for our four hzrg  candidates of @xmath181mpc@xmath182 should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "this compares favorably with the lower limit on radio galaxies of similar radio power ( @xmath183whz@xmath13 ) but steeper spectral index ( @xmath184 ) obtained by @xcite , @xmath185mpc@xmath182 at @xmath186 . since only one out of four of our hzrg  candidates has a spectral index as steep as this ( and since both estimates are lower limits ) , the space density is consistent with that measured by @xcite    deeper optical and / or ir observations ( particularly @xmath126 , @xmath159 and / or mid - ir ) would provide better constraints on our photometric redshifts .",
    "as discussed above , our objects may be only marginally too faint to be detected in our lris observations , so it is possible that deeper ( red - sensitive ) 10 m spectroscopy could in future provide spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "mid - ir observations would also be of interest in constraining star - formation rates , and the presence and temperature of any dust in these objects .",
