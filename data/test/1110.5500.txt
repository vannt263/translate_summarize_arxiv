    "quenched disorder induces an extrinsic inhomogeneity in otherwise translationally invariant pure systems . as a result",
    ", the equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium physics of disordered systems may be influenced by rare collective events , such as `` avalanches '' , statistically unlikely regions , such as `` droplets '' or `` griffiths regions '' , and by the proliferation of `` metastable states '' .",
    "our objective is to develop a theory describing the long - distance physics of such systems through a nonperturbative functional renormalization group ( np - frg ) method and our first focus is the equilibrium behavior of the random - field model .",
    "we showed in previous papers , which we refer to as i@xcite and ii@xcite , that the effect of avalanches and droplets can be captured by an approach based on the rg flow of the cumulants of the renormalized disorder , provided that the full functional dependence of the latter is accounted for.@xcite a functional rg is therefore required to let the singular behavior due to rare events or regions emerge along the flow , as also shown in the case of the equilibrium and forced behavior of manifolds in a random environment.@xcite    the issue of metastable states , which , at zero temperature where the concept is well defined , refers to the presence of many minima of the microscopic hamiltonian ( bare action ) not simply related by symmetry transformations , is a recurring conundrum in theories of disordered systems . in the case of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) under study , it has a clear manifestation .",
    "the critical behavior of the model being controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point,@xcite the long - distance physics can be described through the properties of the ground state which , due to the presence of the random field , is obtained as the solution of a stochastic field equation . by standard field - theoretic manipulations",
    ", this leads to a theory expressed in terms of superfields .",
    "parisi and sourlas@xcite showed that a supersymmetry of the theory , more specifically the invariance under rotations of the underlying superspace , implies the property of dimensional reduction , according to which the critical behavior of the rfim in @xmath4 dimensions is identical to that of the pure ising model in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "the property however has been proven to be wrong in low enough dimension.@xcite at the same time , it has been understood that the superfield construction breaks down because of the presence of many solutions of the stochastic field equation.@xcite however , in the parisi - sourlas formalism , it is not possible to disentangle breaking of superrotational invariance and collapse of the formalism due to the appearance of multiple solutions .    in the companion paper , henceforth referred to as paper iii,@xcite we have shown how to resolve the above conundrum and to combine an extended superfield approach with the np - frg formalism .",
    "in particular , ground - state selection can be achieved by adding a weighting factor involving an auxiliary temperature and letting at the end of the manipulations the auxiliary temperature go to zero in the exact np - frg equations for the cumulants of the renormalized disorder .",
    "the resulting property of `` grassmannian ultralocality '' then allows one to specifically investigate supersymmetry ( superrotational invariance ) and its spontaneous breaking along the rg flow .",
    "such an investigation is the purpose of the present paper .    the outline of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly summarize the main steps of the np - frg in a superfield formalism that we have developed in paper iii .",
    "this allows us to recall definitions , notations , and rg equations that will be used in the present article .",
    "in particular , we stress two important , and distinct , formal properties of the superfield theory :  grassmannian ultralocality \" and  superrotational invariance \" .",
    "we also consider the rg flow of the ward - takahashi identities associated with the latter and the consequences for the choice of the infrared regulator . in sec .",
    "[ sec : surot invariance ] , we show through our np - frg formalism that the superrotational invariance nonperturbatively leads to dimensional reduction .",
    "we conclude the section by building a scenario for a spontaneous breaking of the superrotational invariance along the rg flow that is based on our previous results on the appearance of a  cusp \" in the functional dependence of the cumulants of the renormalized random field,@xcite and we propose a continuation of the np - frg flow equations when spontaneous breaking has taken place .",
    "[ sec : approximation scheme ] is devoted to the development of a supersymmetry - compatible nonperturbative approximation scheme for the exact np - frg equations .",
    "it relies on combined truncations of the cumulant expansion and the expansion in spatial derivatives of the field .",
    "we also provide details on the numerical resolution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results .",
    "we show in particular that breakdown of the dimensional reduction predictions for the critical exponents of the rfim occurs below a critical dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we compute the critical exponents as a function of dimension down to @xmath2 and we find good agreement with the best available estimates in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we show that scaling is described by three independent exponents , contrary to a proposed conjecture.@xcite    a short account of this work has appeared in ref .",
    "we start by briefly recalling the main features of the formalism presented in the preceding article , with the associated definitions and notations .    in paper",
    "iii,@xcite we have developed a np - frg theory for describing the equilibrium long - distance physics of the rfim that is based on an extension of the parisi - sourlas@xcite supersymmetric formalism .",
    "the latter relies on the fact that the critical behavior of the model is dominated by disorder - induced fluctuations , thermal fluctuations being subdominant , and can therefore be studied by looking directly at zero temperature .",

    "i.e. _ the flow obtained by setting @xmath469 [ _ e.g. _ @xmath470 .",
    "this flow no longer depends on the second derivative of the associated function with respect to the field .",
    "however , this diffusive - like term [ @xmath471 in our previous example ] is very important to stabilize the numerical integration . in practice ,",
    "when necessary , we have therefore added by hand a small diffusive contribution to the flow equations and checked that the numerical results are stable under varying the strength of these extra terms .",

    "griffiths phases \" is however unlikely to be captured by such an approach . in this case",
    "the rare regions that are involved are exponentially suppressed as their size increases and produce very weak ( essential ) singularities in the thermodynamics .",
    "such a behavior does not show up easily once the average over disorder has been performed , as done in the cumulants .",
    "droplets on the other hand are `` power - law rare '' regions in their size and have a clear signature in the functional dependence of the cumulants of the renormalized disorder ( see _ e.g. _ the detailed work by balents and ledoussal on the random manifold model.@xcite ) the same is true for  avalanches \" , which are collective discontinuous events occurring in _ typical _ samples at zero temperature for exceptional values of the applied source .",
    "we define `` supercusp '' , `` cusp '' , and `` subcusp '' in @xmath472 according to the order of the nonanalyticity in @xmath473 when @xmath402 : @xmath474 corresponds to a supercusp , @xmath475 to a `` cusp '' , and @xmath419 a noninteger @xmath476 to a subcusp .",
    "a `` linear cusp '' is associated with @xmath477 .",
    "this can be generalized to higher - order cumulants of the renormalized random field .",
    "note that there does not seem to be any alternative route , for instance by introducing new sources conjugate to operators that break susy explicitly.we have not found any useful additional wt identities when the invariance under superrotations is broken . to check this ,",
    "we have followed zinn - justin s procedure,@xcite which amounts to performing transformations on the action and adding sources to the new generated independent operators . however , introducing new operators to compensate for the terms breaking susy breaks additional symmetries , including rotations in euclidean subspace , and an increasing number of independent operators are generated at each new iteration of the procedure .",
    "if one also wishes to describe microscopic details associated with a specific definition of the bare action and keep a finite uv cutoff @xmath40 , one has to generalize the function @xmath277 to @xmath478 , with @xmath479 when @xmath480 and @xmath481 ; a possible choice of @xmath482 is @xmath483 where @xmath484 is the heaviside step function .",
    "when @xmath485 for @xmath147 fixed , the infrared cutoff function @xmath486 diverges as @xmath487 whereas @xmath488 goes to @xmath489 , which fulfills the requirements described in paper iii.@xcite    the constraint of no explicit susy breaking and the associated wt identities are not easily implemented in other approximation schemes .",
    "for instance one could envisage to replace the derivative expansion by a more powerful scheme to describe the full momentum dependence of the proper vertices , as proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] . however , it is not obvious then to combine this approximation with the expansion in cumulants .",
    "note that if the bare random field is not gaussian distributed , one can not bluntly neglect all higher - order cumulants .",
    "one should then check that , as expected , the non - gaussian behavior that is present at the bare level does not change the long - distance physics . to assess this point",
    ", it is necessary to include in the description at least the third cumulant and then consider the next order of the approximation scheme .",
    "when @xmath317 , one anticipates a subcusp in @xmath490 as @xmath491 , with no implication for the dimensional reduction .",
    "numerically however , it is very hard to find evidence for such subcusps as this would involve computing high orders in the derivatives with respect to the fields : for instance , one should be able to follow the fourth derivative of @xmath214 with respect to @xmath114 and check for its divergence at the fixed point above @xmath262 .",
    "one can also check that the `` magnetic - field eigenvalue '' @xmath492 corresponding to the relevant direction associated with odd eigenfunctions in the field arguments is analytically obtained in any dimension as @xmath493 , which as expected is the dimension of the fields ; the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath494 , @xmath495 , and @xmath496 are expressed in terms of the fixed - point functions , namely : @xmath497 , @xmath498 , and @xmath499 ."
