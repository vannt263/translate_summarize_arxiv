    "during the last decade , several observational probes @xcite have confirmed that our universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . beyond the details of specific models ,",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects of such a discovery is the seemingly unavoidable presence of a new tiny mass scale in the theory that describes our world .    in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , a negative pressure component ( `` dark energy ''  @xcite )",
    "can account for the cosmic acceleration . during the cosmological expansion ,",
    "such a component has to become dominant when the average energy density @xmath0 drops to about its present value @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the proper time ) .",
    "thus , dark energy lagrangians typically contain a mass parameter of the order of @xmath3 , that triggers the epoch when dark energy starts to dominate .",
    "models of massive / modified gravity highlight the problem from a different perspective .",
    "if the graviton is effectively massive , the modified dynamics of gravity at large distances can provide a mechanism for  self - acceleration \" @xcite and/or of filtering for the cosmological constant s zero mode  @xcite . in that case",
    "the new mass brought into the theory is the mass of the graviton , @xmath4 , typically of order the hubble constant @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 . in @xmath7 theories of gravity , where the lagrangian density @xmath8 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath9 ,",
    "the late - time acceleration is realized , again , by introducing a curvature scale @xmath10 of the order of @xmath11  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "note that , although based on different mechanisms , all models follow an analogous pattern : there is a tuned scale  hidden \" in the theory which becomes effective ,  by coincidence \" , when the appropriate cosmological quantity ( the average density @xmath0 or the hubble parameter @xmath12 ) drops to about its value .    but is the acceleration of the universe intrinsically implying the presence of a new mass scale ? if we allow the possibility of departures from gr at large distances there is a logical alternative .",
    "high redshift observations have the unique property of relating objects ( e.g. , the observer and the supernova ) that are placed from each other at a relative distance of the order of the average inverse curvature ( roughly , the hubble length @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , modifying gr in the infrared ( ir ) at a length scale set by the curvature  rather than fixed _ a priori _ by a parameter  will systematically affect any cosmological observation at high redshift , regardless of when such an observation takes place and without the need of any external mass scale .",
    "in other words , we might not need a new mass scale because we already have ( a dynamical ) one , the hubble parameter @xmath12 ; the only  coincidence \" that we might be experiencing is that of observing objects that are placed from us as far as the hubble radius , where @xmath14 is the distance from the sun . ] .",
    "the point of view sketched above is somewhat compelling , it addresses directly the fine tuning and coincidence problems , but seems to require a serious revision of the current low energy framework for gravity .",
    "any gravitational operator that becomes effective in the infrared , on dimensional grounds , has to bring in the lagrangian a mass parameter .",
    "moreover , gr itself is already a geometrical deformation of flat space at distances of the order of the curvature .",
    "what seems to be required is a further curvature - dependent subleading effect that systematically modifies the geometrical description of gr at large distances .",
    "recently , a proposal along those lines has been made by one of the present authors .",
    "the modification upon the standard framework is forced by imposing an  ultra strong \" version of the equivalence principle ( usep , see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "usep suggests that the usual geometric description of spacetime as a metric riemannian manifold might hold only approximately , at small distances .",
    "such a conjectured  ir - completion \" of gravity , in its full generality , represents a major theoretical challenge .",
    "however , it can be tentatively explored with a taylor expansion around gr , by applying usep to a specific gr solution ( see appendix [ sketch ] ) . for a spectator scalar field in a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , the first - order correction to gr is calculable , and few cosmological consequences are derivable  @xcite .",
    "consider , as the zeroth - order ( gr- ) approximation , a homogeneous , spatially flat flrw universe with scale factor @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that in such a solution the physical distance @xmath16 between a pair of comoving observers grows proportionally to @xmath15 ; otherwise stated , the comoving distance @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "the first - order correction found in ref .",
    "@xcite modifies such an expansion law by a subleading distance - dependent contribution . as a result ,",
    "the distance @xmath16 between two comoving observers grows as @xmath15 only when small compared to the hubble length @xmath18 but gets relevant corrections otherwise .",
    "thus , the scale factor @xmath15 defines the expansion everywhere but only in the local limit , and effectively detaches from the expansion on the largest scales .",
    "the corrected expansion is most easily seen in terms of the above defined comoving distance @xmath19 , which is constant only in the small distance limit .",
    "its derivative with respect to observers proper time @xmath2 reads  @xcite @xmath20 and is clearly negligible on sub - hubble scales . for completeness , a basic derivation of eq .",
    "( [ dotlamre ] ) is sketched in appendix  [ sketch ] .",
    "the comoving trajectory @xmath21 of a light ray also receives corrections because the modified global expansion ( [ dotlamre ] ) has to be considered on top of the usual contribution @xmath22 . in a matter - dominated universe , where the hubble parameter at the redshift @xmath23 is given by @xmath24",
    ", we have @xmath25 which has to be solved with initial conditions @xmath26 .    the above modification , including the factor of @xmath27 ,",
    "is forced by requiring that usep applies for a scalar field in a spatially flat flrw universe  @xcite .",
    "the correction increases the luminosity distance @xmath28 and therefore it effectively goes in the direction of a universe with positive acceleration .",
    "however , as the present analysis shows as a by - product , the correction given in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ redshift ] ) is too small ( of too high order in the redshift ) to explain snia data",
    ".    equation ( [ redshift ] ) is an example of a ir - geometrical deformation that does not contain any mass scale but only @xmath29-dependent subleading terms . in this paper , by studying a generalized version of ( [ redshift ] ) , we attempt to address quantitatively the question whether snia data can be explained without introducing any new mass scale .",
    "we include terms of lower order in the redshift that are needed to efficiently reproduce snia observations . equation ( [ dotlamre ] ) is generalized as follows : @xmath30 note that the above structure of corrections includes ( [ dotlamre ] ) as a special case . in practice , the terms in the above expansion rearrange when we calculate the luminosity distance .",
    "therefore , for a matter - dominated universe , a quite general structure of subleading terms is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a generic function with @xmath33 : @xmath34 by comparison with ( [ dotlam ] ) we have @xmath35 note that eq .",
    "( [ redshift ] ) corresponds to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while in gr all coefficients are set to zero .",
    "it is possible to obtain analytic solutions of ( [ ode ] ) in some restricted cases ( e.g. , @xmath38 , see appendix [ appendixsec ] ) .",
    "however , it is perhaps more useful to study the effective behavior of ( [ ode ] ) at low @xmath39 . in order to make an easy comparison with known parameterizations of dark energy",
    ", we can easily express our first two parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in terms of an effective density parameter @xmath42 and a _ constant _ effective equation of state @xmath43 of dark energy , in the presence of non - relativistic matter instead of constant @xmath44 .",
    "however the corresponding expression in this case is much more complicated , so we will not present it here . ] .",
    "such effective parameters  @xcite are thus defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 by expanding eq .",
    "( [ rzreal ] ) at small redshift we find @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ , \\dots \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the solution of ( [ ode ] ) can be expanded as @xmath48 by comparing  ( [ series2 ] ) and  ( [ series1 ] ) we can relate the two sets of parameters : @xmath49 \\omega_{\\rm de}^{\\rm eff}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath50cdm model ( @xmath51 ) with @xmath52 it follows that @xmath53 , @xmath54 . of course",
    "the above expansions are valid only for @xmath55 , so it is expected that the likelihood analysis including high - redshift data can give different constraints on the model parameters ( as we will see later ) .    the most important correction that leads to a larger comoving distance relative to the einstein de sitter universe originates from the @xmath40 term in eqs .  ( [ ode])-([ode2 ] ) , i.e. , the term @xmath56 in eq .  ( [ dotlam ] ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath57 , the correction @xmath58 becomes important only for the terms higher than order @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ series1 ] ) .",
    "hence , we expect that eq .",
    "( [ redshift ] ) alone will not be sufficient to reproduce snia data efficiently , at least at low redshift .",
    "in this section we shall present a method to place observational constraints on the ir corrections ( [ ode])-([ode2 ] ) from snia data . we will use the snia dataset of hicken _ et al . _",
    "@xcite consisting in total of 397 snia out of which 100 come from the new cfa3 sample and the rest from kowalski _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "these observations provide the apparent magnitude @xmath61 of the snia at peak brightness after implementing the correction for galactic extinction , the k - correction and the light curve width - luminosity correction .",
    "the resulting apparent magnitude @xmath61 is related to the luminosity distance @xmath62 through @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the magnitude zero point offset and depends on the absolute magnitude @xmath65 and on the present hubble parameter @xmath5 as @xmath66 here the absolute magnitude @xmath65 is assumed to be constant after the above mentioned corrections have been implemented in @xmath61 .",
    "the snia datapoints are given , after the corrections have been implemented , in terms of the distance modulus @xmath67 the theoretical model parameters are determined by minimizing the quantity @xmath68 ^ 2 } { \\sigma_{\\mu \\ ; i}^2}\\ , , \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the errors due to flux uncertainties , intrinsic dispersion of snia absolute magnitude and peculiar velocity dispersion .",
    "these errors are assumed to be gaussian and uncorrelated .",
    "the theoretical distance modulus is defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is given by eq .",
    "( [ mug ] ) .",
    "the steps we have followed for the minimization of eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) in terms of its parameters are described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will also use the two information criteria known as aic ( akaike information criterion ) and bic ( bayesian information criterion ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references there in .",
    "the aic is defined as = -2_max+2k , [ aic ] where the likelihood is defined as @xmath74 , the term @xmath75 corresponds to the minimum @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the number of parameters of the model .",
    "the bic is defined similarly as = -2_max+k n , [ bic ] where @xmath78 is the number of datapoints in the set under consideration . according to these criteria a model with the smaller aic / bic",
    "is considered to be the best and specifically , for the bic a difference of 2 is considered as positive evidence , while 6 or more as strong evidence in favor of the model with the smaller value .",
    "similarly , for the aic a difference in the range @xmath79 means that the two models have about the same support from the data as the best one , for a difference in the range @xmath80 this support is considerably less for the model with the larger aic , while for a difference @xmath81 the model with the larger aic practically irrelevant @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath97 derived from the second of eqs .",

    "@xcite , i.e. eq .  ( [ redshift ] ) , corresponds to @xmath36 , @xmath99 . in this case , however , the agreement is not very good as the @xmath76 per degree of freedom is @xmath100 with the difference from the @xmath50cdm model being about @xmath101 .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the ir correction does not kick in early enough to allow for good compatibility with the data , while in low redshifts the scdm behavior of the model dominates .",
    "this latter property comes from the fact that the @xmath58-dependent term appears only at the order of @xmath102 in eq .",

    "we have considered ir modifications of gravity that do not imply the presence of a new mass scale in the theory and we have studied their compatibility with the snia data .",
    "our first result is that the mechanism derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also appendix [ sketch ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ dotlamre ] ) , is not enough , by itself , to describe the observed amount of acceleration .",
    "the absence of free parameters in equation ( [ dotlamre ] ) ( the model in  @xcite has one parameter less than @xmath50cdm ) does not make up for the very poor fit of the data .",
    "however , a more general structure of corrections ( [ dotlam ] ) can lead to a sensibly larger luminosity distance than in the einstein de sitter universe . in particular , when @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ ode])-([ode2 ] ) , we have found that the model fits the data very well for the values close to the exact numbers @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to consider such sharp numerical values , not because of abstract numerology , but because a mechanism analogous to that described in appendix  [ sketch ] very naturally produces coefficients which are integers or simple fractions .    at present",
    "it is not clear if the corrections that one finds by applying usep to a field automatically apply to , or are inherited by , other types of fields .",
    "the suggested luminosity distance may eventually turn out to be produced by considering other fields than the scalar field considered in  @xcite or by means of other theoretical insights .",
    "we also considered the full three parameters model ( [ ode])-([ode2 ] ) , whose best fit considerably improves the @xmath76 and is found to be favored over @xmath50cdm by the aic but not by the bic criterion .",
    "it should be noted that the parameters that we are fitting are not coupling constants , and do not appear in a lagrangian .",
    "rather , they are intended as the terms of a series expansion that approximate the new  ir - completed \" theory starting from gr . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the proposed deformation is present at any time during the cosmological evolution ; it affects any cosmological observation at high redshift , regardless of when such an observation takes place , and therefore addresses the  coincidence problem \" in the most direct way .",
    "we note that our model requires a rather low value of the hubble constant , @xmath129km / s / mpc , compared to the constraint from the hubble key project with the determination of @xmath130km / s / mpc @xcite .",
    "this comes from the fact that the hubble parameter evolves as @xmath131 even for @xmath132 due to the absence of a dark energy component .",
    "however , methods of the determination of @xmath5 that are largely independent of distance scales of the large magellanic cloud cepheid typically give low values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "for example , reese _",
    "@xcite showed that sunyaev - zeldovich distances to 41 clusters provide the constraint @xmath133km / s / mpc in the einstein de sitter universe .",
    "thus the information of @xmath5 alone is not yet sufficient to rule out our model",
    ".    it would be interesting to see the effect of the proposed ir correction on the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and estimate the modification to the temperature anisotropies in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
