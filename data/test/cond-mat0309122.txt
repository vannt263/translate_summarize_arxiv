    "it is well accepted today that the fractional quantum hall effect results from the formation of a strongly correlated spin polarized electron liquid in the lowest landau level , that crystallizes below filling 1/7 @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing , however , that a mean field charge density wave solution exists at all fillings , called a hall crystal ( hc ) , which yields in a natural way the odd - denominator rule that characterizes the effect.@xcite the state is characterized by a unit cell that contains a fractional charge of even denominator , such as e/2 .",
    "the detailed investigation of this class of mean field states was stopped largely due to their higher energy than that of the liquid , and the very small correlation correction obtained by yoshioka and lee ( yl ) for the wigner solid ( ws ) , which accomodates one whole electron per plaquette.@xcite however , while in the latter case there is little overlap of electrons from neighboring cells , in the former the charge density forms continuous ridges between cells opening the way for an appreciable increase of the cohesive correlation energy.@xcite this idea was first explored in the simplest case of @xmath0 filling.@xcite the results confirmed the effect yielding a second order correlation correction an order of magnitude larger than for the best ws state . the same line of thinking was also recently considered by mikhailov.(@xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we report results for the correlation energy of the hc at @xmath1 filling .",
    "the work rests on an analytic solution of the mean field problem constructde using symmetry considerations .",
    "we show that the electron - electron interaction breaks the single particle degeneracy of the lowest landau level ( lll ) , splitting it into three remarkably flat bands .",
    "all bands contain the same number of states so that only one is filled while the other two are empty , separated by a large gap . while the hc unit cell traps 3/2 flux quanta of the original field , it is only pierced by one flux quanta of the reduced field @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fields at @xmath1 and @xmath0 filling factor , respectively .",
    "the narrowness of the occupied band and this latter fact suggest that the magnetic wannier states are approximate solutions of the problem and behave as nearly free quasiparticles filling the lll of the effective field @xmath5 much as the composite fermion model predicts.@xcite    we compute the correlation energy using the yl method , that is , evaluating the second order perturbation correction to the hartree - fock ( hf ) solution .",
    "two methods are used , one employing a monte carlo approach for the space integrals over a large sample , and the other by computing in a discrete momentum space using a set defined by periodic boundary conditions applied to a comparatively small sample . as for the half filling case ,",
    "both methods yield an energy correction of about 10% , an order of magnitude larger than that for the ws state@xcite , confirming the earlier conjecture that at all fillings the high electron overlap of the hc enhances significantly the cohesive energy corrections@xcite , thus re - opening the case for this state as the proper precursor in a first principles perturbative approach to the true gound state of the system in the thermodynamic limit . one further outcome of our calculations is that over 50 particles would be required in order to approach convergence , way above current permissible sizes used in first principles numerical evaluations normally performed with up to 12 particles , number that has been extended to treat at most 27 particles @xcite .",
    "this may be understood again looking at the large inter cell overlap through hexagonal ridges , which seems to point out the importance of cooperative ring exchange effects in the system.@xcite to be operative , these need large sample sizes and would be missed by such numerical diagonalizations of the hamiltonian . if the true ground state retains the essential features of its hf approximation , then one would expect the hall crystal to be the proper mean field precursor due to its higher correlation energy than other mean field solutions.@xcite    in sec .",
    "2 the single particle hartree - fock hamiltonian is diagonalized analytically .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the second order correction os the mean field solution .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "details of the calculation are given in appendices a - d .",
    "in particular , in appendix b a formula is derived expressing the single particle hartree - fock hamiltonian in terms of the magnetic translations associated to an arbitrary periodicity lattice of the  hf  problem .",
    "this formula , up to our knowledge , is absent in the literature .",
    "we consider a 2deg in a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we are interested in an analytic treatment of the hartree - fock problem at filling 1/3 .",
    "we start out by writing the hartree - fock hamiltonian in the compact form    @xmath7    where the coefficients @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the background dielectric constant .",
    "the magnetic translation operators t are defined in appendix a , while form ( 1 ) is derived in appendix b. the particle density in real space @xmath11 is assumed to be periodic under displacements covering the triangular lattice defined by the vectors @xmath12 the fourier components of the density@xmath13are defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit cell area @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a unit vector normal to the electron gas plane . through this cell",
    "traverse a flux @xmath18 in units of the magnetic flux quantum @xmath19 .",
    "associated with the above real space lattice is the reciprocal lattice @xmath20      we next show that it is possible to find a basis in which the matrix representation of ( 1 ) has a diagonal form composed of simple 3-dimensional blocks . in addition , the functions have such a structure that they automatically furnish the translation symmetry of the total density over the lattice ( 2 ) . for this purpose",
    "we consider the basis functions @xmath21defined in appendix a , constructed over the lattice with primitive vectors @xmath22 the magnetic translations then have the form @xmath23 since the flux piercing the unit cell of the lattice ( 2 ) is not an integral number of flux quanta , the set of translation operators obtained by varying the integers @xmath24and @xmath25 in ( [ trans ] ) do not commute and it is not possible to find common eigenfunctions to all of them .",
    "the basis we shall construct decomposes in a set of three dimensional subspaces , closing each of them under the action of translations for all values of @xmath26 .",
    "a first step in finding the basis is to define a set of eigenfunctions of a translation in the vector @xmath27 which is a period of the density . for a given value of the momentum @xmath28 such orbitals",
    "may be written as @xmath29 using the formulas in appendix a it can be readily proven that these functions satisfy the eigenvalue relation @xmath30 the two values of @xmath31 appearing in these equations will play an important role in what follows .",
    "they will allow us to impose the periodicity of the density under the shifts in @xmath32 and @xmath27 in spite of the impossibility of obtaining a basis of eigenvectors of all the magnetic translations in the lattice .",
    "it should be stressed that the range of values of @xmath28 defining independent functions in the new basis have been reduced in half , the two values of @xmath31 compensating for this reduction .",
    "the restriction comes from the singular property of the basis @xmath33 that a magnetic translation is fully equivalent to a shifting of the momenta argument as implied by the relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a pure phase factor .",
    "see appendix a and ref ( 16 ) for the justification of this relation .",
    "it directly implies that the shift done in @xmath36 in constructing the new basis precisely changes the momentum @xmath28 of the particle in @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , what has been basically done is to form linear combinations of the original functions associated with different values of the momentum . in the new basis",
    "the magnetic translation in @xmath32 has the simple effect @xmath38 that is , it merely changes the sign of @xmath31 and multiplies it by a phase factor .    as the next step",
    "let us employ the fact that , although the functions are not eigenvectors of translations in @xmath32 , they are eigenfunctions of the double sized translations in @xmath39 . this is because its effect , when considered as two consecutive shifts in @xmath40 have the simple result of making two consecutive changes of sign of @xmath31 that reproduce the original function .",
    "therefore , if for @xmath28 and @xmath41 fixed we construct the triplet of states formed by the function @xmath42 and the other two obtained by a pair of successive translations in the vector -@xmath43 , the operation of performing a translation in an arbitrary multiple of these vectors leaves the triplets invariant .",
    "a specific linear combination within each triplet which is also an eigenfunction of the translation in -@xmath43 can be obtained by constructing the new basis @xmath44 after solving the linear equations for the constants @xmath45 obtained by imposing the condition that these functions be solutions of the eigenvalue problem @xmath46 one finds @xmath47 substituting in ( [ functions ] ) yields @xmath48 the last relation expresses that , modulo a phase factor , the states of the new basis are equivalent upon a shift of their momenta @xmath28 in any linear combination with integer coefficients of half the unit cell vectors of the reciprocal lattice corresponding to the periodicity of the density .",
    "the periodicity of the states under the shifts in @xmath49 was discussed above , and the one related with @xmath50 similarly follows from the relation ( [ phase ] ) in appendix a , expressing the equivalence of a magnetic translation with a shift in momentum .",
    "the functions just defined have an alternative and more compact form given by @xmath51 where the effective momenta and the new elementary lattice of vectors @xmath52 over which the sum is performed are given by @xmath53 the double sum ( [ altern ] ) can be evaluated to obtain an explicit formula in terms of the elliptic theta functions as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55    let us inspect now the action of a magnetic translation by @xmath56 on the new functions .",
    "if such a transformation leaves the triplets invariant , then the matrix reduction of the hartree - fock hamiltonian will follow .",

    "they fix the wave - functions of the filled band and the empty bands as @xmath70 here @xmath71 labels the filled band in each triplet and @xmath72 label the two empty bands .      in order to proceed within an analytical context",
    "let us consider the observation from former numerical studies , that the particle density when the number of flux quanta piercing the unit cell is a half integer essentially vanishes at all lattice points.@xcite then , let us first assume that the density rigorously vanishes at this set of points .",
    "if so is the case , the wave - function of any of the filled states should then also vanish at those points .",
    "this requirement follows from the fact that the hartree - fock particle density is a sum over the individual densities of all occupied orbitals ,    @xmath73    we can then use this property to fix the coefficients of the wave functions within each triplet .    after imposing the vanishing conditions at the origin , the coefficients defining the functions ( [ solution ] ) are fully determined and",
    "take the form @xmath74 note that the coefficients @xmath75 are all independent of @xmath31 .",
    "this completes the definition of our functions .",
    "that they are true solutions of the hartree - fock problem is proven in appendix c.    the particle density may now be computed replacing these functions in eq .",
    "( [ charge ] ) . the real space particle density thus obtained",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : densi ] .",
    "a main property to be noticed in this figure is the formation of sharp hexagonal channels surrounding the low density regions at the center of which the vanishing density occurs .",
    "these structures mark the difference with the wigner solid whose unit cell encloses one flux quanta .",
    "the charge density in this latter instance is made up essentially of well localized gaussians centered at each lattice point . in our case there is strong overlap , suggesting that cooperative ring exchange involving many unit cells is a large contribution to the correlation energy .",

    "( [ poten ] ) and ( [ heigen ] ) , allows for the evaluation of the one particle spectrum of the system .",
    "as it was expected , three energy bands appear , each associated with a value of the index r and covering the full range of @xmath28 within each triplet .",
    "we also note that states associated with @xmath76 turn out to be degenerate .",
    "the bands dispersion relations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .",
    "note the narrowness of the bands as compared with the gaps separating them .",
    "this fact leads to the idea that in this mean field approximation the coulomb interaction , although breaking the degeneracy of the first landau level , it reorganizes the states in three equally populated separate sets that again are aproximately degenerate , as if they were landau levels of a renormalized problem . since at 1/3 filling one band",
    "is full and the other two empty , one expects the electrons to behave dynamically similarly to filling one , except for a different effective mass , as the composite fermion model suggests.@xcite the magnetic wannier states are expected to be approximate solutions , playing the role of the angular momentum states in the non - interacting problem at filling one .",
    "these properties seem to corroborate the possibility of tracing a link between weakly interacting composite fermions and the bloch or wannier orbitals in the mean field solutions considered earlier by one of us.@xcite to finish this section we note that the mean field energy per particle obtained from the above formalism for the solution we have constructed confirms the value reported in an earlier numerical computation,@xcite @xmath77",
    "in order to obtain the energy correction to second order of perturbation theory we proceed similarly as in ref ( 8) , starting with the expression@xcite    @xmath78    here @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the mean field slater determinant and total hartree - fock energy associated with the ground state , respectively , and @xmath81 is the projection of the exact many particle hamiltonian onto the first landau level .",
    "the many particle excited states @xmath82 are slater determinants constructed with the basis ( [ solution ] ) , mixing states in the filled band with states in the empty bands .",
    "it follows that @xmath83 , a property that allowed to write the last equality in ( [ foryosh ] ) . in the second quantized representation",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath81 will have non - vanishing matrix elements linking the hf state and excited states of the form @xmath84 only , where @xmath85 creates an electron of quantum numbers @xmath86 , etc .",
    "the index @xmath87 is a shorthand notation for the set of two pairs of filled @xmath88 and empty ( @xmath89 ) electron states , where @xmath90 and @xmath91are the set of all states in the landau level and the filled ones , respectively .",

    "we can use this property to simplify the calculation of the energy correction .",
    "first , we approximate the filled band energies appearing in the denominator of ( [ e2 ] ) by their mean value , @xmath108 in addition , and slightly more crudely , we substitute the energies in the excited bands by a common energy equal to half the sum of the mean energies of the two bands , @xmath109 this last approximation is taken in view of the small relative gap separating these two bands .    with this simplifying substitution ( [ e2 ] )",
    "can be expressed in the simpler form @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the projection operator on the subspace of states of the filled band and @xmath112 the projector associated to the subspace of states formed with the union of the empty bands .",
    "the projectors have the following expression in terms of the corresponding densities @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the ordinary kronecker delta and @xmath115is the projection operator onto the first landau level , defined in appendix a. these expressions can be obtained from formula ( [ onepart ] ) in appendix b. after evaluating a few spatial integrals , the following formula for the correlation energy per particle @xmath116 is obtained @xmath117    further progress in the evaluation of the energy correction is aided by noting the presence of an exponential factor in the squared fourier wave - vectors , allowing to take just a few of them only , for sufficient convergence .",

    "( 16 ) that the basis functions are completely independent of an arbitrary change in the  seed  for any other function in the first landau level .",

    "the arguments of these operators are spatial vectors determined by the reciprocal lattice associated with the fourier components of the density .",

    "the definition of the one - particle density matrix in terms of the slater determinant @xmath251 can be transformed by performing a simultaneous magnetic translation operation in a vector @xmath63 of the periodic lattice over all the particle coordinates . since this is assumed to be a symmetry transformation of the system",

    "it now transforms under spatial shifts as @xmath256 therefore , the function    @xmath257 is fully periodic in the variable @xmath258 under the lattice shifts .",
    "that is @xmath259 then , fourier expanding @xmath260  leads to the following expression for @xmath261    @xmath262 where    @xmath263    further , let us consider the density written as the sum @xmath264 and the fact that each @xmath265 in the lower landau level can be expanded as a linear combination of the complete basis functions@xmath266 defined over a lattice with one flux quantum per unit cell.@xcite then , a generic term in the integral in ( [ elele ] ) has the form @xmath267 since the function @xmath172 is a gaussian , its magnetic translations ( [ magntra ] ) have also this character , and thus the integrals in ( [ elele ] ) can be calculated explicitly .",

    "we now consider the exchange term ( [ exchange ] ) . using the above results the integrals in    @xmath271",
    "can be calculated  explicitly . for this purpose ,",
    "let us consider again the integral of a generic term @xmath272 in the sum over @xmath189 defining the functions @xmath194 .",
    "the integral for this term is then reduced to two simple integrals , which after some algebra can be explicitly evaluated to obtain @xmath273 henceforth , after adding all terms for different values of @xmath274 follows @xmath275 using the independence and completeness of the basis formed by the @xmath276 s in the first landau level , we thus obtain @xmath277 combining this results and the previous one ( [ directterm ] ) the following representation for the one - particle hartree - fock hamiltonian in the first landau level follows ,    @xmath278    with the coefficients defined by    @xmath279",

    "but the two components @xmath291 are linear combinations of the rising and lowering operators which transform functions of a landau level in functions of the higher and lower contiguous levels . therefore , the projection onto the first landau level of the fourier component can be obtained by simply omitting the operator @xmath287 in the above formula .",

    "let us inspect further the commutation properties of the projected density operator . using the representation of the single particle hamiltonian in terms of the magnetic translations found in appendix b and the relations @xmath300 it follows that    @xmath301   & = & \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}% ^{*}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{y}^{*}}u\\text{(}\\mathbf{x}^{*})\\left [ t_{\\mathbf{x}% ^{*}},t_{\\mathbf{y}^{*}}\\right ]   \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}^{*}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{z}^{*}}u\\text{(}\\mathbf{x}^{*})(\\exp ( % \\frac{ie}{\\hbar c}\\mathbf{a(x^{*}).z}^{*})-\\exp ( -\\frac{ie}{\\hbar c}\\mathbf{% a(x^{*}).z}^{*}))t_{\\mathbf{z}^{*}}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    considering that @xmath302 is the coefficient of the superposition of translations giving the single particle hf hamiltonian which is a function of @xmath303 , and using the inversion symmetry of the solution under consideration @xmath302(@xmath304(-@xmath305 one finds @xmath306 = 0.\\ ] ] hence , acting with the hamiltonian on ( [ vanish ] ) and employing the definition of the projection operators and the periodic density operator it follows that    @xmath307    finally , taking into account that the set of functions @xmath308 for all values of the lattice ( [ perlatt ] ) are linearly independent @xcite , it follows that    @xmath309    in addition , since the coefficients of the linear combinations of the triplet functions for the two signs of @xmath31 are uniquely defined by the vanishing condition of the function at the origin ( or any point of the lattice @xmath63 ) , we have , @xmath310 where @xmath311 is here a normalization constant . finally , we obtain @xmath312 that is , the special functions that vanish at all latice points are eigenfunctions of the one particle hf hamiltonian .",
    "in this appendix we sketch the derivation of the formula ( [ e2alter ] ) employed in the evaluation of the sample size dependence of the correction to the energy per particle . as before",

    "after some algebra it is possible to obtain the expresion      where the summation vectors @xmath136 and the norm functions are defined as follows , @xmath319 and , as before , @xmath320 equals one when the arguments are same modulo vectors of the class @xmath136 defined above , and zero otherwise@xmath95 it is possible to show now that the ratio multiplying this latter function a simply a phase factor . for this purpose",
