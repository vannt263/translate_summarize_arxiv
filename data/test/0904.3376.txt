    "in recent years , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices have attracted enormous attention both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because the lattice parameters and interaction strength can be manipulated using a modern experimental technique . making use of this",
    ", researchers have discovered many long - predicted phenomena , for example non - linear landau - zener tunneling , energetic and dynamical instability and the strongly inhibited transport of one - dimensional bec in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "more attracting phenomena , namely , self - trapping , was recently observed experimentally in this system  @xcite . in such an experiment ,",
    "a bec cloud with repulsive interaction initially loaded in optical lattices was self - trapped .",
    "many theoretical analysis was also presented about self - trapping  @xcite .",
    "it is well know the macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) means self - maintained population imbalance with non - zero average value of the fractional population imbalance which was detailed discussed  @xcite .",
    "marino et .",
    "al . considered that the damping decays all different oscillations to the zero - phase mode  @xcite .",
    "besides , macroscopic quantum fluctuations have also been discussed by taking advantage of second - quantization approaches  @xcite . however , when the trapping potential is time dependent and the damping and finite - temperature effect can not be neglected , chaos emerges .",
    "abdullaev and kraenkel studied the nonlinear resonances and chaotic oscillation of the fractional imbalance between two coupled bec s in a double - well trap with a time - dependent tunneling amplitude for different damping  @xcite . when the asymmetry of the trap potential is time - dependent and its amplitude is so small that can be took as a perturbation , lee et al .",
    "studied the chaotic and frequency - locked atomic population oscillation between two coupled becs with a weak damping , and discovered that the system comes to an stationary frequency - locked atomic population oscillations from transient chaos  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that theoretical studies of stability are mainly focused on the effect of two - body interactions .",
    "it is clear that in low temperature and density , where interatomic distance is much greater than the distance scale of atom - atom interactions , two - body s - wave scattering should be important and three - body interactions can be neglected .",
    "but , if the atom density is higher , for example , in the case of bec in optical lattices , three - body interactions will play an important role  @xcite . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , even for a small strength of the three - body force , the region of stability for the condensate can be extended considerably .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to investigate the steady - state solution of bec in an one - dimensional periodic optical lattice when both the two - body and three - body interactions are taken into account . by using the mean - field approximation and linear stability theorem ,",
    "one interesting result is found that the tuning - fork bifurcation of steady - state relative population appears when the system parameters are changed to certain critical values .",
    "the existence of three - body interaction not only transforms the bifurcation point of the system but also affects greatly on the self - trapping behaviors of the system associated with the critically stable steady - state solutions .",
    "additionally , we also study the effects of the initial conditions , three - body interaction and the energy bias on the mqst .",
    "besides , we discuss the chaos behaviors of the system by applying the periodic modulation on the energy bias .",
    "the result shows the relative population oscillation can undergo a process from order to chaos , via a series of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the mean - field description of bec in optical lattices with two- and three - atom interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , with linear stability theorem , we analysis the stability of steady - state solutions .",
    "then the influences of three - body interaction on the macroscopic quantum self - trapping of the system are displayed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v , by applying the periodic modulation in the energy bias , we discuss chaotic behaviors of the system using the numerical simulation method . in the last section , summary and conclusion of our work are presented .",
    "we focus our attention on a bec with both two- and three - body interactions is subjected to one dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices where the motion in the perpendicular directions is confined . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the dynamics of bec can be modeled by the 1d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in the comoving frame of the lattice  @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave function of the condensate , @xmath2 is the mass of atoms , @xmath3 is the two - body s - wave scattering length , @xmath4 is the strength of the periodic potential , @xmath5 is the wave number of the laser light which is used to generate the optical lattice , @xmath6 stands for either the inertial force in the comoving frame of an accelerating lattice or the gravity force , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radial frequencies of the anisotropic harmonic trap , @xmath9 is three - body interactions related to the gp equation . among eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , all the variables can be rescaled to be dimensionless by the following system s basic parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we obtain the normalized 1d - gp equation in optical lattices with cubic and quintic nonlinearities , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective two - body interaction , @xmath13 is the total numbers of atoms , @xmath14 is the effective interaction among three atoms , here the three - body interaction is expected to be positive with a value of @xmath15 .    in the neighborhood of the brillouin zone edge @xmath16 ,",
    "the wave function can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the probability amplitudes of atoms in each of the two wells respectively and @xmath20 . by inserting such wave functions into eq .",
    "( [ 02 ] ) and performing some spatial integrals , we obtain the dynamical equations with two- and three - body interactions .",
    "@xmath21 here , the level bias @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the sweeping rate , @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the nonlinear parameters , @xmath26 is the coupling constant between the two condensates .",
    "we introduce the relative population variance @xmath27 with the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 combining eqs .",
    "( [ 04]-[07 ] ) , one yields the equations of the relative population and relative phase , @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the time derivative of the relative population and the relative phase . if we regard @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the canonically conjugate variables eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , become a pair of hamilton s canonical equations with the conserved effective hamiltonian @xmath36 in the following section , we will discuss the stability of steady - state in the symmetric condition ( @xmath37 ) with linear stability theorem .",
    "ii , we have given the dynamical equations of the system with three - body interaction . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the stability of steady - state in the symmetric condition .",
    "generally , there are two ways to study the stability of nonlinear system , the linear stability theorem and the lyapunov direct method .",
    "we will investigate the stability of the system with the first method .",
    "the steady - state solution of this system can be obtained by setting eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) to zero .",
    "the forms of steady - state solutions are very complicated when the level bias @xmath38 . for simplicity , we set @xmath39 , leading to @xmath40 and the conserved energy @xmath41 taking @xmath42 , @xmath43 , we get @xmath44 the steady - state solutions obeyed eqs .  ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) regard as @xmath45 @xmath46 according to the linear stability theorem , we look for the perturbed solutions which are near the steady - state solutions , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 signify the steady - state solutions , @xmath51 and @xmath52 which is relate to the first - order perturbed . inserting the above expression into eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , we can obtain the linear equations near to the steady - states of the nonlinear equations as @xmath53 @xmath54 now , we make use of the above expression to investigate the stability of the steady - states of eqs .",
    "( 16 - 18 ) .",
    "( 1)for @xmath55 , we can calculate the matrix elements @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "so , the coefficient matrix of the linearized equations ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) becomes @xmath60 $ ] such that the characteristic equation writes @xmath61=0 $ ] , which reveals that @xmath62 .",
    "we solve the equation to get the two eigenvalues of the matrix a as @xmath63 . in response to the forms of the eigenvalues , there exist two cases for the stabilities :    \\(a ) @xmath64 , that is @xmath65 @xmath66 so the two eigenvalues are both pure imaginary numbers .",
    "thus , the stability of the steady - state solutions @xmath67 corresponds to a critical case  @xcite and the dynamical bifurcations between the unstable and stable steady - states will appear when the parameters with two- and three - body interactions are changed .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath68 , namely @xmath69 @xmath70 so the two eigenvalues are real number .",
    "it means that @xmath71 and @xmath72 tend to infinity with the increase of time , and the steady - state solutions @xmath67 are unstable .",
    "( 2)for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , the matrix elements write as @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath77 become @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , there are two cases of the stabilities :    \\(a ) @xmath79 , that is @xmath80 so the two eigenvalues are both pure imaginary numbers . and the stability of the steady - state solutions @xmath81 of the nonlinear equations are reviewed as critical and the dynamical bifurcations will occur .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath82 , that is @xmath83 so the two eigenvalues are positive or negative real number , respectively .",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 tend to infinity as increasing the time to infinity , and the steady - state solutions @xmath81 are losing their stability .",
    "( 3)for @xmath84 , the matrix elements read @xmath56 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath59 , and the eigenvalues @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in eq .  (",
    "18 ) the population @xmath89 are both real quantities which implies @xmath90     are the steady - state solutions and the bifurcation point is @xmath91,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    therefore , the two eigenvalues are pure imaginary numbers . the stability of the steady - state solutions@xmath92 of the nonlinear equations are regarded as critical and the dynamical bifurcations will emerge at the bifurcation point @xmath93 , @xmath94 . obviously , the existence of three - body interaction can change the bifurcation point of the system .",
    "it plays a important role for stability analysis of the system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ p2 ] . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the system is in the critically stable steady - state ( @xmath96 ) , and for @xmath97 , ( @xmath96 ) is unstable and the two steady - state solutions ( @xmath98 ) are critically stable .",
    "this is a typical tuning - fork bifurcation , and the bifurcation point is @xmath91    according to the above analysis , we conclude that three steady - state solutions possess different stability for different parameter regions . and it is very interesting to arrive at the critically stable steady - state solution in experiment which relate to the stable stationary mqst  @xcite . in the following section , we will illustrate the mqst of the non - stationary states in detail by two different methods .",
    "in this section , we investigate the macroscopic quantum self - trapping by plotting the phase trajectories and the time evolution of the relative population of the system .      the macroscopic quantum self - trapping refers to the phase space trajectories whose the relative population is not equal zero .",
    "this can be well understood from the analysis eqs .",
    "( 8)-(10 ) , corresponding to the critically stable steady - state solutions discussed in sec.ii .",
    "three kinds of cases occur with different three - body interaction parameters , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "\\(1 ) in the case of @xmath99 in the phase space , there are two stable points @xmath100 at @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , from the circumstance described by eqs .",
    "( 22 ) and ( 26 ) . obviously , for the stable points @xmath103 , @xmath104 , the atoms distributions are equal in the two adjacent wells , the relative population of the trajectories around them is equal to @xmath105 .",
    "it means that atoms oscillate between two adjacent wells and the macroscopic quantum self - trapping phenomenon does not emerge in this case .",
    "\\(2 ) when parameter is set to @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , two more fixed points emerge in the line @xmath109 marked by @xmath110 , @xmath111 . among them , @xmath103 , @xmath112 are steady which is corresponding to condition of eq .",
    "they are located in @xmath113 , hence , @xmath114 is unstable point which lies in @xmath94 and corresponds to condition of eq.(26 ) . as seen from fig .",
    "2(b ) , for the stable points @xmath115 ,",
    "the atoms distributions are not equilibrium between two adjacent wells , and the relative population of the trajectories around them is not equal to @xmath105 .",
    "it indicates that atoms are self - trapped in one well .",
    "we take it as oscillating - phase - type because the relative population @xmath34 and the relative phase @xmath35 oscillate around the fixed points .",
    "to @xmath116(the first row ) .",
    "corresponding to in the second row we plot the energy profiles for the relative phase @xmath117 ( red dashed ) and @xmath109 ( blue solid),scaledwidth=100.0% ]    \\(3 ) for @xmath118 , @xmath119 , it emerges new trajectories , i.e.the trajectories across point @xmath120 [ fig .",
    "only the fixed point @xmath104 is stable which is relate to eq .",
    "so for these trajectories , @xmath34 varies with time from region of @xmath121 $ ] to @xmath122 $ ] , apparently @xmath123 , atoms are self - trapped in one well . we regard it as running - phase - type macroscopic quantum self - trapping , as described in refs .  @xcite and observed in experiment  @xcite .",
    "the above changes on the topological structure of the phase space are concerned with the change of the energy profile .",
    "when the relative phase is zero or @xmath124 , energy relying on the parameter with three - body interaction and the average population @xmath34 can be derived from eq .",
    "seeing fig .  2 , the transition from case(1)to case(2 ) corresponds to the bifurcation of the energy profile of @xmath109 : energy curve bifurcates from a single minimum to the curve of two minima .",
    "it means the system goes from the rabi regime into the self - trapping regime through this bifurcation .",
    "the lowest order of energy profile with @xmath117 is @xmath125 , and the energy of the unstable point @xmath114 is @xmath126 which is located on the maximal order of energy profile with @xmath109 .",
    "the results displayed by the phase space trajectories conform to the case of steady - state solutions discussed in sec.iii .",
    "the transition from case ( 2 ) to case(3 ) is signified by the overlap of the two energy regions of the profile . in this condition",
    "the trajectory stared from @xmath127 , @xmath117 should be confined to the lower half of phase plane , corresponding to the running - phase - type macroscopic quantum self - trapping .",
    "connecting the analysis of the steady - state solutions to the above analysis on the energy profile , it concludes that stable behaviors of the system change constantly with the increase of @xmath25 and we obtain a general criterion for the macroscopic quantum self - trapping trajectories , namely , @xmath128 .",
    "it plays a critical role to find the transition parameters of macroscopic quantum self - tapping .",
    "now , we focus on the dynamic behavior which dominated by eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) without the time - dependent system parameters .",
    "we study the effect parameters of the system on the mqst with numerical method starting form eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) .    choosing initial condition @xmath129 , @xmath130 , the time evolutions of the relative population fig .",
    "( 3a)-(3d ) show some very absorbing features . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the oscillations are regular and the average the relative population @xmath131 is zero for symmetric well case ( @xmath37 ) with a special parameter , but the corresponding mqst does not appear . if we increase @xmath25 from 0.45 to 0.95 in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the mqst does not still appear , but the oscillating period becomes short .",
    "similarly , rising @xmath26 , we obtain the same result as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) .    here",
    ", we study impacting asymmetric well case ( @xmath132 ) on the mqst .",
    "when we enhance the level bias to @xmath133 the average the relative population is changed to @xmath134 in fig.3(d ) .",
    "correspondingly , the oscillating period of @xmath34 is longer and the mqst emerges .",
    "note that parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 impact greatly on the mqst which are plotted in fig .",
    "3(e ) and ( f ) . in fig .",
    "3(e ) , when @xmath25 is from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , the mqst is suppressed with shorter oscillating period .",
    "similarly , with increasing @xmath26 , the average relative population are changed to @xmath137 and the oscillating period becomes shorter again , as seen in fig .",
    "thus , the influence of parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath138 on the mqst of the system is very dramatic . in the case of @xmath39 , fixing the other parameters and changing the initial condition from @xmath139 of fig.3 to @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we observe that the mqst always emerges with varying @xmath142 . the oscillating period is decreased comparing to fig.3(a)and fig .",
    "3(d ) , but the @xmath131 is increased to @xmath143 as shown in fig .",
    "according to the above analysis , we can draw conclusion that when the initial conditions @xmath129 , @xmath130 are read , the parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 can impact on the mqst for asymmetric well case(@xmath132 ) .",
    "in addition , in the symmetric case , the mqst does not appear and those parameters only affect the oscillating period of the system . besides , the initial conditions can impact the mqst for anyone parameter set .",
    "as a whole , the elementary features of chaos is that the dynamic behaviors are unpredictable for a deterministic system .",
    "it is very sensitive for the initial conditions and parameters of the system .",
    "so , according to these characteristics , we can adjust the parameters to make the system get into or get out of the chaos , in other words , we can control the regime appearing chaos . in this section",
    "we discuss the chaotic behaviors of the system by numerical method .",
    "if we apply periodic modulation on the lever bias @xmath144 , the chaos will appear in a special region , where @xmath145 stand for initial phase and amplitude respectively . inserting this into eqs .",
    "( 8)and ( 9 ) , one derives the below dynamic equation . @xmath146    starting from eqs .",
    "( 32 ) , it is found that the dynamics behavior of the system is periodic in some special parameters region and it will vary from order to chaos with the increase of @xmath147 , as shown in fig.5 . with initial conditions",
    "@xmath148 , the phase orbit is a period - one cycle and the corresponding oscillation is a rabi oscillation for the set of parameters with amplitude @xmath149 , as in fig .",
    "in this case , we set the oscillating period of the relative population @xmath150 .",
    "when @xmath151 , the phase orbit becomes period - two in fig .",
    "it means the oscillating period of @xmath34 arriving at @xmath152 .",
    "then the phase orbit increases from that of period - four to period - eight with increasing @xmath147 as shown in fig .",
    "5(c)and ( d ) .",
    "5(e ) and 5(f ) are plotted for @xmath153 and @xmath154 , where the phase orbit does not show a clear periodicity which signifies the emergence of chaos .    from the above analysis , we find that the oscillating period of the relative population varies from a period - one limit - cycle to period - two to period - four and then to period - eight and finally all limit - cycles tend to infinity with @xmath138 increasing .",
    "it exhibits a process from order to chaos , through the period - doubling bifurcations  @xcite . that is to say , for a set of fixed parameter @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath155 , @xmath147 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , the first - order derivative of relative population transform from the single period to multiple period and get into chaos at last with the increase of vibration amplitude @xmath147 .    for the aim of showing the chaotic mqst",
    ", we present the plots of the time evolution of the relative population and corresponding plots of power spectra from eqs .  ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) in fig .",
    "and the parameter of fig.5(a ) is accord with fig .",
    "6(a ) and 6(c ) where the system oscillates periodically .",
    "making use of those parameters of fig .",
    "5(e ) , we plot fig .",
    "6(b)and 6(d ) .",
    "it shows that the power spectrum appears confusion and the average value of the relative population is less than zero , which implies the existence of the chaotic behaviors .",
    "in this paper , we study the stability and chaos of bec with repulsive two- and three - body interactions immersed in a one - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the stability of the steady - state solution are analyzed with the linear stability theorem .",
    "the analytical results show : ( 1 ) for @xmath159 and @xmath160 or @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the stability of the steady - state solution(@xmath163 ) is in the critical case .",
