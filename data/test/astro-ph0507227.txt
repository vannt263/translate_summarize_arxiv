    "a puzzling question in modern cosmology has been the nature and origin of the dark energy responsible for the apparent acceleration @xcite of the universe in the present epoch .",
    "the simplest explanation is , perhaps , that of a cosmological constant , or a vacuum energy in the form of a `` quintessence '' scalar field slowly evolving along an effective potential .",
    "the existence of a cosmological constant or quintessence , however , leads inevitably to the well known fine tuning problem as to why the present dark energy is so small compared to the natural scales of high - energy physics .",
    "there is also a cosmic coincidence problem as to why the universe has conspired to produce nearly equivalent energy contents in matter and dark energy at the present time .",
    "moreover , most quintessence models are now ruled out @xcite by the fact that the equation of state parameter , @xmath2 is so close to -1 .",
    "this implies that there is little evidence for evolution in a quintessence field so that a cosmological constant remains the most likely interpretation .",
    "accounting for such dark energy , however , poses an unsolved theoretical challenge .",
    "ultimately , one would hope that the existence of this dark energy could be accounted for in the context of string theory or some other unified theory .",
    "this problem is exacerbated , however , by the fact that it appears difficult to accommodate a cosmological constant in string theory @xcite , although some progress has been made @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed @xcite that the observed cosmic acceleration may be an artifact of inhomogeneities in the distribution of mass - energy .",
    "that possibility , though compelling for its simplicity , has not yet been established @xcite .    hence ,",
    "in this paper , we consider it worthwhile to analyze an alternative mechanism by which the observed cosmic acceleration could be produced even without the need to invoke dark energy and its associated complexities .",
    "specifically , we explore models in which the cosmic acceleration is driven @xcite by the flow of dark matter from a higher dimension ( the bulk ) into our three - space ( the brane ) .",
    "this study is also in part motivated by the currently popular view that our universe could be a sub - manifold embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "this paradigm derives from the low - energy limit of the heterotic m - theory @xcite which becomes an 11-dimensional supergravity compactified on a line segment to two 10-dimensional @xmath3 gauge theories .",
    "hence , the universe can be envisioned as two smooth 10-dimensional manifolds ( 9-branes ) embedded in a bulk dimension .",
    "a thin three - brane ( randall - sundrum brane ) embedded in a five - dimensional anti - de sitter space @xmath4 has been proposed as a practical phenomenological model @xcite in which to explore such higher dimensional physics .",
    "this approach poses an alternative to the standard kaluza - klein ( kk ) compactification of extra dimensions , through the localization of the graviton zero mode on the brane .",
    "this brane approach also provides a new way of understanding the hierarchy between the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath5 and the electro - weak scale @xcite .    of relevance to the present study",
    "is that in this phenomenological approach , one can relax the requirement that the gauge groups be rigorously confined to the brane .",
    "for example , particles might be localized on a defect in the higher dimensional space @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of this would be a domain wall ( brane ) in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "in such a picture , the extra ( bulk ) dimension can be infinite and the observed 3-dimensional fields are represented by zero modes of bulk fields in the domain - wall background .",
    "these modes are localized and thus behave like 3-dimensional mass - less fields . in this domain - wall scenario ,",
    "physical matter fields are dynamically confined to this sub - manifold , while gravity can reside in the extra bulk dimension .",
    "the stability of massive matter fields has been analyzed @xcite in this scenario where it was shown that such massive particles are metastable on the brane .",
    "that is , for both scalar and fermion fields , the quasi - normal modes are metastable states that decay into continuum states . from the viewpoint of an observer in the 4-dimensional space time ,",
    "these massive particles appear to propagate for some time in three spatial dimensions and then disappear into the fifth dimension .",
    "this disappearance of massive particles from the 3-brane constitutes an energy flow from the brane to the bulk .",
    "the cosmological constraints on such disappearing matter have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover , if the massive particles can also exist in the bulk , it becomes possible to consider the inverse flow from the bulk into our three - brane . in this paper , we build a model with such mass - energy exchange , in which the flow from the bulk to the brane provides the present observed acceleration @xcite of the universe . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite a heavy ( @xmath6tev ) dark - matter candidate such as the lightest supersymmetric partner is likely to have the largest tunneling rate between the brane and bulk .",
    "moreover , a recent study @xcite of energy transfer from the bulk through parametric resonance indicates that massive particles are most efficient for depositing energy on the brane .",
    "hence , in the present work we mainly consider the exchange between the bulk and brane involving a growth of the cold dark - matter component on the brane .",
    "this model [ which we refer to as growing cold dark matter ( gcdm ) ] is , thus , an alternative to the standard @xmath1 plus cold dark matter ( s@xmath1cdm ) cosmology to an observer on the 3-brane .",
    "we test this model by analyzing the observations of type ia supernovae at high redshift , the temperature fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and the matter power spectrum .",
    "surprisingly , all of these constraints can be satisfied in this model even without introducing a cosmological constant on the brane .",
    "a shocking feature of the best fit model , however , is that the present dark - matter content becomes as much as an order of magnitude larger than that of a @xmath7cdm cosmology .",
    "the influence of this excess dark matter , however , is suppressed by the large dark - radiation component associated with the flow of matter from the bulk dimension .",
    "in fact , this model provides a natural explanation for the observed suppression of the cmb power spectrum for the lowest multipoles due to the effect of the late arriving dark matter on the integrated sachs - wolf effect .",
    "we show here that the matter power spectrum exhibits the correct power on large and small scales , however , a somewhat large bias factor is required .",
    "we begin with the five - dimensional einstein equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 5-dimensional gravitation constant with @xmath10 the 5-dimensional planck mass .",
    "@xmath11 is the five - dimensional total energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we use the index notation @xmath12 to clearly distinguish the bulk fifth dimension .",
    "the metric is assumed to be of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) @xcite form .",
    "for simplicity , however , we consider a coordinate system with a static bulk dimension and an expanding brane or moving @xcite brane .",
    "hence , we choose a metric in gauss - normal coordinates @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a maximally symmetric 3-metric . as an illustrative model , we allow the hubble expansion of the brane relative to a static bulk to produce a nonzero 5-component of the bulk fluid velocity as discussed below .      when matter is present in the bulk , the evolution of the brane is not autonomous .",
    "it becomes necessary to explicitly define the bulk energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the general bulk energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid in this 5-dimensional space - time is , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote density and pressure in 4-dimensional space . in gaussian - normal",
    "coordinates , however , the bulk 5th dimension is fixed so that the four density and pressure are proportional to the three - volume like ordinary three - space quantities . for normal matter on the brane",
    "we denote the density and pressure as @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in our model",
    "in which dark matter can exist both on the brane and in the bulk we denote the dark - matter three density and pressure on the brane as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "since the density , pressure and equation of state can be different in the bulk we denote the four density of dark matter in the bulk as @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in a frame",
    "for which the three - brane is at rest we can decompose the energy - momentum tensor into three parts . @xmath24 where the @xmath25-function identifies the location of the brane at @xmath26 to which the standard - model particles are assumed to be confined .",
    "@xmath27 , corresponds to the usual three - density and pressure , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , of ordinary relativistic and non - relativistic particles plus the tension @xmath28 on the brane . @xmath29",
    "the bulk is taken to be @xmath4 , so that the five - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath30 is negative in the bulk .",
    "hence , we write the vacuum energy - momentum for the bulk , @xmath31 , as @xmath32 in our model dark matter is allowed to exist both on the brane and in the bulk .",
    "hence , we decompose the dark - matter energy - momentum tensor , @xmath33 , into the usual three - density @xmath34 and pressure @xmath35 of dark matter on the brane , plus the bulk components @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 where , @xmath38 represents the matter - energy flow from the bulk to the brane , while @xmath39 represents a bulk pressure in the limit of vanishing @xmath40 .    as we shall see , the cosmology for an observer living on the three - brane will depend upon the equation of state ( eos ) properties for matter in the bulk dimension .",
    "it is not guaranteed , however , that matter will have the same eos properties in the bulk as on the brane .",
    "inevitably , assumptions must be made @xcite about the form of the energy - momentum tensor for matter in the bulk .",
    "for example , a bulk field @xcite , or radiation emitted from the brane to the bulk @xcite have been considered along with possible thermal effects @xcite . in a string theory sense",
    ", particles in the bulk may appear as a topological defect between two branes .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we adopt @xcite the usual parametrization of the eos for matter in the bulk . scaling the bulk dark - matter density to the present critical density @xmath41 on the brane ,",
    "we write : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the scale factor on the brane , defined as @xmath44 , and for a fixed bulk dimension the scaling parameter @xmath45 can be written @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the usual equation of state parameter with , @xmath48 for normal cold dark matter , while @xmath49 for relativistic matter . a value of @xmath50 corresponds to a vacuum energy , while @xmath51 for a string - like topological defect .    to illustrate this cosmology we consider two models for the motion of matter in the bulk relative to the brane . in the gaussian - normal coordinates ,",
    "the five velocity of matter in the static bulk with respect to the expanding 3-brane is just @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53^{1/2}~~,\\ ] ] is the bulk curvature radius @xcite .    as a second illustration",
    "we also consider the case of a constant @xmath40 component .",
    "such a model might correspond , for example , to gravitational accretion of matter from the bulk toward the brane at a constant rate .",
    "for the purposes of scaling , we parameterize the 0 - 5 component of the bulk dark - matter energy - momentum tensor as @xmath54 where we have assumed a constant transition rate of matter between the bulk and the brane absorbed into the dimensionless parameter @xmath55 which can be either positive or negative . for the case of constant @xmath40",
    "we replace @xmath56 in the above scaling , where @xmath57 is the present hubble parameter .",
    "the cosmological equations of motion with brane - bulk energy exchange have previously been formulated in refs .",
    "the covariant derivative of the energy - momentum tensor leads to the usual energy conservation condition for various components @xmath58 of normal matter on the brane ; @xmath59 plus a new condition for the dark matter which takes into account the flow of matter from the brane world , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the discontinuity of the ( 0,5 ) component of @xmath36 at @xmath26 .",
    "the ( 0,0 ) component of the einstein equation produces a modified friedmann cosmology to an observer on the brane : + @xmath62 while the ( 5,5 ) component leads to an equation for the dark radiation term @xmath63 , @xmath64 in eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) the usual change variables has been introduced : @xmath65 @xmath66~~,\\ ] ] and @xmath67 introducing these identities into eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) leads to the usual friedmann equation plus extra terms with @xmath63 and @xmath68 .",
    "this modified friedmann equation can be normalized in the usual way so that the spatial curvature takes on values @xmath69 . in the limit of an empty bulk and no exchange between the bulk and the brane , @xmath70 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath63 varies with scale factor on the brane as @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath63 reduces to the standard dark - radiation term when all matter fields are confined to the brane .",
    "now we assume that the dark matter is cold on the brane : @xmath72 .",
    "first , we consider the special case @xmath73",
    ". a solution of eq .",
    "( [ rho - dm ] ) is @xmath74 .",
    "this is precisely the disappearing dark matter cosmology introduced in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath73 describes matter - energy flow from the brane into the bulk . in this cosmology",
    "dark - matter particles can exist in both the brane and the bulk .",
    "hence , negative @xmath75 describes a reverse flow from the bulk to the brane .",
    "however , in the present paper , we only consider the inflow from the bulk into the brane .      to see how an accelerating cosmology arises , consider the simple example of a constant flow rate from the bulk into the brane , i.e. @xmath76 for a positive constant @xmath77 .",
    "in the case of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , ( nearly realized in the present universe ) equations ( [ rho - dm])-([chi ] ) have a fixed point @xmath80 governed by , @xmath81 the constant r.h.s .  of equation ( [ h * ] )",
    "then is manifestly equivalent to a cosmological - constant dominated universe .",
    "in general , the fixed point remains even in the case of @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the present accelerating universe need not be attributed to @xmath83 at all , but could also arise from constant bulk components of the five dimensional stress - energy tensor , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "when a fluid is static , @xmath85 represents a pressure , it is then natural to set the pressure to be zero . but @xmath85 is in general non - vanishing for a moving flow . another possibility for non - vanishing @xmath85 is that the dark matter in the bulk is in a vacuum state . in this case , @xmath85 is a vacuum pressure , and it is likely that @xmath86 .",
    "we consider two growing dark matter models of interest to the present work .",
    "for the case of vanishing @xmath88 and constant @xmath40 , the evolution equations of energy densities are rewritten as , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the dark - radiation term which plays the role of dark energy . for the case of @xmath91 ,",

    "note , that in this latter case , the fact that @xmath93 means that eq .",
    "( [ rhochidot ] ) quickly evolves to @xmath94 for the case when @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , as long as @xmath96 an accelerating cosmology eventually emerges @xcite .",
    "hence , the dark radiation contribution becomes constant and indistinguishable from a cosmological constant .    for the @xmath97 accelerating cosmology of interest here , the modified friedmann equation for cosmic expansion can be written @xmath98 here we have neglected the @xmath99 term .",
    "this term decays rapidly as @xmath100 in the early radiation dominated epoch and hence is insignificant for the present studies .",

    "figure [ fig : energy ] illustrates the evolution of various components on the brane in a simple @xmath103 cosmology .",
    "this cosmology separates into three characteristic epochs on this figure .",
    "first , the usual early radiation dominated epoch ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "second , a dark - matter dominated epoch ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "third , the dark matter and dark radiation dominated accelerating epoch ( @xmath106 ) .",

    ", the dark radiation term is initially much larger than for the case of constant @xmath40 and it remains at a nearly constant value .",
    "nevertheless , during the radiation- and matter - dominated epochs , the dark radiation term for both models is insignificant until recent history near @xmath112 .",
    "hence , this cosmology is not constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xcite    this model thus explains the smallness problem of the apparent cosmological constant as simply due to the slow tunneling of matter from the bulk onto the brane .",
    "the cosmic acceleration only occurs now , because this is the epoch for which the fixed - point solution could be obtained .",
    "moreover , in what follows we show that the fits to observations based upon these two models are indistinguishable from each other and from the best standard @xmath7cdm model .",
    "eventually , in the third region the cosmology of interest to this paper emerges .",
    "the dark radiation component dominates . in the case of @xmath113",
    "it becomes a constant dark - energy density .",
    "hence , the dark radiation associated with in - flowing cold dark matter leads the cosmic acceleration without the need for a cosmological constant on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) as long as matter in the bulk has the right equation of state .",
    "having defined the cosmology of interest we now analyze the various cosmological constraints as a test of this hypothesis by solving equations ( 24)-(30 ) numerically . in particular , we examine the magnitude - redshift relation for type ia supernovae ( snia ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the matter power spectrum @xmath114 .",

    "thus , our model realizes the present cosmic acceleration without a cosmological constant .",
    "this figure also illustrates an important point regarding the eos parameter for matter in the bulk dimension .",
    "an accelerating cosmology requires that @xmath138 be nearly constant .",

    "figure [ fig : cls ] shows best - fit theoretical cmb power spectra along with the combined data set used to constrain our models .",
    "this figure illustrates how the flow of mass - energy exchange can modify the spectrum .",
    "there are essentially two ways in which growing cold dark matter models alter the cmb power spectrum .",
    "first , gcdm means that there is less dark matter at earlier times .",
    "this leads to a smaller amplitude of the third acoustic peak @xcite .",
    "second , the decay of the gravitational potential at late times is diminished due to the inflow of dark matter .",
    "this leads to a smaller late integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( lisw ) and correspondingly less power for the smallest multipoles .",

    "figure [ swolf ] illustrates the evolution of the @xmath154 and @xmath155 potential derivatives with scale factor . in the @xmath7cdm model",
    "the gravitational potentials are rapidly decaying at late times which causes enhanced power on the largest scales ( smallest multipoles ) . in the gcdm model , however , the potentials on the largest scale are changing less .",
    "this accounts for the relative suppression of cmb power for the lowest multipoles .    for the combined snia and cmb data we again used the mcmc approach in a seven dimensional parameter space ( @xmath142 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath55 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "it should be noted that in the gcdm cosmology of interest here we must treat @xmath158 and @xmath117 as independent parameters in the snia analysis contrary to the usual cosmologies .",
    "this is because the evolution of the energy densities @xmath159 and @xmath160 obey different functions of the cosmic scale factor @xmath161 in the gcdm cosmology .",
    "these data imply a minimum in @xmath131 of 1659.8 for the gcdm model without a cosmological constant , compared to a value of 1661.7 obtained in the s@xmath1cdm model .",
    "note , however , that in our model there are seven parameters ( @xmath142 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath55 , @xmath45 ) , while in the s@xmath1cdm model there are only six ( @xmath142 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath162 ) .",
    "hence , there is no significant improvement in the reduced @xmath131 per degree of freedom as evidenced in table 1 .    although the gcdm model explains the apparent suppression of the cmb at low multipoles , the optical depth is rather large for the optimum fit to the cmb alone ( @xmath163 ) .",

    "@xmath144 is better constrained so that a smaller value of @xmath164 results .",
    "note also , that in all of these fits a large value of @xmath165 is obtained .",
    "this value is offset , however , by the negative dark radiation component as discussed below .",
    "the key constraint is that @xmath166 as evidenced in the fifth column of table 1 .",
    ".2 in      it is straight forward to determine the galactic matter power spectrum @xmath114 to compare with that deduced from large - scale structure surveys @xcite . for the usual power - law spectrum of primordial fluctuations @xmath167 a transfer function , @xmath168 @xcite",

    "however , we also correct for the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum @xcite .    here",
    "it is worth noting the way in which the power spectrum is computed in our gcdm model .",
    "it is necessary to specify the distribution of the dark matter as it enters from the bulk dimension",
    ". it would be most general to suppose that there are fluctuations in the bulk mass - energy distribution just as there are in the brane .",
    "material entering from the bulk would then appear with such fluctuations .",
    "however , we make the simplifying assumption that the dark matter and dark radiation enter with uniform distributions . after that , they are allowed to evolve as non - relativistic and relativistic particles , respectively , along with the already evolved structures on the brane .",
    "hence , we define the matter over density as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the effective dark matter density as would be deduced , for example , by the gravitational potential of a galaxy cluster . for the gcdm model",
    "the effective over density is @xmath175 and the effective gravitation mass energy density is @xmath176 as usual , a bias parameter is introduced to account for the difference between the galaxy and matter power spectrum , @xmath177    we have made a mcmc simultaneous fit to the cmb+snia+@xmath114 data . we get the best fit parameters , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",

    "the parameters associated with this model are summarized in table 1 . in these",
    "fits the bias @xmath180 is a marginalized parameter .",
    "it is perhaps of note that the bias parameter deduced in this way is somewhat larger @xmath181 than that deduced in the usual s@xmath1cdm models , @xmath182 .",
    "this derives from the fact that the dark matter potentials are not as deep at early times , and hence , galaxy formation must be more efficient to produce the observed amplitude .",
    "we have considered models in which the apparent cosmological constant derives from the energy exchange of cold dark matter from the bulk dimension to the brane .",
    "the energy momentum tensor in this extra dimensional brane cosmology leads naturally to terms resembling a cosmological constant at the present time .",
    "if such energy exchange occurs our universe accelerates without the need to invoke a cosmological constant on the 3-brane .",
    "we find that such gcdm exchanges are consistent with observations including the supernova magnitude - redshift relation , temperature fluctuations in the cmb , and the matter power - spectrum data .",
    "this cosmology is even slightly preferred as it fits better the suppression of the cmb power spectrum at low multipoles .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that this cosmology represents an alternative model to the s@xmath1cdm cosmology for an observer on the 3-brane .",
    "a consistent fit to the observational constraints , however , requires that the eos parameter for matter in the bulk be small @xmath183 .",
    "this eos is consistent with a need for an ads@xmath184 geometry in the bulk .",
    "a peculiar feature of the present best fit models , is the fact that the true value of @xmath117 is much larger than in the standard cosmology , though its gravitational effect is canceled by the dark - radiation contribution .",
    "indeed , the key constraint is that @xmath166 as evidenced in the fifth column of table 1 .",
    "one consequence of such a large and growing dark - matter contribution is the need for a somewhat large bias parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "such a large dark matter content suggests new observational tests of this cosmology .",
    "for example , if the dark - matter content at the present time is much larger than in a s@xmath1cdm model , then direct terrestrial measurements of the total density of cold dark - matter particles could indicate a much higher density than expected based upon their mass and gravitation effect .",
    "another test of this cosmology is that there should be a suppression of the matter power spectrum on the scale of the horizon compared to a s@xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "other tests of this paradigm are that a suppression of the third acoustic peak in the cmb power spectrum occurs so that better data near @xmath185 could help distinguish this cosmology .",
    "we also note that this cosmology produces large oscillations in the cmb polarization power spectrum so that when better polarization data are available it should help to eliminate of confirm this cosmology .",
    "an amusing feature of this model stems from the requirement that the present dark radiation from in - flowing matter must cancel the effects of excess existing dark matter .",
    "hence , if the flow were to cease , the universe would change to a matter - dominated @xmath186 cosmology which would begin to collapse in about a hubble time . in that sense , this is a new kind of doomsday cosmology @xcite .",
