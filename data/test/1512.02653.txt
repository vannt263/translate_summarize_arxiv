    "the quadratic scalar @xmath92 , and other curvature invariants are also finite in the center for @xmath70 as we are considering .",

    "the position of this maximum , which gives the width of the small cavity from @xmath86 up to this maximum , with the corresponding value for @xmath42 , is predetermined by the values of all four parameters .",

    "greater than this first maximum , there exist a zone in which the first derivative @xmath93 is negative .",
    "thus , we deal with a repulsion zone here . the size of the repulsion zone is set by the parameter @xmath78 , roughly of the order of @xmath78 .",
    "in addition when the mass @xmath79 is small enough and the cosmological constant is negative , @xmath94 , the maximum can be converted into an inflection point and the repulsion barrier vanishes . for a wide range of values of the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath2 there exists a newtonian - type attraction zone of the metric function @xmath88 , where it behaves as @xmath97 .",
    "when @xmath98 , this zone starts at infinity and finishes at some point .",
    "when @xmath99 , this newtonian attraction zone appears only if the mass of the object exceeds some critical value .",
    "finally , depending on the sign and value of the cosmological constant the solutions are asymptotically ds , asymptotically flat , or asymptotically ads .",
    "the most important feature of our investigation is the analysis of the horizons as functions of the parameters .",
    "cauchy , event , and cosmological horizons can appear , and in some instances they can coincide one with another or the three altogether .",
    "the details are given below .",
    "when @xmath100 , and the roots @xmath101 are real and positive , we deal with horizons at these radii .",
    "since the equation @xmath100 can be reduced to an algebraic equation of order six , see eq .",
    "( [ n00 ] ) , @xmath102 , one can be sure that the number of horizons is not more than six .",
    "we intend to show that in the model under consideration the number of horizons can not be more than three .",
    "moreover , all the existing solutions for the horizons @xmath101 , namely , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , depend on sign and value of @xmath2 , i.e. , the cosmological constant participates in the formation of the causal structure of the spacetime .",
    "generically the three horizons that appear are the cauchy horizon , the event horizon , and the cosmological horizon . to study the causal structure of the corresponding spacetimes we have , first , to count the horizon number , second , to classify the horizons , and third , to visualize them in figures .",
    "thus in order to find the location of the horizons , i.e. , to find @xmath101 explicitly one should solve @xmath106 i.e. , the sixth - order equation @xmath107      another important property is the number of the horizons . instead of using eqs .",
