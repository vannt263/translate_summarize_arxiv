    "this paper is a continuation in a series of papers ( papers i  vi and viii ",
    "ix ) of radial - velocity studies of close binary stars @xcite and presents data for the ninth group of ten close binary stars observed at the david dunlap observatory . for technical details and conventions , and for preliminary estimates of uncertainties , see the interim summary paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper vii ) .",
    "selection of the targets is quasi - random : at a given time , we observe a few dozen close binary systems with periods shorter than one day , brighter than 10  11 magnitude and with declinations @xmath2 ; we publish the results in groups of ten systems as soon as reasonable orbital elements are obtained from measurements evenly distributed in orbital phases .",
    "whenever possible , we estimate spectral types of the program stars using our classification spectra .",
    "these are compared with the mean @xmath3 color indexes taken from the _",
    "tycho-2 _ catalog @xcite and the photometric estimates of the spectral types using the relations published by @xcite .",
    "the observations reported in this paper have been collected between june 1997 and november 2004 .",
    "the ranges of dates for individual systems can be found in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "all systems discussed in this paper , except three : hs  aqr , sw  lac , and ks  peg , have been observed by us for radial - velocity variations for the first time .",
    "we have derived the radial velocities in the same way as described in previous papers .",
    "see paper  vii for a discussion of the broadening - function approach used in the derivation of the radial - velocity orbit parameters : the amplitudes , @xmath4 , the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath5 , and the time - of - primary - eclipse epoch , @xmath6 .",
    "the novelty of this paper is the treatment of binaries with very weak signatures of binarity in their broadening functions , resulting either from exceptionally weak mg  i @xmath7 triplet lines ( v395  and , section  [ v395and ] ) or from the presence of a bright third star in the system ( tu  umi , section  [ tuumi ] ) which limits the dynamic range in the broadening function . we utilize here an approach borrowed from image processing techniques in that we represent the broadening function information in the phase domain as a two - dimensional image where smoothing in the phase coordinate restores the temporal correlation between successive broadening functions .",
    "this paper is structured in a way similar to that of previous papers , in that most of the data for the observed binaries are in two tables consisting of the radial - velocity measurements in table  [ tab1 ] and their preliminary sine - curve solutions in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] contains data for nine stars as we have not been able to derive individual radial velocities for the difficult case of tu  umi .",
    "the data in table  [ tab2 ] are organized in the same manner as in previous papers .",
    "in addition to the parameters of spectroscopic orbits , the table provides information about the relation between the spectroscopically observed epoch of the primary - eclipse t@xmath8 and the recent photometric determinations in the form of the @xmath9 deviations for the number of elapsed periods @xmath10 .",
    "it also contains our new spectral classifications of the program objects .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] of the paper contains brief summaries of previous studies for individual systems and comments on the new data .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] and figure  [ fig4 ] show the 2-d broadening function images for v395  and and tu  umi while figure  [ fig2 ] and figure  [ fig3 ] show the radial velocity data and solutions .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the bf s for all systems ; the functions have been selected from among the best defined ones , usually around the orbital phase of 0.25 using the photometric system of phases counted from the deeper eclipse .",
    "photometric variability of the star was discovered by the hipparcos satellite @xcite ; the star was assigned rrc type in the 74th special name - list of variable stars @xcite on the basis of the hipparcos data .",
    "@xcite suggested that v395  and is a contact eclipsing system on the basis of the period - color relation .",
    "light elements were calculated by @xcite , hjd=2448500.4372 + e 0.684656 using the hipparcos photometric data and the doubled value of the original period .",
    "v395 and was listed in the @xcite with the spectral type of this object estimated as b8 ( this type is also quoted in the washington double star catalog , from now on called wds ) . and radial velocity of @xmath11 km  s@xmath12 ; in the hd catalog the spectral type is a0 .",
    "our spectra of the magnesium triplet in v395  and showed an exceptionally weak , poorly defined , strongly broadened feature with depth of only 2 percent of continuum with no discernible doubling . while we expected that the feature will be weak in a nominally a0 type star ( simbad ) ,",
    "the particular weakness of the line was surprising .",
    "the star is relatively bright , @xmath13 .",
    "it is a member of a visual binary ( wds  23445 + 4623 ) .",
    "the companion at a separation of 5.7 arcsec is 2.2 mag fainter than v395  and .",
    "it is visible at the position angle @xmath14 and thus is projected into our east  west spectrograph slit .",
    "its presence may have produced weakening of the spectral lines by probably less than 15% .",
    "original estimates based on the very shallow and poorly defined broadening functions ( bf s ) suggested that the star will be entirely intractable and may have to be abandoned .",
    "our standard technique of measuring radial velocities requires that each bf , for each spectrum , gives a peak or a pair of peaks for radial velocity centroid determination ; such well defined peaks simply did not exist for v395  and .",
    "however , a new approach , partly based on ideas used in image processing worked relatively well : the bf s were ordered in as columns in a two - dimensional image , with y - coordinate being the heliocentric radial velocity .",
    "the x - coordinate , the phase , is obviously unevenly filled and the data can be interpolated into a regular grid of phases . at this point , we utilize the fact that the bf s are correlated in the temporal ( phase ) domain so we can use smoothing .",
    "thus , horizontal cuts through the bf - image were convolved with a gaussian kernel with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.025 in phase , and then re - binned into a new uniform phase system with 40 phase points .",
    "the `` broadening function image '' is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] while a section at phase 0.75 is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , among the broadening functions for other stars of this group .",
    "even after processing of all available 103 spectra of v395  and , as described above , only some of the smoothed bf s were measurable for individual radial velocities .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tab1 ] as for other stars , but they should be used with considerable caution .",
    "the smoothed broadening functions were originally found at 0.025 intervals in phase and heliocentric times were calculated for them using the @xmath6 prediction given above . some of the smoothed bf s were still too poor and",
    "have been eliminated from the listing .",
    "the final solution is based on the data as listed in table  [ tab1 ] and required a new value of the initial epoch @xmath6 , as given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the star appears to be a very close pair with almost identical components , @xmath15 .",
    "the component potentially eclipsed at the primary minimum ( corresponding to @xmath6 ) is less massive ; its peak in the broadening function is slightly sharper and taller indicating higher surface temperature and lower rotation rate .",
    "the very small amplitude of light variations , @xmath16 , suggests that the eclipses will not be actually observed and that the binary is an `` ellipsoidal variable '' showing only proximity effects .",
    "our classification spectra clearly indicated a spectral type as early as b7 which is difficult to reconcile with the close orbit with the period of 0.685 days .",
    "the two spectra that we obtained were not identical and showed some peculiar variability and emission at he  i @xmath17 .",
    "no spectral estimate of @xmath18 was possible due to peculiarity of the spectra .",
    "stars of the spectral type of b7 or b8 have masses around 2.8 to 3.0 @xmath19 and radii around 2.2 to 2.4 @xmath20 .",
    "if the orbit has @xmath21 then the current data would imply @xmath22 which is just about possible for a contact system .",
    "hs  aqr is a detached or semi - detached binary .",
    "spectroscopic studies based on the high quality echelle spectra were presented by @xcite .",
    "this was followed by an extensive discussion of the photometric and spectroscopic data by @xcite .",
    "the above sources provide the most extensive references to properties of the system .",
    "the value of @xmath6 was taken from @xcite : @xmath23 .",
    "our observations of hs  aqr give a good solution of the radial velocity orbit ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , but perhaps not of such a high quality as that of popper which was based on the echelle spectrograph spectra .",
    "however , since the main uncertainties in this field are not in random errors , but in systematic differences in measuring techniques , we give our solution here for future reference .",
    "the broadening function at phase close to 0.25 ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) shows two well defined peaks for detached components , with that for the secondary components a bit broader indicating that this component is larger , if this star is in rotation - revolution synchronism .",
    "this agrees with the supposition @xcite that the secondary component is close to or fills its roche lobe .",
    "our new spectral type estimate of f6v is slightly earlier than previously discussed ( f8v and g8 - 9 ) , in a better agreement with the tycho-2 @xcite color index @xmath24 .",
    "the binary is in a visual system ( ccdm j20409 - 0036ab , ads  14147ab ) , but the companion at 1.6 arcsec separation is some 4 magnitudes fainter than hs  aqr thus of no consequence for the radial velocity orbit .",
    "the recent minimum prediction by @xcite perfectly agrees with our determination of the initial epoch @xmath6 .",
    "the star is bright , @xmath25 , but was not included in the hipparcos database , so its parallax is currently unknown .",
    "v449  aur was discovered photometrically by the hipparcos mission .",
    "the primary eclipse prediction was the hip one : @xmath26 .",
    "the mean @xmath27 data of @xcite , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , suggest an early - type no later than a5/6v , while our spectral classification is a2iv and , through a comparison with the color index , implies some reddening .",
    "the binary type of the system is not clear at this moment : the broadening functions are partially blended , as in a contact binary , and somewhat difficult to measure for centroid determinations ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) . on the basis of its very shallow hipparcos light curve , but with rather well - defined eclipses , the binary was considered by @xcite to be a detached one ( ea ) ; the broadening functions would rather suggest a contact binary .",
    "however , the large widths of the peaks in the broadening functions and the resulting blending may result from rotational velocities higher than the synchronous ones .",
    "the mass ratio is not far from unity , @xmath30 , which is frequently encountered among early - type very close binaries .",
    "the scatter of the radial velocity observations of the slightly more massive component , which is eclipsed in the primary minimum , appears to be genuinely larger at phases around 0.2  0.4 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) ; we have no explanation for it .",
    "fp boo is another case of the hipparcos photometric discovery .",
    "the hipparcos period and @xmath6 serve the current observations relatively well : @xmath31 .",
    "the previous spectral type given by simbad and in the hipparcos database , a5 , does not agree with our estimate of f0v ; the latter would imply @xmath32 whereas the tycho-2 mean color index is even redder , @xmath33 , corresponding to f2v .",
    "the hipparcos photometry was analyzed by @xcite using a simplified approach .",
    "the mass ratio was estimated at @xmath34 , which is in a surprisingly good agreement with the spectroscopic result , @xmath35 , taking into account that the light curve is shallow and does not show any obvious total eclipses .",
    "( this case is  in our view ",
    "an exception , a fortuitous coincidence . normally , we do not trust the so - called photometric mass ratios because so many stars in our rv program show @xmath36 ) .",
    "fp  boo was somewhat faint ( @xmath37 ) for hipparcos photometry , so the light curve could be easily improved .",
    "since the velocity amplitudes are large and thus imply the orbital inclination close to 90 degrees , it is likely that more precise photometry will show total eclipses . in its small mass ratio and the spectral type of f0/2v ,",
    "the system is somewhat similar to the well - known contact binary aw  uma .",
    "the radial velocity orbit is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] while a broadening function close to phase 0.25 is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "sw lac is one of the most frequently photometrically observed contact binaries .",
    "it is a bright ( @xmath38 ) binary with a large amplitude and an unstable light curve and thus an easy target for investigations utilizing small telescopes .",
    "several discussions addressed the matter of evolving surface spots , the most recent being by @xcite where references to previous work can be found .",
    "sw lac is a late type contact binary with the spectral type variously assigned as g3 , g5 and k0 .",
    "our new classification is g5v which predicts a color index a bit less red than the observed @xmath39 ; possibly g8v would be a good compromise . from the moment of minima predictions as well as the direct detection of faint spectral signatures @xcite",
    ", the binary appears to have at least one  probably two  nearby , low mass companions @xcite .",
    "the system is known to change the orbital period .",
    "we used the moment of primary minimum of @xcite : @xmath40 which ideally predicts our @xmath6 .",
    "our observations form the third currently available set of radial velocity data ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) . @xcite",
    "published the first radial velocity orbit , with @xmath41 .",
    "a similar , but not identical result was obtained soon after by @xcite who published only the mass ratio , @xmath42 , without more details . in spite of the large brightness of the star and excellent definition of the individual peaks in the broadening functions , our mass ratio , @xmath43 , carries a larger error than for most of our targets , probably because of the genuine changes in the broadening functions , which are caused by elevated stellar surface activity",
    "what is important , however , that radial velocity semi - amplitudes in our orbit ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) are larger than previously observed : our total mass estimate , @xmath44 ( the primary 2.18 @xmath19 , the secondary 0.92 @xmath19 ) , is significantly larger than for the orbit of @xcite , @xmath45 .",
    "since most of systematic effects result in a reduction of the radial velocity amplitudes , our result is more trustworthy as it is based on the superior technique of the broadening functions .",
    "thus , sw  lac is a relatively massive , but surprisingly cool system , a situation which was very clearly seen before in the case of another cool contact binary ah  vir @xcite . as in the case of ah  vir ,",
    "the masses are characteristic for f - type stars while the combined luminosity is in agreement with small star sizes  implied by the roche geometry of a very short period system  and their low temperature ( g5v ) .",
    "indeed , for sw  lac , the @xmath46 calibration @xcite predicts @xmath47 as compared with the parallax - based , observed @xmath48 , so that the geometry and photometric properties are those of a late - type , compact contact system , only the masses are too large .",
    "we have not noticed in individual broadening functions any traces of the third component detected by @xcite and apparently producing part of the time - of - minima perturbations @xcite . however , the same spectra , when averaged in the heliocentric system , clearly show a late type dwarf contributing about 1  percent to the total light at our 5184    spectral window ( caroline dangelo and marten van kerkwijk , 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "the bright star ks peg ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , also called 75  peg , has been known as a radial velocity variable for a long time , since the work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite recognized the peculiar properties of this binary star , in particular the very small mass ratio of @xmath51 making the velocity amplitude of the primary component small and the secondary component invisible in their spectra .",
    "the photometric variability was observed by @xcite while a good quality light curve was provided by the hipparcos @xcite project .",
    "the light curve with amplitude of only 0.1 magnitude shows very wide minima with unusual , sharply peaked , brief light maxima .",
    "we observed ks  peg in our standard way , and  because the star is so bright  with a particular attention to detection of the secondary component . in our series of observations",
    ", we have already detected several binaries with @xmath52 , with some even below this limit , such as sx  crv at @xmath53 @xcite , so we hoped to see a signature of the secondary .",
    "the spectral type of ks  peg is a1v ; we used the star of a2v as a main template , but we also used another f8v radial velocity standard to possibly capture the signature of the secondary component of later spectral type .",
    "none of these led to detection of any traces of the secondary , even when applying the technique of the `` bf - image '' smoothing described above for v395  and ( section  [ v395and ] ) which permits detection of weak features correlating in the phase domain .",
    "since the spectra of such a bright star result in particularly good determinations of the broadening functions , the non - detection of the secondary is puzzling and indicates that the secondary may be a very low mass star or even a massive planet , just able to enforce rapid rotation on the visible component , but too faint to contribute light to the overall luminosity of the binary .",
    "one of the panels of figure  [ fig5 ] shows comparison of broadening functions at both orbital elongations ( averages of 6 bf s at each elongation ) .",
    "rapid rotation of the primary component and its ( small ) orbital displacements are very clearly visible , but there is no sign of the secondary component .",
    "note that systematic trends in the baselines are due to the rectification process with inevitably different tracing of the continuum for the program and the standard template spectra .",
    "these trends may mask a very weak secondary component .",
    "our initial reference epoch was that of the hipparcos photometry , @xmath54 , which predicts our @xmath6 very well .",
    "in fact , with the same period as in the table , even the epoch of the @xcite is well predicted more than 16 thousand epochs earlier ( the authors in fact suggested 0.5021035 , which does not tie all observations that well ) .",
    "the remarkable constancy of the orbital period may be one of useful hints in interpretation of ks  peg .",
    "ks  peg is an important object because it is a bright star and thus belongs to the complete , magnitude - limited hipparcos sample of short - period binaries brighter than 7.5 magnitude @xcite .",
    "its parallax is moderately large , @xmath55 milli - arcsec , and the star is intrinsically bright , @xmath56 .",
    "the absolute magnitude agrees very well with the expected value for a main sequence a1 star , @xmath57 .",
    "the large projected rotational velocity of the primary component , @xmath58 km  s@xmath12 , implies that the orbital inclination can not be far from @xmath59 degrees .",
    "assuming @xmath60 , @xmath61 , one can achieve a consistent picture , in terms of reproduction of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with a relatively small secondary star with @xmath64 and thus @xmath65 , in a binary with the orbital inclination @xmath66 .      iw  per is somewhat similar to ks  peg described above :",
    "it is also bright , @xmath67 , small amplitude , 0.04 mag . , photometric variable .",
    "the variability was recognized by @xcite , but most of the research concentrated on on the chemical peculiarities and am characteristics @xcite .",
    "iw  per was not a lucky star in our observations .",
    "a new ccd system which was used for it failed after some time and the data could not be related to those taken before or after as our technique requires high consistency in observations of program and template stars .",
    "later on , it was realized , that the heavy dewar of the ccd system induced flexure in the spectrograph of up to 1/2 of the pixel in the detector focal plane .",
    "we decided to analyze and publish the available data for iw  per when it was realized that it is a single - line spectroscopic binary , precluding any in - depth studies of this system . in the final radial velocity solution ,",
    "the spectra taken at large hour angles have been given half weight to account for the spectrograph flexure .",
    "the period and the initial epoch for our observations have been taken from the hipparcos database . @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast to ks  peg , iw  per is not a very low amplitude radial velocity variable : the half amplitude @xmath69 km  s@xmath12 indicates that the mass ratio is not very small , probably around @xmath70 and that the spectroscopically invisible component is a star with a mass only slightly smaller than solar .",
    "the visible component rotates with @xmath71 km  s@xmath12 which is consistent with synchronous rotation in a moderately wide binary with the orbital period of 0.917 days .",
    "iw per has the best determined parallax among stars of th current group , @xmath72 mas .",
    "the implied luminosity , @xmath73 , the spectral type a3v and @xmath74 are mutually consistent .",
    "v592 per is another photometric discovery of hipparcos .",
    "it is a relatively bright , @xmath75 , basically unstudied contact binary .",
    "the moment of primary eclipse from hipparcos , @xmath76 serves well for prediction of @xmath6 .",
    "the star has been known to possess a visual companion at a separation of only 0.16 arcsec @xcite .",
    "data for wds  04445 + 3953 indicate that the position angle changes rather rapidly so the system is definitely a physical one .",
    "we re - discovered the companion spectroscopically : in the broadening functions , its signature is strong , because of its sharpness , but the companion is fainter than the binary with @xmath77 , or @xmath78 mag ; in the wds catalog @xmath79 mag .    to determine the close binary orbit , we analyzed our observations the way as before for triple systems , by first fitting three gaussians to the whole bf , then subtracting the third star gaussian and then measuring the radial velocities of both binary components from the residual broadening functions . in spite of the presence of the visual companion , the contact binary orbit is well defined , with @xmath80",
    "the spectroscopic result is in total disagreement with the mass ratio estimated from the light curve of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "once again , we stress that  due to the very low information content of light curves  light curve solutions for partially eclipsing contact binaries have little sense and they should not be attempted without supporting spectroscopic data .",
    "our observations are spread over time in that there is a gap of two full seasons .",
    "the radial velocities of the third component were estimated from all available spectra giving the average value of @xmath82 km  s@xmath12 for the first season ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 km  s@xmath12 for the second season ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "our systematic uncertainties are at the level of @xmath86 km  s@xmath12 , while measurements in the presence of the variable binary `` background '' difficult , so we can not claim that we see seasonal variation in @xmath87 ; it is basically identical to @xmath5 of the contact binary .    in view of similar luminosities ,",
    "the spectral type f2iv estimated by @xcite most probably applies to both stars , the contact binary v592  per and the third star in the system .",
    "this spectral type does not agree with @xmath88 estimated from the tycho-2 data @xcite which suggests f5f6 .",
    "tu umi is one of the hipparcos photometric discoveries .",
    "a description of new photometric observations conducted concurrently with the spectroscopic observations was given by @xcite ; the paper contains also references to work related to identification of the variability and of the determination of the period at twice the hipparcos original period .",
    "the previous photometric paper @xcite was based on a short time interval and could not provide a new value of the period which was estimated to only 4 significant figures .",
    "however , the hipparcos period , which we use here , together with the new photometric epoch , jd(min ) = 2,452,725,6262 @xcite , counted back to the hipparcos epoch ( additionally shifted by 1/4 of the period because the star was thought to be a pulsating one so the time of its maximum light was used ) , jd(min ) = 2,448,499.9747 , indicate a good stability of the period .",
    "tu umi is a case of a contact binary with a bright close companion .",
    "we were not aware that it had been known as a visual binary wds  14557 + 7618 with separation of 0.2 arcsec ( this is well below the 1.88 m telescope resolution in our location ) when we started the observations .",
    "the spectral lines of the close binary are very broad and , in fact , entirely invisible in individual spectra , being masked by the strong sharp spectrum of the companion .    with 70 individual spectra",
    "rather evenly covering orbital phases , we attempted to analyze the data using the approach similar to that described for v395  and ( section  [ v395and ] ) by ordering in phase and smoothing the broadening functions .",
    "this case is much more difficult than that of v395  and because , even after averaging , the binary features are too weak and too poorly defined for being measured ; most of the dynamic range in the bf is `` wasted '' on the sharp peak of the tertiary component ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we attempted to remove this peak from the broadening function .",
    "first , we followed our normal routines of approximating the third star feature by a gaussian and subtracting it .",
    "this did not work as the profile is not gaussian at its base where its shape is particularly important .",
    "then we attempted to find the shape of the third - star peak by combining all broadening functions and determining their lower envelope .",
    "this still did not provide a correct shape of the tertiary peak at the base , since none of the bf s was really free of the binary signature .",
    "thus , we were unable to remove the tertiary and to determine individual radial velocities of components for tu  umi ; this star does not have any data listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "while this is disappointing , we feel that it is doubtful if this star will ever permit a detailed parameter determination .",
    "in this situation , we present only very rough estimates from what can be derived from just eyeballed fit to the broadening functions in the 2-dimensional representation ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .    in plotting the expected changes in the broadening functions as a function of phase",
    ", we assumed the initial epoch as observed simultaneously photometrically by @xcite .",
    "the star appears to be a w - type contact system with a rather large amplitude of the secondary star variation , perhaps as large as @xmath89 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "an estimate for the primary is @xmath90 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "these amplitudes are shown on the bf image in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "integrations of the wide binary feature at several phases indicate that the binary is in fact only marginally fainter than the third component , @xmath91 , but the sharpness of its peak dominates in the combined spectrum of the system . the above estimate of the relative luminosity may carry a large systematic error",
    "since it is strongly dependent on how the baseline of the broadening function is drawn ; in fact , this luminosity ratio implies @xmath92 , which poorly agrees with the direct magnitude difference given in the wds catalog ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the third component was observed to have the mean velocity of @xmath94 km  s@xmath12 ( a single observation @xmath95 km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "fo  vir is a totally eclipsing , detached or semi - detached binary , with the larger component close to filling the roche lobe , thus possibly an object in the pre - contact state .",
    "an extensive discussion of its properties , following the photometric study of @xcite who established its binary character , was presented by @xcite . on the basis of photometry and radial velocities of the dominant a7v component",
    ", they were able to infer many parameters of the system , in particular they predicted the mass ratio , @xmath96 , in a semi - detached system with the more massive component filling or almost filling its roche lobe .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite .",
    "we have been able to detect the secondary component of fo  vir , but with some difficulty , because it is relatively small and faint at the observed mass ratio @xmath97 and much later spectral type than that of the a7v primary , probably early k. a somewhat indirect detection of the secondary was reported by @xcite who observed the lyman - alpha @xmath98 emission moving in anti - phase with the primary star and thus most likely related to the secondary ; their @xmath99 is in agreement with the current determination .",
    "we experienced difficulties with measuring the radial velocities of both components in the first half of the orbit ; this could be related to the previously reported strong and variable oconnell effect @xcite . in addition , the case of fo  vir confronted us with what may be a limitation of our broadening functions approach : we observed relatively strong ( similar to those of the secondary component ) , initially unexplained broadening - function features moving in phase with the primary .",
    "we suspect that these `` ghosts '' may appear because of the low metallicity of the primary component @xcite and a mismatch between the spectra of program and template stars ; we simply could not locate a proper , low metallicity template among bright standard stars .",
    "many tests and experiments with different templates give us assurance that the final orbital elements are secure ones , although certain element of uncertainty still remains .",
    "the radial velocity data for fo  vir may have to be re - interpreted when a better @xmath6 prediction for the duration of our observations ( 1997  2001 ) becomes available . with observations spanning four seasons , we could establish that the period must be shorter than that used by the hipparcos project ( 0.775569 ) and we used one which is only by one digit in the last place shorter than that ; however , the period may be  in fact  systematically changing so that a full discussion is clearly in order , especially in view of a possibly sporadic mass transfer in the system .",
    "our @xmath6 is shifted by 50 minutes from the time predicted by the hipparcos project .",
    "a re - discussion of rather few available moments of minima for 1983  1991 gave @xmath100 , which we took as a guidance for adopting a shorter period , but which nevertheless resulted in the spectroscopic @xmath6 for our program too early by 40 minutes .",
    "fo  vir is a member of a visual binary wds  13298 + 0106 , but the companion is some 6.5 fainter so that its presence was of no consequence for the spectroscopic observations .",
    "this paper presents radial - velocity data and orbital solutions for the ninth group of ten close binary systems observed at the david dunlap observatory .",
    "this group contains very interesting objects : ks  peg and iw  per are single - line ( sb1 ) binaries without any traces of companions ; the former may have a very small - mass secondary ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "v395  and , hs  aqr and v449  aur are very close , early - type binaries ; the matter of them being detached systems requires further work ; v395  and with its spectral type of b7/8 is particularly interesting because of its orbital period of only 0.685 days .",
    "fp  boo , sw  lac , v592  per and tu  umi are contact binaries .",
    "two of them , v592  per and tu  umi , have bright tertiary companions , while fp  boo is a very small mass - ratio ( @xmath101 ) contact binary .",
    "the frequently observed system sw  lac is more massive than estimated before ; its broadening functions show the large surface brightness and rather compact dimensions of its secondary component , both possibly indicating that it is really a semi - detached binary and not a contact system .",
    "finally , we have been able to detect the low - mass secondary in fo  vir ( @xmath102 ) ; the system is most probably a semi - detached binary before establishing contact .",
