    "models of noncommutative space - time have become increasingly popular recently and are believed to be reasonable candidates for planck scale physics .",
    "the main idea is that in the scales where quantum theory and general relativity are no longer independent , the notion of a point in space - time becomes meaningless and a finite minimal length or uncertainty relation will have to be postulated for the coordinate functions in order to prohibit the localization of points with arbitrary high precision .",
    "models with uncertainty relations are usually implemented by considering noncommutative coordinate operators : @xmath4=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] where @xmath5 is a real and antisymmetric tensor and is of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "field theories on noncommutative space - time have received a great deal of attention , not least because they arise naturally in a particular seiberg - witten limit @xcite of string theory ( see @xcite ) for reviews .",
    "noncommutative field theories are constructed from conventional ( commutative ) field theory by replacing in the lagrangian the usual multiplication of fields with the @xmath7-product of fields , ( ) ( x)=(x)e^^__(x )    the parameter @xmath5 then appears in the vertices of perturbation theory and defines a second mass scale in the theory , called noncommutativity scale @xmath0 . in general , for any noncommutative field theory , the loop diagrams can be classified into the so - called `` planar '' and `` non - planar '' graphs where the planar part of diagrams show the same uv divergence structure as the corresponding commutative theory , while the non - planar pieces are uv finite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether these theories are renormalizable .",
    "the uv renormalizability of noncommutative field theories have been investigated using counter term @xcite and using wilson - polchinski method @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbation calculations show the noncommutative field theories to be afflicted from an endemic nontrivial mixing of ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the wilsonian approach to field theory seems to break down . here",
    "the high energy modes of the noncommutative theory can not be decoupled because integrating out high energy degrees of freedom produces unexpected low energy divergences induced in the infrared operators of negative dimension @xcite . generally speaking , in every quantum field theory formulated on a noncommutative space - time",
    ", we will have problems defining low energy wilsonian effective action since uv and ir scales do not decouple .",
    "this lack of decoupling of different scales in the theory might pose serious problems for phenomenology , since noncommutative effects can show up at low energies interfering with standard model predictions @xcite .",
    "however , the ordinary soft and collinear divergences are decoupled from noncommutative ir divergences and there is no mixing between them @xcite .",
    "recently the renormalizability of noncommutative field theories have been investigated by introducing a harmonic oscillatory term in the free part of lagrangian .",

    "we propose a new approach to recover the wilsonian effective action .",
    "our main assumption is that there is an infrared cut - off @xmath0 under which noncommutativity can not be probed and space - time becomes commutative continuously . at energies below @xmath0 , physics of all degrees of freedom is governed by a commutative theory .",
    "the scale @xmath0 can be equal to the scale of validity of an ordinary quantum field theory description of nature that is probably around @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "so we can probe a truly noncommutative behavior only in the range @xmath9 . here , the ultraviolet cut - off",

    "now the wilsonian effective action can be obtained for noncommutative @xmath1 and @xmath2 by integrating out the noncommutative high energy fields .",
    "the feature of these effective theories is that they are free from noncommutative ir divergences or uv / ir mixing .",

    "we also discus the positivity constraint @xcite on coefficients of higher dimensional terms . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the noncommutative extra dimensions and how the uv / ir mixing can be canceled out in the perturbation calculation .",
    "in this section we first review the renormalization of noncommutative @xmath1 theory @xcite using the wilsonian flow equation formulated by polchinski @xcite .",

    "the proof of renormalizability is based on the scaling behavior of relevant and irrelevant operators . in order to simplify the power counting , we assume the following relations to hold between scales , _ 01 , _ nc_0 the uv renormalizability can be proved using induction at any order of perturbation . at one - loop level , the uv cut - off @xmath10 is removed from operators @xcite .",

    "when the ir region ( @xmath32 ) comes under scrutiny , the wilsonian picture breaks down because of the uv / ir phenomena , and the low energy predictions under the scale @xmath33 become highly sensitive to the details of the ultraviolet sector of the theory . in order to write down a wilsonian effective action which correctly describes the low momentum behavior of the theory",
    ", one may add a new degree of freedom @xmath34 to the commutative action @xcite .",
    "then , the modified wilsonian action gets the following form s_eff()=s_eff ( ) + d^4x(()^2+^2(^2)^2 + ig ) integrating out the new mode in the region @xmath35 gives the quadratic infrared singularity @xmath36 appearing in the self energy diagrams ( 5 ) @xcite .    there is also a new approach developed by grosse and wulkenhaar in @xcite where it is shown that noncommutative four dimensional field theories are renormalizable to all orders of perturbation .",
    "this method also is a solution to uv / ir mixing problem .",
    "this work is performed by adding a new harmonic oscillator term to the free part of the action ,    s()=d^4x ( _ ^+(_)(^ ) + ) where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "this additional new term causes that the theory to be invariant under a sort of duality transformation between positions and momenta at @xmath39 ( away from this special point , it is more precise to say that the model is covariant ) @xcite .",
    "a main difference between this theory and ordinary noncommutative theories is that a free particle is affected by noncommutativity of space - time i.e. its propagator and also dispersion relation are modified without any interaction . in momentum space ,",
    "working with this theory and specially deriving the propagators is quite hard and is done only in a matrix representation form .",
    "although if one work in a x - space formalism @xcite , it seems that to some extent , this cumbersome theory is simplified .    in the following section , we explain a new idea which is a physical realization of mathematical view point of reference @xcite and derive an effective action .",
    "however , in this paper we do not use a minkowski space - time and perform our calculation with a euclidean signature . in this method",
    "we introduce a scale where space starts to be noncommutative , and by integrating out the noncommutative fields with momenta beyond this scale , we get an effective theory which is free from uv / ir mixing .",
    "the harmonic oscillator term @xmath40 does not change our result because the integration domain begins from a scale where beyond it this term become irrelevant .",
    "so we only use the usual noncommutative field theory as we only need to integrate out high energy modes .",
    "in ordinary field theory , low - energy dynamics ( large distances ) does not depend on details of high energy dynamics ( short distance ) . using wilson s method",
    ", one can decouple the high energy modes and obtain an effective field theory which has the same infrared behaviour as the underlying fundamental theory . in noncommutative field theory ,",
    "the high energy modes are not decoupled because of uv / ir phenomena and the wilsonian approach to effective field theory seems to break down . however , making a new assumption we start to rederive a well - behaved wilsonian effective action for noncommutative @xmath1 and @xmath2 theories . at first , we turn to noncommutative @xmath1 and write the generating functional for it in the @xmath41-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "here we consider the grosse - wulkenhaar term , z=(-d^dx )    we now divide the integration variables @xmath42 into two groups , those with @xmath43 and those with @xmath44 .",
    "the main assumption in our calculation is to suppose that the noncommutative behaviour can be detected in the range of energies beyond @xmath0 and that below this scale the theory becomes to be continuously commutative .",
    "so we define the fields @xmath45 with the momentum @xmath46 to have an ordinary ( commutative ) behavior and the fields @xmath47 with the momentum @xmath48 to have noncommutative behavior",
    ". then we can replace the old field @xmath45 by @xmath49 .",
    "the eq.(19 ) without the harmonic oscillator term is given by , z=(-d^dx )    here by expanding the terms in ( 20 ) , a new problem will appear . because of previous assumptions about @xmath45 and @xmath50 we can write & & = + & & = + & & = i.e. the product becomes commutative one whenever one of fields which is being multiplied has a momentum which is less than the noncommutative scale .",
    "the ambiguity is appeared when for example we consider a product such as @xmath51 . since    ( + ) = [ ( + ) ( + ) ]",
    "( + ) it does not matter which one we take to expand .",
    "if we expand the left side so the terms that are linear in @xmath50 are & & ( ) + & & ( ) + & & ( ) the first two can be evaluated easily according to the rule above and give @xmath52 . however the last one gives ( ) = ( ^2 ) now the modes in @xmath53 will have momentum which is a sum of those coming from the two @xmath45 s .",
    "so even if @xmath45 contain only modes with low momentum , the @xmath53 will contain modes with momentum larger than the scale @xmath0 and so one can not assume @xmath53 has commutative behavior .",
    "in order to solve this ambiguity it seems that in a more fundamental treatment we must find a symmetry breaking mechanism to deal with the high and low energy modes .",
    "however , in lack of such a theory we may continue with some approximations in our calculations .",
    "for example , in the terms such as @xmath53 we can approximately ignore some modes whose momentum become larger than @xmath0 in comparison with high momentum modes of @xmath50 and then we have ,    z = e^-()&&(-d^dx ) where @xmath54 is the commutative lagrangian .",
    "now we can ignore the @xmath55 term since this term is highly irrelevant in short distances or equivalently in energies above @xmath0 .",
    "integrating out all @xmath47s with the momentum @xmath48 , transforms ( 25 ) into the following form z = e^-s_eff(;_nc ) where @xmath56 is the deformed wilsonian effective action .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian density will finally be rewritten as follows : _",
    "eff(;_nc)&&=z(_nc)_^+m^2(_nc)^2+g(_nc)^4 + & & + _ ic_n , d , i(_nc)o_n , d , i where the terms @xmath57 are all irrelevant local operators with the dimension @xmath58 and consist of all the terms that can be constructed out of an even number @xmath59 of @xmath45 fields with @xmath41 number of derivatives acting on them .",
    "the index @xmath60 keeps track of operators with the same values of @xmath61 and @xmath41 that are not equivalent after integration by parts .",
    "we will show explicitly the dependence of coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 s on the noncommutative parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the crucial feature of ( 27 ) is that the uv / ir mixing problem is solved naturally in it .",
    "also the coefficients @xmath63 satisfy the positivity constraint discussed in @xcite in order for the low energy effective theory to be uv complete into a full theory .",

    "an interpretation for these continuums of degrees of freedom @xmath104 is that they are the transverse momentum modes of a particle @xmath107 which propagates freely in extra dimensions .",
    "it may be imagined that a d - dimensional space in which the @xmath45 particles propagate is a flat d - dimensional brane residing in a d+n dimensional space .",
    "the @xmath107 particles propagate freely in d+n dimensional space but couple to the @xmath45 particles on the brane ( located at @xmath108 ) .",
    "actually the theory with free @xmath107 particles in extra dimensions and coupling directly to @xmath45s on the brane is exactly equivalent to a theory with particles @xmath34 that live on the brane and have logarithmic propagators @xcite .",
    "these extra dimensions may be real or simply a mathematical convenience . in spite of this , it is not necessary in our approach to introduce extra dimensions since the wilsonian effective action that we rederived is free from noncommutative ir singularities . of course , even without continuum states @xmath104 , the world may have one or more compactified extra dimensions .",
    "it is possible that such compact dimensions are noncommutating @xcite . in the rest of this section",
    ", we will discuss these noncommutative extra dimensions in @xmath2 theory on @xmath13 ( @xcite ) where @xmath109 is a noncommutative two - torus whose coordinates @xmath110 and @xmath111 satisfy = i.    since coordinates @xmath110 and @xmath111 have been compactified on a rectangular torus with boundary conditions @xmath112 , the momentum along the compact dimensions are quantized as @xmath113 where @xmath114 are integers . to perform the perturbative calculation ,",
    "it is better to separate field @xmath45 as the commutative fields @xmath115 containing @xmath116 and the noncommutative fields @xmath117 containing all modes with nonvanishing @xmath118 .",
    "we make this separation as follows , _ 0=dx^4dx^5 , and = -_0 . in terms of these definitions ,",
    "the partition function ( 57 ) in six dimensions gets the form , z=(-d^6x ) .",
    "note that the relation between compactification scale @xmath119 and @xmath0 is unknown .",
    "naturally , there are two possibilities about their relation : @xmath120 or @xmath121 . if @xmath120 ( for example @xmath122 few tev ) , the extra dimensions are first probed and then noncommutative effects appear continuously beyond the scale @xmath0 .",
    "so , as in the previous section , we can separate the @xmath117 fields into commutative @xmath117 fields and noncommutative @xmath123 fields with the momentum @xmath9 . from the wilsonian point of view , the @xmath123 fields are integrated out when we calculate the effective action .",
    "so we get an ordinary @xmath2 theory compactified on @xmath124 .",
    "the noncommutativity parameter @xmath64 appears in renormalized mass and coupling constant with a series of higher order irrelevant operators . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath125 , the situation will be different . here ,",
    "the extra dimensions are noncommutative at all scales . in this region",
    ", the perturbation calculation of nonplanar diagrams shows that the one loop self energy for @xmath126 gets the form @xcite , = -(+m^2()+ )    so the one loop effective action @xmath127 contains quadratic and logarithmic ir singularities .",
    "while if @xmath128 is so large that @xmath129 , the effective action is free from the uv / ir mixing problem .",
    "we have derived a consistent wilsonian effective field theory for noncommutative @xmath1 and @xmath2 theories .",
    "the effects of noncommutativity appears in mass , coupling constant and the @xmath63 , the coefficients of higher order operators .",
    "we have shown that the noncommutative effective @xmath2 and @xmath1 theories are free from the uv / ir mixing problem in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , all order calculations can also have a soft behaviour and this result is natural in consequence of our assumption that beyond the scale @xmath0 , the noncommutative effects can be probed .",
    "below this scale , space - time becomes commutative continuously .",
    "we also studied the positivity constraint on the coefficients of the higher order irrelevant operator .",
    "these coefficients satisfy this constraint up to one loop explicitly .",
    "the noncommutative extra dimensions were considered in the noncommutative @xmath2 model .",
    "our results show that if the extra dimensions are large such that @xmath130 , the noncommutative ir divergences or uv / ir mixing could disappear . for a similar idea to what is proposed in this paper but in a different context see @xcite , and also @xcite .",
