    "asteroseismology is a powerful method for determining fundamental properties of stars .",
    "this is because oscillation frequencies give strong constraints on the internal structure that are independent of classical observations .",
    "observations of solar - like oscillations are accumulating rapidly , and measurement have recently be reported for several main - sequence and subgiant stars , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hd  49933 @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of these stars have solar metallicity or greater .",
    "asteroseismology is particularly useful for constraining the evolutionary status of stars with low metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ", we report the first oscillation measurements of a metal - poor star .",
    "we have observed the subgiant ( hr  8515 ; hd 211998 ; hip 110618 ) , whose iron abundance is only 3% of solar .",
    "we adopt the following stellar parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath3k , @xmath4 and @xmath5}=-1.4\\pm0.1 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that the bright star catalogue @xcite incorrectly lists this star as a binary with spectral types a3v:+f9v .",
    "in fact , is a single star with spectral type  g0 @xcite .",
    "we observed in august 2002 from two sites . at siding spring observatory in australia",
    "we used ucles ( university college london echelle spectrograph ) with the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "an iodine absorption cell was used to provide a stable wavelength reference , with the same setup that we have previously used with this spectrograph @xcite . at the european southern observatory on la silla in chile we used the coralie spectrograph with the 1.2-m swiss telescope .",
    "a thorium emission lamp was used to provide a stable wavelength reference , and the velocities were processed using the method described by @xcite .    with ucles we obtained 680 spectra of , with typical exposure times of 300s ( but sometimes as short as 200s in the best conditions ) and a dead time between exposures of 61s .",
    "with coralie we obtained 521 spectra , with typical exposure times of 360s and a dead time between exposures of 128s .",
    "the resulting velocities , with nightly means subtracted , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.series ] .",
    "as can be seen , the weather was good in australia but poor in chile ( we were allocated seven nights with ucles and 14 with coralie ) .    most of the scatter in the velocities , especially for ucles , is due to oscillations .",
    "figure  [ fig.best ] shows a close - up of the first night .",
    "oscillations with a period of about 50min and variable amplitude ( due to beating between modes ) are visible here and throughout the time series .",
    "we also see good agreement between the two instruments , within measurement uncertainties , during the overlap ( although we should note that the difference in absolute velocities is not known and has been adjusted to give the best fit ) .",
    "our analysis of these velocities follows the method that we developed for @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have used the measurement uncertainties , @xmath6 , as weights in calculating the power spectrum ( according to @xmath7 ) , but modified some of the weights to account for a small fraction of bad data points . in this case , 4 data points from ucles and 24 from coralie needed to be down - weighted .",
    "the power spectra of the individual time series and of the combination are shown in fig .  [ fig.power ] .",
    "the differences between the three panels can be attributed to the effects of beating between modes .",
    "the low metallicity of means that the lines in its spectrum are fewer and weaker than for stars of solar metallicity .",
    "this , together with its relative faintness ( @xmath8 ) , means that the doppler precision for is poorer than for other stars observed with the same instruments , such as and  b. we measured the average noise in the amplitude spectrum of at frequencies above the stellar signal ( 0.61mhz ) to be 17.3 for ucles , 27.2 for coralie and 14.9 for the combined data . using these values",
    ", we calculated the noise per minute of observing time to be 5.9 for ucles and 9.5 for coralie , where the difference is due to a combination of factors , primarily the telescope aperture but also including spectrograph design , sky conditions and observing duty cycle .",
    "the inset in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] shows the spectral window ( the response to a single pure sinusoid ) . for the single - site data we see sidelobes at @xmath9 that are very strong ( 51% in power for ucles and 57% for coralie ) .",
    "these are due to daytime gaps in the observing window . when the data are combined , the sidelobes are drastically reduced ( to 16% in power ) and are also slightly shifted , occurring at @xmath10 . in the cases of and",
    "b , we generated power spectra in which the weights were adjusted on a night - by - night basis in order to minimize the sidelobes .",
    "we have not done that for because the sidelobes for the two - site data are already quite low .",
    "mode frequencies for low - degree p - mode oscillations are approximated reasonably well by a regular series of peaks : @xmath11 here @xmath12 ( the radial order ) and @xmath13 ( the angular degree ) are integers , @xmath14 ( the large separation ) depends on the sound travel time across the whole star , @xmath15 is sensitive to the sound speed near the core and @xmath16 is sensitive to the surface layers .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review of the theory of solar - like oscillations .",
    "the large separation , @xmath14 , is proportional to the square root of the mean density of the star . scaling from the sun , for which @xmath17",
    ", we expect to have a large separation of about 25 . in order to search for a regular series of peaks from which to measure the large separation , we calculated the autocorrelation function of the power spectrum .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.acorr ] and the peak at 10.8 ( dashed line ) is the main sidelobe caused by the daily gaps ( see above ) .",
    "we interpret the peak at 24.5 as due to the large separation , with smaller peaks at @xmath18 from this being due to daily aliases ( the peak at 13 also coincides with half the large separation ) .",
    "the peak at 5 is not easily explained by the regular p - mode structure and may reflect departures of a few modes from the asymptotic relation in equation  [ eq.asymptotic ] .    as a check of this result",
    ", we also measured the large separation directly from the light curve data using bayesian methods ( see @xcite for a good introduction to bayesian analysis ) .",
    "we modelled the light curve as a sum of sinusoids , where the number of sinusoids , together with their amplitudes , phases and frequencies , were treated as unknowns .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that the amplitudes and phases can be integrated out of the problem at the beginning @xcite , so that we only need to fit the frequencies and their number .",
    "to determine the large separation , we chose the prior distribution for the frequencies to be periodic , with period @xmath19 ( considered unknown ) .",
    "we fixed the central frequency of this periodic comb to be the highest peak in the power spectrum ( 313.14 ) .",
    "we then calculated the posterior distribution for @xmath20 , which is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.bayes ] .",
    "there is a single strong peak with a value of @xmath0hz , in agreement with the peak of the autocorrelation .",
    "more details of this method , which is similar to the approach used by @xcite and appears to be very promising for this type of analysis , will be presented separately ( b. brewer et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "what can we learn about from our measurement of ?",
    "figure  [ fig.hr ] shows the location of the star in the h - r diagram , together with some theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "the box , which is the same in each panel , shows the observed position of from classical measurements .",
    "the value for ( @xmath21k ) is the mean of published photometric estimates @xcite , where we note the large uncertainty in the effective temperature scale for metal - poor stars .",
    "the luminosity is based on the hipparcos parallax ( @xmath22mas ) , with bolometric corrections from @xcite .",
    "note that the bolometric correction is a function of effective temperature , hence the slope of the box .",
    "the diagonal dashed lines , which are also the same in each panel , are loci of constant radius , calculated from @xmath23 .",
    "we can immediately see that a measurement of the radius from interferometry would be valuable in constraining the location of the star in the h - r diagram , as has already been shown for other stars @xcite .",
    "the curved lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.hr ] are evolutionary tracks for a range of masses , using model calculations similar to those by @xcite .",
    "we used a metallicity of @xmath24 ( with hydrogen and helium mass fractions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) and the three panels differ in the adopted value of the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath27 1.8 and  1.9 ) , where the solar value is @xmath28 .",
    "the relatively rapid evolution in this subgiant phase means each track can be described by a single age , as shown in the figure . finally , the diagonal lines are contours of constant @xmath14 .",
    "we calculated these from the evolutionary models by scaling from the sun ( since @xmath14 is proportional to the square root of the mean density ) .",
    "we see that our measurement of @xmath14 significantly constrains the parameters of .",
    "this is quantified in fig .",
    "[ fig.params ] , in which the thin error bars show the range of each parameter based on classical measurements alone ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , while the thick bars show the situation after we have added the constraint provided by our measurement of @xmath31 . including this constraint",
    "reduces the uncertainty in both effective temperature and radius , for a given value of @xmath32 , by a factor of four .",
    "what can we say about the mass of ? even with no constraints from seismology , the requirement that be younger than the universe ( 13.7gyr ; @xcite ) sets a lower limit of @xmath33 .",
    "a star of lower mass would not have had time to evolve this far .",
    "note that this limit , which we derived from the tracks in fig .",
    "[ fig.params ] , is essentially independent of the mixing length .",
    "this is because the value of @xmath32 has little effect on the fusion rate in the core , and hence on the time for a star of given mass to leave the main sequence and enter the subgiant phase .",
    "meanwhile , an upper limit on the mass is obtained from our measurement of @xmath31 , provided we also set a lower limit on @xmath32 ( third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.params ] ) . adopting a plausible lower limit of @xmath34",
    "gives an upper limit for the mass of @xmath35 .",
    "we can also set interesting limits on the age of .",
    "from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.params ] , and again setting @xmath36 as a plausible limit , we see that the age must be at least 9gyr .",
    "this confirms that is , indeed , very old and must have been formed very early in the history of the galaxy .",
    "the final results of our analysis are summarized in table  [ tab.params ] , where we list our best estimates for the parameters of , assuming that @xmath24 and @xmath37 .    with the data currently available ,",
    "what constraints can we set on the mixing length ?",
    "the dashed line at an age of 13.7gyr in fig .",
    "[ fig.params ] indicates the upper limit set by age of the universe .",
    "this indicates that the mixing length can not be greater than 2.1 .",
    "we expect much stronger constraints on @xmath32 , and also on the other stellar parameters , to come from the individual oscillation frequencies .",
    "the extraction of these frequencies and a comparison with theoretical models is deferred to a future paper ( f. carrier et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "an accurate measurement of the radius using interferometry would also be extremely valuable .",
    "the amplitudes of individual modes are affected by the stochastic nature of the excitation and by the ( unknown ) value of the mode lifetime . to measure the oscillation amplitude of in a way that is independent of these effects , we have followed the method introduced by @xcite . in brief",
    ", this involves the following steps : ( i )  smoothing the power spectrum heavily to produce a single hump of excess power that is insensitive to the fact that the oscillation spectrum has discrete peaks ; ( ii )  converting to power density by multiplying by the effective length of the observing run ( 4.42d , which we calculated from the area under the spectral window in power ) ; ( iii )  fitting and subtracting the background noise ; and ( vi )  multiplying by @xmath38 and taking the square root , in order to convert to amplitude per oscillation mode . for more details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.ampsmooth ] .",
    "the peak amplitude per mode is 0.95 , which occurs at a frequency of @xmath39 ( period 52min ) .",
    "this value of @xmath40 is consistent with that expected from scaling the acoustic cutoff frequency of the sun @xcite .",
    "the observed peak amplitude is 4.6 times the solar value , when the latter is measured using stellar techniques @xcite , which is substantially less than the value of 7.3 expected from the @xmath41 scaling proposed by @xcite but is in good agreement with the @xmath42 scaling suggested for main - sequence stars by @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the mode lifetimes in would be particularly useful .",
    "we have observed solar - like oscillations in the metal - poor subgiant star and measured the large frequency separation .",
    "we used this , together with the location of the star in the h - r diagram and standard evolutionary models , to place constraints on the stellar parameters .",
    "our results , summarized in table  [ tab.params ] , confirm that has a low mass and a large age and represent the first application of asteroseismology to a metal - poor star .",
    "further constraints on the parameters , particularly the mixing length , should come from comparing individual oscillation frequencies with theoretical models .",
