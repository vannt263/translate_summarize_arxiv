    "the hamiltonian matrix is well structured ( e.g. cyclic band diagonal ) . for topologically disordered glasses with conserved local order ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is structured similarly to that for the crystalline counterpart ( with the same local order ) but now , due to the presence of topological disorder : ( i ) the positions of elements are distributed about their positions in the crystalline matrix ( locational disorder ) and ( ii ) the values of the elements are also distributed because of different interatomic distances .",

    "[ distr](c ) ) , which corresponds to the first peak in the pair correlation function @xcite .",
    "the simplest model distribution which can mimic the function @xmath48 ( at least its scale ) is the box distribution ( the dashed line in fig .",

    "the distribution of the off - diagonal elements in the off - diagonal blocks ( see fig .  [ distr](d ) ) has a maximum at zero and is symmetric about it .",

    "these two boxes overlap around zero , thus resulting in a box - shaped peak in this region , i.e. the distribution function @xmath50 becomes closer in shape to the peak - shaped function @xmath51 .",
    "the above comparison demonstrates that the very simple disordered - lattice model with a box distribution of force constants is able to reproduce correctly the ranges of the distributions of the hamiltonian matrix elements for a topologically disordered glass with minimal short - range order ( i.e. the ic - glass ) .",
    "this leads to the plausible conjecture that the physical origins of different phenomena , such as the boson peak , ioffe - regel crossover and secondary peak in the dynamic structure factor ( analysed below ) , localization - delocalization transition , etc . , are common for topologically disordered glasses and disordered lattices .    the other important point to emerge concerns the possibility of estimating the degree of disorder in disordered - lattice models at which they are able to mimic glassy models .",
    "for small disorder , all the distributions for the disordered - lattice model presented in fig .",
    "[ distr ] are quite narrow and are not comparable in width with the distributions for the glassy model .",
    "they become similar only for sufficiently large disorder ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "below we use the simplest ( box ) distribution of force constants which allows us to analyse the problem analytically and which mimics some of the features of topologically disordered glasses by disordered lattices . a natural extension of the lattice models",
    "is in the use of more realistic force - constant distributions for crystalline counterparts of topologically disordered glasses and a comparison of the resulting properties of such models with the corresponding glasses .",

    "the elements of such a matrix do not exhibit locational disorder and only their values are distributed . using temperature as a control parameter it is possible to obtain the distributions of matrix elements very similar to those ones for the topologically disordered ic - glass ( see fig .  6 in ref .",
    "the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) for instantaneous configurations of the @xmath56-phase , as a consequence of such a similarity , resembles the vdos for the ic - glass @xcite .",
    "this supports the use of lattice models for mimicking topologically disordered structures .",

    "the dynamical structure factor differs from the spectral density and contains an additional decaying energy ( frequency ) function ( see eq .",

    "this results in a weaker dependence of the dynamic structure factor , which shows , in this intermediate frequency range , either the shoulder - like behaviour , if the wavevector magnitude is not large enough and the low - frequency tail of the brillouin peak plays a significant role ( see the long and short dashed lines in fig .  [ sd_1 ] ) , or a secondary peak for large values of @xmath170 ( see the solid line in fig .  [ sd_1 ] ) , when the influence of the brillouin peak is suppressed by the @xmath179 function in eq .",
