    "the statistical treatment of systems driven far from equilibrium presents exciting theoretical challenges @xcite . lacking the unified understanding afforded equilibrium phenomena by the work of boltzmann and gibbs",
    ", we are exploring unknown territory without recourse to an established theory .",
    "our physical intuition , developed in the context of equilibrium systems , can be misleading when faced with nonequilibrium problems .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to computational ` experiments ' in which a manifestly nonequilibrium state can be established and studied , seeking to identify key features shared by many nonequilibrium systems . while real physical systems are unquestionably important , complications and subtle details may obscure such common features . while motivated by realistic problems , microscopic rules and boundary conditions are chosen simple enough to facilitate a comprehensive computational study of the full parameter space .",
    "many of the questions relevant in equilibrium remain interesting , especially as concern the nature of phase transitions and the principle of universality .",
    "the richness of nonequilibrium phenomena is often surprising , as the relaxation of the detailed balance constraint allows a variety of unexpected possibilities : in contrast to equilibrium , the _ dynamics _ now affects the stationary ( long - time ) properties of the system .",
    "particularly dramatic effects have been observed in models where the violation of detailed balance is combined with spatial anisotropies and dynamic conservation laws @xcite .",
    "there , _ effective _ long - range interactions can be induced even if the microscopic rules are perfectly local in space and time @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model from this class , namely , a lattice gas of two species of particles and holes on a fully periodic lattice in two spatial dimensions .",
    "to drive the system out of equilibrium , we bias the hopping rates of the two species in opposite directions , reminiscent of an ` electric ' field , @xmath0 , acting on opposite ` charges ' ( though we stress that there is _ no coulomb interaction _ ) . a nonzero charge current signals the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "the two species interact through an excluded volume constraint and nearest - neighbor attractions .",
    "we choose the interactions carefully , in order to unify three important models which appear as limiting cases of our more general theory .",
    "first , by letting all particles attract each other , irrespective of their identity ( charge ) , the non - driven limit corresponds to the familiar ising lattice gas @xcite .",
    "this well - known equilibrium model will serve as an anchor for our studies of driven systems . turning the bias on but removing all members of one species",
    ", we recover the _ driven _ ising lattice gas introduced by katz et al kls ( the kls model ) .",
    "the third limit , obtained by letting the interaction strength vanish , corresponds to a non - interacting two - species model first proposed by schmittmann et al @xcite ( the shz model ) .",
    "while the klsmodel phase - separates , via a continuous transition , into high- and low - density strips _ aligned _ with the field @xcite , the shz model orders into _ transverse , _ charge- _ _  _ _ and mass - segregated , strips @xcite , similar to jamming instabilities in traffic models @xcite . if a charge imbalance is imposed , these strips drift @xcite . our study will allow us to bridge the gap between these very different scenarios . to set the scene , we briefly survey some of the relevant previous work .    as a single parameter modification of the ising lattice gas ,",
    "the kls model is a _ minimal model _ for the study of nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) .",
    "particle hops along one direction ( parallel to the @xmath1-axis ) occur at the normal equilibrium rate , as if in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "particle hops in the other direction ( parallel to the @xmath3-axis ) are enhanced ( suppressed ) in the positive ( negative ) direction by coupling to an external field , @xmath0 . with periodic boundaries in the @xmath3-direction , a nonzero current is maintained , and the system settles into a ness . at half - filling , there remains a continuous transition , though with @xmath4 increasing monotonically with @xmath0 and saturating at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the transition falls into a novel universality class with exponents distinct from the ising ones @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior is strongly anisotropic , with distinct sets of exponents characterizing fluctuations _",
    "perpendicular _ and _ parallel _ to @xmath0 .",
    "there has been some discussion regarding the nature of these fluctuations , with some authors disputing the original claim that the correct mesoscopic description is gaussian in the perpendicular direction @xcite .",
    "though the anisotropy makes numerical investigations of the critical behavior quite subtle and computationally intensive , recent high precision monte carlo studies compare the two mesoscopic descriptions .",
    "the results are in complete agreement with the predictions of the original field theory @xcite . as a final note",
    ", we mention that the combination of anisotropic dynamics and a conservation law introduces power law correlations at all @xmath6 eff - lr , a manifestation of the relaxation of the detailed balance constraint .",
    "these correlations are revealed by the structure factor , which has a discontinuity singularity at the origin . in this sense ,",
    "even the ` disordered ' phase is quite non - trivial .",
    "turning to multispecies versions , the simplest ( ` shz ' ) model @xcite allows _ two _ different types of particles , distinguished only by their interaction with the external field . positive ( negative ) particles are biased to hop in the positive ( negative ) @xmath3-direction , and interact only via an excluded volume constraint .",
    "the temperature is absorbed into @xmath0 and the only parameters are @xmath0 , the overall mass density @xmath7 , and the overall charge density ( i.e. , the density difference of the two species ) , @xmath8 . here , the mechanism for ordering is the mutual volume exclusion of the particles , so that at sufficiently strong @xmath0 and large @xmath7 , the system locks into a high density strip _ perpendicular _ to @xmath0 , with positive and negative particles blocking each other . for non - zero charge density @xmath8 , this strip is found to drift in the direction of the minority species @xcite .",
    "depending on where the phase boundary is crossed , first - order or continuous transitions are observed @xcite .",
    "various other remarkable properties have been discovered . for a range of aspect ratios , configurations with non - zero winding number ( ` barber poles ' )",
    "are quite frequently observed , _ in addition _ to the usual transverse strips , raising the possibility of bistability @xcite .",
    "power law correlations characterize the disordered phase , with _ directionality - dependent _ exponents @xcite .",
    "another subtle issue concerns the lower critical dimension : while an exact solution for a strictly one - dimensional model , characterized by a single ` lane ' parallel to @xmath0 , precludes a transition @xcite , monte carlo data for a ` two - lane ' model indicate the presence of a macroscopic cluster in finite systems @xcite .",
    "very subtle finite - size effects control the decay of this cluster in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the two - species model at finite @xmath2 and @xmath0 , where interparticle interactions are expected to play an important role . by varying @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath8 , the fraction of",
    "the _ total _ population which are of the _ minority _ species , we can interpolate smoothly from the kls model to the ( non - interacting ) two - species shz model . hence",
    ", we expect a competition between the two types of ordered configurations ",
    "parallel vs transverse strips  favored by these two limits .",
    "as @xmath8 varies from @xmath9 ( kls model ) to @xmath10 ( equal numbers of each ) , there should be some critical @xmath8 where the preferred order switches .",
    "to explore these phenomena in more detail , we map out the phase diagram in @xmath11 @xmath8 and @xmath2 , for a range of system sizes . the energy scale is set by our choice of the interparticle attraction @xmath12 , and the overall mass density @xmath7 is fixed at @xmath10 so that the ising critical point remains accessible .",
    "many questions arise in connection with earlier work .",
    "how do nearest - neighbor attractions modify the two - species transition ? what will be the effect of a few ` impurities ' ( i.e. , minority particles ) on the kls transition ? at what concentration do the ` impurities ' become relevant and change the nature of the transition ? preliminary results , focusing on a restricted parameter space , were already reported in @xcite ; here , we explore a much wider parameter range , including several system sizes .",
    "we will be able , if not to answer these questions fully , then to at least suggest the character of their resolution sufficiently to guide further research .",
    "our main results are as follows . at fixed @xmath0 and sufficiently small @xmath8",
    ", a line of continuous transitions emerges from the pure kls ( @xmath13 ) point , in the @xmath8-@xmath2 plane .",
    "this line separates the disordered phase from an ordered one , characterized by a particle - rich strip parallel to @xmath0 .",
    "as we increase @xmath8 , we encounter a bicritical point , where the transition line splits into a line of continuous order - disorder transitions , from disorder into a strip transverse to @xmath0 , and a line of first - order transitions along which transverse and parallel order coexist .",
    "if we fix @xmath8 and lower @xmath2 , we first observe the transition from disorder into the transverse strip , followed by a transition into parallel order .",
    "this topology persists at higher @xmath0 , except that all lines are shifted to slightly higher temperatures .",
    "the size - dependence of the phase diagram is subtle , since the main features are controlled by _",
    "different _ scaling variables . on the one hand ,",
    "the transition into the transverse strip is controlled by the _ effective _ drive @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the system size in the drive direction . on the other hand , the bicritical point appears to depend on the scaling variable @xmath16 which translates into the number of _ rows _ ( transverse to @xmath0 ) which can be filled with the minority species .",
    "finally , the pure kls point requires finite - size scaling at fixed shape factor @xmath17 @xcite , in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe in detail the microscopic model and the observables which are used to locate the different phases .",
    "we then present our simulation results , beginning with the structure of typical configurations in different parts of parameter space and their associated order parameters . by monitoring the signatures of first and second order transitions ,",
    "we compile a cut through the phase diagram at fixed @xmath0 , with variable @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "the phase boundaries and their dependence on system size are analyzed in some detail . to complete the picture , we present two cuts at different but fixed temperatures , crossing the phase boundaries by varying @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of some open questions .",
    "we consider periodic square lattices of size @xmath18 , in two spatial dimensions , with @xmath0 parallel to the ( positive ) @xmath3-axis .",
    "a configuration is specified by the set of occupation variables , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 takes three values , @xmath21 denoting a positive ( negative ) particle or a hole at lattice site @xmath22 . often , we will only need to distinguish particles from holes , via @xmath23 .",
    "all lattices are half filled , i.e. , @xmath24 , so that the ising critical point remains accessible .",
    "an important parameter is the fraction of negative particles ( the ` minority species ' ) in the system : @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , we only need to consider the sector @xmath26 , from having no negative particles at all to equal numbers of each species . for later reference",
    ", we also introduce the charge density , @xmath27 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor attraction is modelled by the ising hamiltonian @xmath28we choose attractive interactions , @xmath29 , regardless of species .",
    "while many other choices are possible and interesting , ours provides maximum linkage to known cases : ising , kls and shz .",
    "the monte carlo dynamics conserves the number of each species and is specified as follows .",
    "an update attempt begins by picking a bond at random .",
    "if the bond connects a particle - hole pair , the contents are exchanged with the metropolis rate @xmath30 \\right\\ } $ ] @xcite .",
    "hence , at @xmath31 we recover the equilibrium ising model with conserved magnetization , coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we will set @xmath32 and measure @xmath0 in units of this ( arbitrary ) energy scale .",
    "@xmath2 will be quoted in units of the onsager temperature , @xmath33 . the change in @xmath3-coordinate , due to the proposed move , is denoted by @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the associated change in internal energy .",
    "the term @xmath36 models the gain or loss of energy from the coupling to @xmath0 ; if @xmath37 is positive ( negative ) the move is favored ( unfavored ) .",
    "our model , in which @xmath0 and @xmath2 are varied independently , raises an interesting issue .",
    "if the ratio @xmath38 is quite large , it becomes almost impossible for particles to hop backwards . in a finite system",
    ", this implies that a relatively small fraction of the minority species  provided the ` right ' fluctuation occurs  is sufficient to form a stable blockage .",
    "even though such a fluctuation becomes less probable in a larger system , the dynamics nevertheless becomes nonergodic in the limit @xmath39 . in principle , this can be avoided by introducing , e.g. , a small probability for particles to exchange places @xcite . to limit the number of parameters",
    ", we circumvent these problems here by considering different initial configurations and a range of system sizes .",
    "the dynamics is diffusive , and therefore conserves both charge and mass density .",
    "though the _ local _ effect of the external field is analogous to the effect of an electrostatic potential on electric charges , the boundary conditions exclude the possibility of a _ global _ hamiltonian description .    as overall density",
    "is conserved , we expect ordered configurations to be strips of higher density coexisting with strips of lower density .",
    "we therefore introduce the fourier transform of the local mass variable , @xmath40which is labelled by ( integer ) wavenumbers , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the structure factor , @xmath43 then serves as a good order parameter , since it is sensitive to _ mass - segregated _ strip configurations . for example @xmath44",
    "will be @xmath45 for a strip aligned with the field , characteristic of kls order ; similarly , @xmath46 will detect a strip transverse to @xmath0 which develops in the shz ( two - species ) model ; and both are normalized to @xmath47 for a disordered configuration .",
    "we also monitor a ` susceptibility ' , i.e. the fluctuations of the order parameter : @xmath48   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that @xmath49 involves the fourier transform of the _ mass _ variable and is therefore not sensitive to any charge - segregated structures . replacing @xmath50 by @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) generates structure factors which respond to charge inhomogeneities .",
    "we have monitored these and their fluctuations throughout , and found that their behavior is consistent with the mass - based quantities .",
    "when @xmath52 is calculated , the average is taken over multiple steady - state configurations of a monte carlo run , with a typical run lasting @xmath53 m ( @xmath54 ) monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , and @xmath55 bond update attempts per mcs .",
    "data are collected every @xmath56 mcs ; fluctuations of observables indicate that this interval is sufficient to produce uncorrelated data in the largest @xmath57 systems considered .",
    "typically , the initial @xmath58 m mcs are discarded to ensure that data are taken from the steady state .",
    "near critical points and at low temperatures these numbers require modification , due to long correlation times and long - lived metastable states .",
    "in such cases the only recourse is a careful analysis of individual , very long runs . when that is necessary we will measure a quantity closely related to @xmath52 : @xmath59which measures the type of order present in a _",
    "single _ configuration .",
    "we can then track @xmath60 for different @xmath61 s and @xmath62 s over the course of a run and see precisely how the averages are generated .",
    "finally , at each bond update we tally the quantity @xmath63 , which is then averaged over a run to give the charge current @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is not particularly illuminating to compare @xmath65 for different values of the effective drive @xmath38 .",
    "we are more interested in a quantity which is a property of the gross structure of the steady state , namely , the conductivity @xmath66 defined via @xmath67 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    now that we have described the various quantities which will be used to probe the behavior of our model , we turn to the presentation of the data .",
    "in this section we seek the location and character of transitions by scanning in @xmath8 and @xmath2 at fixed drive @xmath0 .",
    "we choose @xmath68 since this intermediate value still allows for a significant fraction of backward jumps , thus avoiding the spurious metastable configurations discussed above . at the same time",
    ", it is large enough to induce measurable currents and other clear signatures of far - from - equilibrium behavior .",
    "the two order parameters @xmath44 and @xmath46 and their fluctuations are monitored in order to identify the different phases .",
    "large peaks in their fluctuations , or the presence of hysteresis , are used as indicators of continuous vs first order transitions , respectively . for clarity ,",
    "we first present a quick overview of the topology of the phase diagram , and then turn to the details of the data which underlie this picture .",
    "[ fig3 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the phase diagram in the @xmath8-@xmath2 plane , at @xmath68 , for two different system sizes .",
    "three phases are found : a homogeneous , disordered phase ( do ) , a transverse strip ( ts ) phase as in the two - species model , and a parallel strip ( ps ) phase as in the kls model .",
    "the value of @xmath8 determines which phase is observed : at @xmath69 there is only one species of particles , and a single transition is observed from disorder into the parallel strip . as @xmath8 increases , this transition persists until the number of the minority species is sufficient to create a blockage and form the transverse strip . from here",
    "on , _ two _ transitions are observed : from disorder into the transverse strip , and at a lower temperature from the transverse strip into the parallel strip . upon increasing @xmath8",
    "further , only the do - ts transition can be detected .",
    "although the ts - ps line can not have a critical endpoint for reasons of symmetry , for @xmath70 it occurs at such a low temperature that it can not be observed in simulations of a reasonable length .",
    "now that we have briefly discussed the phase diagram we can look in more detail at the phases and their boundaries . before presenting the data ( structure factors , their fluctuations , currents ) we will begin with some pictures of typical configurations at various points in the phase diagram . this way the reader can develop some intuition about the model .",
    "all pictures show @xmath71 lattices , with @xmath0 pointing up .",
    "white ( black ) pixels are positively ( negatively ) biased particles , blue - green ( gray in print ) pixels are holes .",
    "we will begin at the right side of the phase diagram and explore how typical configurations change as we move left , decreasing the fraction of the population which belongs to the minority species .",
    "[ fig5 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present four configurations at @xmath72 : the first picture is at @xmath73 , well above @xmath74",
    ". unsurprisingly , this configuration lacks any visible structure since it falls deep into the homogeneous phase .",
    "this will be the only picture presented for the homogeneous phase , as the only _ visible _ feature which changes with @xmath8 is the ratio of white to black pixels .",
    "the next picture is at @xmath75 , and now we begin to see the two - species type phase separation .",
    "lowering the temperature further to @xmath76 , the horizontal strip appears quite clearly , though it remains diffuse at the boundaries , and there are many ` travelers ' ( isolated particles ) moving through the remainder of the system . at this",
    "temperature backward hops of particles are not too improbable , occuring with a rate @xmath77 , and thus a fair number of holes are able to enter the strip and allow particles to slip through the blockage .",
    "finally at @xmath78 we are deeply inside the ordered phase , and the boundaries of the strip are very sharp and travelers are few . at this temperature , holes are rarely able to penetrate into the interior of the strip . the irregular shape of the interface between the two species is a result of the quench from disorder ; a more gradual lowering of the temperature would result in a smoother interface .",
    "lowering @xmath8 to @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , only @xmath80 rows of the minority species are left .",
    "the first frame shows a configuration just below criticality at @xmath81 .",
    "though a blockage can still form , the strip is no longer symmetric with respect to @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this leads to a drifting of the strip : occasionally , the rather thin blockage of the minority species is opened by backward hops , and the majority species pours through .",
    "these particles then travel quite rapidly around the periodic lattice and attach to the back of the majority blockage , the net result being an _ upward _ drift of the strip . lowering @xmath2 further to @xmath84 ( third frame ) it appears that interfaces _",
    "parallel _ to @xmath0 are becoming favorable ; this type of configuration is common at these intermediate values of @xmath8 : here , parallel and transverse strips compete with each other .",
    "indeed the final frame ( @xmath85 ) shows the preferred low temperature configuration : a single strip of _ mixed _ charge parallel to @xmath0 , raising the possibility of a sequence of _ two _ transitions as a function of @xmath2 .    now that we have developed a qualitative notion of the various regions in the phase diagram , we turn to a more quantitative analysis of the phases and their boundaries .",
    "as in the preceding section , we present the order parameters and their fluctuations as a function of @xmath2 , for a range of @xmath8 , though with one important difference : we will show data for at least _ two _ system sizes .",
    "while this can not replace a high - precision finite - size scaling analysis of the transitions , it is intended to provide a rough picture of how the fluctuations of the order parameter scale with system size .",
    "[ fig10 ]    we begin as before at @xmath72 , with equal numbers of each type of particle . in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] and  [ fig11 ] , @xmath86 and its fluctuations are plotted as a function of @xmath2 for two system sizes ( @xmath71 and @xmath87 ) ; @xmath88 is not shown as the only transition here is from the homogeneous phase into the transverse strip .",
    "in both systems , @xmath86 goes smoothly to zero as @xmath2 is increased",
    ". a clean peak in @xmath89 is also observed in each system , increasing in amplitude with the system size .",
    "these two observations are consistent with a continuous transition into the transverse strip at @xmath72 , and we therefore use the location of the peak in @xmath89 to locate the phase boundary in fig .  1 , with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    reducing @xmath8 to just a few rows of the minority species introduces some new features into the data , which we describe briefly before continuing our analysis . here",
    ", we still observe the transition described above , with the same behavior of @xmath86 and @xmath89 .",
    "however , now that the strip is no longer symmetric , it drifts .",
    "the ordered phase therefore fluctuates significantly , and @xmath92 develops a shoulder at about @xmath93 of the value it reaches at the transition .",
    "we will see below that the fluctuations of the ordered phase can obscure the transition in smaller systems .",
    "[ fig11 ]    [ fig14 ]    upon reducing @xmath8 further we observe a sequence of _ two transitions _ as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows both order parameters , @xmath86 and @xmath88 for @xmath80 rows of the minority species : @xmath94 in the @xmath71 system .",

    "[ fig15 ] is @xmath89 for @xmath80 rows of the minority species in both the @xmath71 and the @xmath87 system .",
    "we have omitted the @xmath87 data for the order parameters to keep the plot uncluttered .",
    "as before , @xmath86 and @xmath92 signal a continuous transition into the ts phase as @xmath2 is lowered , though the signal in @xmath89 is much more pronounced in the @xmath87 system . and also",
    "as before , there are significant fluctuations associated with this phase , due to strip drifting .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath87 system @xmath89 actually has a broad secondary peak in the ordered phase .",
    "the large magnitude of this signal is is quite unexpected and awaits a satisfactory explanation . for",
    "now , we only note that _ lowering _",
    "@xmath2 _ increases _ the effective bias , @xmath38 , and therefore enhances fluctuations associated with the drive .",
    "lowering @xmath2 further we observe @xmath86 falling abruptly , while @xmath88 climbs rapidly , suggesting a discontinuous transition from the horizontal strip ( ts ) into the vertical strip ( ps ) . in the neighborhood of such a transition ,",
    "one expects to see metastability of the unfavored phase , and this is indeed the case as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "here we have plotted _ time traces _ ( as opposed to configurational averages ) of structure factors for individual configurations , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , defined in eqn .",
    "( [ tt ] ) . clearly , when @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) @xmath97 the configuration is a perfect vertical ( horizontal ) strip .",
    "sufficiently close to the transition , the time traces reveal the expected behavior , as the system switches between the two ordered phases .",
    "notice the length of the run shown : @xmath98 m mcs , which is a factor of @xmath98 longer than typical runs , indicating that the lifetimes of metastable configurations are already quite long even in the @xmath71 system , rendering such behavior nearly unobservable in the @xmath87 system .",
    "[ fig15 ]    [ fig16 ]    at smaller values of @xmath8 we are nearing the junction of the three phase boundaries , which considerably complicates the analysis of data from small systems in a couple of ways . the sequence of transitions ( do - ts followed by ts - ps ) becomes difficult to resolve , as they are quite close in temperature , and massive fluctuations from the first - order ts - ps line may wash out the signal in @xmath89 which locates the continuous do - ts line . and",
    "if the junction of the three lines is indeed a nonequilibrium bicritical point , we can expect unexplored finite - size effects to interfere with the analysis .",
    "we can , however , make some progress based on the assumption that the relevant control parameter near the bicritical point is the number of rows of the minority species .",
    "this hypothesis will be treated in more detail below , in the sections on scaling arguments .    at precisely one row of the minority species it is no longer possible to accurately resolve the two transitions in the @xmath71 system .",
    "a weak transverse ordering is observed , with @xmath86 reaching at most @xmath99 of perfect order . in the vicinity of the ps - ts first - order transition , huge fluctuations associated with switching between metastable configurations",
    "are observed , which wash out the signal of the do - ps transition .",
    "however , it is interesting that these transitions can be resolved in larger systems at precisely one row of the minority species : there , these two transitions are sufficiently far apart in temperature since ( as we will see below ) @xmath100 increases with @xmath15 across the do - ts transition .",
    "this likely explains why the do - ts transition is not observed in the @xmath71 system .",

    "are observed in @xmath46 and especially @xmath101 , where the fluctuations are an order of magnitude larger than the signal at the do - ts boundary . in this region",
    "neither @xmath102 nor @xmath46 posesses a well - defined average ; timetraces indicate vigorous competition between the two ordered phases .",
    "we conjecture that we are close to the bicritical point in the finite system , and are therefore unable to resolve the transition without some knowledge of scaling to guide the analysis . at smaller",

    "@xmath101 shows the low - temperature configuration to be a single parallel strip , the smooth approach to zero again suggesting a continuous transition . and indeed , the data for @xmath103 is consistent with this conjecture , with a sharp peak which increases with system size .",
    "the amplitude of the peak is smaller by a factor of five than the peaks observed near the bicritical point , suggesting that it is associated with fluctuations about a well - defined average , as opposed to transitions into and out of the ordered phase .",

    "rather the maximal conductivity occurs in the disordered phase , but at a temperature which is not too large , so that backward hops are not so common as to begin reducing the current .",

    "we stress that this behavior is due to the proximity of the kls phase transition , not due to some residual competition with the transverse strip .",
    "finally , we note that the behavior of the susceptibility is consistent with a continuous transition into the parallel strip .",
    "the conductivities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig52 ] . at @xmath72 and @xmath120",

    "again , the peak corresponds to the crossing of the two order parameters , and then falls off with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this similarity suggests that perhaps the high @xmath0 phase at @xmath94 is in fact the parallel strip , and such behavior would be observed in a larger system . for values of @xmath8 below @xmath138",
    "we no longer observe the secondary peak , nor do we observe any phase competition .",
    "we must , however , leave questions about the nature of the high-@xmath0 phase open to further study .",
    "now that we have surveyed the phase diagram in some detail , we turn to look closely at some of the boundaries with the help of some scaling arguments . considering fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] again , we note two potentially troubling features .",
    "first , there is a shift in @xmath100 across the do - ts boundary of about @xmath154 between the two system sizes .",
    "we will characterize this shift using a mean - field scaling argument .",
    "second , we note that the bicritical point has shifted towards the @xmath69 axis in the larger system . it has been alluded to before that the number of rows of the minority species , rather than the fraction @xmath8 , might be the controlling variable .",
    "we will investigate this suggestion more carefully by considering some larger systems and rectangular geometries .",
    "finally we study the @xmath69 phase transition , using scaling arguments developed for the kls model .",
    "the shift in @xmath100 with system size is most pronounced at @xmath72 .",
    "previous work on the two - species model with @xmath155 treated the ordered phase in a mean - field approximation by solving equations of motion for the two different charge densities @xcite . * *  * * it was found that the scaling functions depend on the combination @xmath156 , indicating that the effective bias @xmath38 introduces a new length scale .",
    "this scaling implies an infinite - volume limit in which @xmath38 @xmath157 as @xmath158 , while keeping @xmath156 fixed .",
    "earlier analyses of the _ ordered phase _ based on these ideas have worked quite well , so that we now attempt to extend this approach to analyze quantities near criticality and    [ fig31 ]    [ fig32 ]    for @xmath159 .",
    "there is no reason to expect success a priori , as both critical fluctuations and nonzero @xmath12 may modify the scaling variables and the mean - field exponents . in figs .",
    "[ fig31 ] and  [ fig32 ] we have plotted @xmath46 and @xmath124 for @xmath160 .",
    "( we have divided @xmath124 , eqn .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , by the volume in order to compare different system sizes more easily . ) rather than crossing the phase boundary by varying @xmath2 we have opted instead to vary @xmath0 since this allows us to vary the effective bias @xmath38 at _ constant _ interaction strength , @xmath115 . while the collapse of @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig31 ] is not perfect , the mean - field scaling argument accounts for most of the shift in @xmath100 .",
    "there is a shift in the peak of @xmath161 of about @xmath162 between the largest and smallest systems ; if the same data were plotted without rescaling , the shift in @xmath163 is about @xmath164 . also of note",
    "is the extremely weak dependence on the transverse dimension , as predicted by the scaling argument .",
    "we also examined the same quantities for @xmath155 .",
    "interestingly , the data collapse for @xmath160 is better than in the @xmath155 case .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , as the original scaling argument was derived for @xmath155 , and we would expect the interactions to perhaps modify it .",
    "whatever the resolution of this puzzle , it is apparent that the scaling argument presented here explains the pronounced shift in @xmath100 seen in the phase diagram : increasing @xmath15 requires a corresponding decrease in the effective bias @xmath38 .",
    "another issue concerns the location of the junction of the three phase boundaries , shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the junction moves toward the @xmath69 axis as the system size is increased .",
    "in fact , in both systems the boundaries merge just below a _",
    "single row _ of the minority species , which naturally corresponds to a smaller @xmath8 in the larger system . in fig .",
    "[ fig33 ] we have replotted the data from fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ,    [ fig33 ]    replacing @xmath8 with @xmath165 , which is simply the _ number of rows _ of the minority species . near the junction of the three lines we have also included results from a few other system sizes with rectangular geometries . plotted vs.  @xmath165 ,",
    "the junctions of the boundaries coincide , within the error bars , for all system sizes , suggesting that the onset of the two - species order occurs , at least in relatively small finite systems , when there are sufficient minority particles to form a single row .",
    "the crucial question concerns the extrapolation of this result to an appropriate thermodynamic limit .",
    "if the system size goes to infinity in the most naive way , i.e. , @xmath166 at fixed aspect ratio @xmath167 , the particle density associated with a ` single row ' vanishes .",
    "it is possible that the do - ps transition exists in an infinite volume only at @xmath69 , and any _ finite density _ of ` disorder ' ( i.e. , the minority species ) induces the two - species order .",
    "preliminary studies @xcite indicate that the minority species does indeed constitute a relevant perturbation to the kls fixed point .",
    "we will have to leave discussion of this issue to future work and for now limit ourselves to statements about finite systems .    at @xmath69",
    "there is only one species , and we observe the kls transition at _ finite _ @xmath0 . though a great deal of study has been devoted to this transition at infinite @xmath0 , there has been no detailed work at finite @xmath0 .",
    "here we present a basic finite - size scaling ( fss )  analysis of this transition , in order to locate @xmath168 , and also to demonstrate the subtleties which can arise when studying phase transitions with anisotropic , nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "field - theoretic studies of the kls model @xcite indicate that the critical behavior is strongly anisotropic , meaning that correlation lengths diverge with different exponents in the field direction and perpendicular to the field .",
    "specifically , the fluctuations perpendicular to the field are gaussian @xmath169 while those parallel to the field are not @xmath170 .",
    "correlations therefore grow faster in the parallel direction as @xmath171 , suggesting an analysis of rectangular samples such that the anisotropic aspect ratio @xmath172 is held fixed @xcite . while there is some discussion regarding the correct mesoscopic model @xcite , detailed numerical simulations",
    "show that the exponents cited above are the correct ones @xcite . in the following",
    "we will use only the phenomenological result of leung for the scaling of the order parameter at fixed @xmath173 : @xmath174where @xmath52 refers to @xmath44 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the subtleties of the fss analysis for the kls model and precision numerical results can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ fig34 ] presents our data for the scaled order parameter at @xmath175 ; the same data for saturation @xmath0 can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this data is not intended as a test    [ fig34 ]    of the mesoscopic model , it merely is meant to indicate that the exponents at infinite @xmath0 are consistent with those at finite @xmath0 , and to determine @xmath176 .",
    "the data collapse is comparable to that seen at saturation @xmath0 , with the high temperature ( upper ) branch collapsing quite well and the low temperature ( lower ) branch showing small , but systematic deviations from scaling .",
    "these deviations remain unexplained .",
    "they are possibly due to corrections to scaling or perhaps the asymptotic region is only observed very close to @xmath100 .",
    "we have seen how subtle are the issues surrounding the transition at @xmath69 . perhaps a fruitful way to proceed when @xmath177 is to adopt the technique introduced by caracciolo _",
    "et al_. @xcite , directly measuring finite volume correlation lengths for various geometries and volumes . in this way",
    "we may develop some understanding of how to approach the infinite volume limit in a simple way , minimizing corrections to scaling which would complicate an uninformed analysis .",
    "we have compiled a detailed phase diagram for a system of two species of particles , interacting via attractive ising interactions , and driven into opposite directions by an external `` electic '' field , @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of our analysis was to unify previous studies which were restricted either to just one species or to having only excluded volume interactions . in the former case , particles order into a single strip aligned with the field direction while in the second model",
    ", the two oppositely driven species form a jam in the shape of a transverse strip .",
    "we monitor structure factors , their fluctuations , and , if necessary , their time traces to identify the location and character of the transitions .",
    "most of our data are taken at fixed @xmath0 , varying the fraction @xmath8 of the ` minority ' species and temperature @xmath2 . at high @xmath8",
    ", we observe a continuous transition from a disordered phase into the transverse strip , as the temperature is lowered . noting a significant system - size dependence of the critical line",
    ", we invoke a mean - field scaling argument @xcite which suggests that @xmath156 is a good scaling variable .",
    "this is confirmed quite satisfactorily by our data . at smaller @xmath8 ( @xmath178 for a @xmath71 system )",
    "we observe two transition as @xmath2 is lowered : first into the transverse strip ( continuous ) , and then into the parallel strip ( first order ) . and finally at the smallest @xmath8 a single , continuous transition is observed into the parallel strip .",
    "the junction of the three phases  disorder , transverse and parallel strip  appears to be a multicritical point . analyzing data for a range of system sizes suggests that its location scales with @xmath179 , rather than @xmath8 ; i.e. , the relevant quantity is the number of _ rows _ which can be formed by the minority particles .",
    "depending on how the thermodynamic limit is approached , the multicritical point can shift to @xmath69 .",
    "several projects suggest themselves to extend this work .",
    "first , an analysis of larger systems at fixed @xmath2 could clear up some questions , especially regarding the fate of the ` phase competition ' which is observed close to the multicritical point .",
    "many of the ` transitions ' in the @xmath71 system require an analysis of larger lattices in order to confirm their existence .",
    "second , a look at structure factors in the disordered phase is likely to reveal the presence of long - range correlations .",
    "since these are known to be quite distinct in the kls @xcite and shz @xcite models , it would be interesting to investigate how the crossover occurs .",
    "such a study would also yield considerable insight into the type of noise terms which would have to be added to the mean - field equations in order to capture fluctuations and critical properties accurately .",
    "these equations would then provide a reliable starting point for an analysis of the kls transition in the presence of a few minority charges , in order to understand the true nature of the kls critical point : does it mark the beginning of a critical line , or is it a multicritical point ?",
