    "the x - ray pulsar gx  1 + 4 is unusual in several respects .",
    "it is the only confirmed neutron star in a symbiotic binary @xcite which appears to be accreting from the giant companions stellar wind .",
    "the neutron star spin period evolution exhibits long periods of almost constant spin - up or -down , punctuated by ` torque reversals ' lasting tens of days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indirect estimates indicate a surface magnetic field strength of 23@xmath5  g @xcite .",
    "these values are significantly greater than the @xmath6  g inferred for other accreting x - ray pulsars , generally from measurements of cyclotron scattering resonance features ( csrfs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the x - ray spectra .",
    "as the presence of such a strong field in gx  1 + 4 awaits confirmation by such methods , the possibility that the field strength may in fact be one or more orders of magnitude lower remains .",
    "historically x - ray pulsar spectra have generally been fitted with variations on a power law , which is well known to be a signature of unsaturated comptonization ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "model fitting to the available archival _",
    "data show that the spectra of gx  1 + 4 are broadly consistent with an analytic approximation to a comptonization continuum component combined with a gaussian to represent iron line emission , both attenuated by neutral absorbtion with variable column density @xcite .",
    "the archival _ rxte _ data , which span two orders of magnitude in flux for the source , has also revealed that the x - ray lightcurves and mean pulse profiles of all but one of the observations exhibit sharp dips spanning @xmath70.2 in phase . during 1996",
    "july the countrate dropped to @xmath8  @xmath9  over @xmath10  h ; sharp dips were observed in the mean pulse profiles even then @xcite .",
    "similar dips are observed in only two other x - ray pulsars , rx  j0812.4 - 3114 @xcite and a  0535 + 262 @xcite .",
    "a recent analytic and modelling study suggests that the sharp dips are signatures of eclipses of the emitting region by the accretion column ( galloway et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "pulse - phase spectroscopy using a continuum spectral model simulating thermal comptonization of both gx  1 + 4 and rx  j0812.4@xmath113114 shows a significant increase in the fitted optical depth @xmath4 coincident with the dip phase .",
    "if the inclination angle @xmath12 of these systems are roughly equal to their magnetic colatitude @xmath13 , such an increase may result when one of the accretion columns approaches alignment with the line of sight once each rotation period . at the phase of closest alignment , photons emitted from the polar cap must propagate a greater distance through the column to escape and ultimately reach the observer .",
    "numerical modeling using a simplified column geometry confirms that the resulting increase in optical depth will have just the effect observed in gx  1 + 4 and rx  j0812.4@xmath113114 @xcite .",
    "_ rxte _ consists of three instruments , the proportional counter array ( pca ) sensitive to photons in the energy range 260  kev , the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) covering 16250  kev , and the all - sky monitor ( asm ) which spans 210  kev @xcite .",

    "were clearly observed in the background subtracted pca countrate .",
    "the pulse fraction is defined as @xmath20 and where @xmath21 is the mean pulse profile calculated over @xmath22 bins . on may 16 and 1820 @xmath23 , as is typical for the source . on 17 may however , the sharp dips in the pulse profile were weaker or absent , resulting in a pulse fraction @xmath0 ( figure [ p20170-y ] , second panel from top ) .",
    "the minima are instead broad and irregular , lacking the consistency over successive cyles observed on other days .",

    "* ) following @xcite .",

    "several of the spectral fit parameters show significant variability ( table [ tab - p20170 ] ) .",
    "the column density @xmath24 varied between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the source spectrum temperature @xmath27 was somewhat higher than is typical on 16 may but decreased to a more typical 1.21.3  kev by 18 may . for two of the spectra",
    "the scattering plasma temperature @xmath28 similarly could not be constrained by the fitting algorithm , and instead was fixed at 10  kev . for the other three days @xmath28 varied between @xmath297 and @xmath8  kev .",
    "the most dramatic variation was in the fitted optical depth @xmath4 , which was 3.64 on may 16 and 1820 but @xmath30 on may 17 .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe gaussian component was also unusually high for this spectrum , at more than 1.8  kev .",
    "these variations occurred as the luminosity varied between 1.5@xmath31 , assuming a source distance of 10  kpc .",
    "the actual distance of the source is thought to be in the range 315  kpc @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 values indicate good fits for each spectrum except on may 17 .",
    "the spectrum obtained on this day does not resemble any of the other @xmath33 spectra extracted over the course of the _ rxte _ observations between 1996 and 1997 .",
    "the model fit was problematic in several respects .",
    "initial fits with all parameters free to vary resulted in a fit value for the @xmath34 parameter ( associated with the xe absorption edge at 4.83  kev ) an order of magnitude greater than the maximum for all the other spectra .",
    "thus the value for this parameter was instead fixed ( ` frozen ' ) at the fit value for the spectrum extracted over the whole of the 1997 may observation .",
    "the fitted @xmath27 value , when free to vary , also became much larger than was consistent than for the other spectra and so was fixed at 1.3  kev .",
    "this value is typical for the source at other times @xcite .",
    "while the resulting fit statistic @xmath35 indicates an unacceptable fit , no improvement was found using alternative continuum models , including power law , power law with exponential cutoff and broken powerlaw .",
    "a comparable fit was obtained with a blackbody component resulting in @xmath36 with fitted @xmath37  kev in rough agreement with @xmath38 for the comptt fit of @xmath39  kev .",
    "the data from each of the observations on may 1620 were divided into 10 phase bins based on the pulse period @xmath40  s estimated from regular batse monitoring of the source .",
    "the ephemeris for each day was chosen arbitrarily so that the first phase bin was centered on the primary minimum , defined as phase 0.0 .",
    "each of the resulting phase - selected spectra were fitted with the usual spectral model with at most @xmath28 , @xmath4 and the comptt and gaussian component normalisations free to vary .",
    "the other parameters were fixed at the fit values for the phase - averaged spectrum on the same day .",
    "this approach is essentially identical to that of @xcite . for the may 16 and 19 observations @xmath28",
    "was also fixed at the same value as for the phase - averaged spectrum ( see table [ tab - p20170 ] ) .",
    "variation of @xmath28 and @xmath4 with phase is small except close to the primary minimum .",
    "the fitted @xmath4 around phase 0.0 on may 16 and 1820 was significantly greater than the value for the phase - averaged spectrum , by 2060  per  cent .",
    "for the may 17 observation , at the much shallower primary minimum @xmath4 is instead marginally lower than the phase - averaged fit values , while @xmath28 is somewhat higher ( figure [ pps - y2 ] ) .",
    "for sources with @xmath41 , assuming that @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the footpoints of the accretion column on the neutron star do not change , dips due to column eclipses must always be observed while accretion continues through the columns .",
    "the apparent disappearance of the dip during the 1997 may 17 observations clearly challenges this picture . the flux at this time is more than an order of magnitude larger than the lowest level measured by _",
    "complete cessation of accretion seems unlikely .",
    "another possibility is that the geometry of the system is changing such that the accretion column drops out of alignment briefly .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath12 may vary due to geodetic precession of the pulsar , as is suggested for some radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the magnetic colatitude @xmath13 may change due to evolution of the neutron star magnetic field .",
    "variations due to the former effect , however , are only expected on timescales of years . and",
    "while the latter possibility can not be discounted due to the lack of knowledge regarding such evolution , it seems much more likely that each of these mechanisms would cause a much longer - lasting , if not permanent , cessation of eclipses rather than what is observed in gx  1 + 4 .",
    "variations in the position of the column itself are much more plausible . as the accretion rate @xmath42 ( and hence the luminosity @xmath43 ) decreases , the balance of magnetic and gas pressures at the inner edge of the accretion disc means that the disk will be truncated further out from the neutron star @xcite .",
    "field lines threading the boundary region where disk material decelerates and becomes bound to the accretion column will thus meet the neutron star at progressively higher latitudes on the star . in principle",
    "at least this mechanism may cause the column to move in and out of alignment , in which case eclipses ( and dips ) would be expected only over a finite range of @xmath43 .",
    "instead what appears to be the case for gx  1 + 4 is that dips are normally observed at the full range of luminosities at which the source was observed by _",
    "rxte _ , and are perhaps absent at a particular flux level only within that range .",
    "observations at flux levels comparable to that of 1997 may 17 however do generally exhibit sharp dips .",
    "if the accretion column has indeed been disrupted rather than moved , accretion must be occurring over a much larger region of the neutron stars magnetosphere to give the observed x - ray flux . that material can enter the magnetosphere of the star without being channeled along the field lines suggests either that the magnetic field strength is in actual fact low for an x - ray pulsar , or that some global magnetohydrodynamic instability is operating which can completely disrupt the flow .",
    "the unique phase - averaged _ rxte _ spectrum observed coincident with the unusually low pulse fraction underlines the significance of this event . that the optical depth has increased fivefold compared to values obtained before and after suggests that the source has been ` smothered ' by hot accreting material , which presumably also contributes to the unusually strong fe line emission .",
    "such a large @xmath4 suggests that the photon spectrum will approach thermalization with the scattering material ; the close agreement of the fitted blackbody temperature and the scattering plasma temperature provides corroboration for the comptt component fits during this interval .",
    "the pulse - phase spectral variation was also different to that normally observed in the source . typically @xmath4 is significantly greater than the mean value around the primary minimum ; this is the case for previously published results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the observations on may 16 and 1820 .",
    "on may 17 @xmath4 was instead somewhat _",
    "less _ than the phase - averaged value around the primary minimum .",
    "these results are strongly suggestive of a substantially different distribution of matter around the source .",
    "the increase in the equivalent width also observed on may 17 was not accompanied by the usual increase in the neutral column density @xmath24 @xcite , further indicating varying conditions close to the star rather than in the outer circumstellar matter .",
    "at least one similar event has been observed previously from this source . on 1993",
    "december 11 a pulse fraction @xmath44  per cent ( 20100  kev ) was measured using balloon - borne instruments , along with an unusually hard spectrum with power law energy index @xmath45 @xcite . for comparison",
    ", a power law fit was made to _",
    "spectra from 17 may in the energy band 2040  kev only .",
    "the resulting photon index @xmath46 is consistent with the fit value for the full pca energy range , and represents a significantly harder spectrum than on 1993 december 11 .",
    "flux measurements by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ satellite indicate that following that observation the source entered a hard x - ray low state with @xmath47 ( 2060  kev ) which persisted ( with brief interruptions ) for the next @xmath48  d. in contrast , the may 17 observation was made during a flare lasting @xmath49  d where the flux peaked at @xmath50 .",
    "the other spectra from 1997 may give fitted @xmath4 values at intermediate levels between the two distinct spectral states suggested by analysis of the archival _ rxte _ observations @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the disruption of the accretion column is also related to transitions between distinct spectral and luminosity states inferred from analysis of the full set of _ rxte _ archival data @xcite .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center , and also the batse pulsar group home page at http://www.batse.msfc.masa.gov .",
