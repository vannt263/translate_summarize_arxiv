    "the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 at @xmath0 has been the centre of much interest since a broad iron line was discovered in its x - ray spectrum with the _ asca _ satellite ( tanaka et al 1995 ) .",
    "iron line emission is part of the reflection spectrum produced by the hard x - ray power - law continuum in the source irradiating the accretion disc ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; ross & fabian 1993 ) and is broadened and skewed by doppler , gravitational redshift effects , and light aberration and bending ( fabian et al 1989 ) .",
    "the low energy extent of the line can reveal the inner radius of the accretion disc and thus the black hole spin ( for reviews see fabian et al 2000 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 and fabian & miniutti 2006 ) .",
    "the iron abundance in mcg6 - 30 - 15 appears to be about 23 times the solar value ( fabian et al 2002 ) , making the iron line particularly strong .",
    "mcg6 - 30 - 15 was observed several more times with _ asca _",
    "( iwasawa et al 1996 , 1999 ; matsumoto et al 2003 ; shih et al 2002 ) , by _ bepposax _ ( guainazzi et al 1999 ) , _ rxte _ ( lee et al 1999 ; vaughan & edelson 2001 ) and by _ xmm",
    " newton _ ( wilms et al 2001 ; fabian et al 2002 , 2003 ; vaughan & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "all of these observations confirmed the presence and general broad shape of the iron line .",
    "evidence that the black hole in mcg6 - 30 - 15 is rapidly spinning has been obtained from the extreme breadth of the line by iwasawa et al ( 1996 ) , dabrowski et al ( 1997 ) , wilms et al ( 2001 ) , fabian et al ( 2002 ) and most recently reynolds et al ( 2005 ) , who determine a spin parameter @xmath1 .    the _ xmm  newton _",
    "work emphasizes that much of the emission arise from smaller radii , between @xmath2  @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) .",
    "this may help to explain the otherwise puzzling spectral variations shown by the source .",
    "shih et al ( 2002 ) , fabian et al ( 2002 ) , fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) and taylor , uttley & mchardy ( 2003 ) found that the spectral variability can be explained by a simple two component model consisting of a highly variable power - law continuum ( of almost fixed spectral slope ) and a much less variable reflection spectrum , which of course includes the iron line .",
    "the reflection ( and iron line ) strength do not follow the power - law continuum intensity , as expected in a simple reflection picture .",
    "the small radius of much of the emission can however explain this behaviour when it is recalled that as well as strong gravitational red - shifting occurring in this region , there is also strong gravitational light bending .",
    "this can disconnect variations in the continuum from those of the reflection and has led to the development of the light - bending model ( fabian & vaughan 2003 ; miniutti et al 2003 , 2004 ) , which is a generalization of earlier work on the strong field regime ( martocchia & matt 1996 ; reynolds & begelman 1997 ) .",
    "if the source of the continuum emission ( assumed to be an isotropic emitter ) changes location close to the black hole , then , even if the continuum has a constant intrinsic luminosity , it appears to the outside observer to change in brightness .",
    "this is just due to gravity bending the light rays out of the line of sight by different amounts depending upon the precise location of the source .",
    "much of the radiation is bent down onto the disc , so the observed reflection intensity changes little . the two  component variability pattern and",
    "its light bending interpretation have recently found application in many other accreting black hole sources ( fabian et al 2004 , 2005 ; miniutti , fabian & miller 2004 ; ponti et al 2006 ) .    one striking feature of the model reflection spectrum is a large reflection hump peaking at 2040  kev .",
    "this is where the disc albedo is highest ; at lower energies the albedo is reduced by photoelectric absorption and at higher energies it is reduced ( at a given energy ) by compton down - scattering of the photons ( see e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the presence of the compton hump has been confirmed in the spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 by _ bepposax _ and rxte observations ( guainazzi et al 1999 ; lee et al 2000 ; fabian et al 2002 ) .",
    "what those observations have not done is to determine the variability of the compton hump and show that it varies in the same way as the rest of the reflection spectrum .",
    "here we carry out this important step with the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) on _",
    "suzaku_.    we concentrate on the _ suzaku _ data above 3  kev since there is a complex warm absorber in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( otani et al 1996 ; lee et al 2001 ; turner et al 2003,2004 ) .",
    "the difference spectrum between low and high states of the source shows that absorption is minimal above 3  kev ( fabian et al 2002 ; turner et al 2004 ) and high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) spectra from _ chandra _ show no absorption feature around 6.5  kev which would indicate absorption by species of intermediate ionization which could affect our fits ( young et al 2005 ) .",
    "mcg6 - 30 - 15 was observed four times by _ suzaku _ ( mitsuda et al 2006 ) , once between august 1719 in 2005 for about 45  ks and three times in january 2006 with longer exposures .",
    "here we focus on the three 2006 observations performed between 914 ( 150  ks ) , 2326 ( 99  ks)and 2730 ( 97  ks ) january 2006 .",
    "we use event files from revision 0.7 of the _ suzaku _ pipeline .",
    "version 0.7 processing is an internal processing applied to the _ suzaku _ data obtained during the suzaku working group phase , for the purpose of establishing the detector calibration as quickly as possible .",
    "some processes that are not critical for most of the initial calibration and scientific studies , e.g. , aspect correction , fine tuning of the event time tagging of the xis data , are skipped in version 0 processing , making the quality of the products limited in these directions compared with the official data supplied to guest observers .",
    "the xis data were screened with xselect as standard ( see e.g. koyama et al 2006 ) . the xis products were extracted from circular regions of 4.3 radius centred on the source , while background products were extracted from two smaller circular regions offset from the source ( and avoiding the chip corners with calibration sources ) with a total area equal to that of the source region . the latest response and ancillary response files provided by the instrument teams were used . for the hxd / pin ( takahashi et al 2006 ) , instrumental background spectra were extracted from time dependent models provided by the hxd instrument team , based upon a database of non x - ray background observations made by the pin diode to date . since the background modeling is the key issue for the hard x - ray measurement with the hxd , the hxd team has provided two independent background models , model a and b , which use different algorithms ( kokubun et al .",
    "spectral analysis of the source spectrum using the two models was found to give statistically indistinguishable results for the three 2006 january mcg6 - 30 - 15 observations over the whole 1445  kev band used here , and we use the background model a in our analysis . the response files appropriate for the xis nominal position observation were chosen dated as of 2006/08/07 .    we have extracted products for the three front  illuminated ccd xis detectors ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) and for the back  illuminated ccd ( xis1 ) .",
    "the xis2 and xis3 detectors are found to produce remarkably similar spectra in the whole band used here .",
    "the xis0 spectrum is slightly flatter than that from the xis2 and xis3 detectors so we proceed by co  adding just the xis2 and xis3 products in our analysis ( see yaqoob et al 2006 for mention of structures in the xis0 and xis1 spectra ) . in fig .",
    "[ totallc ] , we show the broad - band 0.512  kev background subtracted light curve from the xis2 and xis3 detectors during the three pointed observations in 2006",
    ". we also show , as a reference , the count rate levels selected to define the high flux ( hf ) and low flux ( lf ) states which will be used to study the spectral variability of mcg6 - 30 - 15 . as normal for this source ( thought to harbour a black hole with a mass of @xmath5 , mchardy et al 2005 ) the light curve exhibits large amplitude and relatively short timescale variability with variations up to factors 23 in a few ks .",
    "we start our analysis of the _ suzaku _ data by considering the 312  kev time  averaged co  added spectrum from the xis2 and xis3 front  illuminated ccd detectors .",
    "( xis response and ancillary files 20060213.rmf and 20060415.arf , with a 6  mm extract radius , were used . )",
    "the most important feature in this energy band is the strong , skewed , relativistic fe k@xmath6 line which characterizes the x  ray spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 enabling us to explore the nature and geometry of the accretion flow close to the central black hole with much higher accuracy than in any other object so far . in fig .",
    "[ feprofiles ] we show the ratio of the data to a simple power law model fitted in the 34  kev and 7.512  kev band and absorbed by the galactic column density ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the residuals clearly show the asymmetric and broad fe k@xmath6 line profile ( top panel ) . in the bottom panel , we superimpose the fe k@xmath6 profile as observed with the _ xmm  newton _ epic  pn camera in 2001 .",
    "the agreement between the two instruments is remarkable and demonstrates the excellent level of the _ suzaku _ xis calibration even in the early stages of the mission .",
    "the 210  kev flux is @xmath9  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath10 in the _ xmm  newton _ observation and @xmath11  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath10 in the _ suzaku _ one .",
    "notice the absorption / emission structures in the blue wing of the relativistic line which are clearly detected by both the epic  pn and the xis detectors with excellent agreement .",
    "as a first attempt to fit the fe k@xmath6 line profile we consider the simplest possible spectral model comprising a power law continuum absorbed by a column of neutral matter ( fixed at the galactic value @xmath12  @xmath8 ) and a set of gaussian emission lines .",
    "we consider first three gaussian emission lines : a narrow unresolved @xmath136.4  kev emission line ( the narrow component of the fe line from distant matter ) , two narrow unresolved @xmath136.7  kev and @xmath136.97  kev absorption lines ( the fexxv and fexxvi resonant absorption line already detected by _",
    "chandra _ , young et al .",
    "2005 ) , and an additional gaussian emission line with width free to vary ( representing the broad relativistic fe line ) .",
    "we obtain a fit with @xmath14 for 2235 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the narrow component of the fe line is at @xmath15 ( uncertainties are quoted throughout the paper at the 90 per cent confidence level ) and has an equivalent width ( ew ) of only @xmath16  ev .",
    "absorption lines are detected at @xmath17  kev and @xmath18  kev .",
    "the broad fe line is at @xmath19 , has a width of @xmath20  ev and an ew of @xmath21  ev .",
    "however , the best  fitting model leaves clear residuals in the 312  kev band .",
    "in particular the broad fe line is not properly modelled and the residuals suggest the introduction of a double gaussian model with one broad gaussian around 6.4  kev and an even broader one at lower energies to model the extended red wing .",
    "we obtain a significant improvement of the statistics with @xmath22 for 2232 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the energies of the three unresolved lines are @xmath23  kev for the narrow fe emission line , and @xmath18  kev , and @xmath24  kev for the absorption lines .",
    "their equivalent widths are @xmath25  ev , @xmath26 , and @xmath27  ev respectively .",
    "the upper limit on the ew of the narrow fe k@xmath6 emission line ( only 30  ev ) indicates that reflection from distant matter plays a minor and marginal role in mcg6 - 30 - 16 , as already demonstrated by high  resolution spectroscopy with the hetg _ chandra _ gratings ( lee et al 2002 ; young et al 2005 ) .",
    "the two absorption line energies are slightly higher than the rest  frame energies of fexxv and fexxvi resonant absorption and are consistent with an origin in a common outflow with velocity of few thousand km  s@xmath10 . in particular , they are both consistent in equivalent width and outflow velocity with the values measured with _ chandra _ ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath10 , young et al 2005 ) .",
    "the photoelectric absorption implied by such a thin highly ionized absorber is small and has a negligible effect on the fits described here .    as for the broad fe line ,",
    "the parameters of the two broad gaussian lines describing its profile are reported in table  1 ( first model `` double gaussian '' ) .",
    "they are both clearly resolved and their cumulative ew is @xmath29  ev , although this value should be taken with care since the continuum is a simple absorbed power law and does not include the reflection continuum which must be associated with the broad fe line .",
    "it is interesting to note that the width of the fe line core at @xmath30  kev is @xmath31  ev ( i.e. fwhm@xmath32  km  s@xmath10 ) suggesting that it originates in the outer disc at @xmath33 from the central black hole , while the red wing has a width @xmath34  ev indicating that the emitting matter is located within @xmath35 from the centre , already implying , even by means of a very simple and phenomenological model , that the black hole in mcg6 - 30 - 15 is most likely a spinning kerr black hole in which the accretion disc extends down within the marginal stable orbit for a non  rotating schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the multiple gaussian fit described above is merely a phenomenological description of the hard spectrum .",
    "the gaussian emission lines and , most importantly , the broad fe line are the clear signature of x - ray reflection and the above spectral model did not include any reflection continuum . here",
    "we build a much more self  consistent model in which the broad fe line is computed together with the associated reflection continuum .",
    "we use a grid of models from ross & fabian ( 2005 ) to obtain the x ",
    "ray reflection spectrum .",
    "the x  ray reflection model has the spectral slope of the illuminating power law @xmath37 , the ionization parameter @xmath38 , the fe abundance , and the normalization as free parameters .",
    "however , we forced the photon index to be the same as the power law continuum for consistency .",
    "since the reflection model does not include ni as an element , we also include a ni k@xmath6 line with energy fixed at 7.47  kev .    in order to reproduce the relativistic broad fe line profile ,",
    "the reflection spectrum is convolved with a relativistic kernel derived from the laor ( 1991 ) code .",
    "the relativistic blurring parameters are the emissivity indexes @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( where the emissivity is @xmath41 within the innermost @xmath36 and @xmath42 outside ) , the inner disc radius @xmath43 , and the observer inclination @xmath44 . the outer disc radius is fixed at its maximum allowed value of @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of a broken power law emissivity profile is motivated by the previous long _ xmm  newton _ observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( vaughan & fabian 2004 ) .",

    "the results of the spectral fitting are reported in table  [ tab1 ] ( `` blurred reflection '' model ) .",
    "we obtain a better fit with @xmath69 for 2230 dof .",
    "the better fit with respect to the phenomenological double gaussian model described above is due to a better description of the overall relativistic fe line profile .",
    "in addition , the model accounts for some high  energy residuals above about 10  kev which were present in the above best  fitting solution due to the unmodelled reflection component .",
    "we measure a relatively standard @xmath70 continuum slope which compares very well with previous results with _ xmm ",
    "newton_. the reflection component contributes significantly to the hard spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 and we measure a reflection fraction of @xmath71 ( @xmath72 corresponds to the level of reflection expected from @xmath73  sr ) , fully consistent with previous results from a simultaneous _ xmm ",
    "newton _ and _ bepposax _ observation ( vaughan & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the precise value of the reflection fraction will be better constrained in a subsequent analysis when the high energy data from the hxd / pin detector are considered as well .",
    "the reflector is only mildly ionized with @xmath74  erg  cm  s@xmath10 and the inclination is constrained to be @xmath75 .    as for the relevant relativistic blurring parameters , the xis data are able to constrain the inner disc radius to be smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "if , as it is customary , @xmath43 is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit around a kerr black hole , such a small 90 per cent upper limit implies that the black hole spin in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is @xmath77 , i.e. the black hole is an almost maximally spinning kerr black hole .",
    "the inner and outer emissivity profiles are not consistent with each other within the errors and @xmath78 is steeper than @xmath79 .",
    "however , if the two indices are forced to be one and the same , we obtain @xmath80 with only a slight worsening of the fit statistic ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "in the above analysis the relativistic fe line is associated with its own reflection continuum and a self  consistent model to the 312  kev spectrum is found . however , one of the main characteristics of the _ suzaku _ mission is the presence of the hxd pin hard x - ray detector providing high quality data above 12  kev ( fig .",
    "[ pinspectra ] ) .",
    "the spectral analysis of the xis data revealed the presence of a strong reflection component associated with the broad relativistic fe line which would produce a strong compton hump around 2030  kev .",
    "the hxd data above 12  kev are thus crucial to investigate the reflection component further and will enable us to infer the reflection parameters and to measure the direct and reflection continua with high accuracy .    in fig .",
    "[ xisandpinplfit ] , we show the xis and hxd / pin time  averaged spectrum in the 0.545  kev band .",
    "the figure shows the data to model ratio for a power law model fitted above 3  kev and ignoring the bands where reflection is expected to dominate .",
    "the ratio clearly shows the presence of both the relativistic fe line in the xis data and also the presence of a large compton hump around 20  kev visually confirming that the hard spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 is dominated by a strong reflection component .",
    "absorption is present affecting the soft band below 3  kev .",
    "we avoid the complication of modelling the complex warm absorber and we concentrate , in this first paper on the _ suzaku _ observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , on the data above 3  kev .",
    "a detailed model of the warm absorber will be presented elsewhere where the data from the back  illuminated ( more sensitive at soft energies ) xis detector will be also considered .",
    "we consider our best  fitting spectral model to the 312  kev xis data and extend it to the pin data between 14  kev and 45  kev .",
    "we include a cross - normalization constant between the xis and pin data and find that it is constrained to be @xmath82 ( where the xis constant is set to @xmath83 ) .",
    "this factor is consistent with the results obtained from crab observations ( kokubun et al .",
    "2006 ) . since the available hxd / pin background model a",
    "does not include the contribution from the x  ray cosmic background , a spectral model of the form @xmath84 was included in all spectral fits in the hxd / pin band ( the model being valid up to about 70  kev ) .",
    "the model is based on the _ heao_a1 spectrum , re  scaled to account for the hxd field of view .    the best ",
    "fitting xis model provides an acceptable description of the 345  kev data and we obtain a good quality fit of @xmath85 for 2312 dof .",
    "the model parameters are very much consistent with those obtained from the 312  kev parameters .",
    "in fact , extending the model up to 45  kev provides a reasonable description of the hard data , reproducing most of the large compton hump seen in fig .",
    "[ xisandpinplfit ] , even before fitting .",
    "the results for the time  averaged ( ta ) spectrum in the 345  kev band are reported in table  2 together with similar fits to the high flux ( hf ) and low flux ( lf ) spectra which will be discussed below .",
    "the reflection component contributes significantly to the total flux and we measure a large reflection fraction of @xmath86 . as a reference , and",
    "since it will be useful in a spectral variability analysis below , we report here that its contribution represents the @xmath87 per cent of the total flux in the 312  kev band and the @xmath88 per cent in the 1445  kev band .",
    "the relativistic blurring parameters are consistent within the errors with those already reported in table  [ tab1 ] and the same is true for the continuum power law slope and for the ionization parameter .    as a consistency check ,",
    "we have also determined the level of the reflection component by using the spectrum above 7.5  kev , so avoiding the iron line . for this the pexrav model in xspec was used , with results @xmath89 , reflection fraction @xmath90 and iron abundance poorly constrained ( @xmath91 times solar ) .",
    "we note that such reflection predicts a _ strong _ iron line with an equivalent width of at least 300  ev ( taking conservatively an iron abundance of unity and reflection fraction of 2 ) , using the predictions of george & fabian ( 1991 ) .",
    "the limit on any narrow component to the iron emission feature is at least ten times smaller than this ( this work ; lee et al 2002 ; young et al 2005 ) , thereby ruling out any non - smeared origin for the reflection component .",
    "the reflection must be due to matter well within the optical broad line region .",
    "we also stress that if the evidence for relativistic reflection is taken into account and the pexrav component is blurred accordingly , the shape of the reflection continuum is broader and redshifted requiring a higher fe abundance ( @xmath92 times solar ) and reflection fraction ( @xmath93 ) to fit the data , while the continuum photon index is basically unaffected .",
    "the blurred and fe overabundant reflector described by pexrav is thus fully consistent with our best  fitting results with a much more complex spectral model including the relativistic fe line ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the hxd / pin detector has no imaging capabilities and thus there is no simple way to obtain a background subtracted light curve by selecting appropriate regions .",
    "however , background subtracted light curves can be obtained by extracting spectra in each time interval , subtracting the background from the available models in the same time interval , and reading out the background subtracted count rate . in background model",
    "a , the background of the hxd is calculated from the data base by using the count rate of the upper discriminator , which has a strong correlation with the flux of the non - x - ray background .",
    "the procedure must also include a model for the cosmic x  ray background ( not included in the available background models ) and we use the same model as for spectral fitting by simulating the cosmic x  ray background hxd / pin spectrum and adding it to the instrumental background .",
    "we have applied the above procedure to the hxd / pin data by selecting , after some experimentation , a timescale of 45  ks enabling us to obtain about 5000 background subtracted counts per time interval in the 1445  kev pin band on average . in fig .",
    "[ 45kslc ] we show the xis2 and xis3 and the hxd / pin light curves for the three 2006 observations in the 0.512  kev and 1445  kev respectively . to ease the comparison , the xis light curves have been re  scaled so that they have the same mean count rate as the pin ones in each segment ( i.e. observation ) .",
    "it is visually clear that the harder band ( solid red ) has a much lower variability amplitude than the softer one ( dotted black ) . in the following we",
    "explore a set of different techniques with the aim of exploring the flux and spectral variability of the source .      as a first model  independent way to characterize the flux / spectral variability of mcg6 - 30 - 15 we analysed the relationship of the fluxes ( count rates ) in different energy bands following the technique of flux ",
    "flux plots introduced by churazov , gilfanov & revnivtsev ( 2001 ) in a study of cygnus x1 spectral variability , and taylor , uttley & mchardy ( 2003 ) as a model  independent tool to disentangle the main drivers of the spectral variability in agn .    in fig .",
    "[ ff ] we show the 3 - 12  kev xis count rate from the 45  ks light curve against the count rate in the 12  kev band which is chosen as reference ( see also vaughan & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the relationship between the count rates in the two bands is remarkably linear and leaves a clear hard offset on the y  axis , as already noticed by taylor , uttley & mchardy ( 2003 ) and vaughan & fabian ( 2004 ) in previous _",
    "rxte _ and _ xmm  newton _ observations .",
    "the linearity of the relationship indicates that the flux variations are strongly dominated by changes in the normalization of a spectral component with constant spectral shape . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard offset suggests the presence of a component that varies little and that contributes more to the hard than to the reference 12  kev band .",
    "we measure a hard offset of @xmath94  cts / s which can be used to infer the contribution of the weakly variable component at mean flux level : since the mean count rate in the 312  kev band is @xmath95  cts / s , the hard offset @xmath96 represents @xmath97 per cent of the 312  kev flux at mean flux level .",
    "this compares very well with the @xmath87 per cent contribution of the reflection component to the 312  kev band , as obtained from direct spectral fitting .",
    "we have applied the same technique to the hxd / pin light curve and plotted the 1445  kev count rate against the 12  kev reference one .",
    "the relationship is much more noisy than when data from the xis alone were used . to reduce the scatter and decrease the pin error bars , we have binned the original flux  flux plot according to the soft reference count rate so that each new point comprises three original data points . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ ff ] we show the binned flux  flux plot obtained by plotting the 1445  kev hxd / pin count rate against the reference 12  kev one .",
    "a fit with a linear relationship is perfectly acceptable ( @xmath98 for 5 dof ) , again indicating the presence of a clear hard offset in the pin band . in this case , the contribution of the weakly variable ( reflection ) component to the 1445  kev band at mean flux level is estimated to be as high as @xmath99 per cent .",
    "again , this is in good agreement with the contribution of the reflection component in the 1445  kev band obtained from direct spectral fitting ( @xmath88 per cent ) .    the flux ",
    "flux plot analysis detailed above indicates that the spectral variability of mcg6 - 30 - 15 can be decomposed into two main components : a highly variable component which varies in normalization only but not in spectral shape , and a weakly variable one which has a much harder spectral shape .",
    "the excellent agreement between the contribution of the weakly variable component in the different energy bands as inferred from the flux  flux plot analysis and that of the reflection component as obtained by direct spectral fitting strongly suggest that the weakly variable component is the relativistically smeared x  ray reflection from the accretion disc .",
    "obviously , the highly variable component can be identified with the other component required by spectral fitting , i.e. the power law continuum . the flux ",
    "flux plots suggest that as the source varies , the power law maintains the same spectral slope and only varies in normalization .",
    "a further approach to studying the spectral variability of a source is the rms spectrum , which , for a chosen timescale , is the fractional variability seen at each energy expressed as a flux normalized root mean square variability function .",
    "the rms spectrum allows us to quantify the fractional variability as a function of energy in a model ",
    "independent manner and is therefore an important piece of information , complementary to the flux ",
    "flux plot analysis described above .",
    "such rms spectra have previously been determined for mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( matsumoto et al 2003 ; fabian et al 2002 ; ponti et al 2004 ) . however , as far as data below 10  kev are available , the rms spectrum has proved to be ambiguous to model .",
    "in particular , the typical trend that is observed in agn is that the fractional variability decreases with energy , a behaviour that can be explained either in terms of a power law softening at high flux levels ( i.e. a pivoting power law ) or in the framework of the two  component model discussed above .",
    "the new ingredient here is to include the hxd / pin data above 10  kev with the goal of confirming / rejecting the interpretation that comes out from the flux ",
    "flux plots analysis .",
    "our result for a 45  ks timescale is shown in fig .",
    "the general trend is that the rms decreases with energy with a marked drop at @xmath100  kev reassuringly confirming that the fe line is less variable than the continuum , as already noticed in previous works ( e.g. vaughan & fabian 2004 ; ponti et al 2004 ) .",
    "the novelty of the _ suzaku _ observation is represented by the hxd / pin data .",
    "they confirm the trend of lower fractional variability at higher energies but they lie above and not on the extrapolation of the 26  kev trend .",
    "we have theoretically modelled the rms spectrum by considering our best  fitting spectral model to the time  averaged spectrum and reproducing the 45  ks data by allowing only the power law normalization to vary , i.e. enforcing a perfect two  component model .",
    "the result of this exercise is shown as a solid red line in fig .",
    "[ rms ] and shows that the rms spectrum is fully consistent with a two  component model in which the only variable component is a constant  slope power law .",
    "some variability of the reflection component can not be excluded , but its variability amplitude is certainly not comparable to the variability amplitude of the power law . indeed , small mismatches between the model and the data could be due to some intrinsic variability of the reflection component which deserves more detailed study to be performed in future work .",
    "having analysed the spectral variability of mcg6 - 30 - 15 with two model  independent ( and calibration  independent ) techniques we now consider a more direct approach through spectral fitting .",
    "we extracted high flux ( hf ) and low flux ( lf ) from both the xis and the pin spectra according to the selection criterion shown in fig .",
    "[ totallc ] .",
    "we first consider a simple power law fit in the 345  kev band ignoring , as done before , the fe k and compton hump bands .",
    "the result for the hf and lf spectra is shown in fig .",
    "[ hfandlfra ] as a ratio plot .",
    "there is a clear evidence , both in the xis and in the hxd / pin , that the reflection component contributes more to the lf than to the hf spectrum , which again indicates an almost constant reflection .",
    "we have then applied the same spectral model as for the 345  kev time  averaged ( ta ) spectrum to the hf and lf spectra and our results are reported in table  2 .",
    "almost all parameters are consistent with being the same in the hf and lf spectra .",
    "in particular , the power law slope is consistent with being constant and equal to @xmath101 in the ta , hf , and lf spectra .",
    "the same is true for the fe abundance , disc inclination , inner disc radius , outermost emissivity index @xmath59 and reflector ionization state ( although there is some indication for a lower ionization at low flux levels ) .",
    "the innermost emissivity index @xmath39 appears to be steeper in the lf than in the hf spectrum , but the two indexes are still consistent with each other within the 90 per cent errors .",
    "a steeper emissivity profile in the lf state would produce a more extended red wing as expected in the framework of the light bending model where low flux states are characterized by a more centrally concentrated illumination of the inner disc ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the reflection fraction definitely appears to vary and it is higher in the lf spectrum ( @xmath102 ) than in the hf one ( @xmath103 ) as already strongly suggested by the ratio plot in fig .",
    "[ hfandlfra ] .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the indication inferred from the flux  flux plot and rms spectrum analysis discussed above : if the reflection component is only weakly variable , its contribution increases in the lf states because the direct power law decreases while the reflection stays approximately constant .",
    "we point out that this is exactly the behaviour predicted by the light bending model ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the spectra , best ",
    "fitting models and residuals for the hf and lf states are shown in fig .  [ hfandlffit ] .",
    "fit spectral components are as in fig .",
    "[ suzakumo ] ( which refers to the best  fit parameters to the time  averaged spectrum ) with the only major difference in the hf / lf state being due to a higher / lower power law normalization .",
    "we also produced a difference spectrum obtained by subtracting the lf spectrum from the hf one for the xis and hxd / pin . by definition ,",
    "the difference spectrum only shows the variable components of the spectrum ( modified by absorption ) , while any non variable component is subtracted away . in fig .",
    "[ diffspec ] we show the residuals to a simple power law fit in the 345  kev band where galactic absorption is included .",
    "the power law fit is very good and the power law slope is consistent with that found in our spectral analysis ( @xmath104 ) but clear positive residuals are left in a broad hump around 6  kev at the @xmath105 level .",
    "this may indicate either that the red wing of the relativistic fe line has varied in flux or that the shape of the line is slightly different in the hf and lf spectra .",
    "if the residuals are due to flux variability of the reflection component , we should also see some positive residuals at the compton hump energy ( 2030  kev ) which are not seen in the hxd / pin difference spectrum .",
    "some reflection variability is in fact allowed by the results of our spectral fits of the hf and lf spectra ( see table  2 ) although the reflection flux is consistent with being the same at the two flux levels . if the reflection flux varied but the fe line keeps the same shape , the main residual in the difference spectrum should be at the energy of the blue peak of the line , around 6.4  kev , while the residuals in fig .",
    "[ diffspec ] indicate that only the red wing of the line has varied .",
    "the remaining possibility is that the fe line has a different shape ( rather than a different flux ) in the hf and lf spectra .",
    "this is already hinted at by the inner emissivity index ( @xmath39 , see table  2 ) which is marginally steeper in the lf state ( although consistent within the errors ) .",
    "if the emissivity is really different at the two flux levels , residuals are produced in the red wing of the line and could potentially explain those seen in the difference spectrum ( and at the same time the lack of residual at compton hump energies ) .",
    "the result is in the sense expected from the light - bending model ( see fig .  4 of miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the suzaku observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 has , for the first time , enabled the hard x - ray variability of the source to be determined .",
    "a wide range of techniques including direct spectral fitting , flux - flux plots and rms spectrum all show that the spectral variability on a 45  ks timescale can be decomposed into just two broad components above 3  kev , namely a variable power - law continuum and a harder constant component .",
    "this last component has the broad iron line and reflection hump expected from x - ray reflection in the very innermost regions of an accretion disc around a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "just the strength and shape of the reflection component predicts a high equivalent width iron line , much stronger than the weak narrow emission component seen in the spectrum .",
    "the only way for such a strong iron line to be ` hidden ' in the spectrum is for it to be smeared into the broad emission structure that we observe .",
    "the behaviour of the power - law and reflection components is consistent with the light bending model .",
    "in which case much of the rapid ( power - law component ) variability seen in the source is due to strong gravitational light bending as the site of the emission region changes location within a few gravitational radii of the black hole .",
    "we assume that the emission region is associated with some magnetic structure produced by the strong differential motions in the accretion disc .",
    "note that to produce observed variability the emission region does not need to physically move , just that the main emission site changes position .",
    "the broad iron line is strong in mcg6 - 30 - 15 because both the iron abundance is high , at around 2 times the solar value , and the large degree of light bending around its kerr black hole has emphasised the reflection spectrum relative to the power - law continuum .",
    "we are deeply grateful to the whole suzaku team for building , launching , calibrating and operating the spacecraft and instruments .",
