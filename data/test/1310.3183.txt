    "the 126 gev particle observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite corresponds to the _ higgs particle h _ of the electroweak @xmath2 extension  @xcite of the original higgs model  @xcite .",
    "the higgs explains masses of all sm particles , with neutrino masses as a possible exception .",
    "the proposed models of neutrino masses involve beyond sm degrees of freedom : new fermion multiplets , extra scalar multiplets or both of them .    in the present attempt to account both for the mechanism of neutrino mass and for the existence of a stable dark matter ( dm ) we put forward a variant of the scotogenic radiative neutrino - mass model by ma  @xcite realized by hypercharge zero triplet scalar field .",
    "a distinguished feature of such radiative neutrino - mass model is that there is no need to introduce additional discrete @xmath0 symmetry to eliminate the competing tree - level contribution .",
    "an earlier study  @xcite of weinberg operator generated at one loop level has been followed by recent classifications of radiative neutrino - mass models which provide dark matter candidates , in which the present model with zero hypercharge scalar triplet is listed as _ type d _ in  @xcite and _ class t3-a _ in  @xcite .    while the proposed neutrino mass model is new , the newly introduced fields have been studied previously in different context .",
    "in particular , the neutral component of the scalar triplet which may be viable dm candidate has already been studied in several accounts  @xcite . here , we have an interplay of this field with additional beyond sm fields , which depends on the variant of the proposed neutrino mass model",
    ". therefore we expose at the end of each section the piece of the phenomenology which is most relevant for a given variant of our model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the new fields and the radiative mass generation mechanism . in section 3",
    "we impose extra discrete @xmath0 symmetry which enables that the neutrino masses are induced by the dm exchange so that the model is scotogenic . in section 4",
    "we study another scotogenic variant of the neutrino mass model where discrete @xmath0 symmetry is replaced by @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "thereby the hypercharge zero scalar triplet becomes complex .",
    "if we break @xmath1 symmetry , the phenomenology of the model will depend on the scale of @xmath1 breaking",
    ". the model may include interesting astrophysical implications  @xcite or may have lhc signatures  @xcite .",
    "in the concluding section we summarize the results of the proposed variants of the model and list the constraints which may be achieved for the model parameters .",
    "the model is based on the electroweak gauge group @xmath2 , where the neutrino mass is generated by charged exotic particles in the loop - diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the new charged particles are a component of the scalar triplet field and another charged singlet scalar and a component of the additional lepton doublet which is vectorlike .",
    "thus , the sm leptons transforming as @xmath3 should be supplemented by three generations of beyond sm vector - like states @xmath4 in the scalar sector , the sm higgs doublet @xmath5 should be supplemented by charged scalar singlet @xmath6 and an additional hypercharge zero triplet which in the matrix notation reads @xmath7 the gauge invariant yukawa interactions and the mass terms involving new fermion fields are given by @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the yukawa - coupling matrices and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass matrices of the new lepton doublet .",
    "the mass term @xmath12 can be rotated away by a field redefinition , and for simplicity we drop the flavor indices altogether .",
    "the gauge invariant scalar potential with extra charged singlet and real triplet field has a form @xmath13 + \\lambda_3 ( \\mathrm{tr}[\\delta^2])^2 + \\lambda_4 h^\\dag h h^-h^+ + \\lambda_5 h^\\dag h \\mathrm{tr}[\\delta^2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ + \\lambda_6 h^-h^+ \\mathrm{tr}[\\delta^2 ] + ( \\lambda_7 h^\\dag\\delta\\tilde{h}h^+ + \\mathrm{h.c . } ) + \\mu h^\\dag \\delta h \\",

    "( [ potential ] ) which induces a vev for the neutral triplet component @xmath16 .",
    "this vev is constrained by electroweak measurements to be smaller than a few gev .        the neutrino mass matrix obtained from an effective operator displayed in fig .",

    "they may be sufficiently light to be produced and studied at the lhc .",
    "since in the present form our model does not provide a viable dm candidate , the charged scalars can be sufficiently light to produce observable effects in the lhc diphoton higgs signal .",
    "on the other hand , the measured @xmath19 signal constrains the couplings of new charged scalar states which affect this loop amplitude .",
    "using the same conventions and notations as in  @xcite , the enhancement factor with respect to the sm decay width reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are charged scalar mass eigenstates and @xmath23 are the couplings from @xmath24 terms , linked to the couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in fig .",

    "recent study  @xcite scrutinizes the lhc diphoton signal in purely hypercharge - zero scalar triplet extension of the sm .",
    "among the fields introduced in our model only the neutral component of the scalar triplet can be a dm candidate .",
    "however , in order to ensure dm stability , we have to assign a protective @xmath0 symmetry to all new fields circulating in the loop diagram . in this way",

    "our unique dm candidate @xmath16 is hypercharge - less dm which does not couple directly to @xmath43 boson .",
    "accordingly , it is not ruled out by direct - detection experiments . however , there are constraints from the relic abundance for dm .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , its correct value can be achieved by annihilations of @xmath16 to gauge bosons with mass of @xmath16 in the multi - tev range , and thus out of the reach of the lhc .",
    "therefore , the other states must be even heavier so that this scotogenic variant of the model leads to purely virtual beyond sm physics at the lhc .",
    "let us introduce a variant of our model based on @xmath44 gauge symmetry , where an extra @xmath1 gauge factor has been introduced to stabilize the dm candidate .",
    "using @xmath1 gauge symmetry avoids the breaking of @xmath0 by quantum gravity , which is a serious problem for any discrete symmetry .",
    "all sm fields are uncharged under the new gauge group and all newly introduced states are singly @xmath1 charged . thereby",
    ", the real triplet field becomes complex and , for a given relic density , the mass of a complex multiplet dm candidate is smaller by a factor @xmath45 compared to the real multiplet case .",
    "also , for complex triplet @xmath46 there are terms additional to those shown in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , @xmath47 as explicated in  @xcite , the quartic coupling @xmath48 generates a mass splitting making a half of the charged fields of the multiplet lighter than the neutral component at tree - level .",
    "this may be compensated by an additional splitting @xmath49 166 mev from one - loop with electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the condition that the neutral component @xmath16 stays the lightest particle within the multiplet is that @xmath50 ) .",
    "more pronounced splitting between the charged and neutral component of the triplet @xmath46 may arise due to a mixing between the charged triplet and the charged singlet scalar in eq .",
    "( [ singlet - triplet ] ) .",
    "there is a portion of the parameter space where the charged @xmath51 is considerably heavier , so that annihilations to force carriers may become important  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we should distinguish the scenario with an exact @xmath1 gauge symmetry from a setup where @xmath1 is broken to @xmath0 by a complex singlet scalar field @xmath52 doubly charged under @xmath1 , in which case there is a massive dark photon @xmath53 as well as a real scalar field @xmath54 .",
    "dark higgs boson @xmath54 will mix with the sm higgs boson @xmath55 in the most general scalar potential , and the dark photon @xmath53 may have kinetic mixing with the sm photon .",
    "two alternative regimes have been explored recently .",
    "very light dark force carriers @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the mev range may explain astrophysical observations such as the dark matter distribution in dwarf galactic halos  @xcite .",
    "in a regime where the @xmath1 is broken near the electroweak scale , there could be additional sm higgs decays to multilepton final states through the dark higgs boson and the dark photon studied in  @xcite . in this case the experiments at the lhc probe for the possible existence of a @xmath1 dark sector governed by the original abelian higgs model  @xcite .",
    "the present neutrino mass model is minimal in a sense that the new fields do not exceed multiplet higher than adjoint .",
    "the hypercharge - less scalar triplet @xmath56 completed with appropriate charged scalar singlet @xmath57 and vectorlike fermion doublet @xmath58 closes the radiative neutrino mass loop diagram which constraints the coupling @xmath17 .    in the variant of the model where the additional scalars are unconstrained in mass",
    "two charged scalar may be revealed through the higgs diphoton signal at the lhc , which on the other hand constraints the couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in @xmath0",

    "accordingly , the rest of the beyond sm states are heavy and stay out of direct reach of the lhc .",
    "the phenomenology becomes richer upon promoting dm - stabilizing discrete @xmath0 symmetry to the gauge symmetry @xmath1 , which may be broken by a vev of the doubly @xmath1-charged scalar field @xmath52 .",
