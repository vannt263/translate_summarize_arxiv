    "state - of - the - art experimental techniques , like scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite and mechanically controllable break junctions ( mcbj),@xcite enable the manipulation of individual atoms and the fabrication of metallic , atomic - sized contacts . from a fundamental scientific point of view",
    "these systems allow us to investigate a variety of phenomena at the ultimate limit of atomic scale and prove basic ideas of quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , when studying conductance , the familiar ohm s law completely breaks down and the fully quantum - mechanical description should be applied to elucidate the phenomenon.@xcite    our understanding of ballistic transport of atomic - sized conductors is usually based on the landauer formula,@xcite @xmath2 where conductance is represented as a sum of transmission probabilities @xmath3 of individual eigenchannels . when the @xmath3 s are known many properties of a system can be predicted such as conductance fluctuations,@xcite the shot noise,@xcite dynamical coulomb blockade@xcite and the supercurrent.@xcite it has been demonstrated in the pioneering work by scheer _",
    "et al._@xcite that a study of the current - voltage characteristics for the superconducting atomic - sized contacts allows to obtain transmission probabilities @xmath3 s for particular atomic configurations realized in the mcbj experiments .",
    "the @xmath3 s can be determined by fitting theoretical and experimental @xmath4 curves and exploiting information contained in the `` subgap structure''.@xcite the breakthrough in the interpretation of experimental results was done by cuevas _",
    "et al._@xcite who suggested a parameterized tight - binding model for the description of atomic constrictions . as a central result",
    "it has been shown that the number of conducting modes ( eigenchannels ) for a single - atomic contact correlates with the number of valence orbitals of the contact atom which therefore determines the current flowing through the system .",
    "this result has been confirmed experimentally by scheer _",
    "et al._@xcite the analysis of the last conductance plateau corresponding to single - atom constrictions has revealed that a number of conducting channels is 1 for au , 3 for al and pb , and 5 for  nb .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to clarify with the help of parameter - free _ ab initio _ calculations the issue on how the valence states of the central atom of a single - atom contact determine conducting channels .",
    "our approach is based on the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method@xcite supplemented with the baranger and stone@xcite formulation of the conductance problem .",
    "instead of considering a variety of different metallic atomic point contacts we restrict our calculations to single @xmath0 or @xmath1 transition metal atoms attached to noble metal ( cu ) or transition metal ( pd ) leads .",
    "systems of this type can be realized experimentally by using alloys to fabricate the point contacts.@xcite according to our preliminary study,@xcite we await the variation of conductance depending on the atomic number of the impurity situated at the central site .",
    "the number of conducting modes is also expected to change with respect to the atomic number of the impurity , especially because of the existence of the virtual bound states .",
    "we would like to mention , that the conductance through different type of constrictions contaminated by impurities has been studied before on the _ ab initio _ level by lang@xcite , hirose and coworkers@xcite and palots and coworkers.@xcite in contrast to previous studies",
    ", we analyze the eigenchannel decomposition of the conductance . within our approach each channel",
    "is classified according to the irreducible representation of the corresponding point group of the system as well as by orbital contributions when the channel wave function is projected on the central atom . that relates the method presented here with the tight - binding model suggested by cuevas _",
    "et al._@xcite and gives a microscopic insight into the conductance .",
    "the structures under study consist of two semi - infinite cu or pd fcc ( 001 ) leads connected by an atomic cluster with a single contact atom in the middle of a junction as it is shown in fig.1 .",
    "we consider the contact atom to be either a host atom or different @xmath0 or @xmath1 transition metal impurities as will be discussed later .",
    "we assume that the geometry of constrictions shown in fig.1 catches limiting configurations of atomic contacts produced in the mcbj experiments . to realize different contact atoms one could use dilute alloys as a wire material in the mcbj,@xcite or probe conductance through a single atom with an stm tip.@xcite since in the experiments",
    "the measurements are not performed for the equilibrium atomic configurations rather than the conductance is recorded dynamically under stretching of nanocontacts,@xcite we did not optimize the interatomic distances and kept them the same as in bulk fcc metals cu and pd with lattice constants 6.83 a.u .  and 7.35 a.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "our calculations are based on density functional theory within the local density approximation .",
    "we employed the non - relativistic version of the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method to calculate the electronic structure of the systems .",
    "since details of the method can be found elsewhere,@xcite only a brief description is given below .",
    "the parametrization of vosko , wilk , and nusair @xcite for the exchange and correlation energy was used .",
    "the potentials were assumed to be spherically symmetric around each atom ( atomic sphere approximation , asa ) .",
    "however , the full charge density , rather than its spherically symmetric part , was taken into account . to achieve well converged results the angular momentum cut - off for the wavefunctions and the green s function",
    "was chosen to be @xmath5 that imposed a natural cut - off @xmath6 for the charge density expansion . in case of the heavy element",
    "pd the scalar relativistic approximation@xcite was used .    in the multiple - scattering kkr approach the one - electron retarded green s function",
    "is given by the site angular momentum expansion @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are restricted to the cells @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 denote one of the two vectors @xmath8 or @xmath9 with the smaller or the larger absolute value , and local functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the regular and irregular solutions of the schrdinger equation for the single potential @xmath16 of the @xmath10-th cell in free space . here the index @xmath17 stands for the angular momentum quantum numbers and atomic units are used : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . the structural green s function @xmath21 ( structure constants ) in eq .",
    "( [ grr ] ) is related to the known structure constants of the appropriately chosen reference system by the algebraic dyson equation which includes the difference @xmath22 between local @xmath23-matrices of the physical and a reference system . in the screened kkr",
    "method@xcite we use a lattice of strongly repulsive , constant muffin - tin potentials ( typically , @xmath24ry height ) as reference system that leads to structure constants which decay exponentially in real space .",
    "when the kkr method is applied to the systems shown in fig.1 both the constriction region and the leads are treated on the same footing .",
    "this is achieved by using the hierarchy of green s functions connected by a dyson equation , so that one performs the self - consistent electronic structure calculations of complicated systems in a step - like manner .",
    "first , using the concept of principal layers together with the decimation technique,@xcite we calculate the structural green s function @xmath25 of the auxiliary system consisting of semi - infinite leads separated by a vacuum barrier ( here @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to layer indexes ) . at the the second step the atomic cluster",
    "is embedded between the leads by solving the dyson equation self - consistently , @xmath28 and the structural green s function @xmath29 of the complete system is obtained .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) is solved in real space since due to effective screening of the perturbation the charge deviations are restricted nearby the constriction .      in what follows",
    ", we will consider only a ballistic coherent regime of the electron transport thus limiting our study to zero temperature , infinitely small bias and singe - particle picture . to evaluate the conductance of nanocontacts we employ the kubo linear response theory as formulated by baranger and stone : @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are retarded and advanced green s functions , respectively .",
    "the current flows in @xmath34 direction , and @xmath35 .",
    "the integration is performed over two ( left and right ) planes @xmath36 and @xmath37 which connect the leads with the scattering region as it is shown in fig .  1 . the implementation of the eq .",
    "( [ cond_g ] ) in the site angular momentum representation of the kkr method and related to it convergence properties were described in detail in ref .  .",
    "within the asa used in this work instead of integration over planes we average conductance over atomic layers and obtain : @xmath38.\\ ] ] here , tr involves site ( @xmath10 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath39 ) indices related to the atomic plane  @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "@xmath40 stands for the matrix notation of the structural green s function introduced in eq .",

    "the integral is performed over the volume @xmath46 of the wigner - seitz cell around site @xmath10 which belongs either to the atomic plane @xmath36 or to the plane @xmath37 , and @xmath47 is the distance separating nearest - neighbor atomic layers in @xmath34 direction .",
    "ballistic conductance of an atomic constriction can be decomposed into individual eigenchannels . according to the landauer formalism , which was proved to be equivalent to the kubo approach,@xcite conductance reads as @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 s are eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath50 which defines the transmission probability for an incident bloch wave from the left electrode to be transmitted to an outgoing bloch wave in the right , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are bloch vectors for incident and transmitted waves , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the corresponding band indices . a procedure for the evaluation of the conductance eigenchannels will be published elsewhere.@xcite to solve the eigenvalue problem for the transmission matrix @xmath55 , the perturbed bloch states of the whole system are projected to the basis of local functions @xmath56 and conductance is represented as a sum of two contributions : @xmath57\\ + \\ g_0\\ , \\mathrm{tr\\,}_{(n , l ) } \\left[{\\cal{t}}^{- } \\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath58 here @xmath59 are two parts of the anti - symmetric hermitian operator @xmath60 defined by eq.([d_lr ] ) .",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 have positive and negative eigenvalues , respectively .",
    "when the atomic plane @xmath36 is placed in the asymptotic region of the left lead far from the atomic constriction the second term in eq.([g_2terms ] ) , involving trace of @xmath63 , is equal to zero and eigenchannels are found as eigenvectors of operator @xmath64 .",
    "however , in practice we are forced to take integration planes closer to the constriction in order to obtain convergent value for the conductance with respect to number of atoms in the cross - sections of the leads .",
    "the positions of the atomic planes @xmath36 and @xmath37 , therefore , do not meet the asymptotic limit criterium as it is formally required by the scattering approach .",
    "however , since the current through the structure is conserved , any position of the planes is suitable for the calculation of conductance",
    ". thus , if @xmath36 is placed somewhere in the scattering region we have to sum up all multiple scattering contributions .",
    "all contributions in direction of the current cause @xmath64 , whereas all multiple scattering contributions in opposite direction of the current give rise to @xmath63 . in the region of the lead where the potential is a small perturbation with respect to the bulk potential",
    "the contribution to the conductance due to @xmath63 is one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath64 . to identify the transmission probabilities of individual eigenchannels the spectrums of the operators @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath63 are arranged in a proper way using the symmetry analysis of eigenvectors . for further details",
    "we refer to ref .  .",
    "most of the structures studied in this work obey the @xmath65 symmetry determined by the fcc ( 001 ) surface ( fig.1 ) .",
    "further we denote individual channels by the indices of the irreducible representations of this group using notations of ref .  ,",
    "common in the band theory .",
    "in addition , each channel can be classified according to the angular momentum contributions when the wave function of the channel is projected on the contact atom of the constriction .",
    "this is very helpful since the channel transmission can be related to the states of the contact atom.@xcite for example , the identity representation @xmath66 of the @xmath65 group is compatible with the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbitals ( here @xmath34 is the axis perpendicular to the surface ) , while the the two - dimensional representation @xmath70 is compatible with the @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 orbitals .",
    "we consider first atomic constrictions shown in fig.1a which are simulated by the straight three atom chains suspended between copper leads with different impurities in the center of the junction .",
    "the calculated conductance value of a pure cu nanocontact is @xmath76 .",
    "only one channel contributes to the total transmission , it has @xmath66 symmetry and is projected on @xmath67 and @xmath68 orbitals of the contact cu atom .",
    "in addition , small contributions from states with higher angular momentum ( @xmath69 and @xmath77 ) are also present .",
    "this result is in agreement with other theoretical studies@xcite as well as with experiments for noble metals.@xcite    we proceed with the discussion of the conducting properties of single @xmath0 atoms ( @xmath78 ) attached to cu electrodes ( fig.1a ) . in fig.2 ( top panel )",
    "we present the conductance together with the eigenchannel decomposition and compare it with the symmetry projected local density of states ( ldos ) at the impurity atom , at the fermi energy ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we observe from fig.2a that the conductance changes significantly depending on the type of @xmath0 impurity bridging the cu leads .",
    "for example , conductance through the sodium atom is smaller than @xmath79 while in case of phosphorus it reaches a value of @xmath80 .",
    "our calculations show that three channels are involved in conductance : one @xmath81-channel of @xmath66 symmetry and a double degenerate channel of @xmath82 symmetry which locally consists of @xmath71 , @xmath72 states when projection on the contact atom is performed . from fig.2",
    "we see that the variation of the eigenchannels transmission with atomic number follows the changes in the orbital resolved ldos at @xmath83 .    in case of na ,",
    "mg and al the transmission is essentially determined by one highly symmetric @xmath66 channel ( fig.2a ) . for sodium",
    "the electronic states at @xmath83 have mainly @xmath67 character ( fig.3 ) but transmission is small because of weak coupling to the cu leads . as we move up to mg and al",
    "the @xmath67 states are filled up with more electrons . at the same time , the @xmath68 states contribute significantly to the ldos at @xmath83 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "that causes a saturation of the @xmath66 channel transmission . for larger atomic numbers",
    "the @xmath66 channel is determined by @xmath68 states only .",
    "the transmission of the @xmath66 channel is reduced again since for si , p and s impurities the @xmath67 states are occupied .",
    "the results of the calculations shown in figs .",
    "2 and 3 reveal that the increase of conductance through si , p and s impurities is due to a virtual bound state formed by @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbitals ( dashed line in fig.3 ) .",
    "this state gives rise to a double degenerate @xmath82 channel .",
    "the @xmath84 resonance , which is situated just above @xmath83 for si , is pinned to the fermi level in case of p , therefore the @xmath82 channel becomes highly open .",
    "for the s impurity the virtual bound state is occupied and the transmission of the @xmath82 channel drops .    to investigate the effect of atomic rearrangements on conductance we moved the @xmath0 atom from its symmetric position .",
    "the nanocontact is now simulated by a zig - zag - like chain suspended between cu leads where the chain is a continuation of the fcc structure along the [ 001 ] direction ( we show the exact geometry in the insert of fig.4 ) .",
    "the behavior of the conductance _ vs _ the atomic number ( fig.4 ) is similar to the previous case : transmission is smaller than 1.0 for na , has a maximum for p and drops down for s. however , the absolute values are different for the two considered configurations .",
    "we found that the conductance consists again of three channels .",
    "since the symmetry is reduced all channels are different and the degeneracy is lost .",
    "the 1st and 2nd channels correspond to an identity representation ( @xmath85 ) of the @xmath86 group , while the 3rd channel is an antisymmetric one ( @xmath87 ) .      as we have seen , when atomic orbitals are present at the fermi level they support additional conducting channels",
    ". that should be also true for the case of @xmath1 transition metal impurities .",
    "they have five localized @xmath89 states nearby @xmath83 which potentially might be involved in the formation of new channels and the conductance could change as compared with @xmath90 found for a cu constriction .",
    "our results for the conductance of the systems with 3@xmath89 transition metal impurities are given in fig.5 .",
    "we consider a single atom contact modelled by a short atomic chain connecting the cu leads , with impurity inside the chain ( fig.1a ) .",
    "indeed , we see that conductance varies in a broad range along the 3@xmath89 series reaching values of about @xmath91 for ti and v , and decreasing to @xmath92 in the case of a ni atom .",
    "we have excluded many body effects ( e.g. , kondo effect ) from the consideration . as an approximation in the calculations",
    "the 3@xmath89 impurities were supposed to have zero magnetic moments .",
    "that could be justified by the fact that at @xmath93 the magnetic moment of the impurity is effectively screened by the conduction electrons .",
    "conductance is found to be a sum of three channels with @xmath66 and @xmath82 symmetry , where the last channel is two fold degenerate .",
    "to understand the behavior of channels transmission ( fig.5a ) we present in fig.5b the symmetry projected ldos at the @xmath1 impurities at the fermi energy , as well as in the vicinity of @xmath83 , for selected atoms ( fig.6 ) .",
    "calculations show that the ldos nearby @xmath83 is formed due to @xmath94 and @xmath1 states of transition metal atoms while @xmath95 states are above @xmath83 and thus play no role for transport . as for @xmath1 states ,",
    "they form sharp resonances localized in the energy window of 1  ev around the fermi level ( fig.6 , low panels ) .",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 resonance states , even if they are situated at the fermi level , do not support open channels .",
    "since the @xmath96 and @xmath97 orbitals are localized perpendicular to the wire axis effective coupling to the neighboring atoms is prevented . consequently , the corresponding resonances look like sharp peaks in the ldos ( fig.6 , down panels ) .",
    "consider first the @xmath82 channel which is projected on @xmath73 , @xmath74 states .",
    "the two - fold degenerate resonance state of this symmetry is situated above @xmath83 in case of sc that leads to a relatively small transmission of the corresponding channel .",
    "when more @xmath89 electrons are present at the contact atom , the @xmath89 states move to lower energies .",
    "in particular , for ti , v and cr the @xmath98 impurity state is situated very close to the fermi level ( fig.6 , down left panel ) and causes high transmission of the @xmath82 channel . for larger atomic number the @xmath98 resonance moves to energies below @xmath83 and transmission of the corresponding channel",
    "is reduced .",
    "the highly symmetric @xmath66 channel is open and is mainly due to @xmath67 states for the first half of the @xmath1 series , from sc to mn .",
    "the increase of the @xmath67 and @xmath69 ldos in case of fe , co and ni ( fig.5b ) is accompanied by a reduction of the transmission .",
    "that is , because of the hybridization between @xmath67 states and the @xmath69 resonance ( fig.6 , down right panel ) with @xmath66 symmetry , the wave function becomes more localized at the impurity atom . from another point of view , the @xmath66 channel is scattered at the @xmath69 impurity state . for cu and zn the @xmath89 states are shifted to energies far below @xmath83 , so that only a single @xmath67-channel is left .",
    "one could expect a variety of different eigenchannels for atomic constrictions made of transition metals .",
    "an example of such a system is a pd pyramid like contact shown in fig.1(b ) , with conductance being @xmath99 .",
    "the ldos at the contact atom is mainly @xmath89-like nearby the fermi energy , as it is seen from fig.7 .",
    "this is also the case for the pd surface . since @xmath89 states of different symmetry are available at the fermi energy ( fig.7 ) , six channels give a main contribution to conductance .",
    "these are one channel of @xmath66 symmetry : @xmath100 ( @xmath81-like ) ; two double generate channels of @xmath82 symmetry : @xmath101 ( @xmath98-like ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath103-like ) ; and one channel of @xmath104 symmetry , @xmath105 ( @xmath96-like ) .",
    "we would like to mention , that the channel with the highest symmetry ( @xmath66 ) has the largest transmission . here , the irreducible representations belong to the @xmath65 group .",
    "let us now study a situation where the contact atom of the otherwise pd junction is substituted by @xmath1 transition metal impurities .",
    "the conductance variation along the @xmath1 series is shown in fig.8 .",
    "we observe that a ni impurity does not affect conductance value of @xmath99 of a pd contact simply because ni is isovalent to pd .",
    "for other impurities conductance changes from @xmath106 in case of sc and zn , up to @xmath107 in the case of a co atom .",
    "eight channels give rise to the total transmission .",
    "results of the individual transmission probabilities are presented in fig.9 ( left column ) together with the ldos at @xmath83 projected on the corresponding orbitals of the impurity atoms ( right column ) .",
    "note , that due to a larger opening angle as compared with the first atomic configuration shown in fig.1 , the channels of @xmath104 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath108 ( @xmath97 ) symmetry contribute significantly to conductance , while they were closed in the case of the cu constrictions with @xmath1 impurities discussed in the previous section .    without showing a detailed structure of the ldos nearby the fermi energy , we mention that a high density at @xmath83 of the @xmath89 states of different symmetry is always related to resonance - like states ( see e.g.  fig.7 for the pd atom ) .",
    "when some of these resonances approach the fermi level , the transmission of the corresponding channel reaches a maximum .",
    "such a situation takes place for the @xmath82 channel ( @xmath98-like ) in case of ni ( fig.9 , middle panels ) , as well as for the @xmath108 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath104 ( @xmath96 ) channels in case of mn and co , respectively ( fig.9 , lower panels ) . for pure @xmath89 channels mentioned above ,",
    "a clear correlation between the partial ldos at @xmath83 and the transmission probabilities is observed .",
    "the other channel of @xmath82 symmetry does not show a strong variation of the transmission _ vs _ the atomic number of the impurity .",
    "this channel is mainly the @xmath109-like .",
    "finally , we note that two different channels of @xmath66 symmetry exhibit an interesting variation .",
    "one of them is @xmath81-like , it is open at the beginning and at the end of the @xmath1 series ( fig.9 , upper panels ) .",
    "the @xmath69 resonance approaching the fermi level in case of mn and fe impurities acts in two ways .",
    "firstly , due to a hybridization with the @xmath67 state it reduces the transmission of the already existing @xmath81 channel ( that is similar to the case discussed in the previous section , fig.5 ) . secondly , the @xmath69 resonance itself opens a new channel of @xmath66 symmetry , which consequently is the @xmath89-like .",
    "its transmission follows the variation of the @xmath69-ldos when the atomic number is changed .",
    "we have learnt from presented examples that conductance properties of individual atoms can be analyzed in detail with help of eigenchannel analysis .",
    "therefore the question arises : can we attribute definite conductance to the particular atom ?",
    "comparing transmission through @xmath1 transition metal impurities attached to cu and pd leads ( fig.5a and fig.8 , respectively ) , we see that the answer to this question is in general negative .",
    "this statement is also confirmed by results presented in fig.10 , where we compare transmission through @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition metal atoms attached to cu electrodes in a different way as it is shown in fig.1 .",
    "we have mentioned in the previous section , that due to a larger opening angle for the incident waves , conductance of pyramid - like constrictions increases as compared to nanocontacts simulated by atomic chains .",
    "the number of non - vanishing conducting channels needed to describe the conductance along @xmath0 and @xmath1 series becomes also larger . without going deep into details ,",
    "we point out that number of eigenmodes increases up to 4 in case of @xmath0 impurities ( fig.10a ) and up to 6 in case @xmath1 transition metal atoms ( fig.10b ) .",
    "in particular , in the latter case , because of the increased coordination number of the contact atom , the @xmath89 channels of @xmath104 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath110 ( @xmath97 ) symmetry become open for ti and mn , respectively .",
    "these channels were closed in the case of a nanocontact modelled by a three atom chain ( see section iii.b for discussion ) .",
    "thus , the presented analysis gives no evidence to attribute a precise value of conductance to the given atom .",
    "a conclusion is that the conductance is sensitive to the geometry of atomic constriction as well as to the type of electrodes .",
    "however , our results show that for the specified single - atomic contact eigenchannels can always be related to the electronic states of the appropriate symmetry at the fermi energy .",
    "in conclusion , based on the kkr green s function method combined with the kubo approach we have performed parameter - free _ ab initio _ calculations of the ballistic conductance through single @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition metal atoms attached to cu and pd leads",
    ". we have investigated in which way the valency of the atom bridging two metallic leads is responsible for the number of conducting channels .",
    "we have found that both the chemical valency of the atom and the opening angle of the atomic constriction determine the number of eigenmodes . in accordance with the known tight - binding model by cuevas _ et al._,@xcite we have confirmed by our study that the symmetry of the open conducting channels is related to the symmetry of the electronic states at the contact site .",
    "that allows to relate the open channels to the orbitals of the contact atom available at the fermi energy .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that impurity resonances approaching the fermi level can open new channels of the appropriate symmetry . on the other hand , in some cases",
    ", the transmission of the existing channels can even be blocked by scattering at virtual bound states which have in this case the symmetry compatible with the symmetry of the open channels .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study of the ballistic electron conductance through @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition metal atoms attached to copper and palladium crystalline electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the _ ab initio _ screened korringa - kohn - rostoker green s function method to calculate the electronic structure of nanocontacts while the ballistic transmission and conductance eigenchannels were obtained by means of the kubo approach as formulated by baranger and stone . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the conductance of the systems is mainly determined by the electronic properties of the atom bridging the macroscopic leads . </S>",
    "<S> we classify the conducting eigenchannels according to the atomic orbitals of the contact atom and the irreducible representations of the symmetry point group of the system that leads to the microscopic understanding of the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if impurity resonances in the density of states of the contact atom appear at the fermi energy , additional channels of appropriate symmetry could open . on the other hand the transmission of the existing channels </S>",
    "<S> could be blocked by impurity scattering . </S>"
