    "in the configuration interaction ( ci ) method the hamiltonian of an interacting system is calculated in the basis of many - electron configurations and diagonalized exactly . unlike the correlated basis of jastrow or hylleraas functions",
    ", the ci basis functions do not automatically include correlations among pairs of electrons , so their repulsive interaction is not minimized .",
    "hence the size and choice of the basis influences the accuracy of results .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) has been an important tool used to investigate the electronic and optical properties of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "not only does it provide benchmark results for the ground state energy and wave function , but also it gives access to excited states and hence permits an interpretation of a number of spectroscopic techniques such as far - infrared @xcite , photoluminescence @xcite , and raman @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , mean - field hartree - fock @xcite , and density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite are restricted to the ground - state properties .",
    "the objective of this work is to present a ci method optimized for the specific problem of interacting electrons in a parabolic dot in a magnetic field .",
    "the optimization explicitly accounts for geometrical and dynamical symmetries of single - particle states , and for many - particle symmetries associated with the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion and total spin .",
    "this results in a reduced basis size and improved accuracy , which in turn allows for a reliable computation of dot properties in the strongly correlated regime .",
    "previous work on total spin and cm - resolved calculations used either the group - theoretical approach limited to a small number of electrons @xcite , or the lowest landau level approximation @xcite . here",
    "we build on these results to construct a reliable and versatile computational tool capable of testing many of the interesting predictions involving electronic correlations in quantum dots .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we focus on the physical properties of our system , discuss the hamiltonian , its symmetries and quantum numbers , and its scaling properties . in sec .",
    "iii we present a total spin- and cm - resolved ci technique .",
    "we compare our results with qmc and stochastic - variational method ( svm ) and with previous results describing the evolution of the electronic droplet with the magnetic field .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional quantum dot with a parabolic confinement potential of strength @xmath0 ( henceforth @xmath1 ) in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath3 particles in real - space representation [ with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the vector potential @xmath6 is : @xmath7 with the zeeman term omitted for simplicity .",
    "here @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the electronic effective mass and charge , respectively , @xmath10 is the cyclotron energy , and @xmath11 is the dielectric constant of the host semiconductor . we can rewrite the one - particle contribution of equation ( [ ham_rss ] ) to obtain @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hybrid frequency and @xmath14 is the angular momentum operator . introducing the effective length @xmath15 , and scaling all lengths in the units of @xmath16 and energies in effective rydbergs @xmath17 results in a dimensionless hamiltonian , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the effective bohr radius and @xmath20 being the magnetic length .",
    "therefore , the larger the effective length or the smaller the hybrid frequency , the larger the contribution from electron - electron interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham_rss ] ) exhibits another scaling property . to see it we rewrite it as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and @xmath3 and separate the contribution of the angular momentum .",
    "this concept is similar to the modification of the hamiltonian of a ( natural ) atom in ref .",
    "@xcite . @xmath22",
    "the total hamiltonian is therefore a sum of a hamiltonian of a dot in zero magnetic field with the confinement frequency @xmath23 , and the total angular momentum contribution @xmath24 . as a result",
    "we can map the spectra and wave functions of a dot in the presence of the magnetic field to those at zero field .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) implies that the energy levels of subspaces with different angular momenta are shifted against each other due to the term @xmath24 , whereas within a specific subspace of the angular momentum the energy levels are fixed relative to each other . therefore , ground states in high magnetic fields are excited states in zero field and a suitable choice of a finite basis is not trivial .",
    "the choice of the basis is facilitated by the properties of the one- and the many - particle hamiltonian .",
    "the properties of the one - electron hamiltonian are easily understood by a transformation from the momentum and position representation ( @xmath25 ) into the language of harmonic - oscillator raising and lowering operators @xcite : @xmath26 with the energy spectrum @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and the two oscillator frequencies @xmath29 .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator spectrum is equivalent to the spectrum derived independently by fock @xcite and darwin @xcite ( the fock - darwin spectrum , fd ) applying different methods .",
    "the corresponding states are denoted by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the electronic spin .",
    "the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator @xmath32 , the spin @xmath33 , and its @xmath34-component @xmath35 are good quantum numbers .",
    "in addition , there are dynamical symmetries associated with the form of the confining potential .",
    "these symmetries lead to degeneracies of the harmonic - oscillator spectrum at @xmath36 and also at finite fields whenever @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .    for numerical calculations",
    "it is useful to resort to the language of second quantization .",
    "the hamiltonian of @xmath3 particles in second quantization with fermion creation @xmath39 and annihilation @xmath40 operators can be written as : @xmath41 where the composite index @xmath42 ( similarly @xmath43 ) denotes the harmonic - oscillator quantum numbers .",
    "the coulomb matrix elements @xmath44 are given explicitely in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham_2q ] ) conserves total spin , total z - component of spin , @xmath45 , and total angular momentum , @xmath46 .",
    "apart from the spin and the geometrical and dynamical symmetries discussed above , the many particle hamiltonian ( [ ham_2q ] ) has also a hidden symmetry related to the separability of the cm and relative motion @xcite .",
    "the cm symmetry can be expressed by the introduction of new operators describing collective cm excitations of the system : @xmath47 the operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) satisfy the following commutation relation with the full interacting hamiltonian @xmath52 : @xmath53= \\omega_\\pm\\hat a_\\pm^\\dag $ ] and @xmath54=-\\omega_\\pm\\hat a_\\pm$ ] .",
    "they can be interpreted as creation ( annihilation ) operators for collective excitations of the system since they increase ( decrease ) the energy of the system by @xmath55 .",
    "they allow for the construction of exact eigenstates of the interacting system .",
    "we can now explicitly define cm operators @xmath56 which commute with the interacting hamiltonian : @xmath57    because slater determinants constructed from a fd basis set are eigenstates of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , it is natural to resolve the total angular momentum @xmath60 and the total spin in @xmath34-direction @xmath61 as good quantum numbers . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 in second quantization is similar to that of the coulomb interaction , involving two creation and two annihilation operators . in what follows",
    "we construct ed methods which make use of these operators to reduce the size of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the form of the total spin operator in the language of creation and annihilation operators is : @xmath64 its last term annihilates one particle in a state @xmath65 and recreates it on the same orbital , but with flipped spin ; the same is true for the orbital @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the pattern of orbital quantum numbers is conserved , which makes it possible to arrange the slater determinants in blocks which enclose all states with the same pattern , and to rotate the single blocks into eigenstates of @xmath62 .",
    "the size of the blocks can be obtained using combinatoric arguments .",
    "we start with a given electron number @xmath3 , among which @xmath67 electrons are spin up , and @xmath68 spin down , and we distribute them on @xmath69 orbitals ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "because of pauli s exclusion principle we get @xmath71 thus we have @xmath72 doubly occupied orbitals ( singlets ) , @xmath73 unpaired spins up , and @xmath74 unpaired spins down . the distribution of the singlets is determined by pauli s principle .",
    "the number of different orbitals available for unpaired spins up and unpaired spins down is @xmath75 .",
    "the size of the block equals the number of all possible distributions of unpaired electrons spin up and down on @xmath75 orbitals : @xmath76 in table [ block1 ] we show the number of total spin eigenstates per block for a six - electron system as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath77 .",
    "these blocks are fairly small ( e.g. , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) and the diagonalization of the blocks has to be done only once for each value of @xmath69 .    in table [ matrix_red ] we show how the size of the hamiltonian is reduced by applying the scheme on a system with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 slater determinants and on a system with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 slater determinants .",
    "note that for even electron numbers @xmath3",
    "the largest subspace is that of @xmath88 , not @xmath89 . in the case of odd @xmath3",
    "the @xmath90 subspace is larger than the others .",
    ".number of total spin eigenstates per block for a six - electron system as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath61 .",
    "[ block1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    to illustrate the method and compare it with previous work @xcite we show the results for four electrons in the range of magnetic fields @xmath91  t for gaas parameters ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , confinement energy @xmath94 mev , and one and two landau levels . in fig .",
    "[ figcm ] we show the energies of the ground and the two lowest - lying excited states of each subspace @xmath60 , @xmath95 with @xmath96 , without the zeeman energy ( @xmath97 ) .     to @xmath98 calculated in the two - landau - level approximation .",
    "the confinement energy is @xmath99 mev and the zeeman energy is neglected .",
    "all these states are eigenstates of the center - of - mass operator with the quantum number @xmath96 ; solid lines correspond to total spin for @xmath89 , dashed lines - to @xmath88 , and dotted lines to @xmath100 .",

    "[ figcm ] exhibits an energy band consisting of ground states of all @xmath95-subspaces , is separated from the excited states by @xmath101 mev ( marked by the double arrow ) . since the energy needed to construct an excitation of the cm motion is of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath102 mev for @xmath103 t and higher for smaller magnetic fields ) , this separation clearly shows that the lowest - lying excited states of the quantum dot for magnetic field between @xmath104 and @xmath103 t are all excitations of the relative motion .    in fig .",
    "[ figcmphase ] we show the evolution of the ground state energy with the magnetic field in the one- and two - landau - level approximation with gaas zeeman energy ( g=-0.44 ) .",
    "mev and gaas zeeman energy ( @xmath105 ) as a function of the magnetic field from 0 to @xmath103 t in one - landau - level ( a ) and two - landau - level approximation ( b ) .",
    "[ figcmphase ] , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in the one - landau - level approximation we do not find the hund s rule state expected at @xmath36 nor the @xmath106 spin - singlet droplet with @xmath89 , @xmath107 .",
    "the first quantum hall state is the spin - polarized state with @xmath100 , @xmath108 .",

    "we still miss the hund s rule @xmath36 state , but recover the @xmath106 state with @xmath108 and @xmath89 .    the qualitative agreement between the lowest- ( fig .  [ figcmphase](a ) ) and two - landau - level ( fig .  [ figcmphase](b ) )",
    "approach is good for high magnetic fields , i.e. , beyond the @xmath110 quantum hall droplet .",
    "the only difference is the @xmath111 phase which is present in fig .",
    "[ figcmphase](a ) , and missing in fig .",
    "[ figcmphase](b ) .",
    "the absence of the low - spin phase is due to the weakening of coulomb interactions by inclusion of higher landau levels .",
    "the second effect is that the fields corresponding to the ground - state transitions are lower in the one - landau - level due to the fact that in this approximation the correlation effects are underestimated .",
    "an advantage of the ci method over qmc and svm methods is the ability to calculate excited states . in fig .",

    "[ figexcit](a ) we plot the energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excited state with the same @xmath61 ( selection rule @xmath116 , without restrictions for the quantum numbers @xmath60 , @xmath95 ) .",
    "this selection rule applies to charge excitations .",
    "consequently , we can not expect a systematic increase of the gap as a function of the zeeman energy .",
    "all the structures in the diagram for increasing zeeman energy are caused by transitions to higher polarized states .",
    "in contrast , we used the selection rule @xmath112 for fig .",
    "[ figexcit](b ) .",
    "this kind of excitation should be observed in microwave - radiation or in spin - flip - raman experiments .",
    "the characteristic features in this case are energy gaps linearly growing with zeeman energy .",
    "this behavior is especially pronounced in the regime of the @xmath110 droplet around @xmath117 t and in the regime of the @xmath114 droplet around @xmath118 t , where both ground and first excited state are stable .",
    "we presented a configuration interaction method optimized for fock - darwin states of two - dimensional quantum dots with an axially symmetric parabolic confinement potential subject to perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the optimization explicitly accounts for geometrical and dynamical symmetries of fock - darwin single - particle states and for many - particle symmetries associated with the center - of - mass motion and with total spin . as a key element we introduced a block structure to cluster slater determinants which are coupled by @xmath62 and/or @xmath119 . by diagonalizing these small blocks we managed to rotate the many - particle basis set into eigenstates of @xmath62 and/or @xmath119 , and used them to calculate the hamiltonian matrix",
    "this reduced the size of the basis set and increased the accuracy of exact diagonalization calculations for quantum dots .",
    "the results compare well with available quantum monte - carlo and stochastic - variational results .",
    "thus we show that the ci method gives reliable results for the ground and excited states and allows to study the effects of electron correlation and the magnetic field over a broad range of system parameters .",
