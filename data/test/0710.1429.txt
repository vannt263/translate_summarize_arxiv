    "the use of general principles to investigate systems whose microscopic makeup is unclear can be very rewarding .",
    "sometimes this method gives information on a whole class of systems . among such principles , thermodynamics ,",
    "believed to be of universal applicability , stands out .",
    "an instructive example of its use is the application of the second law of thermodynamics to the problem of viscous flow , for which it permits the inference that the two viscosity coefficients must be positive without need to resort to microscopic expressions for the latter  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the generalization of the second law of thermodynamics holding in the presence of black holes ( the generalized second law  gsl ) to reach further conclusions about the shear viscosity coefficient of an arbitrary fluid .",
    "we do this by describing a new paradox for ideal fluid flow in the presence of a black hole .",
    "this indicates that the correlation length of a real fluid can not be arbitrarily small . by implication the energy - momentum tensors",
    "describing systems which display macroscopic fluid behavior must be subject to a restriction : the shear viscosity , a function of the thermodynamic state of the system , can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "thereby the gsl opens an alternative macroscopic approach to the recently proposed lower bound on viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the gsl is a unique law of physics that bridges thermodynamics and gravity .",
    "it is rooted in the understanding that a black hole , basically a pure gravity entity , is endowed with well defined entropy  @xcite proportional to its surface area .",
    "the gsl  @xcite then claims that the sum of the entropy of all black holes and the total ordinary entropy in the black holes exterior never decreases .",
    "while this formulation is reminiscent of the ordinary second law , the gsl is exceptional in that it relates ordinary entropy  a rather elusive object from the mechanical viewpoint  and the surface area of the black hole ( formally the area of its horizon ) whose evolution is quite mechanical in nature . from this point of view",
    "it is little surprise that the gsl has provided unexpected information on entropy .",
    "an example is the upper bound on the entropy of weakly self - gravitating thermodynamic systems ( the universal bound on entropy  ube  @xcite ) .",
    "while in particular cases the bound can be verified directly , it is the gsl which really makes understanding of the bound in generic situations easy .",
    "however , the gsl gives more than just a simpler way to see some results derivable by other means . at the microscopic level the gsl represents a piece of the yet to be established theory of quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , this law permits , in principle , to draw conclusions that from the microscopic viewpoint would only be derivable from a fundamental theory combining quantum mechanics with gravity .",
    "for example , the gsl gives an indication of the number of particle species in nature  @xcite .",
    "in another example , the gsl reveals an _ a priori _ bound on the strength of the electromagnetic interaction  @xcite .",
    "let us now describe the ideal fluid paradox revealed by invoking the gsl .",
    "we assume the existence of physical fluids with arbitrarily small shear viscosity @xmath0 at fixed values of some two thermodynamic variables , say the entropy and the energy densities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "( in this work we consider only simple fluids , so the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 completely determine the thermodynamic state of the system . ) here  physical \" means , among other things , that the fluid satisfies the gsl ; this could , in principle , be checked by considering the fluid at the microscopic level , but we shall not go into such detail .",
    "the assumption that the fluid has arbitrarily small viscosity allows us to describe its flow as ideal fluid flow , possibly with shocks ( the zero viscosity limit of a given flow can be non - trivial ; see refs .",
    "it turns out , as we shall show , that for sufficiently slow accretion of the fluid onto the black hole the overall entropy decreases and the gsl is violated .",
    "the realizability , in principle , of such slow accretion flows will be demonstrated , so that the small viscosity assumption engenders a paradox .    of course",
    ", ideal fluid paradoxa exist already in non - relativistic physics , for example , the famous dalembert paradox .",
    "this maintains that an ideal fluid with no boundaries exerts no force whatsoever on a body moving through it with constant velocity .",
    "in particular , there is no lift force , so swimming or flying would be impossible in such a fluid .",
    "thus the established fact that swimming is possible in any fluid implies that every real fluid must have nonzero viscosity .",
    "there is however an essential difference between the dalembert paradox and the paradox described in this work .",
    "dalembert s paradox says nothing about the actual magnitude of @xmath0 . in contrast , our paradox implies , as we shall see , the existence of a lower bound on @xmath0 for given @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is in concord with the recent ingenious conjecture of kovtun , starinets and son ( kss )   @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . based on holographic calculations of the viscosity coefficient for certain",
    "strongly coupled quantum field theories with gravity duals , they suggested that the viscosity @xmath0 of a general , possibly non - relativistic , fluid is subject to the universal restriction @xmath3 currently this bound is considered a conjecture well supported for a certain class of field theories  see the detailed discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . in the sequel",
    "we discuss the relation between the ideal fluid paradox presented in the next section and the kss bound .",
    "we also argue that a frequent objection to the validity of the kss bound is likely to be ruled out by the gsl .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ paradx ] we show explicitly that the slow accretion of a truly ideal fluid onto a schwarzschild black hole leads to a contradiction with the gsl .",
    "one escapes from the paradox by recognizing that every fluid must have a nonvanishing correlation length which restricts the range of applicability of the ideal fluid paradigm . in sec .",
    "[ kssp ] we obtain a lower bound on the correlation length and a generic estimate of the viscosity of real fluids , which together bound the viscosity to entropy density ratio from below . although this is not yet the kss bound , we consider there the connection between it and the ube , and argue that the gsl provides a natural frame for elucidation of the origin of the former . in the sec .",
    "[ summary ] we summarize our results and arguments .",

    "[ paradx ] is demonstrated in the appendix .    unless otherwise stated , we work in units with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is speed of light and @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "our metric signature is @xmath7 .",
    "in the present section we consider ideal fluid flow into a spherical black hole . for some flows ,",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible for the gsl to be violated so that the total entropy of the system decreases .",
    "it follows that the assumption of a perfect continuum down to an arbitrarily small scale is not consistent with the gsl .",
    "consider a flow , not necessarily spherically symmetric , in which fluid is absorbed by the black hole .",
    "the rate of change of the total entropy @xmath8 of the system is the sum of the rate of change of the entropy of the black hole exterior , @xmath9 , and that of the black hole entropy @xmath10 : @xmath11 here and below we use schwarzschild coordinates @xmath12 , with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we first calculate @xmath15 .",
    "let the fluid s proper entropy density be @xmath1 .",
    "since the fluid is assumed ideal , there is no dissipative contribution to the entropy current density which is thus purely convective , and must take the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fluid four - velocity .",
    "the fluid can carry entropy into the hole leading to a decrease of @xmath9 .",
    "the explicit expression for this comes from the entropy balance equation  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the determinant of the schwarzschild metric @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath15 of the black hole exterior ( @xmath21 ) is thus @xmath22 we have not included a contribution from the outer boundary of the domain of integration because we intend to specialize to stationary flows . in any such situation the entropy flow into the hole per unit @xmath23-time is given by the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ exterior ] ) .",
    "the expression is non - positive because @xmath24 for infalling matter .",
    "we have assumed that the flow is differentiable , and that it contains no shocks ; otherwise there exists an additional contribution to @xmath15 associated with the entropy generation in the shocks  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the second term of the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) .",
    "the absorption of the fluid by the black hole increases the latter s mass @xmath25 , producing an increase in the black hole entropy given through energy conservation by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the black hole temperature , and @xmath25 is its mass .",
    "we shall now write down the flux of energy into the black hole .",
    "let @xmath28 be the killing vector associated with the stationarity of the black hole .",
    "then the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid , @xmath29 , must obey @xmath30 or equivalently @xmath31 since @xmath32 is _ minus _ the energy density of the fluid , @xmath33    the energy - momentum tensor of the ideal fluid is given by @xmath34 where @xmath2 is the energy density and @xmath35 is the pressure in the comoving frame .",
    "consider now the normalization condition @xmath36 , written as @xmath37.\\ ] ] since @xmath38 and @xmath39 are physical velocity components , they should be bounded at @xmath40 .",
    "hence since @xmath41 is future and inwardly pointed , and @xmath42 as @xmath43 , we can infer from the last equation that @xmath44 at the horizon . combining all the above we find @xmath45 thus @xmath46 in harmony with hawking s area theorem  @xcite .",
    "we observe from eqs .",
    "( [ exterior ] ) and  ( [ black ] ) that while the ( negative ) rate of change of @xmath9 is proportional to the first power of @xmath47 , the ( positive ) rate of change of the black hole entropy is proportional to the _ second _ power of @xmath47 .",
    "thus for sufficiently small @xmath48 , the total entropy of the system will _ decrease _ , in violation of the gsl .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath49,\\ ] ] where we stress that at the horizon @xmath47 is never positive .",
    "we observe that when the accretion velocity @xmath50 ( the suitable mean value of @xmath51 over the horizon ) obeys @xmath52 the total entropy decreases and the gsl is broken .",
    "we now proceed to search for such flows .",
    "we first reconsider known explicit solutions .",
    "the above formulae apply for a generic , not necessarily spherically symmetric , accretion flow onto the black hole ; in particular it may have non - vanishing @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as an example , consider the well known bondi flow ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bondi flow starts from rest at infinity and is spherically symmetric . for a polytropic equation of state , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the adiabatic exponent ,",
    "the accretion velocity is given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "it follows that bondi flow will obey the gsl if the following condition holds : @xmath61 we have used the usual expression @xmath62 for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the above conditions would seem to obtain for any fluid with positive pressure thanks to the ube  @xcite .",
    "this bound states that the entropy @xmath63 of a generic , weakly self - gravitating , thermodynamic system satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the body s total energy , while @xmath66 is its linear size .",
    "our experience is that the inequality here is usually a strong one .",
    "now the minimal size of a parcel of fluid consistent with the fluid description is its correlation length @xmath67 . for a gas , @xmath67 is the mean free path , while for a liquid it is typically the intermolecular distance .",
    "applied to such a parcel the ube tells us that ( see the next section for more details ) @xmath68 where we have passed from the total entropy and energy to their densities by dividing by the parcel s proper volume .",
    "again , this bound will in most cases be a strong inequality .",
    "since the continuum description down to accretion at the black hole makes sense only if @xmath69 , we may conclude that the inequalities  ( [ bondi ] ) will always hold with at least one order of magnitude difference between the r.h.s . and the l.h.s . of the equations",
    "in the above argument we have tacitly assumed that @xmath70 .",
    "negative pressure is often discussed in cosmology ( dark energy ) ; the functioning of the gsl in the face of dark energy is fraught with subtleties  @xcite .",
    "thus bondi flow satisfies the gsl by virtue of the ube .",
    "clearly , this happens because the accretion velocity approaches the speed of light , @xmath71 .",
    "we now turn to examples of slow ideal fluid accretion flows that do violate the gsl .",
    "it is clear from the previous analysis that the gsl holds for any accretion flow of ideal fluid with @xmath71 .",
    "we expect such flows whenever spherical accretion starts from a distance @xmath72 from the black hole large compared to @xmath14 ( for bondi flow @xmath73 ) .",
    "but what is @xmath50 in the limit @xmath74 ?",
    "we now show that @xmath50 vanishes in that limit , thereby giving an example of ideal fluid flow that violates the gsl .",
    "we study steady , spherically symmetric accretion flow which starts at @xmath75 with the initial flow and sound velocities , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , specified there .",
    "we assume that the relevant initial conditions are physically realizable ; see the appendix for the discussion of this assumption .",

    "@xcite we introduce @xmath78 .",

    "obviously @xmath84 is always positive due to the causality constraint @xmath85 ( sound velocity is smaller than velocity of light )  @xcite .",
    "here we consider only flows with @xmath86 so @xmath87 at the horizon",
    ".    in bondi flow @xmath88 becomes negative at large @xmath89 which signifies that there exists the so - called sonic radius @xmath90 such that @xmath91 . as is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ derivs ] ) , where @xmath88 stands in the denominator , the sonic radius is a special though regular point of the bondi flow , which in other situations could signify the presence a shock .",
    "by contrast , here we shall choose a range of initial parameters for the flow which ensure that @xmath92 , so that there is no sonic point .",
    "we assume initial parameters for the flow satisfying @xmath93 it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) that @xmath94 is indeed positive .",
    "we do not need to derive the explicit form of the flow in order to find @xmath50 .",
    "it suffices to consider the conservation of the bernoulli integral along the streamlines .",
    "the relativistic version of the bernoulli equation reads  @xcite @xmath95 assuming for simplicity the polytropic equation of state  ( [ poly ] ) one finds the following relation @xcite @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the baryon mass .",
    "the above relation allows us to rewrite the bernoulli equation as @xmath98 evaluating the above equation first at @xmath40 and then at @xmath75 , equating the results , using inequalities  ( [ in1])-([in2 ] ) and assuming that at the horizon @xmath99 remains much smaller than unity ( which we have verified numerically ) , we find that @xmath100 where the ellipsis stands for subleading terms .",

    "it will thus incur a violation of the gsl .    of course for the above argument to be convincing",
    ", we must still demonstrate that it is possible for a flow to start near the horizon with sufficiently small velocity ( and sound speed ) . in the appendix",
    "we show in detail that a cord which respects fundamental physical constraints can be used to bring objects to rest arbitrarily near the horizon .",
    "one can envision the setting up of the initial conditions for the fluid we require at @xmath75 by this means .",
    "the above violation of the gsl raises a paradox . in the real world",
    "the gsl can not be violated .",
    "this law has been shown to follow from fundamental concepts in quantum theory and classical gravity  @xcite .",
    "can the paradox be removed without calling on new physics just for the occasion ?",
    "an obvious solution would be to call on hawking s radiance to generate entropy that would at least compensate for the decrement of total entropy pointed out in sec .",
    "[ paradox ] . after all , in free hawking emission the thermal radiation entropy creation rate exceeds the associated rate of decrease of the black hole entropy  @xcite .",
    "but there exist reasons to reject this as the resolution of our problem .",
    "the hawking radiation is capable of preventing a violation of the gsl that would arise if high entropy radiation of the same nature , i.e. , electromagnetic , were injected into a black hole with @xmath104 above the effective radiation temperature  @xcite .",
    "its efficacy here is related to the principle of detailed balance in equilibrium ( in fact , for incoming thermal radiation at temperature @xmath104 the hawking radiation exactly balances the entropy decrement ) .",
    "now detailed balance refers to modes of the same physical system .",
    "there is no detailed balance between radiation and fluid modes .",
    "thus if entropic radiation were injected alongside the fluid accretion , the hawking radiation might prove incapable of compensating for the entropy decreases of the two kinds .",

    "the moral of the discussion is that a paradox arises if one relies on the continuum description of a fluid down to an arbitrarily small scale , that is if one takes the notion of ideal fluid literally . to be rid of paradoxa one must take cognizance of the finite correlation length of any physical fluid , _ and _",

    "in particular , the picture of a fluid as a perfect continuum is shown to be physically unacceptable : the fluid in question must have a nonvanishing correlation length . the medium is a fluid only over scales exceeding the correlation length .",
    "it turns out that finiteness of the correlation length is incompatible with the vanishing of various transport coefficients like shear viscosity and heat conductivity , another feature of the ideal fluid paradigm . for a gas",
    "there is a simple way to see this .",
    "the usual estimates of the mentioned transport coefficients  @xcite have them proportional to the mean free path of the gas molecules .",

    "this means that the expressions for the entropy and energy densities themselves become dependent on @xmath113 .",
    "the system is no longer a continuum .",
    "can one set a lower bound on the correlation radius @xmath67 purely from macroscopic considerations ?",
    "the standard answer to the above question would be in the negative .",
    "but , surprisingly , the true answer is yes .",
    "as we have seen , for a macroscopic system the ube can be restated in the form  ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) , which immediately leads to the inequality @xmath117 the main point here is that a macroscopic system with size much smaller than @xmath118 would violate the ube ; thus the correlation length can not be much smaller .",
    "we emphasize , again , that @xmath67 may easily be much larger than the minimal scale  ( [ bekenstein11 ] ) .",
    "the above result answers the following question : given a macroscopic system with given entropy and energy densities , what is its minimal possible correlation length ?",
    "it shows that macroscopic quantities do  know \" about the minimal correlation length of the system .",
    "we mentioned earlier that a nonvanishing correlation length @xmath67 ensures that the transport coefficients of a gas ( which are proportional to @xmath67 ) do not vanish .",
    "for example , for shear viscosity one has the order of magnitude estimate  @xcite @xmath119 where the speed of sound @xmath83 is of the order of molecular speed  @xcite .",
    "the above estimate together with eq .

    "we note that , for any fluid , density perturbations at scale much larger than @xmath67 generate sound waves . on the other hand , perturbations with scale much smaller than @xmath67",
    "are not coherent and produce no sound .",
    "furthermore , one can still use hydrodynamics asymptotically to describe the evolution of perturbations with scale @xmath67 .",
    "then the demand that there is no well - defined sound at smaller scales gives the asymptotic condition that at scale @xmath67 the wave decay time @xmath122 , as found from hydrodynamics  @xcite , should be comparable with the wave period @xmath123 .",
    "this produces the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) for liquids .",
    "alternatively , the results  ( [ estimate])-([new1 ] ) can be recovered by considering a sound wave already propagating through the liquid .",
    "its fourier components with reduced wavelengths near or below @xmath67 should decay over a distance comparable to @xmath67 since we can not have macroscopic flow at those smaller scales .",
    "now from the _ macroscopic _ point of view , the decay must be caused by transport processes controlled by the viscosities or heat conductivity . according to fluid theory  @xcite , a sound wave of wavelength @xmath124 penetrates a distance of order @xmath125 into the liquid before damping out . according to the above argument , for @xmath126 this penetration length should be @xmath67 , which gives eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) again .    for relativistic fluids the above consideration should be modified slightly . here",

    "the above estimates , however , must fail sufficiently close to a critical point .",

    "the reason for the failure of the estimate is complications in the asymptotic matching procedure above , related to the difference of the critical exponents of the various quantities involved .",
    "another issue is that near a critical point the static correlation length @xmath67 becomes different from the scale beyond which hydrodynamics applies .     of experimental viscosities of eleven pure liquids ( data taken mostly from ref .",

    "let us now turn to the lower bound on the viscosity - entropy density ratio  ( [ new1 ] ) .",

    "specifically , for the high energy results of rhic one has @xmath150 using this and estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) we have @xmath151 where in the last step we assumed @xmath147 at @xmath152 mev , @xmath153 fm corresponding to a number density @xmath154 /@xmath144 , and employed @xmath155 mev fm .",
    "our estimate for the qgp viscosity is thus in harmony with the kss bound  ( [ kss ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is in quite reasonable agreement with the experimental data which require a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio as low as @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "we draw attention to the similarity between inequality  ( [ new1 ] ) with @xmath5 and @xmath157 restored , namely @xmath158 and the conjectured kss bound  ( [ kss ] ) . at first sight",
    "this inequality seems to fall well below the kss bound since in many cases @xmath159 .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that , especially in such nonrelativistic circumstances , we expect the inequality to be a strong one .",
    "the minimum @xmath120 may thus be well above the literal bound  ( [ new2 ] ) , and not necessarily at variance with eq .",
    "( [ kss ] ) . for relativistic media @xmath160 , and there is no difference to speak of between bounds  ( [ kss ] ) and  ( [ new2 ] ) .",
    "thus arguments based on the ube , and ultimately on the gsl , seem to suggest a _",
    "raison dtre _ for the mysterious kss bound .    before",
    "proceeding we wish to provide an alternative viewpoint .",
    "the kss bound eq .",
    "( [ kss ] ) is usually interpreted as saying that a fluid can not be too perfect .",
    "however , in the form @xmath161 the bound is really an entropy bound , specifically an upper bound on the entropy density of an arbitrary fluid ( we return to the use of units with @xmath162 as in the previous sections ) .",
    "clearly the above bound is reminiscent of the ube , eq .",
    "( [ bekensteinentropy ] ) , and its fluids version , eq .",
    "( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) .",
    "but at least for non - relativistic fluids , the kss bound is a tighter entropy bound by orders of magnitude than the ube . restoring the speed of light @xmath5 we introduce the variable @xmath163 ( @xmath67 being , again , the correlation length , either the mean free path for a gas , or , typically , the intermolecular separation for a liquid ) which has the dimensions of viscosity .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) gives @xmath164 . using the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) we have @xmath165 .",
    "it follows that for nonrelativistic fluids eq .",
    "( [ kssentropy ] ) is indeed a much tighter entropy bound than eq .",
    "( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) .",
    "thus the kss bound can be viewed as a tightened version of the ube in guise of eq .",
    "( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) which is available for the class of systems exhibiting macroscopic fluid behavior .    both the ideal fluid paradox of sec .  [ paradox ] and the interpretation of the kss bound as an entropy bound for fluids suggest the gsl as a natural frame for investigating relations between entropy bounds .",
    "because the ube is obtained in the most transparent way via the gsl , one may hope that the kss bound should likewise be obtainable most simply with help of the gsl .",
    "we turn now to considerations in this direction .",
    "first we remark that it is not clear how to obtain the kss bound directly from microscopic physics .",
    "inspection of the green - kubo formula  @xcite for the viscosity in terms of fluctuations shows no apparent connection of the viscosity and the entropy .",
    "such consideration affords no special status to the ratio @xmath120 , at least not from the viewpoint of nongravitational physics .",
    "on the other hand , the kss conjecture emerged from holographic type arguments that connect quantum field theory with gravity .",
    "it might thus turn out that a derivation of the kss bound requires use of the still nonexistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "but even if this were true , one need not loose heart .",
    "there is general agreement that black hole entropy , and the gsl which hinges on it , reflect some aspect of quantum gravity .",
    "the kss is not universally accepted .",
    "many objections to it rely on scenarios where very many particle species are supposed to exist in nature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an example and references ) .",
    "these are the same objections raised against the validity of the ube ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for references ) .",
    "in fact , any entropy bound whatsoever invites attacks of this sort , for if the number of species that may show up is unlimited , the entropy can be made as large as desired while keeping parameters like energy or total particle number fixed .",
    "although it is formally true that with many species available , the kss bound must fail , this does not detract from its heuristic usefulness ; one is often interested on the entropy of a specific system , one whose particle content is fixed ahead of time .",
    "it should also be mentioned that many particle scenarios , if not arbitrarily legislating particle proliferation , conjure up fine - tuned or baroque setups to beget the required large number of species of quasiparticles or excitations .",
    "this aspect considerably decreases the appeal of the species proliferation arguments .",
    "both of the above considerations make it clear that a ground up approach to deriving the kss bound is unlikely to succeed .",
    "alternative , indirect approaches are needed . a point in favor of employing the gsl to investigate the origin of the kss bound",
    "is that the gsl  knows \" the actual number of species in nature  @xcite .",
    "for example , black hole entropy , which plays a crucial role in the gsl , should in principle depend on the number of elementary fields , yet all derivations endow it with a fixed coefficient which may be thought as determined by the actual number of species .",
    "this feature would act to neutralize the above mentioned argument against the validity of the kss bounds .",
    "we have worked out the expression for the rate of change of the total entropy of a system consisting of a schwarzschild black hole and ideal fluid which can accrete onto the hole .",
    "the well known bondi flow is the case of fast accretion with velocity near to the speed of light ; for it the gsl is always obeyed due to the ube . for sufficiently slow accretion velocity",
    "the flow violates the gsl .",
    "the question of whether flow with the required small accretion velocity is a realistic option is answered in the affirmative by a critical revision , in the appendix , of the venerable argument  @xcite claiming that it is impossible to adiabatically lower mass to near the black hole horizon .",
    "since it is known from microscopic considerations  @xcite that any physical system should comply with the gsl , the above result would constitute a serious paradox if the ideal fluid is a continuum , as usually considered .",
    "we find , however , that the paradox can be defused if one takes into account that the continuum picture must break down at some level by virtue of the fluid having a nonvanishing correlation length .",
    "an auxiliary role in the nullification of the paradox is played by the universal entropy bound .",
    "it gives a lower bound on the correlation length in relation to the fluid s entropy density .",
    "the lower bound on the correlation length of an arbitrary thermodynamic system in terms of its ( macroscopic ) entropy and energy densities is an unexpected and thought - provoking aspect of the ube .",
    "it makes it clear that the gsl , though a macroscopic law , `` knows '' about the microscopic structure of matter .",
    "the lower bound must rank as one of the most impressive consequences of the extension of the second law of thermodynamics to include black holes .",
    "the breakdown of the continuum description of a fluid has momentous consequences : discreteness of matter and thermal fluctuations necessarily engender nonideal behavior parameterized by the viscosity and heat conduction coefficients .",
    "we have shown that one can expect the existence of a universal lower bound on the viscosity of an arbitrary fluid .",
    "our argument yields a seemingly novel estimate for the viscosity of a fluid far from the critical region ; this estimate is shown to be better than an order of magnitude estimate for a range of pure liquids .",
    "in addition , the estimate works reasonably well for the quark - gluon plasma , which viscosity was a subject of much study lately @xcite .",
    "together with the lower bound on the correlation length , the viscosity estimate yields a lower bound on viscosity per unit entropy density which may be expressed in terms of the sound velocity of the fluid .",
    "the appearance of the speed of sound here , in contrast to the ( implicit ) speed of light in the original kss arguments , may signify that the kss argument can be improved , or may perhaps disclose that the field theories considered by kss as representatives of strongly coupled fluids are not sufficiently generic  in all these theories the sound velocity is comparable with the speed of light .",
    "an additional issue is whether the bound can be extended to other transport coefficients .",
    "if there is indeed a lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to entropy density for an arbitrary fluid , then it is likely to be rooted in some very basic principle of physics .",
    "we have shown that the generalized second law of thermodynamics , combining as it does gravity with thermodynamics , can be such a principle .",
    "starting from it , one can anticipate that the viscosity to entropy ratio of an arbitrary fluid obeys a certain lower bound .",
    "in particular , the gsl incorporates physics that weakens the recent objections  @xcite to the bound s very existence . on the basis of the above",
    ", we propose that the use of the gsl may lead to a clarification of the kss bound s origin .",
    "although we have made no concrete progress towards reaching a final sharp inequality , we have given for the first time physical arguments indicating that this elusive bound , whose existence is sometimes disputed , indeed exists .",

    "gibbons  @xcite claimed that one can not lower a rope to near a black hole at an arbitrarily small velocity , without it being torn at some finite distance from the horizon .",
    "the conclusion was based upon the assertion that the stresses that arise in the rope become so strong that they violate the weak energy condition @xcite which must be obeyed by the energy - momentum tensor of physical matter . here",
    "we reexamine the problem and show that , in fact , the energy condition need not be violated and thus that adiabatic lowering down to the horizon is , in principle , possible .    in the stationary state of some matter in the vicinity of a spherical black hole ,",
    "the energy momentum tensor obeys @xmath166 where we used the symmetry of @xmath167  @xcite .",
    "below we concentrate on configurations for which @xmath168 is diagonal . using the same coordinates as in sec .",
    "[ balance ] , the @xmath169 component of the above equations is satisfied automatically , while the radial component gives @xmath170    the above equation gives a linear relation between the different components of the stress tensor which need not , _ a priori _ , respect the weak energy condition . as an example , consider a thin spherical shell in equilibrium . for the shell",
    "the contribution of @xmath171 in the above equation is negligible .",
    "this can be seen by noting that @xmath171 vanishes at the shell boundaries , and as a result its values within the shell vanish together with the ratio of shell thickness to radius . far from the hole , where the shell is describable by the classical linear elasticity theory ,",
    "the maximal value of @xmath171 is found to be proportional to the square of the above ratio .",
    "so the thin shell is basically supported by the tangential stresses @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which must be equal because of spherical symmetry .",
    "( [ radial ] ) gives @xmath174 .",
    "now the weak energy condition would demand @xmath175 .",
    "it is thus clear that a stationary thin shell would violate the condition at @xmath176 .",

    "@xcite for the more detailed discussion ) .    ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the rope can not be in equilibrium with its lower end arbitrarily close to the black hole , similarly to the thin shell above . here",
    "we wish to correct this conclusion .",
    "we shall assume that the rope fibers can be considered radial , such as in the case of a conical rope filling the portion of space defined by some solid angle .",

( [ radial ] ) gives @xmath178    the above linear equation can be used to express the stress @xmath179 in terms of the rope density @xmath2 and the boundary condition at the lower end of the rope , @xmath180 , which is defined by the load .",
    "the solution can be written as a sum @xmath181 , where @xmath182 describes the stresses caused by the load , while @xmath183 describes the stresses caused by the rope s own weight .",

    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) that the maximum of @xmath193 , at given @xmath189 and @xmath25 , grows as @xmath194 decreases . this just means that the maximal stress is the bigger the closer the lower end of the rope is from the horizon .",
