    "experimental data of vector meson photoproductions are now being rapidly accumulated at bonn @xcite , thomas jefferson national accelerator facility @xcite , graal of grenoble @xcite , and leps of spring-8 @xcite .",
    "the study of photoproduction of vector mesons ( @xmath6 ) is expected to be useful to resolve the so - called `` missing resonances '' problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , the extracted resonance parameters can shed lights on the structure of nucleon resonances ( @xmath7 ) and can be used to test the existing hadron models . in recent years",
    ", some theoretical progress has been made @xcite in this direction . in this work",
    "we will address the question about how these earlier models should be improved for a more reliable extraction of the @xmath7 parameters from the forthcoming data . to be specific ,",
    "we consider the photoproduction of @xmath0 meson .",
    "it is well known that the extraction of @xmath7 parameters from experimental data depends strongly on the accuracy of the treatment of the non - resonant amplitudes . in all of the recent studies of @xmath0 photoproduction at resonance region @xcite ,",
    "the non - resonant amplitudes are calculated from the tree diagrams of effective lagrangians .",
    "this is obviously not satisfactory for the following reasons .",
    "first , the tree - diagram models do not include the hadronic final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "the importance of fsi in interpreting the data has been demonstrated in the study of pion photoproductions .",
    "for example , the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that the magnetic @xmath8 amplitude of the @xmath9 transition can be identified with the predictions from constituent quark models only when the pion re - scattering effects ( i.e. , pion cloud effects ) , as required by the unitary condition , are accounted for appropriately in analyzing the data .",
    "second , the vector meson productions occur in the energy region where several meson - nucleon channels are open and their influence must be accounted for .",
    "this coupled - channel effect was already noticed and explored in 1970 s for vector meson photoproduction @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make a first attempt to re - investigate this problem in conjunction with the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a dynamical formulation , such as that developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most ideal approach is to carry out a coupled - channel calculation . at energies near the @xmath0 photoproduction threshold , the meson - baryon channels which must be included in a coupled - channel calculation are many , such as @xmath4 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , and @xmath11 .",
    "such a full coupled - channel calculation is not feasible at the present stage , mainly because some of the experimental information that are needed to constrain the transitions between relevant hadronic meson - baryon channels are not available .",
    "for example , there is no information about @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions .",
    "we therefore are only able to consider just the effects due to intermediate @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels . in this exploratory investigation , we will follow ref .",
    "@xcite to further simplify the calculations by only considering the one - loop corrections which are the leading order terms in a perturbation expansion of a full coupled - channel formulation , as will be explained in sec .",
    "ii . nevertheless , our results will shed some lights on the importance of coupled - channel effects and provide information for developing a much more complex full coupled - channel calculation .",
    "in many respects , our investigation is similar to a recent investigation of coupled - channel effects on kaon photoproduction @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a coupled - channel formulation of @xmath14 reaction and indicate the procedures for calculating the one - loop corrections to @xmath0 photoproduction .",

    "numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v. some details on the @xmath3 reaction are given in appendix .",
    "in the considered energy region , the @xmath14 reaction is a multi - channel multi - resonance problem . in this work",
    "we follow the dynamical approach developed by sato and lee @xcite to investigate this problem .",
    "it is done by simply extending the scattering formulation of ref .",

    "<S> one - loop corrections to @xmath0 photoproduction near threshold have been investigated by using the approximation that all relevant transition amplitudes are calculated from the tree diagrams of effective lagrangians . with the parameters constrained by the data of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 reactions , it is found that the one - loop effects due to the intermediate @xmath4 and @xmath5 states can significantly change the differential cross sections and spin observables . </S>",
    "<S> the results from this exploratory investigation suggest strongly that the coupled - channel effects should be taken into account in extracting reliable resonance parameters from the data of vector meson photoproduction in the resonance region . </S>"
