    "violation of charge - parity ( @xmath0 ) symmetry beyond the standard model ( sm ) has yet to be observed but we suspect that it must be there in order to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this gives paramount importance to new searches for @xmath0 violation in high - energy frontier .",
    "one tool , proposed many years ago , for searches in collider experiments is the use of triple - product correlations  @xcite , which are simple kinematic correlations of the form @xmath7 .",
    "these correlations are referred to as `` naive-@xmath8 '' odd because they reverse sign under the `` naive-@xmath8 '' operation that reverses the direction of momenta and spin without interchanging initial and final states . in general ,",
    "correlations of this form can be @xmath0 even or @xmath0 odd , as they are induced by either loop level unitarity phases or by @xmath0 violating phases respectively . in top - quark pair production , these triple - product correlations originate in @xmath0 violating spin correlations with the top - quark ( and anti - quark ) weak decay acting as spin analyzer .    there exist several recent proposals to search for @xmath0 violation at the lhc using triple - product correlations .",
    "our discussion is based on observables discussed for anomalous top - quark couplings in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as observables discussed for multi - higgs models in ref .",
    "additional processes that have been discussed recently include @xmath9 and @xmath10 pair production and decay  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath0 conserving `` naive-@xmath8 '' odd triple - product correlations have been studied in radiative top - quark decay  @xcite at one - loop level .",
    "in this paper we consider triple - product correlations in top - quark pair production at the lhc , induced by new @xmath0 violating interactions in a scalar sector extended with a color - octet electroweak - doublet as described in ref .",
    "this model incorporates the additional scalars in a manner consistent with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) in order to naturally suppress flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .    of particular interest to us",
    "are the two neutral , color - octet , scalar resonances that occur in the model , @xmath4 .",
    "these particles couple at the one - loop level to two gluons and their production at the lhc has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 conserving case .",
    "these particles also couple ( dominantly ) to top - quark pairs which makes them an ideal candidate to study @xmath0 violation in the process @xmath11 .",
    "to this end , we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to include @xmath0 violation , which can occur both in the couplings of @xmath4 to top - quark pairs as well as in certain self - interactions in the scalar potential .",
    "we further assume that top - quark decay proceeds as in the sm and serves only to analyze the corresponding spin . within this framework",
    "we find that relatively large raw asymmetries are possible , as large as @xmath12 .",
    "these raw asymmetries are diluted by the sm top - quark pairs and their observation is contingent on the resonance itself being observable . for illustration",
    ", we present a set of parameters for which the resonance is visible over the sm background and the resulting @xmath0 asymmetry can be as large as a few percent",
    ". we also comment on other channels where @xmath0 asymmetries are potentially visible in cases where the single resonance is not .",
    "the lhc has already established new constraints on the new physics beyond the sm , even though it has been operating so far with a reduced energy of 7  tev . in particular ,",
    "both atlas and cms have excluded certain color - octet scalars similar to the ones we consider here in a broad mass range  @xcite by studying the dijet channel .",
    "these exclusion limits , while interesting , do not apply to the models we discuss , where the color - octet resonances decay almost exclusively into top - quark pairs .",
    "their decay modes into dijets occur with branching ratios below @xmath13 for the sets of parameters we use in this study .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the relevant aspects of the model for the color - octet scalars with emphasis on the @xmath0 violating phases that have not been studied previously . in section iii",
    "we study several benchmark cases that illustrate the generic properties of the raw @xmath0 asymmetries .",
    "we also discuss several aspects concerning the observability of the @xmath0 violating signals at the lhc . in section",
    "iv we state our conclusions and , finally , we relegate some analytic formulae to the appendix .",
    "we briefly review the case of a scalar sector that has been extended with a color - octet electroweak - doublet scalar with hypercharge @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "this particular choice is motivated by the requirement of mfv and has been recently elaborated in ref .",
    "it was noted in these papers that in a mfv scenario only scalars with the same gauge quantum numbers as the sm higgs doublet @xmath16 or color - octet scalars with the same weak quantum number as the higgs doublet @xmath17 can couple to quarks , and this has many interesting consequences for both collider and flavor physics .",
    "this color - octet electroweak doublet can be written in the properly normalized component form with the color index @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 generator normalized as @xmath22 .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the color - octet scalars can be parameterized , to the leading order , with the mfv assumption as  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the diagonalized mass matrices , @xmath25 ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the up and down quarks , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; and @xmath30  gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath31 .",
    "the neutral complex field @xmath32 can be further decomposed into a scalar @xmath33 and a pseudo - scalar @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",

    "if the mass of color - octet scalars is not too large , a tree - level interaction can pair produce them at the lhc through the process @xmath49 .",
    "since the color - octet scalars also couple to quarks , there is an additional contribution from @xmath50 .",
    "however this contribution is small because the yukawa couplings of @xmath41 to quarks are proportional to quark masses .",
    "single @xmath41 production is also possible at tree level from its yukawa couplings to quarks , but this tree - level contribution is small as it is proportional to the light - quark mass . it has been shown that the single @xmath41 production cross section at the lhc is dominated by a loop induced @xmath51 interaction and can be of order @xmath52  fb for masses of order a few hundred gev to a tev  @xcite . if these resonances are produced at the lhc , it will be possible to study their properties , including @xmath0 violation , through their decays to sm particles .",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath53 although there is also one - loop induced decay into gluon pair : @xmath54  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study signals of @xmath0 violation at the lhc .",
    "this is accomplished by first observing the resonant production of the neutral color - octet scalars @xmath4 through their effective @xmath51 couplings and then studying the correlations that occur in the subsequent decay chain : @xmath55 .",
    "the new sources of @xmath0 violation induce triple - product correlations involving the spin of the top and anti - top quarks which are subsequently analyzed by their weak decays . in the dimuon mode",
    "chosen above , it is the direction of the muons that analyzes the spin directions .",
