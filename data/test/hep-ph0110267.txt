    "it is widely believed that quarks , the basic building blocks of strongly interacting matter , lose their confinement at some large density or temperature , at or near the chiral phase transition .",
    "many models , for example the instanton liquid model , suggest that the unconfined quarks exert an attractive force on each other .",
    "the bcs mechanism predicts that an arbitrarily weak attractive force leads to an instability of the fermi - surface , giving rise to a colour superconductor @xcite .",
    "this new phase of quark matter has been the subject of many papers in recent years ; see ref .",

    "the interplay of the order parameter with the flavour symmetry ( either su(2 ) or su(3 ) , since only the lightest quarks are relevant ) can generate many interesting phases .",
    "these include the two - flavour colour superconductor ( 2sc ) which pairs quarks of different flavour and colour and leaves one colour unpaired @xcite ; the colour flavour locked phase ( cfl ) which is possible in the three - flavour case @xcite ; and the crystalline colour superconducting phase @xcite . in general , a robust colour superconducting gap of the order of @xmath0 has been predicted by calculations which use different interactions and different superconducting states .",
    "the density at which the maximum pairing occurs is several times nuclear density .",
    "an important question is what happens in finite systems .",
    "if we ever succeed in creating such a phase in the lab , it must occur in finite , colour - singlet , states .",
    "equally , if we have a nugget of quark matter at the centre of a neutron star , we expect it to be colour neutral , since it originates from the compression of a colour neutral object and is surrounded by colour neutral matter .",
    "the techniques with which to discuss such phenomena have long been used in nuclear physics , where the superfluid nature of finite nuclei should not be described by the number - non - conserving bcs state , but by a projected one @xcite .",
    "the additional complication here is the requirement of colour neutrality , since the cooper pairs in 2sc superconductivity are colour anti - triplets .",
    "hence an additional projection onto a colour - singlet state is required .",
    "in contrast the cooper pairs in nuclear physics already carry zero angular momentum .    in this work",
    "we will use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite and work at zero temperature .",
    "we limit our study to the simplest state , the 2sc .",
    "we model the effects of finite size by confining the quarks to a cubic box with antiperiodic boundary conditions . as a result boundary effects",
    "are not included .",
    "after projection the exact equations for the superconducting gap are very involved , so in this work we confine ourselves to a one - parameter variation . with these limitations , we find that the superconducting gap persists after , though not always before , projection in systems of finite size .",
    "finite size effects in superconducting matter have also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that the stability of small lumps of cfl matter was enhanced . in that paper",
    "however the emphasis was on thermodynamic effects ; shell structure and projection onto states of good quantum numbers were not considered .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we describe the model and fix the notation ; in section [ sec : numb_proj ] we apply the projection over baryon number to the 2sc and obtain an expression for the expectation value of the energy in this projected state ; in section [ sec : colour_proj ] we apply the projection over the colour singlet to the 2sc and generalise the expression given in the previous section . in section [ sec : res ] we give the numerical results , and finally , in section [ sec : concl ] we state our conclusions .",
    "the reader will find technical details and some useful formulae in the appendices [ app:1 ] and [ app:2 ] .",
    "we wish to investigate the effects of finite size , definite baryon number and colour neutrality on the colour superconducting state .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a variety of models have been so far used to study the emergence of colour superconductivity .",

    "we leave for future work the study of more complex scenarios .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we model the attractive interaction responsible for the pairing of quarks at large densities with a contact four - quark interaction whose form is suggested by the instanton - induced interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian then has the form @xmath1 with    @xmath2    where flavour and colour indices are latin and greek respectively , and the tensor @xmath3 is given by @xmath4    at zero density the quarks acquire a dynamical mass , through the generation of a chiral condensate .",
    "this mass drops as the density increases , reaching zero at the chiral phase transition . at higher densities the colour condensate which signals the onset of colour superconductivity forms .    in order to regularise the contributions stemming from large momenta , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have supplemented the interaction ( [ eq : hint1 ] ) with a form factor , to be associated with each quark of a given momentum .",
    "we choose to use a form factor of the form @xmath5    the parameter @xmath6 determines the sharpness of the cut - off , and has been taken to be 10 .",
    "this leaves two free parameters , @xmath7 and the coupling constant @xmath8 in the interaction .",
    "these are fixed at zero density by requiring the pion decay constant to have its physical value , and by choosing the dynamically generated quark mass to be 400  mev ; this gives @xmath9  mev and @xmath10  mev@xmath11 .",
    "the modes of the fields are quantised in the standard way , and we define the creation operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 for particles , antiparticles and holes relative to the fermi sea , @xmath15 , which can thus be written as @xmath16 for all three colours are equal .",

    "thus although in principle we can project a state of a given baryon number from any bcs state , in practice we choose values of @xmath99 where the expectation value of the number of pairs in the unprojected bcs state has the value desired in the projected state ( see fig .  [",

    "we therefore restrict our projection to this state .",
    "thus the only operator which acts non - trivially is @xmath117 , which is non - diagonal in the colour space and connects one of the two paired colours with the remaining one . as a result we are able to reduce the integration over the eight different angles @xmath118 in eq .",

    "[ fig : gap_l3 ] we show the superconducting gap as a function of chemical potential for a range of box sizes .",
    "the dashed line is the finite - volume unprojected gap , and for comparison the continuous line shows the result for the infinite - volume case .",
    "we remind the reader that because we perform only a limited variation after projection , as explained above , the projection can only be done for certain discrete values of @xmath46 for which the average net number of pairs in the unprojected bcs state is zero . at these points",
    "we show results for the unprojected bcs ( circles , which must coincide with the dashed line ) , and for the number - projected ( triangle up ) and combined number - colour projected bcs ( triangle down ) .",
    "the most striking finite - volume effect is the disappearance of the gap for values of @xmath46 which are far from shells .",
    "these regions are confined to very low @xmath46 for boxes above 3  fm in length . in these regions",
    "the effects of projection on the gap can be striking , as can be seen even at 7  fm .",
    "however in all other regions , where the unprojected gap does not disappear , projection has very limited effect . in general the results for colour and number projection lie above those for number projection alone ; the latter show almost no difference from the unprojected case unless the unprojected gap vanishes .",
    "the effect of finite size on the energy of the condensate has already been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsize1 ] .",
    "the effect of projection is to lower the energy by less than 1  mev even for the smallest boxes considered . in the approach to the infinite - volume limit ,",
    "shell effects for the unpaired quarks vanish more slowly than finite - size or projection effects on the condensate .",
    "in this work we have studied the effects of finite size over the colour superconducting state , by considering quark matter at finite density and zero temperature enclosed in a cubic box .",
    "we have considered the 2sc superconducting state of ref .",
    "@xcite and we have calculated the effects of the projection over definite baryon number and over a colour singlet state . the most significant finite size effect is the vanishing of the gap for values of the chemical potential between widely spaced shells . for these cases ,",
    "projection has a significant effect , restoring a sizeable gap .",
    "otherwise the effects of projection are slight , though in all cases each projection increases the gap to some degree .",
    "this behaviour points to the interesting possibility that the interplay between the chiral and the superconducting phase can also change in a finite system .",
    "this hypothesis can be verified by extending the present calculation , allowing a competition between the two phases .",
    "this topic is currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "there are other aspects which require future investigation as well : it would be interesting to extend our results to more general form of pairing interactions , rather than the simple `` instanton - motivated '' interaction of eq.([eq : hint1 ] ) . for technical reasons ,",
    "the number projection which was carried out exactly in the present work , would require more effort in a general case , where the interaction contributions will contain not only terms which mix the helicity , such as @xmath148 , but also terms which connect fermions with the same helicity , such as @xmath149",
    ". it would be more appropriate in such cases to apply approximate number projection techniques , which have been developed in the contest of nuclear theory @xcite .",
    "another aspect of interest , which we plan to investigate in the future , is the effect of the colour projection on different superconducting states , and in particular on the colour - flavour locked phase ( cfl ) , which was originally studied in @xcite .",
    "because in this state the colour and flavour degrees of freedom are `` locked '' , the colour projection will affect both colour and flavour , and could possibly yield larger effects than the one observed in the case of the 2sc .",
    "we also remark that in the present analysis we have not performed a full variation after projection .",
    "instead we have followed a simpler approach , assuming for the solution the same functional form as in the unprojected case and obtaining the numerical solution by performing a minimization of the total energy with respect to the gap @xmath36 .",
