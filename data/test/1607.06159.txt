    "the physical reality of the metric can , as noticed by van dantzig @xcite , hardly be `` ... denied by anyone who has ever been pricked by a needle , i.e. who has _ felt _",
    "its rigidity and the smallness of its curvature . ''",
    "yes , we felt this , too , repeatedly .",
    "that is , the reality of the metric is beyond doubt .",
    "still , as whittaker observed , there are phenomena in physics that are independent of the metric or for which the metric turns out to be irrelevant .",
    "if you count the number of electrons within a prescribed domain , for example , this number does not refer to a length measurement  and a domain , a container , can be defined without the necessity to have a length measure available .",
    "historically , the _ premetric program _ in physics was first clearly spelled out by friedrich kottler in 1922 in two papers on `` newton s law and metric '' and on `` maxwell s equations and metric '' @xcite .",
    "a short history of the subject is provided in whittaker s book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vol.2 , pp .",
    "192196 ) to which we refer for more details",
    ". we will discuss kottler s two papers in a modern formalism and will show that the premetric nature of newton s ( non - relativistic ) gravitational attraction law is phenomenologically not as well grounded as that of the maxwell equations .",
    "however , in relativistic theories of gravity , the premetric program leads to a better understanding of the interdependence between topological , affine , and metric concepts , that is , between those concepts related to the surgery of a manifold , to parallel transfer , and to spatio - temporal distances , respectively .    in van dantzig s nomenclature",
    "@xcite , the premetric maxwell equations are called `` fundamental equations '' whereas the set of metric - dependent `` linking equations '' relates the excitations to the field strengths , and the potentials to the currents ( typically by ohm s law ) .",
    "the linking equations depend on the properties of the vacuum or of the matter involved .",
    "they can be adapted to the structure of the `` material '' considered , whereas the fundamental equations are , on the classical level , unalterable .",
    "this qualitative difference between premetric and metric quantities is also reflected in the universal constants of physics ; for an overview of the fundamental constants , see flowers & petley @xcite and mohr et al .",
    "there are universal scalars , like the planck constant @xmath0 , the elementary charge @xmath1 , the magnetic flux quantum @xmath2 , which are invariant under all coordinate transformations ( that is , under the diffeomorphism group )",
    ". they all can be counted .",
    "today single electrons , for example , can be manipulated by nanotechnological means .",
    "in contrast , the speed of light is only a p(oincar)-scalar , cf .",
    "fleischmann @xcite .",
    "it is merely invariant under the rigid poincar transformation of the flat minkowski space of special relativity .",
    "since a speed requires for its measurement spatial and temporal distances , the speed of light @xmath3 is metric - dependent and is , in this sense , less fundamental than @xmath4 . we all know this since",
    "the deflection of light near the sun has been experimentally confirmed .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 is only `` universal '' provided gravity can be neglected .",
    "since in our terrestrial laboratories gravity is relatively weak , it can be neglected if @xmath3 is measured .    in secs.2 to 5 , we display , in a modern disguise , kottler s electrodynamic results of 1922 . in sec.2 ,",
    "a premetric 3-vector calculus is set up . in sec.3",
    ", we start from a 4-dimensional premetric version of the maxwell equations in the calculus of exterior differential forms and put the maxwell equations into the formalism of sec.2 ; for textbook representations , one could compare with schouten @xcite , bamberg & sternberg @xcite , and scheck @xcite",
    ".    in sec.4this section can be skipped at a first reading ",
    "the jump condition at the boundaries between different materials are directly derived from the premetric maxwell equations . in sec.5 , the maxwell - lorentz constitutive law for vacuum electrodynamics",
    "is presented . here",
    ", for the first time , the metric of spacetime enters electrodynamics .",
    "this concludes our review of kottler s results @xcite of 1922 on electrodynamics .",
    "sec.5 immediately invites to a reflection about the physical dimensions and units in electrodynamics and on the fundamental universal constants involved .",
    "this is done in sec.6 , in particular the status of the electric constant @xmath5 and the magnetic constant @xmath6 are elucidated and the josephson and the von klitzing constants put into a proper perspective .",
    "next we turn to kottler s version of newton s gravity . in sec.7",
    "the corresponding results of kottler are presented in 3-vector calculus and in exterior differential forms .",
    "we are not aware of other literature on these thought - provoking considerations of kottler .",
    "subsequently , in sec.8 , we can extend these gravitoelectric results of kottler by introducing gravitomagnetism",
    ". we will follow ideas that were pronounced already by heaviside @xcite .",
    "this will us lead to quasi - maxwellian gravitational field equations , which will be interpreted in terms ( i ) of _ general relativity _ and ( ii ) of the _ teleparallelism theory _ of gravity . in the former approach gravitomagnetism",
    "defies a proper premetric framework , in the latter approach , however , the gravitational field variable is premetric ( namely the coframe ) and the constitutive assumption seems to be the requirement of the coframe to be orthonormal .",
    "this appears to be in the sense of the kottler idea .    in sec.9",
    "we will postulate a premetric local and linear response law for classical electrodynamics , starting from ideas developed in sec.6.4 .",
    "this law will thoroughly be studied in secs.10 and 11 . in particular",
    ", we will find out that we can _ derive _ a conformal metric by insisting on the vanishing of birefringence in the medium under considerations .",
    "in this way , we found a new way to understand the emergence of the concept of a metric of spacetime .",
    "in sec.12 we will show that even the signature of the metric can be understood this way and that it is related to the sign of the electromagnetic energy and the lenz rule in the context of faraday s induction law . in sec.13",
    "we conclude with some remarks .",
    "_ a short curriculum vitae of friedrich kottler ( fk ) _ ( @xmath7vienna 1886 , @xmath8rochester , new york 1965 ) : fk was born as a son of a lutheran attorney - at - law and a jewish mother .",
    "he was a theoretical physicist , who first worked in relativity theory .",
    "he got a ph.d .  in 1912 on spacetime lines in minkowski s world . from 1914 to 1918 , fk served as an officer in the austrian army during the first world war . already in 1918 , he wrote an extended paper on a detailed analysis of einstein s gravitational theory @xcite . in 1922",
    "he studied the role of the metric tensor in newton s gravitational theory and in electrodynamics . during the late 1920s , fk turned to optics , inter alia , and till 1938 was an academic teacher and professor at the university of vienna .    in 1938 , apparently because of political reasons and of his jewish mother , he was fired from his position by the nazis ( austria and germany were united at this time ) , and he emigrated to the us .",
    "there , he worked in industry with the eastman kodak company , once a dominant player in the photographic film sector .",
    "fk became an american citizen in 1945 .",
    "around 1955 , fk wanted to retire at kodak and tried to get his university position back .",
    "the university of vienna made him an honorary professor of mathematical physics , but fk informed the university that he could not teach before the winter term of 1956/57 .",
    "the teaching of fk in vienna , however , apparently never materialized .",
    "a short cv of fk up to 1938 is available @xcite , written by fk himself .",
    "it was sent to einstein and pauli in order to help fk to find a position in the us .",
    "havas @xcite , in a monograph by goenner , renn , ritter , and sauer @xcite , gave a very insightful review of the development of the relativity theory in austria from 1900 to 1938 , therein the role of kottler is also clearly visible .",
    "an obituary of fk of the vienna university can be found under @xcite .",
    "although one can hardly overestimate the importance of the metric in physics , it is remarkable how far one can go in the development of meaningful differential - geometrical tools for direct applications in field theory .",
    "we begin with the discussion of a 3-dimensional space @xmath9 .",
    "we will _ not _ assume any riemannian metric to be defined on it . here we will demonstrate that , despite a widely spread belief , one can construct , essentially , a 3-vector calculus without any metric .",
    "let @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , be local coordinates in some chart that we choose in such a way that the vectors @xmath12 are linearly independent at any point of the chart .",
    "thus , they form a coordinate basis of the tangent space . consequently , the three 1-forms @xmath13 comprise a basis of the cotangent space at any point , being dual to the coordinate frame @xmath14 , that is , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the interior product of a vector with a form . since @xmath13 is a coframe , the 3-form @xmath17 is defined in this local chart .",
    "one immediately notices , though , that @xmath18 is _ not _ invariant under the change of coordinates . indeed , under a transformation @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 thus",
    ", the 3-form @xmath18 is a _ density _ of the _ weight _ @xmath21 .",
    "there are more densities of various ( exterior ) ranks .",
    "namely , we define the set of three 2-forms by @xmath22 , the set of three 1-forms @xmath23 , and , finally , an object @xmath24 . from ( [ eps ] ) it is clear that these forms are all densities of weight @xmath21 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath25 is a covector - valued 2-form , @xmath26 an antisymmetric 2-tensor - valued 1-form , and @xmath27 is a totally antisymmetric 3-tensor density .    from the definition @xmath28",
    ", we have @xmath29 . other components of @xmath27 are equal @xmath30 for even / odd permutations of the indices 1,2,3 , or zero when any two indices coincide .",
    "moreover , the components of this object ( levi - civita symbol ) have the _ same values in all local coordinates_. indeed , under a transformation @xmath31 we find @xmath32 we can uniquely define a similar object @xmath33 as the solution of the equation @xmath34}_{k}$ ] .",
    "this is a density of weight @xmath35 , and the brackets @xmath36}$ ] denote antisymmetrization of the indices involved , see schouten @xcite .",
    "one may wonder of how to use these objects . with their help",
    "we can , to a certain extent , circumvent the absence of metric in @xmath9 and construct a substitute of the full - fledged vector calculus .",
    "we call it _ the poor man s vector calculus , _ since at one s disposal there are only the operations of the exterior @xmath37 and the interior @xmath16 products and of the exterior differential @xmath38 .",
    "to begin with , let us consider an arbitrary 1-form ( or covector ) @xmath39",
    ". in local coordinates it is represented by its components @xmath40 according to @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that we can work equally well with the _ components _ @xmath40 , keeping in mind their properties under coordinate transformations .",
    "let us now calculate the exterior differential @xmath42",
    ". in local coordinates it reads : @xmath43 the vector valued 2-form density @xmath25 forms the basis in the space of 2-forms .",
    "it has the components @xmath44 comparing ( [ rot1 ] ) with ( [ epsa ] ) , we can define a differential operator @xmath45 which maps covectors into vector densities of the weight @xmath35 . in the exterior",
    "form language it is defined implicitly by @xmath46 or explicitly in components by @xmath47    one can check directly that @xmath48 transforms as @xmath49 that is , like a vector density of the weight @xmath35 .",
    "likewise , given an arbitrary 2-form @xmath50 , we can consider its expansion with respect to the basis of 2-forms @xmath25 , namely @xmath51 .",
    "this defines a mapping of the antisymmetric tensor components @xmath52 into the components of a vector density of the weight @xmath35 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath53 in particular , for any two covectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 , a `` vector product '' is defined which maps them into a vector density @xmath56^a$ ] of weight @xmath35 , via the relation @xmath56^a\\epsilon_a:=v\\wedge u$ ] .",
    "this mapping allows to define one more differential operator , this time acting on 2-forms .",
    "at first , one immediately sees that @xmath57 consider now the exterior differential of a 2-form @xmath58 . using its expansion with respect to @xmath25 and the property ( [ dxeps ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath59 , which defines the @xmath60 operator : it maps antisymmetric 2-tensors into scalar densities of weight @xmath35 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath61 one can straightforwardly verify the transformation law under the change of the local coordinates @xmath19 : @xmath62    equivalently , one can write the operators ( [ rot ] ) and ( [ dive ] ) with the help of the totally antisymmetric tensor density : @xmath63 we collected our main results in table i. in the next section , we extend this three - vector formalism to four spacetime dimensions .",
    "* table i. * premetric differential operators ( we use only partial derivatives ! )    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this analysis is based on the assumption of the positivity of the electric and magnetic energy densities .",
    "in contrast , the ordinary description of metamaterials allows for the negative energies . in this case , the standard dufay and lenz rules are recovered in our model , too .",
    "let us examine now the most general premetric linear constitutive relation ( [ const1])([const2 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath64 and @xmath65 consequently , the energy density ( [ em - energy * ] ) takes the form @xmath66 in the first two terms we recognize the electric and magnetic energies , respectively .",
    "for the standard lorentzian signature with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the matrix @xmath69 must be negative definite and the matrix @xmath70 must be positive definite .",
    "this result yields positive definiteness of the matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we should mention that by introducing generalized concepts of stress and hyperstress , one can set up a kind of a _ premetric elasticity _ theory , as shown by gronwald et al .",
    "only if one relates this framework to the classical euler stress , which is symmetric , one has to eventually to introduce the metric tensor .",
    "moreover , favaro ( private communication ) has pointed out that , in non equilibrium statistical mechanics , the _ fokker - planck equation _ can be formulated in a premetric way .",
    "the kottler program was intended to remove the metric from the fundamental equations in physics as far as possible .",
    "since the metric is the gravitational potential in general relativity theory , kottler s program does not apply here .",
    "however , in the teleparallel version of gravity , it seems possible to carry through the kottler program , although the details will have to be seen . in classical electrodynamics ,",
    "kottler s path led to a resounding success and , see sec.11 , to a new understanding of the emergence of the metric tensor together with a dilaton , an axion , and a skewon field .",
    "all these fields , together with the metric , come into existence in an electrodynamic context .",
    "these remarkable facts are not yet completely understood .",
    "in particular , only a first attempt was started to develop a theory for a skewon field @xcite , for which some cosmic limits were set by ni @xcite .",
    "we would like to extend our sincere thanks to wei - tou ni ( hsin - chu ) for his encouragement to write up this article .",
    "quite a number of colleagues contributed appreciably to our understanding of the subject of our investigation .",
    "we are most grateful to the following people : to alberto favaro ( london ) for many detailed discussions on the foundations of electrodynamics and on kummer surfaces ; to enzo tonti ( trieste ) for advice on the operational interpretation of electrodynamics ; to naresh dadhich ( pune ) and to claus kiefer ( cologne ) for insight on fundamental constants ; to reinhard meinel ( jena ) on gravitomagnetism ; to hubert goenner ( gttingen ) and , particularly , to tilman sauer ( mainz ) ( gttingen ) for help in historical questions ; to daniel braun ( tbingen ) for discussions on the precision with which the speed of light can be measured ; to ari sihvola ( espoo ) for explanations to @xcite ; and to achim rosch ( cologne ) for decisive hints to copper selenide .",

    "<S> we will discuss the basics of the premetric approach and some of its beautiful consequences , like the division of universal constants into two classes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that classical electrodynamics can be developed without a metric quite straightforwardly : the maxwell equations , together with a local and linear response law for electromagnetic media , admit a consistent premetric formulation . </S>",
    "<S> kottler s program succeeds here without provisos . in kottler s </S>",
    "<S> approach to gravity , making the theory relativistic , two premetric quasi - maxwellian field equations arise , but their field variables , if interpreted in terms of general relativity , do depend on the metric . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can hope to bring the kottler idea to work by using the teleparallelism equivalent of general relativity , where the gravitational potential , the coframe , can be chosen in a premetric way .    </S>",
    "<S> _ since the notion of metric is a complicated one , which requires measurements with clocks and scales , generally with _ rigid    _ bodies , which themselves are systems of great complexity , it seems undesirable to take metric as fundamental , particularly for phenomena which are simpler and actually independent of it . </S>",
