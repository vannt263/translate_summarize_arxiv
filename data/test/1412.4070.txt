    "within the usual wisdom it is quite intuitive to accept that a complex many - body dynamics could lead to a homogeneous spreading of an initially localized excitation .",
    "such a process , which in the context of spin systems has long been known as _ spin diffusion _ , would lead to the system equilibration .",
    "however , this nave concept soon encounters limitations . on one hand",
    ", p. w. anderson discovered that certain conditions preclude the spreading @xcite .",
    "this problem still generates controversy , as the question on when do closed many - body quantum systems equilibrate remains open @xcite . on the other hand , even in conditions where the spin diffusion seems irreversible , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments revealed that the apparently equilibrated state contains correlations encoding a memory of the initial state @xcite . the pioneer in this field was e. hahn . in his spin echo @xcite ,",
    "the precession dynamics of each independent spin is reversed by changing the sign of the local magnetic fields . in those experiments ,",
    "the many - spin interaction is not reversed and consistently it degrades the echo signal in a characteristic time @xmath2 .",
    "two decades later , rhim , pines and waugh exploited the fact that the spin - spin dipolar interaction can also be reversed @xcite .",
    "this allows for the reversal of a global polarization state in the form of a magic echo .",
    "more specific was the development by r. ernst and collab .",
    "there , a local spin excitation diffuses through a lattice much as an ink - drop diffuses in a pond .",
    "a pulse sequence produces its refocusing , followed by the local detection as a polarization echo ernst1992 .",
    "again , the attenuation of the observed echo can be tentatively attributed to the non - inverted terms in the hamiltonian , as well as imperfections in the pulse sequence and interactions with some environment .    in a follow up of those experiments , a quest on quantifying the sources that degrade the echo signal in crystalline samples",
    "was initiated patricia98,usaj - physicaa , molphys .",
    "as the sources of irreversibility can be progressively reduced , one might think that there are no limits in the experimental improvement of the echo .",
    "nevertheless , in systems where a local excitation equilibrates mesoeco - prl1995,mesoeco - exp , experiments show that even weak perturbations are highly effective in producing the echo degradation . moreover , there are cases where the time scale of the decay is intrinsic to the reversed dynamics , i.e. a perturbation independent decay ( pid ) usaj - physicaa , molphys .",
    "if confirmed , this observation could have deep implications for the degree of controllability of quantum devices as it evidences a fragility of quantum dynamics towards minuscule perturbations .",
    "in fact , the sensitivity to perturbations or fragility of quantum systems @xcite is a major problem that transversally affects several fields , e.g. chaos in quantum computers shepelyansky2000,flambaum2000a , nmr quantum information processing karina09,*claudia2014,boutis2012,cappellaro2013 , quantum criticality zanardi2006,silva2008 and , more recently , quantum control theory calarco2014 .    in order to capture the essentials of the described experiments , the loschmidt echo ( le )",
    "is defined as the revival that occurs when an imperfect time - reversal procedure is implemented @xcite .",
    "if the unperturbed evolution is given by a classically chaotic hamiltonian , there exists a regime in which the decay rate of the le corresponds to the classical lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "such a particular pid holds for a semiclassical initial state built from a dense spectrum and a perturbation above certain threshold . under weaker perturbations ,",
    "the le decay depends on their strength following a fermi golden rule ( fgr ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , the le semiclassical expansion showed that the pid regime results from the phase fluctuations along the unperturbed classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "this represents a first identification of _ irreversibility _ , as measured by the le , with _",
    "decoherence_.    in addressing an actual many - spin dynamics",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "on one side , there is no classical hamiltonian that serves as reference . on the other side , the numerical evaluation of the le in a weakly perturbed _",
    "finite _ spin system , could not justify the experimental observations patricia98 .",
    "since experiments involve almost _ infinitely _ large systems , one is left with the question of whether the mechanisms of le decay and system equilibration could eventually emerge from a progressive increase in the system size towards the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) . here , we tackle such a question by considering extensive calculations with @xmath3 and @xmath4 interacting spins , whose dynamics involve the complete 2@xmath5-dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "we adopt a model with all - to - all dipolar interactions which allows for small statistical fluctuations facilitating the analysis of the tl . as in the case of the polarization echo @xcite",
    ", our initial state is given by a local excitation in a single spin , and the detection is also a local measurement of the polarization mesoeco - prl1995,zangara2012,zangara2013prb .",
    "we will show that , in the presence of a small hamiltonian perturbation , the decay of the le follows a fgr , much as if the system were interacting with a continuum .",
    "this indicates that the system itself would indeed behave as its own environment .",
    "in addition , we observe that the excitation remains homogeneously distributed in spite of the time reversal . in other words ,",
    "the equilibration produced by the unperturbed hamiltonian becomes fully irreversible in the presence of an arbitrary small perturbation .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the mentioned fgr corresponds to a _ proliferation _ of two- and four - body effective interactions mediated by virtual processes .",
    "remarkably , we show that the realm of this description is wider as the system size increases .",
    "such an observation hints that , in the tl , the proliferation of effective interactions is the sought mechanism that rules irreversibility .",

    "<S> we address the question on how weak perturbations , that are quite ineffective in small many - body systems , can lead to decoherence and hence to irreversibility when they proliferate as the system size increases . </S>",
    "<S> this question is at the heart of solid state nmr . </S>",
    "<S> there , an initially local polarization spreads all over due to spin - spin interactions that conserve the total spin projection , leading to an equilibration of the polarization . in principle , this quantum dynamics can be reversed by changing the sign of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reversal is usually perturbed by non reversible interactions that act as a decoherence source . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of the local excitation recovered defines the loschmidt echo ( le ) , here evaluated in a series of closed @xmath0 spin systems with all - to - all interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable regime of the le decay occurs when the perturbation induces proliferated effective interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if this perturbation exceeds some lower bound , the decay is ruled by an effective fermi golden rule ( fgr ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a lower bound shrinks as @xmath1 increases , becoming the leading mechanism for le decay in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> once the polarization stayed equilibrated longer than the fgr time , it remains equilibrated in spite of the reversal procedure . </S>"
