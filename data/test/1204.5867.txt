    "the stability and structure of nuclei at the upper end of the nuclear chart is a hot topic in contemporary nuclear physics .",
    "it is a challenging task to answer which heavy nuclides may exist and what properties they may have . therefore strong efforts have been made in the experimental developments as well as in the theoretical description of super - heavy elements ( she s ) .    in the last decades",
    "a huge progress in the synthesis of new elements has been achieved in world leading laboratories like the gsi , darmstadt @xcite , jinr , dubna @xcite , and riken , tokyo @xcite .",
    "the first she s with @xmath2 and @xmath3 were produced in cold fusion reactions . in these experiments , involving neutron rich projectiles and spherical targets ( @xmath4pb or @xmath5bi ) ,",
    "weakly excited compound nuclei were produced which cooled down by the emission of only one or two neutrons .",
    "further experimental progress in the synthesis of the heaviest elements was achieved by hot fusion reactions in which targets of deformed actinide were bombarded with the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath6ca .",
    "the compound nucleus created in this way was more excited and three or more neutrons were emitted .",
    "these reactions succeeded in the synthesis of new elements up to @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the first observation of the element 117 was possible lately @xcite using a radioactive @xmath9bk target .",
    "new possibilities for the synthesis of new isotopes will be opened in heavy ion collisions with radioactive ion beams @xcite .",
    "nowadays , many other laboratories are involved in the exploration of she s .",
    "thus the experimental groups from berkeley @xcite , ganil @xcite , livermore @xcite , jyvskyl @xcite , and oak ridge @xcite are working in this direction .",
    "they would bring in the nearest future further information on the stability and properties of the she s and an independent verification of the existing data .    in a parallel way to the experimental efforts , the properties of the she s have been also investigated in various nuclear models .",
    "a proper description of trans - fermium nuclei is a great challenge for any theoretical model .",
    "usually , the parameters of the theories on atomic nuclei are adjusted to the stable isotopes and then extrapolated to the region of heavier systems . therefore many tries in different theoretical approaches",
    "are performed to foresee the stability and the structure of the heaviest nuclei .",
    "a detailed review of the theoretical analysis of she s can be found in ref .",
    "the first theoretical investigations on the stability of heavy nuclei were made in the 60 s .",
    "it was noticed that shell effects could stabilize nuclei heavier than those known at that time @xcite .",
    "calculations made in the macroscopic - microscopic model with strutinsky shell correction predicted the  island of stability \" .",
    "large values of shell energies were obtained at @xmath10 for prolate deformed nuclei and @xmath11 for spherical ones @xcite . in the last decades many calculations",
    "have been made providing more and more precise predictions .",
    "the fission barriers and the ground state properties were calculated using macroscopic - microscopic methods with large range of deformation parameters and nuclear shapes , including reflection and axial symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "self - consistent methods also provided many results on fission barriers and half - lives .",
    "important results have been obtained in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) @xcite , the hartree - fock ( hf ) approach with skyrme forces @xcite and the hartree fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with gogny forces @xcite .",
    "the first calculations of fission barriers were performed in the axial and reflection symmetric regime but later all relevant deformations were considered in the minimization of the energy .",
    "it is well known that the liquid drop model does not predict a fission barrier in the heaviest nuclei and that the stability of the trans - fermium nuclei is achieved by the shell effects .",
    "the self - consistent quantum mechanical methods ( rmf , hf and hfb ) as microscopic theories are the perfect tools for the analysis of she s .",
    "moreover , in the self - consistent calculations all possible shapes of a nucleus are considered in the minimization process .",
    "in contrast , the most of the macroscopic - microscopic models are restricted to some pre - defined classes of deformations and only  optimal shapes \" @xcite allow to obtain any configuration of a nucleus .",
    "therefore they are very suitable to describe large deformations of nuclei around the scission point .",
    "a degree of freedom which plays an important role along the fission path are the pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "since in the hfb theory the particle - hole and the particle - particle matrix elements are treated on the same footing , the proper consideration of pairing along the whole fission path is guaranteed .",
    "this method has been successfully applied in many aspects of low energy nuclear physics , in particular in the description of fission barriers of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "another theoretical quest was to discover a semi - empirical formula describing @xmath1 emission half - lives @xcite .",
    "these investigations are very important as @xmath1 radioactivity is the dominant decay channel in many she s .",
    "the purpose of this article is to perform a systematic study of she s with respect to their stability and ground state properties in the framework of the hfb theory with the density dependent finite range gogny force and the d1s parametrization . in our analysis",
    "we include the region of the well known fermium ( fm , @xmath12 ) and nobelium ( no , @xmath13 ) elements to compare our predictions with the available experimental data .",
    "we show results for the heavier even - even nuclei rutherfordium ( rf , @xmath14 ) , seaborgium ( sg , @xmath15 ) , hassium ( hs , @xmath16 ) , darmstadtium ( ds , @xmath17 ) and copernicium ( cn , @xmath18 , which was named two years ago @xcite ) .",
    "heavier elements with @xmath19 , without given name so far , are also considered .",
    "we limit our study to @xmath20 isotopes .",
    "these nuclei are nowadays in the main stream of interest of experiments with she s",
    ".    a large amount of information on nuclear structure and stability can be obtained from properties of the ground states of the she s .",
    "consequently , we start our investigation with the description of the ground state characteristics .",
    "deformations , pairing energies and two - nucleon separation energies are analyzed and collated with the single - particle energy level scheme .",
    "the ground state energies can be used to evaluate the @xmath21 values which are necessary to calculate the probability of @xmath1 emission - one of the dominant decay modes in she .",
    "a competing process to @xmath1 decay is the spontaneous fission . to analyze this mode",
    "we determine the fission barriers for all mentioned she s as a function of the quadrupole moment @xmath22 .",
    "the calculations were performed in an axial basis , although we are aware of the non - axial effects on the height of the barrier and we discuss them in a few selected cases .",
    "the impact of the octupole deformation on the potential energy along the fission path is crucial in the determination of fission barriers of she s .",
    "this is taken into account by allowing non - reflexion symmetrical shapes .",
    "the calculations were performed in a large deformed harmonic oscillator basis paying special attention to the proper optimization of the oscillator lengths and to the convergence of the calculations with the size of the basis .",
    "next , using the wkb approximation , we calculate the fission half - lives . finally , the comparison of the half - lives for @xmath1 decay and spontaneous fission allows to predict the stability of the heaviest nuclei .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations .",
    "the description of the ground - state properties of she s is shown in sec .",
    "iii , fission barriers in sec .",
    "half - lives of she s are discussed in sec .",
    "v. finally , sec .",
    "vi contains a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "in our research we will apply the self consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory with the finite range density dependent gogny force . in the numerical applications we use the d1s @xcite parameterization of the gogny interaction .",
    "the d1s parameters were adjusted @xcite to give a better surface energy term ( crucial for a proper description of the fission phenomenon ) .",
    "the choice of the gogny force with the d1s parameterization is based on the fact that whenever this interaction has been used to describe low energy nuclear structure phenomena an , at least , reasonable agreement with experiment has been obtained .",
    "this degree of agreement has been obtained both for calculations at the mean field level and beyond @xcite .      in the microscopic hfb calculations",
    "we have used the computer code presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite where special attention was paid to an accurate computation of the matrix elements of the gogny interaction for very large basis like the one used in this paper .",
    "the self - consistent equations have been solved by expanding the quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators on finite bases of axially symmetric deformed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) eigenfunctions .",
    "the size of the bases used depends upon two parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are related to the allowed range of the ho quantum numbers through the relation @xmath25 along the perpendicular direction we take @xmath23 shells , ( i.e. @xmath26 shells depending on the value of @xmath27 . in the present study we have used @xmath28 , a value which is suited for the elongated shapes along the @xmath29 direction typical of the fission process , and @xmath30 .",
    "other parameters characterizing the ho bases are the oscillator lengths @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these two quantities have been determined , for each calculated wave function , as to minimize the hfb energy . in order to study the different paths to fission , in our calculations",
    "we have used as constraints the axial quadrupole ( @xmath22 ) and octupole ( @xmath33 ) moments , with @xmath34 .",
    "higher multipolarities are adjusted in the self - consistent process to minimize the energy . to study the impact of triaxiality effects we have also carried out calculations for a few nuclei where the axial symmetry requirement was released but the left - right symmetry was imposed .    in the calculations",
    "the coulomb exchange energy has been treated in the slater approximation @xcite . additionally , the coulomb and the spin - orbit contributions to the pairing field have been neglected . finally , the two body kinetic energy correction ( 2b - kec ) is not included in the variation process because , for heavy nuclei , it remains almost constant for most of the physical configurations .",
    "as this term was included in the fitting of the force , we have to include its contribution at the end of the calculation in order to obtain reasonable binding energies .",
    "see also @xcite for a detailed discussion of the relevance of neglected or approximated terms in these calculations .",
    "we have also subtracted from the hfb energy the rotational energy corrections ( rec ) stemming from the restoration of the rotational symmetry .",
    "this correction has a considerable influence on the energy landscape ( and therefore on the height of the fission barriers ) as it is somehow proportional to the degree of symmetry breaking and therefore proportional to the quadrupole moment .",
    "a full calculation of the rec would imply an angular momentum projection @xcite which is only feasible for light nuclei . in order to estimate the rec we have followed the usual recipe @xcite of subtracting to the hfb energy the quantity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fluctuation associated with the angular momentum operators in the hfb wave function and @xmath37 is the yoccoz moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "this moment of inertia has been computed using the  cranking \" approximation in which the full linear response matrix appearing in its expression is replaced by the zero order approximation .",
    "the effect of the  cranking approximation \" in the yoccoz moment of inertia was analyzed with the gogny interaction for heavy nuclei in @xcite by comparing it with the one extracted from an angular momentum projected calculation ( see also @xcite for a comparison in light nuclei ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the exact rec is a factor 0.7 smaller than the one computed with the  cranking \" approximation to the yoccoz moment of inertia for strongly deformed configurations ( a similar behavior has been observed for the thouless - valatin moment of inertia in @xcite ) .",
    "we have taken this phenomenological factor into account in our calculation of the rec .",
    "the evaluation of the spontaneous fission half - life is carried out in the standard wkb framework where @xmath38 is given ( in seconds ) by @xcite @xmath39 in this expression @xmath40 is the action along the @xmath22 constrained path which is given by @xmath41 @xmath42 corresponds to the @xmath22 value of the ground state and @xmath43 the @xmath22 value where the potential energy equals the one of the ground state .",
    "for the collective quadrupole inertia @xmath44 we have used the adiabatic time dependent hfb ( atdhfb ) expression computed again in the  cranking \" approximation and given by @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the two - particle - zero - hole component of the quadrupole operator @xmath48 in the quasiparticle representation @xcite and @xmath49 are the quasiparticle energies obtained in the solution of the hfb equation .    in the expression for the action the collective potential @xmath50 is given by the hfb energy ( with the 2b - kec and rec corrections ) minus the zero point energy ( zpe ) correction @xmath51 associated with the quadrupole motion .",
    "this zpe correction is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 finally , in the expression for the action an additional parameter @xmath54 is introduced .",
    "this parameter can be taken as the hfb energy of the ( metastable ) ground state .",
    "however , it is argued that in a quantal treatment of the problem the ground state energy is given by the hfb energy plus the zero point energy associated to the collective motion . to account for this fact ,",
    "the usual recipe @xcite is to add an estimation of the zero point energy to the hfb energy in order to obtain @xmath54 . in our calculations",
    "we have taken a zero point energy of 0.5 mev for all the isotopes considered .    in some she s around @xmath8 a weakly oblate deformed ground state can be found .",
    "the fission path in these nuclei obviously does not go along axial symmetric shapes through the spherical configuration .",
    "such a nucleus rather takes triaxial shapes to reach the prolate saddle point with the similar absolute value of the quadrupole moment .",
    "as the energies on the triaxial part of the fission barrier are very small in comparison with the saddle point @xcite they will contribute insignificantly to the action integral .",
    "therefore we will neglect them in the calculation of half - lives .    to calculate the @xmath1-decay half - lives we use the phenomenological formula of viola and seaborg @xcite @xmath55 = ( az+b)(q_{\\alpha})^{-1/2 } + ( cz + d ) -7.5\\ ] ] with @xmath56 the atomic number of the parent nucleus .",
    "the @xmath57-factor of the decay , @xmath58 , is obtained from the calculated ground state binding energies with the experimental value @xmath59 mev @xcite @xmath60 the constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ta ] ) are : @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : all_nuclide ] we present an overview of all the nuclei covered in the present work .",
    "the chosen region ranges from the heaviest trans - actinides , well known from numerous experiments , up to beyond the neutron magic shell number @xmath63 predicted by many theoretical models .",
    "the upper limit is provided by the vanishing of the two - proton separation energy .",
    "the latter approximates the proton drip line which is determined by the one - proton separation energy with some correction due to the influence of the centrifugal barrier @xcite .",
    "the region of neutron rich isotopes beyond the @xmath64-stability line ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_nuclide ] by black squares ) has been omitted as it is out of reach for the current experimental methods and can not be produced in heavy ion collisions . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_nuclide ] the experimentally known she s are located in the center of the investigated region . since we consider the ground state properties as specially relevant for the understanding of the underlying physics we present these properties in the first subsection while the following subsection is entirely devoted to the study of the fission barriers .",
    "the theoretical approach discussed in the previous section has been applied to perform a systematic study of the properties of 160 super - heavy nuclei in the region @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "earlier calculations in this region have been performed in the microscopic - macroscopic approach @xcite , in the hf plus bcs with the skyrme force in the p - h channel and a monopole pairing force in the p - p channel @xcite and in the full hfb approach by @xcite with the gogny force .",
    "the calculations by berger et al .",
    "are rather similar to ours in the basic aspects .",
    "however , in our work the configuration space is larger , more appropriate for fission , and we allow more general hfb wave functions ( with more simultaneously broken symmetries ) . furthermore our study is rather detailed and systematic .          to gain insight into the relevant physics of the she s we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : spe ] the single particles energies ( s.p.e . ) for the nucleus @xmath67hs in reflection symmetric configurations as a function of the quadrupole deformation @xmath68 and the quadrupole moment @xmath22 .",
    "we have chosen this nucleus as a representative of the whole region for the following reasons . since it is in the center of the area of the calculated nuclei its s.p.e .",
    "spectrum is characteristic for all she s , furthermore its proton and neutron pairing energies are small and the extraction of the s.p.e . from the hfb calculations is more reliable .",
    "the s.p.e .",
    "are obtained as usual : after solving the hfb equations the one - body hf hamiltonian is diagonalized in that basis . for the neutron system",
    "we find large spherical gaps at neutron numbers 164 , 184 and 228 ; prolate gaps at 162 and oblate gaps at 172 and 178 . in nuclei with neutron number close to 160 the spherical minimum at 164",
    "is overwhelmed by the prolate one at 162 .",
    "for protons there are several gaps .",
    "the more relevant are the spherical ones for @xmath56 values 92 , 114 and 126 , the spherical - oblate one at 120 and the prolate ones at 104 and 108 .",
    "as we will see below many nuclear properties can be understood just by looking at these s.p.e.s .",
    "let s now discuss some ground state properties starting with the deformation parameters @xmath69 . since most of the studies on these parameters have been done in the macroscopic - microscopic models we will use a definition of the @xmath69 s in the spirit of these models .",

    "[ fig : beta]a .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath68 barely depends on the proton number z and decreases slowly with increasing neutron number . for all z values the nuclei with @xmath73",

    "fig : fb106 - 110 ] ) . at the same time",
    "the absolute value of the quadrupole deformation parameter of the ground state decreases from @xmath78 for @xmath79 to @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "the barrier between the two wells diminishes and finally disappears at @xmath63 , where the nuclei become spherical .",

    "s our @xmath68 are somewhat larger but this may be connected to the slightly different methods of computation of the deformation parameters @xmath69 . in the presence of coexisting minima , one must be aware that when the restriction to axially symmetric shapes is released one of the two minima may not be a true minimum , but rather a saddle point @xcite . a clear example is the case of the heavier ds isotopes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fb106 - 110 ] one observes two minima ( prolate and oblate ) around @xmath83 b , but looking at triaxial calculations one finds that the prolate minimum is a saddle point .",
    "the gross behavior of the deformation parameter can be qualitatively understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : spe ] .",

    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 neutron shell effects favor smaller prolate deformations while in the proton system small prolate as well as spherical shapes are favored .",
    "around @xmath79 the oblate shapes are favored while larger n values prefer smaller oblaticity .",

    "the drop is very steep for the lighter elements ( rf , sg , hs ) and gentler for the heavier ones ( ds , cn ) , whereas for the isotopes of @xmath89 almost no change is observed .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the decreasing potential energy along almost the whole barrier , associated with a diminishing of the saddle point energy and the clear development of the second minimum ( figs .",

    "the half - lives calculated for @xmath211 along the nrs path diminish more rapidly with the increase on @xmath97 than in the rs mode .",

    "[ fig : fb106 - 110 ] , [ fig : fb112 - 116 ] . in nuclei with @xmath212 the nrs fission barrier allows to avoid the second hump of the rs barrier making the asymmetric fission the most probable mode .",
    "very short fission half - lives , even below @xmath213 ms , can be found in the hs , ds , cn and @xmath89 isotopes , where the nrs fission is the dominant decay mode being even faster than the @xmath1 emission . in @xmath89",

    "this effect is governed by two trends observed in the evolution of the pes s .",
    "the first one is the aforementioned growth of the first hump of the barrier which is the highest one in almost all nuclei with @xmath215 .",

    "the nrs barriers extend up to relatively large values of the quadrupole moment . therefore their transition probabilities are smaller than in the rs mode .",
    "this fact together with the long @xmath1 decay half - lifes implies that in this region one can find isotopes with very long half - lives .",
    "the rs fission is the dominant decay mode .",
    "however these very neutron rich hs isotopes are extremely difficult to synthesize using contemporary experimental techniques .",
    "the saddle point of the first hump of the barrier takes its maximal energy value at @xmath81 .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath219 isotones decay a few orders of magnitude faster than the neighboring nuclei with @xmath112 and @xmath81 .",

    "this indicates a magic number at @xmath63 . nevertheless , this feature does not have a big impact on the fission half - lives and the region of the most stable nuclei",

    "@xmath81 the @xmath1 decay half - lives also reach their maxima although they are less pronounced than for the fission half - lives .",

    "the extremely long fission half - lives for the @xmath112 and @xmath81 isotopes are larger than the @xmath1 decay half - lives in cn and @xmath89 whereas for @xmath219 nrs fission is the dominant mode .",
    "the isotopes with neutron number larger than the magic @xmath63 are characterized by a rapid decrease of the fission half - lives with increasing neutron number .",
    "this is a consequence of the decrease of energy along the whole energy barrier .",
    "the second minimum goes down below the ground state and the height of the first barrier reduces substantially when heavier nuclei are considered .",
    "these strong trends can not be balanced by the few mev decrease of the ground state energy due to the octupole deformation .",

    "the @xmath1 decay half - lives do not vary strongly along the isotopic chain in this region .",
    "the fluctuations are associated with the changes of the ground state deformations of the parent and the daughter nuclei . in this region",
    "the decrease of the @xmath1 decay half - lives with the proton number is also visible .",
    "most isotopes in this region can not be synthesized due to the very short fission ( in the proton deficient nuclei ) or @xmath1 emission ( in the proton rich isotones ) half - lives .",

    "it is easy to distinguish the regions where each decay mode plays the most important role .",

    "the half - lives of these isotopes are also longer than @xmath232 s. very long half - lives characterize also the hs isotopes decaying through the rs fission .",
    "in this work the hatree - fock - bogoliubov theory with large basis size and the density dependent gogny force as interaction have been used to study the most relevant properties of 160 heavy and super - heavy elements as well as their predominant decay modes . in order to keep the calculations as general as possible we allow for wave functions with different symmetries , namely axially symmetric and reflexion symmetric , axially symmetric and non reflexion symmetric and",
    "lastly triaxial wave functions . after a thorough analysis along different fission paths and considering that our calculations are extremely cpu time demanding due to the large basis to study 160 nuclei we perform most calculations in the axially symmetric approaches .    the ground state deformations @xmath233 and @xmath102 as well as @xmath21 factors , pairing properties and the two neutron and two proton separation energies are thoroughly discussed .",

    "properties like mass parameters , pairing features and the variation of the action among others are calculated along the fission path with wave functions of the three types mentioned above .",
    "we find that though the shape of the fission barrier has a large impact on the fission half - lives , the mass parameter also plays an important role .",
    "in such a way that wave functions with larger barriers and smaller mass parameter may tunnel easier than alternative ones with smaller barriers and larger mass . since in general axially symmetric wave functions do have smaller masses than the triaxial ones , the restriction to axial symmetry is a good option to perform a systematic study of the half - lives of she . in the second part of the paper a thorough study of the shapes of the barriers in the as - rs and as - nrs",
    "is performed .",
    "a reasonable explanation of heights and shapes as well as of octupole effects is obtained on the basis of the single particle energy levels .",
    "the two dimensional ( @xmath234 ) energy contour plots for the nuclei @xmath130hs and @xmath132cn allow to disentangle the different fission paths and its possible interconnections .    in the third part of the paper",
    "the half - lives of all studied nuclei are calculated for the different decay modes , namely @xmath1-decay and along the different fission paths .",
    "we find clear tendencies with the neutron number easily explainable on the basis of the behavior of @xmath21 factors and barrier shapes , respectively .",
    "in particular , we find that the @xmath1 emission is the predominant decay mode , specially in the proton rich region . concerning the spontaneous fission we obtain that the rs mode is dominant for the proton deficient nuclei in medium mass she s with @xmath222 for @xmath223 , @xmath224 for @xmath157 , and in the region of the heaviest she s with @xmath225 for @xmath226 .",
