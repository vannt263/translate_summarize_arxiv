    "charged interfaces , from their microscopic origin to their macroscopic statistical properties , appear naturally in the study of doped correlated insulators . the latter are characterized by discrete symmetry broken phases with @xmath4-fold degenerate ground states , @xmath5 .",
    "the interfaces , which are topological configurations whether charged or not , provide a connection between the different ground states . in this framework , quasi - one - dimensional systems , e.g. systems of weakly bound chains , exhibit them at a microscopic level via solitons which emerge as single particles , the @xmath6particles @xcite .",
    "this name is related to the fact that each particle provides a phase jump @xmath7 , connecting two different but equivalent ground states , within a chain .",
    "their presence therefore breaks the coherence between neighboring chains which must have the same phase modulo @xmath8 .",
    "actually they may exist in a broader range of materials even though their individual detection might be difficult . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath9 defects , i.e. @xmath1 , may be interpreted as the building blocks of the experimentally observed stripes in manganite @xcite and cuprate @xcite oxides as well as of the domain walls observed in uniaxial ferroelectric systems @xcite .",
    "the latter references , @xcite and @xcite , should also provide informations about the charge carried by kinks via measurements of the tilt angle of the stripes and the dipole momentum , respectively .    in one dimension ( @xmath10 ) or above the transition temperature ,",
    "uncharged @xmath6particles are allowed to exist as a gas of elementary excitations .",
    "they can be defined as strings of reversed spins which , in @xmath11 , cost an energy proportional to their length because of interchain coupling . below the transition temperature @xmath12 , in the ordered broken symmetry phase",
    ", a single soliton would cost infinite energy .",
    "the condition for their preservation lies in the concept of _ confinement _",
    "@xcite , which limits the string s length leading to finite energy excitations .",
    "@xmath12 is thus called the confinement - deconfinement transition temperature .",
    "below @xmath12 , a constant force is originated by confinement which binds the kinks into trains of @xmath4 particles , to recover the total increment of @xmath8 , within each chain .",
    "going to zero temperature , confinement leads to the aggregation of the trains of solitons belonging to different chains .",
    "thus , the microscopic defects become mesoscopic complexes which span the whole sample at @xmath13 and can be viewed as domain lines or walls whether the system is , respectively , @xmath14 or @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these qualitative arguments strictly apply when solitons are uncharged and must be extended to the case where long ranged coulomb interactions are present . indeed , doping correlated insulators",

    "also , field effect experiments @xcite provide junctions of mobile charged kinks interacting with their images .",
    "the present work deals exclusively with a @xmath16-fold degenerate ground state which corresponds , for quasi - one - dimensional systems , to the well known case of polyacetylene , cf .",

    "both amplitude - solitons have the same electric charge .",
    "the anti - kink of opposite charge , corresponding to the @xmath9 to @xmath19 shift , is not thermally activated . for the sake of clarity we thus attribute to the @xmath21-soliton the same graphical representation as the former in fig .",

    "the trains of kinks are then simply pairs of kink@xmath20anti - kinks or `` bikinks '' and the domain lines perpendicular to the chains are formed by such bikinks .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapter [ prent ]",
    "we present the general model of confinement based on the mapping of a system of interacting kinks to the anisotropic ising model . in chapter [ firstest ]",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath14 system , with competing coulomb interactions and interchain coupling , is given .",
    "analytically , the results are obtained by various estimates in the case of strong correlations and with the help of a phenomenological model , equivalent to the ising model below @xmath12 , which has been extended to include weak coulomb interactions .",

    "various regimes of the estimated phase diagram are discussed .",
    "the impact of discreteness imposed by numerical simulations is also considered .",
    "details of calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "we shall follow the method of @xcite , where the statistics of uncharged kinks in a system of weakly bound chains was studied by _ mapping to the ising model_.    the original hamiltonian describing the kinks reads    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the total number of kinks , @xmath24 is the energy of an isolated kink , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively , their chemical potential and local concentration .",

    "the mapping to the two - dimensional ising model , whose @xmath35 symmetry is clearly compatible with the @xmath2fold degeneracy of our system , is then based on a coarse graining procedure by introducing a new length scale @xmath36 , which corresponds to the optimal width of a pair of kinks within a chain under the combined action of interchain interaction and exponential intrachain repulsion between them , cf .",

    "the bikink increases linearly with its size . as a consequence ,",
    "a constant confinement force binds the solitons .",
    "exponential core repulsion prevents them from annihilating .",
    "without coulomb interaction , the ising model mapping allows for a complete analysis of the @xmath14 case .",
    "the aggregation of kinks is controlled by the temperature or the reduced temperature used in the phase diagram , @xmath62 if their density is weak enough , which we will suppose in the following , below the confinement transition temperature @xmath63 the growing confinement energy binds the kinks in pairs with remaining energy @xmath64 .",
    "when the bikinks on neighboring chains stick together below the crossover temperature , @xmath65 the energy @xmath64 is released which results in an adhesion process leading to growing rods .",
    "the latter are double lines formed by aggregated bikinks , perpendicular to the chains .",
    "their growth when temperature is further decreased can be seen from the density of solitons and the average rod length @xmath66 @xmath67 these expressions , obtained from the exact solution of the non - interacting ising model @xcite show that as @xmath68 the length of the aggregates grows exponentially with temperature until they cross the whole sample more like a system of free domain lines .    on the other hand ,",
    "the strength of the coulomb interaction can be characterized by    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the unit area of the coarse grained lattice and @xmath71 takes into account possible fractional charges @xcite which may be measured in ferroelectric experiments @xcite .",
    "parameters @xmath64and @xmath72 give , respectively , the scale of the confinement energy and of the coulomb energy perpendicular to the chains .",
    "they are invariant under coarse graining , thus @xmath73 is also invariant . unless @xmath54 is very large the @xmath72 scale is larger than other ones . for example , it is much larger than the energy per particle of a wigner crystal , which is of the order of @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mean distance between particles of the wigner crystal .",
    "it is also important with respect to the confinement . in rydbergs , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is bohr s radius",

    "@xmath79 if we choose @xmath80 . thus for @xmath81 and @xmath82 we have @xmath83 taking @xmath84 , the dielectric constant needs to be of the order of @xmath85 for the confinement energy to be of the order of the coulomb energy .",
    "this is large but may not be excluded for @xmath86 , where the plasma frequency @xmath87 ev and the gap @xmath88 ev .    at low temperatures @xmath73 controls the aggregation of the defects in a way similar to @xmath89 at high temperatures",
    "this follows from the derivation of the optimal width @xmath90 of a bikink under the combined action of coulomb force @xmath91 and the confinement force @xmath92 : @xmath93 this relation holds in all bikink phases whether they are liquid or of the wigner crystal type . in both phases the average distance between bikinks is given by @xmath94 .",
    "as long as @xmath95 the elongation @xmath90 can be neglected so that , in zero approximation , the bikink can be considered as a well defined particle of charge @xmath96 . on the other hand when @xmath90 is of the order of @xmath97 , bikinks deconfine and",
    "the system consists of interacting solitons .",
    "these remarks are weakly modified at non zero temperature as long as @xmath98 .",
    "this follows from the fact that thermal fluctuations shift the mean width of the bikink to @xmath99 .",
    "thermal fluctuations can be neglected as soon as @xmath100 . unless @xmath54 is large , cf .",
    "( [ gammanumerical ] ) , this condition is well satisfied below @xmath101 .",
    "below @xmath101 , when the condition @xmath100 is satisfied , bikinks order in the form of a wigner crystal .",
    "the ratio @xmath102 is another control parameter which defines a crossover to a deconfined phase consisting of a wigner crystal of solitons .",
    "the lindeman criterion specifies that the crossover occurs when the mean square deviation of the width @xmath90 becomes of the order of a fraction of @xmath97 . with the small lindeman number @xmath103 the transition is thus expected at @xmath104    which scales as @xmath105 .",
    "this deconfinement transition with respect to the bikinks can be easily derived from the wigner crystal phase of solitons .",
    "the energy per particle of the wigner crystal of solitons is @xmath106 and the confinement energy @xmath107 .",
    "a confinement crossover , with respect to the solitons , takes place when both energies are of the same order . taking into account the lindeman number , we recover ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "these results are summarized in the phase diagram of figure [ fig2.phd ] .",
    "the coulomb interactions are expected to be especially important for aggregated phases , e.g. rods and lines , because of the size - dependent charging energy cost of the aggregation , @xmath108 where @xmath42 is the number of solitons belonging to each of the two lines formed by the rods and @xmath109 is the debye screening length .",
    "the latter is determined by the density response function @xmath110 which , for the @xmath14 plane embedded in @xmath15 space , is @xmath111    we shall consider the case of relatively weak coulomb interactions which does not prevent the actual existence of the aggregates while affecting their statistical properties .",
    "the required condition is that @xmath112 .",
    "our aim is then to formulate the general expressions which yield the density of kinks and their mean length .",
    "this can be done with the help of a phenomenological model which has been shown to adequately reproduce the results of the exact solution @xcite .",
    "the rods can fuse into longer ones or disintegrate into shorter ones , equilibrating their chemical potentials .",
    "the main effect of the coulomb interaction is to shift the energy @xmath113 of each aggregate of length @xmath114 by its self - energy ( [ sigma ] ) while preserving their shapes .",
    "the free energy of the system is then @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the density of rods of length @xmath114 , the second term is the entropy of the boltzmann - like rod gas , and @xmath117    is the energy of a rod of length @xmath114 .",
    "the first term in ( [ energy ] ) corresponds to the confinement energy paid by the tips of the rod . in the second term we have taken into account the fact that there are two kinks per unit length of the aggregate .    minimizing the free - energy with the constraint that the total number of particles is constant , @xmath118    the density of kinks is then given by @xmath119 where @xmath50 is related to the chemical potential of the solitons @xmath25 by ( [ isingparam ] ) .",
    "thus , expression ( [ mu / n ] ) allows one to fix @xmath25 .",
    "finally , the average length of the domain line reads @xmath120 from ( [ mu / n ] ) and ( [ l * ] ) with @xmath121 we recover the results in ( [ v02 ] ) . as will be shown in subsequent paragraphs , screening by normal carriers , cf .",
    "@xmath109 , is important in the present regime .",
    "self - screening in the ensemble of solitons is also considered .",
    "it plays a dominant role at @xmath13 , especially for stronger coulomb interactions corresponding to @xmath122 .",
    "the efficiency of the bulk screening is manifested by the fact that the debye length @xmath109 is shorter than the average length of the domain line @xmath66 . considering a distribution of rods with lengths",
    "@xmath123 , we arrive , with the help of ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ mu / n ] ) , at the expressions given in ( [ v02 ] ) with @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the effective chemical potential shifted by the coulomb self - energy",
    ". we can now check our original hypothesis @xmath126 .",
    "we have with the help of ( [ ld ] ) @xmath127 thus    @xmath128    which grows as @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , thanks to the presence of an effective bulk screening , the interacting system can be mapped to the non - interacting one , in the limit @xmath130 , proving the growing macroscopic aggregation of the defects .",
    "more surprising is the case of _ weak _ screening which corresponds to @xmath131 . considering",
    "a distribution of rods with lengths @xmath132 , ( [ mu / n ] ) then becomes @xmath133    where the second term in the exponent comes from the self - energy of a rod of length @xmath42 . due to the non - linearity of the self - energy the chemical potential can not simply be shifted as in the previous case .",
    "moreover , the coulomb energy makes the sum converge even for a zero value of the chemical potential . in order to balance the coulomb interaction and",
    "thus keep a given non - zero @xmath55 , we must allow @xmath50 to acquire negative values in ( [ nnonscreen ] ) .",
    "to show this , we notice that the integral in ( [ nnonscreen ] ) can be evaluated with the help of a saddle point approximation , which is valid for large , negative @xmath50 . at the saddle point",
    "the argument of the exponential in ( [ nnonscreen ] ) has a sharp maximum for    @xmath134 and ( [ nnonscreen ] ) becomes @xmath135 from ( [ ld ] ) and ( [ nnonscreen ] ) at the saddle point , the debye length reads @xmath136 as we work at constant @xmath55 , @xmath137 is given by ( [ vsp ] )    @xmath138 due to the weak coulomb interaction @xmath112 and the sharpness of the saddle point ensured by @xmath139 , the second term in ( [ lspsps ] ) is a correction with respect to the first .",
    "the second term is responsible for the increase of @xmath137 with decreasing temperature as long as @xmath140 hence , in this regime , @xmath141 and ( [ lspld ] ) yields @xmath142 when @xmath137 reaches @xmath109 a crossover from the actual process of growth , involving negative @xmath50 , to the previous one will take place at @xmath143 defined , with the help of ( [ ls / ld ] ) , by @xmath144 where ( [ tetac ] ) has been used . from ( [ tl ] ) and ( [ tcr ] ) we have @xmath145    where we have also used the fact that we are in the weak coulomb regime .",
    "thus ( [ tcr / tl ] ) indicates that the well screened regime ( @xmath146 ) is reached before temperature is low enough to disfavor the growth of the rods , i.e. ( [ tl ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we summarize the case of weak screening as follows .    without coulomb interactions ,",
    "the rods started to form at @xmath147 and then grew exponentially with an activation energy @xmath148 ; as temperature approached zero , the chemical potential approached zero exponentially , cf .",
    "( [ v02 ] ) .    in the case of weak coulomb interaction ( @xmath149 ) , at low temperatures ( @xmath150 ) the behavior of the system is very different .",
    "remarkably , negative @xmath50 corresponds to the ising model with antiferromagnetic coupling along the chains .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath151spin coulomb interactions ( [ hc ] ) keep the system in the ferromagnetic state so as to preserve electroneutrality .",
    "the average length of the aggregates @xmath137 is approximately @xmath152 with weak deviations linear in temperature up to some logarithmic corrections , cf .",
    "( [ lspsps ] ) .",
    "these deviations lead to an increase of @xmath137 when @xmath153 decreases .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath154 moves down within the negative regime but logarithmically slow as can be seen from ( [ lsp ] ) .",
    "meanwhile the compressibility @xmath155 increases so that the screening length decreases linearly with temperature , cf .",
    "( [ lspld ] ) . at @xmath143",
    "the coulomb interaction becomes screened .",
    "the system then returns to the exponential growth of @xmath66 as for the noninteracting system .",
    "to finish with this section we mention that the logarithmically growing self - energy is peculiar to a doped system . in the case of a layer produced by a field effect experiment , dipoles order in lines of length @xmath156 and the associated energy is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the distance between a charge and its image . as we are interested in large @xmath42 , this energy becomes linear in @xmath42 .",
    "thus this case is similar to the well screened case .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations on the aggregates of the non - interacting system can be derived from the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model which is well known in the field of random interfaces , cf .",
    "@xcite for more details . in this model",
    "a line made of one topological charge , i.e. a domain line , is described by integer - valued height variables @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) which define the position of kinks along the chains with respect to their @xmath13 position .",
    "the energy of an sos interface at @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath161 and @xmath162 , can then be taken as @xcite @xmath163 the difference correlation function is then @xcite @xmath164 expression ( [ soscorrf ] ) shows that the correlation function diverges in the limit @xmath165 .",
    "this is a signature of the _ roughening _ of the domain line at any non zero temperature .",
    "this roughening leads to collisions between different lines separated by a distance @xmath166 . taking into account the fluctuations of one line , neighboring lines remaining straight for simplicity",
    ", a collision takes place once the mean fluctuation in @xmath167direction is of the order of @xmath166 .",
    "collisions of lines can be equivalently interpreted as disintegration of rods as can be seen from ( [ soscorrf ] ) . with @xmath168 , the temperature at which rods of length @xmath169 are formed",
    "is given by @xmath170 equation ( [ t ] ) shows that rods reduce to bikinks ( @xmath171 ) when @xmath172 in agreement with what has been said in the preceding paragraphs .",
    "in previous sections we have shown that the growing of the aggregates as we approach zero temperature is mainly due to an effective bulk screening . however , at @xmath13 all kinks have aggregated into domain lines which cross the whole sample . thus , no screening charge remains and no confinement energy , due to interchain interactions , is paid by the lines .",
    "the latter implies that two domain lines , each made of one type of topological charge , will be far apart . on the other hand , because there is no more screening charge , the competition between coulomb interaction and confinement leads to _ roughened lines , _ as shown below__. _ _ it is a signature of the _ self - screening _ of the domain lines .",
    "this roughening may be considered separately from the thermal roughening we discussed previously .",
    "first , we give some simple estimates concerning the form of the line .",
    "the latter corresponds to a linear distribution of charges and it s equilibrium shape is determined by allowing one of it s constituent kinks to find it s equilibrium position under the combined action of the coulomb repulsion and the attractive confinement force .",
    "the coulomb force @xmath173 originates from the infinite line and is balanced by the confinement force @xmath174 .",
    "the optimal equilibrium position of a kink emitted from the line is @xmath175    for @xmath122 , the linear distribution acquires a width @xmath176 .",
    "this finite width is a manifestation of the self - screening of the rods which leads to their roughening .    a particular distribution of kinks _",
    "within _ the roughened domain line requires a more elaborate analysis .",
    "we consider a general distribution characterized by the variational parameters @xmath177 and @xmath178 . the latter correspond to the periodicity of the distribution while the former is the modulation amplitude .",
    "they are found by minimizing the total energy per chain , @xmath179 , of the distribution .",
    "the latter is    @xmath180    with the coulomb energy per chain @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the size of the system in the @xmath183 direction .",
    "the confinement energy per chain is    @xmath184    in the case @xmath185 , ( [ ecoul<<res ] ) in the appendix and ( [ totalenergy ] ) yield in the main logarithmic approximation @xmath186 we clearly see from the last expression that the energy is not bounded from below for @xmath187 .",
    "the starting hypothesis @xmath185 is thus not satisfied . in the second case @xmath188 . with the help of ( [ ecoul>>res ] ) in the appendix , the total energy per chain is @xmath189 minimizing with respect to @xmath177 and @xmath178 leads to @xmath187 , again in contradiction with the starting hypothesis @xmath188 .",
    "these contradictions imply that the modulated line minimizes its energy at intermediate values of @xmath190 , e.g. @xmath191 , where the coulomb energy is of the order of the confinement energy . in this regime , ( [ totalenergy ] ) is difficult to treat analytically .",
    "we thus consider an ansatz giving the distribution of the kinks .",
    "numerical simulations give zig - zag shapes . in this connexion",
    "we show in the appendix that a sinusoidal profile @xmath192 gives a correct description of the distribution in the continuum limit .",

    "this results in an effective electrostatic interaction which is periodic in the computational cell used and which can be properly tabularized for rapid evaluations @xcite . at the beginning of each simulation",
    "we place the kinks at random and assign the sign to all of the ising variables @xmath41 accordingly .",
    "we study the energy landscape of the system using the classical monte carlo technique with the standard metropolis algorithm for the acceptance of kink motion . in order to rapidly reach configurations with the lowest energy ,",

    "the value assigned to the coarse graining length needs some more care .",
    "it must be at least of the order of the core of a soliton ( @xmath215 in polyacetylene ) .",
    "however , if it is too large the ground state of the system may be unreachable because of commensurability effects due to the discreteness of the lattice .",
    "the latter are especially relevant in the wigner crystal phases where a pinning by the lattice occurs which distorts the wigner crystal from its equilibrium position .",
    "we shall therefore estimate the upper boundary , allowing neglect of such commensurability effects , which can be reached by @xmath216 .",
    "we suppose that kinks form a wigner crystal with their positions @xmath217 in equilibrium , i.e. at the lowest energy distribution which is the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "this structure melts when the fluctuations @xmath218 of the kinks around their equilibrium position is a fraction @xmath103 , the lindeman number , of their mean separation @xmath219 .",
    "the new positions are @xmath220 , with @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "usually the melting is due to thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , if the coarse graining imposed by simulations is greater than @xmath218 , kinks will also never reach their equilibrium position and the wigner crystal will not be observed .",
    "instead a two - dimensional commensurate phase will form .",
    "thus , the coarse grained length must satisfy the condition @xmath223 . with the typical values given above this",

    "we have considered the effect of two competing long range interactions , coulomb and confinement , on the thermodynamic properties of systems with two - fold degenerate ground - states .",
    "analytical and numerical methods have been used and compared .",
    "the theory has been developed along the lines of the non - interacting case where a mapping to the ising model allowed for an exact solution in @xmath14 . due to the complications brought by the coulomb interactions , we have studied , in a semi - phenomenological way , the main features which distinguish the present case from the non - interacting one . in @xmath14 the main parameter controlling the aggregation of solitons in the presence of the long range interactions is @xmath73 in equation ( [ gamma ] ) , i.e. the ratio between the coulomb energy scale and the confinement scale .",
    "this parameter , below the crossover temperature @xmath101 , cf .",

    "[ fig2.phd ] depending on @xmath73 and temperature .",
    "we have concentrated on the low temperature regime , i.e. below @xmath101 , where we have shown that a crossover line @xmath235 separates a confined phase of bikinks and their aggregates from a deconfined phase which is a wigner crystal of solitons . as expected , in the aggregated phases , e.g. rods and lines , the coulomb interactions may play a crucial role because of the size dependent charging energy of the solitonic complexes . in the case of weak coulomb interactions @xmath112 , the efficiency of the bulk screening insures the preservation of the aggregates .",
    "the main effect of the long range interactions is to shift the chemical potential of the elementary defects by the coulomb self - energy ( [ kpara * ] ) .",
    "however , when bulk screening is no longer efficient , we have found that antiferromagnetic interactions along the chains are necessary in order for the system to adjust the correct density of solitons and conserve the aggregates ( [ nnonscreen ] ) .",
    "the ground state of the system remains ferromagnetic to maintain the electroneutrality . in both cases , efficient and weak screening",
    ", a growing macroscopic aggregation takes place .",
    "because of thermal roughening , only at @xmath13 do the complexes of solitons span the whole sample in the form of domain lines ( [ soscorrf ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the latter are stable for larger coulomb interactions @xmath236 due to self - screening in the ensemble of solitons .",
    "this is manifested by the coulomb roughening of the lines in accordance with numerical results , cf .",
    "[ zigzag ] .",
    "the parameters of the distribution were derived from a variational procedure ( [ param ] ) . in the continuum limit",
    "a sinusoidal profile gives a correct description of the rough lines .",
    "[ distrofsolitons ] we consider the periodic modulation for a general distribution of kinks @xmath237 .",
    "the coulomb potential energy associated with this distribution is given by ( [ poten ] ) .",
    "going to the new variables @xmath238 and @xmath239 expression ( [ poten ] ) becomes @xmath240 the integral has been regularized by subtracting the infinite contribution coming from the straight line @xmath241 .    in the case",

    "the first @xmath195integral , in ( [ ecoul > > ] ) , is over @xmath249 periods .",
    "its major contribution is at the vicinity of the zeros of @xmath250 .",
    "these zeros exist for any @xmath245 and correspond to `` nesting '' points @xmath251 with @xmath252 . from these considerations and with the help of @xmath253 , the major contribution to",
    "the integral reads @xmath254 where @xmath190 and we have taken @xmath255 . thus , restricting ourselves to the main logarithmic approximation , we obtain @xmath256 in the second @xmath195integral @xmath244 is large and we can expand the denominator in @xmath250 . going to the first order in @xmath257 the result is compensated by the regularizing term and thus gives zero .      the total energy of the system we are considering includes the potential energy and the confinement energy .",
    "the latter can be taken , for any @xmath177 , as @xmath259 combining ( [ econf ] ) with either ( [ ecoul<<res ] ) or ( [ ecoul>>res ] ) the total energy per chain is thus given by ( [ totalenergy ] ) .",
    "a particular function @xmath237 describing a single domain line in the two - dimensional plane at @xmath13 can be estimated .",
    "as implicitly assumed in ( [ econf ] ) , the confinement of this aggregate can be taken into account , in the hamiltonian , with the help of a solid on solid model : @xmath260 minimizing ( [ hinitial ] ) with respect to @xmath237 yields the recurrence relation @xmath261 ^{-3/2}}{\\sum _ { y'}\\left [ \\left ( x(y)-x(y')\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( y - y'\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] ^{-3/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath262 is the sign function and @xmath263 , has a unit of inverse length squared and is related to ( [ xopt/2dcoul ] ) .",
    "the solution @xmath237 can not easily be found analytically .",

    "this suggests using a sinusoidal ansatz @xmath264 comparing the resulting plot of each side of ( [ recurrencex(y ) ] ) we can check the accuracy of this approximation .",
