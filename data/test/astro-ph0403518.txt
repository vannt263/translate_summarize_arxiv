    "nowadays gamma - ray astronomy has become a very promising field of astronomy .",
    "however the mev region of gamma rays is still uncultivated , although this region would surely show us new aspects of high energy phenomena in the universe .",
    "in fact , comptel in compton gamma - ray observatory had observed for 9 years , and found about 30 celestial objects emitting mev gamma rays@xcite .",
    "however , taking into account of more than two hundreds discoveries of gev gamma - ray emitters by egret , it is expected that more than a hundred celestial objects would be detected in the mev region .",
    "this is almost due to the nonexistence of a reliable imaging method of mev gamma rays scattered via compton process in the matter .",
    "recently multi - compton telescopes have eagerly been studied as a next generation of the detector launched in satellites@xcite . here",
    "we propose a new imaging detector of mev gamma rays measuring both the directions and energies of not only a scattered gamma ray but also a recoil electron , which enables us to reconstruct the direction of an incident gamma ray event by event .",
    "figure [ comp ] shows the schematic view of the planned detector based on this concept for a balloon - borne experiment , which consists of a 30 cm cubic @xmath0-tpc surrounded by a scintillation pixel detector .",
    "also it is pointed out that one of two measured angles of a recoil electron gives us an additional redundancy which enables us to reject almost all the background events by the kinematic constraint .",
    "classical compton telescopes measure the energies of both the scattered gamma ray and recoil electron , and one direction of the scattered gamma ray .",
    "since this method losses the direction of the recoil electron , only one angle ( @xmath1 ) of the incident gamma ray can be determined .",
    "furthermore there remains no redundancy to reject the background . in the mev region ,",
    "not only strong celestial diffuse gamma rays but also the huge background gamma rays from the albedo and the satellite itself by irradiation of cosmic rays come to the detector in space .",
    "in addition , internal radioactivities in the detector emit both gamma rays and beta decay electrons faking a real gamma ray in compton detectors . good reviews of the analysis for the background in comptel were presented in this workshop@xcite . in order to achieve a sensitivity ten",
    "times better than comptel , another powerful method for the background rejection seems to be inevitable for the next mev gamma - ray imaging detector .    here",
    "we introduce the new type of a gamma - ray imaging detector based on a wireless gas detector , and the results of its performance study are presented .",

    "in order to obtain a 3-d track of a recoil electron , @xmath0-tpc has been developed , which measures the successive positions of the track of charged particles in a few hundred micron meter pitch@xcite .",
    "this @xmath0-tpc consists of the new type of a gas proportional chamber : @xmath0-pic which is one of wireless gas chambers and expected to be more robust and stable than micro strip gas chambers@xcite . at the first stage ,",
    "we have developed a prototype @xmath0-tpc having a detection volume of 10 @xmath2 10 @xmath2 8 @xmath3 .",
    "all results mentioned here are obtained using this prototype detector .",
    "we briefly mention the essential features of @xmath0-pic and @xmath0-tpc .",
    "@xmath0-pic is a gaseous two - dimensional position - sensitive detector manufactured by the printed circuit board(pcb ) technology .",
    "a schematic structure of the @xmath0-pic is shown in fig.[upic ] . with the pc - board technology ,",
    "large area detectors would be mass - produced with low costs .",
    "the pixel pitch of the @xmath0-pic is 400 @xmath0 m .",
    "@xmath0-tpc was stably operated with the gas gain of @xmath4 3000 for more than 1000 hours .",
    "each signal of an anode and a cathode is amplified and shaped with 80ns time constant and discriminated . for the energy measurement , analog signals of the amplifier connected to the cathode strips are summed 32 to one on the amplifier board , and its waveforms are recorded by the 8-channel 100 mhz flash adc ( fadc ) .",
    "energy resolution of @xmath5(fwhm ) was obtained for 5.9 kev x - rays . discriminated pulse ( lvds - level pulse )",
    "are fed to the encoder board comprising five fpga chips .",
    "here hit signals on the @xmath0-pic are synchronized with an internal clock ( 20 mhz ) , and their positions were recorded successively at an anode - cathode coincidence within one clock .",
    "therefore tilted particle track in the drift volume can be recorded as successive hit points as shown in fig.[track ] . in this way , we realize both three - dimensional tracking and spectroscopy of the charged particles with @xmath0-tpc@xcite .",
    "three - dimensional spatial resolution of 260 @xmath0 m was measured by the irradiation with proton beams .",
    "this spatial resolution is restricted by the clock rate of the electronics and the drift velocity in @xmath0-tpc ( @xmath4 5 cm per 1@xmath0s ) .",
    "all the test on the @xmath0-tpc described here were carried out using the ar-@xmath6 gas mixture with a normal pressure .",
    "[ track ] shows the examples of obtained tracks of low energy proton ( large _ de / dx _ ) and @xmath7-decay electron ( near minimum ionizing particle : mip ) , which indicates that more gain ( @xmath410000 , three times of the present gain ) is needed for the sufficient detection of mips .",
    "the detection efficiency for mips is @xmath4 10% when requiring at least 5 hit points in one track of mip . now",

    "energy and position resolutions of the anger camera for 662 kev gamma ray are 9 % and 7.5 mm at fwhm , respectively .",
    "our gamma - ray imaging detector consists of @xmath0-tpc and the anger camera , as shown in fig.[set - up ] , where a gamma - ray source and anger camera are placed 5 cm behind the @xmath0-tpc and 10 cm at the front of the @xmath0-tpc , respectively .",
    "we examined the imaging performance of the prototype detector with three gamma - ray energies of @xmath8(356kev ) , @xmath9(511kev ) , and @xmath10(662 kev ) . in the off - line analysis we required following constraints ; the minimum number of hit positions of the track in @xmath0-tpc ( at least five points per track ) , hit positions within fiducial volumes of both @xmath0-tpc and the anger camera , a loose requirement of an energy deposit in the anger camera , and the simple kinematic constraint for @xmath11 angle between the scattered gamma ray and recoil electron .",
    "since the energy calibration of the @xmath0-tpc was not so accurate to sum with the energy of the anger camera , an initial energy of gamma rays was treated as a known parameter .",

    "here we used only the events in which both a scattered gamma ray and a recoil electron were detected , and hence we could determine the direction of an incident gamma ray event by event .",

    "obtained resolution of 25 degree is about three times worse than the simulated one due to the insufficient gain of @xmath0-pic .",
    "thus we have achieved the full reconstruction of compton process event by event and obtained the true gamma - ray image although the resolution of an image was still primitive .",
