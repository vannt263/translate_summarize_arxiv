    "quantized vortices are among the hallmarks of superfluidity , and have been observed in the gaseous bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite , where repulsive interatomic interactions play a crucial role in nucleation and stabilization of vortices . in the case of attractive interactions , however , creating vortices by stirring the condensate in a harmonic trap is difficult because the vortex state is energetically unfavorable against decaying into the non - vortex ground state .",
    "a possible experimental scheme for creating a vortex state with attractive interactions is to prepare it in the repulsive regime and then switch the sign of the interaction to attractive by using , e.g. , the feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "another possible scheme to create vortices in an attractive bec is to imprint topological phases on the condensate using either controlled interconversion between two components  @xcite or spin rotation by adiabatic change of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the dynamical instabilities and ensuing dynamics of vortex states with attractive interactions in 3d axisymmetric traps .",
    "there are two types of instabilities that cause a vortex state to decay : dynamical and thermodynamic instabilities .",
    "dynamical instabilities , or modulational instabilities , set in when the bogoliubov spectrum acquires an imaginary part which causes an exponential growth in the corresponding mode .",
    "vortex nucleation  @xcite , vortex exchange between two components  @xcite , splitting of a vortex with attractive interactions  @xcite , and disintegration of a doubly - quantized vortex with repulsive interactions  @xcite are all attributed to dynamical instabilities .",
    "thermodynamic instabilities are caused by interactions between the condensate and the thermal cloud accompanied by dissipation of the energy and angular momentum .",
    "reductions in the number of vortices  @xcite , vortex bending  @xcite , and vortex - lattice formation  @xcite are associated with thermodynamic instabilities .",
    "the time scale of the latter instabilities at low temperatures is typically @xmath2 s or longer  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the time scale of dynamical instabilities can be much faster than that of thermodynamic instabilities since the former grows exponentially in time .",
    "we shall therefore focus on dynamical instabilities in this paper .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , pu _",
    "_ reported that singly- and doubly - quantized vortices in 2d exhibit a series of dynamical instabilities when the strength of interaction exceeds the corresponding critical values .",
    "we numerically solved the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for a 2d system , and showed that the vortex splits into two clusters which revolve around the center of the trap , and undergo split - merge cycles or collapse  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we examine such dynamics in full 3d systems and also study the dynamical instability of the doubly - quantized vortex , that was recently realized by the mit group  @xcite .",
    "our primary findings are the following : +  ( 1 ) our 3d analysis reveals that the dynamical instabilities depend crucially on the trap geometry . for a singly - quantized vortex",
    ", split - merge cycles can occur in a pancake - shaped trap , whereas the split fragments immediately collapse in a spherical trap . in a cigar - shaped trap",
    ", there is a parameter range in which the vortex can collapse into a single cluster due to the dipole instability .",
    "+  ( 2 ) the doubly - quantized vortex with attractive interactions is always unstable against disintegration of the vortex core .",
    "if the strength of interaction is suddenly changed to within a certain range , the vortex splits into three clusters which undergo split - merge cycles before one or possibly more of them collapse .",
    "+  ( 3 ) even when the lifetime of the condensate is very short , the phenomenon of vortex split can be observed by suddenly changing the interaction to a large attractive value .",
    "the split of a doubly - quantized vortex is shown to be observable using a current experimental setup of the mit group .",
    "+  ( 4 ) using a variational method , we find that both the split instability and the split - merge cycles can be understood by using only three basis functions .",
    "+  ( 5 ) in the immediate vicinity of the critical strength of interaction for the vortex split , quantum fluctuations like the ones found in a 1d case  @xcite become prominent .",

    "the time scale of such dynamical instability is given by the inverse of the imaginary part .",

    ". however , the mean - field theory used in the present paper is still valid except for this narrow critical region .",
    "we studied dynamical instabilities in singly- and doubly - quantized vortex states with attractive interactions , and found a rich variety of dynamics triggered by the dynamical instabilities .",

    "the emergence of a complex eigenvalue in some modes was reproduced by the gaussian trial functions .",
    "we were able to reproduce the split - merge cycles by assuming only three relevant modes with angular momenta @xmath246 and @xmath247 , suggesting that only a few modes are associated with the split - merge cycles .    in the immediate vicinity of the critical strength of interaction of the dynamical instability ,",
    "the transition from the axisymmetric vortex state to the split state is accompanied by divergence in the number of virtually excited atoms and by softening of the excitation mode according to the bogoliubov theory , which is very similar to the 1d case discussed in ref .",
    "the dynamical instabilities in vortex states of attractive becs therefore involve a fundamental generic issue of the decay of a many - particle quantum system .",
    "vortex - split phenomena are attributed to the interplay between the attractive interaction and the topological phase defect , that is , the condensate is bound to break axisymmetry , since they can not gather at the phase defect .",
    "the emergence of the dynamical instabilities and ensuing dynamics may be regarded as pattern formation due to symmetry breaking .",
    "more complicated and interesting pattern might be formed in the vortex lattice , which will be published elsewhere .",
    "dynamics after the collapse were not studied because 3d simulation of the collapse and explosion phenomena exceeds our present computational ability .",
    "the burst atoms ejected from each cluster interfere with each other and exhibit some anisotropic pattern if the burst atomic cloud is coherent .",
