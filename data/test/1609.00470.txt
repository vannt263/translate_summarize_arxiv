    "heat currents coupled to electric and spin currents can be effectively used in novel spintronics devices to control not only charge and entropy / energy transport but also to control spin transport .",
    "the latter is the main goal of spin caloritronics  a new branch of spin electronics .",
    "indeed , there is currently huge interest , both experimental and theoretical , in thermal generation of spin currents which in turn can be used to control magnetic state of a system .",
    "one should mention here the seebeck and spin seebeck effects , the nernst and spin nernst effects , and also others .",
    "theoretical description of the phenomena that occur as a system s response to a temperature gradient is generally more complex than description of a system subject to an external electric field . to describe heat / energy transport in the framework of green function formalism and kubo formula ,",
    "an auxiliary vector potential has been introduced@xcite instead of the luttinger gravitational potential introduced earlier  @xcite .",
    "such a vector potential may be considered as an analogue of the vector potential in the theory of electromagnetism .",
    "it is well known in the relevant literature , that to determine the system s response ( namely , the transverse electric current ) to a temperature gradient , the orbital magnetization should be taken into account in order to get results that obey the fundamental thermodynamics laws .",
    "in other words , electric current due to a nonzero orbital magnetization ensures physical behavior of the off - diagonal kinetic coefficients in the zero - temperature limit , such as off - diagonal electrical conductivity due to thermal bias .",
    "this problem was studied first by obraztsov  @xcite , who introduced the magnetization currents to the problem of the off - diagonal thermal transport in order to satisfy the onsager relations of the kinetic coefficients .",
    "this problem has been then raised in many papers , e.g. in the context of quantum hall effect  @xcite or nernst effect in fluctuating superconductors  @xcite and graphene - like materials  @xcite .",
    "the orbital magnetization appears as a consequence of the orbital motion of electrons when the time reversal symmetry in a system is broken  @xcite .",
    "this happens in the case of ferro- and ferrimagnets , or in nonmagnetic materials in an external magnetic field . in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , electron motion in a system",

    "such an interaction can appear as an effective momentum - dependent magnetic field , and may lead to such phenomena like spin hall and spin nernst effects that require neither magnetic materials nor external magnetic fields .    an important question which arises in the context of spin - orbit interaction concerns behavior of the off - diagonal spin - kinetic coefficients in systems with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "an important example of such systems is the two - dimensional electron gas with rashba spin - orbit interaction , that appears at the interface of semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "thermal properties of such systems have been studied recently in a couple of publications  @xcite . in our recent paper",
    "we have shown that to describe properly the low - temperature behavior of the spin nernst effect in a two - dimensional electron gas in frame of the linear response theory , one needs to introduce orbital effects as well  even though the system is symmetrical with respect to the time - reversal .",
    "the usual orbital magnetization is then suppressed due to the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore , we have introduced the _ spin - resolved orbital magnetization _ and have shown that it contributes to the spin current in thermal nonequilibrium , and therefore also to the spin nernst conductivity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed calculation of the spin - resolved orbital magnetization . in sec .  2 we describe the model and also present symmetry arguments for the spin - resolved orbital magnetization . in sec .",
