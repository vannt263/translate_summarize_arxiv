    ", we specified the radial distribution of the magnetic flux advection rate .",
    "accordingly , a decrease in temperature can result in an increase in magnetic pressure under the conservation of the magnetic flux in the vertical direction . in the low-@xmath1 solutions ,",
    "the magnetic heating is enhanced by the high magnetic pressure .",
    "the fraction @xmath377 of the magnetic heating goes into ions and is transferred to electrons via coulomb collisions .",
    "the fraction @xmath28 of the magnetic heating goes into electrons . eventually , the total amount of the magnetic heating goes into electrons and balances the radiative cooling ( compton cooling by bremsstrahlung and/or synchrotron photons ) . the electron temperature is lower than that in the adaf / riaf solutions ( @xmath378 ) and strongly anti - correlates with the mass accretion rate in the low-@xmath1 solutions .",
    "these features are consistent with the x - ray spectrum observed in the bright / hard state .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the mri is stabilized for @xmath379 .",
    "this indicates that the low-@xmath1 solutions disappear below this critical point .",
    "when the magnetic flux advection rate is high ( @xmath369 ) , the critical mass accretion rate of the low-@xmath1 solutions , @xmath373 , is above the maximum mass accretion rate of the adaf / riaf solutions , @xmath294 .",
    "therefore , the disk initially staying the adaf / riaf state undergoes transition to the low-@xmath1 state when the mass accretion rate exceeds @xmath251 , after that , the disk undergoes transition to the optically thick disk when the mass accretion rate exceeds @xmath373 .",
    "this corresponds to the bright / slow transition . on the other hand , when the magnetic flux advection rate is low ( @xmath380 ) , @xmath381 is below @xmath294 .",
    "therefore , the disk initially staying the adaf / riaf state immediately undergoes transition to the optically thick disk when the mass accretion rate exceeds @xmath251 .",
    "this can correspond to the dark / fast transition .",
