    "quantum entanglement  @xcite , as a cornerstone of quantum physics , plays a significant role in the foundation of quantum theory and also has potential applications in quantum technology , such as quantum information science  @xcite and quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "so far , one has had a fairly good understanding of how to generate entanglement among microscopic entities and entanglement has been successfully prepared and manipulated in variously microscopic systems theoretically and experimentally , such as atoms  @xcite , photons  @xcite , ions  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , nothing in the principles of quantum mechanics prevents macroscopic systems from attaining entanglement .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in investigating entanglement in mesoscopic and even macroscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that such entanglement might provide explicit evidence for quantum phenomena  @xcite and even might possibly help us to clarify the quantum - to - classical transition , as well as the boundary between classical and quantum worlds  @xcite .",
    "since mechanical oscillators resemble a prototype of classical systems , they are beginning to be important candidates for the investigation of quantum features at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales .",
    "additionally , with the rapid progress of practical technologies in cavity optomechanics , the mechanical oscillators can be cooled down close to the quantum ground state  @xcite .",
    "thus they provide a nature platform to explore quantum entanglement in macroscopic systems .    in recent years ,",
    "based on the optomechanical systems , some schemes have been brought forward to generate entanglement between macroscopic oscillators from many different angles of view : such as entangling two oscillators in a ring cavity  @xcite , entangling two distantly separated oscillators by utilizing the entangled light fields  @xcite , entangling two oscillators via a double - cavity set - up by driving squeezing optical fields  @xcite , entangling a fabry - prot cavity s two moving mirrors by driving an intense classical laser field  @xcite , entangling two dielectric membranes suspended inside a fabry - prot cavity  @xcite , entangling two macroscopic mechanical resonators induced by the radiation pressure of a single photon in a two - cavity optomechanical system  @xcite , and entangling two movable mirrors in an optomechanical cavity in which a kerr - down - conversion crystal consisting of a kerr nonlinear medium and an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) is placed  @xcite .",
    "in these schemes , however , the previous works  @xcite have verified that the injection of the squeezed field is the necessary condition to generate the desired entanglement .",
    "huang and agarwal  @xcite proposed a scheme to entangle two separated mechanical oscillators by injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the ring cavity .",
    "this scheme showed that the entanglement can be modulated via the squeezing parameter of the input light . in the case of no injection of the squeezed vacuum light , which means that the squeezed vacuum light is replaced by the ordinary vacuum light",
    ", there is always no entanglement between the separated oscillators .",
    "however , once the incident vacuum light is squeezed , the entanglement exists .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also proposed a scheme to generate a stationary entangled state of two movable mirrors if and only if the incident fields are squeezed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , even though the entanglement between two mechanical oscillators in an optomechanical cavity can be generated when the injected field is not squeezed , the region of entanglement is discrete and very narrow , so which inevitably brings difficulties to achieve the entanglement in experiment .",
    "however , when the injected field is adjusted to the squeezed field , the region of entanglement is continuous and greatly enlarged .",
    "in essence , the opa inside the optomechanical cavity can produce various novel effects including improvement of the cooling of the micromechanical mirror  @xcite , affection of the normal - mode splitting behavior of the coupled movable mirror and the cavity field  @xcite , achievement of strong mechanical squeezing  @xcite , and enhancement of the precision of optomechanical position detection  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear interaction processes between light and opa have been demonstrated as important sources of squeezed state of the radiation field  @xcite .",
    "agarwal and huang  @xcite have had the opa placed inside the optomechanical cavity so that the squeezing cavity field is generated inside the cavity . via driving the system by the red - detuned laser in the resolved side band limit",
    "makes the optomechanical interaction between the movable mirror and the cavity field like a beam - splitter interaction , the state of squeezed photons transfers to phonons with almost 100% efficiency , the strong mechanical squeezing is thus achieved .",
    "here we propose a scheme to modulate the entanglement between two oscillators separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the opa instead of directly injecting the squeezing field with the assistance of coulomb interaction .",
    "we show that the coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement and there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the gain of the opa and the phase of the pump driving the opa can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field , so the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly . in this way",
    "the modulation of the entanglement between the oscillators separated in space is achieved .",
    "in addition , we numerically simulate the critical temperature of such entanglement in experimentally feasible regimes .",
    "the results show that the laser driving power and the gain of the opa can improve the critical temperature .",
    "compared with previous schemes  @xcite , our scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> we propose a scheme to modulate the entanglement between two oscillators separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the optical parametric amplifier instead of injecting the squeezing field directly with the assistance of coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement . due to the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the pump driving the optical parametric amplifier </S>",
    "<S> can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field , the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with the assistance of coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the results of numerical simulation show that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment compared with previous schemes in experimentally feasible regimes . </S>"
