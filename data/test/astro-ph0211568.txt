    "eas experiments , combining field detector arrays - being capable in measuring the shower direction - with muon tracking detectors , can be used for determination of the mean muon production height ( mph ) , a parameter sensitive to the primary mass .",
    "muon tracks in air shower are , in general , not coplanar with the shower axis , which have led to the concept of tangential and radial angles @xcite . however , as it will be shown in the following , these two independent observables may provide a possibility to investigate the muon momentum components in showers .",
    "a good example of the eas experiment , where the ideas presented in this paper can be used is kascade @xcite with its recently introduced large muon tracking detector @xcite .",
    "we are using data simulated with corsika @xcite ver.5.644 and qgsjet hadronic interaction model for all discussions and examples given below .",
    "as it is shown in fig . [ angles ] , shower direction and the location of the muon detector define two perpendicular planes : _",
    "tangential _ and _ radial _ ones .",
    "tangential angle @xmath1 and radial angle @xmath2 are angles between the shower direction and the orthogonal projections of the muon track onto the tangential and radial planes , respectively .",
    "the measured value of @xmath1 reflects the amount of muon scattering in the atmosphere and any relevant absorber / detector material , together with a possible displacement of the muon production place from the shower axis .",
    "its distribution ( fig .",
    "[ taucont ] ) is symmetrical around zero and gets narrower with the increase of the muon momentum , what one could expect from the quantity related to the multiple scattering .            a typical distribution of the radial angle is shown in fig .",
    "its value depends on the muon parent s ( meson s ) transverse momentum and the distance of the muon to the shower axis at the observation level . in real experimental conditions muons",
    "are sampled within certain range of distances from the core .",
    "the shaded distribution is shown for a typical distance 20 m - 180 m from the core .",
    "the large @xmath2 values are removed .",
    "as it is seen from fig . [ angles ] , using simple trigonometry and substituting tangent for an angle , what is correct within 5@xmath3 error up to @xmath4 ,",
    "one can write the following expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 :              so , measuring in an experiment angles of a shower and of muons and calculating @xmath2 and @xmath1 , by means of @xmath0 one gets the possibility to investigate the muon momentum space .",
    "the precision of @xmath0 depends on the precision of angular measurements in the air shower , and , in particular , on the precision of muon tracking .",
    "it is known , that the tracking accuracy improves when the high energy muons only are considered .",
    "therefore , one would like to have as large content of high energy muons in the analyzed data sample as possible .      a typical muon momentum distribution in showers initiated by proton primaries with @xmath11=@xmath10 ev is shown in fig .",
    "[ mendistr ] . in all",
    "simulated showers ( solid line ) @xmath12 @xmath13 are muons with momentum larger than 10 gev / c . in real experimental conditions , where a threshold , eg .",
    "1  gev / c , is present and muons are registered in a restricted range of distances to the shower core , one gets the shaded distribution in fig .",
    "[ mendistr ] . in this sample , with significantly reduced statistics , there is already @xmath12 45 @xmath3 of muons with @xmath14 @xmath15 10  gev / c .",
    "however , one would like to increase high energy muon content in the data sample even more , and for this purpose the @xmath0 parameter can be used .    indeed , as seen from fig .",
    "[ zetamom ] , @xmath0 shows strong dependence on the muon momentum . while at low momenta the full spread of @xmath0 values is observed , its distribution becomes more confined to the low values with the increase of the muon momentum .",
    "the mean value of @xmath0 decreases with momentum exponentially , what is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ zetamom ] .",
    "so , it is possible to use in the analysis the cut on the @xmath0 value and , in this way , to increase the high energy muon content in the analyzed sample .    in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] the ratio of muons with momentum larger than 10 gev / c to all muons in a sample ( above the threshold of 1 gev / c ) as a function of the applied cut on @xmath0 value is plotted for two primary proton energies . only muons in the distance between 20 and 180 m to the shower core were considered .",
    "it is seen that choosing for the analysis muons e.g. with @xmath0 @xmath16 0.02 results in significant increase of the high energy muon content in the data sample .",
    "another application of the @xmath0 parameter is rather straightforward .",
    "its value is nothing else but a tangent of the muon angle versus the shower axis .",
    "so , knowing the distance to the shower core a simple triangulation allows to reproduce the muon production height .",
    "it is , off course , assumed that muons stem from the shower axis , what is generally not true .",
    "but , it turns out , that such approximation works well .    ) and reconstructed , using parameter @xmath0 , ( mph ) muon production height distributions for two primaries , proton and iron , of @xmath11=@xmath10 ev .",
    "data sample was enriched in high energy muons by selecting muons with @xmath0 @xmath16 0.02 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ mph ] the true muon production height distributions ( @xmath17 ) are compared with the calculated ones ( mph ) , using the just mentionned procedure , for two primary species , h and fe with energy @xmath11=@xmath10 ev . in these calculations",
    "a cut on @xmath0 @xmath16 0.02 was applied .",
    "one sees a good agreement of both curves .",
    "the mean production height values are separated by more than 2 kilometers for proton and iron .",
    "so , one can use this procedure of calculating mean muon production height for the primary mass determination .",
    "parameter @xmath0 can be used for investigation of muon rapidities in showers . substituting momentum for the total energy , which is allowed above 1  gev without signifcant error",
    ", one can express rapidity @xmath18 and pseudorapidity @xmath19 using parameter @xmath0 as follows :        as an example in fig .",
    "[ eta ] pseudorapidiy distribution of muons in showers initiated by proton primary with the energy @xmath11=@xmath25 ev is shown . only muons with momentum larger than 1  gev / c",
    "are considered .",
    "dotted line shows all pseudorapidity values for all simulated muons .",
    "solid line corresponds to the case , where @xmath19 can be calculated using parameter @xmath0 , i.e. for muons with absolute values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 less than 0.4 radian .",
    "dashed line corresponds to the case , where the distance of muons to the shower core is in the range of 20  -  180  m. the large values , being the most interesting ones , are cut away due to 20 m minimum distance , so it is important to come with measurements as close to the core as possible .",
    "the above example shows , that by means of @xmath0 it is possible to investigate rapidities of muons in showers . in general ,",
    "measuring directional parameters of muons in showers by means of the @xmath0 parameter one can investigate muon momentum space .",
