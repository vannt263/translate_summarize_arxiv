    "the radio - pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 is the only binary pulsar known to consist of two radio pulsars : psr j0737 - 3039 a @xcite and psr j0737 - 3039 b @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : system - parameters ] gives the parameters of this system .",
    "this unique configuration has permitted measurements of spin orientation for both pulsars @xcite : pulsar a s spin is tilted from the orbital angular momentum vector by _ no more than _ 14 degrees at 95% confidence @xcite ; pulsar b s by @xmath2 degrees at @xmath1% confidence . here",
    "we argue that this large difference between the two pulsar spin tilts requires that the origin of most of b s spin is connected to its supernova ( sn ) explosion ; the spin of b s progenitor , expected to be aligned with the pre - sn orbit due to tidal interactions , can not be invoked to explain the present - day misaligned spin of pulsar b. psr j0737 - 3039 b is currently believed to have formed from an electron - capture supernova triggered in a massive o - ne - mg white dwarf @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that , whatever the details of its formation mechanism , the supernova that formed psr j0737 - 3039 b produced the majority of its current spin",
    ". if the source of the present - day spin of pulsar b is a single , impulsive kick , then this kick must be off - center so that it tumbles the pulsar to its current orientation .",
    "using constraints on the sn kick magnitude derived from the orbital and kinematic parameters of the system @xcite we find that this kick must have been displaced from the center of mass of the exploding star by at least 1 km and probably 510 km .",
    "such offset distances are a significant fraction of the expected radii of neutron stars .",
    "off - center kicks were first suggested in @xcite on purely theoretical grounds .",
    "psr j0737 - 3039 likely evolved from two stars originally massive enough to undergo supernova ( sn ) explosions and form two neutron stars @xcite at the end of their nuclear lifetimes . given the measured spin magnitudes and",
    "inferred magnetic fields @xcite , pulsar a was the first - born neutron star , while pulsar b formed in a second sn .",
    "after the first sn the system passed through a high - mass x - ray binary phase . in this phase , pulsar a accreted matter from its companion , leading to some spin - up",
    ". eventually , pulsar a s companion evolved off the main sequence and its expanding hydrogen envelope enveloped pulsar a. in this common - envelope phase , tidal interactions between the stars circularized the orbit and are expected to have aligned the spins of pulsar a and of pulsar b s progenitor with the orbital angular momentum axis ( perpendicular to the orbital plane ) .",
    "the transfer of orbital kinetic energy to the envelope eventually removed the outer layers of pulsar b s progenitor , leaving pulsar a in a tight orbit with the exposed helium - rich core of b s progenitor .",
    "after another brief period of mass transfer onto pulsar a @xcite , the helium star exploded in the second sn , forming pulsar b. as a result of the multiple mass - transfer phases between the two sn events , just before pulsar b s sn the system was in a close , circular orbit with _ both stars spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector_.    due to asymmetries associated with the sn ejecta ( matter and/or neutrinos ) sne",
    "are thought capable of imparting a significant recoil impulse , a `` kick '' , to any remnant surviving the explosion ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when a sn occurs in a binary system , these kicks can significantly alter the orbital parameters or even disrupt the binary .",
    "the kick component directed parallel to the pre - sn orbital plane causes a change in the eccentricity and semi - major axis of the orbit ; the component perpendicular to the pre - sn orbital plane can also cause a change in the inclination of the orbital plane . in the psr j0737 - 3039 system , pulsar a s small spin - tilt angle ( less than 14 degrees at 95% confidence using a two - pole emission model @xcite ) is indicative of a relatively small out - of - plane kick from the sn that formed pulsar b @xcite .",
    "pulsar a s spin - orbit misalignment occurs only because the orbital plane is tilted by the sn kick , while pulsar a s spin remains fixed in the inertial frame aligned with the pre - sn orbital angular momentum axis ( figure [ fig : system - geometry ] ) .",
    "such a spin tilt for pulsar a occurs independently of the effects of the second sn on pulsar b s spin . in other words ,",
    "the observed tilt of pulsar a s spin by itself does not require any change in the spin angular momentum of pulsar b relative to its progenitor .",
    "however , unless the sn contributes significant amounts of angular momentum to the nascent pulsar , the orientation of pulsar b s spin will be the same as its progenitor s spin , i.e.  aligned with the pre - sn orbital plane and pulsar a s spin .",
    "surprisingly , pulsar b s spin is in fact retrograde : tilted by @xmath2 degrees ( 99.7% confidence ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relative to the current orbital angular momentum vector ( see figure [ fig : system - geometry ] ) !",
    "to produce pulsar b s retrograde spin , the sn must have significantly torqued pulsar b , causing it to tumble to the currently observed spin - orbit orientation .",
    "the pre - sn spin , @xmath3 , the angular momentum produced by the sn ejecta , @xmath4 , and the post - sn spin , @xmath5 , are related by the conservation of angular momentum @xmath6    to determine @xmath4 , we must know @xmath3 and @xmath5 , but we only know the direction , not the magnitude , of @xmath3 and the relationship between @xmath5 and the spin measured today is complicated by relativistic precession @xcite . however , we can still place constraints on @xmath4 .",
    "relativistic precession causes the individual pulsar spins to precess about the total angular momentum of the system , which is approximately parallel to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "such precession preserves the angle between the total angular momentum and the spin ( which is the spin colatitude ) , but not the azimuthal orientation .",
    "thus , the colatitude of @xmath5 relative to the normal to the current orbital plane is equal to the colatitude of the current spin130 degrees .",
    "based on the spin of pulsar a , the current orbital plane could be tilted at most @xmath7 degrees relative to the pre - sn orbital plane .",
    "therefore the colatitude of @xmath5 relative to the pre - sn orbital plane  and therefore relative to @xmath3is at least 116 degrees .",
    "this is also the minimum angle between @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "the angular momentum produced by the sn must be _ significantly _ mis - aligned with the progenitor spin .",
    "to date , most sn simulations have focused on non - rotating progenitors ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it remains to be seen whether the spin produced by the sn from the collapse of a _ rotating _",
    "progenitor can be so significantly mis - aligned with the progenitor s rotation axis .",
    "the typical moment of inertia @xcite of a neutron star is @xmath9 ; using pulsar b s measured mass of @xmath10 ( see table [ tab : system - parameters ] ) and a radius of @xmath11 km , its current spin angular momentum is @xmath12 g @xmath13 s@xmath14 . since this spin is retrograde whereas the pre - sn spin is roughly aligned ( within 14@xmath15 , given pulsar a s small spin tilt ) with the current orbital plane , we can place a lower limit on the change of angular momentum needed to explain pulsar b s large and retrograde spin tilt , @xmath16 where equality holds when @xmath17 . because the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is greater than 90 degrees ,",
    "any progenitor spin only increases the amount of angular momentum that must be added to the pulsar by the kick .",
    "this is demonstrated geometrically in figure [ fig : spin - geometry]c .",
    "the above discussion has been fully general .",
    "to extract more constraints from the observed spin - spin misalignment , we must make some assumptions about the origin of the pulsar spin . as a simplified model to elucidate the scales involved in this scenario ,",
    "let us assume that the same impulsive kick ( i.e.  linear momentum ) that changes the orbit of the system is also offset from the center of mass of pulsar b , and therefore applies a torque sufficient to produce the observed spin angular momentum .",
    "the kick and offset vectors must lie in the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 ( see equation [ eq : spin - change ] ) .",
    "the kick velocity , @xmath18 , the offset vector relative to the center of mass , @xmath19 , and the change in b s spin vector are related by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the change in linear momentum induced by a change in velocity of @xmath18 in an object with mass @xmath22 .",
    "the offset length @xmath23 and kick velocity magnitude @xmath24 must then satisfy the inequality @xmath25 where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the change of b s spin ; the equality holds only when the kick and offset are perpendicular to each other .",
    "the relative orientation of the current spin provides a constraint on the kick direction in this scenario .",
    "let the colatitude of @xmath26 relative to the pre - sn orbital plane be @xmath27 ; because the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is greater than 90 degrees , no matter the magnitude of @xmath3 we must have @xmath28 degrees . let the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 make an angle @xmath29 with respect to the pre - sn orbital plane .",
    "then we have @xmath30 degrees .",
    "the kick , @xmath18 , lies in this plane and therefore must have colatitude @xmath31 that satisfies @xmath32 this geometry is illustrated in figure [ fig : spin - geometry ] .",
    "the constraint in equation [ eq : theta - constraint ] is consistent with the constraint on kick colatitude in figure 7 of @xcite , but tighter .",
    "the constraint on the magnitude of the spin change , equation ( [ eq : delta - s - mag ] ) , together with equation ( [ eq : min - distance ] ) , imply a lower limit on the offset distance @xmath33 if we assume that the core of pulsar b s progenitor was in synchronous , rigid - body rotation just before the supernova then @xmath34 , and the limit on the offset distance rises by a factor of @xmath35 : @xmath36    @xcite used the measured semi - major axis , eccentricity and proper motion of the j0737 - 3039 system ( see table [ tab : system - parameters ] ) to constrain the kick imparted to the system by the second sn .",
    "the @xcite analysis assumed that the pre - sn orbit was circular and that the system came from a progenitor population with number density @xmath37 with @xmath38 kpc and @xmath39 kpc the galactic scale length and height , respectively , moving with the local galactic rotation velocity .",
    "the sn kick and mass loss must then induce the current eccentricity and semi - major axis in the orbit and give the system as a whole a velocity such that it moves in the galactic potential to its current location in the 100 to 200 myr since the second sn @xcite .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the amount of mass loss , pre - sn semi - major axis , pre - sn galactic location , the age of the system , and the measurement uncertainty in the current orbital parameters , a range of kick magnitudes between 0 and 60 km / s is allowed in the @xcite analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : offset - pdf ] we show the probability distribution of minimum offset distances implied by this distribution of kick velocities . even for large kick velocities , the minimum offset distance exceeds @xmath40 km .",
    "for the smallest allowed kicks , the minimum offset distances exceed the current @xmath41 km radius of the neutron star .",
    ".[tab : system - parameters ] j07373 - 3039 system parameters . except as noted ,",
    "properties are given in @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the magnitude of the offset , @xmath23 , required to produce the needed @xmath42 depends on the relative orientation of the offset and kick , @xmath18 .",
    "if the angle between @xmath19 and @xmath18 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 is @xmath43 , then @xmath44 which is larger than the minimum offset distance by a factor of @xmath45 ( see equation [ eq : spin - change ] ) .",
    "kicks that are nearly aligned with the radial vector ( small @xmath43 ) require arbitrarily large off - center distances to match the current spin orientation .",
    "even modest misalignments of 40 degrees give an enhancement factor of @xmath46 over the offset for perpendicular @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "multi - dimensional simulations @xcite of core - collapse sne have shown that an instability in a stationary accretion shock ( sasi ) may provide a method of depositing a substantial amount of spin angular momentum ( @xmath47 g @xmath13 s@xmath14 ) onto a proto - neutron star as part of the collapse process itself and separate from any rotation of the progenitor .",
    "( in fact , the simulations of @xcite used non - rotating progenitors . )",
    "this would be more than enough angular momentum to account for the observed spin angular momentum of pulsar b ( @xmath12 g @xmath13 s@xmath14 ) .",
    "the general consensus from recent evolutionary studies @xcite is that pulsar b was formed in an electron - capture sn , where an iron core is never formed and instead core collapse is initiated through electron captures onto ne / mg nuclei @xcite . during the course of such a collapse , the proto - neutron star shrinks from a radius of @xmath48 km to @xmath41 km .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption of the foregoing discussion that the kick is applied at a single location is simplistic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; in a real supernova , both linear and angular momentum will be accumulated by the proto - neutron star throughout its formation at many different locations . in this more realistic context , the constraints above on offset distances should be interpreted instead as constraints on the offset scale at which the _ bulk _ of the linear and angular momentum is accumulated .",
    "more precise constraints will require detailed modeling of the hydrodynamic process of momentum accumulation in the supernova that formed psr j0737 - 3039b .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting that the location of kicks inferred from such a simple model is consistent with kick origins in the bulk of the shrinking proto - neutron star during the supernova ( see figure [ fig : offset - pdf ] ) .",
    "some recent sn modeling suggests that the processes that produce the kick and those that impart rotation to the resulting neutron star produce independent kicks and spins , and therefore there is little correlation between the kick magnitude and direction and the rotation imparted to the post - sn compact object @xcite . in this case",
    "the offset length scale inferred above from the dynamical constraints on the kick would not be relevant .",
    "we conclude that _ only if _ pulsar b s spin is actually linked to the torque induced by the physical mechanism producing the kick it must be offset from the center of mass of the collapsing neutron star progenitor .",
    "regardless of the specifics of the collapse process , however , the expected alignment of the spin of pulsar b s sn progenitor with the pre - sn orbital angular momentum and the observed misalignment of pulsar b s spin and orbit at present uniquely imply that pulsar b s spin is dominated by angular momentum produced during the sn process , not angular momentum provided by the progenitor .",
    "the realization of this empirical constraint on angular momentum production in supernovae presented here is uniquely enabled by the spin spin misalignment in the psr j0737 - 3039 system @xcite and can be used to guide core - collapse simulations and the quest for the understanding of compact object spins and kicks .",
