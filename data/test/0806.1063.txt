    "neoplastic diseases are the cause of 7 million deaths annually or 12of deaths worldwide @xcite .",
    "mathematical and computer modelling may lead to greater understanding of the dynamics of cancer progression in the patient @xcite @xcite .",
    "these techniques may also be useful in selecting better therapeutic strategies by subjecting available options to computer testing ( _ in silico _ ) .",
    "continuous models have been proposed to describe the stages of tumor growth since the middle of the 20th century @xcite .",
    "initially , a tumor grows exponentially ( linear rate ) .",
    "after this transient stage , the growth rate decreases and a steady state is attained , due to several factors including a lack of nutrients and hypoxia .",
    "this nonlinear behavior characterizes avascular tumor growth when neovascularization has not yet been triggered .",
    "the decelerating avascular growth may be guided by different rules such as , for example , gompertzian and logistic functions .",
    "gompertzian growth has been one of the most studied decelerating tumor growth over the past 60 years @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is found , for example , in some solid tumors such as breast carcinomas @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is also observed in tumors _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "although continuous models are capable of describing the behavior of tumor growth , it would appear more reasonable to adopt a discrete approach when describing the prevascular stage .",
    "due to the fact that the angiogenic process has not triggered early tumor growth , few cancer cells are present and growth depends predominantly on the interactions of these cells with adjacent cells and with the environment @xcite . in addition , in the discrete approach , it is easier to capture the time - spatial pattern generated by the model in order to compare it with actual patterns @xcite .",
    "some cellular automata models @xcite @xcite and hybrid cellular automata @xcite @xcite @xcite have been proposed to study tumor growth .",
    "another important topic that is analyzed in mathematical models is the response to therapy , including how tumor growth changes under the effect of a drug @xcite .",
    "the focus is directed towards identifying the optimal therapy to maximize the effect on cancer cells and minimize the effect on normal cells @xcite @xcite .",
    "although various continuous chemotherapy models exist @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to the best of our knowledge the majority of the discrete models cited in the literature have not yet been used to investigate this topic .",
    "the objective of this work is to propose a two - dimensional cellular automata model consisting of 4 states ( empty site , normal cell , cancer cell or necrotic tumor cell ) to describe avascular tumor growth .",
    "it should be emphasized that in this study the term tumor growth is used to refer to the number of cancer cells rather than the volume of the tumor ; in other words , it is assumed that the tumor volume is proportional to the number of cancer cells @xcite .",
    "assuming that the angiogenic process has not yet been triggered , there is no increase in nutrients , which are uniformly distributed over the lattice . in this simple model ,",
    "some relevant processes involved in the prevascular phase of tumor growth are assessed : a dynamic proliferation of cancer cells and the competition between normal cells and cancer cells for nutrients and/or space . since necrosis is often present in the prevascular stage of tumor growth @xcite @xcite , the possibility of necrosis in the model",
    "must also be taken into consideration .",
    "finally , the effect of therapy is included in order to investigate whether the system evolves to a state of cure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the model is presented , together with its local rules , parameters and the scope of the algorithm .",
    "section [ sec3 ] describes the simulated time series of cell density in the presence or absence of treatment , and shows the features of the time - spatial pattern of simulated solid tumors . in section [ sec4 ] , the parameter related to the process of necrosis and the effect of therapy is analyzed .",
    "finally , in section [ sec5 ] , our results are discussed from the point of view of the phenomenon and some concluding remarks are made .",
    "we propose a two - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) cellular automata model @xcite under periodic boundary conditions , using a moore neighborhood with a radius of 1 . at the initial condition ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "there is only one cancer cell ( to ensure better visualization , this was taken from the center of the lattice ) . since the intention it to model a non - viral tumor , normal cells would not be transformed into cancer cells with the exception of the cancer cell that triggers tumor growth at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the lattice represents a tissue sample ; there is a cell in each site that may be in one of four states : normal cell ( noc ) , cancer cell ( cc ) , necrotic cell ( nec ) or empty site ( es ) .",
    "we assume that the nutrients are uniformly available over the lattice . in this respect ,",
    "lack of space is identified with lack of nutrients in our model .",
    "there is a growth potential @xmath3 value associated with each normal or cancer cell .",
    "although the two - dimensional character of the model mimics the _ in vitro _",
    "situation , the growth potential of cancer cells simulates the three - dimensional tumor _ in vivo _ in the sense that it represents the total number of cancer cells , i.e. , in addition to the cancer cells on the lattice , the cancer cells generated by these cells .",
    "the local rules are such that :    * \\(i ) the initial value of the mitotic probability of cancer cells is represented by a parameter @xmath4 that measures the available resources at the beginning of the tumor .",
    "after that , it decreases by a factor @xmath5 until reaching the null value : @xmath6\\ ] ] + in which @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number of normal and cancer cells at time @xmath9 , respectively . as shown , @xmath10 depends only on the dynamics , setting up a feedback inhibition mechanism @xcite : as the tumor grows , @xmath10 decreases because of the combined effect of the decrease in the number of normal cells and the increase in the number of cancer cells . in order to intensify the effect of this mechanism ( see @xcite ) , an exponent 2 in equation ( [ pmitot ] ) is considered .",
    "since there is no new available source of nutrients and/or space , it decreases as the density of cancer cells increases because the available nutrients and/or space are reduced .",
    "the effect of the proliferation of cancer cells is that their growth potential increases by a unit at each time step . *",
    "\\(ii ) the cancer cells compete with normal cells for the empty sites , depending on the potential growth of neighboring cells . according to the majority rule , a normal cell is displaced by a cancer cell following local battles occurring between healthy and cancerous cells [ 15 ] . *",
    "\\(iii ) if the growth potential of a cancer cell reaches a threshold value that is a fraction @xmath11 of the lattice size @xmath12 , it becomes necrotic and its growth potential falls to zero . *",
    "\\(iv ) both normal and cancer cells may die , with probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , due to the continuous infusion of a drug that is applied after tap time steps ; in this case , the site becomes empty . *",
    "\\(v ) if there are no cancer cells in the neighborhood of a dead cell ( empty site ) , regeneration of normal cells occurs ; if the cancer cells in the neighborhood of a necrotic cell die as a result of the therapy , the necrotic cell is eliminated .",
    "the algorithm was computationally implemented in fortran 77 in accordance with the following steps : input data ; calculate @xmath10 ; identify the state of the cell ( choose one of the subroutines : normal cell ( noc ) , cancer cell(cc ) , necrotic cell(nec ) , empty site ( es ) ; update the cells of the lattice ; after n iterations , output data .    the input data are the following cellular automata ( ca ) parameters :    * \\1 ) the spatial parameters : lattice size l ; necrosis threshold fraction @xmath11 of lattice size ; * \\2 ) the temporal parameters : the length of the time series t final and the initial time of therapy infusion @xmath15 ; * \\3 ) the probabilities of : the initial proliferation of cancer cells @xmath4 ; the effect of therapy on normal cells and cancer cells ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the output data are the time series of the density of each type of cell and the final configuration of the lattice at any time step .",
    "in addition , the time - spatial configurations , controlled by a package denominated g2 @xcite whose commands are inserted into the computer program in fortran , are generated in `` real time '' .",
    "this package may be used in c , python and perl .",
    "the following is a description of each subroutine based on the local rules :    * \\a ) * normal cell ( noc ) * - a random number @xmath16 is compared to @xmath13 . if @xmath17 , the growth potential @xmath18 is confirmed : if @xmath19 , the cell dies and the site becomes empty ; otherwise , it remains occupied by a normal cell but @xmath20 . if @xmath21 and if there is at least one neighboring cancer cell , then the normal cell is dislocated , @xmath19 and the site becomes empty ; otherwise it remains a normal cell .",
    "* \\b ) * cancer cell ( cc ) * - if all of its neighbors are cancer cells and its growth potential reaches a fraction @xmath11 of lattice size @xmath12 , the cancer cell becomes necrotic .",
    "otherwise , a number @xmath16 is randomly chosen .",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the potential @xmath24 is confirmed : if @xmath25 , it is reduced by a unit and the cell remains a cancer cell ; otherwise the cell dies and the site becomes empty . finally , if @xmath26 , the cell remains a cancer cell ; however , its growth potential @xmath24 increases by a unit .",
    "* \\c ) * necrotic cell ( nec ) * - if at least one of its neighbors is neither a cancer cell nor a necrotic cell , it is eliminated and the site becomes empty ; otherwise , it continues necrotic .",
    "* \\d ) * empty site ( es ) * - if there are cancer and normal cells in its neighborhood , the local battle between cancer cells and normal cells is such that if the sum of the potential growth of its neighboring cancer cells is greater or equal to the sum of the potential growth of its normal cell neighbors , then the empty site is occupied by a cancer cell that diffuses from one of the randomly chosen neighbors ; otherwise , it is occupied by one of the randomly chosen normal cells that were previously dislocated . if there are only normal cells in its neighborhood , it becomes a normal cell through a process of regeneration . finally ,",
    "if none of its neighbors are cancer cells or normal cells , it remains empty .",

    "the model proposed in this study is capable of capturing the gompertzian behavior of avascular tumor growth .",
    "the competition between normal and cancer cells and the dynamic character of the mitotic probability are the relevant components of the success of this model .",
    "the number of cancer cells simulates tumors _ in vitro _ due to the two - dimensional character of the model , and their potential growth simulates a tumor in vivo due to its three - dimensional nature .",
    "figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure4 ] show that the model is able to capture the dynamics of both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    "avascular tumor growth .",
    "the simulated values for the most important gompertzian parameter @xmath49 , which characterizes the gompertzian shape , are compatible with the parameter values of some tumors @xcite @xcite .",
    "the model is also able to capture necrotic and nonnecrotic tumors depending on the values of the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "it is well - known that necrosis , unlike apoptosis , is a typical phenomenon found in a group of cells that is simulated in our model by the changing of the potential growth of the cells .",
    "the time - spatial patterns reveal a tumor with a compact shape and irregular boundaries , as occurs in some solid tumors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "evidence was also found to confirm the three stages of avascular tumor growth @xcite :    * \\a ) stage i - when the tumor grows exponentially due to available resources ( nutrients and oxygen ) - see first stage in figure [ figure5 ] ; * \\b ) stage ii - when the stabilization of @xmath116 starts but there are still enough resources to ensure that necrosis does not occur - see second stage in figure [ figure5]b ; * \\c ) stage iii - when necrosis may occur depending on the value of the parameter @xmath11 because the resources are insufficient to provide for tumor growth - see third stage in figure [ figure5]c in the case of necrosis .",
    "the next stage , the angiogenic phase of the tumor @xcite , which has not yet been dealt with in our model , corresponds to vascular growth . to be able to evaluate this stage ,",
    "the process of angiogenesis would have to be taken into account @xcite .    in the case of no treatment ( @xmath117 ) , the minimum value of @xmath11 for necrosis to occur is governed by the equation ( [ fmin ] ) that was obtained from the investigation of the parameter space .",
    "this means that , for a simulated tissue of dimension @xmath12 , the occurrence of necrosis depends linearly on the maximum value of mitotic probability of the specific tumor .",
    "in relation to the case in which therapy was implemented , a continuous strategy of systemic therapy , i.e. chemotherapy , was selected .",
    "although the schedule of chemotherapy is usually periodic , in this case it was decided to simulate this less realistic situation so that the effect of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath14 could be compared in a simple fashion .",
    "it was thus found that , with respect to avascular tumor growth , when the values of the parameter @xmath13 are very small and when @xmath14 is slightly greater than @xmath4 , the tumor is completely eliminated ( see figure [ figure7 ] ) .",
    "since neovascularization has not yet been triggered , a state of cure may be expected to occur with a periodic schedule .",
    "the time - spatial patterns of the cases in which therapy was implemented ( see figure [ figure8 ] ) show that the drug acts from the borders of the simulated solid tumor inwards , as would be expected in the case of solid tumors .    with respect to the effect of parameters on the state of cure , for fixed values of lattice size @xmath12 and necrotic parameter @xmath11 , and for a range of values of @xmath15 and @xmath13",
    ", the minimum value of @xmath14 again coincides with @xmath4 ( see figure [ figure9 ] ) .",
    "this reinforces the importance of the higher value of @xmath4 in the response of the tumor to therapy .",
    "it retains the memory of cancer cells with respect to the onset of mitosis .",
    "finally , figures [ figure10 ] and [ figure11 ] illustrate a very relevant finding from the phenomenological point of view : the importance of initiating therapy as early as possible in order to reach the state of cure .",
    "the cure time was found to be proportional to @xmath15 that measures the instant when the infusion starts ( see figure [ figure11 ] ) and the minimum value of the therapeutic infusion to eliminate the tumor increases nonlinearly as a function of the starting point of therapy .",
    "future studies should be carried out to generalize the model with the objective of including the angiogenic process and the periodic schedule of systemic therapy . however , the most important perspective of this line of investigation is to compare the model with the in vitro tumor growth of cells from specific tissue samples and to compare parameter values .",
    "it would then be possible to relate the gompertzian fitting parameters with the parameters of the model .",
