    "( bec ) in ( quasi- ) two - dimensional systems has only recently been obtained in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "thus , many properties have yet to be explored both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we present an investigation of an isotropic two - dimensional bec with the aim of providing detailed predictions for comparison with future experiments .",
    "the manner in which dimensionality can fundamentally alter the physics of a system is clearly apparent in the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem , which forbids a spontaneously broken symmetry with long range order in a homogeneous two - dimensional system @xcite . in terms of the coherence function @xmath0",
    ", this means that @xmath1 , which can be seen as the definition of bec @xcite , is impossible for @xmath2 in a uniform two - dimensional system .",
    "thus , in a two - dimensional bose gas bec can not occur at finite temperatures .",
    "phase fluctuations make the formation of a globally coherent phase impossible . despite this ,",
    "a different transition of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type @xcite to a state with an analytical decay in the coherence function is possible in the ideal system .    with confinement in a harmonic trap ,",
    "the modified density of states allows the 2d system to bose condense .",
    "nevertheless , below the critical temperature there is a large phase fluctuating regime in which the superfluid is best described as a quasicondensate @xcite . unlike a true bec , phase coherence only extends over regions of a size smaller than the extent of the condensate , characterized by the coherence length .",
    "this regime has been referred to as the kt phase , although the physical state of the interacting system in this phase fluctuating regime has yet to be thoroughly investigated .",
    "phase fluctuations can enter the uniform gas in the form of vortex / antivortex pairs , or topological charges , which unbind at the point of the kt transition .",
    "thus , the phase fluctuating state may well be a regular lattice of pairs of opposite topological charges in the sense of the kt phase , but this is not the only possibility and further investigation is required .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    "we have discussed how the semi - classical approximation fails to describe bec consistently in two dimensions and have shown results to prove that these problems can be removed by applying the more complex hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism .",
    "the aim of the present publication is to present a detailed and more complete discussion of the properties of a two - dimensional bec as is possible within the hfb - popov approach .",
    "our emphasis lies on the coherence properties which are crucial for the question of whether the superfluid state is best described as a bec or as a quasicondensate . in the following section we outline the hfb formalism and explain our methods of obtaining solutions .",
    "then , in section [ sec_results ] , we present our results , such as the density profile of the condensate and non - condensate , the excitation spectrum and the coherence function . in section [ ssec_coh ]",
    "we present the momentum profile and coherence length of a phase fluctuating condensate , indicating how these could be measured in forthcoming experiments .",
    "our work is concluded in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the time - independent , second quantized form of the grand - canonical many - body hamilton operator for our system is given by @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the single particle hamiltonian with the external potential @xmath5 of the atom trap , and @xmath6 is the coupling parameter that characterizes interparticle scattering . for collision processes , we assume a hard sphere potential within the usual pseudo - potential approximation @xcite , @xmath7 . for a dilute gas",
    "this is a good approximation , however care must be taken in determining the coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "usually it is derived from an approximation to the two - body t - matrix in the zero - energy and zero - momentum limit , as appropriate for scattering processes in an ultra - cold system . in three dimensions , the two - body t - matrix for a dilute gas is well described within the s - wave approximation , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the s - wave scattering length . in two dimensions , however , the two - body t - matrix vanishes at zero energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , many - body effects introduced by the surrounding medium must be taken into account when studying two - dimensional gases . for a trapped gas ,",
    "this leads to a spatially dependent coupling parameter @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the exact form of the coupling strength depends on the tightness of the confinement in the axial direction . with the parameters from @xcite , using the terminology of @xcite",
    ", we consider this system to be in the quasi-2d regime .",
    "therefore , for the calculations undertaken in this work , we use the following approximation to the many - body t - matrix at zero temperature for the coupling parameter @xcite : @xmath11 the scattering length @xmath12 in the quasi-2d regime is given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "this result was first obtained by petrov _",
    "_  @xcite by considering the 2d scattering problem .",
    "we will present a detailed study of interactions in the 2d bose condensed system elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we decompose the bose field operators , in the standard fashion @xcite , into classical and fluctuation parts , @xmath15 , where the condensate wave function @xmath16 is normalized to the number of particles in the ground state , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , yielding the hfb - hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the condensate , non - condensate and total densities , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath24 are referred to as quasiparticle amplitudes , and @xmath25 are the quasiparticle energies .",
    "the first term in is the condensate part and merely a @xmath26-number .",
    "the second term is the hamiltonian for non - interacting quasiparticles and is formally equivalent to the case of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the constant energy shift @xmath27 arises from the bogoliubov transformation @xcite and from terms left over from the quartet operator averages of the fluctuation operators which are factorized in a fashion analogous to wick s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  4.2 ) . however , this energy shift has no impact on the solution of the hfb equations .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian requires that the order parameter obeys the  ( gpe ) @xmath28 and that the quasiparticle amplitudes and energies obey the coupled  ( bdg ) equations @xmath29 so as to eliminate off - diagonal terms in the quasiparticle field operators .",
    "the bdg equations determine the elementary excitation modes of the condensate .",
    "we refer to , together with , as the hfb equations . note that we have taken the popov approximation by neglecting the anomalous average of the fluctuation operator , @xmath30 , whereby avoiding divergence problems of this quantity and the occurrence of a gap in the excitations spectrum @xcite .",
    "once the bdg equations are solved , the non - condensate density @xmath31 can be obtained by populating the quasiparticle states , @xmath32 where the quasiparticle distribution function with the inverse temperature @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 here , the fugacity @xmath35 is determined by the difference between the chemical potential @xmath36 and the condensate eigenvalue @xmath37 , @xmath38 , since the quasiparticle energies are measured relative to the condensate @xcite . to a good approximation",
    ", we can use the result for the non - interacting gas , @xmath39 the system we consider has a finite number of atoms .",
    "the fugacity fulfills the practical purpose of preventing the number of thermal atoms from exceeding the total atom number and , hence , the condensate density from becoming negative in our numerical calculations .    in order to study coherence properties ,",
    "we calculate the normalized first order correlation , or coherence function , which can be written in terms of the field operators as @xcite @xmath40 given the decomposition of the field operator , the coherence function can be expressed in terms of the off - diagonal densities @xmath41 the latter can be calculated from the off - diagonal version of .",
    "using the above for the correlation function , gives @xmath42 the correlation function is related to the momentum spectrum of the condensate by a simple fourier transformation , @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the field operators in momentum space .",
    "this implies that coherence properties can be directly measured in an experiment , as has been done in @xcite for the quasi - one - dimensional case by means of bragg spectroscopy . in a bragg experiment ,",
    "the propagation speed of the light field is determined by the detuning of the crossed laser beams @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spectral response of the condensate is measured as a function of the detuning . to establish the relationship with the momentum distribution",
    ", we use the relation between the detuning @xmath46 and the momentum within the condensate plane @xmath47 for a @xmath48-photon process , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath37 is the wavelength of the light field ( @xmath51 nm for rubidium @xcite , @xmath52 nm for sodium @xcite ) , and @xmath53 the mass of the atoms .",
    "we discuss some aspects important to the solution of the finite temperature hfb equations .",
    "the trapping frequency in the axial direction is sufficiently large so that the dynamics in this dimension are frozen out ( @xmath54 ) . in the radial plane , we consider an isotropic trapping potential with the radial frequency @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "thus , our system is cylindrically symmetric and we can effectively treat the problem as one - dimensional upon changing to cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we scale all equations to computational units , lengths by the oscillator length , @xmath57 , and energies by the rydberg of energy , @xmath58 .",
    "the calculation follows a self - consistent , iterative scheme , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "first , the gpe is solved with the non - condensate density set to zero .",
    "taking this calculated condensate density , the bdg equations are solved to obtain the quasiparticle modes .",
    "these are then populated through the quasiparticle distribution function , with the sum of all the excited particles yielding the thermal density . with the non - condensate density",
    "now known , we go back and solve the generalized gpe and the whole process is repeated until convergence .    to begin",
    ", we expand the order parameter in a set of basis states . a convenient basis for this problem is given by the eigenstates of the 2d harmonic oscillator , since the single - particle hamiltonian is diagonal in this basis .",
    "to take the cylindrical symmetry into account , we write the eigenfunctions of the oscillator problem @xmath59 in terms of the laguerre polynomials @xmath60 , @xmath61 with the eigenenergies @xmath62 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath53 defines the angular momentum .",
    "since the condensate ground state has zero angular momentum , for the solution of the gpe merely the @xmath63 subspace must be considered . in order to numerically solve the gpe , we use an optimization routine with a thomas - fermi profile as the initial guess .",
    "the solution of the bdg equations follows the method described in @xcite . in a first step ,",
    "the bdg equations are decoupled by a transformation to the auxiliary functions @xmath64 . omitting spatial dependencies ,",
    "this leads to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hamiltonian in the generalized gpe .",
    "the auxiliary functions @xmath67 are then expanded in the basis set in which @xmath68 is diagonal .",
    "this basis we term the hartree - fock ( hf ) basis and it is obtained by the full solution of the generalized gpe , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the hf basis .",
    "the primary advantage of this basis is that all excited states are by definition orthogonal to the condensate , after the lowest momentum state , which is the condensate state itself , has been removed from the basis set .",
    "both the calculation of the hf basis , as well as the solution of the decoupled bdg equations are only linear problems , since the condensate density is given from the solution of the gpe , and can be solved in a straightforward manner .",
    "the eigenvalue problem corresponding to the bdg equations is block - diagonal with no overlap between the subspaces of different angular momentum , so that the solution to can be obtained separately in each subspace .",
    "the thermal density then follows from by summing up the contributions from all angular momentum subspaces .    naturally , the number of basis states used in the discrete , quantum mechanical calculation is limited by an upper energy cutoff , @xmath71 , which must be introduced consistently in all angular momentum subspaces . to account for the contributions above the energy cutoff",
    ", we use the semi - classical approximation @xcite , so that @xmath72 the contribution @xmath73 below the cutoff is given by the addent in , and above the cutoff by the semi - classical equation , with the heaviside function @xmath74 , and again omitting spatial dependencies , @xmath75",
    "we will now present the results of our numerical calculation .",
    "we consider a sample of 2000 sodium atoms that are trapped in a harmonic potential with the parameters of the experiment by grlitz _",

    "the temperature dependent term in leads to the formation of the characteristic off - center peak of the non - condensate density .",
    "it is located at the edge of the condensate due to the repulsion of the thermal atoms by the condensate .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : nth - nc ] , where the two densities @xmath77 and @xmath78 are plotted together . in comparison to the rapidly decaying condensate density",
    ", the thermal density has a long tail .",
    "thus , the condensate is relatively dense with a sharp peak within the diffuse thermal cloud .",
    "the tail of the thermal cloud becomes longer as the temperature increases , while the condensate radius does not change significantly even if the number of condensate atoms drops by an order of magnitude .",
    "note that the long tail contains a large number of atoms despite its low density because the spatial integral is weighted by a factor of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 in three dimensions ) .",
    "the slight change in the size of the condensate can also be seen in the shift of the non - condensate peak towards the trap center with increasing temperature , remaining located at the edge of the condensate . note that even at zero temperature there is a small fraction of excited atoms due to the temperature - independent quantum depletion term in .    from the existence of a well defined condensate and non - condensate density we can already infer coherence information . following the argument in @xcite , a measure of phase fluctuations",
    "is given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the phase fluctuation operator in the alternative decomposition @xmath83 .",
    "phase fluctuations become important when @xmath84 .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath85 , these fluctuations are suppressed in the system .    ' '' ''      in figure [ fig : population ] the condensate population is shown as a function of temperature . the results are compared to the case of the trapped ideal gas , where the population is determined by a power law expression .",
    "we fit the following functional form to the numerical data : @xmath86 in the case of the ideal gas , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the fit",
    "the critical temperature is reduced by a factor of about 5% with @xmath89 .",
    "this shift has two contributions : the finite size of the system reduces the critical temperature @xcite , but it is also modified by the interactions .",
    "this second contribution as been extensively discussed in the literature , see the recent publication @xcite and references therein . for the exponent",
    "we find @xmath90 , which is 15% smaller than for the ideal trapped gas . with these values ,",
    "parameterizes our data very well except near the critical temperature , where finite size effects are significant and the exact method of determining the shift of the chemical potential from the condensate eigenvalue becomes important .    in the ideal gas",
    "the chemical potential is zero at the point of the phase transition , and therefore the transition point is strictly defined . in the interacting gas ,",
    "the chemical potential depends implicitly on the non - condensate @xcite and , when this becomes large , the transition point becomes smeared out .",
    "technically , the occurrence of the finite temperature tail can be explained through the fugacity term in the quasiparticle distribution function , which is explicitly given by .",
    "the term @xmath91 prevents the condensate population from becoming negative .",
    "however , this expression for the fugacity is only approximate and the shape of the tail and the speed with which it approaches zero depends on the explicit choice of the fugacity term at temperatures around @xmath92 .",
    "the low - lying collective or elementary excitation modes of the condensate , determined by the solution of the bdg equations , are of interest because they reflect certain fundamental symmetry properties of the system , as well as being easily accessible to experiments .",
    "figure [ fig : excitations ] shows the modes with angular momentum @xmath93 as a function of temperature .",
    "each of the three branches corresponds to the lowest quasiparticle energy eigenvalue in the lowest three , separated , angular momentum subspaces , in which the bdg equations are solved , section [ ssec_num ] .",

    ", the non - condensate density grows and starts to constitute a deviation from the harmonic oscillator potential in the effective potential of the , so that the frequency shifts slightly from @xmath95 .",
    "the effective potential is weakened by the presence of the static thermal atoms so that the frequency decreases .",

    "similar behaviour has been observed in calculations for the one - dimensional bose gas at finite temperatures @xcite .",

    "the lorentzian momentum profile has been found to be characteristic of the phase - fluctuating quasicondensate @xcite and has been used as an the identifying signature of such a phase @xcite .",

    "furthermore , from looking at the correlation function in figure [ fig : g1_popov ] , we would expect the phase fluctuations to become important , indicating the presence of a quasicondensate , at about @xmath120 , long before the momentum profile becomes lorentzian in character .",
    "we have used the hfb formalism to investigate the finite - temperature physics of a bose - einstein condensate confined to a two - dimensional geometry . unlike the three dimensional case , phase fluctuations must be taken into consideration at comparatively lower temperatures . in a regime below the critical temperature",
    "they destroy the global coherence of the condensate and the superfluid state is best described as a quasicondensate . in the hfb formalism phase fluctuations are included via the contribution to the non - condensate density from low - energy quasiparticles .",
    "we have shown that the formalism is not only applicable in the strictly phase coherent regime , but also that the quantities obtained , such as the single - particle off - diagonal density matrix , allow for a quantitative analysis even in the phase fluctuating regime .",
    "our work is consistent with @xcite , although we find that , within the hfb treatment , the pure condensate phase persists to higher temperatures .",
    "the coherence length of the condensate can be determined from its correlation function or the momentum profile .",
    "following aspect _ et al . _  for the one - dimensional case @xcite , we have calculated the bragg spectrum for a condensate in two dimensions .",
    "we found the values extracted for the coherence length to be in qualitative agreement with those calculated for the one - dimensional bose gas , although a true bec with global phase coherence still exists at much higher temperatures than in the 1d case .",
    "the bragg spectrum provides a clear signature of the quasicondensate phase and we anticipate experimental efforts in this area in the near future .",
