    "the casimir effect @xcite is a manifestation of the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field .",
    "it was first considered in systems with boundaries , and it is known that the casimir force is highly sensitive to the size , geometry and topology of such boundaries . in particular it may change from attractive to repulsive depending on such shape @xcite .",
    "but the casimir force is also present in systems with no boundaries and a compact topology , since the latter imposes periodicity conditions which resemble boundary conditions .    if our universe is either open or flat , with non - trivial topology , or closed , every quantum field living on it should generate a casimir type force , which led many authors to study the casimir effect in frw models ( see @xcite and references therein for a review ) . in the case of a spherical universe ,",
    "most computations of the casimir energy , or more generically , of the renormalised stress energy tensor , have focused on conformally coupled scalar fields .",
    "for instance , a massless conformally coupled scalar field , the electromagnetic field and the massless dirac field on an einstein static universe , have been considered in @xcite ; their casimir energies have been shown to be of the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , respectively , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that all of these are positive . since these are all conformally coupled fields",
    ", they have equation of state @xmath5 , and obey the strong energy condition .",
    "this means the casimir force is attractive .",
    "but this is not always so in the cosmological context .",
    "zeldovich and starobinskii @xcite have indeed verified long ago that the casimir energy of a scalar field could drive inflation in a flat universe with toroidal topology .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to exhibit a family of quantum scalar fields which originate a repulsive casimir force in a closed universe , since they violate the strong energy condition .",
    "interestingly , this family includes the simplest case one could consider : a minimally coupled massless scalar field with no potential .",
    "our computation will be performed in the einstein static universe ( esu ) , which can be faced as an approximation to a dynamical frw model in sufficiently small time intervals , and avoids having to deal with the complexities of quantum field theory in a time dependent spacetime , like particle creation .",
    "we consider the esu , which is a well known solution of the einstein equations sourced by a perfect fluid with positive energy density ( @xmath6 ) and zero pressure ( @xmath7 ) together with a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the metric is @xmath11 we have written the metric on the unit 3-sphere , @xmath12 , in terms of right forms on @xmath13 . in order to achieve a static solution , the cosmological constant and the energy density are related by @xmath14 .",
    "another viewpoint is that the esu is supported by a perfect fluid with @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that this universe is unstable against small radial perturbations as was first argued by de sitter .",
    "the reason is that the energy density of the perfect fluid increases / decreases with decreasing / increasing radius , whereas the one of the cosmological constant is kept constant . since the former gives an attractive contribution and the latter a repulsive one , any displacement from the original equilibrium position will grow , rendering such original position as unstable .",
    "but even without such classical perturbations this universe is unstable due to quantum mechanics .",
    "these are the instabilities we will focus on , in the spirit discussed at the end of the introduction .",
    "let us consider a free ( i.e with no potential ) scalar field @xmath16 , with mass @xmath17 and with a coupling ( not necessarily conformal ) to the ricci scalar of the background @xmath18 , governed by @xmath19 conformal coupling is obtained in four spacetime dimensions by taking the coefficient @xmath20 ( and the theory is then conformal if @xmath21 ) , whereas minimal coupling corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "the compactness of the spatial sections of the background guarantees a discrete mode spectrum which can be easily obtained using elementary group theory .",
    "we take the dalembertian in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the right vector fields dual to @xmath25 and @xmath26 is one of the two casimirs in @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the eigenfunctions of the klein - gordon operator @xmath28 may be taken in the form _",
    "n= e^-it_j^m_l , m_r  , [ eigenfunctions ] where the index @xmath29 represents all quantum numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 represents a wigner d - function @xcite .",
    "such function may be thought of as a spherical harmonic on the 3-sphere or as a matrix element of the rotation operator @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the basis of a representation of @xmath13 and @xmath34 are euler angles .",
    "it follows straightforwardly that the dispersion relation becomes _",
    "j^2=+^2  ,  j=0,,1,, ",
    "[scalaresu ] with the degeneracy of each frequency being @xmath35 , in agreement with the spectrum found in @xcite .",
    "note that there are no unstable modes for @xmath36 , which includes minimal and conformal coupling .",
    "this is the range of couplings we will analyse in the following .",
    "canonical quantisation of the scalar field can be performed unambiguously .",
    "one finds the mode expansion @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the volume of the constant @xmath39 hypersurfaces and with the operators @xmath40 obeying the usual commutation relation @xmath41=\\delta_{nn'}$ ] .",
    "the classical energy momentum tensor of the scalar field is more conveniently written in the natural tetrad basis @xmath42 , t_ab=*k*_a_b-_c^c - g_ab^2+(g_ab-_a*k*_b+g_ab)^2  , [ emtensor ] where we have denoted @xmath43 .",
    "the conformal case ( @xmath44 ) has zero trace ; quantum mechanically , however , the renormalised energy momentum tensor for a conformally coupled , free massless scalar field generically develops a trace anomaly , which can be written solely in terms of geometric quantities of the background @xcite . in four spacetime dimensions such anomaly takes the form t^a _  a_ren = \\{c_abcdc^abcd-(r_abcdr^abcd-4r_abr^cd+4 ^ 2 ) } + ^2  .",
    "[ anomaly ] the coefficient @xmath45 is renormalisation scheme dependent .",
    "this trace is zero for the esu : the ricci scalar is constant , the weyl tensor @xmath46 vanishes since the geometry is conformally flat and the second euler density also vanishes , since the euler characteristic of any odd dimensional sphere is zero .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 )    at this point let us make a comment which also works as a consistency check .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics yields @xmath59 , where the total energy @xmath60 .",
    "we can easily check that this holds both for the infinite unrenormalised quantities ( [ massive1 ] ) and the finite renormalised ones ( [ rhorenm1 ] ) @xmath61 thus , we could have only computed the energy density and have deduced the pressure via the first law of thermodynamics , which obviously only states the conservation of energy @xmath62 .",
    "this is exactly what shall be done in the cases to follow .    as a check on the result ( [ rhorenm1 ] )",
    "let us consider another renormalisation method , namely zeta function .",
    "we can write the regularised expression as |(s)=_n=1^+  , [ masszeta ] where @xmath63 has dimension of mass and @xmath64 which , for @xmath65 , has the appropriate form to be written in terms of epstein - hurwitz zeta functions |(s)=(_eh(s/2 - 1,a^2)-a^2_eh(s/2,a^2 ) )  .[massreg ] in order to obtain the renormalised energy density we should now consider the limit of this expression when @xmath66 .",
    "the epstein - hurwitz zeta function is only defined by the infinite sum @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "its analytic continuation to other values of @xmath69 , which converges for all @xmath69 with the exception of an infinite number of poles is given by @xcite _ eh(s , a^2)=-+(a^2)^1/2-s+_n=1^+n^s-1/2k_s-1/2(2n )  , [ ehzeta ] where @xmath70 are modified bessel functions , and @xmath71 is required to be positive .",
    "it is simple to see that the infinite series converges for all @xmath69 , since the modified bessel functions have asymptotic behaviour @xmath72 the poles of @xmath73 arise at the poles of @xmath74 , that is at @xmath75 , @xmath76 .    since @xmath71 must be positive",
    "this technique does not apply in the case of a massless minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "let us focus on the case with @xmath77 . applying ( [ ehzeta ] ) to ( [ massreg ] ) we find +   .",
    "[ zeta ] the point @xmath78 is exactly at one of the poles of the analytic continuation of the epstein - hurwitz zeta function .",
    "that is , the right hand side of the last formula is an infinite quantity , and it might seem that the zeta function method fails . with the correct interpretation",
    "this is not so .",
    "let us consider separately two cases :    @xmath79 : :    conformal coupling ( @xmath20 ) and arbitrary mass : this    case is obtained by substituting @xmath80 in    ( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "the infinite contribution , i.e the term with    @xmath81 in the @xmath78 limit , is exactly    the @xmath82 independent term .",
    "thus , despite its ( infinite )    contribution to the casimir energy it will not contribute to the    casimir _",
    "force_. this argument would be enough to neglect it , and to    suspect this is the flat space contribution . to confirm this is indeed    the case compute the flat space result by taking the infinite radius    limit of ( [ masszeta ] ) :    @xmath83    this is exactly the infinite term obtained after zeta function    regularisation .",
    "@xmath79 : :    nonconformal coupling : in the generic case , the divergent term can not    be identified with the flat space contribution , since it does depend    on @xmath82 . however , it turns out that the correct result is    still obtained by simply dropping out the divergent terms , as will be    shown below . doing so , the final answer for the renormalised vacuum    energy density of a scalar field with generic coupling is +     .",
    "[ rhorenm2 ]    an expression equivalent to ( [ rhorenm2 ] ) was first derived , for the particular case of @xmath20 , in @xcite , using a different renormalisation technique .",
    "it was argued therein that such renormalised energy momentum tensor could lead to a self consistent esu solution of the semi - classical einstein equations .",
    "we shall come back to this point in section 4 .",
    "the advertised check on our calculation of the casimir energy for a massive , conformally coupled , scalar in the esu can be performed graphically ; plotting the result ( [ rhorenm2 ] ) for @xmath20 , we have checked that it perfectly coincides with the previous one ( [ rhorenm1 ] ) , plotted in figure [ rhomassivefig ] .",
    "the zeta function method confirmed the damping factor method used originally in @xcite .",
    "but is unfortunately inapplicable to the most general situation when @xmath84 which includes the interesting case of a massless minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "we will now study this case by a variation of the damping factor method",
    ". the essential ingredient will be the abel - plana formula which we use in the form @xcite _ m = b^+g(m)=_b^+g(t)dt++i_0^+ dt  .",
    "[ abelplana ] we regularise the vacuum energy density in the following way    positive function of its argument that grows sufficiently fast with @xmath29 so as to make the sum converge for any @xmath85 .",
    "a convenient choice obeys @xmath86 it can be written explicitly as @xmath87 the integration constant has been chosen such that @xmath88 as the frequency vanishes , which means that the damping factor is not altering the long wavelength modes .",
    "this seems to be the most physical choice , since these long wavelength modes are the ones responsible for the casimir energy .",
    "we divide the situation with a stable spectrum into two cases which we analyse separately :    @xmath79 @xmath89 ( includes conformal coupling with arbitrary mass ) . applying the abel - plana formula ( [ abelplana ] ) with @xmath90 to the regularised expression ( [ regomega ] ) we find @xmath91dt}\\ . \\earr\\ ] ] the first integral became exactly the contribution of flat space ( which justifies our choice of @xmath92 ) . indeed , from ( [ regomega ] ) _",

    "splitting the @xmath39 integral in @xmath98 , one can check that only the second one contributes .",

    "ren=_^+dt  .",
    "[ rhorenm3 ] this expression was first obtained for the special case of conformal coupling @xmath20 in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "specialising for such coupling , the plot of this function exactly coincides with the ones in figure [ rhomassivefig ] , again checking the result .",
    "it is quite striking that expressions apparently as distinct as ( [ rhorenm1 ] ) , ( [ rhorenm2 ] ) and ( [ rhorenm3 ] ) are actually different representations of the same function .    for a more general coupling with @xmath89",
    ", we can also check that the result ( [ rhorenm3 ] ) coincides with the one computed with the zeta function method ( [ rhorenm2 ] ) , where we dropped out the divergent term , even though it could not be clearly interpreted as the flat space contribution .",
    "such term should seems to renormalise the gravitational action in the way described in @xcite .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the renormalised energy - momentum tensor , which will be determined by the finite part of the result , we will not dwell any longer on this point .",

    "we find @xmath101 where @xmath102 the flat space contribution is still ( [ flats ] ) , when @xmath103 .",
    "for the tachyonic case the flat space contribution is more subtle , so we will restrict our analysis to @xmath99 and @xmath103 . subtracting the flat space quantity and removing the regulator @xmath51 we find the renormalised energy density +  . despite the apparent unfriendly expression ,",
    "this is a real quantity which can be plotted without great difficulty . using the last formula and ( [ rhorenm3 ] ) we have plotted several cases , with different @xmath104 s , in figure",
    "[ minimal ] .",
    "the most noticeable feature is that both the renormalised energy density and pressure may become negative for a range of values .",
    "clearly this leads to violations of the strong energy condition , as will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "let us close by remarking that for zero mass , the renormalised energy density and pressure can be written , for arbitrary coupling , in the form _",

    "more interestingly it can lead to a cosmological bounce . to understand how ,",
    "let us briefly consider the backreaction problem by taking the semiclassical einstein equations , @xmath106 analysing the simple massless case ( [ masslessprho ] ) , for @xmath107 , we conclude that the quantum fluid can support a self consistent einstein static universe with some radius , a fact first noticed in @xcite .",

    "there is a short accelerating phase , which is followed by a matter era and then cosmological constant domination .",
    "what is most interesting on having this casimir energy induced bounce is that it does not rely on any particular form of a potential , and the scalar field needs not having classical effects whatsoever .",
    "it is its shear existence that originates the effect .",
    "of course this is by no means a complete cosmological model of our universe .",
    "one obvious problem is how to include the radiation era in the picture , which has the same @xmath114 dependence for the energy density as the casimir energy momentum tensor . indeed , nucleosynthesis data constraints the influence that the quantum fluid could have over that period and therefore , since they vary equally with @xmath82 , over any period where they both exist .",
    "a way around this problem could be to assume that radiation is only created after the quantum fluid domination epoch .",
    "such mechanism could be similar to the usual reheating at the end of inflation .    in any case",
    ", this simple model illustrates the point that the casimir energy could both source an early inflationary epoch and avoid the big bang singularity in a closed universe .",
    "note that despite having zero mass @xmath17 , the non - minimal coupling @xmath104 works , in the einstein static universe as an effective mass of order @xmath115 .",
