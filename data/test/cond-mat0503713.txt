    "the emerging field of spintronics @xcite , also known as magneto- or spin - electronics , has provided a strong motivation towards the fabrication of novel magnetic materials .",
    "a strong interest has been focused on the so - called half - metallic ferromagnets , _",
    "i.e. _ metallic compounds for which either the majority or minority spin - channel presents a gap at the fermi level @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such behavior is detected in various perovskite structures @xcite , some oxides like cro@xmath1 @xcite and magnetite ( fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ) @xcite , several heusler alloys @xcite , or some diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite .    in 2000 ,",
    "akinaga and collaborators succeeded to grow a thin film of the binary alloy cras on top of gaas @xcite .",
    "it was found that cras was actually continuing the zinc - blende ( zb ) structure of gaas crystallizing in a metastable phase .",
    "the most astonishing property was the total spin magnetic moment of 3 @xmath4 , which is consistent with the half - metallic character predicted by relevant electronic structure calculations published in the same paper and reproduced with larger accuracy in latter publications @xcite .",
    "the thin films of cras have also the great advantage of a high curie temperature @xmath5 , exceeding the 400  k ( limit of the magnetometer used in the experiment ) @xcite .",
    "this discovery intrigued the interest of experimentalists and several attempts were made to grow similar metallic compounds as thin films .",
    "et al . _ have grown zb crsb films by molecular beam epitaxy and found a @xmath5 similar to the cras case @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the growth of small zb mnas islands on gaas substrates @xcite has been achieved and cras / gaas multilayers have been fabricated @xcite showing that coherent heterostructures are possible .",
    "these half - metallic materials combine high values of @xmath5 with the coherent growth on top of semiconductors and as the know - how on the growth increases , they can be considered as very promising candidates for spintronics applications .",
    "several theoretical studies have been devoted to the zinc - blende compounds of transition elements with group - v and vi elements ( respectively , pnictides and chalcogenides ) .",
    "the calculations of the total energy and structural optimization show , in agreement with experiment , that the ground state crystal structure of these compounds is not of the zinc - blende type . in most cases",
    "the equilibrium crystal structure is of the nias type @xcite .",
    "this structure does not lead to half - metallicity @xcite .",
    "the zinc - blende structure can only be obtained by the epitaxial growth of few layers on semiconductors .",
    "galanakis and mavropoulos studied in detail the magnetic properties and the position of the fermi level in zb v- , cr- and mn - pnictides and chalcogenides as a function of the lattice constant @xcite .",
    "several authors have confirmed these results @xcite .",
    "some of the binary semiconductors crystallize in the wurtzite structure and a number of studies is devoted to such systems @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the case of half - metallic zb mnc compound whose properties differ from the properties of other mn compounds @xcite . also the cases of unsupported clusters @xcite and nanocrystallites @xcite have been studied .",
    "an important aspect of the studies is the stability of the half - metallic gap .",
    "it has been shown that the tetragonal deformation of the zb lattice does not destroy the gap @xcite and for some systems it even makes the zb structure more stable @xcite .",
    "contrary to other half - metallic systems , in the case of the zb transition metal compounds it is possible to retain the half - metallicity both at the surfaces of these materials @xcite and in the case of multilayers with binary semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the v and cr atoms have the ability to increase considerably their spin moment as a result of decreasing number of neighbors keeping in this way the half - metallicity of the system .",
    "contrary to cr and v , the mn spin moment is saturated in these compounds that leads to the loss of the half - metallicity at the surface @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling has very weak effect on the spin - polarization of the electron states at the fermi level for the @xmath6 atoms up to 5th period of the mendeleev s table @xcite . in the case of mnbi , where bi is a heavy element from the 6th period",
    ", the spin - orbit coupling leads to the decrease of the spin - polarization from 100% to 77% @xcite . recently ,",
    "chioncel and collaborators studied the influence of the correlation effects on the electron structure of cras @xcite .",
    "they found that the spin - magnon interaction leads to the appearance of nonquasiparticle states in the spin - minority channel .",
    "the states are shown to lie above the fermi level and to be sensitive to the lattice constant .",
    "in contrast to the gap properties , the exchange interactions in these compounds attracted much less attention .",
    "shirai has shown that in the case of pnictides ( vas , cras and mnas ) the ferromagnetic state is energetically preferable compared to the antiferromagnetic state @xcite . only in the case of zb",
    "feas an opposite trend was found @xcite .",
    "sakuma demonstrated that the mn compounds isoelectronic to cras ( mnsi , mnge and mnsn ) are half - metallic ferromagnets @xcite . in these compounds ,",
    "similar to cras , the long - range ferromagnetism is stabilized by the short - range direct mn - mn interaction and an indirect interaction through the @xmath6 atoms . the curie temperature in both cras and the isoelectronic mnz compounds",
    "was found to exceed 1000  k @xcite .",
    "kbler calculated @xmath5 for vas , cras and mnas and found the largest value of 1041  k in the case of cras compared with 764  k in vas and 671  k in mnas @xcite . taking mnas as an example",
    ", it was shown that the loss of the half - metallicity in a compressed lattice leads to a strong decrease of the curie temperature @xcite .",

    "their mean field approximation ( mfa ) results agree with the calculations of other authors while the values of @xmath5 obtained with monte carlo simulations are @xmath7100 k lower than the mfa values for vas and mnas and @xmath7300 k for cras .",
    "note that the mean - field formula for the curie temperature used in references @xcite is derived for a single - sublattice system .",
    "therefore the exchange interaction between 3@xmath8 and @xmath6 atoms is not treated consequently .",
    "also the formula of kbler @xcite is derived for an one - sublattice case . in general , the treatment of a multiple - sublattice materials needs solving a system of equations with the number of equations equal to the number of sublattices ( section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "below we show that for materials studied in this paper the one - sublattice approximation is well founded .",
    "in other systems , however , it leads to a large error @xcite .    in this work",

    "we study two cr compounds , cras and crse , and four mn compounds , mnas , mnsi , mnge and mnc .",
    "mnas is isoelectronic to crse whereas other three mn compounds are isoelectronic to cras .",
    "we use the calculated exchange parameters to estimate the curie temperature in both the mean field approximation ( @xmath9 ) and random phase approximation ( @xmath10 ) . a special attention",

    "we begin with the discussion of the cr compounds : pnictide cras and chalcogenide crse . the half - metallicity in these compounds results from the formation of bonding and antibonding hybrides between the @xmath52 states ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) of the transition metal atom ( here cr ) and the @xmath56 states of the four neighboring @xmath6 atoms ( as or se ) . the hybridizational gap is partly filled by the @xmath57 states of the @xmath58 atom ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "the hybridization takes place in both spin channels .",
    "the position of the hybridization gap is different for majority and minority electrons as a consequence of the exchange splitting @xcite .",
    "there are in total four occupied minority states , one coming from the @xmath61 states of the @xmath6 atom and three bonding 3__d _ _ states .",
    "the minority - spin @xmath57 orbitals lay above the fermi level .",
    "thus the total spin moment @xmath62 in @xmath63 is given by the relation @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell @xcite .",
    "in the cases of cras ( 11 valence electrons ) and crse ( 12 valence electrons ) the total spin moment should be 3 and 4 @xmath4 , respectively .    in table",

    "both compounds are half - metals .",
    "this is seen in figure [ fig1 ] where the spin - projected density of states ( dos ) is presented .",
    "the total spin moment is exactly integer as expected for a half - metallic system .",
    "the cr atoms posses a very large spin moment of 3.24 @xmath63 in cras that reaches the value of 3.92 @xmath63 in crse . a larger moment of crse is a consequence of one extra valence electron per formula unit . both as and se atoms have small induced moments antiparallel to the cr moments .",
    "the discussion of the spin moments of the @xmath6 atoms and their relative magnitude can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the half - metallic gap of crse is much larger than for cras .",
    "this is explained by the larger cr moment in crse that leads to a larger exchange splitting @xmath66 and , as a result , to a higher position of the minority @xmath57 bands .",
    "case in table [ table1 ] ( fermi level at the higher - energy edge of the half - metallic gap ) and the bottom to the a@xmath50 case in the same table ( 1% contraction of the lattice constant with respect to the a@xmath49 case ) . ]    in the next step , we compress the lattice simulating a hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the contraction of the lattice constant results in a higher energy position of the majority @xmath56 states with a corresponding increase of the fermi energy , @xmath67 .",
    "the calculations are performed for two decreased values of the lattice parameter . the first ( case ii ) corresponds to the position of the fermi level at the bottom edge of the minority - spin conduction band ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the second parameter ( case iii ) is obtained by a further 1% decrease of the lattice constant . in the latter case",
    "the fermi level lies within the spin - minority conduction band .",
    "since half - metallicity is lost the total magnetic moment in case iii becomes non - integer ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the contraction of the lattice leads to an increase of the hybridization between the cr states and the states of the @xmath6 atoms .",
    "as the result , both the cr moment and the induced moment of the @xmath6 atom decrease . in case",
    "ii , the changes of different moments compensate resulting in the same integer total moment .",
    "the decrease of the cr spin moment causes a small decrease of the width of the gap .",
    "next we used the frozen - magnon approach to calculate the exchange parameters for both systems and three values of the lattice constants ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the exchange interaction between the induced moments of the @xmath6 atoms is very small and the corresponding parameters are not presented .    for the semiconductor lattice parameter ( left panels in figure [ fig2 ] )",
    "the interactions are characterized by the large ferromagnetic coupling of the nearest cr atoms . in cras ,",
    "this coupling is about twice the coupling in crse . in the zinc - blende structure the nearest surrounding of a cr atom is formed by 4 @xmath6 atoms .",
    "the second - nearest coordination sphere contains cr atoms .",
    "although the exchange interaction cr-@xmath6 atom is antiferromagnetic it makes the parallel directions of the cr moments energetically preferable .",
    "therefore the indirect exchange interaction of the cr moments through the @xmath6 atoms stabilizes further the ferromagnetic configuration of the cr moments ( a similar situation was found in full - heusler alloys @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction is short range and involves only the nearest cr atoms .",
    "the influence of the lattice compression is very different for the two systems . in cras",
    ", the compression leads to a small decrease of the exchange constants revealing the robustness of the ferromagnetism of the compound . on the other hand , in crse the effect of the compression",
    "is very strong .",
    "already for the a@xmath49 case where the system is still half - metallic the exchange interaction between the nearest cr atoms is halved with respect to the case of the cds lattice constant .",
    "the interaction between second - nearest cr atoms strongly increases keeping antiferromagnetic character .",
    "this is reflected in a very small calculated curie temperature ( table [ table2 ] ) . when the lattice is further compressed and the fermi level moves into the minority - spin conduction band , the ferromagnetic interaction between the nearest cr atoms almost vanishes whereas the antiferromagnetic interaction between the second nearest cr atoms increases further .",
    "this leads to the instability of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the calculated curie temperatures are collected in table [ table2 ] .",
    "they reflect the properties of the exchange interactions discussed above .",
    "we report two estimations of the curie temperature within the mfa , one with only the cr - cr interactions taken into account and other with both cr - cr and cr-@xmath6 atom interactions considered , and one rpa estimation .    in case i , for both systems",
    "the curie temperature is much higher than the room temperature . for cras , @xmath5 is about twice larger than in crse and exceeds 1000 k. the compression of the lattice leads in the case of cras to a very moderate decrease of the curie temperature . in crse ,",
    "the @xmath5 drops strongly with decreasing lattice parameter becoming negative in case iii revealing the instability of ferromagnetism .",

    "the difference between mfa and rpa estimations is explained by a different weighting of the spin - wave excitations . in the mfa",

    "the last heusler compound studied in this paper is mnc .",
    "this system was predicted to be half - metallic by qian and collaborators @xcite .",
    "first we discuss the results of the calculation with the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant reported by qian et al .",
    "the magnetic properties of mnc differ from the properties of the mn compounds discussed above .",
    "mnc has 11 valence electrons : 6 of majority - spin and 5 minority - spin electrons .",
    "this electron distribution results in a magnetic moment which is much smaller than in the compounds discussed above ( table [ table5 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the other compounds the half - metallic gap is now in the majority - spin channel ( figure [ fig5 ] ) . the majority - spin dos has the following structure : low in energy in the interval [ -0.55 ry,-0.4 ry ] lie @xmath61-states .",
    "above , in the interval [ -0.4 ry,-0.2 ry ] there are three bonding hybrids between the @xmath56 states of c and the @xmath52 states of mn .",
    "this is seen in the atom - projected dos of mnc ( right panel in figure [ fig5 ] ) where both mn and c states have similar contribution in this energy interval .",
    "the group of states next in energy ( interval [ -0.2 ry,-0.05 ry ] ) does not hybridize with the lower states .",
    "these are the mn @xmath57 states separated by a gap from the antibonding c @xmath56-mn @xmath52 hybrids .",
    "the fermi level lies within this gap in the majority - spin dos . for the minority - spin channel",
    ", the position of the fermi level belongs to the region of the @xmath57 states .",
    "these states are shifted by the exchange splitting to higher energies with respect to the corresponding majority - spin states .     and a@xmath50 cases in table [ table5 ] .",
    "right panel : atom- and spin - resolved dos for the half - metallic mnc and mnsi compounds . ]",
    "the comparison of the dos of half - metallic mnc and mnsi ( figure [ fig5 ] ) allows to reveal the reason for the move of the semiconductor - type behavior from the spin - minority channel in mnsi to the spin - majority channel in mnc .",
    "first , the two systems differ by the value of the magnetic moment that leads in the case of mnc to a smaller relative exchange shift of the spin - up and spin - down states and to the occupation of a larger number of the spin - down mn 3@xmath8 states . in particular , the minority - spin @xmath57 states are partly occupied in mnc whereas in mnsi these states lie above the half - metallic gap .",
    "second , there is difference in the position of the @xmath57 states in the hybridizational gap between bonding and antibonding @xmath52-@xmath56 hybrids which in the case of mnsi results in the gap between occupied majority @xmath57 and empty antibonding hybrid states .    to extend the study of mnc to the states with the fermi level lying at the top - edge of the half - metallic gap ( case ii ) and above it ( case iii ) we need in this case to expand the lattice ( table [ table5 ] ) opposite to all systems considered above where the lattice must be compressed .",
    "this difference comes from the move of the semiconductor channel to the majority - spin subsystem .",
    "the expansion of the lattice makes the energy bands narrower and decreases the strength of the @xmath58-@xmath56 hybridization . at the same time",
    "the mn moment increases increasing the exchange splitting between majority and minority states .",
    "these properties lead to increasing occupation of the majority - spin states and the loss of the half - metallicity ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the calculated exchange constants are presented in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the ferromagnetism is stabilized by the direct mn - mn interactions and the mn - c ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "since the mn moment is much smaller than in other compounds the value of the mn - mn exchange interaction is substantially lower ( figure [ fig4 ] ) . on the other hand , in mnc",
    "the first and second nearest mn atoms are characterized by a similar strength of the ferromagnetic exchange interaction while in other systems only the nearest mn atoms interact strongly .",
    "the expansion of the lattice leads to decreasing mn - mn exchange interactions .",
    "the calculated curie temperatures are presented in table [ table5 ] .",
    "the curie temperature of mnc is smaller than in other mn compounds being about 500 k ( it is comparable with the rpa estimation of @xmath5 of mnas ) .",
    "the value of the curie temperature decreases with expansion of the lattice showing again that half - metallicity is favorable for high curie temperature .    ll|ccccc compound & a( ) & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + mnc ",

    "a@xmath50 & 4.27 & & & 346 & 363 & 327 +    a remarkable feature of the calculation for mnc is a very small difference between the @xmath5 values estimated within the mfa and the rpa . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we briefly discussed the reason behind the different values of the curie temperatures estimated within mfa and rpa .",
    "a striking contrast between mnc and the systems considered in the previous sections allows gaining a deeper insight into the physics of the formation of the curie temperature .",
    "we will base our analysis on the comparison of two systems : mnc and mnsi . characterizing the relative difference of the mfa and rpa values of the curie temperature by the relation @xmath73/t_\\mathrm{c}^\\mathrm{rpa}$ ] we get for mnc a small value of 2.5% compared to a large value of 47% in mnsi .    in mfa ,",
    "the curie temperature is determined by an arithmetic average of the magnon energies while in rpa @xmath5 is determined by the harmonic average of the same quantities .",
    "it is an arithmetic property that the mfa estimation is larger than the rpa one or equal to it if all averaged numbers are equal to each other . in terms of magnon energies",
    ", @xmath9 is equal to @xmath10 in the case that the magnon spectrum is dispersion - less : the magnon energy does not depend on the wave vector @xmath28 .     and [ 0 q q ] directions in the brillouin zone .",
    "the vertical broken line shows the brillouin zone boundary for the [ 0 q q ] direction . ]    in figure  [ fig6 ] we plot the frozen ",
    "magnon energies of mnsi and mnc for two selected directions in the reciprocal space .",
    "we see that the mnc curves are flat in the second half of the * q * interval showing here a very weak dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the mnsi curves are much closer to a simple cosinusoidal form with considerable dispersion in this part of the * q * interval .",
    "comparing now the low-*q * parts of the curves we notice that mnc curves lie higher than the mnsi curves .",
    "therefore , the relative contribution of the low - energy magnons to the rpa value of the curie temperature is less important in mnc compared to mnsi .",
    "this combination of features of the wave - vector dependencies of the frozen - magnon energies is responsible for a much smaller difference between the rpa and mfa estimations of the curie temperature in the two cases . since the form of the magnon dispersion",
    "is reflected on the properties of the inter - atomic exchange interactions it is instructive to compare the patterns of the exchange interactions of the two systems .",
    "taking into account that only mn - mn interactions contribute importantly in the curie temperature we will focus on the comparison of these interactions .",
    "the analysis of the mn - mn exchange interactions in mnsi and mnc ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) shows a strong difference between the two systems . in mnsi ,",
    "only the first - neighbor exchange interaction plays important role .",
    "all other interactions are much smaller . on the other hand , in the case of mnc",
    "the second - neighbor interaction is comparable with the first - neighbor one .",
    "the further few interactions though sizable play less important role .",
    "the presence of two first coordination spheres with similar values of the exchange interactions , on the one hand , makes the exchange interaction in mnc more long ranged and , on the other hand , it effectively increases the coordination number of the atoms with leading exchange interaction .",
    "either of these properties leads to a better accuracy of the mfa estimation .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the stability of the ferromagnetism in six transition - metal compounds crystallizing in the zinc - blende structure .",
    "we calculated from first - principles the electronic structure and employed the frozen - magnon approximation to evaluate the exchange parameters and the curie temperature . in the calculation of the curie temperature we used both the mean - field and random - phase approximations .",
    "considering the cras and crse compounds we found in the case of cras a very high curie temperature exceeding 1000 k. the ferromagnetism of cras is stable with respect to the compression of the lattice . on",
    "the other hand crse possesses about two times lower curie temperature which decreases strongly with lattice compression .",
    "the properties of mnsi and mnge are similar to the properties of the isovalent crse while the properties of mnas are similar to the properties of isovalent crse .",
    "mnc presents an interesting case that differs from all other systems studied .",
    "this system is also half - metallic with the half - metallic gap in the majority - spin channel in contrast to other systems where the half - metallic gap is in the minority - spin subsystem .",
    "the curie temperature of mnc was found to be about 500 k.    in all cases considered we found that half - metallicity is favorable for ferromagnetism and leads to an increased curie temperature .",
    "we conclude that two compounds , mnsi and cras , possess properties which make them promising candidates for spintronics applications : large half - metallic gap and high curie temperature .",
