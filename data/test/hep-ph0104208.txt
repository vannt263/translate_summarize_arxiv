    "although heavy quark spectroscopy is now a rather mature subject , a number of interesting issues remain . in particular , the detailed properties of the excitation spectrum of heavy - light mesons ( @xmath6 ) and their light hadronic transitions are yet to be fully understood . experimentally , much of this excitation spectrum remains to be observed .",
    "only the ground state s - waves and a few of the @xmath7 p - waves are presently well established . however , many of these states will be accessible in the present and future b factories : cleo , babar , belle , cdf , d0 , btev and lhc  b. besides furthering our understanding of qcd dynamics , the detailed study of these excited states may have practical benefits .",
    "for example , triggering on excited states may provide an efficient method of same side b tagging in hadron colliders .",
    "tagging is essential to the study of cp violation in the b system .",
    "the theoretical tools available to determine the properties of excited states in heavy - light systems include heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and low energy chiral effective theory  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these tools are not sufficient to determine the detailed properties of these states .",
    "lattice gauge theory is the only existing technique which allows the systematic study of all the aspects of qcd in heavy - light systems .",
    "detailed studies of the p - wave excited heavy - light states within the quenched approximation already exist  @xcite .",
    "future lattice studies will provide more insight into the nature of qcd dynamics as well as the masses and static properties of heavy - light hadrons .",
    "it is clear that a model to estimate the hadronic transitions from excited state to ground states would also be very useful .",
    "such a formalism has been developed and applied extensively to transitions in heavy - heavy @xmath8 systems  @xcite .",
    "however , heavy - light mesons are more difficult because the light quark is subject to the full nonperturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "one possible approach to providing a framework for these hadronic transitions is to use the chiral quark model  @xcite .",
    "this has been suggested by goity and roberts  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we closely follow the work done in refs .",
    "@xcite . to compute the masses and wavefunctions of the excited states we use a dirac equation for the light quark in the potential generated by the heavy quark (",
    "including first order corrections in the heavy quark expansion and mixing effects ) .",
    "we then use these masses and wavefunctions to compute the hadronic decay amplitudes of excited heavy mesons in the context of a chiral quark model  @xcite .",
    "the main differences between the present and preceding works are in the choice for the parameters of the chromoelectric potential and in the inclusion of mixing effects both in the spectrum and in the decay amplitudes .",
    "moreover we use our results for the radial wavefunctions of the excited mesons to make a comparison with recent lattice results . from the comparison",
    "we extract an estimation for @xmath9 , the effective coupling of the quark to the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we find @xmath10    we present numerical results for the low - lying spectrum ( excited states up to the 3s states ) .",
    "we also compute the pseudoscalar meson hadronic transitions for these states as a function of the chiral quark model effective coupling constant . comparing our results with recent experimental width measurements we estimate this effective coupling @xmath5 .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss our determination of the spectrum of excited states .",
    "our notation , the choice of the potential , inclusion of mixing and other order @xmath11 corrections are explained .",
    "details of the masses and wavefunctions are presented for the low - lying excitation spectrum .",
    "comparison is made with present experimental data .",
    "our treatment of hadronic decays is described in section 3 .",
    "the analytic results are summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ amplitude]-[use_amplitude ] ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the coupling coefficients appearing in these equations are given in appendix  a. also in section 3 , details of the partial rates for the 1s and 1p states in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems are presented .",
    "again comparison is made with present experimental data .",
    "a complete list of remaining results for masses and partial decay widths is reported in appendix  b.",
    "the general hamiltonian of the heavy - light system can be expanded in powers of ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 however , even within the heavy quark limit , the general form of the zeroth order hamiltonian , @xmath13 , still involves the full nonperturbative qcd dynamics for the remaining degrees of freedom ( including light quark pair creation and gluonic degrees of freedom ) . at present",
    "it can not be solved analytically .",
    "we are forced to resort to use a relativistic potential model for @xmath13 .",
    "we model the most general heavy - light meson ( in the @xmath14 family ) , h , as a bound state of a light quark ( @xmath15 ) and a heavy quark ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the heavy quark is treated as a static source of chromoelectric field and the only quantum number associated with it is its spin .",
    "the light quark is treated relativistically and its state is described by the wavefunction @xmath17 . in analogy with the hydrogen atom , we introduce the following quantum numbers :    * @xmath18 , the number associated with the radial excitations ; * @xmath19 , the orbital angular momentum ; * @xmath20 , the total angular momentum of the light quark ; * @xmath21 , the component of @xmath20 along the @xmath22 axis ; * @xmath23 , the total angular momentum of the system ; * @xmath24 , the component of @xmath23 along the @xmath22 axis ; * @xmath25 , the spin of the heavy quark along the @xmath22 axis ;    the parameters of our model are the masses of the light quarks ( @xmath26 for @xmath27 ) , the masses of the heavy quarks ( @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) and the chromoelectric potential of the heavy quark ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the total wavefunction of the system can be decomposed as follows    @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the usual clebsh - gordan coefficients and @xmath33 is a two component spinor representing the heavy quark .",

    "( [ notation0 ] ) introducing the most general parameterization for the four spin components of the light quark wavefunction    @xmath36    here @xmath37 are spherical harmonics that encode the angular dependence while @xmath38 , @xmath39 are real functions that encode that radial dependence . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are fixed , up to an overall phase , by imposing a normalization condition .",
    "our choice of the phase is such that @xmath42      within our basic framework , @xmath43 is given by the relativistic dirac hamiltonian @xmath44 and the rotational - invariant potential is the sum of a constant factor ( @xmath45 ) , a scalar part ( @xmath46 ) and ( the zeroth component of ) a vector part ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 the constant @xmath45 is a an overall energy shift that depends on the heavy quark flavor and , in general , it is not equal to @xmath28 , as often assumed in the literature .",
    "for this reason we consider @xmath28 and @xmath49 two independent parameters of the model .",
    "asymptotic freedom suggests that at short distances the potential is dominated by a vector part that asymptotically approaches a coulomb potential , @xmath50 . on the other hand lattice simulations",
    "indicate that at large distances the potential is confining , scalar and asymptotically linear , @xmath51 .",
    "the naive assumption about a short distance coulomb - like divergent behavior of the potential is doomed because it gives rise to ultraviolet divergences ( as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . it",
    "this context the divergence arises in the @xmath11 correction to the energy and it is due to the inconsistency of a static point - like source ( the heavy quark ) within a relativistic framework .",
    "one solution is assuming that the heavy quark is static but not point - like , therefore the potential that it generates is a convolution of the coulomb - like potential and the square of the heavy quark wavefunction ( peaked around the center of mass of the system and smeared within some small length scale @xmath52 ) .    more generally , one is allowed to cure this divergence by regulating the potential close to the origin ( on a length scale of the order @xmath52 ) .",
    "different choices for the regulator are allowed and they do not affect the physics we want to describe , providing that @xmath52 is small enough .",
    "the values of the parameters that appear in the hamiltonian , on the contrary , depend on this choice since they run with @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , to obtain the same spectrum , different choices for the regulator imply different fitting parameters .",
    "we chose to regulate the vector potential by assuming a gaussian shape for the wavefunction of the heavy quark , @xmath54 , and with this choice @xmath55 for the scalar potential we assume a simple linear form @xmath56 we observe that @xmath57 is not a physical parameter since it can be absorbed into the definition of @xmath26 .",
    "for this reason @xmath57 will be omitted from now on .",
    "summarizing , the nine parameters of our model are @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are mass parameters for the light @xmath61 and @xmath62 quarks respectively , equivalent to constituent quark masses shifted by the constant amount @xmath57 of eq .",

    "* the hyperfine splitting @xmath81      in eqs.([e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) we assumed that the hamiltonian was diagonal .",

    "can mix any states with the same total angular momentum , @xmath23 , and parity , @xmath83 , however , there are only two types of sizable mixings .",
    "large mixing can occur for pairs of states @xmath84 and @xmath85 with : ( 1 ) @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( i.e. mixing within a given @xmath18 and @xmath89 multiplet ) ; or ( 2 ) @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath88 ( e.g. s - d mixing ) .",

    "we have computed the spectrum and hadronic decay width of the excited @xmath96 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath1 mesons using a relativistic quark model for the masses and wavefunction of the heavy - light mesons .",
    "this work is based on that of refs .",
    "@xcite but departs from these previous works because we choose a simpler form for the potential and determined its parameters exclusively from fitting the experimental heavy - light spectrum .",
    "moreover we computed all corrections within the model to order @xmath11 , including mixing between nearby states with the same @xmath105 .",
    "our spectrum results agree very well with the existing data in the @xmath96 and @xmath103 systems .",
    "the agreement in the @xmath104 and @xmath1 systems is also fairly good but the experimental situation for the p states is not yet completely resolved .",
    "for example , our model predicts a spin - orbit inversion for the excited p - wave states in these systems .",
    "this agrees with the recent cleo  @xcite results for the @xmath96 mesons ; but is in disagreement with preliminary l3 results  @xcite for the @xmath104 mesons .",
    "however , in our model we find that the splitting between the @xmath106 p - wave states ( @xmath107 ) more than twice as large as the splitting of the @xmath108 p - wave states ( @xmath109 ) . which is inconsistent with the assumption of equal splitting used by @xmath110  @xcite in their analysis .    the information on the spectrum and the wavefunction was used to compute a complete list of allowed hadronic decays for these excited mesons into lower energy states with emission of a light pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 or @xmath113 ) and their relative branching ratios .",
    "we also compared our model prediction for @xmath114 with lattice results .",
    "we find good agreement between the shapes of the decay amplitudes .",
    "we used this comparison to extract a preliminary lattice determination of @xmath9 , the effective coupling of the chiral quark model .",
    "we find the value @xmath10 .",
    "using this value for @xmath9 to translate the total hadronic decay widths in physical units , we would conclude that the widths of the @xmath96 meson @xmath83 waves are consistently below experimental findings .",
    "of course , the lattice results have not yet been extrapolated to the continuum .",
    "comparison of our results with a recent experiment measurement of the @xmath115 width  @xcite yields @xmath5 . using this value , we find much better overall agreement with experimental findings .",
    "finally , there is also a whole set of hadronic decays with emission of light vector mesons which we did not include in our study . for the higher excited states these transitions give an important contribution to the total physical widths .",
