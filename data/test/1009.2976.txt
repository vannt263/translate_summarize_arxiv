    "in this contribution we aim at shedding some light , from the perturbative standpoint , on the origin of loop contributions to the beta function of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theories .",
    "we employ an automatically invariant , four dimensional ( minimal ) framework in which neither ward identities need to be imposed as constraint equations nor modifications in the original physical lagrangian are performed .",
    "furthermore both finite and divergent parts of the feynman amplitudes are displayed which is particularly useful to discuss the subtleties involved in the corrections of the beta function beyond one loop order in this model as we shall discuss later on .",
    "the beta function of sym theory has been a subject of controversy in both non - perturbative and perturbative calculations .",
    "one of the debates has been named  anomaly puzzle \" . because the @xmath1 current is in the same multiplet as the trace of the energy momentum tensor , chiral anomaly and trace anomaly are equally subjected to the adler - bardeen theorem @xcite . as the beta function is proportional to the trace of the energy momentum tensor",
    ", one could assert on general grounds that contributions beyond one loop order were zero . on the other hand novikov , shifman , vainshtein and zakharov ( nsvz )",
    "were the first to obtain an exact expression for the beta function @xcite .",
    "in addition , perturbative calculations using dimensional reduction @xcite revealed higher loop contributions to the beta function .",
    "other regularization methods have obtained corrections beyond one loop as well @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "arkani - hamed and murayama @xcite have shed some light on the anomaly puzzle providing a simple and elegant explanation .",
    "they have shown that the vector multiplet does not have canonical kinetic terms after dilations ( trace anomaly ) which can only appear after an additional rescaling is performed .",
    "hence the anomaly from this modified dilation will no longer belong to the same multiplet as the @xmath1 anomaly . as a result ,",
    "the beta function corrections are not constrained by the adler bardeen theorem . however",
    ", some controversies remain @xcite .",
    "the other controversy on this matter concerns the possible infrared mode contributions to the beta function which again affects both non - perturbative and perturbative calculations .",
    "nsvz @xcite derived the exact beta function in a framework based on instanton analysis which borne out its infrared origin .",
    "contrariwise , arkani - hamed and murayama @xcite claim , within a purely wilsonian framework freed from infrared subtleties , that the exact beta function depends only on ultraviolet properties of the theory .",
    "this discussion also appears in a perturbative analysis . within the supergraph approach to supersymmetric models , along with on - shell infrared divergences of yang - mills theory , additional off - shell infrared divergences appear @xcite which must be _ consistently _ separated from ultraviolet ones before renormalization is effected .",
    "the unclear distinction between these two types of infinities is at the heart of this debate .",
    "the answer to this matter passes through an unambiguous distinction between the infinities involved and the arbitrary scales which are byproducts of the subtractions . in dimensional reduction",
    "@xcite,@xcite the two loop correction to the beta function appears from a local evanescent operator typical of the method .",
    "such operator is absent should the calculation stay in the physical space - time dimension .",
    "therefore grisaru , milewski and zanon themselves conjectured that no divergence should occur beyond one loop .",
    "this is correct as we verify later in this contribution .",
    "however it does not mean that the two loop beta function vanishes but instead that the naive perturbative derivation of the beta function based on renormalization constants needs some reinterpretation and modification .",
    "such modification appears to be related to scaling anomalies @xcite .",
    "it is important to observe that in dimensional regularizations the treatment of amplitudes which are simultaneously infrared and ultraviolet divergent is involved because they can be mixed .",
    "mas , perez - victoria and seijas have evaluated the two loop contribution within differential renormalization @xcite which does not recourse to a dimensional extension on the space - time dimension . in this framework",
    "no infinities appear by construction .",
    "they claim that the beta function two loop correction depends on infrared divergences yet the latter is seen as playing a passive role .",
    "we believe that a calculation in which 1 ) no dimensional continuation on space - time is performed ; 2 ) infrared and ultraviolet divergences decouple clearly ; 3 ) one distinguishes the corresponding scales without the need of introducing extra parameters to ensure their independence ; 4 ) gauge and supersymmetry invariance are maintained at every loop order ; 5 ) only one renormalization scale appears as divergences are subtracted and 6 ) one can keep track of both finite and infinite parts of the amplitude , can shed more light on the perturbative analysis of this problem .",
    "implicit regularization is a good candidate for such a task .",
    "it has been proved to be invariant to all orders if well known surface terms are set to zero which is closely related to momentum routing invariance in the feynman diagrams @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "ultraviolet infinities need not be evaluated and remain as a systematic set of basic divergent integrals which depend upon a unique renormalization scale @xmath2",
    ". their derivatives with respect to that scale are also basic divergent integrals .",
    "off - shell infrared infinities can be likewise defined save that the basic divergent integrals depend on an infrared arbitrary scale which is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it was shown that implicit regularization complies with locality , unitarity and lorentz invariance because the bogoliubov s recursion relations which locally executes the forest formula to subtract general subdivergences can be implemented in such a scheme .    in the present contribution",
    "we calculate the two loop beta function of @xmath0 super yang - mills theory in an ultraviolet and off - shell infrared regularization independent way in the framework of implicit regularization .",
    "we verified in our calculation at two loop order the conjecture by grisaru , milewski and zanon @xcite that after subtraction of subdivergences no ultraviolet infinities occur beyond one loop in n=1 super yang - mills when space - time dimension is not modified .",
    "more importantly we conclude that the two first terms in the loop expansion of the beta function receive contributions related to on - shell infrared divergences .",
    "consider the standard pure @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills classical action @xcite , @xcite @xmath3 we work with the supersymmetric background field method where gauge invariance is kept manifest .",
    "the one loop contributions depicted by the diagrams of figure 1 read , after performing supersymmetric algebra , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a gauge parameter and the tilde indicates the fourier transform . the superscripts @xmath6 indicate that the integrals are implicitly regularized in the ultraviolet and infrared limits so to allow for algebraic manipulations with the integrand . hereafter , for brevity",
    ", we adopt the notation @xmath7 .        by simple power counting",
    "we conclude that the first integral in @xmath8 is only ultraviolet divergent while the second one is only infrared divergent . in order to avoid as long as possible contact with infrared regularization schemes",
    "we leave the infrared integrals in their original form assuming an adequate regulator that allows for algebraic manipulations . in the appendix",
    "we specify two concrete infrared regularizations .",
    "we can write @xmath9 in terms of the classical action after integrating over half of the supercoordinates , to obtain @xmath10 where we have defined for later use @xmath11    the ultraviolet divergent integral @xmath12 can be written in the convenient form using implicit regularization ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath2 is a nonvanishing arbitrary parameter which plays the role of renormalization group scale and @xmath15 is a one loop basic divergent integral.th loop order the basic divergent integrals are written as powers up to @xmath16 of @xmath17 and @xmath18/(k^2-\\lambda^2)^2 $ ] @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",

    "they are obviously independent by construction .",
    "moreover one can easily check that @xmath56 which guarantees the independence of the scales @xmath2 and @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the operation that subtracts off - shell infrared infinities .",
    "we leave the off - shell infrared divergences ( implicitly regularized ) represented by @xmath51 and @xmath54 in an integral form to show explicitly that they play no role in the evaluation of the beta function .",
    "@xmath59 obeys the renormalization group equation : should be added in ( [ renorm ] ) , @xmath57 being the infrared scale . ] @xmath60 using @xmath61 @xcite and ( [ final ] ) we can solve the above equation for @xmath62 .",
    "writing @xmath63 we find @xmath64.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{betadois}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the second term on the right hand side of ( [ betadois ] ) comes from the term proportional to @xmath65 of the last line of ( [ final ] ) .",
    "the terms @xmath54 and @xmath51 are separately off - shell infrared divergent .",
    "however @xmath66 independently of the infrared regulator and thus @xmath67 it is important to note that such cancelation does not depend on the infrared regularization and since just @xmath54 and @xmath51 are ( off - shell ) infrared divergent the two first universal coefficients of the beta function are independent of off - shell infrared infinities .",
    "indeed in the appendix we explicitly evaluate the integrals @xmath51 and @xmath54 in two different infrared regularizations showing such cancelation . the above beta function",
    "coefficients agree with the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we used , we believe for the first time , a four dimensional invariant framework in which gauge and supersymmetry invariance are _ automatically _ maintained , and both finite and infinite parts of the amplitudes are made explicit throughout the calculation , without any modification to the original effective action ( i.e. with the simplest feynman rules ) , to study the loop contributions to the beta function of @xmath0 sym theory . in the feynman gauge , along with on - shell infrared divergences , additional off - shell divergences appear as expected @xcite ; they must be carefully dealt with , in a way that they do not get mixed with ultraviolet ones .",
    "this is achieved through the identification of distinct scales in connection with the @xmath68 and/or @xmath58 operations .",
    "as conjectured in @xcite for four dimensional invariant methods , we verified within our framework that after subdivergences are subtracted , no overall ultraviolet divergences survive at two loop order . however the beta function does not vanish as calculated with the finite part of the amplitude which obeys a regular renormalization group equation .    as it becomes clear from our equation ( [ betadois ] ) , off - shell infrared divergences cancel out automatically in a ( off - shell infrared ) regularization independent fashion ( that is to say , no @xmath58 operation is necessary ) and hence there is no contribution whatsoever stemming from them .",
    "we have explicitly verified within two off - shell infrared regularization frameworks the cancelation of the first and third term in ( [ betadois ] ) using in one case a dual version of implicit regularization in coordinate space and in the other case a simple fictitious mass in the propagators ( see appendix ) .",
    "however the term in the middle , proportional to @xmath69 , stems from the derivative of a non local on - shell infrared divergence proportional to @xmath65 which multiplies the @xmath70 fields and is integrated over the whole @xmath71 four dimensional space .",
    "therefore it becomes apparent that ( on - shell ) infrared modes contribute to the two loop beta function .",
    "this is somewhat not surprising as it may happen in other supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a naive perturbative derivation of the beta function from renormalization constants must be modified taking into account the presence of the rescaling anomalies discussed in @xcite .",
    "our approach reveals itself as very adequate for such analysis .",
