    "at the cern large hardon collider we hope to uncover the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and to find signals of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "signal events have to be dug out from a bulk of background events , which are due to the standard model processes , mostly qcd processes accompanied by additional electroweak bosons .",
    "these constitute of final states with a high number of jets or identified particles .",
    "lhc data can only be meaningfully analyzed if a plethora of standard model background processes are theoretically under control .",
    "if one is content with a leading order description of the multijets final states it is possible to go to quite high orders , say 8 - 10 particles in the final states , which have to be well separated to avoid phase space regions where divergences become troublesome .",
    "quite a number of tools enable one to do this : alpgen @xcite , amegic++/sherpa @xcite , comix / sherpa @xcite , comphep @xcite , helac - phegas @xcite , madgraph / madevent @xcite and omega / whizard @xcite .",
    "those tools , which are based on feynman diagrams suffer from inefficiency at large n , where n is a number of particles , because the number of diagrams to be evaluated grows rapidly as n increases .",
    "some of the tools above use methods designed to be particularly efficient at high multiplicities .",
    "namely , they build up amplitudes for complex processes using off - shell recursive methods . nevertheless , all these tools are completely self contained and provide amplitudes and integrators on their own .",
    "although multijet observables can rather easily be modeled at leading order , this description suffers several drawbacks .",
    "leading order calculations depend strongly on the renormalisation scale and can therefore give only an order of magnitude estimate on absolute rates . besides normalization ,",
    "sometimes also shapes of distributions are first known at higher orders .",
    "secondly , for many scale processes like _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 , a proper scale choice is problematic .",
    "for some observables dynamical scales seem to work better , for others fixed scales are applied .",
    "how do we know which scale to choose ?",
    "moreover , at leading order a jet is modeled by a single parton , which is a very crude approximation .",
    "the situation can significantly be improved by including higher order corrections in perturbation theory .",
    "next - to - leading order programs can be divided into three categories .",
    "libraries with a specific list of processes at hadron - hadron colliders like _ e.g. _ mcfm for processes with heavy quarks and/or heavy electroweak bosons , nlojets++znagy / site / nlojet++.html ] @xcite for jet production and vbfnlovbfnloweb/ ] @xcite for vector - boson fusion processes .",
    "automatic tools based on passarino - veltman @xcite reduction of one - loop amplitudes for general @xmath9 processes like _",
    "e.g. _ feynarts / formcalc / looptools @xcite and golem @xcite . and",
    "finally , automatic tools based on opp reduction and other unitarity - based methods , which aim at multiparticle processes at hadron colliders like blackhat / sherpa , rocket / mcfm and helac - nlo . thanks to all these methods and developments several @xmath10 processes have recently been calculated at next - to - leading order qcd , including @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 production via weak - boson fusion @xcite , qcd - mediated @xmath17 process @xcite , and finally @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the first @xmath19 process @xmath20 @xcite has recently been calculated in the leading - color approximation .    in this contribution , a brief report on the helac - nlo approach and the @xmath14 computation is given .",
    "the next - to - leading order results are obtained in the framework of helac - nlo based on the helac - phegas leading - order event generator for all parton level , which has , on its own , already been extensively used and tested in phenomenological studies see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "the integration over the fractions @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the initial partons is optimized with the help of parni @xcite .",
    "the phase space integration is executed with the help of kaleu @xcite and cross checked with phegas @xcite , both general purpose multi - channel phase space generators .",
    "the next - to - leading order system consists of :    1 .",
    "cuttoolspittau / cuttools/ ] @xcite , for the opp reduction of tensor integrals with a given numerator to a basis of scalar functions and for the rational parts @xcite ; 2 .",
    "@xcite for the evaluation of one loop amplitude , more specifically for the evaluation of the numerator functions for given loop momentum ( fixed by cuttools ) ; 3 .",
    "oneloop @xcite , a library of scalar functions , which provides the actual numerical values of the integrals .",
    "helac - dipoles @xcite , automatic implementation of catani - seymour dipole subtraction @xcite , for the calculation of the real emission part .",
    "let us emphasize that all parts are calculated fully numerically in a completely automatic manner .",

    "[ fig : ttjj]_,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we consider proton - proton collisions at the lhc with a center of mass energy of @xmath27 tev .",
    "the mass of the top quark is set to be @xmath28 gev .",
    "we leave it on - shell with unrestricted kinematics .",
    "the jets are defined by at most two partons using the @xmath29 algorithm @xcite , with a separation @xmath30 , where @xmath31\\ ] ] being the rapidity and @xmath32 the azimuthal angle of parton @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the recombination is only performed if both partons satisfy @xmath34 ( approximate detector bounds ) .",
    "we further assume that the jets are separated by @xmath35 and have @xmath36 .",
    "their transverse momentum is required to be larger than @xmath37 gev .",
    "we consistently use the cteq6 set of parton distribution functions @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ we take cteq6l1 pdfs with a 1-loop running @xmath38 in leading order and cteq6 m pdfs with a 2-loop running @xmath38 at next - to - leading order .",
    "we begin our presentation of the final results of our analysis with a discussion of the total cross section . for the central value of the scale , @xmath39 ,",
    "we have obtained : @xmath40 from the above result one can read a @xmath41 factor @xmath42 which corresponds to the negative corrections of the order of @xmath43 .",
    "the scale dependence of the corrections is illustrated in figure [ fig : scales ] .",
    "we observe a dramatic reduction of the scale uncertainty while going from leading order to next - to - leading order .",
    "varying the scale up and down by a factor 2 changes the cross section by @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the leading order case , while in the next - to - leading order case we have obtained a variation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the third jet , which stems from real radiation , has not been restricted in this case .",
    "therefore , in the next step , we study the impact of a jet veto on the third jet , which is simply an upper bound on the allowed transverse momentum , @xmath48 .",
    "the total cross section with a jet veto of 50 gev is @xmath49 which corresponds to @xmath50 and negative corrections of the order of @xmath51 . in this case",
    "a scale variation of @xmath52 and @xmath53 has been reached , see figure [ fig : scales ] for graphical representation .    while the size of the corrections to the total cross section is certainly interesting , it is crucial to study the corrections to the distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig : ttjj ] the transverse momentum distributions of the hardest and second hardest jet are shown for the @xmath54 process .",
    "the blue dashed curve corresponds to the leading order , whereas the red solid one to the next - to - leading order result .",
    "the histograms can also be turned into dynamical k - factors , which we display in the lower panels .",
    "distributions demonstrate tiny corrections up to at least 200 gev , which means that the size of the corrections to the cross section is transmitted to the distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "strongly altered shapes are visible at high @xmath48 especially in case of the first hardest jet .",
    "let us underline here , that corrections to the high @xmath48 region can only be correctly described by higher order calculations and are not altered by soft - collinear emissions simulated by parton showers .",
    "we report the results of a next - to - leading order simulation of top quark pair production in association with two jets . with our inclusive cuts ,",
    "we show that the corrections with respect to leading order are negative and small , reaching @xmath43 .",
    "the error obtained by scale variation is of the same order .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the international symposium on multiparticle dynamics for the kind invitation and the very pleasant atmosphere during the conference .",
