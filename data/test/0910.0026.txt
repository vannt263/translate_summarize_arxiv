    "it is well known that when a liquid is disturbed suddenly from its equilibrium state by changing the temperature or pressure of the surrounding medium , or both , then the liquid undergoes a rapid , solidlike change , followed by a slower , liquidlike change towards the new equilibrium state .",
    "these changes can be seen in the variation in its thermodynamic properties such as the volume @xmath0 or its enthalpy @xmath1 with time . for a supercooled liquid , the above scenario plays an important role .",
    "as the temperature is lowered or the pressure is increased , the scale separation between the fast and the slow processes in supercooled liquids increases until the latter becomes too large compared to the experimental observation time @xmath2 . in this case , the system is said to be kinetically arrested in that the liquidlike changes no longer contribute to the observed properties .",
    "the system behaves like a solid and is called a _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the glass is a system that may be far from equilibrium so one can not apply equilibrium statistical mechanics to investigate its properties , which vary with time .",
    "one must resort to apply non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , not a well - established field at present , to study glasses and their relaxation in time ; the latter are usually known as _",
    "structural relaxation_. it is known from the early work of littleton @xcite , and lillie @xcite that the isothermal viscosity of a glass changes during relaxation , thus implying the dependence of the relaxation on changes in the state of the glass @xcite . the most general framework for developing non - equilibrium thermodynamics must satisfy the second law of thermodynamics or must start from it .",
    "the generality arises since the second law is independent of the processes ( structural or otherwise ) going inside the system .",
    "it is also independent of the details of the system considered and does not requires any sophisticated concepts like ergodicity or its loss , etc .",
    "our main goal in this work is to develop an appropriate non - equilibrium thermodynamics , which will then be applied to glasses with the hope to gain some new insight and to clarify at the fundamental level certain concepts extensively used in glasses .    glassy behavior and their properties",
    "have been extensively studied and usually explained by invoking empirical rules @xcite that , although they have proved invaluable and very reliable , lack theoretical justifications @xcite .",
    "only recently , attempts have been made @xcite that use modern framework to investigate non - equilibrium properties of glassy relaxation at the molecular level .",
    "our treatment here differs from these attempts in that we develop our approach using the second law that should be applicable to all systems including glasses .",
    "we do not derive the actual laws of relaxation for which one must turn to other sources such as @xcite .",
    "our goal is quite different .",
    "we wish to understand some of the important concepts used for glasses at a fundamental level .",
    "one of the most widely used concept in this field is that of the _ fictive temperature _",
    ", first introduced by tool @xcite in an empirical fashion to describe non - linear relaxation in glasses .",
    "the system under study slows down so much upon reducing the temperature from its initial value @xmath3 , where the system was in equilibrium , to some temperature @xmath4  that one has to wait for a very long time before true equilibrium is reached at the final temperature . in this case , crudely speaking , the glass properties are assumed to be similar to a fictive liquid at some intermediate temperature between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as time goes on and as the system undergoes structural rearrangements to come to equilibrium , the temperature of the system continues to change and finally becomes @xmath4 .",
    "this already means that the fictive temperature of the system continuously changes from @xmath3  to @xmath4 . despite its continual usage in the field , the true meaning of the fictive temperature , though phenomenologically obvious",
    ", is not well - defined in terms of fundamental quantities such as the entropy . in particular",
    ", there exists a variety of fictive temperatures , each associated with the relaxing quantity under investigation , which makes the concept not very rich .",
    "there is another aspect of structural relaxation .",
    "its presence means that the glass is a non - equilibrium state .",
    "thus , its temperature must be changing during the process of relaxation .",
    "how does one define the _ instantaneous temperature _ of the liquid ?",
    "the instantaneous temperature itself must relax to @xmath4  as time goes on . thus , there will a relaxation time describing the relaxation of the temperature of the glass .",
    "tool @xcite and narayanaswamy @xcite , among others , observed that the relaxation time not only depends upon the temperature @xmath4 , but also depends upon the fictive temperature of the system ; see for example @xcite .",
    "is the instantaneous temperature of the glass the same as the fictive temperature ?",
    "these are important issues as a deeper understanding of these concepts will provide a more qualitative and predictive understanding of glass transition .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we consider an isolated system consisting of the system of interest surrounded by a very large medium and follow the consequences of it in the next section . in sect .",
    "[ marker_internal_equilibrium ] , we follow the consequence of partial equilibrium to develop a very general non - equilibrium thermodynamics , which is then applied to a glass in sect .",
    "[ sec.local_equilibrium ] .",
    "the concept of the fictive temperature and the tool - narayanaswamy phenomenology are considered in sect .",
    "[ marker_fictive ] , and established on a firm theoretical ground .",
    "the conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "as said above , we study non - equilibrium systems by proceeding in a general manner by following the consequences of the second law , which is well established . as usual",
    ", we apply the second law to an isolated system , which we denote by @xmath5 ; it  consists of the system @xmath6 of interest ( such as our glass ) in a medium denoted by @xmath7 containing it . we will consider a single component system , which is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "according to the second law , the entropy @xmath8 of an isolated system @xmath5 can never decrease in time @xcite:@xmath9 what happens inside the isolated system ( loss of ergodicity in parts of the system , chemical reactions , phase changes , etc . ) can not affect the direction of the inequality , which makes it the most general principle of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the law itself imposes no restriction on the actual rate of entropy change . in general",
    ", @xmath8 also depends on the number of particles @xmath10 , energy @xmath11 , and volume @xmath12 of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 used above should be really written as @xmath14 .",
    "however , as the extensive quantities remain constant in time there is no harm in using the compact form @xmath13 during approach to equilibrium .",
    "the entropy @xmath13 is a _ continuous _ function of each of its arguments .",
    "the energy , volume and the number of particles of @xmath15  are denoted by @xmath16 , @xmath0 , and @xmath17 respectively , while that of the medium @xmath7 by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 obviously,@xmath21 we will assume that @xmath22 of the system is also fixed , which means that @xmath23 is also fixed .",
    "however , the energy and volume of the system may change with @xmath24 .",
    "when the isolated system is in equilibrium , its entropy @xmath14 has reached its maximum and no longer has any _ explicit _ time - dependence so that it can be simply written as @xmath25 or @xmath8 . in this case ,",
    "different parts of @xmath5  have the same temperature @xmath4 and pressure @xmath26:@xmath27 we have defined the temperature by setting the boltzmann constant @xmath28 in this work .",
    "otherwise , the entropy @xmath13 _ continuously increases _ and the isolated system is said to be not in equilibrium .",
    "the medium is considered to be very large compared to @xmath29 so that its temperature , pressure , etc . are not affected by the system .",
    "we assume @xmath7 to be in internal equilibrium ( its different parts have the same temperature and pressure , but @xmath7 and @xmath6 may not be in equilibrium with each other ) .",
    "thus , its entropy @xmath30 no longer has an explicit time dependence , but has an _ implicit _ @xmath24-dependence through the @xmath24-dependence of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the time variation of @xmath13 is due to the relaxation going on inside @xmath6 as it is driven towards equilibrium with the medium .",
    "the entropy @xmath13 of the isolated system can be written as the sum of the entropies @xmath31 of the system and @xmath32 of the medium:@xmath33 there is no explicit @xmath24-dependence in @xmath34 due to internal equilibrium .",
    "the correction to this entropy due to the weak stochastic interactions between the system and the medium has been neglected , which is a common practice @xcite .",
    "we expand @xmath8 in terms of the small quantities of the system @xcite@xmath35 it follows from the internal equilibrium of @xmath7 that@xmath36 and @xmath37 which is a constant , is independent of the system .",
    "thus,@xmath38    let us introduce @xmath39 the time - dependent gibbs  free energy and enthalpy of the system @xmath6 with the medium @xmath7 at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath26 .",
    "we thus finally have @xmath40 so that the behavior ( [ second_law ] ) of @xmath13  of the isolated system leads to an very important conclusion about the gibbs free energy of the system : @xmath41 the gibbs free energy @xmath42 decreases as the system relaxes towards equilibrium , a result quite well known .",
    "if we abruptly cool the system from some previous temperature such as @xmath43 to a lower temperature , the gibbs free energy at the new temperature remains equal to its value at the previous temperature at time @xmath44 .",
    "as it relaxes , @xmath42 continuously decreases .",
    "it can not increase without violating the second law .",
    "we have given the essential steps in its derivation here not only for the sake of continuity as some of the intermediate steps will be needed later on , but also to make some important points , which we now list .    1 .   in deriving the above equation ( [ gibbs_free_energy_entropy_relation ] ) , no assumption about the system @xmath6 has been made . in particular ,",
    "we have not assumed any particular aspect of its non - equilibrium nature , such as a particular form of relaxation ( arrhenius or otherwise ) , loss of ergodicity , etc .",
    "the identification of @xmath45 with the gibbs free energy @xmath42 of @xmath6 is generally valid under the assumption of the medium being large compared to @xmath6 , which can be satisfied as well as we wish .",
    "the gibbs free energy @xmath42 and the enthalpy @xmath46 are determined by the temperature @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath26 of the large medium .",
    "the continuity of @xmath13 with respect to all of its arguments that was mentioned earlier also applies to the gibbs free energy of the system .",
    "the decrease in @xmath42 must not be violated even when there is a loss of ergodicity in the system , as is commonly believed to occur in a glass transition .",
    "6 .   for glasses",
    ", we have an additional experimental fact .",
    "the enthalpy remains continuous across the glass transition .",
    "the continuity of the enthalpy then implies that the entropy @xmath31 also will remain continuous with respect to all of its arguments , as the system relaxes .",
    "this allows us to differentiate the entropy , which will be required in sect .",
    "[ marker_internal_equilibrium ] .",
    "when the equality in ( [ second_law ] ) occurs , different parts of @xmath47  ( such as @xmath6  and @xmath7 )  have the same temperature @xmath4 and pressure @xmath26 .",
    "otherwise , they have different temperatures and pressures , in which case a common assumption made by almost all workers is that of partial equilibrium ( see , for example , landau and lifshitz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see p. 13 ) ) when @xmath5 is out of equilibrium ; each part is in _ internal equilibrium _",
    "( local equilibrium ) , which then allows us to define the temperature , pressure , etc . for each part , which may all be different .",
    "in this situation , their entropies have the maximum possible values for their respective energies and volumes , and the number of particles . as a result",
    ", they have no explicit @xmath24-dependence [ see the equilibrium condition ( [ eq_conds_0 ] ) above for @xmath5 ] ; their variation in time comes from the time variation of their energies , volumes , etc .",
    "the entropy @xmath49 of the system determines its instantaneous temperature @xmath50 and pressure @xmath51:@xmath52 these are standard relations for the entropy @xcite , except that all quantities except @xmath49 in the above equations may have an _ explicit _ dependence on time @xmath24 that will make @xmath49 depend _ implicitly _ on time .",
    "accordingly , @xmath53 under internal equilibrium . relations like ( [ eq_conds ] ) along with ( [ eq_conds_t ] ) for internal equilibrium are used commonly in non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "for example , we use them to establish that heat flows from a hot body to a cold body ; see for example sect . 9 in landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "the glassy state , in which the fast dynamics has equilibrated and the slow dynamics is extremely slow , will thus be treated as a state in internal equilibrium , although it is not in equilibrium ( with the medium ) . *",

    "they become identical . below",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath79 becomes larger than @xmath2 , and the system turns into a glass .",

    "it should be noted again that , due to the internal equilibrium of the system , there is no explicit @xmath24-dependence in @xmath49 on the right side of ( [ total_entropy ] ) or ( [ total_subtracted_entropy ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath24-dependence in @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is implicit through @xmath82 and @xmath55 . in the following ,",
    "the glass is considered to be formed under _ isobaric _",
    "conditions so the pressure of the medium is kept fixed at @xmath26 as its temperature is step - wise varied .",
    "accordingly , its instantaneous pressure @xmath51 is always equal to @xmath26 of the medium@xmath83 but its temperature will in general be different than @xmath4 and vary in time , as we will show below .",
    "the initial enthalpy @xmath84 at @xmath4 is the enthalpy of the glass at temperature @xmath3 , and @xmath85 the value of the scl enthalpy after complete relaxation at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it is experimentally found that the enthalpy decreases with time during an isothermal relaxation so that @xmath86 this decrease is a general property of thermodynamics which follows from the specific heat being non - negative . we first consider the case when @xmath3 is the glass transition temperature , so that the system is in the scl state at @xmath3 . as @xmath87",
    "the enthalpy @xmath84 of scl at @xmath88 must be higher than the enthalpy @xmath89 of scl at @xmath4 .",
    "the same is also true of the volume in many cases , which relaxes to a smaller value in an isothermal relaxation .",
    "however , this property of the volume is not a thermodynamic requirement .",
    "accordingly , as a general rule@xmath90 during isothermal structural relaxation in glasses . in the following",
    ", we will only use the above general property of the enthalpy , and not of the volume .",
    "now , if @xmath3 is below the glass transition , then from the result just derived , we conclude that @xmath84 is even larger than the scl enthalpy at @xmath3 .",
    "this even strengthens the above inequality ( [ enthalpy_inequality ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the time derivative of the entropy @xmath8 , which is changing because the energy and volume of @xmath6 are changing with time @xcite .",

    "it is clear that @xmath92 if @xmath93 .",

    "the derivative @xmath94 which by definition  represents the inverse temperature @xmath95 of the system , see ( [ eq_conds ] ) , must be _ different _ from @xmath96 of the medium : @xmath97 as @xmath98 , we see immediately that @xmath99 from ( [ relaxation_facts ] ) , we observe @xmath100 during relaxation in glasses .",
    "thus , we are forced to conclude that @xmath101 the equality occurring only when equilibrium has been achieved .",
    "the instantaneous temperature can be measured by using a small `` thermometer '' so as not to disturb the internal equilibrium of the glass .",

    "using @xmath103 for an isobaric process , which is the normal situation in most experiments , we see that the last term in ( [ first_law_enthalpy ] ) vanishes .",
    "hence , @xmath104 is valid in all isobaric processes , from which ( [ entropy_variation1 ] ) follows immediately .",
    "the relaxation that occurs in the glass originates from its tendency to come to thermal equilibrium during which its temperature @xmath50 varies with time ; recall that we are considering a cooling experiment .",
    "the relaxation process results in the lowering of the corresponding gibbs free energy , as is seen from ( [ gibbs_free_energy_variation ] ) , which is a consequence of the second law in ( [ second_law ] ) .",
    "accordingly , there are changes in its enthalpy and entropy , which are in the same direction ; see ( [ entropy_variation1 ] ) .",
    "the lowering of @xmath42 with time results in not only lowering the enthalpy in a cooling experiment , as observed experimentally , but also the entropy @xmath31 during relaxation:@xmath105 as shown in fig .",

    "we now need to turn our attention to the distinction between the fast and slow degrees of freedom ( dof ) , a characteristic of any glass .",
    "situation similar to this also occurs in the attainment of thermal equilibrium between the nuclear spins and their environment during nuclear relaxation @xcite , where the spin - lattice relaxation is extremely slow .",
    "the explanation of this kind of behavior ( slow and fast dof ) in a wide class of substances lies in internal molecular motions other than simple vibrations .",

    "we will denote those dof that have equilibrated with the medium at time @xmath24 by a subscript `` e '' , and the remaining that are not equilibrated by `` n.

    "the fast dof equilibrate within the observation time @xmath115  with the slow dof remaining out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "eventually , all dof come to equilibrium with the medium .",

    "the weak coupling allows us to treat them as almost uncorrelated and _ quasi - independent _ , which then immediately leads to the following partition of the entropy , the energy and the volume into two contributions , one from each kind because of their quasi - independence mentioned above :    [ partitions]@xmath120 where the notation is self - evident . it should be noted that  @xmath121  and @xmath122  stand for @xmath123 and @xmath124 the corrections to each of the partition due to the very weak coupling is small enough to be neglected .",
    "one should not confuse dof@xmath125 with only fast dof . to see this",

    "the e - component is in equilibrium ( with the medium ) , but the n - component is only in internal equilibrium . while the significance of the former as a scl `` component '' at @xmath77 ( dof=@xmath154 ) is obvious , the significance of the latter requires clarification . at @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath143 represents the temperature @xmath3 of the equilibrated scl ( dof=@xmath116 ) from which the current glass is obtained by cooling . at this time , the entropy @xmath155  of initial state of the glass at @xmath4 is equal to the entropy @xmath156  of the equilibrated scl ( dof=@xmath116 ) at the previous temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the latter has the energy and volume @xmath157 and volume @xmath158 at any later time @xmath159 , @xmath143 represents the temperature associated with the energy @xmath160 and volume @xmath134 of the non - equilibrated `` component '' of the glass and has a weight @xmath152 .",
    "this `` component , '' being in internal equilibrium , can be identified as a _ fictive _ scl [ dof=@xmath118 ]  at temperature @xmath162 of energy @xmath163 and volume @xmath164 in other words , the relaxing glass at any time @xmath24 can be considered as consisting of two scl `` components , '' one at temperature @xmath4 [ dof=@xmath117 ] and the other one [ dof=@xmath118 ] at temperature @xmath143 .",
    "the temperature @xmath166 _ uniquely _ determines the energy @xmath167 and volume @xmath168 of the corresponding _ fictive _ scl [ dof=@xmath118 ] .",
    "as the fictive liquid at @xmath166 contains only ( or mostly ) the slow dof , it does not yet really represent a scl associated with the system at @xmath166 , as the former lacks dof@xmath125 , while the latter contains all dof .",
    "this does not pose any problem as the missing dof@xmath125 at @xmath166 are in equilibrium not only with the dof@xmath128 at @xmath166 , the fictive scl mentioned above , but also with the medium at @xmath166 .",
    "thus , one can consider `` adding '' these missing dof@xmath125 ( dof=@xmath154 ) to the fictive liquid , which now represents the equilibrated scl ( dof=@xmath116 ) at @xmath166 .",
    "this scl is not the same as the glass with its fictive @xmath143 , as the latter has its dof@xmath125 at @xmath4 while the scl has all of its dof at @xmath143 . however",
    ", all of their thermodynamic properties associated with dof@xmath128 must be the same , as their entropy function is the same for both liquids .",
    "similarly , the scl `` component '' at @xmath77 ( dof=@xmath154 ) should also be `` supplemented '' by the missing dof@xmath128 to give rise to the equilibrated scl at @xmath77 ( dof=@xmath116 ) .",
    "we are now in a position to decide which of the temperatures @xmath50 and @xmath143 qualifies as the _ fictive temperature_. this temperature is supposed to characterize the non - equilibrium aspect of the system . as @xmath50 contains information about both kinds of dof , it is not the appropriate temperature to be identified as the fictive temperature , even though it depends on @xmath24 .",
    "the temperature @xmath143 , on the other hand , depends only on non - equilibrated dof@xmath128 ,  and should be identified as the fictive temperature of the relaxing glass at time @xmath24 .",
    "this temperature is not the internal temperature of the glass at this time , but represents the equilibrium temperature of the corresponding scl at @xmath169 as noted above .",
    "as first pointed out by littleton @xcite and lillie @xcite , and discussed by several authors , see for example @xcite , the viscosity keeps changing with time during relaxation .",
    "thus , if one uses an arrhenius form for the viscosity , it must depend not on @xmath4 , but on @xmath50 ; it is the instantaneous temperature that characterizes the instantaneous state of the glass .",
    "thus , the arrhenius form for the viscosity , which is usually taken to be proportional to the relaxation time , must be expressed as @xmath170   = \\eta_{0}\\exp\\left [ b\\left (   \\frac{x(t)}{t_{0}}+\\frac{1-x(t)}{t_{\\text{n}}(t)}\\right )   \\right ] , \\label{narayanaswamy_relaxation}\\ ] ] the form conventionally identified as the phenomenological tool - narayanaswamy form . here ,",
    "@xmath171 and @xmath172 are some parameters of the system and may depend on @xmath77 and also weakly on time @xmath24 .",
    "our derivation above justifies this form on a solid theoretical ground",
    ".    one can carry out a similar analysis with decomposing the volume ; see ( [ partitions_v ] ) .",
    "however , we do not obtain any new result as @xmath173 to see this , we proceed exactly as above but use the volumes instead of the energies . introducing the parameter @xmath174 defined by @xmath175 at fixed @xmath176 , which may be different from @xmath177 and using @xmath178 at fixed @xmath176  and @xmath160 , respectively , along with @xmath179  see ( [ eq_conds ] ) and ( [ isobaric_cond ] ) , we find the following decomposition of the inverse instantaneous temperature @xmath180 now , the new fictive temperature @xmath181 represents the temperature @xmath182 @xmath181 of corresponding fictive scl [ dof=@xmath118 ] with energy and volume @xmath183 and volume @xmath184 this fictive liquid is the same as noted above as far as the energy and volume are concerned .",
    "however , as scl is an equilibrated state , the specification of energy and volume _ uniquely _ determines the temperature , which from the earlier analysis was seen to be exactly @xmath153 thus , we conclude @xmath185 in order for the above decomposition to be consistent with ( [ narayanaswamy_decomposition ] ) at all times , we must ensure that@xmath186 in other words , our definition of the fictive temperature gives the same value whether we consider the energy relaxation or the volume relaxation .",
    "it is highly likely that the slow relaxation consists of many different relaxation modes , which we index by @xmath187 however , there does not seem to be any strong argument to suggest that all these different relaxation modes are almost decoupled as was the case for the fast and slow relaxations @xcite studied above .",
    "in that case , it is not possible to partition the thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy , etc . associated with dof@xmath128 as a sum over these different modes . despite this , let us follow the consequences of such an assumption .",
    "we express @xmath188 as a sum over @xmath189@xmath190 where the notation is quite transparent .",
    "we similarly express all of the n - quantities in ( [ partitions ] ) as a sum over @xmath189 .",
    "we can similarly express@xmath191 where @xmath192 we can now introduce a fictive temperature for each @xmath189-th n - dof@xmath193 such that @xmath194 a decomposition also described by narayanaswamy @xcite .",
    "however , because of the above equality , the presence of more than one kind of relaxation modes does not change the earlier decomposition ( [ narayanaswamy_decomposition ] ) .",
    "in other words , no new insight is gained by such an assumption .",
    "one can introduce an equilibrated fictive scl at each of the fictive temperatures as above .",
    "we will not stop here to do so as it is straightforward .",
    "we have developed a non - equilibrium thermodynamics to study systems away from equilibrium .",
    "the approach is quite general and is not limited to systems close to equilibrium . assuming internal equilibrium , a common practice in the field , we find the correction to the differential free energies that are consistent with de donder - prigogine approach to non - equilibrium thermodynamics ; see for example ( [ de_donder_thermodynamics ] ) . even though , we have mainly discussed supercooled liquids , the approach does not require the presence of a melting transition and an equilibrium crystal for its application .",
    "thus , it should also be applicable to other glassy systems such as spin glasses , where there is no equilibrium crystal as the true equilibrium state .",
    "the only requirement is that enough time has passed after the system has been disturbed so that the instantaneous temperature , pressure , etc",
    ". can be defined via ( [ eq_conds ] ) for the system even if they are changing with time . in other words , there is partial equilibrium in the isolated system .",
    "we then apply this thermodynamics to study glasses and clarify the concept of the fictive temperature @xmath143 widely used in the study of glasses by identifying it as a thermodynamic quantity ; see ( [ fictive_temp ] ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the fictive temperature has the same value even if we change the relaxing quantity .",
    "this temperature is not identical to but is related to the instantaneous temperature @xmath50 in a glass ; see ( [ narayanaswamy_decomposition ] ) .",
    "we use this relationship to establish the tool - narayanaswamy equation ( [ narayanaswamy_relaxation ] ) for the relaxation time on a solid theoretical ground .",
    "this form does not change even if we have more than one kind of slow relaxation ; the latter results in many different fictive temperatures , one for each kind of slow relaxation .",
    "we should finally contrast our approach with other approaches available in the literature .",
    "we can use ( [ partitions_s ] ) to express @xmath195 however , each term is still multiplied by @xmath196 implying that @xmath197 or @xmath198 are not multiplied by their respective temperatures @xmath199 or @xmath143 .",
    "thus , one can not consider @xmath121 and @xmath122 as separate in the first law ( [ first_law ] ) or in ( [ first_law0 ] ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with the approach developed in @xcite , where the entropy is divided into fast and slow dof ; see also @xcite .",
    "more recently , mller et al @xcite have used the approach of de donder to study glasses by considering a single structural order parameter ; however , the concept of the fictive temperature was not analyzed .",
    "a recent approach by wolynes ( * ? ? ? * ( b ) ) provides a local description of the relaxation in an inhomogeneous mosaic form , but the interest is in the dynamics , whereas our focus is not on any particular dynamics ."
