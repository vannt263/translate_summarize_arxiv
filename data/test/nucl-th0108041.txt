    "in low energy nuclear systems such as finite nuclei and nuclear matter , one can base complicated many - body calculations on a simple picture of point - like nucleons interacting by means of a two - body potential and three - body forces when needed . unlike for electronic systems where the low energy coulomb force is unambiguously determined from quantum electrodynamics",
    ", there is much ambiguity in nuclear physics owing to the non - perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energy scales .",
    "consequently , there are a number of high precision , phenomenological meson exchange models of the two - nucleon force @xmath2 , such as the paris  @xcite , bonn  @xcite , nijmegen  @xcite , argonne  @xcite and cd bonn  @xcite potentials , as well as model - independent but less accurate treatments based on chiral effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite , for a review see  @xcite",
    ". we also study the idaho potential  @xcite , which is based on the eft framework , but some model dependence is introduced in order to achieve similarly high precision as compared to the other interaction models .",
    "these nuclear force models incorporate the same one - pion exchange interaction ( ope ) at long distance , but differ in their treatment of the intermediate and short - range parts ( e.g. , parameterization of the repulsive core compared to @xmath3 exchange , different form factors , dispersive or field theoretical treatment of the @xmath4 exchange ) .",
    "the fact that the different short distance constructions reproduce the same phase shifts and deuteron properties indicates that low energy observables are insensitive to the details of the short distance dynamics .",
    "the eft approach exploits this insensitivity by explicitly keeping only the pion and nucleon degrees of freedom ( in accordance with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the qcd vacuum ) and encoding the effects of the integrated heavy degrees of freedom in the form of couplings which multiply model - independent delta functions and their derivatives , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the eft thus provides a model - independent description of the two - nucleon system .",
    "however , the high precision , i.e. , @xmath5 , description of the nucleon - nucleon scattering data provided by conventional models is at present not achieved by the rigorous eft potentials .    in fig .",
    "[ barediag ] , we observe that the realistic models of @xmath2 have quite different momentum - space matrix elements despite their common ope parts and reproduction of the same low energy data .",
    "it demonstrates that the low energy phase shifts and deuteron properties can not distinguish between the models used for the short distance parts .",
    "however , in many - body calculations the assumed short - distance structure of a particular @xmath2 enters by means of virtual nucleon states extending to high momentum , which will lead to model - dependent results , e.g. , in brueckner hartree - fock calculations of the binding energy of nuclear matter .",
    "it is clearly of great interest to remove such model dependence from microscopic nuclear many - body calculations .    motivated by these observations",
    ", we perform a renormalization group ( rg ) decimation and integrate out the ambiguous high momentum components of the realistic interactions . due to the separation of scales in the nuclear problem ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the model dependence of the input potentials will be largely removed as the high momentum components are excluded from the hilbert space . starting from any of the @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ barediag ] , we integrate out the momenta above a cutoff @xmath6 to obtain an effective low momentum potential , called @xmath0 .",
    "the physical condition is that the effective theory reproduces the deuteron pole and the half - on - shell ( hos ) @xmath7 matrices of the input @xmath2 model ( i.e. , the observable scattering phase shifts and the low momentum components of the two - body wave functions , which probe the ope part of the interaction ) , but with all loop momenta cut off at @xmath6 .",
    "we will find the striking result of fig .",
    "[ vlowk ] that the @xmath0 becomes independent of the particular input model for @xmath8 , which corresponds to laboratory energies @xmath9 .",
    "the latter is the energy scale over which the high precision potentials are constrained by experimental data .",
    "our strategy thus is a compromise between conventional models and eft treatments .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 reproduces the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts with similar accuracy as the high precision potentials , but without making further assumptions on the detailed high momentum structure , which can not be resolved by fitting to the low energy data only .",
    "the first step in the rg decimation is to define an energy - dependent effective potential ( called the @xmath10 box or the bloch - horowitz potential in effective interaction theory ) , which is irreducible with respect to cutting intermediate low momentum propagators .",
    "the @xmath10 box resums the effects of the high momentum modes , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denote the relative momentum of the outgoing , incoming , and intermediate nucleons .",
    "the principal value hos @xmath7 matrix for a given partial wave is obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath15 in terms of the effective cutoff - dependent @xmath10 potential , the scattering equation can be expressed as @xmath16 the low momentum effective theory defined by eq .",
    "( [ qbox ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ tqeq ] ) preserves the low energy scattering amplitudes and bound states independently of the chosen model space , i.e. , the value of the cutoff @xmath6 .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the effective @xmath10 potential is inconvenient for practical calculations . in order to eliminate the energy dependence",
    ", we introduce the so - called kuo - lee - ratcliff folded diagrams , which provide a way of reorganizing the lippmann - schwinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ tqeq ] ) , such that the energy dependence of the @xmath17 box is converted to a purely momentum dependent interaction , @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the folded diagrams are correction terms one must add to eq .",
    "( [ tqeq ] ) , if one were to set all @xmath10 box energies right side on - shell .",
    "this explicitly leads to ( for details see  @xcite ) @xmath19 the folded diagram resummation indicated in eq .",
    "( [ vfromq ] ) can be carried out to all orders using the similarity transformation method of lee and suzuki  @xcite . by construction ,",
    "the resulting energy - independent @xmath0 preserves the low momentum hos @xmath7 matrix of the input @xmath2 model  @xcite , @xmath20 where all momenta are constrained to lie below the cutoff @xmath6 .",
    "as our rg decimation preserves the half - on - shell @xmath7 matrix , we have @xmath21 , which implies a rg equation for @xmath0  @xcite @xmath22 similarly , a scaling equation is obtained for the @xmath10 box by integrating out an infinitesimal momentum shell , and one finds @xmath23 this equation was obtained previously by birse _",
    "et al . _ by requiring the invariance of the full - off - shell @xmath7 matrix , @xmath24  @xcite .    the rg equation , eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) , lies at the heart of the approach presented here : given a microscopic input model with a large cutoff , one can use the rg equation to evolve the bare interaction to a physically equivalent , but simpler effective theory valid for energies below the cutoff .",
    "the rg evolution separates the details of the assumed short distance dynamics , while incorporating their detail - independent effects on low energy phenomena through the running of the effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "the principal difference between the presented rg approach and the standard eft one is that we do not expand the interaction in powers of local operators .",
    "this implies that , first , one does not make assumptions on locality , and that second , we do not truncate after a certain power included in the low momentum interaction . in the eft approach , power - counting",
    "is used to calculate observables to a given order with controllable errors .",
    "in contrast , we start from a hamiltonian in a large space , which reproduces the low - energy observables with high accuracy and then decimate to a smaller , low momentum space so that the observables are reproduced . since the exact rg equation is solved without truncation , the invariance of the @xmath7 matrices is guaranteed .",
    "nevertheless , there are close similarities between the presented rg approach and the standard eft one .",
    "for example , at cutoffs above the pion mass , @xmath0 keeps the pion exchange explicit , while the unresolved short distance physics could be encoded in a series of contact terms .",
    "moreover , we find below that @xmath0 seems only to depend on the fact that all potential models have the same pion tail , and fit the same phase shifts .",
    "this is similar to eft treatments , where the interaction is constrained by pion exchange , phase shifts and the choice of regulator .",
    "referring to fig .",
    "[ vlowk ] , we find the central result of this letter .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath0 obtained from the different @xmath2 of fig .  [ barediag ] collapse onto the same curve for @xmath25 .",
    "similar results are found in all partial waves and will be reported elsewhere in detail  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath0 reproduces the experimental phase shift data and the deuteron pole with similar accuracy as compared with the high precision potential models , as we show in fig .",
    "[ phaseshifts ] .",
    "the reproduction of the phase shifts with the renormalized @xmath0 does however not require ambiguous high momentum components , which are not constrained by the low energy scattering data .",
    "we note that the change in sign of the @xmath26s@xmath27 and the @xmath28p@xmath27 phase shifts indicates that the effects of the repulsive core are properly encoded in @xmath0 .",
    "intriguingly , the @xmath0 mainly differs from the bare potential by a constant shift .",
    "this was previously observed by epelbaum _",
    "_ for a toy two - yukawa bare potential  @xcite .",
    "the constant shift in momentum space corresponds to a smeared delta function in coordinate space and accounts for the renormalization of the repulsive core from the bare interactions , see also  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ vlowk ] , we find a similar behaviour for the off - diagonal matrix elements , although the @xmath0 derived from the idaho potential begins to differ from the others at approximately @xmath29 .",
    "this discrepancy in the off - diagonal matrix elements arises from the fact that the idaho potential used here treats the 2@xmath30 exchange differently than the meson models do .",
    "we can integrate out further and lower the cutoff to @xmath31 , then the off - diagonal elements collapse as well .",
    "these results can be understood from @xmath7 matrix preservation .",
    "the hos @xmath7 matrix determines the phase shifts as well as the low momentum components of the low energy scattering and bound state wave functions . using the spectral representation of the @xmath7 matrix",
    ", @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath32 the @xmath2 models give the same on - shell @xmath7 matrices over the phase shift equivalent kinematic range of @xmath33 , but their off - shell behavior is a priori unconstrained . in practice , however , one observes that the realistic potential models result in similar hos @xmath7 matrices at low energies and momenta .",
    "this is understood from the fact that these models share the same long - range ope interaction and differ most noticeably on short - distance scales set by the repulsive core , @xmath34 and smaller .",
    "consequently , one expects that the off - shell differences are suppressed at energies and momenta below a corresponding scale of @xmath35 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ vfromt ] ) that the approximate hos @xmath7 matrix equivalence is a sufficient condition for the @xmath0 to be independent of the various potential models .",
    "moreover , the spectral representation clarifies that the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath0 are more sensitive to a particular off - shell behavior as observed in fig .",
    "[ vlowk ] , and thus deviate at a lower cutoff than the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "the collapse of the diagonal momentum - space matrix elements at the scale set by the constraining scattering data , @xmath36 , is nicely illustrated in fig .  [ 3s1collaps ] , which shows the rg evolution as the cutoff is successively lowered in the @xmath28s@xmath37 partial wave .",
    "next , we analyze the scaling properties of @xmath0 . for this purpose , we show the matrix element @xmath38 versus cutoff in fig .",
    "[ swavelambda ] for the @xmath26s@xmath27 and @xmath28s@xmath37 partial waves .",
    "the main results are the following .",
    "@xmath7 matrix preservation guarantees that @xmath38 flows toward the scattering length as the cutoff is taken to zero , these are @xmath39 and @xmath40 and are well reproduced with @xmath0 .    for cutoffs",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath0 is nearly independent of the cutoff in the @xmath26s@xmath27 channel and weakly linearly dependent in the @xmath28s@xmath37 channel .",
    "according to eft principles , the couplings are nearly independent of the cutoff as long as @xmath6 is large enough to explicitly include the relevant degrees of freedom needed to describe the scale one is probing .",
    "thus , the running of @xmath0 initiated at @xmath42 is a result of integrating out the pion .",
    "the rapid changes at very small @xmath6 are the result of the large scattering length .",
    "to illustrate the effects of the large scattering length , we solve the rg equation for @xmath38 for small cutoffs , with the @xmath26s@xmath27 scattering length as the @xmath43 boundary condition .",
    "one finds @xmath44 which is shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ swavelambda ] .",
    "clearly , the agreement for small @xmath45 is convincing .",
    "( [ smalllambda ] ) is identical to the kaplan - savage - wise solution for the renormalization of the momentum - independent contact term in the pionless eft , upon identifying @xmath6 with the regulator mass @xmath46 used in dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "the weak dependence on the cutoff in the @xmath28s@xmath37 partial wave results from the dominantly second order tensor contributions , which are peaked at relative momenta @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath0 preserves all scattering and bound states with energy @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the jump in the @xmath28s@xmath37 channel is the bound state contribution to the @xmath7 matrix and occurs at @xmath49 . from effective range theory and the low equation  @xcite",
    ", we have for the bound state contribution and thus the discontinuity @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the effective range in @xmath28s@xmath37 .",
    "this is in very good agreement with our results .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the separation of scales in the nuclear force can be successfully applied to derive a model - independent low momentum nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "@xmath0 is obtained by integrating out the high momentum components of various potential models , leading to a physically equivalent effective theory in the low momentum hilbert space .",
    "the decimation filters the details of the assumed short - distance dynamics of the bare interactions , provided one requires that the low energy observables are preserved under the rg .",
    "we have argued and provided numerical evidence that the model - independence of @xmath0 is a consequence of the common long - range ope interaction and the reproduction of the same elastic scattering phase shifts .",
    "the momentum scale @xmath52 , corresponding to laboratory energies @xmath53 , is precisely the scale at which the low momentum interaction becomes independent of the input models .",
    "our work demonstrates that the differences in the high momentum components of the nucleon force are not constrained by fits to the low energy phase shifts and the deuteron properties .",
    "@xmath0 does not have high momentum modes , which are related to the strong , short range - repulsion in conventional models .",
    "therefore , the low momentum interaction is considerably softer than the bare interactions ( both in a plane - wave and an oscillator basis ) and does not have a repulsive core . as a consequence ,",
    "when @xmath0 is used as the microscopic input in the many - body problem , the high momentum effects in the particle - particle channel do not have to be addressed by performing a brueckner ladder resummation or short - range correlation methods .",
    "in fact , with a cutoff on relative momenta , the phase space in the particle - particle channel is comparable to the particle - hole channels , and it would seem strange to resum the particle - particle channel , while the particle - hole channels are treated perturbatively in a hole - line expansion .",
    "the use of @xmath0 in microscopic nuclear many - body calculations leads to model - independent results .",
    "@xmath0 has been successfully used as shell model effective interaction in model space calculations for two valence particle nuclei such as @xmath54o and @xmath55te  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of these calculations has traditionally been the brueckner @xmath1 matrix , which depends on the bare @xmath2 used as well as the particular nuclei via the pauli blocking operator . by means of @xmath0",
    ", the same low momentum interaction is used in different mass regions . @xmath0",
    "has further been incorporated into fermi liquid theory .",
    "this connects the low momentum interaction in free space and the quasiparticle interaction in normal fermi systems .",
    "two constraints have been derived which relate the fermi liquid parameters of nuclear matter to the s - wave low momentum interaction at zero relative momentum  @xcite .",
    "finally , adopting the rg approach to fermi systems proposed by shankar , @xmath0 is taken as the input to microscopic calculations of the quasiparticle interactions and the pairing gaps in neutron matter  @xcite . from the success of these applications",
    ", we believe that the model - independent @xmath0 is a very promising starting point for microscopic nuclear many - body calculations .",
    "few - body calculations with @xmath0 are in progress .",
    "preliminary results for the ground state energies of triton and @xmath28he show that the three - body force for @xmath0 is weaker than e.g. , the conventional three - body force constructed for the argonne potential .",
    "we thank gerry brown for his encouragement and many stimulating discussions .",
