    ", the simplest qdm is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath2 where the sum runs over all plaquettes ( rhombi ) including the three possible orientations .",
    "the kinetic term , controlled by @xmath3 , flips the two dimers on every flippable plaquette , i.e. , on every plaquette with two parallel dimers , while the potential term controlled by the interaction @xmath4 describes a repulsion ( @xmath5 ) or an attraction ( @xmath6 ) between nearest - neighbor dimers .",
    "the rvb phase is now relatively well understood .",
    "the first result goes back to rokhsar and kivelson@xcite who showed that , for @xmath7 ( the rokhsar - kivelson or rk point ) , the ground state is the sum of all configurations with equal amplitudes : @xmath8 since then , dimer - dimer correlations have been shown to be short - ranged in a range of parameters below @xmath7 , @xcite and the excitation spectrum to be gapped.@xcite besides , it has topologically degenerate ground states on non - simply connected clusters.@xcite this degeneracy is not related to a standard symmetry breaking . indeed , there is no local order parameter,@xcite but only @xmath0 topological order.@xcite    in qdm , the nature of the phase transition from a liquid to a solid is a long standing problem .",

    ", we follow two strategies .",
    "first of all , we look at the problem in the context of a @xmath0 gauge theory on the triangular lattice . as usual",
    ", this theory can be mapped onto a dual ising model.@xcite the duality transforms the nonlocal excitations of the gauge theory into local excitations , which we study using a semiclassical approach .",
    "this simple @xmath11 expansion already captures most aspects of the confinement - deconfinement transition ( soft mode and condensation ) of the @xmath0 gauge theory . secondly ,",
    "building on the explicit form of the excitations of the @xmath0 gauge theory , we construct single vison wave functions for the qdm and study the properties of the system at the rk point in the variational hilbert space spanned by these states .",
    "these `` variational visons ''  living on the triangular _ plaquettes _ and experiencing a flux @xmath12 emanating from each _ site _ of the lattice  turn out to be linearly independent .",
    "the associated dispersion is in good qualitative agreement with that obtained in monte carlo simulations and the value of the gap at the rk point ( @xmath13 ) , obtained with a single variational parameter , has the correct order of magnitude ( monte carlo simulations@xcite give 0.089 ) .",
    "improving quantitatively further these variational results would require more adjustable parameters to account in more details for the local ( dimer - dimer , etc ) correlations in the vicinity of the core of the vortex , a task which has not been carried out here .",
    "the connection between qdms and @xmath0 gauge theories has already been discussed from different perspectives ( see in particular refs .  ) , and is rooted in the existence , in both families of models , of ising - like degrees of freedom subjected to local constraints ( hard - core constraints for the dimers , gauss law for the gauge theory ) .    in this section ,",
    "we review two known mappings : i ) from a @xmath0 lattice gauge theory on the hexagonal lattice to the triangular lattice qdm ( valid in a particular limit , sec .",

    "[ sssec : cpd ] and [ sssec : sca ] .",

    "since each kinetic term of the qdm flips the dimers around a rhombus , it corresponds to a product of four @xmath22 around this rhombus .",
    "this would , however , not keep the structure of the simple @xmath0 gauge theories , in which the kinetic term acts on an elementary plaquette of the lattice , a crucial ingredient to get a simple ising model by duality.@xcite an alternative is to consider the more standard @xmath0 gauge theory which , in its hamiltonian formulation , is defined by : @xmath23 where @xmath14 runs over the sites of the dual honeycomb lattice , and @xmath24 are the three bonds forming the triangular plaquette around site @xmath14 ( see fig .

    "as we shall see below , the limit @xmath33 lies deep inside the confined phase of the gauge theory , and from previous work on the qdm , it is known that at @xmath34 , the model is in a valence bond crystal phase .",
    "it would , of course , be very interesting to connect the two models away from this limit , when the gauge theory is in its deconfined phase and the qdm is in the dimer liquid phase .",
    "an interesting step in this direction is provided by higher order perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , to fourth order in @xmath36 , a repulsion between dimers @xmath37 is generated .",

    "as usual , this @xmath0 gauge theory is best analyzed by mapping it onto a dual ising model in a transverse field .",

    "rvb ) phases might seem fortuitous .",
    "a somewhat deeper connection will be described in the next section .",
    "in the ising model , elementary excitations for large enough @xmath36 are spin flips , induced by @xmath47 , which delocalize and get dressed under the effect of @xmath109 . in the equivalent dual gauge theory ,",
    "this excitation is produced by the nonlocal string operator @xmath137 . by analogy , it is natural to define a `` point '' vison creation operator for the qdm by@xcite @xmath138 where the dimer operator @xmath139 is defined by @xmath140 if bond @xmath19 is occupied , and @xmath141 otherwise .",
    "again , we consider here a finite lattice with open boundary conditions .",
    "let us first see to which extent this operator is the analog of the vortex creation operator in ising gauge theories .",
    "in gauge theories , the wilson loop operator defined by @xmath142 plays a central role since it allows one to distinguish ( in the absence of matter field , as here ) the deconfined and confined phases depending on whether its ground state expectation value ( or flux ) tends to zero exponentially with the perimeter of the domain @xmath120 ( deconfined ) or with the area of the domain ( confined ) . for a @xmath0 gauge theory @xmath143 and the flux going through @xmath120 measured by @xmath144 can only take two values @xmath145 . in that respect ,",
    "an interesting property of the operator @xmath137 is that it changes the flux between -1 and + 1 if the site @xmath14 is inside the domain .",
    "then , @xmath146 commutes with the wilson loop and does not change the flux unless @xmath14 and @xmath49 sit on _ opposite sides _ of the boundary .",
    "since the deconfined phase can be accessed from the @xmath147 limit , the ground state can be thought of as an ising paramagnet ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 everywhere ) `` dressed '' perturbatively by successive applications of @xmath150 , where @xmath14 and @xmath49 are nearest neighbors . since @xmath150 only changes the flux for pairs @xmath151 _ across the boundary _ , the expectation value of the wilson loop operator behaves according to a _ perimeter",
    "a similar perturbative argument can be used to derive the area law in the confined phase .",
    "most of these standard @xmath0 gauge theory results apply to the qdm , with one difficulty however .",
    "the wilson loop operator can not be defined in the same way since flipping the dimer occupation along a loop will often lead to an unphysical state that violates the condition of having exactly one dimer emanating from each site .",
    "different ways to overcome this problem can be envisaged .",
    "one possibility is to accept that the wilson loop operator gives zero when applied to states that are non - flippable along the loop .",
    "the property @xmath143 is lost , but @xmath144 has eigenvalues @xmath141 , @xmath21 , or @xmath27 , and eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath21 or @xmath27 are still interchanged when a vison operator ( eq .  [ eq : bare_vison ] ) is applied inside the domain .",
    "so confinement or deconfinement of visons is still expected to lead to area or perimeter laws .    alternatively ,",
    "starting from the observation that , when it does not give zero , the wilson loop operator just shifts the dimers along the contour , one can try to define a ( complicated ) flux operator in the dimer space which shifts the dimer along a `` fattened '' contour which `` adapts '' locally to the dimer configuration it acts upon .",
    "although tricky to define in practice , this operator would have the advantage that its square is still equal to 1 , preserving the manifest @xmath0 structure of the theory .    another way to underline the deep connection between the two models",
    "is to consider the ising model as a `` soft - dimer '' model and introduce the projection operator onto the `` hard - core '' dimer hilbert space , defined by : @xmath152 where the operator @xmath153 counts the number of frustrated bonds ( dimers ) around the plaquette @xmath154 : @xmath155 by construction , @xmath156 on all the ising configurations which correspond to a valid  hard - core \" dimer covering ( of the triangular lattice ) and @xmath157 otherwise .",
    "now , @xmath158 commutes with @xmath159 since all terms in @xmath158 contain an even number of @xmath160 operators .",
    "this means that @xmath158 conserves the total flux , so that a spin state with -1 flux becomes a dimer wave function with an odd number of visons after projection .",
    "equation  [ eq : bare_vison ] defines the simplest operator which changes the flux , that is , which creates a vison .",
    "so we may consider @xmath161 as a first variational approximation to the true lowest eigenstate of @xmath162 in the @xmath27 flux sector ( @xmath163 is the total number of dimer coverings ) .",
    "the ground state @xmath164 is a zero - energy eigenstate of @xmath162 , implying that the expectation value @xmath165 of the kinetic energy term exactly compensates the expectation value @xmath166 of the potential energy term .",
    "indeed , @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the total number of rhombi ( @xmath169 the number of sites ) and @xmath170 the probability to have 2 parallel dimers on a given rhombus in the classical dimer problem ( with uniform measure over all dimer configurations ) . using the pfaffians method,@xcite one finds in the thermodynamic limit @xmath171    in @xmath172 the expectation value of the potential energy term is the same as in @xmath164 .",
    "in fact , all the observables which are diagonal in the dimer basis commute with @xmath160 and thus have the same expectation value in the ground state @xmath164 and in the trial wave function @xmath172 .",
    "the increase of the energy is only kinetic . because the kinetic terms corresponding to the three diamonds around @xmath14 anticommute with @xmath47 , their expectation values has changed sign .",
    "thus we find @xmath173      one can lower the energy by constructing plane waves . to compute the associated dispersion relation we have to evaluate the following matrix elements : @xmath174 we begin with the overlap matrix @xmath175 ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 are defined in eq .",
