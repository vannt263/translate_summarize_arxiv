    "cooperation among animals , either within or between species , is widespread throughout nature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this presents a puzzle for darwinists since , according to darwin s theory , the rule among animals should be competition , not cooperation .    attempting to understand the evolution of cooperation , maynard smith and price @xcite applied game theory to interactions between competing individuals of the same species that use different strategies for survival .",
    "they found that in situations like combat , in which each individual must decide whether or not to escalate the fight without knowing his opponent s decision , the interests of both combatants are best served if both decide not to escalate the fight .",
    "@xmath3 games ( 2 players making a choice between 2 alternatives ) , which showed their usefulness in economics and social sciences @xcite , constitute also a basic tool to model the conflict / cooperation situations in biology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the marriage of game theory and darwinian evolution gave rise to a new branch of game theory , namely _ evolutionary game theory _ @xcite .",
    "in particular one of such games is the _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( pd ) , now well established as a useful tool for studying cooperative interactions among self - interested agents .",
    "the pd game comes from an experimental setup designed by the researchers at the rand corporation m. dresher and m. flood .",
    "the game refers to an imaginary situation in which two suspects are arrested near the scene of a crime .",
    "the police do nt have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge .",
    "the two prisoners are held in separate cells and offered a deal : if one testifies implicating the other in the principal crime will go free , while the other , if remains silent , will receive 10 years in prison . if they both testify against each other , each will receive 5 years . finally ,",
    "if they both remain silent , they will both be convicted by a minor crime and serve one year .",
    "what s the rational choice for each prisoner ? to remain silent ( cooperate with your partner ) or to confess ( not to cooperate ) ?",
    "the `` dilemma '' faced by the prisoners is that , whatever the other does , each is better off confessing than remaining silent .",
    "but the outcome obtained when both confess is worse for each than the outcome they would have obtained if both had remained silent .",
    "this puzzle illustrates a conflict between individual and group rationality .",
    "a group whose members pursue rational self - interest may all end up worse off than a group whose members act contrary to rational self - interest . formulated in its general form",
    "the pd game involves two players each confronting two choices : cooperate ( c ) or defect ( d ) and each makes his choice without knowing what the other will do .",
    "the possible outcomes for the interaction of both agents are : 1 ) they can both cooperate : ( c , c ) and get the  reward `` for mutual cooperation @xmath4 , 2 ) they can both defect : ( d , d ) and get the  punishment '' for mutual defection or 3 ) one of them cooperates and the other defects : ( c , d ) ; in that case the one who played c gets the `` sucker s payoff '' @xmath5 while agent who played d gets the `` temptation to defect '' @xmath6 .",
    "the following _ payoff matrix _ summarizes the payoffs for _ row _ actions when confronting with _ column _ actions :    @xmath7    with the four payoffs obeying the inequalities :    @xmath8    clearly it pays more to defect : if your opponent defects , and you cooperate you will end up with the worst payoff . on the other hand , even if your opponent cooperates , you should defect because in that case your payoff is @xmath6 which is higher than @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , independently of what the other player does , defection d yields a higher payoff than cooperation and is the _ dominant strategy _ for rational agents . nevertheless , reasoning that way both agents get @xmath9 which is worst than @xmath4 .",
    "a possible way out for this dilemma is to play the game repeatedly . in this iterated prisoner s dilemma ( ipd ) , in which condition ( [ eq : ine1 ] ) is supplemented with the condition : @xmath10 there are several strategies that outperform the dominant one - shot always d strategy and lead to some non - null degree of cooperation .",
    "the tournaments organized by axelrod @xcite , @xcite in the 80 were very illuminating .",
    "he invited researchers from different fields to contribute a strategy , in the form of a computer program , to play the prisoner s dilemma against each other and themselves repeatedly .",
    "each strategy specified whether to cooperate or defect based on the previous moves of both the strategy and its opponent .",
    "the programs were then ranked according to the total payoff accumulated .",
    "the winning program , was also the simplest : tit for tat ( tft ) , which plays c on the first move , and on all subsequent moves copies the choice of its opponent on the previous move . in an ecological approach @xcite ,",
    "the scores from round two were used to calculate the relative frequencies of the strategies in a hypothetical population .",
    "the strategies were then submitted to each subsequent round in proportion to their cumulative payoff in the previous round . in the long run ,",
    "tft outcompeted its rivals and went to fixation .",
    "axelrod and hamilton @xcite used these ecological competition between strategies as a basis for their analysis of the evolution of reciprocal altruism .",
    "this model is applicable in two opposite situations : on the one hand , in the case of higher animals , which can distinguish between their various opponents in order to reciprocate @xcite , discouraging thus defection . on the other hand , in the case of very simple organisms who have only one opponent in its lifetime .    nowak and may @xcite found another way to escape from the dilemma : the incorporation of territoriality in evolutionary game theory favours cooperation .",
    "the authors proposed simple cellular automata ( ca ) for general ecological systems involving indiscriminating organisms who play against several opponents ( their neighbours ) .",
    "they neglected all strategical complexities or memories of past encounters considering _ unconditional _",
    "cellular automata _",
    "i.e. _ agents using unconditional strategies ( each cell is either in a c or d state ) , as opposed to the conditional ones like tft , the _ simpleton _ @xcite or pavlov @xcite `` win - stay , lose - shift '' , etc . cells simply play repeatedly with their neighbours and in the next round or generation adopt the state of the most successful cell of their neighbourhood ( the one that collected the highest score among the cell itself and its neighbours ) . coexistence of both states or behaviours were found for a simplified version of the pd in which the punishment @xmath9 is equal to the sucker s",
    "payoff @xmath5 , .",
    "] implying then a `` weak dilemma '' ( maximum punishment",
    "_ i.e. _ the minimum possible value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "taking @xmath11 and @xmath12 allows to parameterise the payoff matrix in terms of just the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "szab and tke @xcite slightly modified the nowak - may ( n - m ) model with the addition of randomness : players are chosen to update their states randomly by copying the state of one of its neighbours with a probability depending on the payoff difference .",
    "they measured the fraction of cooperators @xmath13 for different values of the temptation to defect @xmath6 and found a continuous transition from @xmath14 to @xmath15 as @xmath6 increases .",
    "a problem with these simple spatial games is that if @xmath9 is augmented until it becomes non negligible compared with the reward @xmath4 then cooperation disappears and all the individuals end playing d.    an alternative to go beyond weak dilemmas is to consider more sophisticated players , with @xmath16-steps memory and strategies involving conditional probabilities , as lindgren and nordahl @xcite did .",
    "they considered payoff matrices parameterised in terms of two parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , and found the evolution of cooperation for payoff matrices beyond `` weak '' dilemmas .",
    "however , pursuing as much generality as possible without sacrificing the simplicity , which is part of the n - m model beauty , in this paper we explore a different approach .",
    "our starting point is realising that , interesting as it is , the n - m model lacks a fundamental ingredient , namely that of the stress exerted by the environment on the individuals .",
    "this is a crucial factor in order to explain the emergence of cooperation between self - interested individuals even when they are very simple ( without requiring long term memory nor distinguishing `` tags '' nor access to sophisticated strategies and , of course , no rational behaviour ) .",
    "the basic idea is that individuals need to collect , when playing with their @xmath20 neighbours , a payoff above certain threshold @xmath0 in order to prosper . in an ecosystem @xmath0",
    "represents the minimal resources ( nutrients , energy , etc . )",
    "without which organisms die ; in economics it may correspond to some threshold below which the business is no longer profitable , etc .",
    "thus , although d players are the most successful for @xmath21 large enough , when @xmath22 they can not achieve the critical payoff if surrounded by an entire neighbourhood of d s and so some of them will be replaced by c players .",
    "we use a normalized payoff matrix with @xmath11 and @xmath19 .",
    "besides the 3 parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 we include a probability @xmath23 for players of adopting the behaviour that is the opposite of the one used by the most successful neighbour ( @xmath24 ) . in the simplest model version",
    "an individual has a probability of behaving different from the @xmath24 if the score of the @xmath24 is below @xmath0 .",
    "this simple recipe allows the evolution of cooperation even when the punishment @xmath9 is relatively soft i.e. when the sucker s payoff is much worse than the payoff for mutual defection ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "furthermore , it gives rise to states of universal cooperation .",
    "we also consider a more sophisticated hybrid model version in which the selective rule of copying the behaviour of the @xmath24 is supplemented with a `` win - stay , lose - shift '' criterion .",
    "that is , individuals also take into account if their own scores @xmath26 are below or above @xmath0 to update their behaviour .",
    "this version , although more complex , seems well - grounded since it is widely known that pavlovian strategies play a central role in animal behaviour @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , the remarkable experiments conducted by milinski and wedekind @xcite,@xcite revealed that , humans engaged in social dilemma games use by far strategies of the kind of  win - stay , lose - shift \" .    for the different model versions , we explore a subspace of the space of parameters @xmath27 measuring the fraction of cooperators and quantities characterizing the resulting cluster structure .",
    "the players , which can adopt only two _ unconditional strategies _ or behaviours when playing with their neighbours : cooperate ( c ) or defect ( d ) , are thus represented by binary state cells of a two dimensional automaton . in this work we restrict ourselves to square grids and two types of neighbourhood : a)_von neumann neighbourhood _ , consisting of the @xmath28 first neighbouring cells of a given cell , and b ) _ moore neighbourhood _ , formed by the @xmath29 cells surrounding a given cell .",
    "typical grid sizes range from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "the score @xmath26 of a given player is the sum of all the payoffs it collects against its neighbours .",
    "tables [ tab : z4 ] and [ tab : z8 ] summarize the different scores for a player depending on the number of c cells in its neighbourhood .",
    "the dynamic is synchronous : all the agents update their states simultaneously at the end of each lattice sweep .    .score",
    "@xmath26 for a player depending on its state c ( row 1 ) or d ( row 2 ) and the number of c and d agents in its neighbourhood for the @xmath28 case . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the stepladder structure for @xmath29 ( a similar analysis holds for @xmath28 ) can be easily explained considering the scores for d agents of table [ tab : z8 ] .",
    "as long as @xmath0 increases each d agent needs more c agents in its surroundings in order to achieve the threshold .",
    "so cooperation grows with @xmath0 by steps at the values mentioned before : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and so on , which correspond to straight lines with different slopes in the @xmath34 plane . finally , when @xmath35 the minimum required is above any agent s possible score , then the fraction of agents c one time step further will be given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the fraction of agents ( c and d ) whose most successful neighbour is a d - cell and @xmath38 is the fraction of agents ( c and d ) whose most successful neighbour is a c - cell .",
    "as none of the agents achieves the threshold , the state of all of them is updated with probability @xmath23 to a state opposite to the one of the @xmath24 . for small values of @xmath23 , @xmath39 (",
    "since a c agent needs to be surrounded by a minimum number of c agents to be the most successful ) , @xmath40 and finally @xmath41 . this explains why the height of the plateau coincides with the probability @xmath23 .",
    ", we checked this also for @xmath42 and @xmath43 + the landscape that emerges from the second model variant ( see fig . [",
    "fig : empty].a and fig .",
    "[ fig : empty].b ) is very similar to the one produced by the first variant",
    ". +    , ( a ) z=4 neighbours and ( b ) z=8 neighbours ; frequency is normalized by the total number of cells ( including empty ones),height=302 ]",
    "a relevant input for an agent to assess its performance in a game is the comparison of its own score @xmath26 with @xmath0 .",
    "if it is above @xmath0 then the agent s behaviour may be worth keeping even if it is not the most successful in the neighbourhood .",
    "the behaviour updating rule thus becomes more sophisticated and instead of the previous rule we have :    1 .",
    "if @xmath2 : the player adopts the opposite state of its @xmath24 but _ now _ with probability @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath45 : there are two alternatives depending on its score @xmath26 : * if @xmath46 , the player keeps its state with probability @xmath23 ( adopts the state of its @xmath24 with probability @xmath44 ) . * if @xmath47 the player keeps its state with probability @xmath44 ( adopts the state of its @xmath24 with probability @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore , this model interpolates between the ordinary evolutionary recipe of copying the most successful neighbour and the `` win - stay , lose - shift '' criterion of the game analysed in detail by herz @xcite .",
    "again , the system reaches a steady state with a definite value @xmath13 for the fraction of agents playing c after a transient .",
    "this hybrid model produces qualitatively similar results , but there are remarkable modifications in the landscape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybrid ] .",
    ", ( a ) z=4 neighbours and ( b ) z=8 neighbours.,height=302 ]    firstly , we observe a strong increase in @xmath13 for all the parameter space surrounding the peak zone . in particular , note the height of the plateau and the step formation .",
    "secondly , most part of the plateau is replaced by steeply `` cliffs '' .",
    "figure [ fig : cvsum ] shows the fraction of cooperators for @xmath48 , @xmath29 . between @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "the fraction @xmath13 increases almost monotonously with @xmath0 .",
    "however , once @xmath0=8 is reached , the fraction of cooperators falls down drastically .",
    "this is due to the fact that c agents surrounded entirely by c s can no longer survive and turn into d agents with probability @xmath51 . since some of the d agents still have a payoff above @xmath0 , they survive to the next round , so cooperation fraction should decrease . as long as @xmath0 increases , more c s are neccesary in the neighbourhood of a d for this agent to keep its strategy , so cooperation would increase again .",
    "when @xmath35 the equation ( [ eq : cfc1 ] ) is replaced by    @xmath52    hence , in the steady state ( @xmath53 ) we have the solution @xmath54 .     for @xmath6=1.6 , z=8.,height=226 ]      an additional novelty of this model , connected with the greater richness in the @xmath13 landscape ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , is the cluster structure which exhibits power law scaling for a restricted region in the @xmath6-@xmath0 plane ( for the basic model no power - laws were found ) . in this subsection",
    "we analyse the cluster structure and spatial patterns in the three different regions of the plane @xmath55 identified in the previous subsection .",

    "the histogram [ fig : loglog].b shows that only exist ( giant ) clusters for a narrow interval of sizes .",

    "our findings might be connected with questions in evolutionary genetics like the effects of deleterious mutations on fitness .",
    "mutations , in spite of being the ultimate engine for evolution , in general have a negative effect on fitness .",
    "it has been widely accepted that these deleterious fitness effects are , on average , magnified in stressful environments .",
    "recent experimental measures of growth rates of e.coli mutants under a diverse set of environmental stresses suggest just the opposite : the effects of deleterious mutations can sometimes be ameliorated in stressful environments @xcite .",
    "a possibility is that c - inclined organisms may be regarded as deleterious mutants in the case of no stress which can take over the population under some ( appropriate ) degree of stress .",
    "it is worth remaking that the more sophisticated model , that results when supplementing the ordinary evolutionary recipe of copying the most successful neighbour with a pavlovian `` win - stay , lose - shift '' criterion , exhibits two relevant properties .",
    "the first is global optimisation _",
    "i.e. _ it enhances the cooperation level .",
    "the second is the emergence of power - law scaling in the size distribution for clusters of c - agents .",
    "power - laws were also found in a different study of cellular automata playing the pd game with pavlovian strategies @xcite .",
    "however , in that case , this scaling behaviour is much more robust than the one we found here which holds only for quite reduced region in the @xmath55 plane .",
    "the effect of requiring a threshold has been analysed in social sciences .",
    "for instance , in relation to reinforcement learning by borgers and sarin @xcite,@xcite , although treatment is quite different .",
    "indeed , this threshold represents an aspiration level and may improve the decision maker s long - run performance .",
    "to conclude , we envisage some future extensions of this ( these ) model ( models ) . for instance to explore the effect of heterogeneities , in the environment ( a landscape dependent @xmath0 function ) or in the agents ( different payoff matrices , different types of individuals , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , the spatial networks observed in nature are in general not uniform square lattices like the ones considered here .",
    "so another interesting direction that seems worth studying is to consider more realistic network topologies , for example scale free @xcite or small worlds networks @xcite .",
