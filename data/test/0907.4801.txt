    "in recent years , quarkonium hadroproduction has become the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "the main reason is that production and decays of heavy quarkonia have been an ideal laboratory to investigate quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "their large masses provide a hard scale which allows us to use perturbative qcd techniques .",
    "basically , there exist three distinct formalisms for quarkonium production .",
    "the simplest one is the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite , where the hadronization of the @xmath4 pairs into quarkonia is assumed to be dominated by long - distance fluctuations of gluon fields which motivates a statistical treatment of color . in the color - singlet model ( csm )",
    "@xcite , quarkonium is viewed as a non - relativistic color - singlet bound state of a @xmath4 pair with definite angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "production rates for a quarkonium state are computed by calculating the production of a heavy quark pair which is constrained to be in a color - singlet state and have the same angular momentum quantum numbers as the physical quarkonium . in the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )",
    "factorization formalism @xcite , non - perturbative aspects of quarkonium production are organized in an expansion in powers of @xmath5 , the relative velocity of the @xmath4 in quarkonia . for production of @xmath6-wave quarkonia , the results of the csm are recovered in the limit of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , in the nrqcd formalism new quarkonium production mechanisms are now possible since it is no longer required that the @xmath4 produced in the short - distance process have the same color and angular momentum quantum numbers as the quarkonium state .",
    "recently , several computations of the qcd corrections to the inclusive quarkonium hadroproduction processes have shed some light on the robustness and/or deficiencies of those models .",
    "comprehensive reviews of recent developments in the theory of quarkonium production can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    beside the studies of inclusive production",
    ", efforts are being made to obtain improved theoretical predictions for complementary observables to the inclusive yield , such the hadroproduction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in association with a photon . in the framework of csm ,",
    "the associated production of @xmath8 at a hadron collider was first proposed as a good channel to investigate the gluon distribution in the proton with a relatively clean signal @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a process at the tevatron energy has been considered in the csm at lo , and the results show that the contribution from the gluon fusion sub - process is dominant over that from the fragmentation process ( the same occurs at the lhc @xcite ) .",
    "the color - octet contributions were investigated in ref . @xcite and it was found they are dominant in the large @xmath9 region .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath10 hadroproduction at the lhc has been investigated . in ref .",
    "@xcite the real next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) order qcd contribution to hadroproduction of a @xmath11 via color singlet transitions for the inclusive case has been addressed . in this letter , we examine the production of associated @xmath8 and @xmath12 at large @xmath9 within the nrqcd approach in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "such processes are relatively clean because the produced large @xmath9 quarkonium is easy to detect through its leptonic decay modes and the quarkonium s large @xmath9 is balanced by the associated high energy photon . at the lhc energy ,",
    "the leading contributions are dominated by gluon induced hard processes and then the quarkonium production associated with a direct photon will be strongly dependent on the nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "our goal is to use the @xmath8 and @xmath12 processes as auxiliary observables to constrain the nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "this is motivated by similar investigations on inclusive heavy quark , quarkonium and prompt photon production in central proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions ( see e.g. refs .",
    "one of the nuclear effects which is expected to modify the behavior of gluon distribution is the nuclear shadowing .",
    "this effect has been observed in the nuclear structure functions by different experimental collaborations @xcite in the study of the deep inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) off nuclei .",
    "the modifications on @xmath13 depend on the parton momentum fraction @xmath14 .",
    "while for momentum fractions @xmath15 ( shadowing region ) and @xmath16 ( emc region ) , a depletion is observed in the nuclear structure functions , in the intermediate region ( @xmath17 ) it is verified an enhancement known as antishadowing .",
    "these experimental results strongly constrain the behavior of the nuclear quark distributions , whereas the the nuclear gluon distribution is still an open question due to the scarce experimental data in the small-@xmath14 region and/or for observables strongly dependent on the nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we summarize the main formulas concerning the process @xmath8 in the nrqcd formalism and define the nuclear modification factors for proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "in last section we present the numerical results considering the more recent nuclear parton parameterizations and estimating the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factors at the lhc energies .",
    "as long as @xmath8 is produced at small longitudinal momentum fraction , @xmath20 , the gluon fusion channel dominates over the @xmath21 annihilation process .",
    "therefore , at high energies and at leading order ( lo ) , the process @xmath22 contributes at the partonic level with six feynman diagrams , which is similar to that of @xmath23 in inclusive @xmath2 hadroproduction .",
    "the signal we focus on is the production of a @xmath2 and an isolated photon produced back - to - back , with their transverse momenta balanced .",
    "the lo cross section is obtained by convoluting the partonic cross section with the parton distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath24 , in the proton , where @xmath25 is the factorization scale . at nlo expansion on @xmath26 ,",
    "there are one virtual correction and three real corrections processes , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the nrqcd formalism ,",
    "the contributing subprocesses are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "the color - singlet @xmath33 state contributes at @xmath34 but the color - octet channels all contribute higher orders in @xmath5 ( the relative velocity between the heavy quarks ) .",
    "we are interested here in the quarkonium production in a nuclear medium . in order to get the @xmath8 yield in @xmath35 and @xmath36 collisions ,",
    "a shadowing - correction factor has to be applied to the @xmath2 yield obtained from the simple superposition of the equivalent number of @xmath37 collisions .",
    "this shadowing factor can be expressed in terms of the ratios @xmath38 of the nuclear parton distribution functions in a nucleon of a nucleus @xmath39 to the pdf in the free nucleon .",
    "most of shadowing models provide the nuclear ratios at a given value of @xmath40 and then evoluted through the dglap evolution equations @xcite to lo accuracy . only very recently",
    ", the nuclear pdfs have been available at nlo accuracy .",
    "therefore , in what follows we will consider a lo calculation for the nuclear modification factors in order to be consistent with the limitation of shadowing models . in this respect",
    "our analysis can not be considered as fully nlo and should be updated once the nlo calculation in nrqcd approach is available for the nucleon case . on the other hand",
    ", this is not an important limitation to our results as we will discuss later on .    in order to obtain the transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) distribution for the process",
    "@xmath22 , we express the differential cross section as @xmath41 where we have defined @xmath42 , with @xmath43 being the center of mass energy of the @xmath44 system and @xmath45 being the transverse mass of outgoing @xmath2 . the gluon distribution , @xmath46 , in the hadron a / b is evaluated at factorization scale @xmath25 .",

    "( [ diffcs ] ) , it implies that the differential cross section at small values of the @xmath2 transverse momentum in @xmath85 ( and @xmath86 ) collisions at the lhc is determined by the behavior of the nuclear gluon distribution at @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that smaller values of @xmath14 contribute at @xmath8 production in the forward rapidity region which can be measured , e.g. , with the cms and alice experiments at lhc .",
    "the main input in the calculations of @xmath8 cross sections is the nuclear parton distribution function ( npdf ) . over last years",
    "several groups has proposed parameterizations for the npdfs @xcite , which are based on different assumptions and techniques to perform a global fit of different sets of data using the dglap evolution equations .",
    "these parameterizations predict very distinct magnitudes for the nuclear effects . for larger values of @xmath14 , the eks and the eps npdfs show antishadowing , while this effect is absent for the hkn and ds parameterizations in the @xmath88 domain .",
    "while the nuclear shadowing is moderate for ds and hkn parameterizations and somewhat bigger for eks one , the eps prediction has a much stronger suppression compared with the other parameterizations . for smaller @xmath14 around @xmath89 ,",
    "while ds and hkn parameterizations have about @xmath90 suppression and eks one have about @xmath91 suppression , for the eps parameterization this effect goes to almost @xmath92 suppression in the nuclear gluon compared with the @xmath39 scaled gluon content in the proton .    in what follows",
    "we calculate the quarkonium production in association with a direct photon in @xmath35 and @xmath36 collisions , considering the nuclear parton distributions discussed above .",
    "we then estimate the nuclear modification factor for these predictions .",

    "in order of to be consistent , we consider only the lo version of the npdfs employed ( besides , the eks npdf is only evolved to leading order ) .",
    "as we are calculating ratios between cross sections , common uncertainties on the normalization of the @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 cross sections , e.g. due to higher order contributions , are expected to cancel out in the nuclear modification factors .    in fig .",

    "the results show distinct behaviors of @xmath18 for different npdf s .",
    "the difference between central and forward rapidities for @xmath18 comes from the kinematical @xmath50 range probed in the two cases .",
    "while for central rapidities the values of @xmath50 are ever larger than @xmath96 , in the forward case the minimum value could be @xmath97 , increasing with @xmath9 . consequently , the effects in the nuclear gluon distribution which contribute for the quarkonium production are different in the two rapidities . in the @xmath9 interval shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa ] , antishadowing effect is not observed as @xmath98 .",
    "we have that the nuclear factor is substantially suppressed in the eps ( eks ) case , going down an @xmath99 at @xmath100 gev , while in the ds ( hkn ) case it is almost flat and equal to 0.95 ( 0.85 ) in the full @xmath9 range .",
    "moreover , differently from the ds and hkn predictions , the eks and eps parameterizations lead to a strong transverse momentum dependence .",
    "consequently , the determination of the magnitude and @xmath9 dependence of the this nuclear modification factor at the lhc could be useful to determine the properties of the shadowing in the gluon distribution .",
    "the production of @xmath8 can also be studied in the collision of two heavy nuclei . in what follows",
    "we present our estimates for the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath19 for central and forward rapidities defined by @xmath101 in @xmath36 collisions at the lhc ( @xmath102 tev ) . in this case",

    "similarly to the @xmath35 case , we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] that the factor @xmath19 is strongly modified by the shadowing effects . for low @xmath9 the suppression is stronger than in the @xmath35 case .",

    "this effect could then be used to discriminate among the nuclear pdf s .",

    "[ fig : raa_upsi ] , where we present our results for the transverse momentum dependence of the ratio @xmath19 for central and forward rapidities at the lhc ( @xmath102 tev ) . here",
    "the nuclear effects are more pronounced than in the @xmath35 case .",
    "the eps parameterization shows the steepest behavior , presenting shadowing ( suppression ) for low @xmath9 and antishadowing ( enhancement ) for larger @xmath9 and central rapidities .",
    "the eks has a similar although less pronounced behavior , and the hkn , which presented an almost flat behavior in the @xmath2 case , it now grows steeper .",
    "thus , the hkn versus ds could be discriminated at low @xmath9 and central rapidities , and at high @xmath9 and forward rapidities . in the forward case , antishadowing behavior at high @xmath9",
    "tend to be less important for the eks and eps npdf s as @xmath9 grows .",
    "we conclude that shadowing and antishadowing effects could be tested in different @xmath9 and rapidity regions and therefore help in discriminating among the different nuclear pdf s .    finally , we discuss qualitatively the results and comment on the limitations of present calculations .",
    "let us first concentrate on the @xmath35 case where cold matter effects also play an essential role . at leading order ,",
    "the differential cross section is simply proportional to the product of gluon densities @xmath119 where @xmath120 are the projectile and target - parton momentum fractions . in this kinematics",
    ", the nuclear modification factor reduces to @xmath121 . in our analysis above we did not take into account the nuclear absorption . in the framework of the probabilistic glauber model , this effect refers to the probability for the pre - resonant @xmath4 pair to survive to the propagation through the nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 may be sensitive to inelastic rescattering processes in a large nuclei , which spoil the simple relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath122 . assuming the factorization between the quarkonium production process and the subsequent possible @xmath2 inelastic interaction with nuclear matter , we can write the production cross section as @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes the probability for no interaction , or survival probability , of the meson with the nucleus target . in a glauber model it depends on the @xmath125 inelastic cross section , @xmath126 , and reads as ( for large nucleus ) : @xmath127,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the thickness function @xmath128 .",
    "as @xmath126 is not well constrained from data , this is additional uncertainty entering on the nuclear modification factor . in a rough estimation",
    "we have @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath36 collision can be obtained using similar methods .",
    "we quote ref .",
    "@xcite as an example where the magnitude of these corrections has been studied for the @xmath2 production in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .    concerning nucleus - nucleus collisions , the situation is more complicated as final state effects can not be disregarded .",
    "for instance , the processes of dissociation and recombination of @xmath130 pairs in the dense medium can be computed through the co - movers interaction model @xcite , which also incorporates also the recombination mechanism @xcite .",
    "as mentioned for @xmath35 case , nuclear effects in nucleus - nucleus collisions are usually expressed through the so - called nuclear modification factor , @xmath131 , defined as the ratio of the @xmath2 yield in @xmath36 and _ pp _ scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath132 .",
    "a similar factor can be defined in our case of @xmath133 production , having in mind that the prompt photon is insensitive to nuclear matter effects .",

    "is difficult to single out the size of each contribution at the lhc for the @xmath158 . for such photon - associated high-@xmath9 quarkonium production ,",
    "the final production cross section is modified by nuclear absorption , or final - state interaction between the pre - resonance state and the nuclear medium as discussed above .",
    "notice that the glauber absorption model is only valid for total production cross section which is dominated by low-@xmath9 quarkonium production .",
    "here , we focus on the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor due to gluon shadowing and it is timely to discuss the @xmath9 dependence of the final - state interaction . to address this issue , we can do an educated guess by verifying what we learn from rhic .",
    "the modification factor @xmath159 has been determined as a function of @xmath9 in the central rapidity region , analyzed both by the phenix @xcite and star @xcite collaborations .",
    "the factor increases with @xmath9 and star data indicate a nuclear modification factor larger than one for @xmath160 gev @xcite . if this non - suppression of @xmath2 at large @xmath9 is confirmed it does not seem to behave as the other hadrons , which are significantly suppressed in central collisions and for increasing @xmath9 .",
    "this behavior is closer to the one observed in prompt photons production . in the case of quarkonium plus a prompt photon",
    ", we then would expect the same non - suppresion pattern , since the hard photon is not affected by nuclear matter effects .    as a final comment",
    ", we notice that the present calculation can be also extended for the rhic kinematic region , where the @xmath21 annihilation processes could also contribute .",
    "for instance , a study has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the inclusive @xmath2 production in @xmath37 collisions at rhic within the phenix detector acceptance range using the color singlet and the color octet mechanisms based on nrqcd formalism .",
    "the calculations reproduce the rhic data with respect to the @xmath9 distribution , the rapidity distribution and the total cross section at @xmath161 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have considered the csm approach ( taking into account the @xmath150-channel cut contributions @xcite ) and cold nuclear matter effects to compute the @xmath2 nuclear modification factor for @xmath162 and @xmath163 collisions at rhic energies .",
    "the data description is quite satisfactory .",
    "therefore , this indicates the robustness of the framework in describing the high energy data .",
    "of course , we are aware of the limitations of present calculation .",
    "the picture of a @xmath2 exactly recoiling back to back with the photon is simplified , since possible contributions of the color - octet channel would lead to a fragmentation of the gluon into the meson , which would not be exactly recoiling against the photon .",
    "the experimental detection could be an additional concern .",
    "for example , alice @xcite can tag the muons in the forward region , where however there is no photon reconstruction , while it can detect the photons in the central region , where however the muon detection is not as good .",
    "in the case of cms @xcite , the thresholds in @xmath9 both for muons and for the photon appear quite low to ensure an efficient triggering .    in summary , in this letter",
    "we have investigated the quarkonium production in association with a isolated photon in pa and aa collisions at the lhc , considering the nrqcd factorization formalism and some of the parameterizations for the nuclear parton distributions available in the literature .",
    "our results show that the nuclear modification factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are useful observables to discriminate among the different parton distributions in the nuclear medium .",
    "in particular , the predicted shadowing by the eps parameterization is considerably larger than in the previous nuclear pdf s .",
