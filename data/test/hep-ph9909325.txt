    "since the initial work of kobayashi and maskawa , the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions is known to be able to accommodate the experimentally observed cp ",
    "violation through a unique phase , @xmath1 , in the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa mixing matrix ( ckm ) . however , the available experimental information , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is not enough to establish this phase as the only source of cp  violation .",
    "most of the extensions of the sm include new observable phases that may significantly modify the pattern of cp violation .",
    "supersymmetry is , without a doubt , one of the most popular extensions of the sm .",
    "indeed , in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , there are additional phases which can cause deviations from the predictions of the sm .",
    "after all possible rephasings of the parameters and fields , there remain at least two new physical phases in the mssm lagrangian .",
    "these phases can be chosen to be the phases of the higgsino dirac mass parameter ( @xmath4 $ ] ) and the trilinear sfermion coupling to the higgs , ( @xmath5 $ ] ) @xcite . in fact , in the so  called constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , with strict universality at the grand unification scale , these are the only new phases present .    it was soon realized that for most of the cmssm parameter space , the experimental bounds on the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron constrained @xmath6 to be at most @xmath7 .",
    "consequently these new supersymmetric phases have been taken to vanish exactly in most studies of cmssm .",
    "however , in the last few years , the possibility of having non - zero susy phases has again attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "several new mechanisms have been proposed to suppress edms below the experimental bounds while allowing susy phases @xmath8 .",
    "methods of suppressing the edms consist of cancellation of various susy contributions among themselves @xcite , non - universality of the soft breaking parameters at the unification scale @xcite and approximately degenerate heavy sfermions for the first two generations @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we showed that , in a model with heavy sfermions of the first two generations and in the large @xmath9 regime , @xmath2 and @xmath10 could receive very sizeable contributions from these new susy phases .",
    "similar studies @xcite including a larger set of experimental constraints have reported the impossibility of such large supersymmetric contributions . and @xmath11 @xcite . ]    in this work , we are going to complete our previous analysis with the inclusion of all the relevant constraints in a cmssm scenario .",
    "in doing so we adopt a different perspective .",
    "we will assume from the very beginning that both supersymmetric phases are @xmath8 , ignoring for the moment edm bounds .",
    "in these conditions , and taking into account other cp  conserving constraints , we will analyze the effects on the low energy cp ",
    "violation observables , especially @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noticed that the model used in @xcite can be easily obtained as a limit of the cmssm by decoupling the first two generations of squarks and neglecting the intergeneration mixing in the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "hence , our results in the more general cmssm will include this model as a limiting case .",
    "in the next section we study the new sources of flavor mixing present at the electroweak scale in any supersymmetric model . in section 3",
    "we are going to analyze neutral meson mixing , i.e. @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath15 mixings , with large supersymmetric phases .",
    "section 4 will be devoted to the study of the branching ratio of the decay @xmath16 . in section 5",
    "we will show the impact of the measured @xmath16 branching ratio on the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "section 6 will present our conclusions and in appendices a and b we collect , respectively , the formulas for the integration of relevant rge s and the different loop functions appearing in the text .",
    "the issue of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions in the cmssm has been widely investigated in the literature . for the completeness of the discussion",
    ", we briefly recall those properties which will be relevant for our analysis .",
    "the cmssm is the simplest supersymmetric structure we can build from the sm particle content .",
    "this model is completely defined once we specify the soft - supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "these are taken to be strictly universal at some ultra - high energy scale , which we take to be the grand unification scale ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18    that is , there is a common mass for all the scalars , @xmath19 , a single gaugino mass , @xmath20 , and all the trilinear soft - breaking terms are directly proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings in the superpotential with a proportionality constant @xmath21 .",
    "now , with the use of the renormalization group equations ( rge ) of the mssm , as explained in appendix a , we can obtain the whole supersymmetric spectrum at the electroweak scale .",
    "all the supersymmetric masses and mixings are then a function of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath9 .",
    "we require radiative symmetry breaking to fix @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite with tree ",
    "level higgs potential . and",
    "@xmath27 are switched off .",
    "for this reason we prefer to give the relevant rge s with non  vanishing susy phases in appendix a. ]    it is important to notice that , even in a model with universal soft breaking terms at some high energy scale as the cmssm , some off  diagonality in the squark mass matrices appears at the electroweak scale . working on the basis where the squarks are rotated parallel to the quarks , the so  called super ckm basis ( sckm ) , the squark mass matrix is not flavor diagonal at @xmath28 .",
    "this is due to the fact that at @xmath17 there exist two non - trivial flavor structures , namely the two yukawa matrices for the up and down quarks , which are not simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "this implies that through rge evolution some flavor mixing leaks into the sfermion mass matrices . in a general supersymmetric model",
    ", the presence of new flavor structures in the soft breaking terms would generate large flavor mixing in the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "however , in the cmssm , the two yukawa matrices are the only source of flavor change . as always in the sckm basis ,",
    "any off - diagonal entry in the sfermion mass matrices at @xmath28 will be necessarily proportional to a product of yukawa couplings .",
    "the rge s for the soft breaking terms are sets of linear equations , and thus , to match the correct quirality of the coupling , yukawa couplings or tri - linear soft terms must enter the rge in pairs , as we can see in eqs .",
    "( a.1-a.3 ) in appendix a.    in fact , in the up ( down ) squark mass matrix the up ( down ) yukawas will also be diagonalized and so will mainly contribute to diagonal entries while off  diagonal entries will be due to the down ( up ) yukawa matrix .",
    "this means , for instance , that in this model the off - diagonality in the @xmath29 matrix will roughly be @xmath30 . with @xmath31 a proportionality factor that typically is , @xmath32 as expected from the loop factor and the running from @xmath17 to @xmath28",
    "nevertheless , we have to keep in mind that this is simply a typical estimate and the final value of @xmath31 can suffer a sizeable variation depending on many other factors not present in this simple estimate .    on the other hand , this has clear implications on the @xmath9 dependence of these off  diagonal entries of the sfermion mass matrices . in the basis where the down yukawa matrix is diagonal , we can write the up and down yukawas as , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix and @xmath35 the diagonalized mass matrices for the quarks",
    ". we can see in this equation that , for @xmath36 , the up yukawa matrix will maintain similar values when going to large @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the off  diagonal entries in the down squarks mass matrix will be roughly stable with @xmath9 . in the up squark mass matrix",
    "we have the opposite situation and the @xmath9 dependence is very strong . in this case",
    "the off  diagonal entries depend on the down yukawa matrix that grows linearly with @xmath9 for large @xmath9 .",
    "this means that we can expect the flavor change in the up and down squark mass matrix to be similar when @xmath37 . while for @xmath38 the flavor change in the up mass matrix will be approximately @xmath39 times smaller ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "these points also apply to the left ",
    "right sub ",
    "matrices where again flavor changing entries will be due to the opposite isospin yukawa matrix .",
    "in fact , this left ",
    "right sfermion mixing only appears after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the expression for these matrices in the sckm basis is , @xmath40 ) .",
    "this is always true for all the generation changing entries that are produced by the @xmath41 matrices .",
    "however , in the down mass matrix , this suppression can be partially compensated by a large value of @xmath9 in the diagonal terms proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "these are all well  known facts in the different studies of fcnc processes in the framework of the cmssm @xcite and imply that flavor mixing is still dominantly given by the usual ckm mixing matrix in w - boson , charged higgs and chargino vertices .",
    "in this work , we are especially interested in cp violating observables",
    ". then we must also consider the presence of observable phases in the sfermion mass matrices . in the following",
    "we will take the ckm matrix exactly real to isolate pure effects of the new supersymmetric phases @xcite .",
    "the sfermion mass matrices contain several physical phases that give rise to cp violation phenomena .",
    "in particular , before rge evolution , these phases ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are confined to the left - right part of the sfermion mass matrix while both the left  left , @xmath43 , and right  right , @xmath44 , matrices are real and diagonal .",
    "however this is not true anymore at @xmath28 : @xmath23 leaks into the off - diagonal elements of these hermitian matrices through rge evolution . from the explicit rge in the mssm , eq.([mqrge ] ) , it is clear that this phase only enters the @xmath45 evolution through the combinations @xmath46 or @xmath47 . at @xmath17",
    "these matrices have a common phase , and so the combination @xmath48 is exactly real .",
    "so , to the extent that the @xmath41 matrices keep a uniform phase during rge evolution , no phase will leak into the @xmath49 matrices .",
    "however , we can easily see from eqs.(a.2 ) and ( a.3 ) that this is not the case , and different elements of the @xmath41 matrices are renormalized differently . in this equation",
    ", we can see that only the terms involving two yukawa and one @xmath41 matrix can produce a mismatch in the phases .",
    "moreover , these terms will only be important when there are no small yukawas involved .",
    "then , we can expect a mismatch only on the off ",
    "diagonal elements involving the third generation . keeping this in mind , the general form of the @xmath49 matrix at @xmath28 in terms of the initial conditions is , @xmath50 where the coefficients @xmath51 are @xmath52 matrices with real numerical entries . in this expression",
    "we can see that the presence of imaginary parts will be linked to the non - symmetric part of the @xmath53 matrices . as is clear from the mass matrices in appendix a ( eqs .",
    "( a.5-a.7 ) and ( a.12-a.14 ) ) , these non  symmetric parts of @xmath54 are always more that three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding symmetric parts .",
    "this means that , in the sckm basis , the imaginary parts of any mass insertion are present only in one part per @xmath55 , and are always associated with @xmath56 mi , eqs .",
    "( a.8-a.11 ) and ( a.15-a.18 ) .",
    "a very similar situation was also found by bertolini and vissani , in the cmssm with vanishing susy phases for the leakage of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "so , we conclude that in the processes we will consider , we can take both @xmath57 and @xmath58 as real to a very good approximation .    in the following",
    "we will analyze the new effects of this model on indirect cp violation in @xmath59 and @xmath60 systems .",
    "in doing so , we will use both the exact vertex mixing method and the mass insertion ( mi ) approximation @xcite .",
    "notice that the mi approximation is extremely good in the case of the cmssm where all the off - diagonal entries are sufficiently small .",
    "the size of these off  diagonal entries directly gives in the mi approximation the amount of flavor changing induced by the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "a possible exception may arise in the stop and sbottom sectors that , in any case , could be diagonalized to ensure the validity of the mi approximation @xcite . as we will see in the next sections ,",
    "this is frequently useful to understand the exact results obtained in the vertex mixing method .",
    "in the sm neutral meson mixing arises at one loop through the well  known @xmath61box . however , in the cmssm , there are new contributions to @xmath62 processes coming from boxes mediated by supersymmetric particles .",
    "these are charged higgs boxes ( @xmath63 ) , chargino boxes ( @xmath64 ) and gluino - neutralino boxes ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the amount of the indirect cp violation in the neutral meson @xmath67 system is measured by the well  known @xmath68 parameter : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath67@xmath71 mass splitting .",
    "@xmath68 depends on the matrix elements of the @xmath62 hamiltonian , @xmath72 , which can be decomposed as @xmath73 where the relevant four  fermion operators are given by @xmath74 with @xmath75 for the @xmath59 and @xmath60systems respectively and @xmath76 as color indices . in the cmssm , these are the only three operators present in the limit of vanishing @xmath77 .    at this point , we are going to divide our discussion into two parts .",
    "we analyze separately the effective operator @xmath78 that preserves chirality along the fermionic line , and the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 that change chirality along the fermionic line . as we will see below the flavor mixing in the sfermion mass matrix and the experimental constraints on both kinds of operators are very different .      in eq.([df=2 ] ) , @xmath78 is the only operator present that does not involve a chirality change in the fermionic line .",
    "with respect to the associated sfermion , no chirality change in the sfermion propagator will be needed , and so , the suppression associated with left ",
    "right sfermion mixing can be avoided . in general , @xmath81 can be decomposed as follows @xmath82    the usual sm @xmath61box , where all the couplings are purely left ",
    "handed can only contribute to this effective operator .",
    "however , with @xmath83 , @xmath84 does not contain any complex phase and hence can not contribute to the imaginary part in @xmath85 . in any case",
    "it will always be , in the cmssm , the dominant contribution to @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , the charged higgs contribution , @xmath86 depends on the same combination of ckm elements with no other cp  violating phase @xcite .",
    "so it will not contribute to our cp violating observable .",
    "gluino and neutralino contributions to @xmath87 are specifically supersymmetric . they involve the superpartners of quarks and gauge bosons . here , the source of flavor mixing is not directly the usual ckm matrix .",
    "it is the presence of off  diagonal elements in the sfermion mass matrices , as discussed in the previous section . from the point of view of cp violation",
    ", we will always need a complex wilson coefficient . in the sckm basis",
    "all gluino vertices are flavor diagonal and real .",
    "this means that in the mi approximation , we need a complex mass insertion in one of the sfermion lines .",
    "as explained in the previous section , these mi are proportional to yukawa couplings and real up to 1 part in @xmath88 .",
    "the complete expressions for the gluino contributions to @xmath62 processes in the mi approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the bounds obtained there for the real and imaginary parts of the mass insertions required to saturate @xmath89 and @xmath2 are , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an average squark mass .    in the cmssm , as we can see in appendix a , these mass insertions are much smaller . in particular , the fact that the bound on @xmath89 , the real part of the mi , is satisfied implies that the imaginary parts are at least two orders of magnitude below the required value to saturate @xmath2 .",
    "hence , no sizeable contributions to @xmath2 from gluino boxes are possible .",
    "the situation in @xmath14@xmath15 mixing is completely analogous : assuming that the minimum phase from the mixing observable in the b  factories is around @xmath92 radians , we would need an imaginary contribution not more than one order of magnitude below the real one . with the arguments given above , this is clearly out of reach for gluino boxes in the cmssm .",
    "neutralino contributions are generally smaller than gluino due to smaller couplings with the same source of flavor mixing . in fact , although neutralino vertices in the sckm basis also involve the complex neutralino mixings , any imaginary part on this operator will only be due to a complex mass insertion .",
    "this can be seen in the explicit expressions in @xcite where all neutralino mixings in this operator appear in pairs with its complex conjugate counterpart .",
    "finally , the charginos also contribute to @xmath93 . in this case ,",
    "flavor mixing comes explicitly from the ckm mixing matrix , although off ",
    "diagonality in the sfermion mass matrix introduces a small additional source of flavor mixing .",
    "@xmath94 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 represent the coupling of chargino , @xmath98 , and squark @xmath99 to the left  handed down quark , @xmath100 .",
    "finally @xmath101 is an intermediate up ",
    "quark index associated with the factorization of the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "the expression for this coupling is then , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are @xmath105 matrices such that the @xmath106 unitary matrix @xmath107 diagonalizes the up  squark mass matrix , @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 is one of the matrices that diagonalize the chargino mass matrix through a bi  unitary transformation @xmath110 , with , @xmath111 from these equations it is clear that @xmath112 will in general be complex , as both @xmath24 and @xmath23 are present in the different mixing matrices .",
    "the loop function @xmath113 is given in eq .",
    "( b.1 ) of appendix b.    the main part of @xmath114 in eq([chwc ] ) will be given by pure ckm flavor mixing , neglecting the additional flavor mixing in the squark mass matrix @xcite .",
    "in this case , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we have , @xmath117 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but , taking into account that @xmath118 is symmetric under the exchange of any pair of arguments we have , @xmath119 and so @xmath120 , is exactly real @xcite .",
    "this is not exactly true in the cmssm , where there is additional flavor change in the sfermion mass matrices . here ,",
    "some imaginary parts appear in the @xmath114 in eq([chwc ] ) .",
    "being associated to the size of intergenerational sfermion mixings , these imaginary parts will be maximal for large @xmath9 . in fig([imk40 ] ) we show in a scatter plot the size of imaginary and real parts of @xmath114 in the k system for a fixed value of @xmath121 .",
    "the region of susy parameters explored in this and all of the following scatter plots is @xmath122 and @xmath123 . with these initial conditions we impose that all squarks are heavier than @xmath124 with the exception of the stops that , as the charginos , are only required to be above @xmath125 .",
    "furthermore we impose the constraint from the @xmath16 decay .",
    "notice that , as we will see later , this is a conservative attitude , in the sense that other constraints that we do not impose could only make our conclusions stronger . under these conditions , we can see here that , in the cmssm , this wilson coefficient is always real up to a part in @xmath126 .",
    "fig([imb40 ] ) is the equivalent plot for the case of @xmath14@xmath15 mixing . here , imaginary parts are relatively larger but , in any case , out of reach for the foreseen b  factories .    taking this into account , from the point of view of experimental interest , we will always neglect imaginary parts in the wilson coefficient @xmath127 within the cmssm .",
    "notice that this would not apply in a general model with non - universality at the gut scale @xcite , and each particular model should be considered separately .      from the point of view of flavor change and cp violation ,",
    "operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 are different from @xmath78 .",
    "these two operators always involve a change in the chirality of the external quarks , and consequently also a change of the chirality of the associated squarks or gauginos .",
    "in particular , this implies the direct involvement of the supersymmetric phases . on the other hand ,",
    "these operators are suppressed by the presence of down quark yukawa couplings , and so can only be relevant in the region of large @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we can write the different contributions to @xmath128 and @xmath129 as , @xmath130 in first place , charged higgs contributes only to @xmath128 , but parallel to the discussion for @xmath131 , the absence of phases prevents it from contributing to @xmath132 .",
    "gluino and neutralino boxes contribute both to @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "however flavor change will be given in this case by an off  diagonal left ",
    "right mass insertion . in the cmssm",
    "these mi are always proportional to the mass and are never enhanced by large @xmath9 values ( see eq.([lr ] ) ) of the right handed squark .",
    "this implies that these left ",
    "right flavor transitions from gluino will always be smaller in the cmssm than the corresponding chargino contributions , where flavor change is directly given by the ckm matrix .",
    "in fact , this is already well ",
    "known for the case of @xmath16 decay @xcite , which is completely equivalent from the point of view of flavor change .",
    "hence , the most important contribution , especially for light stop and chargino , will be the chargino box . before the inclusion of qcd effects",
    ", it contributes solely to the coefficient @xmath129 ,    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is the coupling of chargino , @xmath98 , and squark , @xmath99 , to the right  handed down quark @xmath100 , with , @xmath135 and @xmath136 is given in eq .",
    "( b.2 ) . unlike the @xmath114 wilson coefficient , @xmath137 is complex even in the absence of intergenerational mixing in the sfermion mass matrices @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of flavor violating entries in the up  squark mass matrix hardly modifies the results obtained in their absence @xcite .",
    "so , in these conditions we have , @xmath138\\\\ f_s(\\alpha , k,\\gamma , l , i , j)= \\frac{m_q^2}{2 m_w^2 \\cos^2 \\beta }   h^{(\\alpha , k)i}g^{(\\alpha , k)j * }   g^{(\\gamma , l)i * } h^{(\\gamma , l)j } y_2(z_{k } , z_{l } , s_i , s_j )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used ckm unitarity and degeneracy of the first two generations of squarks . due to the differences between @xmath139 and @xmath140 couplings , this contribution is always complex in the presence of susy phases .",
    "the most relevant feature of eqs.([chwcr ] ) and ( [ chwcr0 ] ) is the explicit presence of the external quark yukawa coupling squared , @xmath141 .",
    "this is the reason why this contribution is usually neglected in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , as we showed in @xcite , this contribution could be relevant in the large @xmath9 regime . for instance",
    ", in @xmath14@xmath15 mixing we have @xmath142 that for @xmath143 is larger than 1 and so , it is not suppressed at all when compared with the @xmath114 wilson coefficient .",
    "this means that this contribution can be very important in the large @xmath9 regime @xcite and could have observable effects in cp violation experiments in the new b  factories .",
    "however , in our previous work @xcite , we did not include the additional constraints coming from @xmath16 decay . in the next sections we will analyze the relation of @xmath132 with this decay , and the constraints imposed by its experimental measure .",
    "the decay @xmath16 has already been extensively studied in the context of the cmssm with vanishing susy phases @xcite . because the branching ratio is a cp conserving observable , the presence of new phases will not modify the main features found in @xcite concerning the relative importance of the different contributions .",
    "however , in the presence of the new susy phases , these contributions will have different phases and will be observable through the interference . as we will see next , the experimental constraints will also have a large impact on the imaginary parts of the decay amplitudes .",
    "this decay is described by the following @xmath144 effective hamiltonian @xmath145 where the relevant operators are given by @xmath146 here @xmath147 , and the wilson coefficients @xmath148 can be decomposed according with the particles in the loop , @xmath149    among these contributions , the @xmath61 penguin is exactly the same as in the sm and it does not depend on any supersymmetric parameters , it is simply a function of sm couplings and masses .",
    "this contribution is @xcite , @xmath150 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 the charge of the up quarks .",
    "similarly , in the charged higgs penguins all the variables are known with the exception of @xmath153 .",
    "again this contribution is unchanged by the inclusion of the new susy phases , @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "this contribution gives a sizeable correction to the @xmath16 decay that constrains the mass of the charged higgs in two higgs doublet models or in the mssm with low @xmath9 .",
    "however , in the case of moderate  large @xmath9 , chargino contributions may partially compensate this charged higgs contribution relaxing the constraints @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath156 and charged higgs contributions analyzed above , there are three specifically supersymmetric contributions mediated by gluino , neutralino and chargino . in gluino or neutralino diagrams",
    "flavor change is due to the off  diagonality in the sdown mass matrix .",
    "being left ",
    "right flavor off  diagonal transitions , they are suppressed by the mass of the @xmath157 quark . indeed , smallness of gluino and neutralino contributions has already been established in @xcite where it was shown that , in the cmssm , such contributions are roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the chargino contribution .    together with the @xmath158 and charged higgs , the most important supersymmetric contribution will be , especially in the large ",
    "moderate @xmath9 regime , the chargino contribution . in the @xmath61 and",
    "charged higgs contributions , the necessary chirality flip for the dipole amplitude is always proportional to @xmath159 . however , in the chargino penguin the chirality flip can be made either through a chargino mass insertion in the loop or through an external leg mass insertion proportional to @xmath159 .",
    "in fact , as pointed out in @xcite , this enhancement due to @xmath160 is partially compensated by the presence of the @xmath157 yukawa coupling .",
    "nevertheless , this compensation is only effective for low values of @xmath161 . in terms of the chargino  quark ",
    "squark couplings used in the previous section , these contributions are , @xmath162 with the loop functions defined in appendix b. similarly to the situation for the wilson coefficient @xmath129 , we can , to a very good approximation , neglect the presence of intergenerational mixing in the up  squark mass matrix @xcite , then , @xmath163 where , once more , we use ckm unitarity and degeneracy of the first two generations of squarks .    the second term in @xmath164 in eq . ( [ char ] ) , which corresponds to the chargino mass insertion in the loop , is dominant in the large @xmath9 regime .",
    "notice that both @xmath165 and @xmath166 are products of the squark and chargino mixing matrices that can be @xmath167 ( in the case of flavor  diagonal stop mixings ) .",
    "then , for stop and chargino masses around the electroweak scale , this term has an extra enhancement of @xmath168 .",
    "this means that , for large @xmath9 , we can approximate these wilson coefficients as , @xmath169",
    "as we have seen in section iii , chargino contribution to the @xmath129 wilson coefficient , eq.([chwcr0 ] ) , is the main contribution to indirect cp violation of the new supersymmetric phases for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , if we compare this wilson coefficient with the chargino contribution to the decay @xmath16 , eqs .",
    "( [ chwcr0 ] ) and ( [ char ] ) , we can see that both chargino contributions are deeply related .",
    "in fact , if we make a rough approximation and assume that the two different loop functions involved are of the same order , i.e. , @xmath170 we would obtain , @xmath171 of course , this can not be considered as a good approximation . as we can see from their explicit expressions in appendix b ,",
    "the loop functions are clearly different .",
    "anyway , they can be expected to give results of the same order of magnitude .",
    "so , the order of magnitude of @xmath129 is determined by the allowed values of @xmath172 , as we will explicitly show below .    to reach this goal , we will follow @xcite , where they constrain in a model  independent way new physics contributions to the wilson coefficients involved in the @xmath16 decay . in terms of these wilson coefficients , the branching ratio , @xmath0 is , @xmath173 + 0.161 re[\\xi_{8 } ] + 0.083 re[\\xi_{7}\\xi_{8}^ { * } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 . the different coefficients appearing in eq.([constrain ] ) are the sm renormalization group evolved contributions , that must be recovered in the limit @xmath175 .",
    "the numerical values are taken from @xcite .",
    "we have not taken into account the errors associated with the choice of the scale and the restrictions on the photon energy that do not modify our conclusions .",
    "now , using the experimental measure , @xmath176 , we can constrain the allowed values of the complex variables @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , we can already see from eq .",
    "( [ constrain ] ) , that in the approximation @xmath179 this is simply the equation of an ellipse in the @xmath180$]@xmath181 $ ] plane . in the case of supersymmetry with large @xmath9 ,",
    "the new physics contribution to @xmath177 and @xmath178 will be mainly due to the chargino . the allowed values of @xmath182 directly constrain then the chargino contributions to @xmath183 and indirectly constrain the values of @xmath184 .    in figure [ figc7 ] ,",
    "we show a scatter plot of the allowed values of @xmath185 versus @xmath186 in the cmssm for a fixed value of @xmath9 with the constraints from eq.([constrain ] ) .",
    "notice , that a relatively large value of @xmath9 , for example @xmath187 , is needed to compensate the @xmath61 and charged higgs contributions and cover the whole allowed area with positive and negative values .",
    "however , the shape of the plot is clearly independent of @xmath9 , only the number of allowed points and its location in the allowed area depend on the value considered . in this figure",
    "we take @xmath188 because only a large value could give rise to observable cp violation @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath172 and @xmath189 used here are the values obtained in the cmssm for a given set of initial conditions . although we do not use the approximation @xmath179 this does not modify the elliptic shape of the plot .",
    "figure [ figc3 ] shows the allowed values for a re  scaled wilson coefficient @xmath190 corresponding to the same allowed points of the susy parameter space in figure[figc7 ] .",
    "as we anticipated previously , the allowed values for @xmath191 are close to the square of the values of @xmath172 in figure [ figc7 ] slightly scaled by different values of the loop functions .",
    "this is the proof of the importance of the @xmath16 constraint on the chargino contributions to indirect cp violation .",
    "we can immediately translate this result to a constraint on the size of the chargino contributions to @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath192\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 denote the mass , mass difference and decay constant of the neutral meson @xmath196 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath197 @xcite includes the rge effects from @xmath28 to the meson mass scale , @xmath42 , and @xmath198 is the b ",
    "parameter associated with the matrix element of the @xmath80 operator @xcite .    then , for the @xmath59 system , using the experimentally measured value of @xmath199",
    "we obtain , @xmath200   \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-7 } im[\\bar{c}_3]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given the allowed values of @xmath191 in fig.[figc3 ] , this means that in the cmssm , even with large susy phases , chargino can not produce a sizeable contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "we have seen in section iii that also gluino and neutralino give negligible contributions in the cmssm or in a model without off  diagonal soft  breaking terms at the gut scale .",
    "hence indirect cp violation in the kaon system will be mainly given by the usual sm box and the presence of a cp violating phase in the ckm matrix , @xmath1 is still needed .",
    "the case of @xmath14@xmath15 mixing has a particular interest due to the arrival of new data from the b  factories .",
    "in fact , as explained at the end of section iii and in @xcite , in the large @xmath9 regime chargino contributions to indirect cp violation can be very important .",
    "however , for any value of @xmath9 we must satisfy the bounds from the @xmath16 decay .",
    "so , if we apply these constraints to the @xmath14@xmath15 mixing , @xmath201   \\approx 0.5 \\times 10^{-3 } im[\\bar{c}_3]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where once again , with the allowed values of fig.[figc3 ] we get a very small contribution to cp violation in the mixing . we must take into account that the mixing  induced cp phase , @xmath202 , measurable in @xmath14 cp asymmetries , is related to @xmath10 by @xmath203 .",
    "the expected sensitivities on the cp phases at the b factories are around @xmath204 radians , so this supersymmetric chargino contribution will be completely out of reach .",
    "gluino and neutralino contributions to indirect cp violation can also be discarded in the cmssm .",
    "once again we have to conclude that no new contributions to indirect cp violation from the new susy phases will be observable in @xmath14 cp asymmetries in the framework of the cmssm .",
    "recently , cdf @xcite has provided preliminary indications that @xmath205 is in agreement with the sm predictions . clearly , from the above result , eq .",
    "( [ epsb ] ) , it appears that the cmssm contribution is too small by itself to account for this result .",
    "in this work , the effects of non - vanishing supersymmetric phases on indirect cp violation in @xmath59 and @xmath60 systems have been analyzed within the cmssm .",
    "we have found that operators involving only left  handed external quarks are not sensitive to these new phases at an observable level .",
    "this is due to the absence of intergenerational mixings beyond those originated from the ckm matrix . on the contrary",
    ", operators involving both right and left ",
    "handed quarks are in general complex , even in the absence of @xmath1 , and could be relevant in the large @xmath9 regime .",
    "however , we have shown that these contributions are deeply related with the @xmath0 decay .",
    "so , taking into account the constraints coming from this decay these contributions also turn out to be too small to be measured experimentally .",
    "although these conclusions are specific for indirect cp violation , they could also be implemented for chargino mediated direct cp violation in the decays .",
    "again , in these decays the same chargino  quark ",
    "squark couplings are involved and we can also expect a big impact of the @xmath16 constrain .",
    "in fact , the conclusions reached in this paper are far more general .",
    "the correlation between @xmath16 and susy induced indirect cp violation exists in any supersymmetric model with sufficiently small intergenerational mixings in the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "this would include specifically all the models without new flavor structures beyond the usual ckm matrix at the gut scale and simplified models as the one the authors used in @xcite .    in summary , concerning the simpler supersymmetric models , like cmssm , the constraints coming from @xmath0 decay are sufficient to rule out pure supersymmetric indirect cp violation in @xmath59 and @xmath60 systems , even in the absence of any electric dipole moment constraints .",
    "this has very important consequences for the supergravity induced models where a cancellation between different supersymmetric contributions allows large supersymmetric phases while respecting edm bounds @xcite . in these models , even in the regions of parameter space where this cancellation occurs , no observable effect of the large susy phases will appear on indirect cp violation experiments",
    ". however , as pointed out by baek and ko @xcite , these phases would still be observable in cp asymmetries in the @xmath16 decay .",
    "all this means that the presence of large susy phases is not sufficient to produce observable effects at the low energy experiments .",
    "in particular , new sources of flavor change beyond the usual ckm matrix are needed . and",
    "so , any deviation from the sm expectations at indirect cp violation experiments due to supersymmetry should be taken as a sign of non  universality of the soft breaking terms . in this context one",
    "recalls the recent studies on superstring compactifications with non ",
    "universal gaugino masses @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we describe the new features of the integration of rge s in the cmssm with non - vanishing susy phases relevant to our analysis .",
    "the complete matrix form of the rg equations can be found in @xcite . using their notation and conventions , with the only change of @xmath206",
    ", we will mainly concentrate on the left  left scalar  quark mass matrix and the tri  linear soft breaking coupling evolution , @xmath207 \\nonumber + \\\\ & \\frac{1}{2 } [ \\tilde{y}_d\\tilde{y}_d^\\dagger m_q^2 + m_q^2 \\tilde{y}_d \\tilde{y}_d^\\dagger + 2 ( \\tilde{y}_d m_d^2 \\tilde{y}_d^\\dagger + \\bar{\\mu}^2_1   \\tilde{y}_d\\tilde{y}_d^\\dagger +   \\tilde{a}_d \\tilde{a}_d^\\dagger ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath208 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath209 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    except for the yukawa coupling matrices , the rge s of all other quantities are linear @xcite .",
    "this means , in particular , that rge s of all soft masses , though coupled , can be solved as a linear combination of the gut  scale parameters @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 at any scale below @xmath213",
    ". however , one notices that the initial conditions on the trilinear couplings require the knowledge of the particular yukawa texture at the unification scale . to do this",
    ", we numerically integrate the yukawa rge with a given value of @xmath9 and in terms of the fermion masses and the ckm matrix . specifying the gut ",
    "scale initial conditions in this way , it is straightforward to compute all soft masses at @xmath214 for arbitrary values of @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "thanks to the linearity of the corresponding rge s the soft masses at @xmath214 admit the following expansion , @xmath215 where the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath51 are @xmath52 matrices with real numerical entries .",
    "one notices that the matrices @xmath216 would be completely real were it not for the non  symmetric terms in the matrix @xmath217 .",
    "however , it will be seen from the specific examples that this matrix remains nearly symmetric , and thus , cp  violating entries @xmath216 are extremely suppressed .",
    "moreover , one notices that @xmath218 carries , in general , large cp violating phases ; however , these terms are effective only for intragenerational @xmath219-type mixings .",
    "hence , this particular observation shows the importance of chargino contributions for cp violation in fcnc processes , as explained in sec .",
    "ii .    as mentioned before , due to the non  linearity of the rge s for yukawa matrices , it is not possible to give a fully analytic solution for the soft mass parameters .",
    "nevertheless , once we fix @xmath220 , we can numerically integrate the yukawa rge .",
    "therefore , below we give semi  analytic solutions of rge s for @xmath221 and @xmath222 to illustrate the small and large @xmath220 regimes .",
    "fixing @xmath223 , we get for the relevant @xmath51 matrices in eq.([etas ] ) ,    @xmath224    where the vanishing off  diagonal entries in the last matrix mean values smaller than @xmath225 in absolute magnitude . among the matrices involved in eq.([etas ] ) , @xmath226 is always the largest one for similar values of @xmath212 and @xmath227 .",
    "so , it sets the scale of the matrix element while @xmath228 is the only one that can produce an imaginary part .",
    "hence , we do not specify the other @xmath51matrices , which are not important for our discussion .",
    "once we obtain the @xmath229 matrix with the help of eq.([etas ] ) we can get the values of the @xmath230 and @xmath231 in the sckm basis , that give the size of flavor change in the squark mass matrices compared with the diagonal elements . for @xmath221 ,",
    "those elements of the squark mass  squared matrix causing @xmath232 transitions between first and second , as well as second and third generations , are given by    @xmath233    now , we repeat the same quantities above for @xmath222 :    @xmath234    @xmath235    a comparison of the corresponding quantities in @xmath221 and @xmath222 cases reveals the sensitivity of the results on @xmath220 . as explained in sec .",
    "ii , @xmath236 remains nearly unchanged while @xmath237 assumes an order of magnitude enhancement as @xmath220 varies from 2 to 40 .",
    "this change in @xmath237 affects various quantities as dictated by the differential equations ( a.1  a.3 ) .",
