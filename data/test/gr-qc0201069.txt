    "theoretical physics faces nowadays a great challenge .",
    "there is four dimensional standard model on one side ( and the additional dimensions are not required to explain experimental data ) together with inflationary cosmology based on additional scalar fields @xcite . on the other side",
    "there is the completely supersymmetrical string / m - theory .",
    "building links between those approaches @xcite is a very motivating goal of modern physics which could be achieved by the study of microscopic black holes .",
    "as general relativity is not renormalizable , its direct standard quantization is impossible . to build a semiclassical gravitational theory ,",
    "the usual lagrangian should be generalized , which is possible in different ways .",
    "one of them is to study the action expansion in scalar curvature , _",
    "i.e. _ higher order curvature corrections . at the level of second order , according to the perturbational approach of string theory , the most natural choice is the 4d curvature invariant gauss - bonnet term @xmath0 @xcite .    with 4d action ,",
    "it is not possible to consider only @xmath1 because , being full derivative , it does not contribute to the field equations .",
    "it must be connected it with a scalar field @xmath2 to make its contribution dynamical .",
    "the following 4d effective action with second order curvature corrections can be built : @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the string coupling constant .",
    "as in cosmology , the most simple generalization of the theory ( a single additional scalar field ) is not possible because while dealing with spherically symmetric solutions , the `` no - hair '' theorem restriction must be taken into account .    treating @xmath2 as a dilatonic field , the coupling function @xmath5 is fixed from the first string principles and should be written @xmath6 @xcite , which leads to : @xmath7.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such type of actions can be considered as one of the possible middle steps between general relativity and quantum gravity . in this paper , we show that this effective string gravity model and its solutions can be applied for a description of the last stages of primordial black holes ( pbh ) evaporation @xcite and suggests possible dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "this should be understood in the general framework of gauss - bonnet black hole ( bh ) theory @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly recall previously obtained results and point out some new features important for this study , section iii is devoted to the establishment of the new hawking evaporation law ( especially for the detailed description of last stages of gauss - bonnet bh evaporation ) , in section iv we show that the direct experimental registration of such pbhs is impossible , section v is devoted to pbh relics as dark matter candidates and section vi contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "for the sake of completeness , main results from ref .",
    "@xcite are briefly repeated .",
    "starting from the action ( [ a11 ] ) , a static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat black hole solution is considered .",
    "one of the most convenient choice of metric in this model is @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "asymptotic expansion of the solution has the usual quasi - schwarzschild form , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are adm ( arnowit - dieser - misner ) mass and dilatonic charge respectively . using a dedicated code ,",
    "a bh type solution was obtained .",
    "this solution provides a regular horizon of quasi - schwarzschild type and the asymptotic behaviour near this horizon @xmath14 is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath14 are free independent parameters .    after solving the equations to the first perturbation order ,",
    "the following limit on the minimal bh size can be obtained : @xmath19 where @xmath4 is a combination of the string coupling constants ( _ fundamental value _ ) and @xmath20 is dilatonic value at @xmath14 , depending upon dilatonic value at infinity which can not be determined only in the framework of this model . according to this formula and taking into account the numerical values , the minimal bh mass has the order of planck one ( more precisely @xmath21 planck masses @xcite ) .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the stability of the solution under time perturbations at the event horizon was described in @xcite and was studied at the singularity @xmath22 in @xcite .",
    "contribution of higher order curvature corrections was studied in @xcite to show that , in the bosonic case with heterotic string models ( the question is still open in susy ii ) , all the new topological configurations are located inside the determinant singularity and , therefore , do not produce any new _ physical _ consequences .",
    "our conclusions remain valid when the next higher order curvature corrections are made of pure products of riemannian tensors .",
    "this topic is under additional investigation now .",
    "gathering these results , it can be concluded that the solution is stable in all the particular points , and , therefore , at all the values of initial data set .",
    "generalizing the model by taking into account the effective contribution of additional compact dimensions in the most simple form  scalar field  the action must be given as @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this model was studied into the details in @xcite . for current investigations",
    "it should be emphasized that when the contribution of moduli field value is considered , a naked singularity can appear if the size of additional dimensions is greater than the bh size .",
    "the minimal bh mass must therefore be increased to 10 planck masses ( to avoid being in naked singularity region ) .",
    "it is a key feature because it allows to move away from the planck region and to use _",
    "semiclassical approach_. if these additional dimensions were non - compact @xcite the bh minimal mass would be much greater .",
    "according to the analysis given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transition from prelast to last stage of bh evaporation is forbidden and evaporating pbhs will never reach the minimal mass state .",
    "the shape of the bh mass loss rate law changes and becomes the one presented in fig.2 , analogously to the simplified `` toy model '' presented in @xcite .",
    "different types of similar models for bh evaporation were studied in lovelock gravity @xcite , string inspired curvature expansions @xcite and in many other theories .",
    "the numerical values of gauss - bonnet bh ( important for experimental search analysis ) will be presented in section d.      in the wkb approximation of the hawking evaporation process , everything happens in the neighbourhood of the event horizon . as our metric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend upon radial coordinate @xmath26 and black hole mass @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( other variables are not important ) , we can use expansions ( [ a12 ] ) , taking into account only the first terms ( partially neglecting the dependence upon radial coordinate @xmath26 ) . using [ a12 ]",
    ", the metric can be written as : @xmath29    using the numerically calculated data , fits were performed for @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as we are interested mostly in the last stages of pbhs evaporation , where the difference from the standard bekenstein - hawking picture is considerable , taylor expansions around @xmath32 can be used .",
    "this also helps in obtaining good fits of the metric functions ( see fig.3 and fig.4 ) which can be considered as polynom expansions ( of @xmath12 or @xmath33 ) that are valid between @xmath34 and @xmath35 with good accuracy .",
    "@xmath36 where ( for @xmath37 ) the corresponding coefficients are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "using this technique , the pbh evaporation spectra and mass loss rate were derived in an analytical form ( valid only near the @xmath32 point ) .      in some approaches ,",
    "black holes are treated as immersed in a thermal bath and the evaporation can be described as a wkb approximation of semiclassical tunnelling in a dynamical geometry . in our investigation , we follow the techniques described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the same method was also applied in @xcite .",
    "some other descriptions of bh evaporation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the method from ref.@xcite and @xcite is that the energy of a particle changes its sign when crossing the bh horizon .",
    "so , a pair created just inside or just outside the horizon can become real with zero total energy after one member of the pair has tunnelled to the opposite side .",
    "the energy conservation plays a fundamental role : transitions between states with the same total energy are the only possible ones . using quantum mechanical rules",
    ", it is possible to write the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive energy particle which crosses the horizon outwards from @xmath46 to @xmath47 as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy of the particle , @xmath50 is total hamiltonian ( and total energy ) and the metric is written so as to avoid the horizon coordinate singularity .",
    "following @xcite , painleve s coordinates are used . the transformation to this metric from the schwarzschild one can be obtained by changing the time variable : @xmath51 substituting @xmath52 into ( [ e21 ] ) one obtains @xmath53    in wkb approximation , the imaginary part of the semiclassical action @xmath54 , describing the probability of tunnelling through the horizon is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is canonical momentum .    for gauss - bonnet bh",
    "the radial geodesics are described by the equation @xcite @xmath57    after substituting expression ( [ e41 ] ) to the equation ( [ e40 ] ) one obtains : @xmath58    substituting the expression ( [ a31 ] ) extended in ( [ e33 ] ) to the equation ( [ e44 ] ) , the imaginary part of the action can be written as : @xmath59 changing variables with @xmath60 @xmath54 takes the form @xmath61    as a result the imaginary part of the action is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a huge expression that can not be written here .",
    "it can be found at http://isnwww.in2p3.fr/ams/ims.ps .    using the numerical values for a realistic order of @xmath32 around 10 planck masses , the corresponding @xmath64 and @xmath65 , it is possible to find from ( [ a31 ] ) the approximate expression for @xmath54 .",
    "as we are interested mostly in the last stages of bh evaporation where the influence of higher order curvature corrections is important , the limit @xmath66 can be taken in the computations , leading to a very different spectrum than the standard bekenstein - hawking picture ( where @xmath67 ) .",
    "taking into account energy conservation , @xmath49 can be bounded : @xmath68 . the approximate expression of @xmath69 for a given @xmath32",
    "can then be used in the form @xmath70 where constant @xmath71 in planck unit values with a satisfying accuracy ( the plot of @xmath54 and its approximation are shown on fig.5 ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the emission spectrum per degree of freedom can simply be written as : @xmath72 @xmath73 being the absorption probability for a particle of spin @xmath74 and the heavyside function being implemented to take into account energy conservation with a minimal mass @xmath32 . in this section and in the following ones ,",
    "standard units are used instead of planck ones as numerical results should be obtained for experimental fluxes . at this point ,",
    "two questions have to be addressed : which kind of fields are emitted ( and which correlative @xmath75 have to be used ) and which mass range is physically interesting . to answer those questions ,",
    "the mass loss rate is needed : @xmath76 where the integration is carried out up to @xmath77 so as to ensure that the transition below @xmath32 is forbidden .",
    "the absorption probabilities can clearly be taken is the limit @xmath78 as we are considering the endpoint emission when the cutoff imposed by @xmath32 prevents the black hole from emitting particle with energies of the order of @xmath79 . using analytical formulae @xcite and expanding @xmath80 to the first order with the approximation according to ( [ e49 ] ) , it is easy to show that the emission of spin-1 particles , given by ( per degree of freedom ) @xmath81 dominates over s=1/2 and s=2 emission whatever the considered energy in the previously quoted limit .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the fermion emission around @xmath32 is not strongly modified by the edgb model as , in the lowest order , @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , if energy conservation was implemented as a simple cutoff in the hawking spectrum , the opposite result would be obtained : s=1/2 particles would dominate the mass loss rate as the power of @xmath83 in the absorption probability is the smallest one . if we restrict ourselves to massless particles , _",
    "i.e. _ the only ones emitted when @xmath12 is very close to @xmath32 , the metric modification changes the endpoint emission nature from neutrinos to photons .",
    "the real mass loss rate is just twice the one given here to account for the electromagnetic helicity states .    with this expression @xmath84 ,",
    "it is possible to compute the mass @xmath12 at any given time @xmath85 after formation at mass @xmath86 as : @xmath87 where only the dominant term in the limit @xmath88 is taken from the analytical primitive of the function .",
    "as expected , the result does not depend on @xmath86 which is due to the fact that the time needed to go from @xmath86 to a few times @xmath32 is much less than the time taken to go from a few times @xmath32 to @xmath12 as long as @xmath89 for @xmath90 . at time @xmath85 after formation",
    ", the mass is given by : @xmath91    this mass can be implemented in the emission spectrum formula :",
    "@xmath92 leading to a frequency f given by @xmath93    if we want to investigate the possible relic emission produced now from pbhs formed in the early universe with small masses , this leads to a frequency around @xmath94 with a typical energy of the order of @xmath95 ev .",
    "this emission rate is very small as it corresponds to the evaporation into photons with wavelength much bigger that the radius of the black hole .",
    "it should , nevertheless , be emphasized that the spectrum is a monophonically increasing function of energy , up to the cutoff , with a @xmath96 behaviour .",
    "furthermore , it shows that , although very small in intensity , the evaporation never stops and leads to a mass evolution in @xmath97 .",
    "we investigate in this section the possibility to measure the previously given relic emission .",
    "let @xmath98 be the distance from the observer , @xmath99 the redshift corresponding to the distance @xmath98 , @xmath100 the opening angle of the detector ( chosen so that the corresponding solid angle is @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 the individual differential spectrum of a black hole relic ( bhr ) at time @xmath85 , @xmath103 the numerical bhr density taking into account the cosmic scale factor variations , @xmath104 the horizon in the considered energy range , @xmath105 the age of the universe and @xmath50 the hubble parameter .",
    "the `` experimental '' spectrum @xmath106 ( j@xmath107s@xmath108sr@xmath109 ) can be written as : @xmath110 which leads to : @xmath111    this integral can be analytically computed and takes into account both the facts that bhrs far away from earth must be taken at an earlier stage of their evolution and that energies must be redshifted . even assuming the highest possible density of bhrs ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath104 around the universe radius , the resulting flux is extremely small : @xmath113 around @xmath114 ev , nearly 20 orders of magnitude below the background .",
    "this closes the question about possible direct detection of bhrs emission .",
    "another way to investigate differences between edgb black holes particle emission and a pure hawking spectrum is to study the mass region where @xmath115 is maximal .",
    "taking into account that the mass loss rate becomes much higher in the edgb case than in the usual hawking picture , it could have been expected that the extremely high energy flux was strongly enhanced . in particular",
    ", it could revive the interest in pbhs as candidates to solve the enigma of measured cosmic rays above the gzk cutoff .",
    "nevertheless , the spectrum modification becomes important only when the mass is quite near to @xmath32 .",
    "depending on the real numerical value of @xmath32 , it can vary substantially ( increasing with increasing @xmath32 ) but remains a few planck masses above @xmath32 .",
    "this is far too small to account for a sizeable increase of the flux .",
    "the number of particles emitted above @xmath116ev in a pure hawking model is of the order of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "this value should be taken with care as it relies on the use of leading log qcd computations of fragmentation functions far beyond the energies reached by colliders but the order of magnitude is correct .",
    "on the other hand , even if all the energy available when edgb modifications becomes important were released in @xmath116 ev particles ( which is not realistic ) it would generate only a few times @xmath118 particles and modify by less than 0.01% the pure hawking flux .",
    "it would not allow to generate , as expected , a spectrum harder than @xmath119 .",
    "the idea of pbh relics as a serious candidate for cold dark matter was first mentioned in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in a friedman universe without inflation , planck - mass remnants of evaporating primordial black holes could be expected to have close to the critical density .",
    "nevertheless , the study was based on the undemonstrated assumption that either a stable object forms with a mass around @xmath120 or a naked space - time singularity is left .",
    "our study provides new arguments favouring massive relic objects , probably one order of magnitude above planck mass and could revive the interest in such non - baryonic dark matter candidates .",
    "an important problem is still to be addressed in standard inflationary cosmology : the rather large size of the horizon at the end of inflation .",
    "the standard formation mechanism of pbhs requires the mass of the black holes to be of the order of the horizon mass at the formation time and only those created after inflation should be taken into account as the huge increase of the scale factor would extremely dilute all the ones possibly formed before .",
    "it is easy to show that under such assumptions the density of planck relics is very small : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the density of pbhs not yet evaporated , @xmath63 is the spectral index of the initial mass spectrum ( = 5/2 in the standard model for a radiation dominated universe ) , @xmath123 is the initial mass of a pbh which evaporating time is the age of the universe ( @xmath124 g ) and @xmath125 is the horizon mass at the end of inflation .",
    "this latter can be expressed as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the formation time and @xmath128 is the reheating temperature . even with the highest possible value for @xmath128 , around @xmath129 gev ( according to ref .",
    "@xcite if the reheating temperature is more than @xmath130 gev , bhr remnants should be present nowadays ) and the upper limit on @xmath122 coming from gamma - rays , around @xmath131 the resulting density is extremely small : @xmath132 .",
    "there are , nevertheless , at least two different ways to revive the interest in pbh dark matter . the first one is related to relics that would be produced from an initial mass spectrum decreasing fast enough , so as to overcome the gamma - rays limit",
    ". the second one would be to have a large amount of big pbhs , between @xmath117 g and @xmath133 g , where experiments are completely blind : such black holes are too heavy to undergo hawking evaporation and too light to be seen by microlensing experiments ( mostly because of the finite size effect @xcite ) . the most natural way to produce spectra with such features is inflationary models with a scale , either corresponding to a change in the spectral index of the fluctuations power spectrum @xcite either corresponding to a step @xcite .",
    "in this paper , the bh type solution of 4d effective string gravity action with higher order curvature corrections was applied to the description of bhrs .",
    "a corrected version of the evaporation law near the minimal bh mass was established .",
    "it was shown that the standard bekenstein - hawking evaporation forluma must be modified in the neighbourhood of the last stages .",
    "our main conclusion is to show that contrarily to what is usually thought the evaporation does not end up by the emission of a few quanta with energy around planck values but goes asymptotically to zero with an infinite characteristic time scale .",
    "the direct experimental registration of the products of evaporation of bhrs is impossible .",
    "this gives an opportunity to consider these bhrs as one of the main candidates for cold dark matter in our universe .",
