    "the absorption features in bal quasars are not easy to interpret because the bal region may cover only a part of the background source(s ) ( hamann 1998 , arav 1997 ) .",
    "partial covering along the line of sight is common in narrower intrinsic absorbers ( e.g. barlow , hamann , and sargent 1997 ) , but more difficult to determine in bal quasars where the strong doublets of si iv and c iv are typically blended into wide features . in narrower intrinsic absorption systems , the partial covering is both ion and velocity dependent ( barlow and sargent 1997 ) .",

    "the observed smoothness of the bal features in hires spectra rules out a `` picket fence '' model for the bals . a `` picket fence '' model ( partial covering by turbulent components in velocity space )",
    "was proposed by kwan ( 1990 ) in order to explain the relative weakness of the h i ly @xmath5 bal without resorting to non  solar chemical abundances or partial covering along the line of sight .",
    "the smooth bal features also imply a large number of `` clouds '' in the bal region if the bal region is composed of clouds rather than a smooth outflow .    in order to quantify the smoothness of the bal features , the c",
    "iv bal in q1246@xmath4047 has been divided by a piecewise polynomial .",
    "a small number of polynomials of low order were used to preserve residual fluctuations on scales less than @xmath1 200 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the result of that division is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the entire c iv bal feature spans absorption velocities from 10 000 km s@xmath2 to 27 000 km s@xmath2 .    in the c iv bal , from 4700   to 4760   ( chosen because the optical depth is roughly constant ) , there are 375 8.8 km s@xmath2 bins .",
    "each bin is four pixels , about the fwhm resolution for this hires spectrum .",
    "if we ignore the fact that the bins are not completely independent and and also ignore the doublet nature of the c iv transition , an estimate of the number of independent `` clouds '' can be made from the noise in the divided c iv spectrum . the residual intensity is assumed to be given by @xmath6 = @xmath7 with @xmath8 = @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of clouds contributing to the absorption in each bin and @xmath11 is the optical depth per cloud . if the clouds obey a simple gaussian distribution with its @xmath12 rms variation in number , then the rms fluctuations in the divided spectrum , @xmath13 = @xmath14 , will be given by : @xmath15 = @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 is the smooth fit to the data .",
    "putting in the observed @xmath19 and @xmath20 in this wavelength range , gives n @xmath1 300 clouds and multiplying by 375 bins gives @xmath21 clouds .",
    "this is a very crude estimate , but it is clear that a large number of clouds are needed to make a smooth trough .",
    "the residuals observed are at a level slightly higher than expected from the noise estimate in the spectrum ( @xmath22 , while 1.0 is expected if purely from noise ) .",
    "given the process of piecing together the hires spectral orders , fitting a continuum , and then fitting the trough with a piecewise polynomial , it is possible that all of the observed variation is noise plus some fitting errors .",
    "this analysis is most sensitive to a large number of clouds at the resolution of the observation . above a few hundred km s@xmath2 , for the c iv trough in q1246 - 057 ,",
    "some structure is removed by the polynomial fit used to model the smooth trough .",
    "the bin size can easily be varied and repeating this exercise shows that for `` cloud '' ( or component ) widths from 5 to 200 km s@xmath2 a large number ( @xmath23 ) of clouds is needed .",
    "the assignment of a typical velocity width for a typical cloud is uncertain because the physical mechanism behind bal cloud confinement is not known .",
    "photoionization at parsec distances or greater leads to a much larger number of very small individual clouds and small filling factors ( e.g. junkkarinen , burbidge , and smith 1987 ) .",
    "velocity widths @xmath1 8 km s@xmath2 ( fwhm ) are produced by thermal broadening for carbon at t @xmath1 15 000 k , near the temperature expected from photoionization equilibrium .",
    "the smoothness of the troughs in bal quasars like q1246@xmath4057 may instead indicate a smooth outflow .",
    "models that avoid the need for small clouds have been calculated by murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in these models",
    "the emission and absorption regions are both formed very close to the central engine ( starting point as near as @xmath10.003 pc ) , and the absorption is produced by a smooth outflow that crosses the line of sight at an angle .",
    "the conventional analysis of bal spectra involves the extraction of absorption templates from the data .",
    "doublets like c iv @xmath24 1548.2,1550.8 and si iv @xmath24 1393.8,1402.8 , can be iteratively corrected for the weaker line ( junkkarinen , burbidge , and smith 1983 ) to produce optical depth versus velocity .",
    "these templates are shifted to the wavelengths of other transitions and scaled in a @xmath25 fitting procedure to match the data and give approximate ( lower limit ) column densities ( e.g. korista et al .",
    "1992 ) . because bal quasars like q0226@xmath41024 ( fig .",
    "2 ) and q1246@xmath4057 have smooth troughs    with no apparent features at scales around 30 km s@xmath2 , spectra obtained at the hires resolution ( typically 7 - 9 km s@xmath2 fwhm ) can be smoothed to produce high quality templates .",
    "figure 3 shows the c iv and si iv absorption templates extracted from    our keck hires spectrum of q0226@xmath41024 .",
    "the spectra were smoothed to produce these templates and could be further smoothed without losing any of the apparent structure . at the hires resolution of 7 km",
    "s@xmath2 fwhm for q0226@xmath41024 and at a resolution of 9 km s@xmath2 fwhm for q1246@xmath4057 the troughs are completely resolved .",
    "the troughs are not without structure as is illustrated in the case of q0226@xmath41024 . the lowest velocity bal feature ( marked `` 1 '' in figs .",
    "2 & 3 ) breaks up into three `` spikes '' of absorption repeated in both c iv and si iv .",
    "these features are not resolved with @xmath26 spectra .",
    "analyzing bal quasar spectra using multiple templates that cover only a part of the velocity space may be possible when the bals occur in clumps well separated in velocity .",
    "troughs 1 and 2 in q0226@xmath41024 are narrower than the si iv @xmath24 1393.8,1402.8 doublet .",
    "trough 2 shows partial covering in si iv with @xmath27 based on measurements of the doublet using : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the residual intensities in the stronger and weaker lines in the doublet ( e.g. hamann et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the template extraction procedure assumes full covering and produces a false absorption feature around 7500 km s@xmath2 in the extracted template ( marked `` art.''fig .",
    "3 ) . such weak , echo  like features and regions where the template goes negative are indications that the assumption of complete coverage of the background source has broken down .",
    "artifacts can also be produced by a poor choice of continuum , so the templates must be evaluated allowing for some uncertainty in the continuum .",
    "for very wide features with smooth edges compared to the doublet separation , like trough 3 in c iv in q0226@xmath41024 , it is easy to construct partial covering models that mimic the data .",
    "the data are consistent with either 100% covering over those velocities or with high optical depths and a covering function that is chosen to produce the shape of the observed feature .",
    "the important issue of partial covering dominating the shape of the broad bal troughs is not one that is easily resolved .",
    "the bals in q1246@xmath4057 and q0226@xmath41024 are found to be smooth and completely resolved in the keck hires spectra at a resolution of 7  9 km s@xmath2 fwhm .",
    "the smoothness of the c iv trough in q1246@xmath4057 leads to an estimate of at least @xmath31 clouds ( or components ) of width 5 to 200 km s@xmath2 comprising the deepest part of the trough .",
    "keck hires spectra are a good source for generating absorption templates for analyzing lower resolution ground based and hst uv spectra of bal quasars .",
    "the spectrum of q0226@xmath41024 shows bal features with structure that is not resolved in low resolution spectra .",
    "the q0226@xmath41024 si iv template also shows artifacts produced by a breakdown of the assumption of complete covering of the background source . in broader bal features ( broad relative to the doublet separation ) ,",
    "the effects of optical depth and partial covering are not easy to separate .",
    "spectropolarimetry ( e.g. cohen et al .",
    "1997 ) or photoionization equilibrium analysis could yield estimates of the partial covering and the true column densities in the broad features ."
