    "the interaction among oscillators in a system not only leads them into a cooperative dynamics but also often quenches their oscillations .",
    "there are two dynamically different oscillation quenching phenomena which are termed as amplitude death ( ad ) and oscillation death ( od ) @xcite . in ad , the amplitude of oscillation quenches to zero , whereas od is caused by quenching in the frequency of oscillation @xcite .",
    "it is also defined that ad occurs via the stabilization of a homogeneous steady state ( hss ) while od occurs via the stabilization of an inhomogeneous steady state @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms underlying these two quenching phenomena have been identified recently and the results show that the parametric mismatch @xcite , dynamic @xcite , time delay @xcite and nonlinear couplings @xcite underly ad , while od occurs mainly because of the symmetry breaking coupling in the system @xcite . recently ,",
    "diverse routes of transition from the ad to od have also been reported @xcite .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies show definitive evidence of oscillation quenching in realistic systems ranging from biological @xcite , chemical @xcite , electronic @xcite and laser @xcite systems to climate @xcite systems .",
    "such oscillation quenching in many cases leads to undesirable situations . in the interaction between neuronal dynamics and brain metabolism , the decrease in cerebral metabolic rate ,",
    "coupled with the stabilizing properties of atp - gated potassium channels , leads to a burst suppression in the eeg pattern which symbolizes inactivated brain @xcite .",
    "this type of suppression results in hypothermia , coma and ohtahara syndrome , a type of early infantile encephalopathy and is also observed during deep levels of anesthesia .",
    "the suppression of normal sinus rhythm of pacemaker cells causes cardiac arrest @xcite .",
    "owing to the fatal consequences due to oscillation suppression , interesting efforts have been undertaken to retrieve / resurrect oscillations of the system @xcite . in @xcite , the oscillation death in diffusively",
    "coupled oscillators has been found to be eliminated through a spatial disorder in the form of parametric mismatch and in ref .",
    "@xcite processing delay is used to revoke oscillations successfully in delay coupled systems .",
    "regarding the above mentioned issues , in this article , we demonstrate that the problem can also be well resolved by providing a suitable feedback in the system .",
    "the latter can be found to be present in most of the natural systems , including neural networks @xcite , genetic networks @xcite , vision systems @xcite , etc .",
    "the vital role of feedback in controlling the dynamics of the given system and the control over synchronization @xcite are already known , which can be seen in a variety of fields ranging from electronics @xcite , biology to quantum information @xcite .",
    "for example , the feedback control of deep brain simulation has been found to be the most effective treatment for chronic neural diseases like essential tremor , dystonia and parkinson s disease @xcite .",

    ", we show the applicability of the feedback technique in resurrecting oscillations in a wide range of systems .",
    "we show both numerically and analytically that the addition of feedback destabilizes the stable attractors which results in a wiping out of the oscillation quenching and inducing a resurrection of oscillations .",
    "in addition , by considering a rather general system , we prove analytically the above destabilizing nature over the ad state .",
    "further , it will be more important to develop an adaptable mechanism thereby improving the ones available in the literature at present .",
    "this is because , for example to use the available parametric mismatch method , one needs to tune the internal parameters of the system , while the processing delay also depends on the underlying process of the system where that process may be unknown in many situations so as to hinder the efficiency .",
    "in contrast , the feedback method suggested here can be given more easily which is already in practice under different contexts such as in deep brain simulation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above adaptable nature of feedback , with the aid of numerical and analytical studies , we show the important fact that this method does not impose a restriction that the output of all the oscillators need to be fedback . from the output of only a few of the system oscillators ,",
    "we show that in typical systems the resurrection of oscillations can be achieved easily .",

    "this model is often used in neural networks to model spiking neurons @xcite .",
    "the first reason for using the model in neural networks is that the periodically spiking neurons have an exponentially stable limit cycle attractor and secondly the real part of the complex amplitude of the stuart - landau oscillator can describe the membrane voltage in the neurons and the imaginary part can be related to the recovery variable embedding the effects of the other variables of physiological neuron models @xcite .",

    "<S> the quenching of oscillations in interacting systems leads to several unwanted situations , which necessitate a suitable remedy to overcome the quenching . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> , this work addresses a mechanism that can resurrect oscillations in a typical situation . through both numerical and analytical studies , </S>",
    "<S> we show the candidate which is capable of resurrecting oscillations is nothing but the feedback , the one which is profoundly used in dynamical control and in bio - therapies . even in the case of a rather general system , we demonstrate analytically the applicability of the technique over one of the oscillation quenched states called amplitude death state . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some of the features of this mechanism such as adaptability of the technique with the feedback of only a few of the oscillators . </S>"
