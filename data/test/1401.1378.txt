    "as early as 1934 , w.  elsasser noticed the existence of `` special numbers '' of neutrons and protons that confer to the corresponding nuclei a particularly stable configuration  @xcite .",
    "in analogy with atomic electrons , he correlated these numbers with closed shells in a model of non - interacting nucleons occupying energy levels generated by a potential well .",
    "it took 15 more years until mayer , haxel , suess and jensen  @xcite showed that this nuclear potential could be modeled by a one - body harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , an l@xmath2 term and a spin - orbit ( so ) potential to give rise to the ho shell gaps at 8 , 20 , 40 and so shell gaps at 28 , 50 , 82 and 126 . in 1954",

    "these combined works of elliott and talmi and unna introduced the possibility of shell evolutions due to specific two - body nuclear forces .",
    "it took however about 20 more years until the combined works of thibault  @xcite , hubert  @xcite , dtraz  @xcite and guillemaud - mueller  @xcite on atomic masses , nuclear radii and nuclear spectra demonstrated the first disappearance of a magic shell ( n=20 ) and the onset of collectivity far from stability . on the theoretical point of view the works of campi , poves and warburton  @xcite described this onset of collectivity as due to the combination of a shell gap reduction and the excitations of particles from the normally occupied orbital to the first orbital of the upper shell , often referred to as _ intruder orbit_. some nuclei , in which the ordering of the intruder and normal configurations is inverted belong to the so - called `` island of inversion ''  @xcite .",

    "two different regimes can be distinguished in this figure , with a turning point at z=14 , as already found for the n=20 isotones . above z=14",

    "this means that nuclear forces between the protons in these orbits and neutrons in the two orbits forming the n=20 gap are almost the same .",
    "the spacing between the 7/2@xmath36 and 3/2@xmath36 states , which traditionally forms the n=28 gap ( very small here @xmath43 1 mev ) , decreases slightly between z=14 and z=16 and increases afterwards until z=20 .",

    "the 7/2@xmath36 and 3/2@xmath36 states are swapped and the n=20 gap collapses . even if states are not of fully single particle origin , this drastic trend should carry valuable information upon the intensity of the proton - neutron forces involved here and their spin , angular momentum and radial overlap dependencies . to give an example on the spin dependance , while the 3/2@xmath15 and 7/2@xmath36 spacing is unchanged by adding four protons in the 1d@xmath9 orbit from z=16 to z=20 , it increases by about 1.2 mev by adding four protons in the 1d@xmath4 orbit from z=10 to z=14 .",
    "an even more dramatic effect occurs for the 7/2@xmath36 and 3/2@xmath36 spacing which increases by 1 mev ( 2 mev ) with the filling of the d@xmath9 ( d@xmath4 ) orbit .",
    "note that the results on the 3/2@xmath15 , 7/2@xmath36 and 3/2@xmath36 states in @xmath44ne obtained through ( d , p ) reaction also confirm that a reduction of the 3/2@xmath15  7/2@xmath36 spacing and a swapping between the 7/2@xmath36 and 3/2@xmath36 states take place between the @xmath45si and @xmath44ne isotones  @xcite , as between the @xmath46si and @xmath41ne isotones .",
    "we shall see in the next section that these modifications can be intuited using known properties of the nuclear force .",
    "we shall then propose that a universal mechanism , based on the hierarchy of few nuclear forces , is expected to provide these significant shell evolutions and re - ordering around n=20 , but also in other regions of the chart of nuclides .",
    "as shown above , a significant change in the energy of the neutron orbits 1d@xmath9 , 1f@xmath5 and 2p@xmath9 occurs when changing the occupancy of the proton 1d@xmath4 orbit . by using simple properties of the nuclear force",
    ", we can show that the corresponding two - body proton - neutron forces v@xmath47 at play here follow this hierarchy @xmath48v@xmath49v@xmath50v@xmath51 .",
    "indeed the nucleon wave functions are characterized by the number of nodes @xmath52 of the radial part , the angular momentum @xmath53 and spin orientation with respect to the angular momentum . when the proton and neutron wave functions have the same @xmath52 and @xmath53 values and opposite spin orientations with respect to @xmath53 , the amplitude of the corresponding interaction is maximized  @xcite . as @xmath48v@xmath54 @xmath48 contains all these properties , it has the largest intensity . on the other extreme ,",
    "when @xmath52 differs , the protons and neutrons radial wave functions oscillate out of phase , hereby reducing their overlap considerably ( see the schematic view of fig .  [ hierarchyfig ] ) . added to the fact that the proton and neutron angular momenta differ by one unit and that the proton and neutron spin orientations are aligned , the @xmath48 v@xmath55@xmath48 interaction has all reasons to be very weak .",
    "the remaining interaction @xmath48v@xmath56@xmath48 falls in the middle , @xmath52 is similar for protons and neutrons , but their @xmath53 values differ by one unit , and their spin are aligned with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "we let the reader find that such a clean hierarchy can not be obtained when filling the proton 1d@xmath9 orbital during which no such drastic changes in the spacing between neutron orbits is observed .",
    "this hierarchy of proton - neutron forces derived at n=17 applies as well to the regions south to @xmath7si and @xmath57si , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hierarchyfig ] . below @xmath7si ,",
    "this accounts for the reduction of the n=20 gap and a likely swapping between the neutron 7/2@xmath36 and 3/2@xmath36 states . below the deformed @xmath57si nucleus",
    ", the size of the n=28 gap between the f@xmath5 and p@xmath9 orbits is expected to be further reduced .",
    "it follows that n=28 isotones , as @xmath58 mg , will be also deformed as seems to be indicated by the recent work on the neutron - rich @xmath59 mg isotopes @xcite . then no sharp drop in s@xmath33",
    "is expected at ( z@xmath6014,n=28 ) , but rather a smooth variation , bringing the drip - line further from stability as observed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as there is no n=20 effect as well in the mg isotopic chain , it follows as suggested in ref.@xcite that a merging of the two islands of inversions n=20 and n=28 is occurring there .",
    "interesting extrapolations of this hierarchy of forces to other regions of the chart of nuclides can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hierarchyfig ] . by changing all involved proton and neutron angular momenta by one unit",
    ", other shell gaps are concerned .",
    "indeed , by applying @xmath61 , the proton orbit becomes 1f@xmath5 , while the neutron orbits are 1f@xmath4 , 1g@xmath6 and 2d@xmath4 . between these neutron orbits the n=40 and 50 are formed , the intensity of which depends on the action of proton - neutron forces involved .",
    "starting from the @xmath62ni nucleus , the size of the n=40 gap between 1f@xmath4 ( or 2p@xmath42 ) and 1g@xmath6 as well as of the n=50 gap between the 1g@xmath6 and 2d@xmath4 are expected to be reduced significantly when moving toward @xmath10ca ( see for instance the predictions of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these latter orbits can eventually be inverted there , as proposed in the theoretical calculations of  @xcite that use realistic interactions .",
    "this hierarchy of forces will also impact the structure of nuclei south to @xmath11ni by reducing the n=50 gap there .",
    "the last extrapolation ( @xmath61 ) will bring us into the region below @xmath63sn .",
    "this is a region in which the r - process spend enough time to build the a@xmath43130 peak in the abundance curve of the elements .",
    "the location , height and shape of this peak could be traced back from the neutron separation energies ( s@xmath64 ) , the half - lives ( t@xmath42 ) , the neutron delayed emission probabilities ( @xmath65 ) , and the neutron - capture cross sections ( @xmath66 ) of the nuclei located around the @xmath67 shell closure .",
    "they vary with the structural evolution of the nuclei . using the hierarchy @xmath48v@xmath68v@xmath69 v@xmath70 both the size of the n=82 gap and the energy between the neutron 1h@xmath71 and 1g@xmath5 orbits",
    "are expected to be reduced far from stability ( see fig .  [ hierarchyfig ] ) .",
    "we can anticipate two important consequences for the r - process .",
    "first the reduction of the n=82 gap is expected to change the location of the r - process path , changing the shape of the r - process peak accordingly . instead of being all accumulated at n=82 ,",
    "isotopes with lower neutron number will become r - process progenitors , filling the low - mass wing of the a=130 peak .",
    "second the @xmath29-decay half - lives t@xmath42 , that mainly depend on the gt transition @xmath721g@xmath731g@xmath6 , will be drastically shortened far from stability  @xcite , speeding up the r - process accordingly .",
    "indeed as t@xmath42 scales with the phase factor value 1/(q@xmath74-e*)@xmath75 , where e * is the energy to which the gt transition occurs , the reduction of the neutron 1g@xmath5 ",
    "1h@xmath71 spacing is decreasing e * and shortening the half - lives t@xmath42 of the nuclei that are paving the r - process . therefore",
    "the proton - neutron interaction strongly influence the half - lives values in the n=82 isotones .",
    "to finish this section few remarks can be put forward .",
    "_ first _ , we proposed that a hierarchy of nuclear forces is applicable to several regions of the chart of nuclides , leading to significant shell evolutions .",
    "very recent calculations using realistic forces have been made for the o ( ca ) isotopic chain , showing that the inversion between the neutron fp ( gd ) shell has occurred when reaching the drip line .",
    "this simplified vision of the hierarchy of nuclear forces somehow finds echo with the properties of realistic forces .",
    "_ second _ , the same forces play a role while changing occupancies of the proton orbits 1d@xmath4 , 1f@xmath5 and 1g@xmath6 by up to 6 , 8 and 10 protons , respectively .",
    "a relatively good predictive power of the evolution of shells is therefore expected far from stability , provided that the aforementioned interactions are well constrained in a given region of mass .",
    "_ third _ , correlations have to be taken into account to fully model the nuclei along the regions shown in fig .",
    "[ hierarchyfig ] .",
    "_ fourth _ , in the n=82 region other shells are present between the major ones mentioned above . while they are not expected to change this global picture",
    ", they act to dilute the action of the aforementioned nuclear forces as other intermediate shells are filled .",
    "it is therefore expected that structural evolutions will be occurring more slowly in heavy nuclei .",
    "this could explain why recent isomer studies on the n=82 isotones of @xmath76cd ( z=48 ) and @xmath77pd ( z=46 ) @xcite do not indicate that a change in nuclear structure has yet occurred there .",
    "important is however to note that these two experiments are rather sensitive to proton configurations ( g@xmath78 and rather indirectly to neutron configurations .",
    "therefore , a more direct evolution of neutron single - particle energies should be probed there in the future in order to see if the n=82 gap is reduced below z=50 . _",
    "fifth _ , the same hierarchy seems also applicable to lighter nuclei to account for the evolution of the neutron 2s@xmath42 , 1p@xmath42 and 1d@xmath4 orbits when the proton 1p@xmath9 is filled in the n=7 isotones between the recently studied @xmath79he @xcite and @xmath80c .",
    "in the previous sections , it was assumed that the proton - neutron nuclear forces do not change when approaching the neutron drip - line . there , a large asymmetry is present between the proton and neutron binding energies .",
    "while the proton is deeply bound and its wave function well confined inside the nucleus , the neutron is weakly bound and its wave function can extend out of the mean nuclear radius .",
    "in such a case , the overlap of their wave functions is reduced and the effective proton - neutron interaction is weakened .",
    "this change in effective interaction depends on the binding energy of the neutron and its angular momentum .",
    "indeed when the neutron centrifugal barrier is high as compared to the binding energy of the unbound neutron , it can be considered as quasi - bound and the effective interaction can be similar to that in the valley of stability .",
    "several experimental works are being carried out worldwide ( e.g.  @xcite ) to probe the structure of unbound states and theoretical works are treating the interaction with the continuum explicitly  @xcite .        as described in ref.@xcite the @xmath81f@xmath82 nucleus is a suitable choice for studying the proton - neutron d@xmath4-d@xmath9 interaction that has a decisive role for changing the n=20 gap when approaching the drip lines .",
    "the binding energies of all states of the multiplet @xmath83 arising from the @xmath84d@xmath85d@xmath9 coupling in @xmath81f@xmath82 were determined using four experimental techniques ( time of flight measurement for the j=1 ground state  @xcite ) , in - beam @xmath27-ray spectroscopy for the j=2 state  @xcite , m3 isomer decay study for the j=4 state  @xcite , and in - beam neutron spectroscopy for the unbound j=3 state  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding proton - neutron interaction energy , int(j ) , was determined in @xcite from the difference between the experimental binding energy of a state j in @xmath38f and that of the @xmath37o+1p+1n system , in which proton and neutron are free of interaction ( int=0 ) .",
    "[ int ] compares the experimental results to shell model ( sm ) calculations using the usda interaction fitted to nuclei close to the valley of stability and to coupled cluster ( cc ) calculations that use interactions from chiral effective field theory , the treatment of three - body forces and the interaction with the continuum .",
    "comparison with sm calculations shows that the experimental binding energy is globally weaker than expected by about 17% , and that the multiplet of j=1 - 4 states is compressed by about 25% .",
    "these discrepancies possibly point out the deficiencies of the sm that is treating nucleon interactions using a harmonic oscillator potential basis that is not suited for taking the proton - to - neutron binding energy asymmetry and continuum effects into account . on the other hand cc calculations , in which the weak binding energy of the neutron is considered explicitly , agree with experimental results .",
    "further studies on other nuclei should be carried out to confirm the present findings upon the proton - neutron interaction when approaching the drip - line .",
    "the field of nuclear structure far from stability is experiencing tremendous breakthroughs .",
    "benchmarking nuclei as @xmath37o , @xmath57si , @xmath86ca , @xmath87cr , @xmath88sn and @xmath12sn - to quote a few - have been or are on the way to be studied .",
    "extremes of isospin , ranging from the proton to neutron drip lines were probed , as for instance between @xmath89f@xmath90 and @xmath91f@xmath92 . when sorting out the data available to date , amazingly similar pictures arise throughout the chart of nuclides , which have been recently identified to take root from specific properties of the nuclear force and from nuclear correlations . the magic nuclei n= 8 , 20 and 40 ( leading to so - called ho shell gaps ) all disappear far from stability , leading to three islands of inversion through the same mechanism .",
    "it was proposed here that the reduction of the n=8 , 20 , and 40 shell gaps and the swapping between certain levels arise from a simple hierarchy between proton - neutron forces .",
    "this hierarchy was applied to yet unexplored regions of the chart of nuclides such as below @xmath57si , @xmath87cr , @xmath11ni or below @xmath12sn where the r - process nucleosynthesis is accumulating peaks in the r abundance curve of the elements . as for the the growing of the so - called so shell gaps at n=14 , 28 and 50 by about 2.7 mev , it is likely due to three - body neutron - neutron forces ,",
    "which were only recently implemented in theoretical models .",
    "these remarkable successes and similarities in different regions of the chart of nuclides however reach limit when looking at the evolution of so shell gaps far from stability .",
    "for so far unknown reasons , the valence mirror nuclei built on proton and neutron so numbers such as @xmath93c@xmath94 , @xmath95si@xmath96 and @xmath63sn@xmath97 , behave totally differently .",
    "the first two are deformed , while the latter is a doubly magic nucleus",
    ". it will be therefore very important to study the @xmath98ni@xmath99 nucleus , which lies in between , to better understand why similar forces do not reach the same effect there .",

    "<S> during the last 30 years , and more specifically during the last 10 years , many experiments have been carried out worldwide using different techniques to study the shell evolution of nuclei far from stability . </S>",
    "<S> what seemed not conceivable some decades ago became rather common : all known magic numbers that are present in the valley of stability disappear far from stability and are replaced by new ones at the drip line . by gathering selected experimental results , </S>",
    "<S> beautifully consistent pictures emerge , that very likely take root in the properties of the nuclear forces.the present manuscript describes some of these discoveries and proposes an intuitive understanding of these shell evolutions derived from observations . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations to yet unstudied regions , as where the explosive r - process nucleosynthesis occurs , are proposed . some remaining challenges and puzzling questions </S>",
    "<S> are also addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 : the present manuscript is a summary of a plenary talk given at the 25@xmath1 international nuclear physics conference ( inpc ) , firenze , italy , 2 - 7 june 2013 . some new remarkable experimental results released since then have been implemented here . </S>"
