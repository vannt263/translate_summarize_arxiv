    "weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for mapping the distribution of dark matter since it measures the matter distribution directly without the need to make assumptions about the way that light traces mass .",
    "most approaches focus on shear , which is the first - order distortion of the background galaxy images caused by the bending of light from large scale structure ( lss ) .",

    "this second - order in image distortions corresponding to a third - order effect in gravitational potential @xcite is responsible for the weakly skewed and arc - like appearance of lensed galaxies and is expected to probe variations of the gravitational potential field on smaller scales than those accessible by shear analysis alone . despite the fact that measurement of the octopole moments is more complex , their intrinsic dispersion due to the random shapes of galaxies is expected to be much smaller than the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion . in @xcite ,",
    "the method has been further developed by using the shapelet formalism to estimate second - order lensing effect . at the same time , a related approach using the galaxy sextupole moments has also been explored @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors suggest a new method called holics to measure the second - order lensing effect based on the measurement of the octopole and higer - order moments . in @xcite , the second - order lensing effect was detected for the first time and the term  flexion \" has been adopted to describe it .",
