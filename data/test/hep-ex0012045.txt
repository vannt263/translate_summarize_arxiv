    "all particle species , including neutrinos , must have been produced during the big bang . should neutrinos be stable and sufficiently massive",
    ", their combined gravitational attraction would be sufficient to collapse the universe .",
    "our existence therefore allows one to infer properties of invisible but gravitationally interacting matter .",
    "this argument was originally advanced by gershtein and zeldovich@xcite in 1966 and was used by cowsik and mcclelland@xcite to devise a limit on the order of @xmath0 for the sum of the masses of stable neutrino species , where h is the scaled hubble constant . this argument",
    "also supplies a lower bound on extremely heavy neutrinos at the gev scale .",
    "details of these limits can change substantially if neutrinos decay .",
    "the change depends on the equation of state of its decay products - a massive neutrino decaying to massless particles will effect the evolution of the universe differently than one with massive decay products .",
    "the effect also depends on the time scale of the neutrino decay relative to other time scales in the universe , such as that of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the contribution of decaying neutrinos to supernovae energetics can also be used to derive limits on @xmath1 lifetime and mass @xcite .    shown in figure",
    "[ fig : cosmo ] are a set of allowed and excluded regions of mass and lifetime , as supplied by aleph @xcite .",
    "in addition to these cosmological bounds , the figure also shows the limits imposed by the lack of observation of neutrino - less decays such as @xmath2 - these decays could have massive neutrinos inside of loops and would therefore be sensitive to neutrino properties . in addition , the stringent limit claimed by aleph@xcite is also plotted in the figure .",
    "note that on such a scale , the difference in mass limits from different experiments would be barely visible .",
    "of interest is that at the mev mass scale , where accelerators are currently sensitive , many lines cross - this indicates that this could be a region rich with ( mis)understanding , where many different approximations might break down",
    ".    it would be interesting to review what effect recent indications of a non - zero cosmological constant might have on all these limits .",
    "the overlap of the supernova and boomerang data released this year indicate that the gravitational energy density of the universe is to within a factor of a few equal to that used to derive the cowsik - mcclelland limit and that the ensuing argument is still qualitatively valid .",
    "one can also recast the argument in terms of the stability of clusters , and this still yields a comparable limit @xcite .",
    "the donut collaboration has recently announced that it has made the first observation of tau neutrino appearance .",
    "although their results ( reported elsewhere in these proceedings ) do not tell us very much about the mass of this neutrino , they do tell us that it does exist .    the karmen collaboration , which had previously reported an anomaly consistent with a weakly interacting neutral particle emitted in pion decays with a mass of 33.9 mev @xcite , no longer sees this anomaly in a larger dataset .",
    "their new results are reported elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "possibly the most talked about recent results are those coming from the superkamiokande collaboration , also reported elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "they report that their data is consistent with the mixing of muon type neutrinos into a different state , most probably @xmath3 neutrinos .",
    "should these results hold up , they are a strong argument against a massive neutrino in the allowed mev mass range .",
    "unfortunately , superkamiokande has yet to take into account the possibility that neutrinos are massive and can decay .",
    "given that all other known particles that oscillate also decay , one might legitimately ask whether this is also the case in the neutrino sector .",
    "one could hope that low mass , long lived electron type neutrinos , medium lived muon neutrinos and short lived massive tau neutrinos might help explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles . until such possibilities are ruled out it might be premature to assume that mixing has been proven and that the mev mass scale for the tau neutrino is no longer interesting .",
    "simply showing consistency with a given model does not necessarily rule out other models .",
    "at electron - positron colliders , it is possible to produce mono - energetic tau pairs . when these decay to hadrons and exactly one neutrino each , the tau flight direction on each side must have been along a cone around the direction of the hadronic decay products .",
    "the size of this cone depends on the tau and neutrino mass .",
    "requiring that the common @xmath3 flight direction is on the overlap of the two cones allows one to measure @xmath4 .",
    "this method was used by cleo@xcite , resulting in the mass distribution shown in figure  [ fig : twocone ] .    the sharp drop near 1.8",
    "gev provides the required mass . combining this result with the bes result for the @xmath3 mass@xcite",
    ", cleo derives an upper limit of 60 mev on the neutrino mass at 95% c.l .",
    "if the tau neutrino were more massive than the tau , the tau could not decay : the mass of the neutrino restricts the allowed phase space and decay rate .",
    "one can set a limit on the neutrino mass by carefully measuring branching ratios of the tau .",
    "the theoretically best predicted decays are the fully leptonic decays @xmath5 where @xmath6 , with the main uncertainties coming from the tau mass and lifetime .",
    "these are measured at the per cent level .",
    "knowing the pion and kaon form factors , once can also use the single body hadronic decays of the tau . using the particle data group best fit values for all these parameters , swain and taylor@xcite derives a 95 % confidence level upper limit on the tau neutrino mass at 68 mev .",
    "the method that has given the most stringent limits on the tau neutrino mass attempts to fit the two dimensional spectrum of hadronic decay product mass and energy for @xmath3 s produced at electron - positron colliders .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : evsm ] , near the endpoint , the kinematically allowed contour depends very strongly on the neutrino mass . not only",
    "does the contour depend on the neutrino mass , but for any fixed energy , the hadronic mass spectrum shape also depends on the neutrino mass : points away from the limit contain some information on the neutrino mass .",
    "however , for a fixed hadronic mass , the derivative of the hadronic energy with respect to the neutrino mass is effectively flat except for a delta function at the contour limit .",
    "finite smearing dilutes further the neutrino mass sensitivity , as do initial and final state radiation .",
    "note that isr / fsr cause points to drop along the energy axis in the figure , but do not smear them along the mass direction .",
    "these effects are calculable however .",
    "one can distinguish two different types of decays used for this kind of analysis with different sensitivities to systematic errors .",
    "decays to many pions ( e.g. @xmath7 ) tend to produce events near the sensitive endpoint but suffer from small branching ratios and low reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "decays with few particles in the final state ( e.g. @xmath8 ) tend to produce events far away from the endpoint , but have efficiencies and branching ratios that are large - one hopes that the efficiencies are large enough that a rare event near the endpoint will be reconstructed .",
    "the most general likelihood function is of the form : @xmath9 the first term , used only by @xcite and @xcite , is a poisson term relating the number of events near the endpoint as a function of the number of events far from the endpoint and the neutrino mass .",
    "one uses this term as a compromise to avoid fitting over many points which do not have much neutrino mass information , and also lessen the dependence on the explicit form of the physics function in the low mass region .",
    "the product term is taken over all accepted data events , and is composed of a signal term @xmath10 and a background term @xmath11 .",
    "the signal term is composed of a convolution of the expected detector smearing , efficiency and the differential decay width .",
    "the neutrino mass enters only through the decay width and the limits of integration for the convolution - again , the energy dependence on neutrino mass in this term comes in only as an integration limit , and not a slope .",
    "the differential decay width depends on the v - a nature of the weak interaction , the underlying physics of the event and the radiative corrections , including isr and fsr .",
    "the background term is a parameterization of events which are not signal , whether originating from ( mis - reconstructed ) tau decays or other physics .",
    "these terms in general do not depend on the neutrino mass - this is true to a high degree even for the mis - reconstructed @xmath3 events since they tend to be highly smeared over the plot .",
    "this lack of dependence on neutrino mass makes this type of likelihood divergent when all neutrino masses are considered so one introduces a prior distribution , cutting off neutrino masses greater than say 100 mev . the background shape is generally determined either from monte carlo or directly from non - tau decay data .",
    "the relative weight of signal and background , @xmath12 , is usually determined by fitting for the number of events above the endpoint region .",
    "the likelihood is then used to determine an upper limit on the mass of the neutrino .",
    "this is generally done by integrating the likelihood to a 95th percentile above 0 mev or by finding where the log of the likelihood drops by 1.92 from its peak .",
    "neither method is more correct than the other , rather each expresses a different philosophy on the meaning of the upper limit . in all cases published so far",
    "the application of either method gives a consistent answer to within @xmath13 .",
    "since only one new result has been published since the last conference , readers desiring a full review of previous results should refer to r. mcnulty s review in the previous set of proceedings @xcite .",
    "these results are briefly summarized in table  [ table : summary ] .",
    "the new result is from cleo@xcite which has examined the neutrino mass using the decay @xmath14 for the first time .",
    "this sample is composed of 29,000 decay events , as shown in figure  [ fig:4pimasscleo2000 ] .",
    "the fit includes an explicit term accounting function for mis - identified tau decays , corresponding to 7% of the event sample .",
    "some 3% of the sample is accounted for by a non - tau background term .",
    "the spectral function in this decay was fit below the neutrino mass sensitive region to a combination of non - resonant , rho and omega subcomponents .",
    "this fit was then extended into the endpoint region .",
    "the resulting likelihood distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : likelicleo2000 ] .",
    "the 95th percentile above 0 mev is at 22 mev for the raw data , and the total systematic error , added in linearly to conform with the standard set by previous studies , sets the final limit at 28 mev .",
    "the main systematic error comes in through the spectral function dependence , the @xmath15 energy scale , as well as the charged track momentum reconstruction .",
    "a glance at table  [ table : summary ] summarizing all published results shows that all limits are generally within the same range , in spite of a very large range of event sample sizes .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + the values here are calculated using the cleo monte carlo and detector simulation for @xmath16 decays .",
    "exact values will vary from experiment to experiment , and decay mode to decay mode .",
    "in light of the observations made above , i would like to counsel future limit setters to heed the following advice :    * restrict your fit region and use a poisson term : since most events far from the endpoint have little neutrino mass information apart from helping to normalize the expected number of events near the endpoint , it is not worth cpu time to fit these events in detail . *",
    "use a background function : if one wishes to avoid using a background function , one must use tighter and tighter cuts as the accepted luminosity increases .",
    "this can result in the paradoxical situation in which an experiment ends up with less sensitivity as its sample size grows .",
    "the inclusion of a background function remedies this strange state of affairs . *",
    "publish the expected reach @xmath17 ( and its variance ) for a massless neutrino hypothesis .",
    "this will help establish whether the limit from data is meaningful or a dangerous fluctuation .",
    "* publish the discriminatory power of your experiment : how often does your data derived limit occur for a large ( say 50 mev ) neutrino mass ? * compare the limit derived from mass information only to the limit derived from the energy vs mass distribution : if the two dimensional limit is substantially different from the one dimensional one , then the limit is being driven by a small number of events or a very unlikely event distribution . * carefully examine large smearing tails : comments given in the text point out that the sharp cut - off in reconstructed energy as determined by the neutrino mass make the properties of the neutrino mass estimator unclear . at the very least , one should carefully examine the effects of systematic error along the energy axis .",
    "ultimately , as samples grow and the relevant fit region shrinks , fluctuations due to the unknown tails of the smearing functions in both mass and energy must dominate the fits .",
    "in light of the suspicious properties of the maximum likelihood estimator raised in this review , it would be very useful if experimenters would calibrate their estimators using a monte carlo method .",
    "the method proposed herein answers the question of `` what masses are ruled out by my data ? ''    * generate a large number of monte carlo samples with sizes comparable to those obtained in data for different input neutrino masses ( @xmath18 ) * for each of these samples , form the likelihood , and find the neutrino mass which maximizes the likelihood , @xmath19 * plot @xmath19 vs @xmath18 * form the likelihood for the data sample and find its maximum @xmath20 * find @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is larger than @xmath20 @xmath21 of the time * set the upper limit to this value    unfortunately this method does not provide a nice way to combine limits from different experiments .",
    "however given the points made in this review , perhaps it is better to suffer from this than to combine likelihoods with unclear statistical properties , and possibly incompatible meanings .",
    "i have briefly reviewed the current constraints on an mev scale tau neutrino mass .",
    "these constraints are from astrophysical observations as well as from terrestrial observations and all of them taken at face value allow for the existence of an unstable @xmath1 with a mass on an mev scale .",
    "recent superkamiokande results indicate that the ( stable ) neutrinos participating in atmospheric @xmath22 disappearance have a mass well below an mev and are consistent with stable tau neutrinos .",
    "an inspection of the two dimensional limits on the @xmath3 neutrino mass derived from experimental data reveal that the ensemble of limits is too consistent .",
    "i have also for the first time shown that the usual assumption that the likelihood is well behaved for this technique is questionable .",
    "i have ended by recommending what extra information future limit setters should publish to allow others to gauge the believability of their limits , and have also recommended a method more suited to obtaining an answer to the question of what neutrino mass is excluded by the observed data than the methods used up to now .",
    "the audience would have found this talk far more tedious had it not been for many interesting discussions with ronan mcnulty and many other colleagues at cern and on cleo .",
    "i d like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to give this talk in such a nice location .",
    "i also would like to thank the national science foundation for its support .    9 s.s .",
