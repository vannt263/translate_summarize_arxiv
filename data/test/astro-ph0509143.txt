    "* assuming here and hence forth @xmath7 = 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) , the largest number discovered so far in a single galaxy @xcite .",
    "one x - ray source in the antennae that has received considerable attention in the recent literature is x-37 , as designated by @xcite . at the distance to these interacting galaxies ( 19.3 mpc )",
    "it would have an x - ray luminosity , @xmath8 = 4.5@xmath9@xmath10ergs s@xmath6 , making it a ulx .",
    "a previous attempt to match x - ray positions directly to _ hst _ positions indicated that this object has a significant ( @xmath11 ) offset from a nearby optical source @xcite .",
    "this spawned discussions of whether this is a runaway x - ray binary escaping from its parent cluster @xcite .",
    "but , matching x - ray positions directly to the optical is difficult due to the crowded _ hst _ field and image rotation .    in @xcite (",
    "henceforth paper 1 ) we demonstrated that the infrared ( ir ) is a powerful method for finding counterparts to x - ray sources .",
    "this wavelength regime has similar dust penetrating properties to x - rays , facilitating counterpart identification . in a subsequent paper",
    "we match x - ray and optical _ hst _ positions with high precision by using the ir frame tie as a go - between ( clark , et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ; henceforth paper 2 ) .",
    "here we use x-37 to demonstrate the success of our method and show the importance of obtaining follow - up spectra of counterparts to ulx candidates .",

    "our analysis of the counterpart to x-37 is based in part on ir @xmath12 ( 1.25 @xmath13 m ) and @xmath4 ( 2.15 @xmath13 m ) band images of the antennae .",

    "the rms positional uncertainty is @xmath15 .    with the astrometric frame tie in place",
    ", we identified a bright , @xmath4 = 16.2 mag source @xmath0 from the x - ray position of x-37 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "note that this contradicts previous reports of a significant offset between x-37 and the star cluster candidate , and independently eliminates any need for the hypothesis that this x - ray source is a runaway x - ray binary ( zezas & fabbiano 2002 ; see also miller et al .",
    "2004a ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we also base this study on work done in paper 2 where we studied optical counterparts to x - ray sources in the antennae .",

    ", we found an optical source @xmath18 from the x - ray position of x-37 ( figure 1 )  again , an insignificant offset .",
    "we acquired an optical spectrum of x-37 on march 7 , 2003 , using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lris ) on keck i. we observed this source in two separate slitmasks with a 400 lines mm@xmath6 grating and blaze wavelength of 8500  , yielding a total wavelength coverage on the red side of 5600 - 9400  .",
    "seeing throughout the observations was @xmath19 .",
    "we observed x-37 for a total of 6000 seconds between the two masks with typical single exposure times of 600 seconds .",
    "we reduced the spectrum with a combination of standard iraf procedures and idl code using the near arc - lamp spectrum for wavelength calibration .",
    "we used the standard star feige 67 to flux calibrate the spectrum .",
    "we extracted spectra of the x-37 counterpart from each individual exposure in a @xmath20 ( approximately 2 fwhm ) region centered on the emission peak . a background spectrum extracted from a region",
    "@xmath21 removed from the counterpart was sufficient for removing the night sky lines .",
    "we point out the blended lines , h@xmath1/[nii ] at @xmath22 @xmath23 and the [ sii ] pair at @xmath24  , observed at the redshift of the antennae ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these spectral features are at approximately the same levels in the on - source and background spectra , suggesting that they are likely diffuse emission from the antennae and not associated with x-37 .",
    "noting the broad emission lines characteristic of a quasar we looked for other spectral features to confirm this classification .",
    "the realization that the broad line at 8296 @xmath23 was red - shifted h@xmath1 prompted a search for additional lines generally associated with quasars .",
    "we noted a plethora of such identifiers including the non - restframe wavelengths of h@xmath25 at 6148  , [ oi ] at 7965  , [ nii ] at 8320  , and [ sii ] at 8510  .",
    "this corroborated our conclusion that x-37 is a quasar .    using",
    "the observed , narrow [ oiii ] lines at 6270.45 @xmath23 and 6330.94  , we measured a redshift of z=0.26 . at the redshift to this quasar , x-37 would now have an x - ray luminosity of @xmath26 ergs s@xmath6 . as we show in table 1 , this luminosity is typical of the x - ray luminosity for quasars at a similar distance @xcite .      to investigate how much of the continuum flux could be due to the quasar , we compared the photometric properties of this source to that of other quasars at x-37 s redshift of z=0.26 .",
    "we chose @xmath2 and @xmath3-band photometry from the _ hst _ images and @xmath4-band photometry from the wirc images .",
    "this choice in filters covers the full wavelength range used in our studies of the antennae ( clark , et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . defining the photometric aperture as @xmath30 of the gaussian point spread function ( psf ) width , the aperture radii are 3-pixels in @xmath2 , 2.5-pixels in @xmath3 , and 5-pixels in @xmath4 .",
    "subtracting sky background flux is especially difficult in the antennae considering the bright , crowded background in these galaxies . to compensate for this difficulty",
    ", we chose to measure the mean and median sky background flux in two separate annuli between @xmath31 of the psf .",
    "being an isolated source , we did not have to compensate for crowded conditions in the field around the x-37 counterpart .",
    "multiplying the mean and median sky background by the area of the central aperture and then subtracting this from the central aperture yielded four separate flux measurements for the source .",
    "we then averaged these four values to give us the source flux . when computing errors , we considered variations in the sky background , @xmath32 , and poison noise , @xmath33 . to calculate @xmath32",
    "we found the standard deviation of the four flux values for each source . dividing the mean source flux by the instruments gain and then taking the square root of these , we found @xmath33 .",
    "the known gain for wirc is 2 e@xmath6/dn @xcite , while @xcite use a gain of 7 e@xmath6/dn for _ hst_. both @xmath32 and @xmath33 were added in quadrature to yield a total error in flux , @xmath34 .",
    "we used a bright , 2mass star to convert @xmath4 flux into a magnitude .",
    "we derived _",
    "hst _ magnitudes using zero points listed in table 28.1 of the _ hst _ data handbook @xcite . applying color transformations defined in @xcite , we converted _ hst _ magnitudes to johnson @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we expressed errors in magnitude , @xmath35 , as @xmath34 divided by the mean flux . in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath35 consists of the additional errors in the zeropoint and color transformations , all of which were added in quadrature .",
    "we next converted these photometric measurements to reddening - corrected absolute magnitudes . at the redshift of x-37 ,",
    "the distance modulus is 40.1 mag .",
    "we derived reddening in @xmath3 , @xmath36 = 1.3 mag , using the x - ray derived column density , @xmath37 , listed in table 5 of @xcite and the relationship",
    "@xmath36 = @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath37 .",
    "we used the @xmath37 value provided by the power - law spectral fits of @xcite .",
    "these authors computed @xmath37 assuming the absorption is at zero redshift .",
    "this should not be a problem for us since the broad absorption lines observed in the x-37 spectrum suggest there is little extinction along the line of sight to it .",
    "to find reddening in other filters , we used the extinction law defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "we also computed separate reddenings in each filter using the rieke - lebofsky ( rl ) law @xcite .",
    "we then expressed errors in reddening , @xmath40 , as the difference in @xmath41 , @xmath36 and @xmath42 derived from each law . adding @xmath40 and @xmath35 in quadrature , we computed a total error in absolute magnitude .    in table 1",
    ", we compare the absolute magnitudes , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , of the x-37 counterpart to typical magnitudes for quasars at a similar distance .",
    "we obtained @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalog @xcite for 33 quasars at a redshift of 0.26 .",
    "using color transformations listed in @xcite , we converted sdss magnitudes to the johnson photometric system .",
    "we used the catalog described in @xcite to derive @xmath45 for 17 quasars at a redshift of 0.26 . considering the absolute magnitude of x-37 in the @xmath2",
    ", @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands falls within the range of catalog quasar magnitudes , x-37 has the luminosity of a typical quasar .",
    "the identification of x-37 with a background quasar further demonstrates the importance of spectroscopic followup for the study of ulx sources . while the overabundance of such sources near galaxies clearly demonstrates that a physical connection does exist for many ulx sources as a population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the strong possibility of background quasar contamination makes such identification for any particular source perilous ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a specific example involving x-37 is the recent work of @xcite . in their figure 2 , @xcite compare the black hole mass to inner disk temperature for both ulx sources and  standard \" stellar - mass black holes , finding that the ulx sources have cooler disk temperatures .",
    "they use this to conclude that ulx are likely to be powered by accretion onto intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh ) . while some of the sources in this diagram are almost certainly ulxs ( i.e. ngc 1313 x-1 and ngc 1313 x-2 ) , and thus possible imbh , it is somewhat surprising to note that the  ulx \" x-37 is grouped with these sources in the diagram  despite the fact that its actual black hole mass is at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than assumed by @xcite .",
    "thus , x-37 illustrates the importance of follow - up spectroscopic confirmation of ulxs , and sounds a cautionary note regarding conclusions based on observations without such confirmation .",
    "the authors are especially grateful to fred hamann and vicki sarajedini for examining our spectra and helping identify this unusual source as a quasar .",
    "we also thank j. houck for his support of the wirc instrument project .",
