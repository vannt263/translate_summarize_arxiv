    "the investigation of the general properties of black holes has attracted considerable interest .",
    "it is well known that when perturbing a black hole , it undergoes oscillations which are characterized by some complex eigenvalues , with negative imaginary parts , of the wave equations called quasinormal frequencies .",
    "their real parts represent the oscillation frequencies , while the imaginary ones determine the damping rates of modes .",
    "qnms of black holes have been an intriguing subject of discussion for the last few decades(@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "hawking radiation from black holes is one of the most striking effects that is known , or at least widely agreed to arise from combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "as one of the most important achievements of quantum field theory in curved spacetime , the discovery of hawking radiation supported these ideas availably which showed that a classical black hole could radiate thermal spectrum of particles . hawking and ellis(@xcite )",
    "evoke the possible origin of radiation to be a black body radiation left over from a hot early stage of the universe , the result of superposition of a very large number of very distant unsolved discrete sources or intergalactic grains which thermalize other forms of radiations .",
    "the hawking radiation for the reissner - nordstrm black hole is widely studied in literature(@xcite ) .",
    "there has been growing observational evidence showing that our universe is accelerated expanding driven by a yet unknown dark energy .",
    "recent results from the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) combined with supernova of type ia , large - scale structure ( cosmic shear ) and galaxy cluster abundances show that our universe is dominated by a mysterious dark energy with negative pressure(@xmath0 ) and contains cold dark matter with negligible pressure(@xmath1 ) , the ordinary baryonic matter makes up @xmath2(@xcite ) .",
    "dark energy can be studied by its influence on the expansion of the universe as well as on the growth of the large scale structure .",
    "cosmological models with a dark energy fluid with an equation of state parameter @xmath3 close to @xmath4 are favored by combining recent cmb , supernova and baryon acoustic oscillations data , suggesting that the hubble expansion accelerates in the current cosmic epoch .",
    "there are several types of models of dark energy such as the cosmological constant(@xcite ) , quintessence(@xcite ) , phantom(@xcite ) , k - essence(@xcite ) , and quintom(@xcite ) models . for quintessence , the equation of state parameter is in the range of @xmath5 .",
