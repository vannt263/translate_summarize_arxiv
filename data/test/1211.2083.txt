    "the concept of quantum entanglement plays a key role in the field of quantum information manipulation and processing@xcite .",
    "it describes the inseparability between parts of a given system in a given state . in the past decade , the close relation between quantum entanglement and the quantum correlation in many - body systems are discussed@xcite , especially in the context of condensed matter physics@xcite , cold atoms@xcite , and quantum chemistry@xcite , etc .",
    "one of the most interesting ideas is to employ the entanglement entropy as an indicator of quantum phase transition ( qpt)@xcite in both spin systems@xcite and the interacting fermion systems@xcite . for those quantum phase transitions that can not be described by landau s symmetry breaking paradigm",
    ", there is no well defined local order parameters . in such cases ,",
    "the entanglement entropy may be a really useful concept for characterizing the quantum phase .",
    "one of such qpt is the mott metal - insulator transition , where a many - body system transits from a metallic state into an insulator , when the interaction strength between particles exceeds a critical value@xcite .",
    "experimentally , mott transition ( mt ) has been widely studied both in strongly correlated electron systems such as @xmath5@xcite and in cold atom systems@xcite . in the most strict sense of the mott transition ,",
    "no symmetry breaking occurs at the transition and hence it belongs to the type outside the landau s paradigm . since 1960",
    "s , mott transition has been one of the key issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "theoretically , intensive studies based on the hubbard - type models have been done in the past decades@xcite . the study of mt in terms of the quantum entanglement , especially using the entanglement entropy as a measure , appears for one - dimensional@xcite , two - dimensional@xcite , and infinite dimensional@xcite hubbard - like models .    for fermionic lattice models",
    ", a connection has been established rigorously between the singularity of single - site entanglement entropy @xmath0 and the order of qpt , under certain conditions@xcite .",
    "this connection states that the discontinuity in the ( k - 1)-th order derivative of s gives a k - th order qpt .",
    "for one dimensional hubbard model , @xmath0 reaches a maximum at @xmath6 where mt occurs@xcite , due to equal population of all the local bases at the transition point@xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "study on finite size system does not disclose any singularity at @xmath3@xcite . in this paper , we focus on the single - site entanglement entropy @xmath0 near the mt in the fermionic hubbard model in infinite spatial dimensions . in this limit",
    ", the spatial fluctuations of electrons are suppressed while the local quantum fluctuation remains .",
    "the hubbard model can be solved exactly in this limit using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite .",
    "recently , dmft is used to evaluate the relative entropy@xcite as a measure of correlation for the hubbard model as well as for a series of transition metal oxides@xcite .",
    "for the half - filled hubbard model , at low temperature , the fermi - liquid state in small @xmath7 regime is separated from the mott insulator state in large @xmath7 regime by a special second - order qpt@xcite .",
    "although this mott transition in large spatial dimensions has received considerable attention in the past years , no analysis has been carried out for the critical behavior of its entanglement properties .",
    "we expect that such analysis can help to deepen our understanding of the mt in general .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section @xmath8",
    ", we introduce the single - site entanglement entropy @xmath0 and the method that we used to evaluate it for the hubbard model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the dmft with exact diagonalization and the two - site dmft . in section",
    "@xmath9 , we present numerical as well as analytical results for @xmath0 near the mt . in section",
    "@xmath10 we end with a brief summary .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model reads @xmath11 @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the hopping matrix element and @xmath7 is the on - site repulsion of electrons with opposite spin . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are annihilation and creation operators of the electron on site @xmath16 with spin @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the chemical potential .",
    "to study the local entanglement entropy , we divide the whole lattice into two parts , subsystem ( a ) ( a single site @xmath16 ) and the environment ( b ) ( the rest part of the lattice ) . for a given quantum state @xmath19 of the whole system ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of the subsystem is @xmath20 the bipartite entanglement entropy between the subsystem and the environment is defined as ( setting @xmath21 ) @xmath22 from eq.(2 ) , one gets @xmath23 for any given operator @xmath24 of the system . taking @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for site @xmath16 ,",
    "one gets 4 equations about the diagonal elements of @xmath29 under the basis set @xmath30 . here",
    "we study the symmetry unbroken ground state of hubbard model @xmath31 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are all zero due to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 symmetries of hubbard model , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath35 the averages are with respect to the ground state of hubbard model , and translation invariance is assumed here . for a half - filled lattice in the paramagnetic phase where the mott transition occurs , one has @xmath36 .",
    "the entanglement entropy thus reads  @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the expectation value of the double occupancy . for the the ground state of the hubbard model in infinite spatial dimensions",
    ", this quantity can be readily evaluated from the converged self - consistent solution of dmft .",
    "the dmft is a well - developed theory for treating the hubbard - type strongly correlated models@xcite . in dmft",
    ", the hubbard model is first mapped into an effective anderson impurity model , @xmath39 + u c_{\\uparrow}^{\\dagger } c_{\\uparrow } c_{\\downarrow}^{\\dagger }     c_{\\downarrow } -\\mu \\sum_{\\sigma}c_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger } c_{\\sigma}.\\ ] ] here @xmath40 is the annihilation operator of bath site @xmath41 , and the the parameters of the electron bath @xmath42 determine the dynamical `` weiss field '' @xmath43 the impurity model is then solved to generate the impurity green s function @xmath44 on the matsubara frequency axis . finally , through the self - consistent equation @xmath45 together with @xmath46 , a new `` weiss field '' @xmath47 can be obtained and used to update the bath parameters @xmath48 .",
    "this process iterates and the converged solution of the impurity self - energy will be taken as the local self - energy of the lattice model , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "we adopt the semi - circular density of states @xmath50 @xmath51 is set as the energy unit .",
    "eq.(9 ) is the density of states of free electrons on the bethe lattice with infinite coordination number .",
    "it is widely used in the study of the mt because it simplifies the self - consistent equation while keeps the qualitative physics intact .",
    "we first solve dmft equations using the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method of caferral _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "then , we resort to the two - site dmft@xcite for analytical results . at half filling , this theory is reduced to the linearized dmft@xcite .",
    "it is shown that it can produce rather accurate @xmath3 as well as physical quantities near the critical point .    in the following , we present our results for @xmath52 and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath7 , both from dmft with ed and from the analytical two - site dmft formulism .",
    "it has been known@xcite that for finite temperatures @xmath53 , the metallic state for small @xmath7 is separated from the insulating - like state for large @xmath7 by a finite regime @xmath54 , in which the metal and the insulator phases coexist .",
    "the true first order phase transition occurs at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) where the free energies of the metallic and of the insulating solutions coincide . at zero temperature , @xmath57@xcite and @xmath58@xcite .",
    "the mott transition becomes a special second - order phase transition at @xmath59 : @xmath60 is continuous but the meta - stable solution of insulator extends from large u regime into the regime @xmath61 .    in fig.1",
    ", we show the double occupancy @xmath52 and entanglement entropy @xmath0 as functions of @xmath7 , obtained from dmft with ed for a very low temperature @xmath62 , which is practically same as zero temperature . as shown in fig.1(a ) , the double occupancy @xmath52 decreases linearly as @xmath7 increases up to the critical point @xmath63 . near @xmath63 ,",
    "coexistence of two solutions and hysteresis in @xmath7-scanning are observed . from the solution of @xmath52 obtained by scanning from small @xmath7 to large @xmath7 ( solid circles in fig.1(a ) ) , we can identify a linear form in the @xmath64 regime after a non - singular term @xmath2 is subtracted , @xmath65 the other solution of @xmath52 ( empty squares in fig.1(a ) ) is obtained by scanning from large @xmath7 to small @xmath7 .",
    "it extends to @xmath66 and recovers the first solution through a finite jump . from the continuation of @xmath52 at @xmath63 in the second solution",
    ", we can infer that in the @xmath67 regime , a linear behavior with a much smaller slope must hold .",
    "therefore , we can summarize @xmath68 as @xmath69 with @xmath4 and having different values on two sides of the phase transition .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario of the special second - order mt@xcite in infinite dimensions : @xmath70 is discontinuous .",
    "our ed calculation gives @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in agreement with previous results of ed and projected self - consistent technique  @xcite .",
    "there is a small but finite double occupancy @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "this reflects that even at critical point and in the insulating state , there is residual local charge fluctuations .",
    "this has important consequence for the entanglement entropy in the insulating state .",
    "see below .    in fig.1(b ) , the entanglement entropy @xmath0 is shown . at @xmath75",
    ", @xmath76 comes from the equal population of electrons on the four local states .",
    "@xmath0 decreases monotonously with @xmath7 . after a inflection point at @xmath74",
    ", it continues to decrease towards its strong - coupling limit @xmath77 , which comes from the spin two - fold degeneracy in the paramagnetic insulator phase .",
    "being consistent with @xmath52 , two solutions coexist in the regime @xmath78 and a hysteresis is observed .",
    "what is interesting is the nonzero critical value of the entanglement entropy @xmath79 .",
    "this reflects the residual entanglement between a single site and the others at the critical point and in the insulating phase .",
    "the critical behavior of @xmath0 may be easily obtained from eq.(8 ) and ( 5 ) : @xmath80 here @xmath4 and it has different values on two sides of mt . due to the finite @xmath81",
    ", @xmath0 is not singular at @xmath74 but its derivative is discontinuous .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "here is the big difference between the static mean - field theory and the dmft .",
    "for static mean - field theories such as the weiss mean - field theory , the entanglement will become zero as soon as the system enters the long - range ordered phase , while it stays as a constant @xmath82 in the paramagnetic phase , arising from spin two - fold degeneracy .",
    "for dmft , although the short range spin - correlation is not taken into account , the local temporal fluctuations do generate entanglement between one site and the others .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for the hubbard model , the local charge fluctuations in the insulating phase is associated with a nonzero local entanglement between one site and the others .    here",
    "we did not quest for the highest precision in our ed calculation . near @xmath63 ,",
    "the critical slowing down in solving dmft equations prevents ed from obtaining rigorous conclusion . to get a more explicit solution , we resort to the two - site dmft , which can give analytical results in the critical regime .      in the two - site dmft",

    "@xmath85 is to be fixed by the second equation of eq.(14 ) .",
    "eq.(13 ) and ( 14 ) can be solved numerically .",

    "@xmath89 is obtained from the weight of the quasiparticle poles of the impurity green s function .",

    ", we first solve the retarded green s function of the impurity model at zero temperature ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 .\\ ] ] for the particle - hole symmetric case , the eigen values and eigen states of @xmath94 can be solved analytically .",
    "the green s function has four poles .",
    "two of them near @xmath97 are for hubbard bands , and the other two poles near @xmath98 are precursors of the coherent kondo resonance . to calculate @xmath89 , we take the weights of the latter two poles and expand @xmath89 in terms of powers of @xmath99 , @xmath100 this expression together with eq.(14 ) gives the solution for @xmath85 as @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 . here",

    "the system is in the insulating phase .",
    "note that this expression differs from that of potthoff@xcite in the prefactor , due to different ways of calculating @xmath89@xcite .",
    "exact solution of @xmath94 gives the analytical expression for the double occupancy as @xmath109 combining it with eq.(17 ) , one obtains the critical expression for @xmath52 as , @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath0 we have @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath103 .",
    "however , it is noted that @xmath114 in eq.(20 ) is not the correct results .",
    "although the two - site dmft equation requires @xmath115 , the double occupancy @xmath116 does not equal to its lattice counterpart @xmath117 , due to the fact that the two - site dmft is an approximation to the full dmft . in fig.2(a ) , we plot @xmath116 and @xmath117 as functions of @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath117 is calculated using the lattice green s function@xcite .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath107 , both @xmath116 and @xmath117 are linear near @xmath3 . for @xmath103 , although @xmath118 , @xmath117 is small but finite , with a finite slope at @xmath119 , consistent with ed results .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath114 calculated from @xmath116 becomes @xmath120 immediately after @xmath121 , while @xmath122 calculated from @xmath117 is not singular at @xmath123 .",
    "it has a linear behavior at @xmath3 but with a much smaller slope than that on the @xmath124 side .",
    "this agrees with the ed results .",
    "therefore , we believe that the @xmath122 is an improvement over @xmath114 which ignores the finite @xmath52 at @xmath3 .",
