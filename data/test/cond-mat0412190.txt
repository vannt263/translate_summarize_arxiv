    "since the discovery that quantum algorithms can solve certain computational problems much more efficiently than classical ones,@xcite attention has been devoted to the physical implementation of quantum computation . among the many proposals , there are those based on the electron spin@xcite or charge@xcite in laterally confined quantum dots , which may have great potential for scalability and integration within current technologies .",
    "single qubit operations involving the spin of an electron in a quantum dot will likely require precise engineering of the underlying material or control over local magnetic fields;@xcite both have yet to be achieved in practice .",
    "in contrast , single qubit operations involving charge in a double quantum dot ( dqd ) @xcite are already within experimental reach.@xcite they can be performed either by sending electrical pulses to modulate the potential barrier between the dots ( tunnel pulsing)@xcite or by changing the relative position of the energy levels ( bias pulsing).@xcite in both cases one acts on the overlap between the electronic wave functions of the dots .",
    "this permits direct control over the two low - energy charge states of the system  the basis states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a qubit : calling @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) the number of excess electrons in the left ( right ) dot , we have that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .     denotes the number of excess electrons in the dots for given values of the gate voltages @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "[ fig : diamonds ] ) . along this line",
    ", an electron can move between the dots with no charging energy cost .",
    "an advantage of this system is that the hilbert space is two - dimensional , even at moderate temperatures , since single - particle excitations do not alter the charge configuration .",
    "leakage from the computational space involves energies of order the charging energy which is quite large in practice ( @xmath11  mev @xmath12  k ) . in the case of tunnel",
    "pulsing , working adiabatically  such that the inverse of the switching time is much less than the charging energy  assures minimal leakage .",
    "the large charging energy implies that pulses as short as tens to hundreds of picoseconds would be well within the adiabatic regime .",
    "however , the drawback of using charge to build qubits is the high decoherence rates when compared to spin .",
    "since for any successful qubit one must be able to perform single- and double - qubit operations much faster than the decoherence time , a quantitative understanding of decoherence mechanisms in a dqd is essential .    in this work ,",
    "we carry out an analysis of phonon decoherence in a dqd charge qubit . during qubit operations ,",
    "the electron charge movement induces phonon creation and annihilation , thus leading to energy relaxation and decoherence . in order to quantify these effects ,",
    "we follow the time dependence of the system s reduced density matrix , after tracing out the phonon bath , using the redfield formalism in the born and markov approximations.@xcite    our results show that decoherence rates for this situation are one to two orders of magnitude weaker than previously estimated .",
    "the discrepancy arises mainly due to the use of different spectral functions .",
    "our model incorporates realistic geometric features which were lacking in previous calculations . when compared to recent experimental results ,",
    "our calculations indicate that phonons are likely not the main source of decoherence in current dqd setups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model used to describe the dqd , discuss the coupling to phonons , and establish the markov formulation used to solve for the reduced density matrix . in sec .",

    "[ sec : bias ] we simulate the bias pulsing experiment of ref .  .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we begin by assuming that the dqd is isolated from the leads .",
    "the dqd and the phonon bath combined can then be described by the total hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are individual dqd and phonon hamiltonians , respectively , and @xmath16 is the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "we assume that gate voltages are tuned to bring the system near the degeneracy point @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] ) where a single electron may move between the two dots with little charging energy cost . to simplify the presentation ,",
    "only one quantum level on each dot is included ; @xmath17 denotes the energy of an excess electron on the left ( right ) qd ( possibly including some charging energy ) .",
    "likewise , spin effects are neglected.@xcite thus , in the basis @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the dqd hamiltonian reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 are pauli matrices , @xmath22 is the energy level difference , and @xmath23 is the tunneling amplitude connecting the dots .",
    "notice that both @xmath24 and @xmath25 may be time dependent .",
    "the phonon bath hamiltonian has the usual form ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 where the dispersion relation @xmath28 is specified below .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction has the linear coupling form,@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of excess electrons in the @xmath31-th dot and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the dot position vectors , see fig .",

    ", we will assume that the form factor is identical for both dots and , therefore , drop the @xmath31 index hereafter . in the basis @xmath39 , @xmath19 , after dropping irrelevant constant terms , the electron - phonon interaction simplifies to @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the phonons propagate in three dimensions , while the electrons are confined to the plane of the underlying two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "notice that the electron - phonon coupling is not isotropic for the dqd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) : phonons propagating along @xmath43 and any @xmath44 do not cause any relaxation , while coupling is maximal along @xmath45 direction .",
    "we neglect any mismatch in phonon velocities at the gaas / algaas interface , where the 2deg is located .",
    "we now proceed with the born - markov - redfield treatment@xcite of this system .",
    "while the born approximation is clearly justified for weak electron - phonon interaction , the markov approximation requires , in addition , that the bath correlation time is the smallest time scale in the problem .",
    "these conditions are reasonably satisfied for lateral gaas quantum dots , as we will argue below .",

    "we now specialize to linear , isotropic acoustic phonons : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the phonon velocity .",
    "moreover , we only consider coupling to longitudinal piezoelectric phonons , neglecting the deformation potential contribution . for bulk gaas ,",
    "this is justifiable at temperatures below approximately 10  @xmath61.@xcite thus , @xmath62 is the piezoelectric constant in dimensionless form ( @xmath63 for gaas @xcite ) and @xmath64 is the unit cell volume",

    "thus , the markovian approximation can be justified for time scales @xmath78 and if all pulse operations are kept adiabatic on the scale of @xmath79 .",
    "one can operate this charge qubit in two different ways : ( i ) by pulsing the tunneling amplitude @xmath23 keeping @xmath24 constant , or ( ii ) by changing the energy level difference @xmath80 keeping @xmath25 constant ( bias pulsing ) .",
    "tunnel pulsing seems advantageous as it implies fewer decoherence channels and less leakage .",
    "however , a recent experiment used a bias pulsing scheme.@xcite    our system s hilbert space is two - dimensional by construction [ see eq .  ( [ eq : hs ] ) ] , hence there is no leakage to states outside the computational basis .",
    "we can , therefore , use square pulses instead of smooth , adiabatic ones .",

    "several experimental realizations of dqd systems recently appeared in the literature.@xcite in principle , all these setups could be driven by tunnel pulsing to manipulate charge and perform single - qubit operations . to understand how the @xmath0-factor depends on the tunneling amplitude @xmath100 in realistic conditions ,",

    "[ fig : qfactor - tc ] we only show the curve for @xmath100 up to 100  @xmath108ev .",
    "one has to recall that at these values the markov approximation used in the redfield formulation is not accurate ( see end of sec .",

    "the situation is more favorable and larger quality factors ( thus relatively less decoherence ) can be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , the one - qubit operation time , which is proportional to the period , grows linearly with @xmath0 in the region of @xmath111 , as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "our results combined with the recent experiments indicate that these other mechanisms are more relevant than phonons .",
    "we now turn to yet another possible source of decoherence : leakage to the leads when the pulse is on.@xcite to illustrate this alternative source of damping of charge oscillations , we simulate the bias - pulsing experiment of ref .   by implementing a rate equation formalism similar to",

    "these differences account for most of the discrepancy between the present and previous results .",
    "based on these findings we conclude that phonon decoherence is too weak to explain the damping of the charge oscillations seen in recent experiments.@xcite charge leakage to the leads during bias pulsing is an additional source of damping , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : respcurrent](b ) ; however , for realistic parameters,@xcite it turns out to be a weak effect as well .",

    "tunnel pulsing seems advantageous due to the smaller number of possible decoherence channels .",
    "in addition , the bias pulsing scheme , in contrast to tunnel pulsing , introduces significant loss of visibility in the charge oscillations .    in this work we did not attempt to study leakage or loss of fidelity due to non - adiabatic pulsing ,",
    "which are both important issues for _ spin_-based quantum dot qubits.@xcite moreover , we have not attempted to go beyond the markov approximation when deriving an equation of motion for the reduced density matrix .",
    "both of these restrictions in our treatment impose some limitations on the accuracy of our results , especially for large tunneling amplitudes .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that some extra insight would be gained by measuring the @xmath0-factor as a function of the tunneling amplitude @xmath100 experimentally .",
