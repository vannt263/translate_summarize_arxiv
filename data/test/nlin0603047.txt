    "recent theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that the fundamental properties of waves can be precisely engineered by introducing a periodic modulation of the medium characteristics . in particular , there appear unique possibilities to control the propagation of light in photonic structures with a periodic modulation of the optical refractive index  @xcite , and manage the flow of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in periodic potentials  @xcite .",
    "additional flexibility in tailoring wave dynamics can be realized through nonlinear self - action , that may appear due to various physical mechanisms such as light - matter interactions for optical beams or atom - atom scattering in bec .",
    "one of the key effects of nonlinearity is the suppression of the natural tendencies of localized wave packets to broaden due to dispersion or diffraction , supporting the formation of optical lattice solitons  @xcite and self - localized atomic states  @xcite .",
    "the excitation of lattice solitons and their dynamics can be described by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation when the wave propagation is primarily defined by tunneling between neighboring potential wells  @xcite .",
    "this special regime of energy flow results in special properties of discrete solitons .",
    "it was predicted theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite that the discrete solitons can freely propagate through the lattice below a certain energy threshold , whereas at higher energies the solitons become trapped at a particular lattice site .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the presence of the self - induced peierls - nabarro potential ( pnp ) barrier , defining the difference of energies between the solitons whose centers are positioned at a lattice site or in - between the neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the ability to enhance or suppress pnp may allow for precise control over transmission of higher - energy wave packets through the lattice .",
    "the pnp vanishes for discrete solitons in the framework of the ablowitz - ladik ( al ) equations  @xcite which are integrable .",
    "one of the features of the al model is nonlocal nonlinearity , as the medium response is defined by the wave amplitudes at the neighboring lattice sites , in contrast to the local on - site nonlinearity that leads to strong pnp  @xcite .",
    "however , the al model has not been directly connected to a specific physical application . on the other hand ,",
    "more recently , it was demonstrated that nonlocal nonlinearity of a more general type representing real physical systems can indeed lead to strong reduction of pnp  @xcite for lattice solitons .",
    "it was also shown that pnp can be reduced ( and even reversed ) in the case of a saturable nonlinear response  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a class of dnls equations featuring a general type of nonlinearity characterized by a nonlocal response as well as an arbitrary polynomial dependence on the intensity , that includes the case of nonlocal saturable nonlinearity .",
    "we show that , under certain conditions , the pnp can be made exactly zero .",
    "quite remarkably , the corresponding equations are generally not integrable , leading to nontrivial soliton dynamics .",
    "we present examples of equations that conserve the total energy ( or norm ) , suggesting that the predicted effects can be observed in specially engineered periodic structures .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we present the general setup of the continuum and discrete models of the present work . in section  [ sec : pnpfree ] , we derive the class of pnp - free dnls equations and extract two subclasses conserving different physical quantities . the case of cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity",
    "is considered in detail in section  [ sec : kerr ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we briefly summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "the pnp potential is a feature of discrete models and does not appear for continuous and translationally invariant nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "we demonstrate below that , by performing appropriate discretization of the continuous nls equation , it is possible to obtain a broad class of dnls models where pnp is also absent .",
    "we note that a conceptually similar approach has been developed for klein - gordon type lattices  @xcite and is now starting to emerge in nls settings as well @xcite .",
    "we also note in passing the interesting concurrent efforts but in a different direction ( namely that of obtaining exact solutions with a free parameter and demonstrating the absence for those of pn barriers ) of @xcite . here",
    ", we present our methodology for the generalized nls equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex function of two real variables ; @xmath2 is a real function of its argument and @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce the lattice sites @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing and @xmath6 we also introduce the following shorthand notations @xmath7 and will focus only on discretizations that involve such nearest neighbor sites",

    "( [ deq1 ] ) to the three - point discrete problem of the form @xmath10 whose solution can be found from a reduced two - point discrete problem @xmath11 .",
    "such a selection will entail a mono - parametric freedom for the resulting algebraic problem leading to stationary state solutions .",
    "this will , in turn , be responsible for the effective translational invariance in what follows .",
    "such models will be called the models free of peierls - nabarro potential ( pnp - free models , for short ) since their stationary solutions can be placed anywhere with respect to the lattice .    following the method proposed in @xcite",
