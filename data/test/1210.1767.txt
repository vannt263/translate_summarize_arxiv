    "considerable interest to cusped light - like wilson polygons has arisen thanks to the recently conjectured duality between the @xmath17gluon planar scattering amplitudes in the @xmath18 super - yang - mills theory and the vacuum average of planar wilson loops formed , correspondingly , by @xmath19 light - like segments connecting space - time points @xmath20 , so that their `` lengths '' @xmath21 are chosen equal to the external momenta of the @xmath17gluon amplitude ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the main observation is that the renormalization properties of these wilson loops are more intricate than those of cusped wilson loops defined on off - light - cone integration contours .",

    "it is possible , however , to construct a combined renormalization - group equation taking into account ultraviolet as well as light - cone divergences .",
    "the cusp anomalous dimension , which is the principal ingredient of this equation , is remarkably universal : it controls , e.g. , the infrared asymptotic behavior of such important quantities as the qcd and qed sudakov form factors , the gluon regge trajectory , the integrated ( collinear ) parton distribution functions at large-@xmath13 , the anomalous dimension of the heavy quark effective theory , etc . @xcite .",
    "another interesting field of application of cusped light - cone wilson lines could be transverse - momentum dependent parton densities ( tmds ) @xcite .",

    "this situation resembles the problems with renormalizability of the light - like wilson loops discussed above .",

    "<S> we propose and discuss a new approach to the analysis of the correlation functions which contain light - like wilson lines or loops , the latter being cusped in addition . </S>",
    "<S> the objects of interest are therefore the light - like wilson null - polygons , the soft factors of the parton distribution and fragmentation functions , high - energy scattering amplitudes in the eikonal approximation , gravitational wilson lines , etc . </S>",
    "<S> our method is based on a generalization of the universal quantum dynamical principle by j. schwinger and allows one to take care of extra singularities emerging due to light - like or semi - light - like cusps . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such wilson loops obey a differential equation which connects the area variations and renormalization group behavior of those objects and discuss the possible relation between geometrical structure of the loop space and area evolution of the light - like cusped wilson loops . </S>"
