    "entanglement is the property of states of multipartite quantum systems that is the most important resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "for this reason , one of the most important tasks of quantum information science is to establish entanglement at long distances in quantum networks , and to optimize final entanglement and probability of success .",
    "quantum networks @xcite play a key role in quantum information processing . here",
    "we limit our attention to those networks in which quantum states can be prepared initially and shared .",
    "that is , entanglement can be generated between neighboring or , at least , not - too - widely - separated nodes ( or stations ) .",
    "there are two instances in which the above - mentioned tasks become obviously relevant . on one hand",
    ", one can consider macroscopic quantum communication networks , such as cryptographic networks , or more generally quantum communication nets @xcite , or distributed quantum computation @xcite involving arbitrary nodes of the network .",
    "the second instance concerns microscopic or mesoscopic networks that could constitute architectures of quantum computers ( cf . ref .  ) .    despite enormous progress in experimental techniques ( cf .",
    "ref .   and references therein ) , it is in principle a very hard task to establish entanglement at large distances due to decoherence and attenuation effects .",
    "two remedies for this problem have been proposed :    * _ quantum repeaters_. this concept has been developed for 1d quantum communication chains @xcite .",
    "although the simple entanglement swapping @xcite procedure can lead to quantum communication at large distances ( see fig .  [ fig : swapping ] ) , for imperfect resources , the performance of such communication chains decays exponentially with the distance ( i.e. the number of repeaters ) .",
    "however , one can use more sophisticated quantum repeater protocols , which use purification and swapping methods that lead to polynomial decay only .",
    "* _ entanglement percolation_. recently , our collaborators , together with two of us , proposed using networks in which properties of the connectivity of the network enable the establishment of , and determine the probability of , entanglement on large distances . in refs .   and  we considered in particular _ pure - state networks _ on regular lattices , where the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) nodes share a non - maximally entangled pair of qubits , or more generally qudits ( an entangled bond ) .",
    "we searched for local operations and classical communication ( locc ) protocols that lead to establishment of entanglement between remote nodes of the network .",

    "a ) two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the form specified in ( [ stateab ] ) . after the operation ,",
    "qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be in an entangled , mixed state .",
    "b ) swapping as the first step in a repeater .",
    "c ) a 1d chain of repeaters . ]    at present , only a handful of studies that explicitly apply percolation theory to problems in quantum information have appeared in the literature . these articles , comprising refs .   and  as well as applications to cluster states ,",
    "are reviewed in ref .  .",
    "our results leading to the present work can be summarized as follows :    * for 1d chains we proved that even optimal locc strategies only allow the establishment of entanglement between distant nodes that decays exponentially with both the distance , as well as the quality of entanglement of nn bonds . * in 2d and higher dimensions , the possibilities for protocols are greatly expanded .",
    "the most straightforward , naive protocol the one we use as a baseline to evaluate other protocols is the one we term _ classical entanglement percolation _ ( cep ) , although it does involve obviously some quantum operations .",
    "this protocol begins with converting ( using locc ) each of the entangled bonds into a singlet ( _ i.e. _ maximally entangled state ) with probability @xmath4 ( the so - called singlet conversion probability ( scp ) @xcite ) .",
    "after the conversion , each of the parties ( nodes ) knows obviously which of the bonds are now perfectly entangled . using classical communications ,",
    "the parties establish whether there exists an infinite percolating cluster ( or one spanning the lattice ) and who belongs to it .",
    "then , by performing a series of entanglement swappings , it is possible to propagate entanglement between any two ( widely ) separated nodes that belong to the percolating cluster .",
    "we call this scheme `` classical '' because it essentially maps the problem onto a classical bond percolation problem @xcite , and its success or failure is equivalent to the success or failure of bond percolation in the same lattice .",
    "namely , if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lattice - dependent critical percolation threshold ( or , in other words , critical open - bond density ) , then entanglement between any two remote nodes can be established with probability @xmath7 , which asymptotically does not depend on the distance . * at the same time that we introduced cep , we presented several schemes that went beyond the simple application of singlet conversion everywhere followed by entanglement swapping along a path .",
    "we call these _ quantum entanglement percolation _ ( qep ) protocols because they use some kind of quantum pre - processing for instance quantum measurements to transform one percolation problem to another one . in these protocols cep",
    "is also used , but is preceded by application of certain locc , which remove and replace bonds in the network lattice , resulting in a new lattice geometry with fundamentally different long - range properties . the pre - processing in qep",
    "may greatly improve the possibility of entanglement percolation , either by reducing @xmath6 , or by increasing @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper we present a more systematic and thorough study of qeps based on lattice transformations .",
    "in particular , we explore the entire parameter space with the addition of monte carlo and series - expansion methods .",
    "although general principles remain to be found , we do discover certain rules and regularities governing such strategies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] ) .",

    "[ sec : models ] we formulate and describe the models and fix the notation .",

    "an overview of these methods is presented in the appendices : appendix  [ sec : majorization ] presents the necessary facts from majorization theory and singlet conversion protocols @xcite , appendix  [ sec : montecarlo ] explains some details of our monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , and finally appendix  [ sec : series ] deals with series expansions .",
    "in this section , we describe the classes of quantum networks and communication protocols that we investigated .",
    "the networks we consider consist , prior to application of communication protocols , of a collection of qubits partitioned into pairs , each pair being prepared in an identical pure state @xmath9 . with appropriate choice of bases",
    ", any such state can be written @xmath10 where the schmidt coefficients @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we identify these pairs with bonds on a two - dimensional lattice or edges on a graph , with two spatially - separated qubits , one occupying each end of the bond . at regular positions , a small set of these qubits",
    "are arranged near enough to one another to allow measurements on any subset .",
    "such a set of qubits then constitutes a vertex ( or node or site ) which is incident to each edge that contributes a qubit to the vertex .",
    "this defines a lattice to which we apply methods of statistical physics .",
    "in particular , many results on the possibility of long - range entanglement are described using percolation theory @xcite , and depend only on the graph structure of the system .      given a lattice prepared as described above , we search for the protocols consisting of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) that yield the maximum probability of achieving entanglement between two nodes separated by an arbitrarily large distance .",
    "the answer depends on the single parameter @xmath14 characterizing the state @xmath15 .",
    "even with a small palette of possible operations , finding the globally optimal solution is a difficult task .",
    "instead , we search for promising classes of protocols .",
    "the simplest protocol consists of attempting to convert the state associated with each bond to a singlet via the `` procrustean method '' of entanglement concentration , which is the optimal strategy at the level of a single bond @xcite .",
    "this conversion succeeds with probability @xmath16 ( see appendix  [ sec : majorization ] . ) , while failure leaves the pair in a state with no entanglement . in this way the system is described exactly by a bond percolation process with open - bond density @xmath4 . if there is a path of open ( maximally entangled ) bonds connecting two nodes , a sequence of entanglement swapping measurements , one at each intermediate node ,",
    "is then applied in order to entangle the first and last node .",
    "this protocol is the simplest example of classical entanglement percolation .",
    "here we review a few fundamental ideas in percolation theory necessary to analyze cep .",
    "the nodes in the lattice can be partitioned into sets such that each node within a set is connected to each other node in the set via a path of open bonds .",
    "such a set of nodes is called an open cluster , or sometimes simply a cluster .",
    "the central fact of percolation theory is that percolation processes on most commonly - studied lattices in dimension @xmath17 and higher exhibit a continuous phase transition as the bond density passes through a critical value @xmath6",
    ". for @xmath5 there exists with probability one a unique ( for the lattices we study here ) cluster of infinite mass ( number of nodes ) , while for @xmath18 all clusters are finite with probability one .",
    "it follows that improving an locc protocol to obtain a small change in @xmath4 can have a dramatic effect on the probability of long - range entanglement . in the supercritical phase ,",
    "long - range entanglement is possible , while in the subcritical phase it is not possible .",
    "serving as the order parameter is the density of the infinite cluster @xmath19 which we define via @xmath20,\\ ] ] the probability that a fixed node @xmath21 ( say , the node at the origin ) is in the the infinite cluster @xmath22 .",
    "when referring to @xmath23 on a specific lattice , we use a symbol representing the lattice as a subscript .",
    "the probability that two selected nodes are members of the same cluster decays roughly exponentially in their separation distance to an asymptotic value of @xmath24 .",
    "( the length scale of decay is the correlation length @xmath25 . )",
    "this means , for the problem at hand , that in cep the probability that information can be propagated between two nodes is asymptotically @xmath24 .",
    "it was proven in refs .   and  that cep is not the optimal strategy for establishing long - distance entanglement .",
    "the demonstration is based on applying certain locc prior to cep .",
    "all of these pre - processing locc act on pairs of qubits , and they either transform the state on a given bond , or they replace two adjacent pure - state bonds by one , in general , mixed state bond .",
    "there are essentially three types of generalized measurement used :    * _ singlet conversion _ the optimal locc singlet protocol @xcite is used in three situations . in cep with single - bond lattices we apply it directly to the state ( 1 ) , which results in the singlet conversion probability @xmath16 . if the protocol is successful , the bond that is converted to the singlet can be used for entanglement propagation ( swapping ) , otherwise it is useless . in cep with a double - bond lattice we apply it directly to the two copies of the state ( 1 ) , which lives in @xmath26 , and has schmidt coefficients @xmath27 , _ ergo _ the singlet conversion probability is @xmath28 finally , in all of the qep strategies that we study , we also apply singlet conversion to any remaining untouched bonds after the lattice transformation . *",
    "_ entanglement swapping _ this protocol  @xcite , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : swapping]a , consists of performing the so  called bell measurement on a pair of qubits ( b and c ) in a node , i.e. a von neumann measurement in a basis of 4 maximally entangled orthonormal states ( in the computational basis ) .",
    "it allows conversion of a pair of adjacent singlets into a singlet connecting end points ( a and d ) with probability 1 , i.e. allows for perfect entanglement propagation in a connected cluster of singlets . at the same time ,",
    "when applied to a pair of imperfect states ( 1 ) , it produces a mixed state , which , amazingly , has the average singlet conversion probability equal to @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , this effect can not be iterated . when applied to the mixed states ,",
    "entanglement swapping reduces the singlet conversion probability .",
    "this last point places a significant constraint on our choice of lattice transformations .",
    "+ we use entanglement swapping in both cep and qep , but the two uses have very different effects . in the the case of cep , entanglement swapping is used to locally move entanglement between neighboring nodes , an operation that is repeated in hopes of transporting entanglement over long distances ( this is , roughly speaking , a brute - force method ) . but with qep , before attempting to transfer entanglement , we search for a way to selectively apply entanglement swappings to alter the geometry of the lattice and hence its long - range connectivity properties as given by percolation theory . the goal of this paper and future work is to enumerate the rich possibilities and point a way towards a general description of qep .",
    "* _ worst case entanglement _ finally , in refs .   and   the worst case protocol was used , which maximizes minimal entanglement over all measurement outcomes .",
    "this protocol consists also of bell measurement , but the basis is computational for one qubit , and corresponding to eigenstates of @xmath29 for the second . when applied to qubits , it produces a mixed state with the property that for all measurement outcomes , the resulting pure states have the same singlet conversion probability .",
    "we will not use this protocol here .    in order to describe the lattice transformations involved in qep",

    "in fact , the lowest - order term in the expansion about @xmath66 is typically much larger than the remaining terms even relatively far from @xmath66 , with the result that most of the interesting crossover behavior in comparing protocols occurs for smaller values of @xmath4 .",
    "but this behavior does not appear when using the distillation procedure for double bonds that leads to ( [ fourqubits ] ) .",
    "the reason is that distillation produces a saturation point for @xmath19 smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "this results in a much stronger difference between classical and quantum protocols in the high - density regime than does singlet conversion on single bonds ( two - qubit pure states ) .",
    "four of the transformations produce a smaller critical density on at least one of the resulting lattices , which gives the most pronounced advantage in the regime near the critical density .",
    "the fifth example shows that on some lattices where a particular qep strategy is not advantageous , allowing bonds of different strengths @xmath4 and @xmath67 can produce regions in the phase space @xmath68 where qep is indeed advantageous .",
    "finally , consider comparing cep in which singlet conversion is applied to each bond separately , with qep that results in a single transformed lattice . in every such case",
    "we find that qep is better than cep over the entire ( non - trivial ) range of @xmath4 .",
    "it is an open question whether this is generic behavior .",
    "we analyze the results of the transformation of each lattice in three regimes : near the critical density ( or densities ) ; near @xmath66 ; and between these two regimes .",
    "arguments near the critical densities typically rely simply on the fact that long - range entanglement is impossible on a lattice with density below the critical density .",
    "these results are the most insensitive to details of the definitions of entanglement and connectivity .",
    "near @xmath66 we compute high - density expansions for @xmath19 and related quantities ( see sec .  [",

    "often the difference between the performance of cep and qep in this regime is marginal .",
    "it is important nonetheless to carry out the analysis if we hope to make general statements about transformations that hold for all @xmath4 . between the critical regime and high - density regime",
    "there are some techniques widely used in percolation theory that may be useful , such as russo s formula , which is used to prove inequalities in the rate of change of @xmath19 .",
    "however , we leave these techniques for future work and use monte carlo computations in the present paper .      in our first example",
    "we compare cep on the kagom lattice to quantum entanglement percolation consisting of transformation of the kagom lattice to the square lattice via entanglement swapping at nodes specified in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagfive ] .",
    "although we do not treat them here , there are at least two more ways to transform the kagom lattice to the square lattice using the same kind of entanglement swapping .",
