    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are cosmological explosions which produce an enormous amount of energy @xmath2erg within a few seconds to a few minutes by means of a highly relativistic jet .",
    "a grb light curve generally consists of a single or multiple broad pulses and rapid variability within the pulses on a timescale down to a few milliseconds.@xcite on the other hand , the spectrum is a continuum which is generally attributed to an optically thin synchrotron emission.@xcite interestingly , the spectrum generally shows a hard to soft evolution within the individual pulses.@xcite hence , pulses are important and should be considered independently .",

    "( b ) the @xmath5 contours of the fit parameters of the pulse - wise correlation for two redshift bins .",
    "@xcite ]    in recent works , @xcite we have given particular attention to the individual grb pulses and obtained the timing and spectral informations .",
    "we have then used the grb pulses to study grb correlations@xcite similar to the amati correlation@xcite . such studies are important due to several reasons : ( 1 ) as the correlation hold within the pulses it shows that the correlation is a pulse property , ( 2 ) it also shows that the correlation is real and not due to selection bias , ( 3 ) it provides a larger sample compared to the burst average studies . though pulse - wise grb correlation is powerful and indicates a basic mechanism of pulse generation , our pulse description is still empirical . here",
    "we review the results of our correlation studies and the possible improvements based on our new findings on the grb spectrum .",
    "we have developed a pulse model which describes a pulse simultaneously in energy and time domain.@xcite for this we use the spectral model as band function@xcite , lightcurve as norris model@xcite and spectral evolution as liang - kargatis model@xcite ( hereafter lk96 ) . our model",
    "is implemented in the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec as a table model with two parameters  the peak energy at the beginning of a pulse ( @xmath6 ) and the characteristic evolution parameter ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we apply this model on grb 090618 and generate the individual pulses .",
    "we derive various pulse properties e.g. , lightcurve and pulse width in various energies , spectral lag .",
    "a comparison with the data shows an excellent agreement .",
    "we then use this model for a set of _ fermi _ grbs with known redshift ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath6 bears a strong correlation with the energy ( @xmath9 ) within the individual pulses with a pearson coefficient , @xmath10 and a chance probability , @xmath11 .    in a recent work,@xcite",
    "we have studied pulse - wise amati correlation for a set of 19 grbs with 43 pulses .",
    "we again obtain a good correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ grb_correlation]a ) .",
    "one of the major goal of grb correlation study is their application to constrain the cosmological parameters like matter and dark energy density at high redshifts , @xmath12 compared to that provided by the type ia supernovae ( @xmath13 in optical wavelengths ) .",
    "however , we need to investigate whether the grb correlation holds for different redshifts . in fig .  [ grb_correlation]b",
    ", we plot the contours ( @xmath14 for single parameter and @xmath15 for two parameters ) of the correlation parameters for different @xmath8 bins , and we clearly see that they match within @xmath14 . hence , our correlation is stable with @xmath8 .",
    "the pulse model we have developed is an empirical one .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that all grb correlations are empirical and shows considerable data scatter .",
    "this is also found in our pulse - wise correlation study ( fig .",
    "[ grb_correlation]a ) .",
    "hence , it is important to understand the physical mechanism of pulse emission and spectral characteristics . in some studies ,",
    "the synchrotron origin of the spectrum has been challenged by observations of a spectral photon index higher than -1.5 ( or even higher than -2/3 ) , which is disallowed in the fast cooling ( slow cooling ) regime.@xcite    in recent works it is found that the grb spectrum also contains a thermal component.@xcite in general the spectrum is a combination of the thermal and non thermal emission . however , the correct shape of the components is debatable , e.g. , a blackbody+powerlaw ( bbpl)@xcite , multi - colour blackbody+powerlaw ( mbbpl)@xcite , two blackbodies+powerlaw ( 2bbpl)@xcite , 2bb+cutoff powerlaw ( 2bbcpl)@xcite etc . moreover , the thermal emission is not always statistically significant .",
    "one way to find the correct model is to analyze the data with good spectral resolution e.g. , _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , _ nustar _ , _",
    "chandra_. however , due to the focusing nature of these instruments such observations are rare .",
    "recently , we have found two such cases , grb 090618@xcite and grb 130925a.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ 2bbpl]a , we have shown the 2bbpl model fitted to the time resolved data of grb 090618 obtained from _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) and the xrt . in fig .",
    "[ 2bbpl]b the temperature and hardness evolution of this grb is compared with that found for grb 130925a observed with the xrt , the _ nustar _ and the _ chandra_. we see a remarkable similarity of the spectral evolution which denotes a common radiation mechanism .",
    "we note here that the pulse emission in grbs can have a wide variety .",
    "we have studied all such varieties and found a clear evidence of the two blackbodies in all cases , namely , ( 1 ) grbs with single pulse@xcite , ( 2 ) grbs with separable multiple pulses@xcite and ( 3 ) those having highly variable lightcurve@xcite . hence",
    ", the model appears to be a generic spectral shape .",
    "we suggest a spine - sheath jet structure to explain our observations ( see fig .",
    "[ jet]).@xcite such a structure is theoretically expected as the grb jet pierces through the envelop of the progenitor star .",
    "the two blackbodies are produced at the two photospheres of the jet , while the photons crossing the boundary layer of the spine and sheath are inverse - compotonized and form a cutoff powerlaw .",
    "in addition , internal shocks produced at larger radius will also contribute to the non - thermal emission .",
    "we are planning to pin down the mechanism by developing a spine - sheath jet model@xcite and then applying this model on a large set of grbs to obtain the physical parameters of the jet .",
    "the 2bbpl model is primarily found to be consistent with the data in kev  mev or lower ( e.g. , the xrt ) energies .",
    "it is useful to apply this model to the prompt emission data in these energies and then investigate the predicted flux in other energies . in the following we perform such analysis to see how much we can explain the emission at very high energies ( gev ) based on the spectral model fitted to the lower energy data .",
    "the very high energy ( gev ) emission is detected in some grbs with _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "this emission is delayed compared to the prompt kev ",
    "mev emission by a few seconds .",
    "it is well known that the band function can not capture the wide spectrum from kev to gev .",
    "also , the gev flux is found to be uncorrelated with the prompt kev  mev flux .",
    "it is interesting to fit the kev  mev data with the 2bbpl model and then compare with the flux at gev energies . analyzing a set grbs detected by the lat , we find a significant correlation of the gev photon fluence with that of the non - thermal ( powerlaw ) component of the 2bbpl model fitted to the kev ",
    "mev data.@xcite also , the powerlaw flux of grbs with high gev emission tend to have a delayed onset , and this component lingers at the final phase of the prompt emission ( see fig .",
    "[ delayed_pl ] ) . remembering that the gev emission is delayed and long lasting than the kev ",
    "mev emission , we strongly suggest that the powerlaw component of the 2bbpl model shares a common origin with the gev emission . in the framework of the spine - sheath jet model",
    ", this emission is produced at higher radius probably by synchrotron emission .",
    "on the other hand , the gev photons of grbs with low gev emission are probably produced due to inverse - compton of photons crossing the spine - sheath boundary .",
    "clearly such finding strongly validates the 2bbpl model .    in future",
    "we shall test whether one or more spectral components of the 2bbpl model can be used to study the grb correlation .",
    "for example , in our pulse model we have assumed that the spectral evolution is given by the lk96 law .",
    "we have found that fitting the spectrum with an additional blackbody component leads to a similar evolution .",
    "now , the blackbody temperature shows a similar behaviour as shown by the @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ lk96 ] ) .",
    "such findings give us hope to further improve the pulse description and finally obtain the fundamental grb correlation based on the physical spectral model .",
