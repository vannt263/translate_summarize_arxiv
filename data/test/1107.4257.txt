    "in many applications one faces the challenge to model objects , or parts of objects , in a mathematical framework . as an example , one important task is to extract an object from a given data set and manipulate it in a post - processing step in order to obtain further information .",
    "typical applications include medical imaging , object tracking in a sequence of images , but also object recognition , where the post - processing step consists of the comparison of the extracted object with a database of reference objects .",
    "similarly , such a comparison can be necessary in medical imaging in order to distinguish between healthy and diseased organs . to that end , however , one has to be able to decide whether two given objects are similar or not .",
    "this requires a representation of the objects that makes the application of standard similarity measures possible .    finding a suitable representation of the object of interest , depending on the type of application , is crucial as a first step . for simplicity",
    ", it is often assumed that the object is a simply connected bounded domain , allowing for the identification of the domain with its boundary . from a mathematical point of view , this assumption reduces the complexity of the representation . in addition , there exists a larger number of descriptions of boundaries than of domains , and , consequently , more mathematical tools to analyze the geometry of the underlying objects .    in 2d",
    "a common approach is to encode the contour of an object by the curvature function of its boundary curve .",
    "this approach has , for instance , been used in @xcite , where the authors set up a shape space of planar curves , where the shapes are implicitly encoded by the curvature function .",
    "the main advantage of using a differential invariant  the most prominent representative being the curvature  to represent an object is the well investigated mathematical framework of this type of invariants ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since all kinds of differential invariants are based on derivatives , they suffer from the shortcoming of being sensitive with respect to small perturbations . to bypass this shortcoming manay et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to use integral invariants instead of their differential counterparts ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "integral invariants have similar invariance properties as differential invariants , but have proven to be considerably more robust with respect to noise . their theory ,",
    "however , is not that well investigated as opposed to the theory of their differential counterparts .    beside the classical approach of differential invariants and the novel approach of integral invariants , there exist several other concepts for encoding an object .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the authors use the zero level set of a harmonic function , which is uniquely determined by prescribing two functions on the boundary of an annulus , to encode the boundary of a 2d object ( see @xcite for a generalization to compact surfaces in 3d ) .",
    "a similar encoding of the object by a function is given in the article of sharon and mumford @xcite . here ,",
    "the authors first map the 2d object , which is supposed to be a smooth and simply closed curve , to the interior of the unit disc in the complex plane via the riemann mapping theorem .",
    "this conformal mapping is composed with a second one , generated out of the exterior of the original object , and the composition is restricted to the boundary of the unit disc .",
    "thus , the final mapping , which the authors call the fingerprint of the object , is a diffeomorphism from the unit circle onto itself .",
    "one of the challenges in object encoding is the question of uniqueness of the encoding .",
    "more precisely , in many applications , e.g.  object matching , the correspondence between the object and its encoding should be one - to - one .",
    "thus , a thorough investigation of the operator that maps an object to its encoding is needed . in case of the encoding by a harmonic or conformal mapping",
    " if possible  uniqueness is well known . also for the encoding of an arc length parameterized curve by its curvature function",
    ", it is known that one obtains a one - to - one correspondence between the curve and its encoding ( up to rigid body motions ) .",
    "one even has a complete characterization of the set of functions that arise as curvature functions of a class of sufficiently regular curves ( see @xcite ) . for integral invariants",
    "the situation is different ; the cone area invariant , first introduced in @xcite , is an injective mapping independent of the space dimension , but its application is limited to star - shaped objects .",
    "in contrast , for the circular integral invariant , which is the integral invariant most common in use , there exists no proof for the uniqueness conjecture so far .",
    "this article is a contribution towards this goal : we first prove that the integral invariant is @xmath0-times continuously frchet differentiable in a neighborhood of the circle , seen as a mapping from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "then we show that the frchet differential is injective on some @xmath1-neighborhood of the circle , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the proofs of these results are based on the implicit function theorem on banach spaces and an application of riesz  schauder theory . using the injectivity result , a taylor series expansion , and an interpolation inequality for @xmath6 norms , we obtain the injectivity of the integral invariant on a @xmath7 neighborhood @xmath8 , @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , we show that , in @xmath8 , the @xmath2-norm of the difference of the integral invariants of two curves can be estimated from below by their @xmath2-distance .",
    "let @xmath9 be the space of all continuous embeddings from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "then every curve @xmath12 has a unique interior , denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "following @xcite , this allows us to introduce the circular integral invariant :    for given @xmath14 we define the _ circular integral invariant _",

    "i_{r / t}[\\gamma ] \\;.\\ ] ]    the observations above suggest to consider the integral invariant on the space @xmath27 of all curves modulo euclidean motions and reparametrizations .",
    "moreover , we assume as an additional smoothness property that the considered curves are of class @xmath28 , @xmath29",

    "in the following , we discuss the differentiability of @xmath20 and derive an analytic formula for @xmath20 and , under certain smoothness assumptions , its derivative @xmath73 valid in a neighborhood of the circle . as a first step , we recall the following result on the differentiability of the composition mapping . to that end , we need the following definitions of differentiability of mappings on banach spaces .",
