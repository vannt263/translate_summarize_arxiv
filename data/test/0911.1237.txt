    "the central topic of this paper is the discussion of pseudocontinuability for schur functions in the unit disk .",
    "pseudocontinuability is a particular type of meromorphic continuation for functions from the meromorphic nevanlinna class in the unit disk .",
    "this concept originated in shapiro s papers @xcite , @xcite and was then systematically discussed a little bit later in the context of invariant subspaces for the backward shift in the landmark paper douglas / shapiro / shields @xcite .",
    "( regarding modern treatments of this area we refer the reader to the monographs cima / ross  @xcite and ross / shapiro @xcite . )    important applications of pseudocontinuability are contained in the work of d.z .",
    "arov on darlington synthesis , @xmath4-inner functions , and related topics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite )",
    ".    a further domain of application of pseudocontinuable functions is rational approximation .",
    "this theme which originated from a series of papers by g.ts .",
    "tumarkin ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) was treated by katsnelson in @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite is recommended for some other reasons too .",
    "it contains an extensive historical overview on the investigation of pseudocontinuable functions which also takes into account matrix - valued functions .",
    "moreover , the paper @xcite is very well written from the pedagogical point of view .",
    "it strongly influenced our approach to introducing pseudocontinuable functions ( see section  [ s2 ] ) .",
    "the present paper continues recent investigations on several questions of pseudocontinuability of schur functions in the unit disk ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our main aim is to establish a direct relation between two well - known criteria for pseudocontinuability of non - inner schur functions in the unit disk ( see theorem  [ t3.9 ] and theorem [ t4.2 ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is a new characterization of pseudocontinuability of a non  inner schur function @xmath0 in the unit disk .",
    "this characterization is expressed in terms of a special orthogonal basis in an @xmath3 space on the unit circle , where @xmath1 is some probability measure on the unit circle which is canonically associated with @xmath0 ( see theorem [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s1 ]",
    ", we recall that the set of schur functions in the unit disk stands in bijective correspondences to the set of normalized carathodory functions in the unit disk and to the set of probability measures on the borel @xmath5-algebra of the unit circle .",
    "this will give us the possibility to study the pseudocontinuability of a given schur function in terms of the associated normalized carathodory function and in terms of the associated probability measure , respectively .",
    "in section  [ s2 ] ( influenced by katsnelson @xcite ) , we summarize essential facts on meromorphic functions and the concept of pseudocontinuability which is due to h.s .",

    "section  [ s3 ] contains a function ",

    "we will recognize that a function of this class admits a pseudocontinuation if and only if the associated probability measure satisfies the szeg condition and the corresponding szeg function is pseudocontinuable ( see theorem  [ t3.9 ] ) .",
    "the central theme of section  [ s4 ] is an operator ",
    "theoretic approach to the investigation of pseudocontinuability of non - inner schur functions in the unit disk .",
    "the starting point there is the observation that an arbitrary schur function can be represented as a characteristic function of some completely non  unitary contraction in a separable complex hilbert space .",
    "then the pseudocontinuability of a non - inner schur function @xmath0 can be characterized in terms of the contraction @xmath2 having @xmath0 as its characteristic function . more precisely , the maximal unilateral shifts @xmath6 and @xmath7 contained in @xmath2 and @xmath8 , respectively , have to fulfill certain conditions of mutual interrelations ( see theorem  [ t4.2 ] ) .    in section  [ s5 ] ,",
    "we start from a probability measure @xmath1 on the borel @xmath5-algebra of the unit circle .",
    "the main aim is to construct a unitary colligation @xmath9 , the characteristic function @xmath10 of which coincides with the schur function @xmath11 associated with the measure @xmath1 according to section  [ s1 ] .    in section  [ s6 ] , we consider a probability measure @xmath1 on the borel @xmath5-algebra of the unit circle for which the polynomials are non  complete in the space @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the question arises as to the existence of a natural completion of the system of orthonormal polynomials in @xmath12 to a complete orthonormal system in @xmath12 .",
    "the primary concern of section  [ s6 ] is to construct such a natural completion . in the particular case",
    "that the measure @xmath1 is associated with a pseudocontinuable non - inner schur function @xmath0 , we will show that the functions obtained by completing the orthonormal system of polynomials are boundary values of functions belonging to the meromorphic nevanlinna class in the unit disk ( see propoisition [ p6.14a ] ) .",
    "the goal of section  [ s7 ] is to reformulate the characterization of the pseudocontinuability of a non - inner schur function given by theorem  [ t4.2 ] in terms of the complete orthonormal system which was created in section  [ s6 ] ( see theorem [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "finally , section  [ s8 ] is aimed at determining and further clarifying a direct connection between the criteria of pseudocontinuability of a non - inner schur function which were pointed out in theorem  [ t3.9 ] and theorem [ t4.2 ] , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be the unit disk and the unit circle in the complex plane @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the central object in this paper is the schur class @xmath16 of all functions @xmath17 which are holomorphic in @xmath18 and satisfy @xmath19 .",

    "it follows that the orthonormal basis ( [ nr.onb ] ) is uniquely determined by the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the sequence @xmath439 arises from the result of the gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure of the sequence @xmath440^n { \\bf 1}\\right)_{n=0}^\\infty$ ] while taking into account the normalization conditions @xmath441^n { \\bf 1 } , \\tilde{\\varphi}_n \\bigr)_{l_\\mu^2 } > 0 , \\quad n\\in \\{0,1,2,\\ldots \\}.\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "the relations @xmath442 hold .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath443 and @xmath444 as in the paper @xcite , we introduce the following notion .    [ 3.14 ] the orthogonal basis @xmath445 is called the conjugate canonical orthonormal basis with respect to the canonical orthonormal basis .",
    "similar to ( [ nr.3.8 ] ) , the identity @xmath446^k { \\bf 1 }    = \\left ( \\bigvee_{k=0}^{n-1 } ( t_\\mu^\\ast)^k g_\\mu^\\ast ( 1 ) \\right ) \\oplus \\mathbb c_\\mathbb t\\ ] ] can be verified .",

    "the unitary colligation @xmath279 suggests that we consider the canonical basis ( [ nr.3.16 ] ) and the conjugate canonical basis ( [ nr.3.31 ] ) in @xmath235 . the equations ( [ nr.3.39 ] ) and ( [ nr.3.40 ] ) allow us to reformulate theorem [ t4.2 ] into the following criterion of pseudocontinuability of non - inner schur functions in terms of the canonical orthonormal basis of @xmath235 introduced in definition [ 3.5 ] .",

    "the combination of proposition [ p2.14 ] and theorem [ 4.3 ] shows that in order to establish a direct connection between the criteria of pseudocontinuability of functions belonging to @xmath162 which are contained in theorems [ t3.9 ] and [ t4.2 ] it is sufficient to verify the following statement .    [ 4.5 ] let @xmath195 and let @xmath194 be the measure associated with @xmath0 according to section  [ s1 ] .",
    "then condition in theorem  [ 4.3 ] is fulfilled if and only if the measure @xmath1 satisfies the szeg condition and there exist functions @xmath117 such that the identity holds @xmath53-a.e . on @xmath97 .",

    "then the system @xmath261 is not complete in @xmath235 .",
    "thus , as mentioned above , condition ( [ nr.3.4a ] ) is fulfilled . from the definition of the subspaces @xmath458 and @xmath459 ( see ( [ nr.d1.5c ] ) and section  [ s5 ] ) it follows that the subspaces @xmath459 and @xmath294 are invariant with respect to the operator @xmath460 . moreover , since the unitary colligation @xmath279 is simple we get @xmath461 taking into account ( [ nr.3.39 ] ) , ( [ nr.3.40 ] ) , and ( [ nr.4.2 ] ) it follows @xmath462 hence , the space @xmath463 is also invariant with respect to @xmath460 and the restriction of @xmath460 is a unilateral shift of multiplicity @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath337 be a basis function of the generating wandering subspace of the unilateral shift @xmath464 .",
    "then the function @xmath337 satisfies the conditions in lemma [ 3.9 ] .",

    "this implies @xmath470 combining this with ( [ nr.4.5 ] ) we obtain @xmath471 therefore , the unimodular function @xmath472 which is defined by @xmath473 is the @xmath474-limit of the sequence @xmath475 .",
    "thus , since the sequence @xmath476 belongs to the hardy space @xmath364 and since @xmath477 is a unimodular function , we see that there is a function @xmath478 such that its boundary function @xmath479 coincides @xmath53-a.e . on @xmath97 with @xmath477 .",

    "let @xmath116 be the set introduced in remark [ 3.1 ] .",
    "in view of @xmath274 we can assume that the boundary functions @xmath485 and @xmath486 of the inner functions @xmath484 and @xmath120 vanish on @xmath116 .",

    "we are going to prove that the function @xmath337 defined by @xmath488 belongs to the intersection of the sets described on the left - hand side of formula ( [ nr.4.2 ] ) . indeed , in view of corollary [ 3.12 ] and ( [ nr.3.40 ] ) we infer @xmath489 on the other hand , using ( [ nr.4.8 ] ) , ( [ nr.4.7 ] ) , ( [ nr.3.28 ] ) , and @xmath274 for each @xmath490 one can conclude @xmath491 thus , we get @xmath492 in view of @xmath493 we have @xmath494 consequently , by using ( [ nr.4.11 ] ) , ( [ nr.4.8 ] ) , and @xmath495 we obtain @xmath496 since @xmath497 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath235 from ( [ nr.4.10 ] ) and ( [ nr.4.13 ] ) it follows that @xmath498 combining this with ( [ nr.4.9 ] ) we see that @xmath499 by using @xmath500 , @xmath274 , and ( [ nr.4.8 ] ) we obtain @xmath501 therefore , from ( [ nr.4.14 ] ) we see @xmath502 thus , ( [ nr.4.2 ] ) is fulfilled .",

    "thus , the combination of theorem  [ 4.3 ] with theorem  [ 4.5 ] shows that the phenomenon of pseudocontinuability of a non - inner function @xmath20 is related to the fact that for the unimodular function @xmath507 an extremal situation can be met in theorem [ 4.7 ] .",
