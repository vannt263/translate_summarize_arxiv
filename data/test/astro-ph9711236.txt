    "the distribution of neutron star masses provide fundamental constraints on the equation of state of condensed matter . very precise determinations ( e.g. , thorsett et al",
    ".  @xcite , nice , sayer , &  taylor @xcite ) are available from time delays in millisecond radio - pulsars and are all consistent with 1.38 @xmath0 0.07m@xmath1 .",
    "dynamical masses can also be obtained for accreting neutron stars in x - ray binaries . in particular ,",
    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) would appear to be ideal candidates because the orbit of the two components are measurable through spectroscopic doppler shifts and x - ray pulses .",
    "this , combined with a determination of the inclination angle through x - ray eclipses ( when favourable ) leads to a full solution for the system parameters . following this strategy , six neutron star masses have been obtained , and they all lie in the range 1.01.9m@xmath1 ( see van kerkwijk , van paradijs &  zuiderwijk @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the uncertainties involved in these determinations can be quite large due to non - keplerian perturbations in the radial velocity curves .",
    "these are very difficult to assess and are caused by a variety of effects such as stellar wind contamination , tidal distortion of the companion and x - ray heating . on the other hand , mass determinations in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are very difficult to obtain both because their neutron stars do not ( usually ) pulse and the optical companions are normally overwhelmed by x - ray reprocessed radiation ( van paradijs &  mcclintock @xcite ) . only in a few exceptional cases",
    "can the companion be detected ( when it is evolved or during x - ray off - states ) and thus it becomes feasible to extract dynamical information and set constraints on the system parameters .",
    "cygnusx-2 is one of the few lmxbs in which the spectrum of the non - degenerate star is visible , contributing about 50 percent of the total visual flux .",
    "estimates of the absolute magnitude of the donor and analysis of interstellar reddening ( mcclintock et al .",
    "@xcite ) imply a distance of @xmath118kpc and hence an x - ray luminosity of @xmath12ergs@xmath4 .",
    "this large luminosity is consistent with near - eddington accretion rates onto a neutron star as typically observed in lmxbs ( e.g. , hasinger et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; the neutron star s presence in cygx-2 is also indicated by the observation of x - ray bursts ( e.g. , kuulkers , van der klis , &  van paradijs @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray intensity and energy distribution are highly variable on different time scales , tracing out a ` z ' shaped track in the so - called x - ray colour - colour diagram with three distinct spectral states ( kuulkers , van der klis , &  vaughan @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "hence it is classified as a z  source ( hasinger &  van der klis @xcite ) , the variations of which are believed to be triggered by mass transfer rate changes .",
    "multi - wavelength observations indicate that the strength of the uv continuum and the high - excitation lines are correlated with the states of the ` z ' diagram ( vrtilek et al .",
    "@xcite ; van paradijs et al .",
    "spectral type variations",
    "( in the range a5f2 ) with orbital phase have been reported , with the earliest spectral type occurring when viewing the x - ray irradiated hemisphere of the companion ( cowley , crampton , &  hutchings @xcite ) .    from 1993",
    "onwards we have collected high - resolution spectroscopy of cygx-2 with the aim of improving the system parameters and to resolve the rotation speed of the companion , thereby significantly refining the mass determination of the two components .",
    "in addition , we have searched for the presence of li in the atmosphere of the companion star ( see e.g. , martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the results and implications of which will be presented elsewhere ( martn et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we obtained 40 red spectra ( @xmath1363406800 , 0.40  pixel@xmath4 dispersion ) of cygx-2 at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , equipped with the isis triple spectrograph ( clegg et al .",
    "@xcite ) , on the nights of 1993 dec 1619 , 1994 oct 2324 , 1994 dec 25 , 1996 aug 5 , 1996 dec 3 , and 1997 aug 17 .",
    "a 0.81.3 arcsec slit was used , depending on seeing conditions , giving spectral resolutions of 2537kms@xmath4 .",
    "cu - ne arc spectra were obtained after every 1800s exposure of the target . for the sake of the spectral classification and rotational broadening analyses",
    "we also observed a grid of 34 template stars using exactly the same spectral configuration ( with the narrowest 0.8 arcsec slit ) as for cygx-2 .",
    "these stars cover a range of spectral types from a0 to f8 in luminosity classes iii , iv and v.",
    "individual radial velocities were extracted through cross - correlation of the red spectra with the template star hr2489 ( a9iii ) , after masking out the broad h@xmath14 and hei @xmath156678 emission lines . a subsequent sine wave fit to the velocity points ( fig .",
    "1 ) gave the following parameters ( after renormalising the minimum reduced @xmath16 to 1 ) : @xmath17d ; @xmath18kms@xmath4 ; @xmath19kms@xmath4 ; @xmath20 , where @xmath21 corresponds to the standard zero phase definition , i.e. , inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "these and all subsequent errors quoted are @xmath01-@xmath2 . in order to explore any non - symmetric effects in the radial velocity curve , e.g. , artificial eccentricity induced by heating of the inner face of the companion ( e.g. , davey &  smith @xcite ) , we allowed the eccentricity @xmath22 to be a free parameter in the fit .",
    "the presence of the eccentricity is only significant at the @xmath1175%  confidence level ; in this case we get @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a circular orbit represents the best description of the data points and thus we assume that our measured @xmath24 corresponds to the true velocity semi - amplitude of the companion star .",
    "our parameters are entirely consistent and substantially more accurate than those derived by cowley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and crampton &  cowley ( @xcite ) .    combining @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the expression for the mass function gives    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the system mass ratio .    using the above ephemeris we obtained a doppler - corrected spectrum of cygx-2 , in the rest frame of the secondary .",
    "a spectral type classification of a9 @xmath0 2 for the companion was then derived through two different techniques : optimal subtraction of spectral type standards in the regions @xmath1363806520 , @xmath1366206665 , @xmath1367006760 ( further details to be found in casares et al .",
    "@xcite ) and direct comparison of the fei line ratio @xmath156463/@xmath156457 .",
    "the former method was also applied to doppler sums at the two conjunction phases ( @xmath280.05 to 0.05 and 0.45 to 0.55 ) , but no spectral type variation could be found ( fig.2 ) .",
    "our result is in contradiction with cowley et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , who claim orbital variations of the companion s spectral type ( due to x - ray heating ) in the range a5f2 . however , we note that their result is based on the ratio caii  k to h , which is not a good diagnostic because the balmer series ( and perhaps also caii  k ) are clearly filled in by variable emission cores .",
    "indeed , it has been noted ( kristian , sandage , &  westphal @xcite ; cowley et al .",
    "@xcite ) that the balmer lines in cygx-2 appear _ abnormally broad _ , which is expected if the absorption cores are filled in with emission . therefore , we give more weight to the metal line ratios , which do not support spectral variations larger than two subtypes between the two conjunctions .",
    "we note that we actually detect an enhancement of the hei @xmath156678 absorption at phase 0.5 , together with an overall weakening of the metallic absorptions , produced by a @xmath1160 percent increase in the continuum .",
    "these are indications of heating effects , although spectral type variations are not significant since the relative depth of the metallic lines is maintained throughout the orbit .",
    "we also note that the absence of spectral type variations is not due to changes in the overall average x - ray luminosity over the last @xmath1120yrs .",
    "in fact , recent _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) all sky monitor measurements ( wijnands , kuulkers &  smale @xcite ) indicate the overall x - ray luminosity to be comparable to that measured during the observations of cowley et al .",
    "( 1979 ) .    in order to measure the rotational velocity of the companion star ( @xmath29 ) only the highest resolution spectra ( with a 0.8 arcsec slit ) were employed .",
    "these correspond to the nights of 1996 dec 3 and 1997 aug 17 .",
    "the technique consists of performing a @xmath30 test on the residuals after subtracting different broadened versions of our templates from the doppler corrected sum of cygx-2 .",
    "the template spectra were broadened through convolution with the rotational profile of gray ( @xcite ) which assumes a linearized limb darkening coefficient ( @xmath31 at 6500   and @xmath32k , see wade &  rucinski @xcite ) .",
    "the broadened templates were also multiplied by a variable factor to account for the continuum excess of the accretion disc , prior to subtraction .",
    "further details of this procedure can be found in , e.g. , marsh , robinson , &  wood ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of our templates are significantly broader than cygx-2 and therefore only a subset of 20 templates ( those with intrinsic broadenings @xmath3315kms@xmath4 ) were considered in this analysis .",
    "these all give @xmath29 values for cyg x-2 in the range 3039kms@xmath4 with a mean of @xmath1135.4kms@xmath4 .",
    "the use of the most appropriate template ( a9  iii ) provides @xmath34kms@xmath4 ( see fig .  3 . )",
    "the 1-@xmath2 uncertainty in @xmath29 was derived by forcing the minimum @xmath30 to increase by one ( lampton , margon &  bowyer @xcite ) , after renormalising the minimum reduced @xmath16 to 1 .",
    "however , we note that this error is purely formal and does not include sources of systematic error such as the uncertainty in the limb - darkening coefficient .",
    "more realistic estimates would be given by varying @xmath35 between its extreme values of 0 and 1 . by doing this",
    "we find a more realistic @xmath36kms@xmath4 which will be the value adopted by us hereafter . because the donor star fills its roche lobe and is synchronized with the binary motion , the rotational broadening provides a direct measurement of the binary mass ratio _ q _ through the expression ( e.g. , horne , wade &  szkody @xcite ) :    @xmath37    substituting our values of @xmath29 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "2 we find @xmath38 which , combined with eq .  1 gives @xmath39m@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of x - ray eclipses provides a severe upper limit to the inclination of @xmath6 .",
    "this provides the following 95%  confidence lower limits to the masses of the components in cygx-2 : @xmath7m@xmath1 and @xmath8m@xmath1 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "our conservative lower limit on @xmath40 is well below the minimum secondary mass of @xmath110.75m@xmath1 required in recent theoretical predictions for steady lmxb sources ( king et al .",
    "@xcite ) . imposing this condition of @xmath41m@xmath1",
    "now yields a 95%  confidence lower limit of @xmath9m@xmath1 and a 95%  confidence upper limit of @xmath10 .",
    "this would make cygx-2 the heaviest neutron star mass measured to date , and thereby provide support for stiff equations of state for nuclear matter ( e.g. , cook , shapiro , &  teukolsky @xcite ) and would contradict the `` softer '' equations of state as described in , e.g. , brown &  bethe ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume a maximum possible mass of the neutron star of @xmath113.2m@xmath1 ( e.g. , rhoades &  ruffini @xcite ) , we infer a 95%  confidence upper limit of @xmath42m@xmath1 and a 95%  confidence lower limit of @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the inclination constraints are more or less consistent with recent ellipsoidal model fits to a compilation of bv photometric light curves ( orosz &  kuulkers , in preparation ) .",
    "the rxte has discovered a maximum khz qpo frequency at 10661171 hz in 8 persistent lmxbs which , if interpreted as the orbital frequency of the last marginally stable orbit , implies neutron star masses of 2.0 @xmath0 0.2m@xmath1 ( zhang , strohmayer , &  swank @xcite , see also kaaret , ford , &  chen @xcite ) ) .",
    "recently khz qpo have also been discovered in cygx-2 ( wijnands et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so our mass estimate is in excellent agreement with that expected by zhang et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "as they noted , this would be consistent with current evolutionary scenarios for lmxbs , where neutron stars would be born at 1.4m@xmath1 but accrete at near - eddington rates for @xmath1110@xmath44 years ( van den heuvel &  bitzaraki @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical mass determinations of other persistent lmxbs with evolved secondaries ( e.g. , gx1 + 4 ) will help to construct the distribution of neutron star masses and thereby allow new constraints to be set on the equation of state of nuclear - density matter .",
    "we thank tom marsh for the use of his optimal extraction routines and the molly analysis package , and tariq shahbaz for discussions and assistance in preparing the figures .",
