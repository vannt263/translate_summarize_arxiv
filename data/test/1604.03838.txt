    "networks of semiflexible filaments and fibers are common in biological systems , where dynamic structures of tunable strength , elasticity , and adjustable response are required @xcite . from the microscopic scale of cytoskeleton to the macroscopic scale of fibrous tissue ,",
    "such networks utilize stiff or semiflexible filaments , allowing for rich mechanical response @xcite , dynamic remodelling @xcite , and controlled structural failure @xcite , while remaining an open structure allowing easy through access for solvents and solutes @xcite .",
    "inspired by these observations , filament networks are produced in industry , and now stand as a promising area in manufacturing functional materials  @xcite .",
    "the physics of a single semiflexible chain or filament is well understood with the aid of worm - like chain model , in various implementations and approximations  @xcite .",
    "the full theory is capable of accurately describing the force - extension relationship , as well as the magnitude of transverse fluctuations , for a range of filament stiffness spanning from very high ( a rigid elastic rod ) to very flexible ( a classical polymer coil ) and a range of end - to - end extensions from zero up to the full stretch where the entropic force has a characteristic divergence .",
    "when such filaments form a macroscopic crosslinked network , the main scaling features of its nonlinear mechanical response are still determined by the single filament properties , as reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "there have been many key contributions to the elastic theory of stiff and semiflexible networks , including ones highlighting the issues of strain non - affinity  @xcite .    in order to obtain the constitutive relationship of a semiflexible network ,",
    "a widely used approach follows the following procedure ( explained in detail in chapters 3,4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the shear stress on @xmath1 plane is calculated by summing the contributions of the tension along the @xmath2 axis of all the chains crossing the @xmath3 plane .",
    "this approach has been very successful in deriving viscoelastic properties of polymer solutions and melts under shear flow  @xcite ; storm et al .",
    "@xcite have applied the same stress - strain relation to a crosslinked network by assuming the affine elastic strain acting on each filament and the probability distribution of semiflexible filament length of wilhelm and frey  @xcite .",
    "this model qualitatively describes how the network behaves when being deformed ; however , it can only be used numerically ( since no closed expressions are possible ) and it omits the pre - stress acting on the chains , as in this model the tension is assumed as zero when there is no deformation .",
    "wilhelm and frey also produced a numerical simulation of filament network elasticity on their own  @xcite , using the mikado model of connectivity and athermal rigid rods as elastic elements .",
    "although important issues of percolation rigidity threshold are exposed , this work can not be used to describe most experimentally relevant ( and most biological ) filaments .",
    "more recently , palmer and boyce  @xcite proposed a closed analytical form of elastic free energy , with the corresponding constitutive relation , using the same force - extension filament relationship as storm et al .",
    "they applied the ` 8-chain model ' originally introduced in the context of ordinary rubber elasticity  @xcite with an approximate expression for individual filament elasticity applied for each strand .",
    "this might be the best attempt in formulating the nonlinear elasticity of semiflexible network to date . on the other hand , unterberger et.al .",
    "@xcite developed a ` 1-chain ' model for a network , by assuming filaments have a homogenous orientational distribution in the equilibrium system , and the average ( imposed ) stretch of the network @xmath4 is a @xmath5-root average of deformations of individual filaments : @xmath6^{1/p } / a^{1/p}$ ] , where @xmath7 is the deformation of an individual filament , @xmath5 is the averaging parameter and @xmath8 the area of the unit sphere .",
    "this procedure allows the local stretch to fluctuate around its average value , and may partly account for the nonaffinity .",
    "this model could only be applied numerically to reproduce several key mechanical features ( shear and normal stress ) .",
    "most good models discussed here make a successful fitting of shear stress data of different filament networks , which captures the generic stress - stiffening effect originating from the characteristic divergence of the force - extension curve of an individual filament .",
    "usually , the authors employ the versions of celebrated marco - siggia interpolation formula  @xcite , which gives the correct response for filaments near full - extension ( but much less so for more flexible filaments ) .",
    "in fact , the well - known mackintosh scaling of differential shear modulus with stress , @xmath9 , in the stress - stiffening regime is entirely based on the mentioned divergence of an individual filament near full extension  @xcite ( it holds even for an athermal network of undulating filaments , as long as the tensile force is proportional to the inverse - square of the compression , as is the case near full extension  @xcite ) . therefore , a mere agreement ( good fitting ) of shear stress - strain curves is not a sufficient test of different theories .",
    "in particular , they must simultaneously descibe the effect of negative normal stress in the network of stiffer filaments , with a positive normal stress ( also known as the weissenberg effect ) for networks made of more flexible chains  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that none of the mentioned theories , including the 8-chain model of palmer and boyce , are able to produce the correct normal stress , or address the network stability increasing with filament pre - tension@xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop and discuss a continuum theory of semiflexible network ( in closed analytical form ) that addresses these issues , while retaining accurate fitting of a wide range of shear stress data .",
    "before introducing free energy of a semiflexible network , we need to discuss the properties of a single semiflexible filament . a filament connecting two neighboring crosslinks in a network is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) , with coordinates @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the arc - length coordinate along the chain .",
    "different approaches to the chain ( in)extensibility have been tested over the years  @xcite , from the strict constraint to the requirement that the length of filament remains constant on average ( while small local fluctuations are allowed )  @xcite , to the models that explicitly include filament stretching  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the regime of high extension , when there are no foldbacks ( hairpins ) on the chain , all length - constraining models give the same divergence of the force - extension , @xmath12 , with the end - to - end ratio @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the end - to - end length of the filament , fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) .",

    "is calculated .",
    "there is also a weak dependence of this boundary on the magnitude of the applied shear strain , which is due to the inherent non - linearity of stress - strain response ; however , we are not showing this in the figure to avoid clutter .",
    "figure  [ map ] shows that a loose flexible network usually has a positive poynting effect , while a network of more stiff filaments has a negative poynting effect , especially when the filaments are crosslinked with increasing pre - tension .    , and filament pre - tension , @xmath37 , showing the boundaries of positive / negative poynting effect and the boundary of network stability ( the dashed line of the neutral filament , @xmath26 ,",

    "one can see from figs .  [",
    "constitutiverelation](b ) and [ actin32](b ) that the linear regime when @xmath94 persists for a different range of strain in different filaments ; the onset of hyperelastic regime is determined by how much pre - tension is in the filaments , i.e. how @xmath37 compares with @xmath165 from eq .",
    "( [ achain ] ) .",
    "the linear shear modulus @xmath80 can be easily obtained from our theory : in 3-chain model it is given by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ktaylor ] ) .",
    "the marginal rigidity condition @xmath166 determines the strand pre - tension that is required for achieving a stable network .",
    "the stability criterion here is : @xmath167 note that the expression in the right hand side is always greater than @xmath168 as defined in section 2 .",
    "flexible chains with @xmath169 are therefore always stable in the rubbery network , that is , @xmath170 always .",

    ", there have to be tensile forces acting on the crosslinked filaments in the network in order for it to be mechanically stable with a non - zero shear modulus .",
    "this notion is familiar from the `` tensegrity '' concept in biology and engineering  @xcite . for stiff athermal filament network ,",
    "the window of pre - tension between the linear modulus @xmath172 at @xmath173 , and @xmath174 at @xmath110 ( we assume inextensible chains ) is very narrow .",
    "the stability boundary of the network is plotted in fig .",
    "the condition for @xmath172 gives the equilibrium case labelled as @xmath175 in the phase diagram .",
    "however , the full analysis shows that the magnitude of the shear strain modifies the stability condition , as represented by the coloured curves for @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "this shift means that the region of mechanical stability of filament network expands on increasing deformation , which matches exactly what the recent paper by sharma _",
    "states  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in this work we develop a continuum elastic theory of a network of semiflexible filaments , by implementing the general free energy of one semiflexible chain into that of a disordered network . on reflection",
    ", we choose the 3-chain model as most closely matching the realistic system  and achieve various quite stringent fits a number of different experimental data sets over the full range of nonlinear stress - strain range .",
    "we demonstrate that the general theory produces the conditions for positive / negative poynting effect ( normal stress ) in a network under imposed shear .",
    "the greatest weakness of this model is omitting the effects of local strain non - affinity , which might play an important role when crosslink density of the network is small and filaments stiff .",
    "the effect of tensegrity , or linking of filament pre - tension to the network stability and the magnitude of the shear modulus @xmath178 is an unexpected result of this theory .",
    "the stringent match of experimental data is reassuring , and we believe that the presented analytical continuum model can provide as an efficient and portable tool for studying the mechanical properties of semiflexible networks . +",
