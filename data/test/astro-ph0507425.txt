    "asteroseismology is the only systematic technique to study the insides of a star .",
    "pulsators are fortunately found all over the h - r diagram , and allow us the opportunity to look inside different stars in various evolutionary stages .",
    "white dwarf stars are the stellar remains of 9899% of stars in the sky @xcite , and contain an archival record of their main sequence lifetime .",
    "pulsating white dwarf stars serve as effective instruments to harness this archival record .",
    "white dwarf spectra reveal that 80% of them have atmospheres dominated by hydrogen ( das ; @xcite ) .",
    "hydrogen atmosphere da white dwarfs are observed to pulsate in an instability strip located in the temperature range 1080012500k for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recent studies determine that the da instability strip is only about 10001200k in width @xcite .",
    "these da variables ( davs ) are known as the zz  ceti stars , after the proto type zz  ceti ( r548 ) of the class .    in this paper",
    "we gather the pulsation spectra of all known non - interacting zz  ceti stars with the purpose of studying their ensemble pulsation characteristics , and how these properties change across the instability strip .",
    "such a systematic study of the zz  ceti pulsators was first undertaken by pioneers in the field such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to demonstrate the distinct behavior of pulsation periods and amplitudes as a function of temperature systematically for a significant sample of davs .",
    "the sample size of known davs is now three times larger than the sample used in the last such characterization of the zz  ceti pulsators by @xcite .",
    "also , we now have better and internally consistent temperatures for these pulsators , calculated using the ml2/@xmath1 convection description ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this prescription for convection gives the best internal consistency between optical and ultra - violet ( uv ) effective temperatures , trigonometric parallaxes , v magnitudes , and gravitational redshifts @xcite .",
    "these two reasons compel us to re - examine the pulsation characteristics of the instability strip .      of the 35 new zz  ceti variables published in @xcite , hs0951 + 1312 , hs0952 + 1816 , wd1443 + 0134",
    ", wd1524 - 0030 , and wd2350 - 0054 do not have reliable spectroscopic @xmath2 and @xmath3 fits ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our sample of new zz  ceti variables discovered using spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) then consists of 30 davs from @xcite and 11 davs from @xcite .",
    "for these 41 davs , d. eisenstein derived a homogeneous and internally consistent set of @xmath2 and @xmath3 values from the sdss using model atmospheres from d. koester ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we carefully and consistently re - analyzed all of our time - series photometry data on these pulsators , acquired using the prime focus ccd camera argos @xcite on the 2.1 m telescope at mcdonald observatory . we shall henceforth refer to this set of 41 davs as the sdss zz  ceti sample with homogeneous spectroscopic fits and homogeneous time - series photometry .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have published internally consistent temperatures and @xmath3 fits for 39 davs using their latest model atmospheres ; we will henceforth refer to this second set of 39 davs as the bg04 zz  ceti sample .",
    "we compiled a corresponding set of 39 pulsation spectra from the literature , and via private communication with our colleagues .",
    "the seismic data of the bg04 zz  ceti sample was acquired by different observers using different instruments and telescopes .",
    "however a substantial amount of time - series data exists on most davs in this sample , and we utilized practically all published pulsation spectra to carefully derive well - averaged values of weighted mean period and pulsation amplitudes which we present in this paper .",
    "@xcite show evidence of a relative shift of about 200k between the sdss and bg04 zz  ceti instability strips , which also differ in shape and width .",
    "the spectra of zz  ceti stars in these samples were analyzed using different techniques and with different model atmospheres .",
    "as homogeneity is imperative , we can not merge these two samples for analyses that involve the spectroscopic temperature .",
    "however we can merge these two samples when formulating plots based solely on seismic data such as figure 3 .    during the writing of this manuscript ,",
    "25 new zz  ceti stars were submitted for publication in separate papers : silvotti et al .",
    "2005a , castanheira et al .",
    "2005 , kepler et al .",
    "2005b , gianninas",
    "2005 , and silvotti et al .",
    "this brings the total number of non - interacting zz  ceti stars known to 107 .",
    "twenty of the new davs in these papers come from the sdss .",
    "their spectroscopic @xmath2 and @xmath3 values were derived using the same technique as the 41 sdss davs discovered previously , but with a different algorithm ( version auto23 vs. auto21 used earlier ) .",
    "hence we can not include the new davs in our sdss zz  ceti sample for plots based on effective temperature , such as figures 1 and 2 . also , we find that the main purpose of the pulsation spectra presented in these papers is to demonstrate discovery of variability",
    ". such pulsation spectra may be incomplete and are not well suited for direct inclusion in most plots of this paper where ensemble homogeneity plays a big role .",
    "however we will include these variables in figure 3 ( based on seismic data ) for completeness , and show the net effect of the inclusion on the original plot .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that the non - linear pulse shapes observed in some variable white dwarfs may arise as a result of relatively thick convection zones .",
    "many frequencies are evident in these stars because the non - linearities appear as harmonics and linear combinations in our fourier transforms .",
    "we are interested in studying the pulsation characteristics of self - excited real modes in the context of this paper .",
    "hence we will disregard all harmonics and linear combination frequencies in the observed pulsation spectra throughout this paper .",
    "when our program detects a linear combination or harmonic in an observed pulsation spectrum , we typically hand - pick the lowest amplitude mode as the linear combination mode .",
    "however if we find a mode involved in two or more linear combinations , we consider it to be a linear combination mode even if it is not the lowest amplitude mode .",
    "our simplistic approach could lead us to incorrect choices ; we could be misinterpreting resonances as linear combination modes in a few cases .",
    "however any small discrepancies in values evaluated for a single star should have a minimal impact on the conclusions we draw from the ensemble .",
    "short pulsation periods ( 100300s ) in the zz  ceti stars typically have pulsation amplitudes of a few percent or smaller . long pulsation periods ( 6001000s ) typically have large amplitudes that can be as high as 10% .",
    "this correlation between the pulsation periods and amplitudes of the zz  ceti stars has been established for a long time @xcite .",
    "however the correlation of these properties with temperature had to wait more than a decade for sufficiently accurate determinations of zz  ceti temperatures .",
    "subsequently the distinct behavior of pulsation periods and amplitudes as a function of temperature was systematically demonstrated for a significant sample of davs by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "we now demonstrate and discuss these trends for the new as well as previously known davs of our two homogeneous samples .",
    "we will begin with showing how the number of observed independent modes changes across the instability strip .",
    "we expect a larger ( than intrinsic ) scatter in the number of independent modes we measure for an ensemble of zz  ceti stars due to varied detection efficiency .",
    "this partially arises because we use different instruments on different telescopes , or observe for different durations of time , and also due to the variety of weather conditions and extinction values .",
    "a fraction of the scatter in our detection efficiency is caused because zz  ceti stars have different magnitudes and different pulsation amplitudes , and the pulsation amplitudes depend on the effective wavelength of observation @xcite .    by using the sdss",
    "zz  ceti sample alone , we reduce some of this expected scatter ( see subsection 1.1 ) . to reduce the scatter additionally",
    ", we choose to limit ourselves to the magnitude range @xmath4 and to a stellar mass @xmath5 to exclude intrinsic low amplitude davs ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "reducing our magnitude range any more will take us further into the realm of small number statistics .",
    "for the subset of 23 sdss davs that fall in the chosen range , we find an average of 2.5modes / star for the hotter zz  ceti stars ( 1130011800k ) , and a slightly larger value of 3.1modes / star for the cooler zz  ceti stars ( 1080011300k ) .",
    "if we consider all the sdss davs in our sample , excluding the three massive variables ( wd0923 + 0120 , wd1711 + 6541 , & wd2159 + 1322 ) , then we find an average of 2.9modes / star for the hotter zz  ceti stars ( 1130011800k ) and 3.3modes / star for the cooler zz  ceti stars ( 1080011300k ) up to an amplitude limit of order a few mma .",
    "this may seem contrary to published literature , but we are attempting to restrict ourselves to independent self - excited modes only , rather than plot the total number of observed periodicities in the star .    the period spacing for nonradial g - modes with @xmath63 is larger than the asymptotic limit .",
    "this increase in the density of available eigenmodes as a function of period is consistent with the increase we find in the number of observed independent modes , comparing the hotter zz  ceti stars to the cooler zz  ceti stars .",
    "pulsations in zz  ceti models ( and in stars in general ) are self - driven oscillations .",
    "stochastic noise frequencies coincident with the eigenfrequencies are amplified by the driving mechanism to observable amplitudes .",
    "the blue edge of the zz  ceti instability strip occurs when the star is cool enough to have a hydrogen partial ionization zone sufficiently deep to excite global pulsations .",
    "our models suggest that the driving frequency is governed by the thermal timescale at the base of the hydrogen partial ionization zone ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as the model star cools , the base of the partial ionization zone moves deeper in the model , and the thermal timescale increases @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations by montgomery ( 2005 ) show that the thermal timescale at the base of the ionization zone @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "however recent investigations by @xcite suggest that the thermal timescale is not consistent with the mean pulsation period , although both quantities increase in the models as we traverse from the blue to the red edge of the instability strip .",
    "figure 1 shows the mean pulsation period as a function of effective temperature for davs in both the sdss and bg04 zz  ceti samples .",
    "we determine the weighted mean period ( wmp ) for each dav by weighting each period with the corresponding observed amplitude ( see equation 1 ) .",
    "@xmath9    we can now appreciate the significance of figure 1 ; the weighted mean pulsation period provides us with a method of determining the temperature of a zz  ceti star independent of spectroscopy .",
    "the respective equations of the best fit lines through the sdss and the bg04 zz  ceti samples shown in figure 1 are : @xmath10 = -0.835@xmath11 @xmath12 + 10060@xmath13@xmath14 = -0.830@xmath15 @xmath16 + 10240@xmath17    where wmp is in units of seconds and @xmath2 is in units of kelvin .",
    "it is reassuring to see an agreement in the values of the slope for both the sdss and bg04 zz  ceti samples , and gives us more confidence in using this period - temperature correlation as a means to measure the effective temperature of a dav .",
    "we can now determine a temperature for the five variables with unreliable spectroscopic fits we excluded earlier , hs0951 + 1312 , hs0952 + 1816 , wd1443 + 0134 , wd1524 - 0030 , and wd2350 - 0054 ( see table 1 in the appendix ) .",
    "we compute a sum of the squares of the * horizontal * offsets of the points in figure 1 respectively from the above best fit lines , and arrive at a seismic estimate of the average uncertainty in our spectroscopic temperature .",
    "we determine @xmath18=188.3k for the sdss zz  ceti sample , and @xmath18=185.4k for the bg04 zz  ceti sample .",
    "it is not surprising that the average @xmath2 uncertainties in both these samples turned out to be similar because zz  ceti stars in both samples define an instability strip of the same width @xmath1910001200k@xcite .",
    "we can expect that if the average @xmath2 uncertainty in the sdss sample had been significantly larger than that of the bg04 sample , the empirical width of the sdss instability strip would also have been correspondingly larger .",
    "our current temperature determinations are getting better and may be internally consistent to about 200k at present .",
    "our empirical measure of the width of the instability strip appears to have reduced from 1500k @xcite to about 10001200k @xcite .",
    "but even with our current atmospheric models we do find exceptions to this period-@xmath2 correlation , where the spectroscopic temperature does not match the pulsation properties of the zz  ceti star .",
    "for example , @xcite report the zz  ceti star wd2350 - 0054 with a dominant period close to 300s as an unusual pulsator because its sdss spectroscopic determination places it below the red edge of the instability strip at @xmath20k .",
    "@xcite report a known complex pulsator g29 - 38 @xcite as a hot zz  ceti star with @xmath21k .",
    "better s / n spectra of these and other such zz  ceti stars may reveal temperatures consistent with their observed periods .",
    "unless the pulsation characteristics themselves reveal curious features , it seems premature to conclude that the zz  ceti star in question ( with a spectroscopic temperature inconsistent with its pulsation spectrum ) is strange or abnormal in any way .",
    "measuring the pulsation periods of a zz  ceti star is a model - independent and straight forward process as opposed to a spectroscopic determination of its temperature .",
    "the instability strip spans 10001200k in temperature and about 1300s in period .",
    "the internal uncertainty in measuring temperature using spectra is typically about 200k , which is 1720% of the width of the instability strip . while even low quality photometric data will yield a period precise to at least a few seconds .",
    "for the hotter zz  ceti stars , with little or no amplitude modulation , the uncertainty in wmp constitutes less than 1% of the width of the instability strip in period .",
    "cooler zz  ceti stars with a significant amplitude modulation can exhibit pulsation spectra with a wmp different by 3060s and in a few cases even as much as 100200s . for most of the cooler",
    "zz  ceti stars , the uncertainty in wmp represents less than 5% of the width of the instability strip .",
    "we therefore expect that this method of using the wmp to effectively measure the location of a dav within the instability strip is in general more accurate and reliable than spectroscopy .",
    "any dispersion in period due to differences in stellar mass , core composition , h / he layer masses , etc .",
    ", can increase the uncertainty of determining the temperature of a given dav using this relation .",
    "we expect this may be significantly smaller than our present typical spectroscopic @xmath2 uncertainties of a few 100k .",
    "note that we do not claim that the relationship between the wmp and the temperature is linear ; a straight line is merely the simplest model fit possible to the observations shown in figure 1 , considering the large amount of scatter .",
    "we do not necessarily require a linear relation between wmp and @xmath2 for this method to work as a temperature indicator .",
    "our collaborators at the university of texas are presently investigating the interpretation of these data in terms of the theoretical models ( kim et al .",
    "2006 ; in preparation ) .",
    "the plot of wmp vs. @xmath2 is similar to comparing two independent temperature scales , each with its own independent source of uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty in spectroscopic @xmath2 depends on the quality of the spectrum , the accuracy and completeness of the model atmosphere , and the details of the algorithm used to fit the observed spectrum with the template spectra .",
    "large amplitude variables have a corresponding higher uncertainty in temperature @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in wmp comes from the quality of the photometric observations , and the amplitude modulation of the star .",
    "as long as we restrict our relative @xmath2 parameter in units of seconds in the wmp temperature scale , the uncertainty in our measurements is not related to spectroscopic temperature values at all .",
    "it is only when we attempt to translate wmp into a temperature in degree kelvin , that we have to use the relation between wmp and spectroscopic temperature . even in this case",
    ", we are still better off than the typical 200k uncertainty in spectroscopic temperature because the slopes of the best fit lines in figure 1 do not depend on a few stars , but on 3540 stars . using wmp directly as a temperature scale is non - intuitive at the present time .",
    "but this maybe worth thinking about as an alternative scale in the long run , once we improve our understanding of the relation between wmp and @xmath2 , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "we presently classify the zz  ceti stars into two groups : the hot davs and the cool davs .",
    "however a clear dividing point ( in temperature ) between these two classes does not exist to date in published literature .",
    "our present classification of these stars is thus vague in this context , although it has certainly proved to be a useful guide .",
    "the primary reason such a temperature based classification can not be well defined is because the location and width of the instability strip are model - dependent features .",
    "model atmospheres of dav stars treat convection with some parameterization , the choice of which can shift the instability strip in temperature by a few thousand k(@xcite ) .",
    "the pulsation characteristics of the zz  ceti stars helped us divide them into simple and complex pulsators in the late seventies .",
    "a decade later , we recognized that the simple pulsators that exhibit a few modes with short periods ( 200300s ) , small amplitudes ( few mma ) , sinusoidal or saw - toothed pulse shapes , and continued to show the same pulsation spectra over a few decades , were hot zz  ceti stars .",
    "we also realized that the complex pulsators that exhibit several long periods ( 6001200s ) with large amplitudes ( 40110mma ) , non - sinusoidal pulse shapes with fast rise times and slow decadence , and amplitude modulation over timescales of a few days to a few years , were cool zz  ceti stars .",
    "although we now use spectroscopic temperature as a means to classify these stars , the classification scheme came about only because we initially used the pulsation characteristics to separate these stars into two groups .",
    "we suggest a new zz  ceti classification scheme based on the wmp of these variables .",
    "we intend to retain the fundamental aspect of the previous scheme in using a temperature based classification .",
    "we have shown that wmp is also a temperature scale ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we expect that wmp serves as a more accurate and reliable @xmath2 scale than spectroscopic temperature because measuring the pulsation periods of a zz  ceti star constitutes a relatively simple , less uncertain , and model - independent exercise compared to measuring its spectroscopic temperature .",
    "we redefine the class of hot davs ( hdavs ) as zz  ceti stars with wmp@xmath22350s .",
    "we redefine the class of cool davs ( cdavs ) as zz  ceti stars with wmp@xmath23650s .",
    "we suggest introducing a new class of davs , to be called the intermediate davs ( idavs ) , as zz  ceti stars with 350@xmath24wmp@xmath24650 .",
    "this class merely forms the evolutionary subclass adjoining the hot and cool zz  ceti stars and typically encompasses those zz  ceti pulsators that show a large range of pulsation periods , e.g. hs0507 + 0435b .    for borderline cases such as g29 - 38 , when one season of observations place the dav in one class , and a second season places it in another class , then we suggest choosing the coolest class of the two possibilities .",
    "we find several cases where a cdav or an idav exhibit modes typical of the hotter pulsators , but we have not seen an instance of a hot dav exhibiting a mode typical of the cool zz  ceti stars .",
    "we show our suggested classification for most of the known non - interacting zz  ceti stars in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "note that the boundaries of 350s and 650s are arbitrary in some sense ; we merely wished to divide the instability strip into three parts and used a period histogram to fine - tune our choice . for simplicity and better readability , tables 1 and 2 in the appendix",
    "do not show all of the pulsation spectra we accrued for each star .",
    "we show multiple seasons of observations only for those davs that exhibit different frequencies and amplitudes at different times .",
    "this also helps us understand the intrinsic changes in weighted mean period and mean pulsation amplitude for such variables . to use such stars in the ensemble , we computed the weighted mean period and mean pulsation amplitude for each season of observations individually , and then included the average value in our analysis .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the pulsation spectra of the new davs .",
    "the physical quantity of interest in this subsection is the intrinsic pulsation amplitude of modes excited in the zz  ceti star .",
    "but the measured amplitudes of observed modes are most likely lower than the intrinsic amplitudes due to geometric cancellation .",
    "this effect has three independent causes : disk averaging , inclination angle , and limb darkening .",
    "we are unable to resolve the disk of the star from earth .",
    "hence the observed amplitude of each pulsation mode is lower due to a disk - averaging effect .",
    "this explains why the probability of detecting @xmath25=1 modes is higher than the detection probability for @xmath25=2 and @xmath25=3 modes .",
    "the inclination angle dictates the distribution of the bright and dark zones in our view for a given mode .",
    "eigenmodes with different @xmath26 values exhibit different cancellation patterns ( see @xcite ) .",
    "limb darkening effectively reduces the area of the stellar disk in our view , and this reduction in area depends on wavelength . at uv wavelengths ,",
    "the increased limb darkening decreases the contribution of zones near the limb . as a result , modes of higher @xmath27 are canceled less effectively in the uv compared to the low @xmath27 modes @xcite . of these three independent causes of geometric cancellation ,",
    "limb darkening is the only one that works in our favor , and provides us with a mode identification technique @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic pulsation amplitude depends on the mass of the star .",
    "nonradial g - modes have a non - negligible radial component , the amplitude of which scales with stellar mass and plays a role in dictating the amplitude of the nonradial component .",
    "the massive pulsators bpm37093 ( @xmath3=8.81 ) , wd0923 + 0120 ( @xmath3=8.74 ) , wd1711 + 6541 ( @xmath3=8.64 ) , and wd2159 + 1322 ( @xmath3=8.61 ) exhibit low amplitudes as a result of their high gravity , and hence we exclude them from section 2.3 .    figure 2 shows the square root of total power @xmath28 for 38 stars from the sdss sample ( top ) and 38 stars from the bg04 zz  ceti sample ( bottom ) , plotted as a function of their spectroscopic temperature .",
    "all of the pulsation amplitudes we report in this paper come from optical whole disk observations .",
    "we expect these are mostly low @xmath25 modes . for these reasons",
    ", we expect them to be lower than the corresponding intrinsic amplitudes due to geometric cancellation .",
    "the points that form the upper envelopes in both panels of figure 2 are then better indicators of the intrinsic amplitude at that temperature .",
    "note that in the few cases of under - resolved data , beating of closely spaced periodicities can lead us to determine a relatively smaller or larger amplitude than the observable amplitude .",
    "we expect that zz  ceti stars with a high pulsation amplitude have a corresponding higher uncertainty in temperature . for large amplitude variables , the surface temperature changes substantially during a pulsation cycle , by as much as a thousand degrees @xcite .",
    "depending on which phase of the pulsation cycle ( typical periods of 6001200s for cool davs ) we acquire the spectra and for how long , our measure of their effective temperature can be incorrect by a few hundred degrees . we can attempt to estimate this uncertainty by obtaining time - series photometry on the star simultaneous with the spectroscopic data .    at",
    "any given temperature , the apparently low amplitude variables could be suffering from extensive geometric cancellation . at the same time",
    ", the high amplitude variables with the expectedly least geometric cancellation have a proportionally high uncertainty in temperature due to the large intrinsic temperature fluctuation during a pulsation cycle .",
    "this makes the task of interpreting figure 2 difficult .",
    "there is fortunately a silver lining to this bleak cloud : zz  ceti stars are multi - mode pulsators .",
    "if a zz  ceti with 3 independent modes still exhibits a small amplitude , then it is unlikely that we are dealing with an unfavorable inclination angle in all three cases and @xmath26 .",
    "however we do not fully understand the mode selection mechanism for different @xmath26 values .",
    "also , they exhibit different cancellation patterns @xcite . ] .    instead of traditional histograms",
    ", we adopt a gaussian binning technique where each bin serves as a gaussian function instead of a box ( top - hat ) function .",
    "this is a better noise averaging technique because all points contribute to the value of each bin .",
    "although the contributions of distant points to the value of an individual bin are small , this method may not be appropriate to study sharp local trends .",
    "we are interested in slow trends across the width of the instability strip and do not hesitate to use this technique .",
    "we choose gaussian bins with @xmath29 that are an infinitesimal 1k apart from each other .",
    "we show the result as a solid line in both panels of figure 2 .",
    "both samples show an initial increase in pulsation amplitude , and are also suggestive of a decline prior to the red edge .    we established in section 2.2 how the weighted mean pulsation period correlates directly with the effective temperature of the davs for both samples .",
    "we now merge both the sdss and the bg04 samples , also including the five davs with unreliable spectroscopic fits ( see section 1.1 ) to plot the pulsation amplitude as a function of the wmp .",
    "we no longer have to worry about the internal consistency in their spectroscopic temperatures , and we can use their wmp as a @xmath2 scale .",
    "we show these 81 davs as filled circles in figure 3 .",
    "we also include the 19 new davs from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as filled squares .",
    "we have excluded the massive dav wd1337 + 0104 ( @xmath3=8.55 ) from @xcite and the low mass davs he0031 - 5525 ( @xmath3=7.65 ) & wd2135 - 0743 ( @xmath3=7.67 ) from @xcite in figure 3 .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot with better statistics than figure 2 due to the larger sample size of 100 davs .",
    "we used gaussian bins of width 75s , separated from adjacent bins by an infinitesimal amount of 1s , to produce both the curves shown in figure 3 .",
    "the solid line is the histogram determined from the 81 average mass davs of the bg04 and sdss samples , while the dotted line shows the effect of including the new 19 average mass davs .",
    "the minor difference between the two lines assures us that our conclusions are robust .",
    "we clearly see an initial increase in pulsation amplitude near the blue edge , followed by a gentle rise and then a decline prior to the red edge .",
    "we find several reasons why figure 3 looks much more convincing of a decline in amplitude before the red edge compared to figure 2 .",
    "changing from a x - axis based on spectroscopic temperature to weighted mean period allows us to include four red edge pulsators with low amplitudes , namely hs0952 + 1816 , wd1443 + 0134 , wd0249 - 0100 , and wd2307 - 0847 .",
    "secondly , we get better statistics by combining the two samples that are individually suggestive of a decline in amplitude near the red edge .",
    "lastly , we also find that the change in x - axis between figures 2 and 3 moves pulsators left and right , apparently leaving behind cleaner evidence of a decline prior to the red edge .",
    "for example , we find that the low amplitude cool dav gd154 moves from 11180k in figure 2 to 1154s in figure 3 , which corresponds to @xmath30k using the slope in the bottom panel of figure 1 as a conversion factor .",
    "we have eight pulsators with weighted mean periods of order or greater than 1000s with amplitudes near or less than 25mma .",
    "there are no high amplitude pulsators in this range , and the scatter in amplitude near the red edge is much smaller than the center of the zz  ceti instability strip .",
    "it is unlikely that unfavorable inclination angles can explain the low amplitudes of all the independent modes of all eight pulsators .",
    "@xcite established the observed red edge at 11000k , but did not see any decline in pulsation amplitude near the red edge within the instability strip , although they were searching for it .",
    "it is for the first time that we now have clear evidence of a decline in pulsation amplitude within the instability strip , just prior to the zz  ceti red edge . in other words ,",
    "the star loses pulsation energy before pulsations shut down at the red edge .",
    "this work will have implications and new constraints for our pulsation models .",
    "we find that the present large sample of non - interacting davs conforms to the well established trend of increasing pulsation periods with decreasing temperature across the instability strip .",
    "investigations of the number of observed independent modes show that hot davs have one more mode on average compared to the cool davs .",
    "we also confirm the increase in pulsation amplitude near the blue edge and find strong evidence of a decline in amplitude prior to the red edge .",
    "@xcite established the observed zz  ceti red edge at 11000k , but did not see any decline in pulsation amplitude near the red edge within the instability strip .",
    "we present the first observational evidence that shows the red edge is not an abrupt feature in zz  ceti evolution , and that the star loses pulsation energy before pulsations shut down at the red edge .",
    "this work poses new constraints on our pulsation models .",
