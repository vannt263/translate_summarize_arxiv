    "learning from multi - label data has received a lot of attention from the machine learning and data mining communities in recent years .",
    "this is partly due to the multitude of practical applications it arises in , and partly due to the interesting research challenges it presents , such as exploiting label dependencies , learning from rare labels and scaling up to large number of labels @xcite .    in several multi - label learning problems ,",
    "the labels are organized as a tree or a directed acyclic graph , and there exist approaches that exploit such structure @xcite . however , in most multi - label learning problems , flat labels are only provided without any accompanying structure .",
    "yet , it is often the case that implicit deterministic relationships exist among the labels .",
    "for example , in the imageclef 2011 photo annotation task , which motivated the present study , the learning problem involved 99 labels without any accompanying semantic meta - data , among which certain deterministic relationships did exist .",
    "for example , among the 99 labels were several groups of mutually exclusive labels , such as the four seasons _ autumn , winter , spring , summer _ and the person - related labels _ single person , small group , big group , no persons_. it also included several positive entailment ( consequence ) relationships , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "hierarchies accompanying multi - label data model positive entailment via their is - a edges , but do not model exclusion relationships .",
    "these observations motivated us to consider the automated learning of such deterministic relationships as potentially interesting and useful knowledge , and the exploitation of this knowledge for improving the accuracy of multi - label learning algorithms . while learning and/or exploiting _ deterministic _ relationships from multi - label data is not new @xcite , little progress has been achieved in this direction since then .",
    "past approaches exhibit weaknesses such as being unsuccesful in practice @xcite , lacking formal theoretical grounding @xcite and being limited to existing is - a relationships @xcite .    given an unlabeled instance @xmath2 , multi - label models can output a bipartition of the set of labels into relevant and irrelevant to @xmath2 , a ranking of all labels according to relevance with @xmath2 , marginal probabilities of relevance to @xmath2 for each label or even a joined probability distribution for all labels .",
    "the latter is less popular due to the exponential complexity it involves @xcite . among the rest ,",
    "marginal probabilities are information richer , as they can be cast into rankings after tie breaking and into bipartitions after thresholding .",
    "they are also important if optimal decision making is involved in the application at hand , which is often the case .",
    "this work presents a sound probabilistic method for enforcing adherence of the marginal probabilities of a multi - label model to automatically discovered deterministic relationships among labels .",
    "we focus on two kinds of relationships .",
    "the first one concerns pairwise _ positive entailment _ : pairs of labels , where presence of one label implies presence of the other in all instances of a dataset . the second one concerns _",
    "exclusion _ : sets of labels that do not coexist at the same instances of a dataset .",
    "these relationships are represented with a bayesian network .",
    "marginal probabilities are entered as soft evidence in the network and adjusted through probabilistic inference .",
    "our approach offers robust improvement in mean average precision compared to the standard binary relavance approach across all 12 datasets involved in our experiments .",
    "the discovery process helps interesting implicit knowledge to emerge , which could be useful in itself .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces our approach . in particular",
    ", section 2.1 discusses the discovery and section 2.2 the exploitation of entailment relationships .",
    "section 3 presents related work and contrasts it with our approach .",
    "section 4 presents the empirical work , with section 4.1 discussing datasets and experimental setup , section 4.2 presenting samples of the knowledge discovered by our approach and section 4.3 discussing comparative prediction results against binary relevance .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes the conclusions of this work and suggests future work directions .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two labels with domain @xmath5 . for simplicity , we will be using the common shortcut notation @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the following four entailment relationships can arise between the two labels :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 and equivalent contrapositive @xmath15 ( positive entailment ) 2 .",
    "@xmath16 and equivalent contrapositive @xmath17 ( positive entailment ) 3 .",
    "@xmath18 and equivalent contrapositive @xmath19 ( exclusion ) 4 .",
    "@xmath20 and equivalent contrapositive @xmath21 ( coexhaustion )    figure [ fig : contingency ] presents a contingency table for labels @xmath3 and @xmath4 , based on a multi - label dataset with @xmath22 training examples .",
    "positive entailment corresponds to @xmath23 or @xmath24 , exclusion to @xmath25 and coexhaustion to @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 corresponds to mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive labels , while @xmath28 corresponds to equivalent labels .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ tbl : both ]",
    "this work has introduced an approach that discovers entailment relationships among labels within multi - label datasets and exploits them using a sound probabilistic approach that enforces the adherence of the marginal probability estimates of multi - label learning with the discovered background knowledge .",
    "we believe that our approach can be further extended and improved in a number of directions .",
    "an important issue concerns the statistical validity of the extracted relationships , especially when based on infrequent labels .",
    "we are working on automatically selecting the minimum support per relationship in order to separate chance artifacts from confident findings , which we expect not only to improve accuracy results , but also to reduce the complexity of the discovery process . on the opposite direction",
    ", it would be also interesting to investigate whether approximate relations , where the contingency table frequencies may not necessarily be zero due to noise , can be exploited with improved results .",
    "another important direction is the generalization of our approach so as to be able to discover all types of entailments among any number of labels .    on the empirical part of this work ,",
    "we intend to apply our approach to additional datasets and to employ evaluation measures , such as log loss and squared error , that assess the quality of the predicted probabilities .",
    "we also intend to drill - down the accuracy results and discuss the extend of improvement for each label involved in one or more relationships .",
    "finally , we also intend to investigate the effect that the quality of predicted probabilities has on our approach .",
