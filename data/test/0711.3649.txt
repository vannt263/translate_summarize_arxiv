    "the optical properties of metal nanoparticles ( nps )  @xcite represent a topic of active research in several areas , like nano - optics  @xcite , solid - state physics  @xcite , biology  @xcite and photonics  @xcite .",
    "what makes them particularly attractive is their ability to sustain an electromagnetic resonance yet being much smaller than the incident wavelength .",
    "this peculiar feature originates from the existence of an electron - density mode that can couple to external radiation giving rise to a localized surface - plasmon - polariton resonance ( spr )  @xcite . in the experimental practice ,",
    "metal nps have been often studied close to interfaces and under both wide - field and tight illumination  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since the np is very small compared to the wavelength , the measured plasmon spectrum is usually only compared to theory based on plane wave ( pw ) illumination  @xcite .",
    "while the effect of supporting films and substrates has been extensively investigated  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , there is no detailed study on the spectrum of metal nps under tight illuminations  @xcite .    the electromagnetic problem of a linearly - polarized pw scattered by a spherical particle dates back to the work of mie  @xcite .",
    "after the invention of the laser , the availability of narrow band and collimated beams has posed new theoretical issues on the scattering of light by particles .",
    "morita et al .",
    "@xcite , and tsai and pogorzelski  @xcite were the first to study the case of spherical particles illuminated by a gaussian beam whose waist is smaller or larger than the particle size .",
    "a decade later , barton et al .",
    "@xcite extended the study from the far field to the near and internal fields .",
    "other authors have also considered the scattering properties of objects under gaussian illumination  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "all works have found that there is a significant deviation from the case of pw illumination if the particle size is larger than the beam waist .",
    "less attention has been given to the case of a high - numerical - aperture ( high - na ) beam incident upon a metal np  @xcite .",
    "trk et al .",
    "@xcite and challener et al .",
    "@xcite have described the high - na beam by pw expansion  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the scattering problem was solved using classical mie theory  @xcite or the finite - difference time - domain method  @xcite .",
    "although the pw expansion provides an accurate description of the electromagnetic field at the focus , it does not provide an easily accessible physical insight on the effect of strong focusing .",
    "moreover , in the mentioned studies , only selected wavelengths were considered and the modification of the plasmon spectrum was not taken into account .    the aim of this work is to study the interaction of a high - na beam with metal nps in more detail and compare it with the case of pw illumination . by solving the scattering problem using a multipole - expansion approach  @xcite ,",
    "we gain intuition on the np s optical response both in the far and near field .",
    "we show that even when the np is smaller than the focal spot , the difference in the multipole content of a high - na beam compared to a pw causes a modification of the plasmon spectrum , especially when the metal np exhibits resonances of order higher than the dipolar one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we present the analytical solution of generalized mie theory  @xcite for a high - na beam incident on a spherical np placed at the focus .",
    "we also derive formulae for the scattering and extinction cross sections and for the average intensity enhancement in the near field . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present and discuss results for gold and silver nps with a 100  nm diameter .",
    "the generalized mie theory of a high - na beam incident on a spherical np placed at the focus is carried out by expanding the electromagnetic field in multipoles .",

    "( [ einc]-[eint ] ) to compute the electromagnetic field inside and outside the np analytically .",
    "the interaction of light with material particles is usually investigated by considering far - field cross sections .",
    "the scattering and absorption cross sections , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , represent how strongly a particle scatters or absorbs light , respectively , for a given incident intensity .",
    "the total amount of power that is removed from the incident beam via scattering and absorption is proportional to the extinction cross section @xmath56  @xcite .",

( [ wsca ] ) simplifies to @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the background medium impedance . likewise , the extinguished power @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 refer to the incident field . after integration eq .",
    "( [ wext ] ) reduces to @xmath69 notice that eqs .",
    "( [ wscas ] ) and ( [ wexts ] ) have the same dependence on mie coefficients as for a pw  @xcite .",
    "since the intensity of a pw is homogeneous , the cross sections are easily obtained by dividing the scattered or extinguished powers by the illumination intensity . however , for a high - na optical system the intensity at the focus is inhomogeneous , and introducing a cross section is not straightforward .",
    "nevertheless , in order to be able to compare our results with that of a pw  @xcite , we define the cross section by dividing eq .",
    "( [ wscas ] ) and ( [ wexts ] ) by the incident intensity @xmath70 , @xmath71 here we compute the poynting vector along @xmath1 and take its average over the np @xmath72 circular section of area @xmath73 at the focal plane .",
    "far - field quantities like the cross sections do not provide information on the near field . to further compare the optical response of a np illuminated by a high - na beam with a pw , we would like to consider a parameter similar to the cross section as an estimate of the complex structure of the near field .",
    "messinger et al .",
    "@xcite have defined the near - field quantity @xmath74 by computing the scattering cross section at @xmath46 , including the radial field component , and dividing it by the np area .",
    "they also considered a similar quantity , called @xmath75 , by taking only the radial component of the scattered field .",
    "they found that @xmath75 is very close to @xmath74 because in the near - field the radial component is quite large .",
    "however , to study the near - field more precisely , one has to take into account both the incident and the scattered fields .",
    "thus we evaluate the total field intensity @xmath76 , average it over the np surface and then normalize it by the intensity at the focus to obtain an enhancement factor , @xmath77 the same average intensity enhancement can be computed for pw illumination to compare the two situations .",
    "it turns out to be more instructive if one looks at the radial and tangential components of the total field separately .",
    "therefore , we split @xmath78 into a radial @xmath79 and tangential @xmath80 average intensity enhancement . by taking advantage of the orthogonality properties of multipoles ,",

    "it can be shown that the same quantities for a np illuminated by a pw have exactly the same form , except that @xmath32 is replaced by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the multipole - expansion coefficient for a pw@xcite .",
    "when the np is very small compared to the wavelength , only the first multipole contributes to the intensity enhancement both for a high - na beam and a pw . by using the asymptotic expansions of mie coefficients and riccati - bessel functions for @xmath89  @xcite , we obtain the following simple expressions , @xmath90 , \\\\ \\label{ktenasym } k_\\mathrm{t } & = & \\frac{2}{3}\\left[\\left|\\alpha\\right|^2 -2   \\mathrm{re}\\left\\{\\alpha\\right\\ } + 1\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a quantity proportional to the np polarizability per unit volume and is given by @xmath91 equations  ( [ krenasym]-[ktenasym ] ) contain contributions from the scattered field , the incident field and their interference .",
    "similar formulae have been proposed to explain the electromagnetic contribution to surface - enhanced raman scattering in the limit of very small nps  @xcite .",
    "to understand the interaction of a high - na beam with metal nps , we choose gold and silver nps with a diameter of 100  nm embedded in low - index lossless dielectric media , such as glass ( @xmath92 ) and air ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the np size is assumed to be smaller compared to the focal spot , but sufficiently large to show deviations from pw illumination . moreover , while 100  nm gold nps exhibit mainly a dipolar spr , 100  nm silver nps can support higher - order sprs .",
    "this allows us to investigate the role of sprs in determining the optical response as a function of focusing .",
    "the analytical formulae of sec .  [ theory ] have been computed using mathematica  @xcite . since the size parameter for 100  nm nps illuminated in the wavelength range from 300  nm to 900",
    "nm is close to one , we include up to 15 multipoles in the field expansions . including more multipoles",
    "did not bring a noticeable change in our results .",
    "for modeling gold and silver nps we use the optical constants from ref .  .",
    "as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ multipole ] , if the beam gets focused more tightly , the dependence on higher - order multipoles becomes weaker compared to the case of pw illumination .",
    "since the same multipole coefficients are present also in the scattered field , we expect that the excitation of higher - order sprs will be strongly suppressed by high - na beams .",
    "figure  [ scsgold ] shows the scattering and extinction cross sections of a 100  nm gold np in glass illuminated by a pw and a high - na beam ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "since the np can support almost only a dipolar spr , the difference between the two illumination conditions is small .",
    "the spr peak is larger for a high - na beam because the average incident intensity @xmath70 is smaller than that of pw illumination , as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ scsgold]a .",
    "if we had chosen the intensity at the origin for the normalization of eqs .",
    "( [ wscas ] ) and ( [ wexts ] ) , we would have not seen an increase in the dipolar peak . for smaller gold nps ,",
    "the difference becomes negligible since the average incident intensity is computed over a smaller area .",
    "as shown in the inset , for a given np and background medium the average incident intensity depends on the wavelength and on @xmath24 .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ scsgold]b shows that the incident poynting vector is indeed completely along @xmath1 across the np , making the definition of average intensity according to eq .",
    "( [ avint ] ) a reasonable choice .",
    "figure  [ scssilver ] shows the scattering and extinction cross sections of a 100  nm silver np in glass illuminated by a pw , a tightly ( @xmath34 ) and a moderately ( @xmath35 ) focused beam . because the silver np can support higher - order sprs , the effect of focusing results in a strong suppression of the quadrupole mode at @xmath94  nm and of the next higher - order mode at @xmath95  nm . the latter is visible only in the extinction cross section because it mostly contributes to absorption rather than scattering . as in the case of gold , the dipolar resonance at @xmath96  nm",
    "is enhanced due to the average incident intensity .",
    "the difference is slightly larger than for gold because the resonance occurs at a shorter wavelength , where the focal spot and the average incident intensity are smaller ( see inset to fig .  [",
    "scsgold]a ) .",
    "therefore , by adjusting the focus one can manipulate the excitation of sprs in nps and the optical response can be significantly changed even if the np size is smaller than the focal spot . for smaller particles",
    "the differences with respect to pw illumination vanish .",
    "we now focus our attention on the near field to see how the field enhancement depends on the incident illumination .",
    "figure  [ avengold ] compares the average intensity enhancement of a 100  nm gold np in glass .",
    "since the gold np exhibits mainly a dipolar spr , also in the near field the difference between focused beam and pw is small . in contrary to fig .",
    "[ scsgold ] , the dipole peak is not enhanced by a focused beam because the normalization is with respect to the field at the origin .",
    "in fact , a closer look at the data shows that the average intensity enhancement is larger for a pw than for a focused beam at the dipolar spr .",
    "a small difference can be noticed also around @xmath97  nm , where a weak quadrupole spr exists .",
    "@xmath79 is significantly larger than @xmath80 as already found in ref .",
    ", where only the scattered field was considered .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , as predicted by the terms in eqs .",
    "( [ kren ] ) and ( [ kten ] ) , the radial and the tangential fields are maximal at different wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ avensilver ] shows that for a 100  nm silver np the average intensity enhancement does depend on the strength of focusing . like the far - field cross sections , the higher - order sprs are weakly excited by a high - na beam .",
    "therefore , the enhancement is much smaller compared to pw illumination in the spectral region where the np exhibits a quadrupole or a higher - order spr . on the other hand ,",
    "the enhancement associated with the dipolar spr is left almost unchanged .",
    "also for the silver np , @xmath79 is larger than @xmath80 even though for higher - order modes the difference is less pronounced .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that while for the dipolar spr @xmath79 and @xmath80 are maximal at different wavelengths , they reach their maxima at almost the same place for the higher - order sprs .",
    "the radial enhancement for the dipolar spr is red - shifted with respect to the dipolar peak in the far - field cross sections for both gold and silver  @xcite .",
    "the fact that in going from air to glass the sprs responsible for the near - field enhancement are red - shifted is a well established result  @xcite .",
    "however , modes higher than the quadrupole are not excited by the high - na beam ( see fig .",
    "[ avensilver ] ) . indeed , fig .",
    "[ multipole ] confirms that multipoles of order @xmath13 larger than 2 are almost negligible in the beam expansion .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ ktenasym ] ) and ( [ krenasym ] ) , in the asymptotic limit of very small nps there is no difference between pw and focused illumination because both contain the electric dipole multipole .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 provide us with a lot of information on the near field of metal nps under different illumination conditions",
    ". however , since they are average quantities , they eliminate information on the spatial distribution of the enhancement . for this reason , we have to study the electric field pattern in the vicinity of the np .",
    "we focus our attention on gold at the peak wavelength of the dipolar spr obtained from @xmath79 , since the higher - order sprs in the silver np would be weakly excited by the high - na beam .",
    "moreover , we discuss only the radial component because the tangential parts do not exhibit a large enhancement .",
    "again , it is worth mentioning that this quantity is normalized with respect to the intensity at the focus .",
    "figure  [ localen ] depicts the radial intensity enhancement for a high - na beam ( panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) and a pw ( panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) incident on a 100  nm gold np in glass . as in the case of @xmath79",
    "we consider the radial component of the total field .",
    "notice that the wavelength chosen for the high - na beam and the pw are slightly different because the dipolar peaks in fig .",
    "[ avengold ] are not exactly at the same position .",
    "we have checked that choosing the same wavelengths does not change the following results since the sprs are quite broad . for the cross cuts corresponding to the focal plane ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) )",
    "the field distribution looks very similar close to the np surface , while a deviation occurs away from it because the incident field starts to be as strong as the scattered one .",
    "the enhancement is maximal along the @xmath0 axis for both high - na beam and pw .",
    "also for the cross cuts in the @xmath98 plane ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) the patterns are quite similar in proximity of the np , but differences occur at larger distances .",
    "this can be explained by the different field profile of a high - na beam and a pw . as in the case of the far - field cross sections and the average intensity enhancement",
    ", there is no remarkable difference between a high - na beam and a pw at the dipolar spr .",
    "radial intensity enhancement as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath99 at the surface of a 100  nm gold np in glass illuminated by a high - na beam ( @xmath34 ) at @xmath100  nm and a pw at @xmath101  nm . the contribution only from the scattered field is represented by dashed lines.,width=313 ]    to have a closer look at the radial intensity enhancement of fig .",
    "[ localen ] , we plot it at the np surface as a function of @xmath4 and for @xmath99 , that is in the @xmath98 plane .",
    "figure  [ thetaen ] shows both the enhancement for the total intensity ( solid lines ) and for only the scattered intensity ( dashed lines ) .",
    "first , it is seen that the constructive interference between incident and scattered field has a non - negligible contribution to the intensity enhancement .",
    "second , the maximum for a high - na beam and a pw are not at the same location . for a high - na beam the peak value",
    "is reached at @xmath102 , while for a pw it is reached at @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the overall profile of the curves is slightly different .",
    "the enhancement for a high - na beam is more symmetric with respect to @xmath104 and broader than that for a pw . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum enhancement is larger for a pw than for a high - na beam .",
    "we have checked that when the np gets smaller these differences disappear and the maximum radial intensity enhancement occurs at @xmath104 for both illuminations .",
    "using a multipole - expansion approach we have studied the interaction of a high - na beam with noble metal nps placed at the focus and have compared the results to the case of pw illumination .",
    "the most important and general effect of focusing resides in the suppression of higher - order multipoles in the incident field expansion .",
    "consequently , even if the np supports high - order sprs , they can not be efficiently excited by a high - na beam , as we have seen for the silver np both in the far and near field .",
    "therefore , care must be taken when interpreting the plasmon spectra measured under high - na illumination .    in this work",
    "we have considered high - na beams generated by linearly - polarized light .",
    "it could be interesting to extend these investigations to radially - polarized beams , which achieve a tighter focus  @xcite .",
    "these results might find application in areas like np spectroscopy  @xcite , optical data storage  @xcite and optical forces  @xcite .",
